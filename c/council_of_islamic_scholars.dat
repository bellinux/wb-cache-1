He toured India, gave speeches, and issues fatwas for this purpose.|$|E

Following a 1999 military coup, the May 2000 constitution did not allow for freedom of religion. The new constitution of Comoros that was ratified in December 2001 did provide for [...] "the equality of all concerning rights and duties without distinctions based on sex, origin, race, religion or belief". The Article 41 of the new constitution also set up the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Ulemas (<b>Islamic</b> <b>scholars)</b> to assist the Government of Comoros in their decisions affecting the religious life in Comoros.

50|$|Buzurgmehr Yorov (Tajik: Бузургмеҳр Ёров; 9 July 1971) is a Tajik {{human rights}} lawyer {{and member of}} the {{opposition}} Social Democratic Party of Tajikistan. Throughout the 2000s, serving {{as the head of the}} legal firm Sipar, Yorov was involved in a number of high-profile legal cases, representing individuals prosecuted by the government of Tajikistan on charges deemed politically motivated. In 2011, he represented prominent religious figure and former senator Hoji Akbar Turajonzoda when the latter sued the head <b>of</b> the state-backed <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Ulems (<b>Islamic</b> <b>scholars)</b> for defamation. The case occurred amidst a government-led crackdown against the Turajonzoda brothers who frequently criticized the state religion policy. In 2013, Yorov represented Muhiddin Kabiri, the leader <b>of</b> the <b>Islamic</b> Revival Party {{and member of the}} country's parliament who had been sued by the Dushanbe Mayor's Office for criticizing the practice of massive cutting of trees in the capital. In 2014, Yorov represented Fakhriddin Zokirov, another Tajik lawyer who had been arrested on forgery charges, apparently as a retaliation for representing Zayd Saidov, a businessman and politician. He also offered to represent Alexander Sodiqov, a Canada-based PhD student who had been detained by the authorities and charged with spying and treason while conducting research in Tajikistan in June 2014. Sodiqov's family declined the offer, fearing that the outspoken lawyer's affiliation with an opposition party might politicize the case.|$|R
40|$|In {{economic}} context, BMT as {{an institution}} of fund distribution is attempting to channel appropriately the fund that has been collected {{in order to meet}} the needs of people. On one side, persons with more funds will save their funds in LKS (Islamic Financial Institution), and on other hand,there are persons with less fund but they have strong determination and capability to make businesses for living. These raise a partnership agreement so that the fund can be distributed and it can make wellbeing into reality and to obtain blessing. According to fatwa <b>of</b> MUI (<b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Indonesian <b>Islamic</b> <b>Scholars),</b> muḍārabah financing is trustworthiness in nature. The agreement needs a high level of honesty and upholds justice between the two parties. Therefore, each party must keep mutual interest. It means the Ṣāḥibul Māl cannot require Muḍārib to provide collateral, because Muḍārib is only a capital manager. Fiqh does not say that collateral is one of requirements in the agreement. It is encouraging author to do a deep research on “Islamic viewpoint on collateral function in muḍārabah financing (a case study in KJKS BMT Surya Madani of Boyolali). Purpose of the research is to obtain understanding about function of collateral required in muḍārabah financing applied in muḍārabah financing of KJKS BMT Surya Madani of Boyolali, and to get information on Islamic viewpoint on collateral function in muḍārabah financing. The research is a field research with descriptive-qualitative approach. Method of data collection has used observation, interview and documentation. The data has been analyzed descriptively. Based on results of the research, it can be concluded that collateral requirement applied in muḍārabah financing of BMT Surya Madani is in accordance with Islamic Law, because the collateral function is to protect Ṣāḥibul Māl from risk of failure in part of Muḍārib and to protect fund provided by BMT to Muḍārib, considering the fund is not exclusive property of the BMT but it is public property. And the collateral can be sold as exchange of the fund that is failed to repay if it is proved that Muḍārib has made error intentionally, negligence or failed to satisfy the agreement...|$|R
50|$|Muhammad Ismail {{started the}} Young Muslim Society in Tirunelveli Petai in 1909. He was {{instrumental}} in establishing Majlis-ul-Ulama (<b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Scholars)</b> in 1918. He {{became a member of}} the Muslim league rose through its ranks. In 1945, he became the president of the Madras Presidency unit of the Muslim league. He led the Madras State Muslim League in the 1946 Assembly elections, when the league won 28 seats (all the seats reserved for Muslims in the Presidency). The league emerged as the second largest party in the assembly after the Indian National Congress. Ismail became the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Assembly during 1946-52. When the provincial assemblies elected members to serve in the Indian Constituent Assembly which also doubled as the first Parliament of independent India, Ismail was elected to the Constituent Assembly from Madras Presidency.|$|E
50|$|Following Indonesian {{independence}} in 1950, the political milieu was fraught with competing interests {{between the military}} and the Partai Nasional Indonesia (National Indonesia Party, or PNI) represented by Sukarno, Islamic groups such as Nahdlatul Ulama (<b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Scholars,</b> NU), PKI, and other women’s organizations all vying for legitimacy within Indonesia’s new parliamentary democracy. Scholars agree that in newly independent Indonesia, the short-lived democracy allowed a new space for women’s organizations to flourish in their struggle for equal rights to political participation, economic opportunities and “social and cultural” spheres. The new political freedom of the period allowed the full participation of women’s organizations to push for equal political, economic, and social rights. As Blackburn relates, however, the lack of resources made the task of implementing policies aimed at gender equality, such as adult literacy, education, and equal pay for civil servants, difficult. Nonetheless, this period was essential for establishing political equality for men and women - seen in the constitution that provided “the right to vote, participate in government and hold office” for men and women.|$|E
