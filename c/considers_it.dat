5|$|Due to its {{diminutive}} size, the Church of St Nicholas {{was probably}} not constructed as an independent church. A legend links the church to {{the name of an}} unidentified local feudal lord named Nikola (Nicholas) as his final resting place, though archaeologist Nikola Mavrodinov <b>considers</b> <b>it</b> more likely that it was possibly a chapel or a cemetery church attached to a larger place of worship. The larger church was perhaps pulled down during the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria (post-14th century). While the Church of St Nicholas was not destroyed, its renovation was prohibited by the Ottomans, thus it gradually fell into ruin.|$|E

5|$|In Bandung, Hasan {{works for}} the Japanese {{occupation}} government and lives an ascetic lifestyle, often fasting {{for days on end}} and dunking himself into a river to refresh his body between evening and morning prayers. While there, he meets his childhood friend Rusli, who introduces Hasan to his friend Kartini. Seeing that Rusli and Kartini are atheistic Marxist-Leninists, Hasan <b>considers</b> <b>it</b> his duty to return them to Islam. However, he finds himself unable to address Rusli's arguments against religion and begins doubting his faith. Soon Hasan becomes increasingly divorced from his religious upbringing, at one time skipping the mandatory maghrib prayer to watch a movie with Kartini. Through Rusli, Hasan is introduced to people from different ideologies, including the anarcho-nihilist playboy Anwar; he also begins courting Kartini.|$|E
5|$|Little is {{recorded}} of MacGregor's childhood. After his father's death in 1794, {{he and his}} two sisters were raised primarily by his mother {{with the help of}} various relatives. MacGregor's biographer David Sinclair speculates that he would probably have spoken mainly Gaelic during his early childhood, and learned English only after starting school around the age of five-and-a-half. MacGregor would claim in later life to have studied at the University of Edinburgh between 1802 and 1803; records of this do not survive as he did not take a degree, but Sinclair <b>considers</b> <b>it</b> plausible, citing MacGregor's apparent sophistication and his mother's connections in Edinburgh.|$|E

5|$|Clock Tower was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} about 30 people and was the first game at Human Entertainment to utilize a 3D graphics engine, although team veterans preferred to have used 2D graphics instead. At first, director Hifumi Kono was not interested in working on a sequel to the first Clock Tower, but after seeing the technical possibilities with newly released hardware of the time, he agreed. For Kono, {{one of the most difficult}} parts of developing Clock Tower was choosing the platform. At the time, the PlayStation and Sega Saturn were already on the market. The Saturn was seen as an icon of next-generation gaming with games like Virtua Fighter (1994). The PlayStation was new to the industry, and despite having a preliminary lead in popularity over the Saturn, its future was uncertain. Meanwhile, the Nintendo 64 was scheduled to arrive on the market soon, coming off the success of the Super Nintendo. Kono eventually settled on the PlayStation, and in retrospect <b>considers</b> <b>it</b> the best choice he could have made since the console's future success helped Clock Tower sell better than expected.|$|E
