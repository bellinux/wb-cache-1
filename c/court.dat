5|$|After Boldt's decision, the Washington Department of Fisheries issued new {{regulations}} {{in compliance with}} the decision. The Puget Sound Gillnetters Association and the Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association both filed lawsuits in state <b>court</b> to block the {{new regulations}}. These private concerns won at both the trial <b>court</b> and at the Washington Supreme <b>Court.</b> Washington Attorney General Slade Gorton, representing the state of Washington, supported the position of the private concerns and opposed the position of the United States and the tribes. The United States Supreme <b>Court</b> granted certiorari and vacated the decision of the Washington Supreme <b>Court.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the <b>Court</b> of Appeals and replacing it with a new <b>court.</b> Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original <b>court</b> continued to claim authority as the <b>court</b> of last resort in the state; during {{what became known as the}} Old Court-New <b>Court</b> controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was a politically tumultuous time.|$|E
50|$|There are {{specialised}} <b>courts</b> formed {{within the}} system of public courts: juvenile <b>courts,</b> human rights <b>courts,</b> labour <b>courts,</b> commercial <b>courts,</b> fishery <b>courts</b> and anti-corruption <b>courts.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme <b>Court</b> can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} the Oregon Supreme <b>Court,</b> they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme <b>Court.</b> The U.S. Supreme <b>Court</b> can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme <b>Court</b> if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon Supreme <b>Court</b> is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme <b>Court</b> cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme <b>Court</b> can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme <b>Court,</b> decisions of the <b>court</b> can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the <b>court</b> can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E
5|$|And upon a like process , may final {{judgments}} and decrees in civil actions, and suits in equity in a circuit <b>court,</b> brought there by original process, or removed there from courts {{of the several}} States, or removed there by appeal from a district <b>court</b> where the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of two thousand dollars, exclusive of costs, be re-examined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme <b>Court,</b> the citation being in such case signed by a judge of such circuit <b>court,</b> or justice of the Supreme <b>Court,</b> and the adverse party having at least thirty days’ notice.|$|E

5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the <b>Court</b> {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not that {{the statute of limitations}} would not begin to run.

5|$|As {{the county}} seat of Washtenaw County, the Washtenaw County Trial <b>Court</b> (22nd Circuit <b>Court)</b> is located in Ann Arbor at the Washtenaw County Courthouse on Main Street.

Seven judges serve on the <b>court.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the {{economic}} situation in the state improved {{in the second half}} of the 1820s, the Old <b>Court</b> supporters regained control of both houses of the General Assembly. They abolished the New <b>Court</b> and restored the Old <b>Court</b> to power. In an 1829 case, the <b>Court</b> nullified decisions rendered by the New <b>Court.</b> In a 1935 case, the <b>Court</b> struck all the New <b>Court</b> cases from Kentucky common law.|$|E

5|$|As {{the seat}} of the Government of West Bengal, Kolkata is home to not only the offices of the local {{governing}} agencies, but also the West Bengal Legislative Assembly; the state secretariat, which is housed in the Writers' Building; and the Calcutta High <b>Court.</b> Most government establishments and institutions are housed in the centre of the city in B. B. D. Bagh (formerly known as Dalhousie Square). The Calcutta High <b>Court</b> is the oldest High <b>Court</b> in India. It was preceded by the Supreme <b>Court</b> of Judicature at Fort William which was established in 1774. The Calcutta High <b>Court</b> has jurisdiction over the state of West Bengal and the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Kolkata has lower courts: the <b>Court</b> of Small Causes and the City Civil <b>Court</b> decide civil matters; the Sessions <b>Court</b> rules in criminal cases. The Kolkata Police, headed by a police commissioner, is overseen by the West Bengal Ministry of Home Affairs. The Kolkata district elects two representatives to India's lower house, the Lok Sabha, and 11representatives to the state legislative assembly.|$|E

5|$|By 1826, the {{economic}} climate {{in the state}} had improved significantly. Seeing the resultant upsurge in Old <b>Court</b> support, {{two of the four}} New <b>Court</b> justices resigned. Desha offered the appointments to three different individuals, all of whom ignored or rejected them. John Telemachus Johnson finally accepted the appointment in April 1826, and the New <b>Court</b> met with only three justices during its 1826 term. In the August 1826 elections, the Old <b>Court</b> Party won majorities of 5644 in the House and 2216 in the Senate. Desha again encouraged the legislators to compromise to resolve the <b>court</b> impasse. The Old <b>Court</b> majorities in both houses, however, completely repudiated the New <b>Court,</b> passing a bill to restore the Old <b>Court</b> and overturn all legislation related to the New <b>Court.</b> Desha vetoed the bill, and scolded the legislators for passing a blatantly partisan bill as opposed to a compromise measure. The General Assembly overrode Desha's veto on January 1, 1827. In a conciliatory move, the Senate confirmed Desha's appointment of George M. Bibb, a New <b>Court</b> partisan, to a position on the re-empowered Old <b>Court</b> after John Boyle resigned to accept a federal judgeship in November 1826.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{was drawn}} back into public service by the Old <b>Court</b> – New <b>Court</b> controversy. When {{legislation}} aimed at providing {{relief to the}} state's debtors was struck down by the Kentucky <b>Court</b> of Appeals, supporters of the legislation in the General Assembly passed a bill abolishing the <b>Court</b> and creating a new <b>court,</b> which they stocked with sympathetic justices. Opponents of the legislation held that the Assembly's action was unconstitutional, and for a time, both courts claimed authority as the <b>court</b> of last resort in the state. Though he had {{served as president of}} the New Court-backed Bank of the Commonwealth since its formation in 1820, Crittenden publicly identified himself with the Old <b>Court</b> supporters in April 1825. In the legislative election of 1825, friends called on Crittenden to seek election to the state House of Representatives. Many believed that he was the only Old <b>Court</b> supporter that commanded enough respect to win one of the two seats allotted to Franklin County, a bastion of the New <b>Court.</b> When Crittenden consented to run, New <b>Court</b> supporters nominated the state's Attorney General Solomon P. Sharp and Lewis Sanders, a prominent lawyer. Crittenden and Sharp were elected to the two seats.|$|E
5|$|Darby denied {{involvement}} with the murder, claiming that New <b>Court</b> partisans such as Francis P. Blair and Amos Kendall were seeking to defame him. He also countered that Eliza Sharp's letter to the New <b>Court</b> Argus was written by New <b>Court</b> supporters, including Kendall, the newspaper's editor. The claims and counterclaims {{between the two sides}} reached such an extreme that an 1826 letter in the New <b>Court</b> Argus suggested that New <b>Court</b> supporters had instigated Sharp's murder in order to blame Old <b>Court</b> partisans and affix a stigma to them.|$|E
