40|$|This paper investigates {{traditional}} {{financing and}} distant trades during modernization process of financial industry in Japan. Especially, {{a case of}} Yamaguchi prefecture in the 1870 s is focused on. At {{the beginning of the}} Meiji era, although the system of the remittance draft was sufficiently developed, that of the <b>commercial</b> <b>bill,</b> which should be crucial for distant trades to expand, was in an undeveloped stage. In such a stage, what sustained the expanding distant trade? To answer the question, this paper investigates the commodity collateral loan, which had developed through the Tokugawa era. "Jun-eki-sha", which was established in 1874 at Yamaguchi prefecture, is the one of the representatives of such a traditional financial organization. Through the investigation of their books, "Jun-eki-sha" was found to be managed rather healthily, and it provided the commission merchants with the short term operating capital. Thus, expanding trades at the begging of the Meiji era were sustained, at least partially, by the heritage from the Tokugawa era: That is, the commodity collateral loan.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an econometric {{model of the}} {{aggregate}} behaviour of the Australian trading banks, using monthly data from January 1974 to June 1980. There are two reasons for this study. First, {{there have been several}} changes in the institutional environment in which banks operate as a consequence of some deregulation and attempts by the financial sector to circumvent some regulation. Hence, {{there is a need to}} focus attention on a period in which government regulation is relatively homogeneous. Second, by using monthly data of reatively recent vintage some better idea of the dynamics of portfolio adjustment by the banks will be obtained. Previous studies have frequently made use of relatively long runs of quarterly data and, for the most part, have found lengthy adjustment lags. The estimated model comprises ten behavioural equations and one identity. There are equations for demand deposits, fixed deposits, negotiable certificates of deposit, overdraft advances and <b>commercial</b> <b>bill</b> acceptances, all of which have been modelled as being determined by the non-bank public. In turn, the banks are assumed to determine the supply of negotiable certificates of deposit, fully drawn loans, overdraft limits, bill acceptance limits and the stock of excess liquid assets (determined residually). There is also an equation for the interest rate on commercial bills. The dynamic simulation properties of the model are also reported, as are the results of three counterfactual experiments. Broadly speaking, the results support the theoretical model that is presented in an appendix. Adjustment by both the banks and the non-bank public is rapid, with most average lages being less than four months. ...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The General Services Administration (GSA) awarded FTS 2001 contracts to Sprint and MCI Worldcom to provide long distance telecommunications services to federal agencies. The federal government began the sizable and complex effort of switching from the existing FTS 2000 contracts to FTS 2001 in June 1999. Several implementation issues have delayed this transition. One of these issues concerns the billing problems experienced by GSA and its contractors. GAO found that the billing problems often arose from changes in contracts and services. According GSA, these issues also arose from the differences between contractors' <b>commercial</b> <b>billing</b> practices and the government's practices. Because these billing problems were not promptly resolved, they had an adverse effect on the transition progress. GSA is taking steps to resolve current billing problems. It is tracking issues as they arise, {{and it is now}} trying to resolve 12 issues still outstanding with Sprint and MCI WorldCom, including the problem of <b>commercial</b> <b>billing.</b> In addition, GSA's Office of Inspector General recently began a review of the FTS 2001 billing area, which might also identify ways to prevent future billing problems. Another issue that affected the transition progress concerns the databases that supported the transition process. GAO found that although GSA developed an automated system to track transition data and develop reports, the FTS 2001 contractors did not furnish GSA with the data it needed to populate that management system's database. As a result, GSA and agency transition managers did not receive the timely and up-to-date information they needed to effectively plan and manage transition activities. ...|$|R
