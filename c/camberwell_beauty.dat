5|$|The egg stage lasts a {{few weeks}} in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, {{especially}} in temperate regions, go through a diapause (resting) stage, and the hatching may take place only in spring. Some temperate region butterflies, such as the <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty,</b> lay their eggs {{in the spring and}} have them hatch in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, hummingbird hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} seen, {{particularly in the}} woods at Holkham, along with the common butterfly and moth species. In some years the clouded yellow, <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty,</b> painted lady or diamondback moth may be seen, and the silver Y can sometimes occur in huge numbers. The dune tiger beetle is a nationally rare denizen of moist sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} {{seen in the}} woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a clouded yellow or <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty</b> may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies {{can be found in the}} dunes, where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, southern hawker and ruddy darter.|$|E
5000|$|Yemi is {{an immensely}} {{powerful}} young child, with power beyond other magic users (for instance, {{he manages to}} hold his own against a combined assault by hundreds of Griddas in the third book). He {{has the ability to}} take aggressively cast spells and modify the spells of others. He can also [...] "borrow" [...] magic from other people, using it to enhance his own. He is constantly followed by animals, and by his pet butterflies, which are all <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauties.</b>|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} few weeks I was very unwell and could not go far from the house. The country was covered with low spiny shrubs and acacias, except in a little valley where a stream came down from the hills, where some fine trees and bushes shaded the water and formed a very {{pleasant}} place to ramble up. There were plenty of birds about, and of a tolerable variety of species; but very few of them were gaily coloured. Indeed, with one or two exceptions, the birds of this tropical island were hardly so ornamental as those of Great Britain. Beetles were so scarce that a collector might fairly say there were none, as the few obscure or uninteresting species would not repay him for the search. The only insects at all remarkable or interesting were the butterflies, which, though comparatively few in species, were sufficiently abundant, and comprised a large proportion of new or rare sorts. The banks of the stream formed my best collecting-ground, and I daily wandered up and down its shady bed, which about a mile up became rocky and precipitous. Here I obtained the rare and beautiful swallow-tail butterflies, Papilio aenomaus and P. liris; the males of which are quite unlike each other, and belong in fact to distinct sections of the genus, while the females are so much alike that they are undistinguishable on the wing, and to an uneducated eye equally so in the cabinet. Several other beautiful butterflies rewarded my search in this place, among which I may especially mention the Cethosia leschenaultii, whose wings of the deepest purple are bordered with buff in such a manner as to resemble at first sight our own <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty,</b> although it belongs to a different genus. The most abundant butterflies were the whites and yellows (Pieridae), several of which I had already found at Lombock and at Coupang, while others were new to me.|$|E
60|$|To {{pass from}} little girls to little boys {{is to go}} into quite another, an inferior, coarser world. No doubt there are {{wonderful}} little boys, but as a rule their wonderfulness consists in a precocious intellect: this kind doesn't appeal to me, so that if I were to say anything on the matter, {{it would be a}} prejudiced judgment. Even the ordinary civilised little boy, the nice little gentleman who is as much at home in the drawing-room as at his desk in the school-room or with a bat in the playing-field--even that harmless little person seems somehow unnatural, or denaturalised to my primitive taste. A result, I will have it, of improper treatment. He has been under the tap, too thoroughly scrubbed, boiled, strained and served up with melted butter and a sprig of parsley for ornament in a gilt-edged dish. I prefer him raw, and would rather have the street-Arab, if in town, and the unkempt, rough and tough cottage boy in the country. But take them civilised or natural, those who love and observe little children no more expect to find that peculiar exquisite charm of the girl-child which I have endeavoured to describe in the boy, than they would expect the music of the wood-lark and the airy fairy grace and beauty of the grey wagtail in Philip Sparrow. And yet, incredible as it seems, that very quality of the miraculous little girl is sometimes found in the boy and, with it, strange to say, the boy's proper mind and spirit. The child lover will meet with one of that kind once in ten years, or not so often--not oftener than a collector of butterflies will meet with a <b>Camberwell</b> <b>Beauty.</b> The miraculous little girl, we know, is not more uncommon than the Painted Lady, or White Admiral. And I will here give a picture of such a boy--the child associated in my mind with a spray of southernwood.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty</b> (also <b>Camberwell</b> <b>Beauty)</b> is a {{butterfly}} (Nymphalis antiopa) which is rarely {{found in the}} UK - it is so named because two examples were first identified on Coldharbour Lane, Camberwell in 1748. A large mosaic of the <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty</b> used to adorn the Samuel Jones paper factory on Southampton Way. The paper factory has since been demolished but the mosaic was removed and re-installed {{on the side of}} Lynn Boxing Club on Wells Way.|$|E

5000|$|This species {{looks very}} similar to the small {{tortoiseshell}} (Aglais urticae), but it is more closely related to the <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nymphalis antiopa, {{known as}} the {{mourning}} cloak in North America and the <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty</b> in Britain, is a large butterfly native to Eurasia and North America.|$|E
50|$|A {{possible}} derivation of {{the name}} is Cool Arbour Lane, dating from the time Camberwell was in the country. This is cited in 'The Streets' by Anthony Quinn (2012) as the place the <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty</b> was first sighted.|$|E
50|$|The rare migrant butterfly, the <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty</b> (Nymphalis antiopa) was {{so named}} after the {{discovery}} of two specimens in Coldharbour Lane in 1748. The butterflies had probably arrived as stowaways on ships delivering timber from Scandinavia to the Surrey Docks two miles to the north.|$|E
50|$|The name {{originated}} from {{the discovery of}} two individuals at Coldharbour Lane in Camberwell in August 1748. Camberwell is in South London, about three miles south of London Bridge—in reporting this, the author Moses Harris named the species grand surprise or <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty</b> (Bretherton & Emmet, 1990).|$|E

50|$|Over 1000 {{species of}} Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) have been {{recorded}} at Minsmere. The 32 recorded butterfly species include the silver-studded blue, the <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty</b> and the Queen of Spain fritillary. In September 2004 the moth species Catocala conjuncta, previously unrecorded in Britain, {{was found on the}} reserve. To acknowledge its place of capture it was given the common name Minsmere crimson underwing.|$|E

50|$|Migrants {{arrive in}} Great Britain most years during summer and autumn, but numbers are usually very low. There is no {{evidence}} that the species breeds in Britain; it is thought that mild, wet winters prevent them from surviving there for very long. The 'Butterfly Farmer' L. Hugh Newman raised thousands for release at his 'farm' in Bexley, but none were seen the following spring. Specimens stored in his refrigerator for the winter survived however. In a book he said that <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty</b> catches in England were suspiciously concentrated around London, Hull and Harwich, all these being ports in the timber trade with Scandinavia, and theorized that they had hibernated in stacks of timber which was then shipped to England, and had not traveled naturally.|$|E
50|$|Brown hares and European otters {{are found}} {{all along the}} north Norfolk coast, but red {{squirrels}} disappeared from the Holkham pines by 1981. The rare natterjack toad breeds at Holkham, {{one of only two}} sites along this coast, although the common frog, common toad and common lizard are widespread in appropriate habitats.The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and ghost moth are sometimes seen in the woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a clouded yellow or <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty</b> may also occur in some years.

5000|$|Another famous {{writer who}} lived in the area was the poet Robert Browning, who was born in Walworth (then in the parish of Camberwell), and lived there until he was 28. Novelist George Gissing, in the summer of 1893, took lodgings at 76 Burton Road, Brixton. From Burton Road he went for long walks through nearby Camberwell, soaking up {{impressions}} of the way of life he saw emerging there." [...] This led him to writing In the Year of Jubilee, the story of [...] "the romantic and sexual initiation of a suburban heroine, Nancy Lord." [...] Gissing originally called his novel Miss Lord of Camberwell. Muriel Spark, the author of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie and The Ballad of Peckham Rye lived, between 1955 and 1965 s in a bedsit at 13 Baldwin Crescent, Camberwell. The novelist Mary Jane Staples, who grew up in Walworth, wrote a book called The King of Camberwell, the third instalment of her Adams family saga about Cockney life. Comedian Jenny Eclair is a long term resident of Camberwell, and the area features in her 2001 novel <b>Camberwell</b> <b>Beauty,</b> named after a species of butterfly. Playwright Martin McDonagh and his brother, writer/director John Michael McDonagh, live in Camberwell.|$|E

5000|$|Although he {{published}} poetry, Urzidil {{is best known}} for his prose which, though written in exile, reflects his Bohemian heritage just as well as his new American environment. Among his more notable works are the story Der Trauermantel (1945, Trauermantel is the German name of the <b>Camberwell</b> <b>beauty)</b> about Adalbert Stifter′s youth, and his collections of short stories like [...] (1956; the title refers as well to Prague which he had to leave behind when the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia as to his first love), Prague Triptych (1960, whose composition is derived from that of an altarpiece), or Kidnapping and Seven Other Incidents (1964, whose eight stories are situated in the USA). Urzidil's only novel The Great Hallelujah (1959) shows as literary collage in the tradition of John Dos Passos, Thomas Wolfe, and Alfred Döblin a manifold panorama of the United States as he experienced them since his arrival in 1941. He wrote also books and essays about cultural history, e. g. The Fortune of Presence. Goethe's View of America (1958), America and the Ancient World (1964), and There Goes Kafka (1965, enlarged 1966), or monographs about artists and poets he admired, such as Hollar, a Czech émigré in England (1942, revised and abridged translation of his German book Wenceslaus Hollar - the Engraver of the Baroque Era, 1936), or his opus magnum in this genre Goethe in Bohemia (1932, revised and enlarged 1962 and 1965). More over Urzidil translated texts and books from Czech and English into German; worth mentioning is especially his translation (1955) of By Avon River (1949) by the American poet H.D., the companion of Urzidil's life-saver Bryher.|$|E
