5000|$|The <b>classification</b> <b>standards</b> help {{assure that}} the Federal {{personnel}} management program runs soundly because agencies are now becoming more decentralized and now have more authority to classify positions. Agencies are required to classify positions according to the criteria and the guidance that OPM has issued.

The occupations in federal agencies may change over time, but the duties, responsibilities, and qualifications remain the same so careful application of appropriate <b>classification</b> of the <b>standards</b> needs {{to be related to the}} kind of work for the position. When classifying a position the first decision to be made is the pay system.
