25|$|Voluntary liquidations {{occur when}} the company's members decide voluntarily to wind up {{the affairs of the}} company.

Despite Peugeot's sportscar racing program, the <b>company</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> prepared to build a pure sportscar any more hardcore than the RC Z sports-coupe. It is also pursuing government funding to develop a diesel-hybrid drivetrain, which might be key to its expansion.|$|E

25|$|Level 1 shares {{can only}} be traded on the OTC market and the company has minimal {{reporting}} requirements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

25|$|In 2001, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation {{filed for}} bankruptcy. In 2003, {{the company was}} {{dissolved}} and its assets, including its six massive plants, were acquired by the International Steel Group; the Bethlehem Steel Corporation did not merge with/into International Steel Group. International Steel Group was acquired by Mittal Steel in 2005, which merged with Arcelor to become ArcelorMittal in 2006. Since the Bethlehem Steel Corporation was dissolved instead of being merged into International Steel Group, the former <b>company</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> part of the former International Steel Group heritage, the former Mittal Steel's heritage and the current ArcelorMittal's heritage.|$|E
25|$|Unsponsored shares {{trade on}} the {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) market. These shares are issued in accordance with market demand, and the foreign company has no formal agreement with a depositary bank. Unsponsored ADRs are often issued {{by more than one}} depositary bank. Each depositary services only the ADRs it has issued. Since the <b>company</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> formally involved in an unsponsored issue, the motivation of the company to list overseas is irrelevant for unsponsored programs. Instead, the dynamics of this market is determined by the incentive structure of three types of players: holders of the securities on-shore, the investors in depository receipts off-shore and the intermediaries (depository banks and exchanges).|$|E

In accordance with this offering, the company is required to file a Form F-1, which is the format for a prospectus for the shares. They also must file a Form 20-F annually and must adhere to U.S. GAAP standards or IFRS as published by the IASB.

25|$|UCC {{chairman}} and CEO Warren Anderson {{was arrested and}} released on bail by the Madhya Pradesh Police in Bhopal on 7 December 1984. Anderson was taken to UCC's house after which he was released six hours later on $2,100 bail and flown out on a government plane. These actions were allegedly taken {{under the direction of}} then chief secretary of the state, who was possibly instructed from chief minister's office, who himself flew out of Bhopal immediately. Later in 1987, the Indian government summoned Anderson, eight other executives and two company affiliates with homicide charges to appear in Indian court. In response, Union Carbide said the <b>company</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> under Indian jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Under CRTC rules, cable {{companies}} cannot offer a new American service if a comparable Canadian service already exists. However, if a Canadian equivalent begins operations after an American service {{has already been}} added to cable packages, the cable <b>company</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> required to discontinue the American service. (For example, Canadian {{cable companies}} cannot offer MTV, as the station was not yet available in Canada when MuchMusic began broadcasting in 1984. However, cable companies can offer CNN, as they were already offering that service when CBC Newsworld first aired in 1989.) The rules formerly required that the American service be removed if a Canadian equivalent is launched; this caused controversy when the US version of CMT {{was removed from the}} lineup when a new Canadian country music channel called the New Country Network launched. CMT had contested that this was a violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Ultimately, Viacom purchased a minority share in the network, and rebranded it under the CMT name.|$|E

The Cocoa Life Program invests $400m in its cocoa supply chain over the next ten years. Approximately $100m of the money will be spent for the cocoa supply chain in Ivory Coast.
