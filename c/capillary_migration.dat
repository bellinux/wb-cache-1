Mast cells are also found in increased numbers in other pathologic states associated with angiogenesis, such as psoriasis (5, 6), chronic inflammation (7, 8), and immune rejection (9, 10).

40|$|In this thesis, I {{focus on}} {{studying}} interaction between colloidal particles and lipid bilayers. Inspired by proteins that generate membrane curvature, sense the underlying membrane geometry, and migrate driven by curvature gradients, we explore the question: Can colloids, adhered to lipid bilayers, also sense {{and respond to}} membrane geometry?^ In {{the first part of}} the thesis, I report experimental results of homogeneous nanoparticles and microparticles on lipid bilayers. Charged nanoparticles were used to study the dependence on tension of particle wrapping by bilayer membranes. The particle wrapping process is a competition between adhesion energy on the particle/lipid interface, and the energy cost to deform the membrane. I found that when membrane tension was below 0. 27 mN/m, the apparent area of an aspirated giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) decreased during nanoparticles binding, likely due to wrapping of particles by the membrane. This area decrease was eliminated by increasing the membrane tension. I also report results on pair interactions between streptavidin-coated microparticles bound to biotinylated GUVs. A preferred separation distance was found between pairs of particles, and an interaction potential energy on the order of thermal fluctuations was found. ^ To control the degree of wrapping systematically, I used Janus microparticles with two different surface properties on each of the hemisphere. I report the migration of Janus microparticles adhered to giant unilamellar vesicles elongated to present spatially varying principal curvatures. In experiments, colloids migrated on these vesicles toward sites of high deviatoric curvature. This migration occurred only when the membranes were tense, suggesting that they migrate to minimize membrane area. By determining the energy dissipated along a trajectory, the energy field was inferred to depend linearly on the local deviatoric curvature, like curvature driven <b>capillary</b> <b>migration</b> on interfaces between immiscible fluids. In this latter system, energy gradients were larger, so colloids move deterministically, whereas the paths traced by colloids on vesicles had significant fluctuations. By addressing the role of Brownian motion, I show that the observed migration is analogous to curvature driven <b>capillary</b> <b>migration,</b> with membrane tension playing the role of interfacial tension. Since this motion is mediated by membrane shape, it can be turned on and off by dynamically deforming the vesicle. While particle-particle interactions on lipid membranes have been considered in many contributions, I report here an exciting and previously unexplored modality to actively direct the migration of colloids to desired locations on lipid bilayers. ...|$|E

The results of <b>capillary</b> <b>migration</b> of spleen cells in high tumor cell dose inoculated mice show appearance of cellular immune response {{in the early stages}} of the tumor growth. As the tumor progresses, the cellular response declines and rapidly disappears, culminating in stimulation values near the time of the death of these mice.

40|$|Angiogenesis- {{the growth}} of new {{capillaries}} from existing vessels- is required for tumor growth; however, tumor vessels exhibit abnormal structure and function, which impairs the targeted delivery of anti-cancer agents. While directional <b>migration</b> of <b>capillary</b> endothelial cells is critical for normal angiogenesis, the mechanism by which oriented <b>capillary</b> cell <b>migration</b> is controlled or how it is deregulated during tumorigenesis is unknown. Recently our lab reported that the focal adhesion protein, paxillin, is required for directional migration of fibroblasts. Endothelial cells also express paxillin and localize it in their focal adhesions. Thus, I set out to analyze whether paxillin influences directional migration of endothelial cells. When the expression of paxillin is knocked down in endothelial cells, this enhances their migration but decreases their directional persistence in vitro and in vivo in migration, angiogenesis and developmental assays. Having confirmed that paxillin plays {{a central role in}} controlling oriented <b>capillary</b> cell <b>migration,</b> I then studied the mechanism by which it contributes to normal microvessel network formation and tumor angiogenesis. I found that paxillin knockdown increases microvessel density but causes loss of sprout orientation. These characteristics resemble those of tumor vasculature, and, in fact, studies revealed that tumors inhibit paxillin expression in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo by secreting soluble factors, such as the potent angiogenic factor VEGF. Mechanistically, paxillin knockdown decreases expression of the VEGF receptor neuropilin 2 (NRP 2) but not VEGF receptor 2, and this is mediated by the transcription factor GATA 2. Direct knockdown of NRP 2 also increases endothelial cell migration and vessel density in vitro and in vivo and these effects are rescued by over expressing paxillin. In summary, these studies have led to the discovery of a new mechanism for control of directional endothelial cell migration during angiogenesis that is mediated by paxillin-NRP 2 signaling. Importantly, this previously unknown mechanism is deregulated in tumor angiogenesis, which may contribute to the enhanced, disorganized microvasculature that is hallmark of cancer. These findings also revealed a new function for the focal adhesion protein, paxillin, as a mediator of tumor angiogenesis, and elucidated a novel mechanism for control of the expression of NRP 2. by Alexandra Elisa German.

This supernatant factor, unlike other neutrophil agonists, promotes dispersive locomotion of neutrophils at uniform concentration, lowers their adhesion to endothelial cells, inhibits their chemotactic response to fMLP and induces distinctive morphological changes.

In vitro, thymosin beta 4 sulfoxide inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis, and in vivo, the oxidized peptide, but not the native form, was a potent inhibitor of carrageenin-induced edema in the mouse paw. Thymosin beta 4 is unique, because oxidation attenuates its intracellular G-actin sequestering activity, but greatly enhances its extracellular signaling properties.

The environment where cells moved was built of by two different chambers, containing respectively melanoma cells and splenocytes, connected by <b>capillary</b> <b>migration</b> channels allowing leucocytes to migrate from their chamber toward the melanoma one. We collected and analyzed data on the motility of the cells {{and found that the}} first ensemble of IRF- 8 KO cells performed pure uncorrelated random walks, while WT splenocytes were able to make singular drifted random walks, that, averaged over the ensemble of cells, collapsed on a straight ballistic motion for the system as a whole. At a finer level of investigation, we found that IRF- 8 KO splenocytes moved rather uniformly since their step lengths were exponentially distributed, while WT counterpart displayed a qualitatively broader motion as their step lengths along the direction of the melanoma were log-normally distributed...|$|E
40|$|Utilizing the {{in vitro}} <b>capillary</b> <b>migration</b> {{inhibition}} (MI) technique, the cell-mediated immune response to sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) {{has been studied}} in the lizard, Calotes versicolor. The viability of spleen cells in culture was above 85 %, irrespective of {{the presence or absence}} of antigen. Both plaque-forming cell (PFC) and MI responses were found to be antigen-specific. Heat-labile serum factors did not seem to have a role in the MI phenomenon. Both cellular and sonicated membrane preparations of SRBC induced a similar pattern and degree of MI of sensitized spleen cells. Migration of spleen cells was observed within 1 h of the initiation of cultures. The maximum difference between control and experimental cultures occurred by 12 h of incubation. There was an insignificant escape from inhibition after 24 h of culture. Administration of 6 × 108 SRBC via the intramuscular route favoured both PFC and MI responses. Although the PFC generation was favoured, only a low level of MI was induced by the intraperitoneal and intracardiac injections. MI and PFC responses are inversely related to the amount of antigen injected. Administration of 104 SRBC resulted in a high degree of MI without the production of PFC. On the other hand, 6 × 108 SRBC produced an abundant PFC response with a lesser degree of MI. Incorporation of SRBC into Freund's complete adjuvant resulted in the production of MI response with a concurrent reduction in the number of PFC. Formalized SRBC generated a good MI response without the induction of PFC. Sonicated SRBC induced both PFC and MI responses. MI was shown to be mediated by sensitized lymphoid cells. As few as 5 % sensitized spleen cells were enough to bring about significant MI of unsensitized spleen cells. Thus, MI has been shown to be an in vitro manifestation of CMI to SRBC in the lizard...|$|E
40|$|Northern Chile, which {{includes}} the extremely arid Atacama Desert and the semiarid Andean Highlands, has more than 100 basins with interior drainage; most contain salars (salt-ilncrusted playas). The area of interior drainage totals more than 38, 000 square miles, within which salara and clay playas extend over a total area of about 2, 800 square miles. In addition, hills and valleys in the Atacama Desert are extensively covered either with a thin hard saline crust, chiefly salt-cemented soil, or with a powdery soil that has a high content of saline material, chiefly anhydrite and gypsum. The region has an exceptional variety of types of hard saline crusts that are generally rare in other deserts, and many morphological and structural salt features, {{some of which may}} be unique. Soft saline crusts and clay playas, more characteristic of arid regions elsewhere, are also present. Hard salar crusts have formed by deposition of saline material in open water or by <b>capillary</b> <b>migration</b> and evaporation of near-surface ground water. Such crusts generally range from a few inches to several feet in thickness. Locally, crusts may attain thicknesses of several tens of feet, and one salar, Salar Grande, is a basin filled with high. purity rock salt to a local depth of at least 560 feet. Six general types of hard salar crusts are distinguished: (1) layered massive rock salt with a rugged surface, (2) slabby or nodular silty rock salt, (3) rugged gypsum or anhydrite, (4) massive coarsely crystalline rock salt, (5) smooth rock salt, and (6) silty nitrate-bearing saline crust. Soft surfaces or crusts include moist gypsum-bearing crusts, which commonly contain nodules and layers of ulexite in Andean salars, and moist to dry puffy soils and crusts that contain gypsum, thenardite and mirabilite as the principal saline constituents. An unusual chemical feature of the salars and the desert soils of northern Chile is the general paucity of carbonate minerals (for example, trona, calcite, and aragonite) which are widespread in other desert regions. Among the many morphological and structural features that can be recognized in and near salars of northern Chile, the most unusual occur in hard rock-salt crusts, which in themselves are scarce in other arid regions. Included are features due to corrosion of rock-salt crusts by windblown water or free-flowing surface water, such as: (1) salt cusps and crenulate margins of salars, (2) salt channels, (3) salt pseudobarchans, and (4) salt tubes. Constructional features in the salars include: (1) gypsum buttresses at borders of saline ponds, (2) salt veins, (3) salt stalactites, and (4) salt cones. In some salars, new fresh-water springs have formed steep-walled brine pools in thick rock-salt crusts. Prominent salt cascades and constructional salt terraces have been built up in one Andean valley by springs that are fed by brine from a nearby salar (Salar de Pedernales). Sag basins and prominent scarps occur along faults that cut through the salt mass of Salar Grande. Of, the 67 closed basins in the Andean Highlands of northern Chile, at least 35 show shorelines or deltas of former perennial lakes. Today only flve perennial lakes occur in this area. The former lakes probably formed at one or more times during the Pleistocene and perhaps continued to form into Holocene time. They indicate a climate that was either more rainy or cooler, or both, during the time of their formation. However, the absence of glacial features throughout most of the northern Chilean Andes indicates that the climate during the Pleistocene glacial stages was not greatly different from today's climate. It is estimated that perennial lakes would form in nearly all thil Andean basins if the mean annual rainfall of the region above 10, 000 feet in altitude were increased to 15 inches from its present 8 inches, and if the mean annual temperature were about 2 ° F. less than it is at present...|$|E
40|$|Angiogenesis is {{the process}} of new <b>capillary</b> {{formation}} by <b>migration</b> and proliferation of differentiated endothelial cells from pre-existing microvascular network. A number of angiogenic molecules and cell populations are involved in this complex of new vessel formation cascades resulting in the determination and organization of new tridimensional vascular network. The goal of therapeutic angiogenesis is to stimulate angiogenesis to improve perfusion, to deliver survival factors to sites of tissue repair, to mobilize regenerative stem cell populations, and ultimately to restore form and function to the tissue. Growth factors and bone marrow as a source of bone marrow mononuclear cells represent a very interesting research fi eld for the realization of therapeutic angiogenesis in ischemic tissues. They provide a potential key component in the healing processes of ischemic injured tissues. </p...|$|R
40|$|When lymphocyte-macrophage {{suspensions}} from sensitized {{animals are}} preincubated with specific antigen for 24 or more h, the following results are observed. (i) In a standard <b>capillary</b> macrophage <b>migration</b> test, there is complete inhibition of migration. (ii) When the preincubated cell suspension is mixed in varying proportions {{with a similar}} suspension from nonsensitized animals and a macrophage migration test is performed, there is no linear relationship between the degree of inhibition of migration {{and the proportion of}} sensitized lymphocytes initially present. Inhibition thus appears to be an “all-or-none” effect. (iii) In spite of the second observation, increasing periods of preincubation with antigen result in increasing inhibition. (iv) These results suggest the existence of a complex amplifying mechanism operating within the early period of exposure to antigen. (v) To test the possibility that cell proliferation contributes to this amplification, cells from sensitized guinea pigs were irradiated with a dose of 1, 000 rads prior to preincubation with antigen. Despite this dose, which virtually abolishes cell division in other systems, no diminution whatever in the amplification of inhibition was observed. These results suggest the existence of an early phase of increased production of migratory inhibition factor that is not dependent on cell division but that may be related to “recruitment” of nonsensitized lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|Eight tests {{investigating}} {{the function of}} circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes were performed in 68 subjects, half of whom smoked at least 20 cigarettes per day. Comparison {{of the two groups}} allowed determination of the in vivo effect of tobacco smoke on the nonspecific defense system of the body. Ingestion ability, oxygen consumption, and bactericidal activity were normal in smokers. Myeloperoxidase and neutrophil alkaline phosphatase activities also were unchanged. The nitroblue tetrazolium reduction and the serum lysozyme levels were slightly increased in smokers. The <b>capillary</b> tube random <b>migration,</b> though, was depressed, and intensive smoking further aggravated this change. It is suggested that tobacco smoke acts directly on one (or several) unidentified target site of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This impairment, demonstrated in vivo, probably plays a role in the genesis of the bronchopulmonary diseases so frequent in heavy smokers...|$|R
