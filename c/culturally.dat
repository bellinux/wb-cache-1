5|$|Bridging the {{gap between}} self-expressive {{piercing}} and spiritual piercing, modern primitives use piercing {{and other forms of}} body modification as a way of ritually reconnecting with themselves and society, which according to Musafar once used piercing as a <b>culturally</b> binding ritual. But {{at the same time that}} piercing can be <b>culturally</b> binding, it may also be a means of rebellion, particularly for adolescents in Western cultures.|$|E
5|$|Tulsa has a {{rich and}} diverse {{religious}} history, with notable and <b>culturally</b> significant communities of Christians, Jews, Muslims and others.|$|E
5|$|As <b>culturally</b> and religiously {{tolerant}} as the Parthians were, {{they adopted}} Greek as their official language, while Aramaic remained the lingua franca in the empire. The native Parthian language, Middle Persian, and Akkadian were also used.|$|E
5|$|<b>Culturally</b> {{inappropriate}} decision making: The Organisation is {{not designed}} to deal with cultural issues or complex social problems; the normal Indigenous decision-making processes and protocols such as consultation and input from family groupings are not structurally accommodated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Culturally</b> speaking, post-Civil War Massachusetts {{ceased to}} be a {{national}} center of idealistic reform movements (such as evangelicalism, temperance and antislavery) as it had been before the war. Growing industrialism, partly spurred on by the war, created a new culture of competition and materialism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Culturally,</b> the {{campaign}} captured the public imagination in Britain and France: the Battle of Grand Port {{is the only}} naval battle that appears on the Arc de Triomphe, while in Britain Rowley and Bertie were both made baronets for their services in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Boston flourished <b>culturally,</b> as well, {{admired for}} its {{rarefied}} literary life and generous artistic patronage, {{with members of}} old Boston families—eventually dubbed Boston Brahmins—coming {{to be regarded as}} the nation's social and cultural elites.|$|E
5|$|Numerous other <b>culturally</b> {{significant}} and archæologically notable sites are known across the territory, including shelters, rock art sites, stone artefact scatters, scarred trees and chert quarries. Tidbinbilla Mountain {{is believed to}} have long been used for Aboriginal initiation ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Reception of the {{proposal}} has been highly polarized; it has received high praise from some as a <b>culturally</b> significant icon that will symbolize the nation's wealth and power, while others question its socioeconomic motives, and forecast {{that it will have}} negative financial consequences.|$|E
5|$|Recordings {{selected}} for the National Recording Registry {{are those that are}} <b>culturally,</b> historically or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Spain and {{subsequently}} Mexico controlled {{much of what}} is now the western United States until the Mexican–American War, including the entire state of Texas. After Texas joined the United States, the native Tejanos living in the state began <b>culturally</b> developing separately from their neighbors to the south, and remained <b>culturally</b> distinct from other Texans. Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional Mexican forms such as mariachi and the corrido, and Continental European styles introduced by German and Czech settlers in the late 19th century. In particular, the accordion was adopted by Tejano folk musicians around the start of the 20th century, and it became a popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|This {{district}} {{saw many}} {{cultural and religious}} movements in history. The Visva Bharati University at Santiniketan, established by Rabindranath Tagore, {{is one of the}} places Birbhum is internationally renowned for. Many festivals are celebrated in this <b>culturally</b> rich district, including the notable Poush Mela.|$|E
5|$|Although Sri Lankan Tamils are <b>culturally</b> and linguistically distinct, genetic studies {{indicate}} that they {{are closely related to}} other ethnic groups in the island while being related to the Indian Tamils from South India as well. There are various studies that indicate varying degrees of connections between Sri Lankan Tamils, Sinhalese and Indian ethnic groups.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} shrine of {{religious}} Christian Armenians worldwide, Etchmiadzin {{has been an}} important location in Armenia not only religiously, but also politically and <b>culturally.</b> A major pilgrimage site, {{it is one of the}} most visited places in the country. Along with several important early medieval churches located nearby, the cathedral was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Aside from these, since Constantinople was a prime trading {{center in}} the Mediterranean region and beyond, {{virtually}} every known language of the Middle Ages was spoken in the Empire at some time, even Chinese. As the Empire entered its final decline, the Empire's citizens became more <b>culturally</b> homogeneous and the Greek language became integral to their identity and religion.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its natural}} resources, Sarawak specialises in {{the export of}} oil and gas, timber and oil palms, but also {{possesses}} strong manufacturing, energy and tourism sectors. It is ethnically, <b>culturally,</b> and linguistically diverse; major ethnic groups including Iban, Malay, Chinese, Melanau, Bidayuh and Orang Ulu. English and Malay are the two official languages of the state; there is no official religion.|$|E
5|$|Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and {{association}} with human settlements, the house sparrow is <b>culturally</b> prominent. It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, {{as well as}} being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. Though it is widespread and abundant, its numbers have declined in some areas. The animal's conservation status is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Bikini waxing is the {{epilation}} of {{pubic hair}} beyond the bikini line {{by use of}} waxing. The bikini line delineates {{the part of a}} woman's pubic area to be covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit. Visible pubic hair is widely <b>culturally</b> disapproved, considered to be embarrassing, and often removed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Culturally</b> the Antankarana {{have many}} {{similarities}} with the neighboring Sakalava. They practice tromba (ancestral spirit possession) {{and believe in}} nature spirits. They adhere {{to a wide range}} of fady (ancestral taboos), particularly including several that serve to protect wildlife and wilderness areas. The traditional economy of the Antankarana revolved around fishing and livestock, although more recently they have adopted farming; many are salary earners working in civil administration, teaching, trade and other areas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Culturally,</b> the wall's {{symbolic}} {{role as a}} {{line between}} civilized society and barbarism was suppressed by the Qing, who were keen to weaken the Han culturalism that had been propagated by the Ming. As a result, no special {{attention was paid to}} the Great Wall until the mid-Qing dynasty, when Westerners started to show interest in the structure.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{formerly}} being working class, Summer Hill {{and many}} of the surrounding suburbs have gradually undergone gentrification over recent years. <b>Culturally,</b> Summer Hill is a blend of medium-density European Sydney suburbia, with Italian influences (which are most evident in Leichhardt to the east and Haberfield to the north), Asian (mainly Chinese) influences (which are most strongly evident in Ashfield to the West), and smaller influences from many other cultures.|$|E
5|$|During 2006, {{the state}} {{government}} supplied $150,000 for new gates and ticket boxes at the stadium entry. The gates were later named after recently deceased Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon. These gates, and the heritage-listed Northern Stand, have {{been placed on the}} Tasmanian Heritage Register as <b>culturally</b> significant to the state. The two-storey Cameron-Tyson stand was in 2005, replaced by an extension of the Gunns Stand.|$|E
5|$|During the 1830s and 1840s, other faith {{groups also}} came to St. Louis, {{including}} the first Jewish congregation in the area, the United Hebrew Congregation, which was organized in 1837. Followers of Mormonism arrived in 1831, and in 1854, they organized the first LDS church in St. Louis. Despite these events, during the pre-Civil War era most of the population were <b>culturally</b> Catholic or uninterested in organized religion.|$|E
5|$|Florida Atlantic University {{has long}} ranked {{as the most}} racially, ethnically and <b>culturally</b> diverse {{institution}} in Florida's State University System.

Florida Atlantic University students come from all 50 states, every county in Florida, and more than 180 countries. Enrichment opportunities include internships, hands-on research, study abroad experiences, and 310 clubs and campus organizations.|$|E
5|$|Gaza was <b>culturally</b> {{dominated}} by neighboring Egypt {{from the early}} 19th century; Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered it and most of Palestine in 1832. Strangely, in 1833, Muhammad Ali instructed his son Ibrahim Pasha not to purchase Gaza's cotton harvest (cotton production was Ali's main source of wealth and Egypt's production was low that year), instead allowing its residents to dispose of it how they wished.|$|E
5|$|Gunther Erich Rothenberg {{was born}} in Berlin. His family was a <b>culturally</b> assimilated German Jewish family. In 1937, Rothenberg moved to the Netherlands with his mother; his father later joined them. The family moved next to Britain, where Rothenberg had some schooling. In 1939, he moved to Mandatory Palestine, then under British rule. There he joined the Zionist {{movement}} and Hashomer Hatzair (The Youth Guard), a Socialist-Zionist youth movement. He retained his passion for a Jewish homeland throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg's stages are not <b>culturally</b> neutral, as {{demonstrated}} by its application {{to a number of}} different cultures. Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates. Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Epistles have {{remained}} <b>culturally</b> significant in Scandinavia, especially in Sweden. They are widely sung and recorded: by choirs {{such as the}} Orphei Drängar, by professional solo singers such as Fred Åkerström and Cornelis Vreeswijk, and by ensemble singers such as Sven-Bertil Taube and William Clauson. The Epistles have been translated into German, French, English, Russian, Polish, Finnish, Italian and Dutch.|$|E
5|$|That the {{cultural}} {{representations of the}} Eastern world that Orientalism purveys are intellectually suspect, and cannot be accepted as faithful, true, and accurate representations of the peoples and things of the Orient; {{that the history of}} European colonial rule and political domination of Asian civilizations, distorts the writing of even the most knowledgeable, well-meaning, and <b>culturally</b> sympathetic Orientalist.|$|E
5|$|The National Museum of Somalia was {{established}} after independence in 1960, {{when the old}} Garesa Museum {{was turned into a}} National Museum. The National Museum was later moved in 1985, renamed to the Garesa Museum, and converted to a regional museum. After shutting down, the National Museum later reopened. As of January 2014, it holds many <b>culturally</b> important artefacts, including old coins, bartering tools, traditional artwork, ancient weaponry and pottery items.|$|E
5|$|The Song dynasty (960–1279 AD) was a <b>culturally</b> {{rich and}} {{sophisticated}} age for China. There was blossoming of and advancements {{in the visual}} arts, music, literature, and philosophy. Officials of the ruling bureaucracy, who underwent a strict and extensive examination process, reached new heights of education in Chinese society, while general Chinese culture was enhanced by widespread printing, growing literacy, and various arts.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is ranked}} #94 on Empire magazine's {{list of the}} 500 Greatest Films of All Time. In 1999, the U.S. National Film Registry {{selected}} it for preservation in the Library of Congress as <b>culturally,</b> historically, and aesthetically significant. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed The Wild Bunch as the 23rd best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.|$|E
5|$|The {{party was}} the only major Belgian party that opposed Belgium's {{membership}} of the European Union, {{as well as the}} idea of a federal Europe itself. It however defended a con-federal Europe based on sovereign <b>culturally</b> homogeneous nation-states. The European issue was however not an issue the party promoted much.|$|E
5|$|The prefecture-level city roughly {{corresponds}} to the basin of the Lhasa River, which {{is the center of}} Tibet politically, economically and <b>culturally.</b> Chengguan District is also the center of Tibet in terms of transport, communications, education and religion, as well as being the most developed part of Tibet and a major tourist destination with sights such as the Potala Palace, Jokhang and Ramoche Temple.|$|E
5|$|This {{brings the}} issue of the mysterious origin of the Wielbark culture, and why it so {{immediately}} replaced the Oksywie culture. According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes, the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia (under King Berig) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores, followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids. Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region, and then, some years later (under King Filimer, the fifth one counting from Berig), continued their migration toward the Black Sea. This story, in the past dismissed, is now seen as containing basic elements of the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic ancestors of the Goths indeed. The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region of <b>culturally</b> different (although related) people, who mixed with the Oksywie culture population, and being more advanced possibly dominated it (at least <b>culturally)</b> to some degree, is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the role}} {{is subject to}} many stereotypes, and men may have {{difficulties}} accessing parenting benefits, communities, and services targeted at mothers, it became more socially acceptable by the 2000s. The stay-at-home dad was more regularly portrayed in the media by the 2000s, especially in the United States. However, due to traditional family structures and stereotypic expectations, the stay at home father figure is <b>culturally</b> unacceptable in countries in South Asia such as India.|$|E
