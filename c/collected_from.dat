5|$|Mycena cinerella is a {{saprobic}} fungus, and derives nutrients by decomposing {{leaf litter}} and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic {{matter in the}} soil. The fruit bodies grow in groups on needles under pine and Douglas fir, typically {{in the late summer}} and autumn. In the United States, it has been <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> Michigan, Washington, Oregon, and California. In Europe, it has also been <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> the Great Britain, Norway, Poland, and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the mineral {{contents}} of various edible mushrooms found that C.micaceus contained the highest concentration of potassium in the 34species tested, close to half a gram of potassium per kilogram of mushroom. Because the species can bioaccumulate detrimental heavy metals like lead and cadmium, it has been advised to restrict consumption of specimens <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> roadsides or other collection sites that may be exposed to or contain pollutants.|$|E

5|$|Common {{over much}} of the Northern Hemisphere, S.coccinea occurs in the Midwest, in the valleys between the Pacific coast, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range. Its North American {{distribution}} extends north to various locations in Canada and south to the Mexican state Jalisco. The fungus has also been <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> Chile in South America. It is also found in the Old World—Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and India. Specimens <b>collected</b> <b>from</b> the Macaronesian islands that once thought to be S.coccinea were later determined to be the distinct species S.macaronesica. A 1995 study of the occurrence of British Sarcoscypha (including S.coccinea and S.austriaca) concluded that S.coccinea was becoming very rare in Great Britain. All species of Sarcoscypha, including S.coccinea, are Red-Listed in Europe. In Turkey, it is considered critically endangered.|$|E

5|$|Fruit bodies can {{bioaccumulate}} heavy metals, including toxic ones, from polluted soil.
