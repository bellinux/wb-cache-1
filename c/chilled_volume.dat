40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine the relationship between poultry <b>chilling</b> water <b>volume</b> and carcass microbiology. In the first study, the volume of water used during immersion chilling {{was found to have}} a significant effect on the counts of bacteria recov-ered from broiler carcass halves; however, these volumes (2. 1 and 16. 8 L/kg) were extreme and did not reflect commercial levels. A second study using commercial <b>chilling</b> <b>volumes</b> was conducted with 3. 3 L/kg (low) or 6. 7 L/kg (high) distilled water in the chiller. Prechill broiler carcasses were removed from a commercial processing line, cut into left and right halves, and one-half of each pair was individually chilled in a bag containing low or high volume of water. Bags containing halves were submersed in a secondary chill tank containing approxi-mately 150 L of an ice-water mix (0. 6 °C). After 45 min, halves were removed, allowed to drip for 5 min, and rinsed with 100 mL of sterile water for 1 min.

40|$|Extensive {{solidification}} simulations {{are conducted}} using {{finite difference method}} on an aluminium alloy casting. Orthogonal experimental array layout is considered for running experimental simulations. Microstructural parameter Secondary Dendrite Arm Spacing (SDAS) at three different locations was predicted as response variable, through solidification simulations by varying the process parameters. The input process variables are pouring temperature, insulation on riser and <b>chill</b> <b>volume</b> heat capacity. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was developed to predict the response variable for varied input process variables. Through sensitivity analysis the influence of input process variables on output response was obtained. The results obtained from solidification simulations and ANN model are validated experimentally...|$|R

40|$|Cryosorption {{vacuum system}} for COIL is {{researched}} and developed. Adsorption chiller {{has been proposed}} and developed by improving the heat exchanger chiller. Compared with the heat exchanger <b>chiller,</b> the <b>volume</b> and LN 2 consumption of the new chiller were favourably reduced. In the present work, the new adsorption operation process, cryogenic pressure swing adsorption is adopted. Compared with thermal swing adsorption, regeneration time is shortened and LN 2 consumption is saved by at least 80 % in the new operation process. The cryosorption vacuum system was integrated to COIL and tested successfully. The weight of sorbent in adsorption bed is 22 Kg, the total gas flowrate is about 0. 5 mol/s, the COIL’s power maintains over 2 kW, the total COIL’s working time accounts to 100 seconds. It is concluded that the cryosorption vacuum system has the same pressure recovery capability as the large vacuum tank. 维也纳理工大...|$|R
40|$|A {{microporous}} membrane is used {{in combination}} with rectangular microchannels in the absorber of an absorption chiller {{with the aim of}} reducing the size of this cooling technology. The simulation of the heat and mass transfer between the solution and the vapour phase in a H 2 O&-LiBr absorber using porous fibres is considered. Heat and mass transfer processes are modelled by means of selected correlations and data gathered from the open literature. This new model is applied for the simulation of the absorber under typical operating conditions of absorption cooling chillers. Absorption rate, heat and mass transfer coefficients, solution concentration, temperatures of the working fluids and pressure potential along the absorption channels are calculated. For the case considered in this study, the absorber channels are of 5 cm length, offering a maximum ratio between cooling capacity of the <b>chiller</b> and absorber <b>volume</b> of 1090 kW/m 3. This ratio is higher than twice the usual values found in falling film absorbers using conventional circular tubes. The mean absolute error between the model results and the experimental data gathered from the open literature is 8. 5 %, showing the capability of the model to predict the performance of membrane-based absorbers. The financial support of this study by the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad of Spain through the research grant ENE 2013 - 43131 -R is greatly appreciated...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposed a}} new methodology {{for determining the}} optimal operating strategies for a chilled water storage system under a Time-of-Use electricity rate structure. It {{is based on a}} new classification of operating strategies and an investigation of multiple search paths. Each operating strategy consists of a control strategy and the maximum number of chillers running during the off-peak and on-peak periods. For each month, the strategy with the lowest monthly billing cost and minimal water level higher than the setpoint is selected as the optimal operating strategy for the current month. A system model is built to simulate the tank water level {{at the end of each}} time step and the system total power during each time step. This model includes six sub-models. Specifically, the plant model is a forward model using a wire-to-water concept to simulate the plant total power. For the Thermal Energy Storage (TES) model, the tank state is described with total <b>chilled</b> water <b>volume</b> in the tank and its derivation is the tank charging or discharging flow rate. A regression model is adopted to simulate the loop supply and return temperature difference as well as the loop total flow rate demand. In the control strategy sub-model, except for three conventional control strategies and the operation without TES, a new control strategy is advanced to load the chiller optimally. The final results will be a table showing the monthly control strategy and maximal number of chillers staged on during the off-peak and on-peak periods, an approach which is easy for the operators to follow. Two project applications of this methodology are introduced in this dissertation. One is an existing TES system with state-of-the-art control and metering systems. The monthly optimal operating strategies are generated, which will achieve significant savings. The comparisons among different control strategies are also provided. The other application consists of multiple plants with little data. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the economic feasibility of designing a new chilled water storage tank and sharing it among four plants. This problem can be solved with a simplified system model, and an optimal tank size is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Mg 17 Al 12 {{compound}} is a hardening {{phase in}} AZ 91 D alloy. Moreover, {{the concentration of}} Al and Zn {{has been found to}} be closely related to the corrosion performance of the magnesium alloy. The aim of this work was to study the effect of cooling rate on distribution Of Mg 17 Al 12 compound and compositional inhomogeneity in an AZ 91 D magnesium sand-cast plate (200 x 140 x 20 mm(3)). A copper chill block, which was placed at the end of mold cavity, was used to increase the cooling rate during solidification. A sand-cast plate was also produced, where no chill block being mounted at the end of mold cavity. The "with chill block" plate showed a rapid increasing in cooling rate with respect to distance from riser, as compared to the "without chill block" plate where almost no cooling rate fluctuation occurred. The volume fraction of Mg 17 Al 12 (beta phase) in the "without chill block" plate was higher than that in "with chill block" plate. In the "without <b>chill</b> block" plate, <b>volume</b> fraction of Mg 17 Al 12 was about 13. 9 vol% (near the riser) to about 19. 3 vol% (close to the end of the plate). However, the "with chill block'' plate was solidified in a higher cooling rate, leading to low volume fraction of the beta phase (13. 4 vol%). Higher cooling rate also resulted in more severe compositional inhomogeneity in the sand-cast plate. The Al and Zn concentration in the "with chill block" plate showed a concave downward dependence against the distance to riser. Moreover, in the "with chill block" plate, concentrations of Al and Zn did not enrich at the position near chill face. Instead, the Al and Zn contents near the chill surface were well below the average value. This finding is in disagreement with previou...|$|R
