40|$|This paper {{considers}} a production model involving a manufacturer that uses two different technologies, the green {{technology and the}} standard technology. The green product produced by the green technology {{can be used as}} a substitute for the traditional product produced by the standard technology, but not vice versa. Three models are considered. The first model concerns with product substitution only and serves as a benchmark model for the next two models, the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance model and the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading model. The second model extends the product substitution model by imposing an upper limit on the total <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance for each firm. The third model extends the second model to cater for <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading. For the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance model, analytical result shows that the optimal production quantity of any product depends on both its total <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance <b>quota</b> and its unit <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> profit, and the effect of substitution improves the service level, the expected profit of the manufacturer, and the green of product mix. For the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading model, analytical result shows that whenever the production quantity of any product is optimal, the marginal profit of production (i. e. the additional profit obtained by producing an extra item) should be equal to the unit price of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading within the market. Moreover, the optimal policy of either model reduces the total amount of <b>carbon</b> <b>emission,</b> thus producing less pollution to the environment. Lastly, the optimal profits obtained by using the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> trading model are larger than the corresponding optimal profits obtained by using the <b>carbon</b> <b>emission</b> allowance model.

40|$|Efficient {{reduction}} of <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>emissions</b> requires coordination of international efforts. Approaches proposed include <b>carbon</b> taxes, <b>emission</b> <b>quotas,</b> and jointly implemented energy projects. To reduce emissions efficiently, requires equalizing the marginal costs of reduction between countries. The apparently large differentials between {{the costs of}} reducing emissions in industrial and developing countries, implies a great potential for lowering the costs of reducing emissions by focusing on projects in developing countries. Most proposals for joint implementation of energy projects emphasize installing more technically efficient capital equipment, to allow reductions in energy use for any given mix of input, and output. But such increases in efficiency {{are likely to have}} potentially important second-round impacts: 1) Lowering the relative effective price of specific energy products. 2) Lowering the price of energy relative to other inputs. 3) Lowering the price of energy-intensive products relative to other products. The author explores the consequences of these second-round impacts, and suggests ways to deal with them in practical joint-implementation projects. For example, the direct impact of reducing the effective price of a fuel is to increase consumption of that fuel. Generally, substitution effects also reduce the use of other fuels, and the emissions generated from them. If the fuel whose efficiency is being improved, is already the least emission-intensive, the combined impact of these price changes is less likely to be favorable, and may even increase emissions. In the example the author uses, increase in coal use efficiency was completely ineffective in reducing emissions, because it resulted in emission-intensive coal being substituted for less polluting oil and gas.
