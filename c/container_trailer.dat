Only two organizations {{are involved in this}} business and the monthly production was recorded as 100 to 125 trailers. Like other manufacturing industries, trailer industry also faces problems due to trailer failures and difficulties to improve the trade. Failures are mainly due to lack of design stage analysis of the product. The primary objective of my research project is to analyze trailer failure problems and suggest solutions to improve the trailer industry in Sri Lanka. The methodology of this research is a combination of research training programme, questionnaire based study and a finite element analysis of the trailer solid model. Research training programme was arranged in a leading manufacturing and servicing organization in Sri Lanka by the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Moratuwa. It was very useful to understand the trailer manufacturing concepts, designs, trailer failures and the general problems faced by the trailer industry. Questionnaires are produced to two different categories of industries such as Trailer manufacturers and Trailer users. Questionnaires for trailer manufacturers are oriented towards identifying the techniques used by manufacturers to control the failures especially in design stage and identifying their problems and limitations in manufacturing trailers. Questionnaires for trailer users are oriented towards identifying trailer failures. A finite element analysis was carried out to study the present design of a particular type of trailer to identify the efficiency in design and to present any solutions if needed. Further, there were several rounds of semi-structured interviews with technical specialists, designers, supervisors and welders who were involved in trailer manufacturing. By the combination of all the efforts, it is found that trailer failures are mainly due to the problems due to design, fabrication, materials and parts selection, human resource and trailer misuse.

40|$|Paper revised from {{original}} submittal. Rickett et al. 11 - 2236 1 Intermodal freight generates one of {{the highest}} sources of revenue among all traffic types transported by North American railroads. Intermodal trains, however, use equipment that is not aerodynamically efficient compared to other types of rolling stock, and typically operate at higher speeds, creating significant aerodynamic drag. This high resistance associated with the movement of intermodal trains results in significant annual operating expenses in the form of fuel expenditures. However, opportunities exist to reduce the aerodynamic drag through improved equipment design and loading practices. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is developing a machine vision system to evaluate intermodal train energy efficiency based on <b>container</b> and <b>trailer</b> loading arrangement, the gap lengths between them, and the type of rolling stock used. A prototype machine vision system has been installed at BNSF Railway’s Logistics Park Chicago facility to demonstrate the feasibility of the system. This machine vision system consists of a camera, computer, and machine vision algorithms. The algorithms separate the train from the background and detect the edges of the <b>containers</b> and <b>trailers</b> to identify an...|$|R

40|$|A {{high-power}} acoustic sensor, {{capable of}} detecting and tracking persons through steel walls of cargo <b>containers,</b> <b>trailer</b> truck bodies, and train cars, {{has been developed}} and demonstrated. The sensor {{is based on a}} new concept for narrowband mechanical-impact acoustic transmitters and matched resonant receivers. The lightweight, compact, and low-cost transmitters produce high-power acoustic pulses at one or more discrete frequencies with little input power. The energy for each pulse is accumulated over long times at low powers, like a mousetrap, and therefore can be operated with ordinary batteries and no power conditioning. A breadboard impact-transmitter and matched-receiver system that detected human motion through thick walls with only rudimentary signal processing is described, and results are presented. A conceptual design is presented of an acoustic through-the-wall sensor, costing about $ 10, 000 per unit and capable of remotely and non-intrusively scanning steel cargo containers for stowaways at a rate of two containers per minute. Advantages of acoustic through-the-wall sensors over radar are: Sound penetrates metal walls; and acoustic sensors are sensitive to small and slow motions, and so can detect stationary persons by breathing motion alone. Other attractive features include: high-resolution locating and tracking; portability; low cost; quick and easy preparation and deployment; and near-real-time data processing and display. These features provide a robust stand-alone through-the-wall surveillance capability or an excellent complement to a radar sensor. Comment: 15 pages, 12 figures, published in Proc. SPI...|$|R
