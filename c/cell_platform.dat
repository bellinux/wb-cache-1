The Company launched Jeopardy with Sony Pictures Entertainment on 220 syndicated TV stations using patent pending technology to precisely synchronize the fast paced game with the unfolding telecast for each separate syndicated station. In August 2009, after AirPlay failed to raise the marketing capital required to launch the service on a nationwide basis in the recession, all of the AirPlay intellectual property, including pending patents and software was acquired by WinView, Inc.|$|E
40|$|Video coding {{follows the}} trend of {{demanding}} higher performance every new generation, and therefore could utilize many-cores. A complete parallelization of H. 264, {{which is the most}} advanced video coding standard, was found to be difficult due to the complexity of the standard. In this paper a parallel implementation of a complete H. 264 decoder is presented. Our parallelization strategy exploits function-level as well as data-level parallelism. Function-level parallelism is used to pipeline the H. 264 decoding stages. Data-level parallelism is exploited within the two most time consuming stages, the entropy decoding stage and the macroblock decoding stage. The parallelization strategy has been implemented and optimized on three platforms with very different memory architectures, namely an 8 -core SMP, a 64 -core cc-NUMA, and an 18 -core <b>Cell</b> <b>platform.</b> Evaluations have been performed using 4 kx 2 k QHD sequences. On the SMP platform a maximum speedup of 4. 5 x is achieved. The SMP-implementation is reasonably performance portable as it achieves a speedup of 26. 6 x on the cc-NUMA system. However, to obtain the highest performance (speedup of 33. 4 x and throughput of 200 QHD frames per second), several cc-NUMA specific optimizations are necessary such as optimizing the page placement and statically assigning threads to cores. Finally, on the <b>Cell</b> <b>platform</b> a near ideal speedup of 16. 5 x is achieved by completely hiding the communication latency.

We study the basic characteristics of the model and evaluate our runtime’s performance, scalability, and efficiency for micro-benchmarks and complete applications. We show that the model is well suited for many applications that map well to the Cell architecture, and that the runtime sustains high performance on these applications. For other applications, we analyze runtime performance and describe why performance is less impressive.

This paper proposes a portable and automatic compiler-based approach to mapping such parallelism using machine learning.

They predict the number of threads and the scheduling policy for any given program using a model learnt off-line. By using low-cost profiling runs, they predict the mapping for a new unseen program across multiple input data sets. We evaluate our approach by selecting parallelism mapping configurations for OpenMP programs on two representative but different multi-core platforms (the Intel Xeon and the Cell processors). Performance of our technique is stable across programs and architectures. On average, it delivers above 96 % performance of the maximum available on both platforms.

40|$|Abstract—Multicore {{systems have}} not only become {{ubiquitous}} in the desktop and server worlds, but are also becoming the standard in the embedded space. Multicore offers programability and flexibility over traditional ASIC solutions. However, many {{of the advantages of}} switching to multicore hinge on the assumption that software development is simpler and less costly than hardware development. However, the design and development of correct, high-performance, multi-threaded programs is a difficult challenge for most programmers. Stream programming is one model that has wide applicability in the multimedia, signal processing, and networking domains. Streaming is convenient for developers because it separates the creation of actors, or functions that operate on packets of data, from the flow of data through the system. However, stream compilers are generally ineffective for embedded systems because they do not handle strict resource or timing constraints. Specifically, real-time deadlines and memory size limitations are not handled by conventional stream partitioning and scheduling techniques. This paper introduces the SPIR compiler that orchestrates the execution of streaming applications with strict memory and timing constraints. Software defined radio or SDR is chosen as the application space to illustrate the effectiveness of the compiler for mapping applications onto the IBM <b>Cell</b> <b>platform.</b> Keywords-Multicore; streaming applications; I...|$|E

Stabilometry was carried out using a commercial 4 load <b>cell</b> <b>platform.</b> Statistical analysis of between group differences was performed using one-way analysis of variance for parametric data and Kruskal-Wallis tests for non-parametric data.

Antero-posterior sway was found to be the most sensitive parameter, since it correlated with the ADAS-cog orientation subscale in AD patients, and also discriminated between aMCI and normal controls. Our study shows that impairment in balance is a feature not only of AD, but also of aMCI.

The performance of the integrated pneumatic micropumps and cells/agarose loading mechanism were experimentally evaluated. The results show that {{in all of the}} 15 pneumatic micropumps studied, the medium delivery mechanism was able to provide a uniform flow output at flow rates ranging from 3. 6 μl/h to 439. 0 μl/h, depending on the applied pulsation frequency of the micropumps. In addition, the cell/agarose (scaffold) loading mechanism was proven to be able to perform sample loading tasks precisely and accurately in all of the 15 microbioreactors investigated with adjustable loading volumes of 0. 22 μl, 0. 18 μl and 0. 14 μl at applied air pressures of 10 psi, 12 psi and 15 psi, respectively, in the microvalves. Furthermore, anti-cancer drug testing was successfully demonstrated using the proposed culture platform and fluorescent microscopic observation. As a whole, because of miniaturization, not only does this perfusion 3 -D <b>cell</b> culture <b>platform</b> provide a homogenous and steady cell culture environment, but it also reduces the need for human intervention.

In this study, the design of a high-throughput medium pumping mechanism was especially highlighted. A new serpentine-shaped pneumatic micropump was used to provide the required medium pumping mechanism. Pneumatic microchannels with a varied length and U-shape bending corners were designed to connect three rectangular pneumatic chambers such that one can fine-tune the pumping rate of the S-shape micropump by using the fluidic resistance. To achieve a high-throughput medium pumping function, a pneumatic tank was designed to simultaneously activate all of the 30 pneumatic micropumps with a uniform pumping rate. Results show that the pumping rates of the 30 integrated micropumps were statistically uniform with a flow rate ranging from 8. 5 to 185. 1 microl h(- 1), indicating the present multiple medium pumping mechanism is feasible for high-throughput medium delivery purposes. Furthermore, as a demonstration case study, 3 -D culture of oral cancer cell was successfully performed, showing that the cell viability remained as high as 95 % - 98 % during the 48 h cell culture.
