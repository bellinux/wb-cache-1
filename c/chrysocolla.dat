25|$|Turquoise {{is nearly}} always cryptocrystalline and massive and assumes no {{definite}} external shape. Crystals, {{even at the}} microscopic scale, are exceedingly rare. Typically the form is vein or fracture filling, nodular, or botryoidal in habit. Stalactite forms have been reported. Turquoise may also pseudomorphously replace feldspar, apatite, other minerals, or even fossils. Odontolite is fossil bone or ivory that has been traditionally {{thought to have been}} altered by turquoise or similar phosphate minerals such as the iron phosphate vivianite. Intergrowth with other secondary copper minerals such as <b>chrysocolla</b> is also common.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{imitation}} of turquoise encountered today is dyed howlite and magnesite, both white {{in their natural}} states, and the former also having natural (and convincing) black veining {{similar to that of}} turquoise. Dyed chalcedony, jasper, and marble is less common, and much less convincing. Other natural materials occasionally confused with or used in lieu of turquoise include: variscite and [...] faustite; <b>chrysocolla</b> (especially when impregnating quartz); lazulite; smithsonite; hemimorphite; wardite; and a fossil bone or tooth called odontolite or [...] "bone turquoise", coloured blue naturally by the mineral vivianite. While rarely encountered today, odontolite was once mined in large quantities‚Äîspecifically for its use as a substitute for turquoise‚Äîin southern France.|$|E

50|$|Tenorite {{occurs in}} the {{weathered}} or oxidized zone associated with deeper primary copper sulfide orebodies. Tenorite commonly occurs with <b>chrysocolla</b> and the copper carbonates, azurite and malachite. The dull grey-black color of tenorite contrasts sharply with the often intergrown blue <b>chrysocolla.</b> Cuprite, native copper and Fe-Mn oxides also occur in this environment.|$|E

5000|$|Malachite (green {{carbonate}} of copper), {{and other}} alkaline copper salts of green colour. Azurite, the blue congener of malachite, {{was known as}} armenion, as it was mined in Armenia. On heating, malachite decomposes to carbon dioxide and copper, the latter inducing the soldering effect. According to an older opinion, <b>chrysocolla</b> was borax, which {{had been found in}} ancient gold foundries and is still used for soldering gold. Aristoteles (De mirabilibus) mentions that the Chalcedonian island Demonesus has a mine of cyan (Œ∫œÖŒ±ŒΩœåœÉ) and <b>chrysocolla.</b> Theophrastus (De lapidibus) describes <b>chrysocolla</b> as a kind of [...] "false emerald" [...] found in gold and copper mines, used for soldering gold. Pliny (Historia Naturalis) and Celsus mention that <b>chrysocolla</b> is extracted along with gold, and is used as a pigment and medicament. Dioscorides (De materia medica) describes the purification of the ore and its use in healing wounds, also noting its poisonous effect.|$|E
