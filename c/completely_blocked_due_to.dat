40|$|We {{consider}} electrostatically coupled {{quantum dots}} in topological insulators, otherwise confined and gapped by a magnetic texture. By numerically solving the (2 [*]+[*] 1) Dirac equation for the wave packet dynamics, we extract the energy {{spectrum of the}} coupled dots {{as a function of}} bias-controlled coupling and an external perpendicular magnetic field. We show that the tunneling energy can be controlled to a large extent by the electrostatic barrier potential. Particularly interesting is the coupling via Klein tunneling through a resonant valence state of the barrier. The effective three-level system nicely maps to a model Hamiltonian, from which we extract the Klein coupling between the confined conduction and valence dots levels. For large enough magnetic fields Klein tunneling can be <b>completely</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the enhanced localization of the degenerate Landau levels formed in the quantum dots...|$|E
40|$|All {{tissues from}} biopsy or surgery origin are fixed and {{paraffin}} embedded as a routine procedure {{in the hospital}} departments of pathology. The traditional method of tissue preservation is the fixation in formalin, followed by paraffin embedding. In this way tissue's integrity is ensured also for future analyses, {{because there is no}} further chemical degradation of nucleic acids and proteins in tissues embedded in paraffin. After few sections for the histopathological examination the tissues are stored for decades in the hospital archives. Even if formalin fixation compromises the quality and integrity of nucleic acids, it has already been demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} recover and analyze DNA and RNA from these archive's tissues, even of autopsy origin. Protein analysis is on the contrary <b>completely</b> <b>blocked,</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the fact that formalin fixation creates covalent links between proteins and the only way to study protein expression is immunohistochemistry.

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) is a {{condition}} in which the blood supply to the myocardium is partially or <b>completely</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> plaque build-up in the artery wall. Myocardial SPECT imaging is a commonly used technique to assess the blood flow to the myocardium and the function of the heart. The interpretation of the images can be difficult and subjective. Several automatic myocardial SPECT quantification programs have been developed to standardize the interpretation and analysis of myocardial images. These programs are based on different mathematical models for determination of the heart shape and different normal databases for detection of abnormality, which may lead to disparity in the results given by these different programs. The aims of the work were to validate two automatic quantification programs, i. e. AutoQUANT and 4 D-MSPECT, concerning important parameters in the detection of CAD, such as extent, severity and semi-quantitative segment scores and to show that a combination of a patient-like digital phantom and the Monte Carlo technique is useful in simulating clinical patient images. Results: The development of a radioactive ink-based stack phantom was performed for accurate generation of SPECT images. The comparison between the images generated by the stack phantom and the corresponding Monte Carlo simulated images showed good agreement. Differences between the one-day and two-day protocols, as well as between the two quantification programs, were found. Interdependence between the measures of extent and severity were observed. The interdependence was identified as being due to the algorithm used by the quantification program in the assessment of extent and severity. A model was developed to account for this interdependence. The ability of myocardial SPECT to discriminate between transmural and subendocardial lesions was observed for the simulated cases, while in the clinical situations this difference is difficult to observe due to the interdependence of the extent and severity. Conclusions: The disparity between the two programs in assessing the same patient images was found. The combination of the NCAT digital phantom and the SIMIND program was found to be useful in simulating clinical myocardial SPECT study. This technique could be a promising tool since realistic patient studies can be performed in a controlled way and used as input in different automatic quantification programs for accurate comparative evaluations...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the role}} of microtubules in {{directing}} the transport of many intracellular organelles, we investigated whether intact microtubules were also required for transcytosis across epithelia. Using polarized MDCK cells expressing receptors for the Fc domain of IgG (FcRII-B 2) or polymeric immunoglobulin (pIg-R), we examined the involvement of microtubules in apical to basolateral and basolateral to apical transcytosis, respectively. While depolymerization of microtubules with nocodozole {{had no effect on}} apical to basolateral transcytosis via FcR, basolateral to apical transcytosis of dimeric IgA via pIg-R was almost <b>completely</b> <b>blocked.</b> Inhibition <b>due</b> <b>to</b> nocodozole was selective for basolateral to apical transcytosis, since neither endocytosis nor receptor recycling was significantly affected at either plasma membrane domain. As shown by confocal microscopy, the block in transcytosis was <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the inability of MDCK cells to translocate IgA-containing vesicles from the basolateral to the apical cytoplasm {{in the absence of an}} intact microtubule network. The nocodazole sensitive step could be partially by-passed, however, by allowing cells to internalize IgA at 17 degrees C prior to nocodazole treatment. Although incubation at 17 degrees C blocked release of IgA into the apical medium, it did not prevent translocation of IgA-containing vesicles to the apical cytoplasm. Thus, receptor-mediated transcytosis in opposite directions exhibits distinct requirements for microtubules, a feature which reflects the spatial organization of MDCK cells...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: There is an {{increasing}} demand for compact actuators capable of producing large deflections, large forces, and broad frequency bandwidths. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> their solid state nature, smart materials can enable novel actuator solutions that compete favorably with established technologies based on electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic motors. However, in all existing active materials, large force and broadband responses are obtained at small displacements and methods for transmitting very short transducer element motion to large deformations need to be developed. We present a new hybrid actuator which operates {{on the principle of}} rectification of magnetostrictive vibrations by means of magnetorheological (MR) flow control. Experiments and theoretical calculations are aimed at substantiating the feasibility of the hybrid actuator and establishing design criteria for the development of an effective MR valve. The experiments presented here demonstrate the ability of the valve <b>to</b> <b>completely</b> <b>block</b> the flow <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the combined action of a pressure differential and MR fluid activation. For characterization purposes, two variations of the main valve concept are considered, one with moving coils and the other with fixed coils. Actuation measurements conducted on the complete actuator show deflections of 6. 5 in. in response to fluid inputs produced with a hydraulic piston in combination with an applied quasistatic voltage of amplitude 5 V. A system-level model is presented which is developed by treating the system as an RLC equivalent electrical circuit with operation across electrical, mechanical, and fluid domains. Attributes and shortcomings of the model are discussed through comparison of model results with experimental data.

40|$|In 1487, King John the second, {{ordered the}} {{building}} of an aqueduct to supply with water the town of Setúbal, an harbour on the Atlantic, about 30 kms sout-east of Lisbon. It was the first great aqueduct built in Portugal since the Roman era, {{at the same time}} the country was starting the adventure of overseas discoveries. Included on a Franco-Portuguese investigation programme, researchers of the Universities of Évora and Paris 1 Pathéon-Sorbonne realized, on last years, archaeological and architectonic studies on this aqueduct. The aqueduct is approximately 3 kms long. The water comes from the hills northwest of the town where a gallery penetrates into the limestone through a karstic system. Partly in masonry and partly serpentine in the natural hollows, ventilated through wells, the gallery comes out of the earth and takes the shape of an aqueduct built on a wall, slopping, sometimes strongly, towards Setúbal. The course of the aqueduct runs on a pre existing landscape. It runs firstly through the countryside, and follows paths and ways through the tops of walls belonging to farms or quintas. Although well preserved on the countryside, the aqueduct was strongly damaged by the town developments towards north. Nevertheless, there are still remains enough that make possible to understand its original course. At the entrance of the historical centre of Setúbal the aqueduct stands over arcades. In the centre, canals and pipings directed the water towards fountains, some of them of a good architectural and artistic level. The written documentation shows how difficult the water supply was particularly regarding the short debit. According to the explanations, this was due in great part to the geology. Nowadays the source in the bottom of the gallery is dry, a phenomenon not surprising in a karstic environment. But the limestone had also another important inconvenience. Part of the tumble-down wall supporting the aqueduct showed a succession of superposed pipes <b>completely</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> calcareous spath (calcite). These inconveniences explain the successive maintenance and repairing works between the 16 th and the 19 th centuries. Setúbal is a precocious but significant case of the efforts made in countries with hot and dry summers in order to have water all the year through, in the end of Middle Age. Finnaly, as certain sections of the aqueduct are interesting in terms of tourist and pedagogic use, a model and main guidelines to a valorization program is presented.
