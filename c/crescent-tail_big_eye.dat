50|$|Ah-chai {{receives}} {{the news that}} Number 6 is dead. He tells Wai-chui that {{it was due to}} <b>Big</b> <b>Eye's</b> betrayal, and he can hardly trust anyone besides her. Chai and <b>Big</b> <b>Eye</b> get in the car to go to the meeting with other gang leaders. The driver, Chuan, purposely causes a flat tire and they pull over. Ah-chai questions <b>Big</b> <b>Eye</b> about how Yung's men knew about Number 6's assassination plot. He says that <b>Big</b> <b>Eye</b> must've betrayed Number 6 to Yung since Number 6 is very tight lipped and he would only tell Ah-chai or <b>Big</b> <b>Eye</b> of his plans. <b>Big</b> <b>Eye</b> admits to his betrayal and Ah-chai shoots him in the arm. <b>Big</b> <b>Eye</b> explains that Ah-chai growing soft over the years has doomed them all and he was only trying to save himself from the same fate. Ah-chai realizes <b>Big</b> <b>Eye</b> is right and spares him. <b>Big</b> <b>Eye</b> attempts {{to get out of the}} car and is killed by the driver Chuan with a knife. Chai looks despondently at <b>Big</b> <b>Eye</b> sprawled against the window as he is sad to see his old friend die, but then is dismayed to realize, as <b>Big</b> <b>Eye's</b> body slumps down against the car, that <b>Big</b> <b>Eye</b> had pulled a gun and wanted to kill him even after Chai forgave <b>Big</b> <b>Eye.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Big</b> <b>Eyes</b> is a 2014 American biographical film {{directed}} by Tim Burton, written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski and starring Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz. The film {{is about the}} life of American artist Margaret Keane—famous for drawing portraits and paintings with <b>big</b> <b>eyes.</b> It follows the story of Margaret and her husband, Walter Keane, who took credit for Margaret's phenomenally successful and popular paintings in the 1950s and 1960s. It follows the lawsuit (and trial) between Margaret and Walter, after Margaret reveals she is the real artist behind the <b>big</b> <b>eyes</b> paintings.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a review}} of the film <b>Big</b> <b>Eyes.</b> Adapted from a true story about artist Margaret Keane, the {{overarching}} theme of the movie is plagiarism. While most people think of written works such as books and articles being plagiarized, <b>Big</b> <b>Eyes</b> gives viewers insight into the world of stolen works of visual art, namely paintings. The victim finds moral courage through religion, while the thief (Keane’s husband,Walter) lives in denial until death. Anyone with an interest in art, law, or psychiatry will enjoy what <b>Big</b> <b>Eyes</b> has to offer...|$|R
