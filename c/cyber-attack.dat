40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{compromise}} a target control system successfully, hackers possibly attempt to launch multiple <b>cyber-attacks</b> aiming at multiple communication channels {{of the control}} system. However, the problem of detecting multiple <b>cyber-attacks</b> has been hardly investigated so far. Therefore, this paper deals with the detection of multiple stochastic <b>cyber-attacks</b> aiming at multiple communication channels of a control system. Our goal is to design a detector for the control system under multiple <b>cyber-attacks.</b> Based on frequency-domain transformation technique and auxiliary detection tools, an algebraic detection approach is proposed. By applying the presented approach, residual in-formation caused by different attacks is obtained respectively and anomalies in the control system are detected. Sufficient and necessary conditions guaranteeing the detectability of the multiple stochastic <b>cyber-attacks</b> are obtained. The presented detection approach is simple and straightforward. Finally, two simulation examples are provided, and the simulation {{results show that the}} detection approach is effective and feasible.

A nonlinear H-infinity filter that maximize {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>cyber-attacks</b> and minimize the effect of the disturbances is designed. The nonlinear filter is required to be robust to the disturbances and the residual need to remain the sensitivity of the attacks as much as possible. Applying linear matrix inequality (LMI), the sufficient conditions guaranteeing the H-infinity filtering performance are obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the designed nonlinear filter efficiently solve the robust estimation problem of the stochastic <b>cyber-attacks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{by using}} the new ICT {{technologies}} the functional efficiency of the Smart Grid is increased {{but at the same}} time leads to a more vulnerable system and makes the Smart Grid a potential target for <b>cyber-attacks.</b> In fact, <b>cyber-attacks</b> are becoming one of the most serious threats in critical infrastructures.

25|$|A {{distributed}} denial-of-service (DDoS) is a <b>cyber-attack</b> {{where the}} perpetrator uses {{more than one}} unique IP address, often thousands of them.

40|$|International audienceTo {{answer the}} <b>cyber-attacks</b> on SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems, we wonder whether an attack {{tolerant}} {{approach can be}} implemented. Indeed, the most of networked control system security mechanisms are based on detection and rejection of the <b>cyber-attacks</b> control data. This rejection is easy to be detected by the attackers. As a result, the attackers will continue to improving their strategy in order {{to break down the}} security mechanism. They try until they reach their goals, and generally, during this time, there is no indication about presence of <b>cyber-attacks.</b> In addition to specific algorithms such Data Encryption Standard (DES), Message Digest (MD 5), timestamp, a new security mechanism based on the deception for the <b>cyber-attacks</b> is proposed. This mechanism, from a mathematical model of the plant, can make that the attackers believe that he has achieved the wished purpose, as they receive indication on their actions within the sensor reading.

Beginning with 2008's Project Chanology—a series of protests, pranks, and hacks targeting the Church of Scientology—the Anonymous collective became increasingly associated with collaborative hacktivism {{on a number of issues}} internationally. Individuals claiming to align themselves with Anonymous undertook protests and other actions (including direct action) in retaliation against copyright-focused campaigns by motion picture and recording industry trade associations. Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government agencies of the U.S., Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; child pornography sites; copyright protection agencies; the Westboro Baptist Church; and corporations such as PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and Sony. Anons have publicly supported WikiLeaks and the Occupy movement. Related groups LulzSec and Operation AntiSec carried out cyberattacks on U.S. government agencies, media, video game companies, military contractors, military personnel, and police officers, resulting in the attention of law enforcement to the groups' activities.

2500|$|In 2009, a {{year before}} Stuxnet was discovered, Scott Borg of the United States Cyber-Consequences Unit (US-CCU) {{suggested}} that Israel might prefer to mount a <b>cyber-attack</b> rather than a military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities.

So a tool like Stuxnet is Israel's obvious weapon of choice." [...] Iran uses P-1 centrifuges at Natanz, the design for which A. Q. Khan stole in 1976 and took to Pakistan. His black market nuclear-proliferation network sold P-1s to, among other customers, Iran. Experts believe that Israel also somehow acquired P-1s and tested Stuxnet on the centrifuges, installed at the Dimona facility that is part of its own nuclear program. The equipment may be from the United States, which received P-1s from Libya's former nuclear program.|$|E
