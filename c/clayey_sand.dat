40|$|After the Nigatta {{earthquake}} in Japan, in 1960, the liquefaction and its related hazards, {{moved to the}} thick of matter. Most of the research {{have been carried out}} on clean sands and silty sands so far, in order to study the effect of fine particles, confinement pressures, density and so on. However, because of this delusion that adhesiveness of clay prevents the liquefaction in <b>sand,</b> studies on <b>clayey</b> <b>sands</b> have not been taken seriously. However, several liquefactions happened in <b>clayey</b> <b>sands</b> in recent years, and lead to the necessity of more studies in this field. The studies which were carried out so far focused on high plastic clays. In this paper, the effect of low plasticity clays on the behavioral characteristics of sands is discussed. Thus, some triaxial tests were carried out on clean <b>sands</b> and <b>clayey</b> <b>sands</b> with different percentages of added clay. Specimens were compacted in various densities to study the effect of quantity of clay on various densities, too. Based on the findings, the amount of clay affects the behavior of sand greatly and leads to substantial changes in peak bearing capacity and steady state values...|$|R

30|$|The Ca 2 + {{varies from}} 8 to 569  mg/L, {{with a mean}} of 15, 20 and 65  mg/L in BC, FP and C zones, {{respectively}} (Table  1), while the Mg 2 + is from 17.39 to 204.20, being a high in C zone (88  mg/L), medium in FP zone (73  mg/L) and low in BC zone (41  mg/L). Relativity, the higher Mg 2 + than Ca 2 + is a result of ferro-magnesium minerals in soil salts and aquifer sediments, ion exchange between Na+ and Ca 2 +, precipitation of CaCO 3 and seawater intrusion (Todd 1980; Hem 1991; Drever 1997). The Na+ varies from 15.30 to 955.80  mg/L, which is observed to be low from BC (mean 193  mg/L), medium from C (mean 349  mg/L) and high from FP (mean 362  mg/L) zones due to influences of soil salts, deltaic <b>clayey</b> <b>sands,</b> coastal <b>clayey</b> <b>sands,</b> marine salts, anthropogenic activities, etc. on groundwater system. A low K+ (1.42 – 310.60  mg/L, {{with a mean of}} 23, 67 and 92  mg/L in BC, FP and C zones, respectively) indicates its tendency to be fixed by clay minerals (Hem 1991).|$|R

40|$|Abstract – This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} mechanical behavior of lime- stabilized <b>clayey</b> <b>sands.</b> The variations of compressive and tensile strengths of materials were investigated. Uniaxial and indirect tensile tests were performed {{and the results of}} stress-strain diagrams were used to present a simple nonlinear-elastic model. The results show that a simple parabolic elastic model can predict the stress-strain relation before failure. A matrix of elastic coefficients is then presented based on the suggested model and the stress level...|$|R

30|$|Previous {{investigations}} by Akpan and Edet (2005) {{concerning this}} highway had indicated that {{with respect to}} the underlying geology, frequent pavement failure is characteristic of this section of the highway alignment. The 17 -km stretch mentioned above is constructed on predominantly shale and marl soils, while the remaining sections were constructed on Coastal Plain <b>sands</b> and <b>clayey</b> <b>sands</b> of the Benin Formation. This high incidence of pavement failure of this stretch of the highway compared {{to other parts of the}} highway necessitated the investigation into the geotechnical properties of the subgrade soil in this section of the highway.|$|R
5000|$|The mallee {{typically}} {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 3 to 10 m and has grey over pink bark that is smooth. It blooms between November and April and produces white flowers.

Principal component analysis (PCA) {{based on the}} chemical composition and on the grain-size distribution of the archaeological and natural materials demonstrates that the analysed samples were made from the same raw material and that local <b>clayey</b> <b>sands</b> (Hupper, Side´rolithique) were exploited. Availability in situ of good raw materials made tempering unnecessary. Their high melting point (c. 1600 °C) allowed good performance in service conditions at temperatures up to 1500 °C.

40|$|The SRS/ITP Soil Evaluation Testing Program was {{developed}} and performed to investigate {{the behavior of the}} soil deposits at the Savannah River Site`s In-Tank Precipitation facility under dynamic loading. There were two distinct soil deposits involved in the current testing program: the Tobacco Road formation (sampled at depths between 28 and 100 feet at the site) and the Santee formation (sampled from depths between 170 and 180 feet). The Tobacco Road samples consisted of <b>clayey</b> <b>sands</b> (typically {open_quotes}SC{close_quotes} by the Unified Soil Classification System), yellow to reddish-brown in color with fine to medium sized sand particles. The Santee samples were also <b>clayey</b> <b>sands,</b> but nearly white in color. The two types of cyclic triaxial tests performed at the U. C. Berkeley Geotechnical Laboratories as part of this testing program were (a) traditional liquefaction tests and (b) low-amplitude cyclic tests designed to provide information on threshold strains for these specimens. This report describes the results of both the liquefaction testing component of the study, which was limited to the soils from the Tobacco Road formation, and the low-amplitude testing of both Tobacco Road and Santee specimens. Additional information was obtained from some of the specimens by (a) measuring the volumetric strains of many of the specimens when drainage (and reconsolidation) was permitted following liquefaction, or (b) determining the residual stress-strain behavior of other specimens subjected to monotonic loading immediately following liquefaction. This document is Volume 6 of the In-Tank Precipitation Facility (ITP) and H-Tank Farm (HTF) Geotechnical Report, and contains laboratory test results...|$|R

50|$|Indravarman I (877 - 889) {{and his son}} and {{successor}} Yasovarman I (889 - 900), who {{established the}} capital Yasodharapura ordered the construction of huge water reservoirs (barays) north of the capital. The water management network depended on elaborate configurations of channels, ponds and embankments built from huge quantities of <b>clayey</b> <b>sand,</b> the available bulk material on the Angkor plain. Dikes of the East Baray still exist today, which are more than 7 km long and 1.8 km wide. The largest component is the West Baray, a reservoir about 8 km long and 2 km across, containing approximately 50 million m3 of water.|$|E
40|$|Thick {{sections}} of kaolinitic sediments {{occur in the}} Lake Wales Ridge area of peninsular Florida. These materials, usually {{referred to as the}} Citronelle formation in the published literature, consist largely of quartz sand and gravel with a binder of kaolinire. In exposures the sediments often can be divided, from the surface downward, into three zones: (1) loose surface sands, (2) red and yellow <b>clayey</b> <b>sands,</b> and (3) white <b>clayey</b> <b>sands.</b> In much of western Putnam County, the present mining area, the loose surface sands have resulted from weathering and erosion of the kaolinitic sediments. The color of the reddish zone is due to oxidation above the water table of iron compounds. Throughout large areas the kaolin-bearing sands rest unconformably on the middle Miocene Hawthorne formation. On {{the eastern side of the}} Lake Wales Ridge, the kaolinitic sediments in some localities overlie shell marls of late Miocene or younger age. Present data indicate that kaolinitic day generally is more abundant in the lower part of the formation. This portion of the formation is dose to the surface in parts of Clay, Putnam, Marion, Lake and Polk counties. In areas where the Lake Wales Ridge is highest, for example in Polk County, the lower part of the formation can be found outcropping or close to the surface on the sides of the ridge and in low areas of the ridge crest. The kaolinire is believed to have been deposited as sedimentary day in an alluvial environment rather than having been derived from the weathering in sit • of feldspar sand or some clay mineral...|$|R
50|$|In Jefferson County to the east, the scarp {{coincides with}} the Wicomico Terrace with an {{elevation}} at 40-45 feet above mean sea level. The scarp separates the Hawthorn Group of fine to medium grained sandy clays and silty, <b>clayey</b> <b>sands</b> of the Red Hills Region of north Florida and southwest Georgia to the north from the fine to medium fine grained, partially recrystallized, silty to sandy limestones of the Gulf Coastal Lowlands to the south. A dramatic difference in elevation is seen here as the Red Hills, at a maximum of 70 meters (230 feet) mean sea level (MSL), drops to the area known as the Woodville Karst Plain, an elevation of 50 to 80 feet (15 to 24 meters) within 15 miles (24 km).|$|R
50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of electrokinetics is that the remediation can be conducted in situ (within the remediation site) to treat contaminants in low permeability zones to overcome accessibility of contaminants or delivery of treatment. Remediation can also occur ex situ (removed from the natural site) to have contaminants tested and treated within a laboratory. This versatility of treatment location can be very cost effective. Electrokinetics has the advantage of use in saturated or unsaturated soils because of the insertion of pore fluid. Remediation can also occur despite soil stratifications or homogeneity. For soils that are low in permeability like kaolite and <b>clayey</b> <b>sands</b> it is possible to remove up to 90% of heavy metal contaminants. In many cases pretreatment of soil should be made to determine appropriate working conditions of the soil.|$|R
