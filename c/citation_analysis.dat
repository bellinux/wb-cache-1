25|$|It {{has been}} stated that impact factors and <b>citation</b> <b>analysis</b> {{in general are}} {{affected}} by field-dependent factors which may invalidate comparisons not only across disciplines but even within different fields of research of one discipline. The percentage of total citations occurring {{in the first two}} years after publication also varies highly among disciplines from 1–3% in the mathematical and physical sciences to 5–8% in the biological sciences. Thus impact factors cannot be used to compare journals across disciplines.|$|E

An article by Robert Costanza, David Stern, Lining He, and Chunbo Ma responded to a call by Mick Common to determine the foundational literature of ecological economics by using <b>citation</b> <b>analysis</b> to examine which books and articles have had the most influence on the development of the field. However, citations analysis has itself proven controversial and similar work has been criticized by Clive Spash for attempting to pre-determine what is regarded as influential in ecological economics through study design and data manipulation. In addition, the journal Ecological Economics has itself been criticized for swamping the field with mainstream economics.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{relationship}} between citation ranking and peer evaluation in assessing senior faculty research performance. Other studies typically derive their peer evaluation data directly from referees often in the form of ranking. This study uses two additional sources of peer evaluation data: <b>citation</b> content <b>analysis</b> and book review content analysis. Two main questions are investigated: (a) To what degree does citation ranking correlate with data from <b>citation</b> content <b>analysis,</b> book reviews, and peer ranking? (b) Is citation ranking a valid evaluative indicator of research performance of senior faculty members? Citation data, book reviews, and peer ranking were compiled and examined for faculty members specializing in Kurdish studies. Analysis shows that normalized citation ranking and <b>citation</b> content <b>analysis</b> data yield identical ranking results. Analysis also shows that normalized citation ranking and <b>citation</b> content <b>analysis,</b> book reviews, and peer ranking perform similarly (i. e., are highly correlated) for high-ranked and low-ranked senior scholars. Additional evaluation methods and measures that take into account the context and content of research appear to be needed to effectively evaluate senior scholars whose performance ranks relatively in the middle. <b>Citation</b> content <b>analysis</b> data did appear to give some specific and important insights into the quality of research of these middle performers, however, further analysis and research is needed to validate this finding. This study shows that citation ranking can provide a valid indicator for comparative evaluation of senior faculty research performance...|$|R
500|$|In a {{citation}} graph the vertices are documents with {{a single}} publication date. The edges represent the citations from the bibliography of one document to other necessarily earlier documents. The classic example comes from the citations between academic papers as {{pointed out in the}} 1965 article [...] "Networks of Scientific Papers" [...] by Derek J. de Solla Price. [...] In this case the citation count of a paper is just the in-degree of the corresponding vertex of the citation network. This is an important measure in <b>citation</b> <b>analysis.</b> Court judgements provide another example as judges support their conclusions in one case by recalling other earlier decisions made in previous cases. A final example is provided by patents which must refer to earlier prior art, earlier patents which are relevant to the current patent claim. By taking the special properties of directed acyclic graphs into account, one can analyse these graphs with techniques not available when analysing the general graphs considered in many studies in network analysis. For instance transitive reduction gives a new insights into the citation distributions found in different applications highlighting clear differences in the mechanisms creating citations networks in different contexts. Another technique is main path analysis, which traces the citation links and suggests the most significant citation chains in a given citation graph.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the extent to which readers perceive correctly the reasons why authors cite items in scholarly texts. Design/methodology/approach – The authors of ten library and information science articles provided the reasons for citing material in their articles and these reasons were compared with those suggested independently by readers of the articles. Findings – Readers are able to perceive correctly author reasons for citation only to a very limited extent. Research limitations/implications – Limitations are a small sample of ten articles and 45 reader assessments of those articles, and the use of a single classification of reasons for citation. Practical implications – The findings call into question techniques such as <b>citation</b> context <b>analysis</b> that are based on the assumption that readers understand the reasons why authors cite material.
