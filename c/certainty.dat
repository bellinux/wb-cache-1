5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid: capacity, <b>certainty,</b> constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. <b>Certainty</b> refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. The trust instrument must show <b>certainty</b> of intention to create a trust, <b>certainty</b> of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and <b>certainty</b> of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees.|$|E
5|$|<b>Certainty</b> of objects: it must {{be clear}} who the {{beneficiaries}} (objects) are.|$|E
5|$|<b>Certainty</b> {{of subject}} matter: {{it must be}} clear what {{property}} {{is part of the}} trust and property, including sum of money, cannot be separated.|$|E
