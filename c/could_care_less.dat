2500|$|In José Canseco's book, , Canseco {{suggested}} that Clemens had expert knowledge about steroids and {{suggested that}} he used steroids, based on the improvement in his performance after leaving the Red Sox.

This symbolized the openness of the White House to the American people. White House Communications Director Toby Ziegler derisively refers to the day as [...] "Throw Open Our Office Doors To People Who Want To Discuss Things That We <b>Could</b> (sic) <b>Care</b> <b>Less</b> About Day", and Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman refers to it as [...] "Total Crackpot Day".|$|R

Shihfu did not seek leadership; it came naturally to her. The people who were fortunate enough {{to work with her}} understood her greatness and trusted her wisdom.|$|R

5000|$|By its impoverished terms, the rockist {{represents}} {{traditional values}} of authenticity while the poptimist is progressive, inclusive, and sees through the myths of authenticity. The rockist is nostalgic—the old fart who says they don’t make any good music anymore—while the poptimist looks forward and values the new. The rockist makes Art out of popular music, insists on serious meaning, and demands artists who sing their own songs and play instruments, preferably guitars; the poptimist lets pop be fun and, if not meaningless, slight. The rockist is a purist, the poptimist a pluralist; the rockist is old, the popist is young; the rockist is anti-commercialist, the poptimist <b>could</b> <b>care</b> <b>less.</b>|$|E

Despite Taylor's claims, Helios' win was still ruled as valid and was thus still the official new champion. On November 16 at Battle Of Who <b>Could</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Less,</b> Helios retained his Young Lions Cup title after defeating Hydra.

This question is often asked by trainees and junior staff physi-cians because the mountain seems very high from the bottom.

As William James, the philosopher, emphasized, he would be upset if someone denigrated his ability as a philosopher or violinist but <b>could</b> not <b>care</b> <b>less</b> if he was told he was poor at chess or cooking or golf. Having a special interest and collecting information and improving in that area of in-terest gives direction to the day’s activities and helps an individual’s sense of accomplishmen...|$|R
50|$|It is {{graduation}} {{time for}} the A-List crew. That means lavish yacht parties, designer caps and gowns, and saying bye-bye to high school for good. Despite the festivities, Anna {{is not in a}} partying mood. Ben has been acting distant and she is worried. Maybe her father's hot tattooed intern, Caine Manning, will help cheer Anna up! Ever since her illicit kiss with Parker, Sam has been Eduardo-less and heartbroken. But hopefully Sam will use her brains and considerable means to get creative about winning Eduardo back. And infamous Cammie? She <b>could</b> not <b>care</b> <b>less</b> about graduation, not when she is so close to unraveling the mystery of her mother's death.

[...] Ruffhouse co-owner Joe Nicolo somewhat backed up the guitarist's claims, alleging that while Ruffhouse intended to release the record, it was held up by executives at parent label Columbia, who instead wanted to release it through independent label Contract Recordings. The album, Reverb on the Click, was eventually released by Ginsburg's own labels years later.|$|E

It was a chance to go back and see her on expenses as the Samoans were paying for all my flights, accommodation and living expenses. I <b>could</b> not have <b>cared</b> <b>less</b> about playing for them. It was a men's tournament and I never expected to play." ...|$|R

In a match against Trinidad and Tobago, Hughes protested against what he saw as unreasonableness by the opposition by treating the remainder of the match with contempt; not attempting to win. Afterwards Hughes said he <b>could</b> not <b>care</b> <b>less</b> about the welfare of cricket in Trinidad and Tobago; the management fined him for this comment. In the second Test, Rodney Hogg threw a punch at Hughes, frustrated that he was not given the field he wanted by his captain.|$|R

Later, an old man tells Beauregard that he was bought out of a {{worthless}} gold mine by his partners Nevada and Red, only to have the mine produce lots of gold afterwards. Beauregard hurries off to the mine and catches Sullivan loading sacks of gold powder.

Van Driessen thanks Daria for sharing her thoughts and being honest about them, and only hopes that the two found {{what they were looking for}} in their harsh and hard lives.|$|R
