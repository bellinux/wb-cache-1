40|$|Although it is {{commonly}} believed that social relationships buffer the effects of stress on mental health, these apparent buffering effects may be spurious reflections of personality or prior mental health. This possibility was investigated in a prospective study of a medical school entrance examination.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{development}} of a cuprous oxide (Cu₂O) thin-film (TF) solar cell that is fabricated by manufacturing-friendly methods such as electro-deposition, sputtering and atomic layer deposition. Due to its bandgap of close to 2 eV, it has the potential of being applied as top cell in a tandem configuration. Firstly, I perform bottom-up cost and price analysis to investigate the economic feasibility of TF and c-Si based tandem photovoltaic modules. Next, I investigate the formation of good ohmic back contacts on Cu₂O absorber layer and demonstrate that low contact resistivity can be achieved with a variety of metals on heavily doped Cu₂O films by forming a tunnel junction. Then, I apply synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize two front <b>contact</b> <b>buffer</b> materials: amorphous Zn-Sn-O (a-ZTO) and Sndoped Ga₂O₃. I elucidate a fundamental loss mechanism in the amorphous Zn-Sn-O (a-ZTO) electron-blocking layer that has origin in local structural disorder and establish the structure-process- property relationship of a-ZTO so that the front buffer layer can be optimized for photovoltaics. Then, I investigate the doping mechanism of Sn dopant atoms in TFs and single crystalline Ga₂O₃:Sn by revealing the doping mechanism so that Ga₂O₃:Sn can be optimized for photovoltaics. Lastly. I apply bulk defect engineering to manipulate the intrinsic point defect structure of Cu₂O towards improved device performance. The key results will inform the processing conditions for improving mobility and minority carrier lifetime in Cu₂O.

In {{the event of a}} pandemic there may be a place for inexpensive, readily available, effective adjunctive therapies to support containment strategies such as prescription antivirals, vaccines, quarantine and restrictions on travel. Inactivation of virus in the intranasal environment is one possible approach. The work described here investigated the sensitivity of influenza viruses to low pH, and the activity of low pH nasal sprays on the course of an influenza infection in the ferret model. Methods Inactivation of influenza A and avian reassortment influenza was determined using in vitro solutions tests. Low pH nasal sprays were tested using the ferret model with an influenza A Sydney/ 5 / 97 challenge. Clinical measures were shed virus, weight loss and body temperature. Results The virus inactivation studies showed that influenza viruses are rapidly inactivated by <b>contact</b> with acid <b>buffered</b> solutions at pH 3. 5. The titre of influenza A Sydney/ 5 / 97 [H 3 N 2] was reduced by at least 3 log cycles with one minute <b>contact</b> with <b>buffers</b> based on simple acid mixtures such as L-pyroglutamic acid, succinic acid, citric acid and ascorbic acid. A pH 3. 5 nasal gel composition containing pyroglutamic acid, succinic acid and zinc acetate reduced titres of influenza A Hong Kong/ 8 / 68 [H 3 N 2] by 6 log cycles, and avian reassortment influenza A/Washington/ 897 / 80 X A Mallard/New York/ 6750 / 78 [H 3 N 2] by 5 log cycles, with 1 min contact. Two ferret challenge studies, with influenza A Sydney/ 5 / 97, demonstrated a reduction in the severity of the disease with early application of low pH nasal sprays versus a saline control. In the first study there was decreased weight loss in the treatment groups. In the second study there were reductions in virus shedding and weight loss, most notably when a gelling agent was added to the low pH formulation. Conclusion These findings indicate the potential of a low pH nasal spray as an adjunct to current influenza therapies, and warrant further investigation in humans. </p...|$|R

The influence of hydrophobic interactions on the deposition process was kept {{the same for all}} combinations of strains and polymers by choosing strains and polymers with similar water contact angles. Zeta potentials of the strains ranged from - 14. 5 to + 4. 5 mV and zeta potentials for the collector surfaces were - 13 mV for PMMA and + 2 mV for PMMA/TMAEMA-Cl. Deposition efficiencies were expressed as the ratios between the experimentally observed initial deposition rates and the initial deposition rates, calculated {{on the basis of the}} Smoluchowski-Levich approximation. In case of the negatively charged PMMA collectors, deposition efficiencies decreased with increasing electrostatic repulsion between bacteria and the collector, as theoretically expected. However, in case of the positively charged PMMA/TMAEMA-Cl collectors, no such relation was found.

40|$|Open-circuit {{impedance}} spectra, channel impedance spectroscopy on solution-gated field-effect devices, and {{differential capacitance}} vs potential (Mott−Schottky) measurements {{were used to}} determine the energetics of n-Si(111), n-Si(100), and p-Si(111) electrodes in contact with aqueous 11 M (40 % by weight) NH_ 4 F, buffered HF (BHF), 27 M (48 %) HF(aq), and concentrated (18 M) H_ 2 SO_ 4. A Mott−Schottky analysis of A_s^ 2 C_(sc) ^(- 2) -vs-E (where As is the interfacial area, and C_(sc) is the differential capacitance {{as a function of the}} electrode potential, E) data yielded reliable barrier heights for some silicon/liquid contacts in this work. Performing a Mott−Schottky analysis, however, requires measurement of the differential capacitance under reverse bias, where oxidation or etching can occur for n-Si and where electroplating of metal contaminants can occur for p-Si. Hence, open-circuit methods would offer desirable, complementary approaches to probing the energetics of such contacts. Accordingly, open-circuit, near-surface channel conductance measurements have been performed using solution-gated n^+-p-Si(111) -n^+ and p^+-n-Si(100) -p^+ devices. Additionally, open-circuit impedance spectra were obtained for silicon electrodes in contact with these solutions. The combination of the three techniques indicated that the surfaces of n-Si(111) and n-Si(100) were under accumulation when in contact with either 11 M NH_ 4 F(aq) or BHF(aq). The barrier heights for n-Si(111) and n-Si(100) in 11 M NH_ 4 F(aq) were − 0. 065 ± 0. 084 V and − 0. 20 ± 0. 21 V, respectively, and were − 0. 03 ± 0. 19 V and − 0. 07 ± 0. 24 V, respectively, for these surfaces in <b>contact</b> with <b>buffered</b> HF(aq). Consistently, p-Si(111) surfaces were determined to be in inversion in contact with these electrolytes, exhibiting barrier heights of 0. 984 ± 0. 078 V in contact with 11 M NH_ 4 F(aq) and 0. 97 ± 0. 22 V in <b>contact</b> with <b>buffered</b> HF(aq). In <b>contact</b> with 27 M HF(aq), n-Si(111) and n-Si(100) were in depletion, with barrier heights of 0. 577 ± 0. 038 V and 0. 400 ± 0. 057 V, respectively, and p-Si(111) was under inversion with a barrier height of 0. 856 ± 0. 076 V. Measurements performed in 18 M H_ 2 SO_ 4 revealed barrier heights of 0. 75 ± 0. 11 V, 0. 696 ± 0. 043 V, and 0. 889 ± 0. 018 V for n-Si(111), n-Si(100), and p-Si(111), respectively, demonstrating that in 18 M H_ 2 SO_ 4, the band edge positions of Si were different for different doping types. The barrier height data demonstrate that the observed low recombination rates of silicon in contact with 11 M NH_ 4 F, BHF, or 18 M H_ 2 SO_ 4 cannot necessarily be attributed to a reduction in the number of surface trap states. In part, low surface recombination rates are expected for such systems because the very large or very small barrier height for silicon in contact with these liquids provides a potential barrier that prevents one type of photogenerated carrier (either electrons or holes) from reaching the surface, thereby producing a low steady-state surface recombination rate...|$|R

This anomaly in dielectric constant and tand and its magnetic field dependence is explained as an influence of strain due to lattice mismatch between the substrate and YMnO 3 film. A substantial enhancement in magnetocapacitance was also observed for magnetic field applied parallel to ab plane of the film. Our results show {{that it is possible to}} tune the multiferroic property of YMnO 3 via changes in ferroelastic route. Comment: 17 pages, 4 figures. Accepted for publication in J. Appl. Phy...|$|R
40|$|We {{reported}} the favorable cathode buffer layer {{based on a}} blend of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) and TiO 2 nanorods (NRs) applied to inverted solar cells. In addition to the high optical transmittance, the resultant blend film gave a relatively dense film with lower roughness {{than that of the}} respective single-component film. This improved the interface <b>contact</b> between the <b>buffer</b> layer and photoactive layer and therefore reduced the contact resistance and leakage current. Moreover, the combination of NRs and NPs increased the efficiency of electron transport and collection by providing both a direct path for electron transport from TiO 2 NRs and a large contact area between ZnO NPs and the active layer. Consequently, both the short-circuit current density (J(sc)) and fill factor (FF) in the device were improved, leading to an improvement of the device performance. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) based on the blend film as the buffer layer reached 8. 82 %, which was preferable to those of a single ZnO NP film (7. 76 %) and a TiO 2 NR-based device (7. 66 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Delay tolerant-network is {{emerging}} technology in wireless communication. This network is applied generally {{when there is}} no end-to-end path from source to destination. In current TCP/IP technology communication is possible only when end-to-end path is available. But two major issues in DTN (Abbreviation) are routing and buffer management. Routing strategy determine which message should be forwarded when node comes in <b>contact</b> with another. <b>Buffer</b> management policy strategy determines which message will be dropped when node is overflow. These two are very useful strategies that are used in DTN. In this paper we have proposed a new buffer management policy based on message forwarding and message replication on the network. We have introduced two utility functions. These functions are to find which message will be dropped when buffer overflow occurs. There is a special protocol named Bundle Protocol (BP) that is not in TCP/IP. Bundle protocol (BP) provides store-carry-forward mechanism that means when node is not in radio range then message is hold by the node and when node comes in range then message will be forwarded...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a state-of-the-art {{analysis of the}} expected degradation processes {{of a variety of}} candidate container materials for the disposal of high-level waste and/or spent nuclear fuel. The work, focusing on the most recent developments, has been performed {{under the auspices of the}} Implementing Geological Disposal Technology Platform in the context of an international conference hosted by the Nuclear Waste Management Organisation of Canada (NWMO). The scope of the analysis includes the expected corrosion and environmentally assisted cracking behaviour of copper, carbon steel and titanium in <b>contact</b> with relevant <b>buffer</b> materials (e. g. bentonite, cement) and in conditions expected in an underground disposal facility (long-term anoxic conditions). Considerations relative to the expected evolution of the environmental conditions (especially in the period following backfilling) are also presented. Beyond summarising the current state of knowledge, areas in which opportunities for international collaboration may be present are also highlighted. This paper is part of a supplement on the 6 th International Workshop on Long-Term Prediction of Corrosion Damage in Nuclear Waste Systems. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|By using porous {{polypropylene}} as a support, we have {{measured the}} <b>contact</b> angle of <b>buffered</b> aqueous droplets on surfaces which were over half bis(2 -ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphate, HA. From the {{variation of the}} contact angle with the pH of the aqueous solution the degree of dissociation, a, of HA has been evaluated {{as a function of}} pH. By defining the standard states of the interfacial HA and its conjugate base at the 50 % ionized aqueous- organic interface, a pKR is obtained for the interfacial acid, equal to the pH of the aqueous solution which is in equilibrium with the 50 % ionized interfacial acid. Following Katchalsky and Spitnik 14 the ratio of the activity coefficient of the conjugate base yA- to the activity coefficient of the acid, yHA is equated to [a/(l - afn l>] for a values near 0. 5. This permits the evaluation of the empirical parameter, n, and leads to a relation between pH and a. pH = pKa-n log[(1 -a) /a] This relation is found to hold from a > 0. 1 to a < 0. 9, although it cannot be valid for either a = 0. 0 or a = 1. 0...|$|R
