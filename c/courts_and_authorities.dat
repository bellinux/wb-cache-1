Moreover, most of Lithuanian deputies on Tuesday annulled the presidential veto. (...) Also this week, the Ukrainian Culture Ministry banned the movie Brüno because of its [...] "homosexual propaganda". (...) Latvia and Poland are no less homophobic societies than Lithuania, Ukraine and Russia. But already in early 2000s Latvian and Polish gay activists have chosen absolutely different strategy of LGBT visibility. First in Poland, then in Latvia, Gay Pride Parades were organised - the strongest and the most efficient gay events, both in media and in politics. Latvian and Polish activists had mounted a very hard legal and political battle against homophobic bans by local <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> <b>authorities.</b> Now Gay Pride Parades are held in Riga, Warsaw and Kraków. At the same time neither in Latvia nor in Poland have been passed such shameful laws introducing homophobic censorship like Lithuanian parliament did." ...|$|E

This article asks whether this is the case: do we lack an assessment framework of MFNs under EU competition law? In answering this question, regard is had to both older case law and the most recent developments. Taken together, most of the issues in assessing MFNs do appear to be generally agreed upon.

In the article, the attempt is made to apply their methods to analyze the problems of corruption in Russian higher education system which existed before the adoption of new educational legislation which came into force in 2013. The subjects of examination in this article are: definition of corruption in Russian legislation, system of control of educational institutions in Russia from 2000 to 2009, corruption at the policy level, at the ministerial level, at the university level. The author states that the legislation and court practice in Russia {{in the first decade of}} the 21 st century enabled educational institutions to do some kinds of activities in corrupted way. Besides that, the legislation and the corpus of case-law were too complicated. Some laws and decisions made by <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> <b>authorities</b> might contradict one another.

40|$|Copyright law {{is facing}} its biggest {{challenge}} yet as it copes with technological development and an increasingly global information market. The advent of peer-to-peer networks has multiplied {{the threat to}} the peaceful enjoyment of copyrights and made any user a potential infringer. Nonetheless, copyright holders, in targeting those users, have greatly impinged on the users' fundamental rights, in particular the right to privacy. This Article examines the tension between copyright and privacy in Europe. In particular, this Article will review the legal framework of the debate as well as the relevant case law, both at the community level and the national level. The analysis will specifically focus on the lawfulness of the collection of personal data of peer-to-peer network users as a tool to fight piracy. In order to strike a fair balance between copyright and privacy, many different subject matters, such as data protection law, copyright law and e-commerce law, must be carefully weighted. In addition, relevant opinions on the issue of fair balance of copyright and privacy have been expressed by the European Data Protection Working Party and the European Court of Justice. Finally, since the EU law - when applied to file exchange in peer-to-peer systems - is inconclusive, we must turn to national <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> <b>authorities</b> to verify the practical implementation of the ECJ guidelines. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|Article 10 of the European Community Treaty has {{gradually}} {{given rise to}} a large body of case law {{on a wide variety of}} subjects, including several profoundly important constitutional principles of Community law: the duty of national courts to give effective protection to rights given by Community law, the duty to give direct effect to directives against the State, the duty to interpret national law so as to be compatible with Community law, and the right to judicial review. These principles are the foundation of the constitutional structure that the Court of Justice has built, in which national courts ensure the rule of Community law in most of the circumstances in which it applies. This Article describes the development of the case law of the Court of Justice, divided for convenience, somewhat arbitrarily, into three periods. The periods are 1952 to 1990, 1990 to 2000, and 2000 to date. As will be seen, much of the elaboration of the case law occurred between 1990 and 2000, although several basic principles had been established before that. Before tracing this development, one feature of the Community legal system needs to be explained, since it is fundamental, and very different from other legal systems such as the U. S. legal system. The rules of European Community (“EC”) law, and now of European Union (“EU”) law, are primarily applied and enforced by national <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> <b>authorities,</b> and not by the Community institutions. The national law and Community law spheres are not separate bodies of law applied by separate institutions. There is no line of demarcation between the two. This fact makes Article 10 much more important than it would otherwise be. It also explains why the case law on Article 10 developed gradually, and is still developing...|$|E
40|$|In {{the market}} today, {{there is a}} great need of {{trademark}} protection for packaging, since design is important and valuable for manufacturers to distinguish their goods. It is, however, not easy to obtain such trademark protection. The purpose behind my master thesis is to examine how a packaging should be designed to obtain trademark registration in Sweden and in the EC. My starting point is SCA Hygiene’s egg-shaped plastic packaging for panty liners (the egg). The egg was refused registration by PRV due to lack of distinctiveness but was allowed registration as an EC trademark by OHIM. The question I have asked myself is why the assessment of distinctiveness differs between Sweden and the EC although Sweden has changed its law after the EC directive on harmonisation of the member states´ trademark law. To answer the question, in my thesis I have examined the conditions for registration stated in the EC directive {{as well as in the}} Swedish law and how <b>courts</b> <b>and</b> <b>authorities</b> have interpreted them. My intention is that the thesis shall be suitable for using as guidance for companies wanting to protect packaging with the help of intellectual property laws and especially the Trademark Act. The guidelines can be used both when wanting to design a packaging, to make it possible to register it as trademark as well as to assess whether an already existing packaging is possible to register. To decide whether a packaging is possible to register the first step is to determine whether it is possible to reproduce graphically. The next step is to decide whether it is distinctive. The authorities and courts assess distinctiveness first in relation to the goods for which registration has been requested and secondly in the relation to the perception of the public. Therefore the relevant market for the goods must be analysed as well as what competitors’ packaging look like. It is also necessary to consider who the product is directed towards. Finally the packaging itself must be studied to assess whether it is only an ordinary fundamental form or if it has any special elements and the total impression of it. The packaging cannot be banal to obtain protection. The last thing to examine before an application for trademark registration is whether the exceptions in CTMR Article 7 (1) (e) are applicable. However, I have not found any cases where trademark applications have been refused because of these exceptions. I have noticed a tendency that it is easier to obtain trademark protection for packaging in the EC. However, the examiners both in PRV and in OHIM use almost the same principles and follow the case law from ECJ and CFI. The differences in assessing distinctiveness are probably because the examiners are different persons with different opinions and experience. I have reached the purpose behind my thesis through studying literature; books and articles as well as studying case law from PRV, PBR, RegR, OHIM, the Court of First Instance and the ECJ. To obtain a practical view and see whether my conclusions are true in practice, I have made two interviews...|$|E
