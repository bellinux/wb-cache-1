40|$|A {{two stage}} Gifford-McMahon cycle <b>cryorefrigerator</b> {{operating}} at 20 K is described. This refrigerator uses {{a very simple}} ‘spool valve’ and a modified indigenous compressor to compress helium gas. This <b>cryorefrigerator</b> reaches a lowest temperature of 15. 5 K; it takes ≈ 50 min to reach 20 K and the cooling capacity is ≈ 2. 5 W at 25 K. The cool-down characteristics and load characteristics are presented in graphical form. The effect of changing the operating pressure ratio and the second stage regenerator matrix size are also reported. Pressure-volume (P-V) diagrams obtained at various temperatures indicate that P-V losses form the major {{fraction of the total}} losses and this becomes more pronounced as the temperature is decreased. A heat balance analysis shows the relative magnitudes of various losses...|$|E
40|$|AbstractComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is the {{emerging}} technique for analysis and performance prediction of a pulse tube refrigerator. The regenerator {{plays an important}} role in any <b>cryorefrigerator,</b> and hence to predict the realistic performance, proper boundary conditions are required in CFD tool. The modeling of regenerator requires appropriate definition and knowledge about hydrodynamic parameters viz. viscous resistance, inertial resistance and porosity. The present work report, CFD assisted prediction of hydrodynamic parameters for some widely used regenerator wire mesh structures selected on the basis of different porosity, which can predict the same pressure drop and friction factor obtained from experimental correlation equation. A unique value of viscous and inertial resistance is obtained iteratively for each mesh screen structures over a range of mass flow rate. These data can be readily used as boundary conditions for CFD simulations of the test section...|$|E
40|$|Supersonic {{beams of}} {{hydrogen}} atoms, prepared selectively in Rydberg-Stark states of {{principal quantum number}} n in the range between 25 and 35, have been deflected by 90 ^∘, decelerated and loaded into off-axis electric traps at initial densities of ≈ 10 ^ 6 atoms/cm^- 3 and translational temperatures of 150 mK. The ability to confine the atoms spatially was exploited to study their decay by radiative and collisional processes. The evolution {{of the population of}} trapped atoms was measured for several milliseconds in dependence of the principal quantum number of the initially prepared states, the initial Rydberg-atom density in the trap, and the temperature of the environment of the trap, which could be varied between 7. 5 K and 300 K using a <b>cryorefrigerator.</b> At room temperature, the population of trapped Rydberg atoms was found to decay faster than expected {{on the basis of their}} natural lifetimes, primarily because of absorption and emission stimulated by the thermal radiation field. At the lowest temperatures investigated experimentally, the decay was found to be multiexponential, with an initial rate scaling as n^- 4 and corresponding closely to the natural lifetimes of the initially prepared Rydberg-Stark states. The decay rate was found to continually decrease over time and to reach an almost n-independent rate of more than (1 ms) ^- 1 after 3 ms. To analyze the experimentally observed decay of the populations of trapped atoms, numerical simulations were performed which included all radiative processes, i. e., spontaneous emission as well as absorption and emission stimulated by the thermal radiation. These simulations, however, systematically underestimated the population of trapped atoms observed after several milliseconds by almost two orders of magnitude, although they reliably predicted the decay rates of the remaining atoms in the trap.

40|$|Abstract. We give here {{an update}} on the CUORE {{cryogenic}} system. It consists of a large cryogen-free cryostat cooled by five pulse tubes and one high-power specially designed dilution refrigerator built by Leiden Cryogenics. The cryostat design has been completed and it is presently under construction. The site at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory is ready for the installation of the cryostat which is expected to begin by the end of 2009. We discuss here the preliminary results obtained on the performance of the mechanical <b>cryorefrigerators.</b> We also present a measurement of the residual heat leak of the copper which has been selected for the cryostat fabrication...|$|R
40|$|Superconductivity as a {{phenomenon}} was discovered over 100 {{years ago and}} the first commercially viable materials have been in use for over 50 years. Today, the truly commercial applications in medical imaging and scientific research are limited to operating temperatures near 4. 2 K. However, the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in 1986, and the discovery of superconductivity in magnesium diboride, MgB 2, in 2001, {{have the potential for}} changing this. The high temperature superconductors have proven to be useful in many appli-cations including electric machinery and power transfer. However, their wide spread application is in part limited by their steep price. This is not the case with MgB 2. The cheap and easy-to-manufacture material {{has been shown to be}} competitive at applications with low to medium strength magnetic fields at an elevated operation temperature of 20 K. The most important commercial appli-cation, the magnetic resonance imaging falls within this range. These elevated operation temperatures are cost-effectively reachable with conduction-cooling and mechanical <b>cryorefrigerators,</b> i. e. cryocoolers. Designing and engineer-ing of such dry system requires different approaches than their liquid coole...|$|R
40|$|Cryopreservation is {{the set of}} {{practices}} applied to bring cells to cryogenic temperatures without producing injuries. In fact, the obsolescence of cells is caused by chemical reactions, and {{the rate at which}} these reactions occur can be drastically reduced by lowering the temperature. The lower the storage temperature, the longer cells can be kept. For instance, at temperatures of - 80 °C (dry ice) cells can be preserved for months, even if some chemical reactions can occur, while temperatures of - 196 °C (liquid nitrogen) can guarantee indefinite storage. Nowadays the freezing of cells is carried out through programmable freezers: this kind of machines use liquid nitrogen to reach the storage temperature. However, the use of liquid nitrogen is a limiting factor in many situations of inefficient or absent nitrogen distribution network, such as small industries, isolated places and during transport of cells. Since the early 1950 s, many studies have been carried out on the possibility to reduce injuries to cells subjected to freezing. No analytical approach has emerged, but an “unwritten rule” states the optimal range for cooling velocity between 0, 1 °C/min and 10 °C/min [1]. The characteristic curve (temperature on the cold-head vs time) of a Pulse Tube refrigerator observed during experimental analysis has shown that the close cycle <b>cryorefrigerator</b> can be used for cell preservation, if equipped with a control system for the cooling rate. Almost all the machines employed in the field of freezing cells use liquid nitrogen. The interest in the Pulse Tube refrigerator is due to a reduced need of continuous maintenance for adding technical gas. Even the absence of magnetic field and the reduction of vibrations near the cold-head make this kind of refrigerator suitable for the cryopreservation of cells. The mathematical approach theorized aims at regulating the cold-head temperature through the prevision of electric power to be dissipated in a passive component, allowing to obtain a freezing curve induced by the PT, coincident with the one established by the molecular theory. A resistor linked with a power amp was used to produce heat for Joule effect to control the cooling rate. The dissipated power was handled by a software realized with LabView™ that monitors temperature both of the cold-head and of the test tube containing the cells. The results obtained theoretically have then been compared with experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response (MINER) Act of 2006 {{implemented}} {{new regulations}} {{in the underground}} coal mining industry that allow for the certification of non-compressed gas equipment for respiratory protection in underground coal mines. NASA’s Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Biomedical Research and Engineering Laboratory (BRL) is investigating the potential to expand cryogenic air supply systems into the mining and general industries. These investigations have, so far, resulted in four separate comparison and hardware development programs. The Propellant Handlers Ensemble (PHE) and Level “A” Ensemble Comparison (LAE) : This study compared worker thermal stress while using the industry standard Level A hazardous material handling ensemble as opposed to using the similarly protective Propellant Handler’s Ensemble (PHE) that utilizes a cryogenic air supply pack, known as an Environmental Control Unit (ECU) {{as opposed to the}} compressed air Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) used in the LAE. The research found that, in a 102 °F environment, test subjects experienced significantly decreased body temperature increases, significantly decreased heart rate increases, and decreased sweat loss while performing a standard work routine while using the PHE, compared to the same test subjects performing the same routine while using the LAE. The Cryogenic Refuge Alternative Supply System (CryoRASS) project: The MINER Act of 2006 requires the operators of underground coal mines to provide refuge alternatives that can provide a safe atmosphere for workers for up to 96 hours {{in the event of a}} mine emergency. The CryoRASS project retrofitted an existing refuge chamber with a liquid air supply instead of the standard compressed air supply system and performed a 96 hour test. The CryoRASS system demonstrated that it provided a larger air supply in a significantly smaller footprint area, provided humidity and temperature control, and maintained acceptable oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the chamber for the required amount of time. SCBA and Mine Rescue System (CryoBA/CryoASFS) Another requirement of the MINER Act is that additional emergency breathing equipment must be staged along evacuation routes to supplement the Self Contained/Self Rescue (SCSR) devices that are now required. The BRL has developed an SCBA known as the Cryogenic Breathing Apparatus (CryoBA), that has the ability to provide 2 hours of breathing air, a refill capability, and some cooling for the user. Cryogenic Air Storage and Filling Stations (CryoASFS) would be positioned in critical areas to extend evacuation time. The CryoASFS stations have a significantly smaller footprint and larger air storage capacity to similar compressed air systems. The CryoBA pack is currently undergoing NIOSH certification testing. Technical challenges associated with liquid breathing air systems: Research done by the BRL has also addressed three major technical challenges involved with the widespread use of liquid breathing air. The BRL developed a storage Dewar fitted with a <b>Cryorefrigerator</b> that has stored liquid air for four months with no appreciable oxygen enrichment due to differential evaporation. Testing of liquid breathing air was material and time intensive. A BRL contract developed a system that only required 1 liter of air and five minutes of time compared to the 10 liters of air and 75 minutes of time required by the old method. The BRL also developed a simple and cost effective method of manufacturing liquid air that joins a liquid oxygen tanker with a liquid nitrogen tanker through an orifice controlled “Y” fitting, mixing the two components, and depositing the mixed breathing air in a separate tanker...|$|E
