25|$|Young came to {{love the}} City of London. He relished command of a force small enough to know every constable well. He enjoyed the City's rich social life too, and he much valued the {{invitation}} to join the Goldsmiths Company. The police needed to recruit and with considerable success he set about making service more attractive. Pay and allowances were increased, housing modernised, and catering improved. Uniforms were made more comfortable and practical. At another level, he pushed through changes in career structures. He engineered a national recruitment revolution in the British police, running command courses and seeing through a fast-track entry scheme to attract graduates - and for many years he was director of extended interviews for the Senior <b>Command</b> <b>Course</b> that he had founded.|$|E

Thimayya was the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), and Krishna Menon, the defence minister. During Menon's visit to Manekshaw's division, he asked him what he thought of his chief. Manekshaw replied that it was not appropriate for him to think of his chief in that way, and told Menon not to ask anybody again. This annoyed Menon and he told Manekshaw that if he wanted to, he could sack Thimayya, to which Manekshaw replied, [...] "You can get rid of him. But then I will get another." [...] This heated conversation with Menon later proved to be a thorn in his career.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his tour}} in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Colbert had worked closely with Burke as one of Burke's action {{officers}} when Burke {{was director of the}} Plans Division, and Burke remembered Colbert's unusual competence in international relations. Moreover, during that tour Colbert had actually written a brief staff study on the best way to educate foreign naval officers at Navy service schools without compromising either national security or the level of their instruction. Based on that four-year-old study, Colbert spent the summer of 1956 preparing for the arrival of students from up to 30 countries in August. To avoid using the word [...] "foreign", he selected the title [...] "Naval <b>Command</b> <b>Course</b> for Free World Naval Officers." ...|$|E
2500|$|As CINCSOUTH, Colbert's {{principal}} {{concern was}} {{to reduce the}} tension between Greece and Turkey. He reconstituted the Naval On-Call Force Mediterranean (NAVOCFORMED) using Greek, Turkish, Italian, British, and U.S. ships. He also negotiated a treaty with France, which had withdrawn its armed forces from NATO in 1966, to allow annual naval exercises, culminating in a combined Franco-American naval exercise {{off the coast of}} the United States in 1973. Chief of Naval Operations Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr. rated Colbert [...] "one of our most outstanding NATO commanders" [...] due to the decades-long personal relationships he maintained with the alumni of the naval <b>command</b> <b>course,</b> many of whom had become high-ranking flag officers in their respective navies. Zumwalt dubbed Colbert [...] "Mr. International Navy" [...] for his {{reputation as one of the}} very few senior admirals in the U.S. Navy identified with international naval cooperation.|$|E
2500|$|Colbert {{served as}} {{director}} of the naval <b>command</b> <b>course</b> for its first two classes. Students generally attended the regular Naval War College lectures for the naval warfare 1 course, and took field trips during lectures dealing with classified topics such as nuclear operations. Colbert leveraged his extensive personal contacts to arrange visits to military and naval sites, as well as industrial plants in Buffalo, New York, and the New York Stock Exchange. Colbert and his wife also spent a considerable amount of their own money to organize social events to foster lasting informal ties between students, whose personal bonding was viewed as almost as important as the formal curriculum. Colbert was impressed by the high quality of the inaugural class, writing, [...] "The capability of the students is far beyond our expectationsthey really look like the 'future CNO's of the Free World' as Admiral Burke describes them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{significant}} event {{of his presidency}} was the establishment in 1956 of the naval <b>command</b> <b>course,</b> a new course for senior naval officers from up to 30 allied and friendly nations, organized and directed by Captain Richard G. Colbert {{at the behest of}} Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh A. Burke. The Naval War College staff was initially unenthusiastic about the new course, worrying that it would detract from the regular courses. However, McCormick had already witnessed the difficulties caused by a lack of inter-allied understanding during large-scale SACLANT operations like Operation Mainbrace, and he gave Burke his full cooperation. Burke recalled, [...] " [...] was absolutely correct that this new course should not reduce the caliber of the other work the War College was doing. The president and his staff made many helpful suggestions right from the start and after it was going awhile, their enthusiasm grew, perhaps due {{to the quality of the}} foreign officers assigned." ...|$|E
