40|$|Dietary Cation-Anion Balance in Dairy Cattle Nutrition. AReview. Dietary Cation-Anion Balance (DCAB) is a relativelynew {{concept in}} Dairy Cattle {{nutrition}} and feeding. it is definedas mEq (Na+K) -(Cl+S) /kg of DM. Metabolic acidosis andalkalosis {{is given by}} blood protein concentration and byinorganic ions absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. If weconsider blood protein concentration to be relatively constant,the metabolic acid-base balance of blood and cells is attributedmainly to inorganic cations and anions supplied by the diet. Anions have an acidogenic effect in the organism, while cationsare alkalogenic. Changes in the metabolic acid-base balancecan affect celular enzyme activity {{and the structure of}} hormonereceptors, reducing production of the animals and resistanceto metabolic imbalances. However, technical manipulation ofthis balance can contribute to improve health, production andreproduction. Several studies have found that feeding anionic(acidogenic diets) (- 100 to - 200 mEq/kg of DM) during the last 3 to 4 weeks of the gestation period contribute to improvecalcium metabolism and to reduce the level of hypocalcemianormally occurring during the puerperal period, reducing incidence of milk fever and other problems such as retentionof fetal membranes. Also, it has been observed that cows fedthese diets improved milk production in 3 to 7 % during thenext lactation, as well as reproduction. About the best DCABto be fed during the lactation period, it has been found thatalkalogenic diets are better for milk production. Some workershave found the best milk production and DM intake feedingdiets with a DCAB of + 300 to + 500 mEq/kg of DM (calculatedas (Na+K-CI)).

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of pharmaceuticals {{in the environment}} have been a topic of increasing concern. Most of the pharmaceuticals are not completely mineralized {{in the human body}} and are released on the sewage systems as the pharmaceutical itself and as their “biologically active” metabolites through excretion, as well as by improper elimination and disposal. Once current wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are not designed to remove these emerging pollutant, they are easily released into the environment. The effects of halogen on biological properties of molecules have had a marked impact on various fields such as pharmacology. It can improve metabolic stability, bioavailability and interactions with the biological target. However, it also increases the recalcitrance of the molecule to biotic and abiotic degradation. Ciprofloxacin (CPF) and Diclofenac (DCF) are two widely used halogenated pharmaceuticals, commonly found in the environment in concentrations that can range ng L− 1 to mg L− 1. CPF is a common human and veterinary broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic. DCF is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), also used as analgesic and antithermic treatment. In the present study, biodegradation of CPF and DCF was assessed by selective enrichements with actived sludge and with pure cultures of three different strains - Labrys portucalensis (F 11) and two Rhodococcus spp. (FP 1 and S 2) – which had previously demonstrated capacity to degrade a range of halogenated compounds. For CPF selective enrichments, a degradation of 100 % was achived after 206 days, although without fluoride release. These findings indicate that these selective enrichments are good candidates to find a bacterial strain able to biodegrade CPF. Regarding the pure cultures, F 11 exhibited the highest degradation capacity (57 %) after 62 days, but also without fluoride release.

Up to 40 kbar (= 4 GPa), the decrease of carrier concentration as the pressure increases is explained through {{the existence of a}} subsidiary minimum in the conduction band. This minimum shifts towards lower energies under pressure, with a pressure coefficient of about - 105 meV/GPa, and its related impurity level traps electrons as it reaches the band gap and approaches the Fermi level. The pressure value at which the electron trapping starts is shown to depend on the electron concentration at ambient pressure and the dimensionality of the electron gas. At low pressures the electron mobility increases under pressure for both 3 D and 2 D electrons, the increase rate being higher for 2 D electrons, which is shown to be coherent with previous scattering mechanisms models. The phase transition from the semiconductor layered phase to the metallic sodium <b>cloride</b> phase is observed as a drop in resistivity around 105 kbar, but above 40 kbar a sharp nonreversible increase of the carrier concentration is observed, which is attributed to the formation of donor defects as precursors of the phase transition.

The same applied to the zinc and cadmium uptake of plants grown on plots. Nickel, cadmium and copper were easily accumulated by plants from air deposition. In the pot experiment, high nickel concentrations in soil were more phytotoxic for oats than were high copper concentrations. In acidic soil, nickel and copper concentrations lower than 20 and 100 mg/kg of soil, respectively, decreased the dry matter yield of oats shoots. Liming clearly decreased copper and nickel phytotoxity. In the most highly contaminated soil, the addition of Cu 20 mg/kg of soil decreased the yield of oats shoots. ...|$|E
40|$|Akaganeite (Beta-FeOOH, chloride-containing Fe(III) (hydr) oxide) {{has been}} {{recently}} discovered {{on the surface}} of Mars by the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover in Yellowknife Bay, Gale Crater, Mars [1] and from orbit by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in Robert Sharp crater and Antoniadi basin [2]. However, the mechanism and aqueous environmental conditions of akaganeite formation (e. g., pH and chloride concentration) remain unknown. We have investigated formation of akaganeite through Fe(III) hydrolysis at variable initial pH and chloride concentrations. The formed Fe(III) precipitates were characterized by instruments similar to instruments on Mars robotic spacecraft. Syntheses were performed through hydrolysis of Fe(III) perchlorate with addition of Na <b>cloride</b> (Fe/Cl ratio between 0. 5 and 5) and at initial pH of 1. 5, 2, 4, 6 and 8 at 90 degC. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed formation of akaganeite alone or in mixture with goethite, hematite and ferrihydrite at all initial pHs and Fe/Cl ratio between 0. 5 and 2 while akaganeite precipitated only at pH 1. 5 and Fe/Cl greater than 2. Chloride content of akaganeite was affected by initial pH and decreased from 20 - 60 mg/g at pH 1. 5 to less than 0. 1 mg/g at pH 8. The synthesized akaganeite samples were also characterized by Mssbauer and infrared spectroscopy and volatiles were analysed by thermal and evolved gas analysis. The obtained characterization data will be compared to published data from rover and orbital missions [1 - 3] to determine martian akaganeite composition, crystallinity and formation conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which are used in high doses in chronic inflammatory conditions is not clearly understood. Their known protein-stabilizing properties could play a significant role. The inhibition of cyclooxygenase may not be essential for their anti-rheumatic activity, since compounds with strong anti-denaturant properties and devoid of anti-inflammatory activity were shown {{to be effective in}} an experimental model of rheumatoid arthritis. Hence, to develop new anti-rheumatic drugs it is essential that a simple in vitro method to evaluate the anti-denaturant activity of endogenous and exogenous compounds is available. We developed a new assay, using gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography, to study the effect of endogenous and exogenous compounds on heat-induced aggregation of human serum albumin in conditions in which protein precipitation does not occur. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen inhibited the aggregation of albumin at low concentrations (EC 50 10 (- 4) - 10 (- 5) mol/l) comparable to those active in a classical turbidimetric method, whereas the effect of weak stabilizers, like sodium <b>cloride</b> and formic, fumaric, maleic, malonic, and succinic acid (EC 50 10 (- 1) - 10 (- 2) mol/l in the Mizushima test) was not detectable. Furthermore, the HPLC assay allowed the examination of a number of coloured substances, including bilirubin, which appeared to be a strong stabilizer of its physiological carrier, albumin. These data could be clinically relevant, since the drugs examined are used at very high doses in rheumatoid arthritis and related conditions, with plasma levels that could cause significant stabilization of serum albumin and perhaps other proteins...|$|E
40|$|Information on the {{geography}} and environment: {{the use of}} fish poison and food containing goitrogenic subst a nce, the use of pesticide on agriculture and environment contamination of lead and mercury in relation to  Iodine Deficiency  Disorders (IDD) are discussed in this paper. Geography  location is grouped into 3 categories i. e. highland area, lowland area  and swampy land areas. Goitre prevale n ce in highland, lowland and swampy areas  were 30. 3 %, 8. 7 %, and 2. 8 % respectively. The goitre prevalence (8. 7 %) in lowland areas showed that there are pockets of goitre areas. In some coastal areas, fishermen use fish poison to kill certain fish to save the growth of milkjish from disturbance. If one consumed the death fish the level of chloride in blood will increas e and will redu ce the bi o - synthesis of thyroxine (T 4)  hormone. That is why cases of goitre were found in coastal areas. Value of urinary thiocynates {{can be used as}} indicator that one consumes goitrogenic substances i. e. cyanates. Detoxification process of cyanates produces thiocyanates. If one consumes sufficient protein containing sulphurous the cyanates will convert into thiocyanates. The use of pesticide on agriculture could be decreased the hormone cholinesterase. As goitrogenic substance residu of pesticide will lead to delay the biosynthesis of thyroxine (T 4) hormone. Research findings indicated that in lowland area of East Java that blood lead level was associated with hypothyroidism. It is assumed that contamination of lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) in water come from residual industry. It was reported from another research in Yogyakarta that women  lived in urban area who was exposured by Pb in gas emission of motor-vehicle had relatively risk suffering from hypothyroidism 4 times than those of not contaminated.   Key words: geography, environment, fish poison, <b>cloride,</b> goitrogenic substance. </p...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Sangue (heparinizado) de ratos Wistar é incubado com um extrato de hipérico, com cloreto estanoso e a seguir com Tc- 99 m, como pertecnetato de sódio (99 mTcO 4 Na). Plasma (P) e células (CS) são isolados por centrifugação. Amostras de P e CS também são precipitadas com ácido tricloroacético 5 %, e separadas as frações solúveis (FS-P e FS-CS) e insolúveis (FI-P e FI-CS). Para a análise da biodistribuição, 0, 3 mL do radiofármaco 99 mTcO 4 Na foi administrada em ratos Wistar que receberam por gavagem extrato ou salina (NaCl 0, 9 %) por 15 dias. Após 10 minutos os animais foram sacrificados e os órgãos isolados para contagem da atividade radioativa. RESULTADOS: O extrato de hipérico reduziu de forma significativa (P PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a hiperico extract (Hypericum perforatum) on the labeling of blood elements with technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) and in the bioavailability of the radiopharmaceutical sodium pertechnetate in Wistar rats. METHODS: Blood (heparinized) withdrawn from Wistar rats is incubated with a hiperico extract, with a stannous <b>cloride</b> and with 99 mTc, as sodium pertechnetate (99 mTcO 4 Na). Plasma (P) and cells (C) are isolated by centrifugation. Samples of P and C are also precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA 5 %) and soluble (FS-P; FS-C) and isoluble (FI-P; FI-C) fractions are separated. In the bioavailability analysis, the extract or NaCl 0. 9 % solution is administrated into Wistar rats (gavage) during 15 days. Sodium pertechnetate was administered and after 10 min, the animals are sacrificed, the organs were isolated, the radioactivity determined in a well counter, and the percentages of radioactivity per gram (%ATI/g) in the organs are calculated. RESULTS: The hiperico extract decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) the %ATI in the cells, cellular insoluble fraction and plasma insoluble fraction. The biodistribution was significantly (P< 0. 01) decreased in bone, muscle and thyroid and significantly (P< 0. 05) increased in pancreas. CONCLUSION: The analysis of the results indicates that in studied extract should have substances that should oxidize the stannous ion, reducing the fixation of the 99 mTc on the erythrocytes and plasma and cellular proteins. Moreover, it could produce metabolic alterations with influence in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical 99 mTcO 4 Na in bone, muscle, pancreas and thyroid...|$|E
40|$|Bicarbonate {{reabsorption}} in {{the thick}} ascending limb of Henle's loop was examined by studies of free-water clearance (CH 2 O) and free-water reabsorption (TcH 2 O). During maximal water diuresis in the dog, CH 2 O/GFR was taken as an indes of sodium reabsorption in, and urine flow (V/GFR) as an index of delivery of filtrate to, this scarbonate, infusion of a nonreabsorbable solute (hypotonic mannitol) and administration of an inhibitor of bicarbonate reabsorption (acetaent, but less than that achieved with hypotonic saline infusion. This suggests that sodium that sodium bicarbonate is not reabsorbed in the ascending limb. Rather, it is the sodium chloride, swept out of the proximal tubule by osmotic diuresis due to nonreabsorbed mannitol or sodium bicarbonate, that is reabsorbed in the ascending limb thereby increasing CH 2 O, whereas the nonreabsorption of mannitol and sodium bicarbonate results in a depressed CH 20 per unit V when compared with hypotonic saline. V/GFR is not a satisfactory index of delivery to the ascending limb during osmotic diuresis, since it includes water obligated by nonreabsorbable solutes. When a better index of delivery, {{the sum of the}} clearances of chloride (CC 1) and free-water (CH 2 O) is used, hypotonic bicarbonate infusion, hypotonic mannitol infusion and acetazolamide administration increase CH 2 O/GFR per unit delivery to the same extent as odes hypotonic saline infusion. Studies in dogs and rats on TcH 2 O also indicate that sodium bicarbonate is an impermeant solute in the ascending limb. Osmotic diuresis due to sodium bicarbonate diuresis, produced either by inhibition of sodium bicarbonate reabsorption (acetazolamide, L-lysine mono-hydrochloride) or infusion of sodium bicarbonate, or mannitol diuresis both produced marked chloruresis and increased TcH 2 O to the same extent as did hypertonic saline infusion. If chloride excretion was almost eliminated by hemodialysis against a chloride-free dialysate (dogs) or prolonged feeding of a salt-free diet (rats), TcH 2 O formation was unimpaired if hypertonic saline was infused but virtually obliterated during mannitol or sodium bicarbonate diuresis. Sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb, therefore, appears to be dependent upon chloride as the accompanying anion. At any given rate of bicarbonate excretion, more <b>cloride</b> is delivered out of the proximal tubule (as estimated from CC 1 + CH 2 O) with hypotonic sodium bicarbonate infusion than with acetazolamide administration. This suggests that magnitude of the chlorutesis accompanying bicarbonate diuresis depends, not only on osmotic diuresis due to nonreabsorbed sodium bicarbonate, but also {{on the extent to which}} concomitant changes in effective extracellular volume influence overall sodium chloride reabsorption...|$|E
40|$|External {{fixation}} {{has been}} more commonly used during the last decades for correction of bone and soft tissue deformities and in frcture healing. The most common complication of external fixation is pin site infection. Two hundred and nineteen younger and/or physically active patients (mean age 53 (18 - 75) years) suffering from knee osteoarthritis (OA) or knee deformities operated on by hemicallotasis osteotomy (HCO) were included. In paper I, a commonly used daily pin site care performed by a district nurse was compared to weekly pin site care in the outpatient clinic. Sodium chloride (9 mg/ml) was used as cleansing agent, and prophylactic antibiotics was given for 14 days. There were no differences between daily and weekly pin site care. The clinical pin site infection rate was 15 % minor infections and 30 % of the pin sites had positive bacterial cultures. The mean total use of antibiotics during the treatment period was 47 days per patient. In paper II, sodium <b>cloride</b> (9 mg/ml) was compared to chlorhexidine solution (2 mg/ml) as cleansing agent and prophylactic antibiotics were reduced to 3 days. In the chlorhexidine group there were less clinical infections, less positive cultures and lower total mean use of antibiotics {{as compared to the}} sodium group. In paper III, 3 days of prophylactic antibiotics was compared to a singgle dose. Chlorhexidine (5 mg/ml with alcohol, 70 % ethanol) was used as cleansing agent. There were no differences between 3 days and one dose of prophylactic antibiotics. In paper IV, the healing time and complications that cause longer time in external fixation were investigated in smokers and non-smokers. Smokers had longer healing time and more complications than non-smokers. Smoking was the single most important preoperative risk factor for postoperative complications. In paper V, patients suffering from knee OA were prospectively followed up during the first two years, with special focus of the treatment time in external fixation. Pain, function and knee related quality of life were assessed with the knee-specific questionnaire, Knee injury and Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The patients showed large improvements in self-rated pain, function and quality of life, most of which were seen already during the immediate postoperative period when the external fixation was still used. The clinical pin site infection rate, rate of positive cultures and total use of antibiotics could be redused by changing different factors relating to pin site care. Prolonged prophylactic antibiotics had no benefit. The negative effect of cigarette smoking is an important factor to be considered in patient selection for HCO, and should be {{an important part of the}} preoperative information. The treatment by HCO reduced the pain and improved function and quality of life already during the treatment in external fixation and continued during the 2 -year follow-up...|$|E
