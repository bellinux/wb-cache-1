5|$|As an {{offshoot}} of Boeing's MX-2145 manned boost-glide bomber project, Boeing partnered with RAND Corporation in January 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft {{would be needed to}} deliver the various nuclear weapons then under development.

40|$|Downscaled {{rainfall}} projections from 21 {{climate models}} from the CMIP 5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) archive {{are used to}} estimate future changes in rainfall erosivity in the <b>continental</b> <b>Unites</b> <b>States.</b> To estimate erosivity from rainfall {{in the absence of}} sub-hourly data, we have used both daily rainfall values and the modified Fournier index – which is based on monthly rainfall accumulation – and derived the scaling relationship between rainfall and erosivity from observational estimates of both. The expectation of overall increase in erosivity is confirmed by these calculations, but a quantitative assessment is marred by large uncertainties. Specifically, the uncertainty in the method of estimation of erosivity is more consequential than that deriving from the spread in climate simulations and leads to changes of uncertain sign in parts of the southwest and Texas. We suggest that progress can be made by establishing a more reliable functional relationship between daily rainfall and erosivity...|$|R

40|$|Spatially {{explicit}} {{projections of}} global population are of growing {{importance in the}} large-scale scenario-based assessment of, for example, the spatial distribution of land use, demand for food and water, energy usage, and emissions. In this research we present a method for producing large-scale, plausible spatial population scenarios. We begin with the assessment {{of one of the}} most sophisticated existing methodologies developed at IIASA and oriented around the gravity-based population potential model. We then propose and test significant modifications to the procedure, and apply the modified approach in a test against historical <b>United</b> <b>States</b> data. We conclude by producing a small set of 100 -year spatial scenarios for the <b>continental</b> <b>United</b> <b>Stated</b> based on the SRES A 2 storyline. We find that the IIASA methodology is subject to border effects, can produce limited patterns of spatial change, and is limited in its capacity to classify and appropriately model urban and rural patterns of change. Through the course of our work we propose modifications to address these and other problems. The unique contributions of this research include a method for calibrating the model to historical data to capture and replicate observed patterns of spatial population change and a method for removing boundary effects from a gravity-based spatial-allocation model with moving windows...|$|R
