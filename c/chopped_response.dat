The well-characterized aspect of this response consists of the activation of genes that encode protein chaperones and other ER resident proteins, and is conserved between mammals and yeast.

ER stress is also linked to the development of programmed cell death, a phenomenon in which CHOP plays an important role. Here we report on the cloning of a murine homolog of yeast IRE 1, an essential upstream component of the ER stress-response in yeast. The mammalian Ire 1 is located in the ER membrane and its over-expression in mammalian cells activates both the endogenous ER chaperone GRP 78 /BiP and CHOP-encoding genes.

40|$|Cellular stress, {{particularly}} {{in response to}} toxic and metabolic insults that perturb function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress), is a powerful inducer of the transcription factor CHOP. The role of <b>CHOP</b> in the <b>response</b> of cells to injury associated with ER stress was examined in a murine deficiency model obtained by homologous recombination at the chop gene. Compared with the wild type, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from chop −/− animals exhibited significantly less programmed cell death when challenged with agents that perturb ER function. A similar deficit in programmed cells death in response to ER stress was also observed in MEFs that lack CHOP’s major dimerization partner, C/EBPβ, implicating the CHOP–C/EBP pathway in programmed cell death. An animal model for studying the effects of <b>chop</b> on the <b>response</b> to ER stress was developed. It entailed exposing mice with defined chop genotypes to a single sublethal intraperitoneal injection of tunicamycin and resulted in a severe illness characterized by transient renal insufficiency. In chop +/+ and chop +/− mice this {{was associated with the}} early expression of CHOP in the proximal tubules followed by the development of a histological picture similar to the human condition known as acute tubular necrosis, a process that resolved by cellular regeneration. In the chop −/− animals, in spite of the severe impairment in renal function, evidence of cellular death in the kidney was reduced compared with the wild type. The proximal tubule epithelium of chop −/− animals exhibited fourfold lower levels of TUNEL-positive cells (a marker for programmed cell death), and significantly less evidence for subsequent regeneration. CHOP therefore has a role in the induction of cell death under conditions associated with malfunction of the ER and may also have a role in cellular regeneration under such circumstances...|$|R

We investigated if the loss of Klotho is causally linked to increased ER stress. Methods: We treated human renal epithelial HK- 2, alveolar epithelial A 549, HEK 293, and SH-SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells with ER stress-inducing agents, thapsigargin and/or tunicamycin. Effects of overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown of Klotho on UPR signaling was investigated by immunoblotting and Real-time PCR. Results: Elevated Klotho levels in HK- 2 cells decreased expression of ER stress markers phospho-IRE 1, XBP- 1 s, BiP, CHOP, pJNK, and phospho-p 38, {{all of which were}} elevated in response to tunicamycin and/or thapsigargin.

Previously, CHOP was shown to comprise extensive disordered regions and to self-associate in solution. In the current study, the intrinsically disordered nature of this protein was characterized further by comprehensive in silico analyses. Using circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance, we investigated the global conformation and secondary structure of CHOP and demonstrated, for the first time, that conformational changes in this protein can be induced by the free amino acid l-cysteine. Addition of l-cysteine caused a significant dose-dependent decrease in the protein helicity – dropping from 69. 1 % to 23. 8 % {{in the presence of}} 1 mM of l-cysteine – and a sequential transition to a more disordered state, unlike that caused by thermal denaturation. Furthermore, the presence of small amounts of free amino acid (80 µM, an 8 ∶ 1 cysteine∶CHOP ratio) during CHOP thermal denaturation altered the molecular mechanism of its melting process, leading to a complex, multi-step transition. On the other hand, high levels (4 mM) of free l-cysteine seemed to cause a complete loss of rigid cooperatively melting structure.

It was recently shown that the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) promotes early cytokine-induced inflammation in the β cell. DHS catalyzes the conversion of lysine to hypusine, an amino acid that is unique to the translational elongation factor eIF 5 A. Here, we sought to determine whether DHS activity contributes to β cell dysfunction in models of type 2 diabetes in mice and β cell lines. A 2 -week treatment of obese diabetic C 57 BLKS/J-db/db mice with the DHS inhibitor GC 7 resulted in improved glucose tolerance, increased insulin release, and enhanced β cell mass. Thapsigargin treatment of β cells in vitro induces a picture of ER stress and apoptosis similar to that seen in db/db mice; in this setting, DHS inhibition led to a block in CHOP (CAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein) production despite > 30 -fold activation of Chop gene transcription. Blockage of CHOP translation resulted in reduction of downstream caspase- 3 cleavage and near-complete protection of cells from apoptotic death. DHS inhibition appeared to prevent the cytoplasmic co-localization of eIF 5 A with the ER, possibly precluding the participation of eIF 5 A in translational elongation at ER-based ribosomes.

This study investigated the mechanism of apoptosis induced by the purine-scaffold Hsp 90 inhibitor PU-H 71 in different human cancer cell lines and examined the role of Bcl- 2 and Bax in this process. We demonstrated that Hsp 90 inhibition by PU-H 71 generated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) as evidenced by XBP 1 mRNA splicing and up-regulation of Grp 94, Grp 78, ATF 4 and <b>CHOP.</b> In <b>response</b> to PU-H 71 -induced ER stress, apoptosis was triggered in melanoma, cervix, colon, liver and lung cancer cells, but not in normal human fibroblasts. Apoptosis was executed through the mitochondrial pathway as shown by down-regulation of Bcl- 2, up-regulation and activation of Bax, permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes, release of cytochrome c and activation of caspases. We also found that, in contrast to the ER stressor thapsigargin, PU-H 71 induced apoptosis in cells overexpressing Bcl- 2 and thus overcame the resistance conferred by this anti-apoptotic protein. In addition, although Bax deficiency rendered cells resistant to PU-H 71, combined treatment with the anticancer drugs cisplatin or melphalan greatly sensitized these cells to PU-H 71. Taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of Hsp 90 by PU-H 71 is a promising strategy for cancer treatment, particularly in the case of tumors resistant to conventional chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of Type 1 {{diabetes}} pro-inflammatory cytokines (e. g. IL- 1 β, IFN-γ and TNF-α) produced by islet-infiltrating immune cells modify expression of key gene networks in β-cells, leading to local inflammation and β-cell apoptosis. Most known cytokine-induced transcription factors have pro-apoptotic effects, and little is known regarding "protective" transcription factors. To this end, we presently evaluated {{the role of the}} transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta (C/EBPδ) on β-cell apoptosis and production of inflammatory mediators in the rat insulinoma INS- 1 E cells, in purified primary rat β-cells and in human islets. C/EBPδ is expressed and up-regulated in response to the cytokines IL- 1 β and IFN-γ in rat β-cells and human islets. Small interfering RNA-mediated C/EBPδ silencing exacerbated IL- 1 β+IFN-γ-induced caspase 9 and 3 cleavage and apoptosis in these cells. C/EBPδ deficiency increased the up-regulation of the transcription factor <b>CHOP</b> in <b>response</b> to cytokines, enhancing expression of the pro-apoptotic Bcl- 2 family member BIM. Interfering with C/EBPδ and CHOP or C/EBPδ and BIM in double knockdown approaches abrogated the exacerbating effects of C/EBPδ deficiency on cytokine-induced β-cell apoptosis, while C/EBPδ overexpression inhibited BIM expression and partially protected β-cells against IL- 1 β+IFN-γ-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, C/EBPδ silencing boosted cytokine-induced production of the chemokines CXCL 1, 9, 10 and CCL 20 in β-cells by hampering IRF- 1 up-regulation and increasing STAT 1 activation in response to cytokines. These observations identify a novel function of C/EBPδ as a modulatory transcription factor that inhibits the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory gene networks activated by cytokines in pancreatic β-cells.

40|$|For a {{long period}} of time, the {{transcription}} factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) has been thought to inhibit transcriptional activity for its ability to interact with CCAAT enhancer-binding protein family factors, thus preventing their binding to DNA. We have previously shown that in human T lymphocytes the CHOP phosphorylation induced by prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) -increased interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) gene expression. Given the CHOP positive role in the regulation of transcription, here we have investigated the molecular mechanism(s) by which CHOP increases IL- 8 gene activity under PGE 2 stimulus. Transfection experiments with mutants showed both that the CHOP transactivation domain is essential for IL- 8 transcription and that the IL- 8 /activator protein 1 (AP- 1) promoter mutated in NF-κB and NF-IL- 6, but not in the AP- 1 site, harbors essential CHOP-responsive elements. CHOP silencing confirmed its role in the IL- 8 transcriptional regulation and protein production, whereas c-Jun small interfering RNA experiments showed that the PGE 2 -induced activation of IL- 8 promoter is mainly c-Jun-independent. Moreover, PGE 2 induced CHOP-DNA complexes only when the entire IL- 8 /AP- 1 promoter or the wild type sequences encompassing the AP- 1 upstream region were employed. Mutations introduced in these sequences prevented the DNA-CHOP complex formation. The IL- 8 /AP- 1 mutant promoter lacking the sequence immediately upstream the AP- 1 site is PGE 2 -unresponsive. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation data confirmed in vivo that PGE 2 induces CHOP binding to the IL- 8 promoter.

Therefore, such patients are potential candidates for early bone marrow transplantation. METHODS: To investigate whether patients with slow responses, defined as only a partial response after three courses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), would benefit from early transplantation, we conducted a prospective, randomized trial. The early application of high-dose chemoradiotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation was compared with the continuation of CHOP therapy for another five courses. Patients with complete responses after three courses of <b>CHOP</b> (fast <b>responses)</b> and patients who responded partially but still had tumor-positive marrow continued with another five courses of CHOP. The study end points were the response rate, overall survival, disease-free survival, and event-free survival. RESULTS: Of 286 patients who could be evaluated for the rapidity of their response after three courses of CHOP, 38 percent had fast responses, 47 percent had slow responses, and 15 percent had no response. Among 106 patients with slow responses who had lymphoma-negative marrow, 69 patients (65 percent) were randomized. Seventy-four percent of the CHOP group and 68 percent of the transplantation group had complete remissions (P = 0. 54).

One of the regulators of endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated cell death is the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (Chop). We presently studied the molecular regulation of Chop expression in insulin-producing cells (INS- 1 E) in response to three pro-apoptotic and endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducing agents, namely the cytokines interleukin- 1 beta + interferon-gamma, the free fatty acid palmitate, and the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum pump Ca(2 +) ATPase blocker cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). Detailed mutagenesis studies of the Chop promoter showed differential regulation of Chop transcription by CPA, cytokines, and palmitate. Whereas palmitate- and cytokine-induced Chop expression was mediated via a C/EBP-activating transcription factor (ATF) composite and AP- 1 binding sites, CPA induction required the C/EBP-ATF site and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response element. Cytokines, palmitate, and CPA induced eIF 2 alpha phosphorylation in INS- 1 E cells leading to activation of the transcription factor ATF 4. <b>Chop</b> transcription in <b>response</b> to cytokines and palmitate depends on the binding of ATF 4 and AP- 1 to the Chop promoter, but distinct AP- 1 dimers were formed by cytokines and palmitate.

We ascertained that overexpression of Nck 1 antagonizes ER stress-mediated inhibition of translation by decreasing phosphorylation of eIF 2 beta on Ser 51 by the PERK ser/thr protein kinase. In this thesis, I determined that Nck overexpression prevents the induction of ATF 4 and CHOP genes associated with eIF 2 beta phosphorylation in ER stress conditions. Conversely, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically deficient of Nck 1 and Nck 2 genes (Nck 1 -/-Nck 2 -/-) show increased levels of ATF 4, GADD 34 and <b>CHOP</b> in <b>response</b> to ER stress, further supporting a role for Nck in regulating the translational arm of the UPR. Concurrently, I found that Nck adaptors localize at the ER and {{are part of an}} eIF 2 beta holophosphatase complex containing PP 1 c, a ser/thr phosphatase that dephosphorylates eIF 2 beta on Ser 51. Unexpectedly, however, I observed that RNA interference (RNAi) -mediated Nck 1 depletion results in decreased levels of eIF 2 beta phosphorylation and GADD 34 induction in ER-stressed cells. Moreover, I uncovered a direct and SH 2 -mediated interaction between Nck and PERK. I provided strong evidence that PERK is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vitro and demonstrated that Tyr 561 located in PERK juxtamembrane domain is virtually essential for the association with Nck adaptors. Therefore, I proposed that during the process of PERK activation, Tyr 561 is phosphorylated and creates a binding site for Nck adaptors. I hypothesized that Nck is required for proper targeting and phosphorylation of eIF 2 beta by PERK. To demonstrate this in vivo, I took advantage that obesity in mice causes ER stress in specific tissues. My data validate my hypothesis as eIF 2 beta phosphorylation levels in liver and adipose tissue of obese mice were decreased by 45 % in mice genetically inactivated of the nck 1 gene. Characterization of glucose homeostasis in normal and obese Nck-/- and Nck 2 -/- knockout mice revealed marked alteration in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared to controls, thereby shedding light on a new physiological function for these signaling adaptors in controlling glycaemia in vivo...|$|R

First published May 17, 2016; doi: 10. 1152 /ajplung. 00064. 2016. —Diesel emissions {{are the main}} source of air pollution in urban areas, and diesel exposure is linked with substantial adverse health effects. In vitro diesel exposure models are considered a suitable tool for understanding these effects. Here we aimed to use a controlled in vitro exposure system to whole diesel exhaust to study the effect of whole diesel exhaust concentration and exposure duration on mucociliary differentiated human primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC). PBEC cultured at the air-liquid interface were exposed for 60 to 375 min to three different dilutions of diesel exhaust (DE). The DE mixture was generated by an engine at 47 % load, and characterized for particulate matter size and distribution and chemical and gas composition. Cytotoxicity and epithelial barrier function was assessed, as well as mRNA expression and protein release analysis. DE caused a significant dose-dependent increase in expression of oxidative stress markers (HMOX 1 and NQO 1; n 5 4) at 6 h after 150 min exposure. Furthermore, DE significantly increased the expression of the markers of the integrated stress <b>response</b> <b>CHOP</b> and GADD 34 and of the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL 8, as well as release of CXCL 8 protein. Cytotoxic effects or effects on epithelial barrier function were observed only after prolonged exposures to the highest DE dose. These results demonstrate the suitability of our model and that exposure dose and duration and time of analysis postexposure are main determinants for the effects of DE on differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells...|$|R
40|$|Background: Exacerbations {{constitute}} {{a major cause}} of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Both bacterial infections, such as those with non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), and exposures to diesel engine emissions are known to contribute to exacerbations in COPD patients. However, the effect of diesel exhaust (DE) exposure on the epithelial response to microbial stimulation is incompletely understood, and possible differences in the response to DE of epithelial cells from COPD patients and controls have not been studied. Methods: Primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC) were obtained from age-matched COPD patients (n = 7) and controls (n = 5). PBEC were cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI) to achieve mucociliary differentiation. ALI-PBECs were apically exposed for 1 h to a stream of freshly generated whole DE or air. Exposure was followed by 3 h incubation in presence or absence of UV-inactivated NTHi before analysis of epithelial gene expression. Results: DE alone induced an increase in markers of oxidative stress (HMOX 1, 50 - 100 -fold) and of the integrated stress <b>response</b> (<b>CHOP,</b> 1. 5 - 2 -fold and GADD 34, 1. 5 -fold) in cells from both COPD patients and controls. Exposure of COPD cultures to DE followed by NTHi caused an additive increase in GADD 34 expression (up to 3 -fold). Importantly, DE caused an inhibition of the NTHi-induced expression of the antimicrobial peptide S 100 A 7, and of the chaperone protein HSP 5 A/BiP. Conclusions: Our findings show that DE exposure of differentiated primary airway epithelial cells causes activation of the gene expression of HMOX 1 and markers of integrated stress response to a similar extent in cells from COPD donors and controls. Furthermore, DE further increased the NTHi-induced expression of GADD 34, indicating a possible enhancement of the integrated stress response. DE reduced the NTHi-induced expression of S 100 A 7. These data suggest that DE exposure may cause adverse health effects in part by decreasing host defense against infection and by modulating stress responses. © 2017 The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Introduction 					Excess C/EBP {{homologous}} protein (CHOP) expression is one {{feature of the}} unfolded protein response (UPR) to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here, we focused on CHOP expression and function in chondrocytes. 				 				 					 						Methods 					We studied human knee osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage, bovine chondrocytes cultured in alginate and subjected to sub-lethal biomechanical injury, and knee chondrocytes of human autopsy donors. We performed siRNA knockdown and transfection. 				 				 					 						Results 					UPR activation was increased in human knee OA cartilage in situ, and in biomechanically injured cultured chondrocytes in vitro. In normal human chondrocytes, CHOP &# 8220;gain of function&# 8221; sensitized chondrocytes to IL- 1 &# 946; induced nitric oxide (NO) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 3 release without inducing these responses by itself. Excess CHOP expression, by itself, induced superoxide production and apoptosis. Conversely, siRNA knockdown of CHOP and the UPR-specific mediator X-box binding protein (XBP 1) inhibited NO release by > 80 % (P < 0. 0005) in response to IL- 1 &# 946;, and blunted MMP- 3 release, whereas there were only minimal effects of the UPR mediator GRP 78 on these responses. The anti-inflammatory metabolic &# 8220;super-regulator&# 8221; AMP kinase (AMPK) is known to limit UPR activation in vascular muscle cells. Here, CHOP supported the capacity of IL- 1 &# 946; to suppress AMPK activity in chondrocytes. We also observed that inhibition of AMPK activity promoted an increase in chondrocyte CHOP expression. Conversely, pharmacologic activation of AMPK by 5 -Aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) blunted chondrocyte <b>CHOP</b> expression in <b>response</b> to biomechanical injury. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Biomechanical injury and IL- 1 signaling stimulate UPR activation in chondrocytes. CHOP mediates chondrocyte catabolic and apoptotic responses to IL- 1 &# 946;, and does so partly by inhibiting AMPK activity. Conversely, development of excess CHOP activity is limited by AMPK activity in chondrocytes. Our findings suggest a mechanism for potential chondroprotection by AICAR and other AMPK activators. The work is of translational relevance for OA, since several drugs that activate AMPK {{are already in the}} clinic for arthritis (for example, allosteric AMPK activators sodium salicylate and high dose aspirin, and methotrexate, which activates AMPK by generating AICAR) ...|$|R
40|$|Lovastatin, a {{competitive}} inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, is commonly prescribed {{for the treatment}} of hypercholesterolemia. More recently lovastatin has demonstrated an ability to induce tumour specific apoptosis however the mechanism by which lovastatin exerts this activity is not well characterized. End products of the mevalonate pathway are critical for various cellular functions including N-linked protein glycosylation, tRNA production, and the prenylation {{of a wide variety of}} cellular proteins among them many GTP-binding proteins which regulate cell proliferation, intracellular trafficking, and cell motility. Blockade of the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as statins, results in decreased levels of mevalonate and its downstream products and thus may have significant influences on many critical cellular functions. This study demonstrates that the loss of key downstream mevalonate pathway metabolites leads to the activation of the cellular stress response known as the integrated stress response regulating lovastatin induced apoptosis in sensitive cell lines including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), SCC 25. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a signaling pathway, activated in response to a variety of different cellular stresses, that induces a common set of genes involved in cellular signaling leading to phosphorylation and inactivation of translation initiation factor, eIF 2 -alpha. The expression levels of several known mediators of the ISR were studied at both transcriptional and translational levels in response to lovastatin treatment. Lovastatin treatment induced eIF 2 -alpha phosphorylation and inhibited global protein translation. ATF 4 expression was also induced, as well as increased ATF 3 and CHOP expression (targets ofATF 4) in sensitive cell lines only. In CHOP (-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), lovastatin-induced apoptosis was attenuated indicating a role for <b>CHOP</b> in this <b>response.</b> Furthermore, the eIF 2 -alpha kinase, GCN 2, mediates induction ofATF 4 and lovastatin-induced apoptosis was also attenuated in GCN 2 (-/-) MEFs. Our analysis revealed that lovastatin induced cytotoxicity directly correlates with induction of ISR markers ATF 4, CHOP and ATF 3 in sensitive cell lines. ATF 3 is a transcription factor with dual oncogenic or tumour suppressor roles within the context of carcinogenesis and depending on the stressor can be induced during the ISR. Examining the role ofATF 3 within the lovastatin induced cell death revealed that expression ofGCN 2 kinase and ATF 4 are essential for its induction. In ATF 3 (-/-) MEFs, lovastatin-induced apoptosis was attenuated and induction of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor, CHOP, as well as its nuclear translocation was impaired. Consistently, depletion of atf 3 mRNA in two different cancer cell lines confers them partial protection against lovastatin induced apoptosis. Our analysis shows that GADD 34, a target gene of CHOP required for de-phosphorylation of eIF 2 -alpha, was also induced by lovastatin treatment and abrogating the function of GADD 34 by means of salubrinal, a specific inhibitor ofGADD 34 phosphatase activity, strongly enhanced cytotoxicity of low doses of lovastatin in MEFs and SCC 25 cells and also strongly increased ATF 3 expression levels. Therefore, combining mevalonate pathway inhibitors with agents that enhance the ISR represent a novel combinational therapeutic approach...|$|R
40|$|Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic pulmonary disease of unknown origin with an unavoidable fatal outcome. In principle, IPF {{is characterized by}} alveolar epithelial cell damage, increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the lung interstitium, and enhanced fibroblast/myofibroblast proliferation and activation. These processes ultimately lead to distortion of normal lung architecture and loss of respiratory function. Recent data show that Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells type II (AECII) {{play a key role}} in both, sporadic and familial forms of IPF. It has been shown that an overload and accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins lead to ER stress. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is thought to represent a key regulator of pro-apoptotic responses under ER stress. In IPF, induction and nuclear translocation of CHOP in AECII is regularly found, to a weaker extent also in yet not fibrotic areas of these lungs. Following this line, we hypothesized that ER stress-induced CHOP may significantly contribute to AECII injury and apoptosis and hence fibrosis development in IPF. The present study therefore aimed to (i) characterize the transcriptional regulation of epithelial CHOP expression in vitro, and (ii) to elucidate the biological role of Chop in the induction of epithelial apoptosis and lung fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. For such purpose, the promotor of the human CHOP gene was extensively analyzed employing a luciferase reporter gene assay. We identified a new mechanism for the regulation of CHOP expression during ER stress. According to our data, Ap- 1 and c-Ets- 1 transcription factors are up-regulated in the lung epithelium under ER-stress conditions, interact with each other and jointly bind to the Chop promotor, thereby inducing the Chop gene expression. Moreover, the role of Chop in the induction of epithelial apoptosis was studied using various in vitro and in vivo models. Exclusive Chop overexpression was achieved in vitro using an inducible "Tetracyclin-On" ("Tet-on") -system in stably transfected epithelial MLE 12 cells and in isolated, primary alveolar type II cells. Both in vitro models revealed induction of cleaved caspase 3 and thus apoptosis in <b>response</b> to <b>Chop</b> overexpression. In addition, incubation of murine lung fibroblasts with supernatants of these stably transfected cells resulted in increased fibroblast proliferation once Chop was induced by doxycyclin application. Moreover, in vivo data support the results of in vitro studies. Conditional Chop overexpression in AECII in vivo was achieved by crossing SP-C rtTA to tetO 7 <b>Chop</b> mice. In <b>response</b> to oral doxycyclin feeding, Chop was induced in AECII and led to Caspase 3 cleavage and thus apoptosis of these cells. Furthermore, induction and up-regulation of Chop target genes such as Casp 11, Il 1 b, Il 6, Ero 1 a, Dr 5, and Gadd 34 was detected on mRNA level by qPCR. In short term periods covering 8 weeks, young transgenic mice with inducible, AECII-specific Chop overexpression did yet not show a distinct fibrotic phenotype, although we could detect significant up-regulation of pro-fibrotic markers. Thus, involvement of Chop in the development of lung fibrosis requires further investigation. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that AP- 1 and c-Ets- 1 play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of CHOP expression during ER stress. Additionally, we provide evidence that Chop expression alone is sufficient to induce apoptosis in AECII and consecutive fibroproliferation, hence suggesting a pivotal role of CHOP in the pathogenesis of {{pulmonary fibrosis}}. Die idiopathische pulmonale Fibrose (IPF) ist eine schwerwiegende, progressive Lungenerkrankung unbekannter Genese, die auch heute noch eine unbefriedigende Überlebenszeit aufweist. Die IPF ist durch eine chronische Schädigung und exzessive Apoptose von alveolären Typ II Zellen (AECII), durch exzessive Ablagerung von extrazellulärer Matrix im Lungeninterstitium, und durch eine gesteigerte Aktivierung und Proliferation von Fibroblasten und Myofibroblasten charakterisiert. Diese Prozesse führen durch den progressiven Ersatz der normalen Lungenstruktur durch fibrotisches Bindegewebe zu einer Zerstörung der zarten Alveolar-Struktur, und hierdurch zu der klinisch im Vordergrund stehenden Verschlechterung des Gasaustausches und der Lungendehnbarkeit (Compliance). Neueren Untersuchungen zufolge stellt ein Endoplasmatischer Retikulum (ER) -Stress mit konsekutiver Apoptose eine Hauptursache für die Schädigung und die Apoptose der AECII bei familiären und sporadischen Formen der IPF dar. In der Vergangenheit konnte bereits gezeigt werden, dass Proteinüberladung und Anhäufung von ungefalteten und missgefalteten Proteinen im ER zu schwerem ER-Stress führt. C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) könnte hierbei eine wichtige Rolle bei der Aktivierung von ER-Stress-induzierten Apoptose-Signalwegen spielen, und somit zu ER-Stress vermittelten Erkrankungen führen. In IPF-Lungen ist die vermehrte Expression und nukleäre Translokation von CHOP in AECII eindeutig nachweisbar, in vermindertem Umfang auch in noch nicht fibrotisch umgebauten Arealen dieser Lungen. Wir verfolgten daher die Hypothese, dass die ER-Stress-induzierte AECII-Apoptose in IPF Lungen hauptsächlich durch CHOP vermittelt wird. Die Ziele in dieser Doktorarbeit waren daher i) die vollständige Aufklärung der transkriptionalen Regulation der epithelialen CHOP Expression in vitro, und ii) die Aufdeckung der biologischen Rolle der CHOP-Überexpression bei der Induktion von alveolär-epithelialer Apoptose und Lungenfibrose in vitro und in vivo. In dieser Arbeit wurde der Promotor des humanen CHOP-Gens extensiv durch Luziferase-Reportergen-Assays analysiert, und dabei konnte ein neuer, bisher noch nicht beschriebener Mechanismus für die Regulation der CHOP-Expression unter ER-Stress Bedingungen identifiziert werden. So konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Transkriptionsfaktoren Ap- 1 und c-Ets- 1 im Lungenepithel unter ER-Stress-Konditionen hochreguliert werden, dabei in Interaktion miteinander an den murinen CHOP-Promotor binden, und auf diese Weise die Chop-Expression induzieren. Die Beteiligung von Chop in der Induktion der alveolär-epithelialen Apoptose wurde anhand vielfältiger in vitro- und in vivo-Modelle untersucht. So wurde die Überexpression von Chop in vitro sowohl mit einem induzierbarem "Tetracyclin-On" ("Tet-On") -Expressionssystem in stabil transfizierten alveolär-epithelialen MLE 12 -Zellen als auch in isolierten, primären transformierten AECII direkt untersucht. Beide in vitro-Systeme zeigten Kaspase- 3 -Aktivierung und -Spaltung nach Überexpression von Chop. Zudem wurde eine Chop-abhängige, gesteigerte Proliferation von murinen Lungenfibroblasten beobachtet, nachdem diese mit Kulturüberstanden der epithelialen in vitro Modelle inkubiert wurden. Weiterhin wurden diese in vitro-Resultate durch die Ergebnisse von in vivo-Experimenten unterstützt. So resultierte die konditionale Chop-Überexpression in AECII in einem transgenen Maus-Modell (SP-C rtTA / tetO 7 Chop) in vivo ebenfalls in einer Induktion von Kaspase- 3 -Spaltung und somit der Apoptose dieser Zellen. Zusätzlich wurde eine Induktion und Hochregulation der Chop-Targetgene Casp 11, Il 1 b, Il 6, Ero 1 a, Dr 5 und Gadd 34 auf Transkriptebene durch qPCR beobachtet. Im Kurzzeitexperiment von 8 Wochen zeigten diese transgenen jungen Mäuse mit konditionaler, AECII-spezifischer Überexpression von Chop (noch) keine Entwicklung von Lungenfibrose, obwohl profibrotische Gene in den Maus-Lungen signifikant hochreguliert waren. Daher sind zusätzliche Untersuchungen nötig, um die Involvierung von Chop bei der Entwicklung von Lungenfibrose zu klären. Zusammenfassend konnte in dieser Doktorarbeit zum ersten Mal gezeigt werden, dass AP- 1 und c-Ets- 1 eine bedeutende Rolle in der transkriptionalen Regulation der CHOP-Expression während ER-Stress spielen. Zusätzlich konnte bewiesen werden, dass die alleinige Expression von Chop ausreicht um AECII in die Apoptose zu treiben und nachgeschaltet eine Fibroseantwort in vitro zu provozieren. Diese Ergebnisse zeigen daher eindeutig, dass CHOP eine bedeutende Rolle in der Pathogenese der Lungenfibrose spielt...|$|R
