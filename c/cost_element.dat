Overheads are the expenditure which cannot be conveniently traced to or identified with any particular cost unit. Therefore, overheads cannot be immediately associated with the products or services being offered, thus do not directly generate profits. However, overheads are still vital to business operations as they provide critical support for the business to carry out profit making activities. For example, overhead costs such as the rent for a factory allows workers to manufacture products which can then be sold for a profit. Such expenses are incurred for output generally and not for particular work order; e.g., wages paid to watch and ward staff, heating and lighting expenses of factory, etc. Overheads are also very important <b>cost</b> <b>element</b> along with direct materials and direct labor.|$|E

40|$|Architecture trade studies {{require that}} {{multiple}} cost models from various options be compiled and compared to determine relative cost advantages. The time-evolution of full life-cycle costs through implementation and maintenance/operations phases must be modeled. The effect of risk on cost {{must also be}} taken into account. Finally, the statistical significance of cost differences must be assessed. This paper describes the methods used for a recent study of future architectures for NASA’s communications network. Typical results are presented. Time-evolution is implemented by creating a separate WBS for each time period in the study, and then inserting/removing <b>cost</b> <b>elements</b> at appropriate times. Cost roll-ups at any level can then be shown as a function of time. Costs for different options are created by selecting and scaling <b>cost</b> <b>elements</b> from a common library. <b>Cost</b> <b>elements</b> can have up to four different types of cost: implementation, maintenance, sustainment and operations. Cost types are treated differently in time according to user defined models. Each <b>cost</b> in each <b>element</b> is assigned a mean and variance. Random analysis is then used to determine cost distributions, while the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test is used to determine whether similar distributions for different options are statistically distinct. Risk is taken into account by defining risk events applied to individual <b>cost</b> <b>elements</b> or to WBS elements at particular times. Depending on the likelihood and severity of the risks, and where they occur in the WBS, cost distributions can be far from Gaussian. Models can be complex, so model debugging tools are also supplied.

His insight was that the essential <b>cost</b> <b>element</b> of large area solar arrays was glass, and he could treat the actual solar cell as simply {{a different kind of}} coating on glass. After doing little except absorbing $12 million cash, McMaster gave up on the amorphous silicon research, offered to pay back the 57 investors who followed him into solar cells. He then raised yet another $15 million to create Solar Cells Inc., to work on a different thin-film technology, cadmium telluride photovoltaics. By 1997, Solar Cells had a prototype production machine. In 1995, he brought in a new president, and bought still more stock in the company to fund research, although the company had yet to pay a dividend. According to Ken Zweibel, former head of the Thin Film Partnership program at the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory, SCI was clearly the industry leader in thin-film photovoltaic technology.

It had by than access to the newly build railway line which connects Hannover with Kassel, about 3 km away. Consequently, in 1883 the canal was widened east of the present village square in Sülbeck to build a little harbor. The area has been built over since 2010. At first the barges were hauled up the canal by horses. In 1886 a small tug was obtained that towed the barges loaded with coal from Salzderhelden to Sülbeck. Two locks were built on the Salzgraben to bridge the height difference between Leine and Salzgraben close to the outflow back into the Leine river. Later the first tug [...] "Theodor" [...] was exchanged against the stronger [...] "Grubenhagen". After an arial cableway had been built the traffic with barges was given up. The rudder of one of the barges is preserved in the museum. The Salzgraben was filled in during the 1970s during the construction of the flood retention basin Salzderhelden.|$|E

40|$|Today's typical {{probabilistic}} {{cost analysis}} assumes an ''ideal'' project that is devoid {{of the human}} and organizational considerations that heavily influence the success and cost of real-world projects. In the real world ''Money Allocated Is Money Spent'' (MAIMS principle); cost underruns are rarely available to protect against cost overruns while task overruns are {{passed on to the}} total project cost. Realistic cost estimates therefore require a modified probabilistic cost analysis that simultaneously models the cost management strategy including budget allocation. Psychological influences such as overconfidence in assessing uncertainties and dependencies among <b>cost</b> <b>elements</b> and risks are other important considerations that are generally not addressed. It should then be no surprise that actual project costs often exceed the initial estimates and are delivered late and/or with a reduced scope. This paper presents a practical probabilistic cost analysis model that incorporates recent findings in human behavior and judgment under uncertainty, dependencies among <b>cost</b> <b>elements,</b> the MAIMS principle, and project management practices. Uncertain <b>cost</b> <b>elements</b> are elicited from experts using the direct fractile assessment method and fitted with three-parameter Weibull distributions. The full correlation matrix is specified in terms of two parameters that characterize correlations among <b>cost</b> <b>elements</b> in the same and in different subsystems. The analysis is readily implemented using standard Monte Carlo simulation tools such as {at}Risk and Crystal Ball{reg_sign}. The analysis of a representative design and engineering project substantiates that today's typical probabilistic cost analysis is likely to severely underestimate project cost for probability of success values of importance to contractors and procuring activities. The proposed approach provides a framework for developing a viable cost management strategy for allocating baseline budgets and contingencies. Given the scope and magnitude of the cost-overrun problem, the benefits are likely to be significant...|$|R
50|$|Sonigistix {{started out}} as a project out of the UBC Electrical Engineering company and existed for two years on the UBC campus. Its founder was Brent Bolleman and its first raison d'être was to refine and market an {{electrostatic}} computer product based on the design of Quad Electrostatics. Electrostatic speakers have their own problems due to the need for the membrane requiring high voltage, which is dangerous and has the requirement of a step up transformer, which is costly. The ultimate desire was to have a speaker that looked great and sounded great, so the conversion to planar magnetic design, which had problems of its own but easier dealt with, most notably was the need for rare earth magnets, which were expensive. Much of the focus of the transition focused on how to reduce this <b>cost</b> <b>element</b> and make the speakers more appealing to a larger pool of consumers.

In practice however, the fact that financial return is still a project’s top priority for many, environmental aspects tend to be overlooked or considered as a burden, as they add to project costs. Sustainability and its implications have a far-reaching effect on each project over time. Therefore, with highway infrastructure’s long-term life span and huge capital demand, the consideration of environmental cost/ benefit issues is more crucial in life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA). To date, there is little in existing literature studies on viable estimation methods for environmental costs.
