5|$|A {{configuration}} in Rule 90 can be partitioned {{into two}} subsets of cells {{that do not}} interact with each other. One of these two subsets consists of the <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> even positions at even time steps and the <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> odd positions in odd time steps. The other subset consists of the <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> even positions at odd time steps and the <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> odd positions at even time steps. Each of these two subsets {{can be viewed as}} a cellular automaton with only its half of the cells.|$|E
5|$|Patterns in Rule 184 {{typically}} quickly stabilize, {{either to}} {{a pattern in}} which the cell states move in lockstep one position leftwards at each step, or to a pattern that moves one position rightwards at each step. Specifically, if the initial density of cells with state 1 is less than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> state 1, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> state 0. Patterns of this type move rightwards. If, on the other hand, the initial density is greater than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> state 0, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> state 1, and patterns of this type move leftwards. If the density is exactly 50%, the initial pattern stabilizes (more slowly) to a pattern that can equivalently be viewed as moving either leftwards or rightwards at each step: an alternating sequence of 0s and 1s.|$|E
5|$|A uniform {{honeycomb}} in hyperbolic {{space is}} a uniform tessellation of uniform polyhedral <b>cells.</b> <b>In</b> 3-dimensional hyperbolic space {{there are nine}} Coxeter group families of compact convex uniform honeycombs, generated as Wythoff constructions, and represented by permutations of rings of the Coxeter diagrams for each family.|$|E

50|$|The spinocervical pathway is a four-neuron, fast-conducting, tactile/pressure pathway {{from the}} spinal cord to sensory cortex.

5|$|Basket <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> CA3 receive {{excitatory}} {{input from the}} pyramidal cells and then give an inhibitory feedback to the pyramidal cells. This recurrent inhibition is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen excitatory responses in the hippocampus. The pyramidal cells gives a recurrent excitation which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing microcircuits.|$|E
5|$|Because viruses use vital {{metabolic}} pathways within host {{cells to}} replicate, they {{are difficult to}} eliminate without using drugs that cause toxic effects to host <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> general. The most effective medical approaches to viral diseases are vaccinations to provide immunity to infection, and antiviral drugs that selectively interfere with viral replication.|$|E
5|$|Both H.repandum and {{the variety}} album contain the diepoxide {{compound}} repandiol (2R,3R,8R,9R)-4,6-decadiyne-2,3:8,9-diepoxy-1,10-diol), which {{was shown to}} have potent cytotoxic activity against various tumor <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> laboratory culture. At the molecular level, repandiol is an alkylating agent. It inserts crosslinks between strands of DNA, {{making it difficult for}} the genetic material to be expressed or replicated.|$|E
50|$|The {{tetrahedral}} cells may {{be divided}} into two groups, of 96 cells and 24 cells respectively.

5|$|Even {{more complex}} {{morphological}} changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, Myxobacteria detect surrounding <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> {{a process known}} as quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial <b>cells.</b> <b>In</b> these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of multicellular organisation. For example, about one in ten cells migrate {{to the top of a}} fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.|$|E
