Until the mid-1980s, the central two letters signified the armed service, or the branch or <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle.</b> For example, Chief of Fleet Support's staff car in 1983–85 was 00RN04, and First Sea Lord's car 00RN01 and Second Sea Lord's 00RN02, normal civilian plates replacing them when security required; and, in 1970, one of 's Land Rovers was 25RN97 and 's ship's minibus was 04RN84.

50|$|The lukewarm {{reception}} to the R-Class in Canada and the United States {{was similar}} to the poor sales of the Chrysler Pacifica, a large crossover produced from 2003 to 2007 by Mercedes-Benz's parent DaimlerChrysler, under the Chrysler division. Like the Pacifica, the R-Class is supposed to share the attributes of the minivan, SUV, and a wagon. Similar to Chrysler's marketing of the Pacifica which was unsuccessful, Mercedes was unable to convince the public that the R-Class was a pioneer of new <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle,</b> as consumers preferred more traditional SUV-style crossovers. Despite the R-Class being more upscale and sophisticated (compared to the Pacifica's minivan platform) with a better executed launch (while the Pacifica was plagued with production and marketing flaws), it has sold poorly compared to the GLK and M-Classes. Due to low sales, the R-Class was discontinued after the 2012 model year in the United States (Discontinued after 2013 in Europe) and was replaced by the second generation GL/GLS Class and the Mercedes Benz Metris.|$|E

5000|$|The Statesman was {{intended}} as a rival for Ford Australia's successful Fairlane which had debuted in Australian-designed form as the ZA series in March 1967. The Fairlane had created a new and exclusive category of Australian-made prestige cars. It was derived from the Falcon, with an extended wheelbase and unique front-end and rear-end styling to differentiate the car's appearance. At the time, this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> proved to be very profitable, in that the sale price was significantly higher than the base car from which the prestige model was derived, and the additional costs of production were only moderate. GM-H went to some length to set the new luxury Statesman marque apart from the Holden equivalent in their sales literature. for the new models, totally avoiding the presence of the name [...] "Holden", even to the extent of using the term [...] "General Motors" [...] in lieu of [...] "General Motors-Holden's".

50|$|Because of the {{proliferation}} of such systems in the Alpine regions of Europe, the French and German names, téléphérique and Seilbahn, respectively, are often also used in an English language context. Cable car is the usual term in British English, as in British English the word tramway generally refers to a railed street tramway while in American English, cable car may additionally refer to a cable-pulled street tramway with detachable vehicles; e.g., San Francisco's cable cars. As such, careful phrasing is necessary to prevent confusion. It is also sometimes called a ropeway or even incorrectly {{referred to as a}} gondola lift. A gondola lift has cabins suspended from a continuously circulating cable whereas aerial trams simply shuttle back and forth on cables. In Japan, the two are considered as the same <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> and called ropeway, while the term cable car means Cable car (railway) and funicular. An aerial railway where the vehicles are suspended from a fixed track (as opposed to a cable) is known as a suspension railway.|$|E
50|$|Positioned {{as a large}} crossover, the Pacifica was {{designed}} to combine the convenience of a minivan, the elevated position of an SUV, and the handling of a sedan, as the minivan's popularity was being eclipsed by the SUV which in turn lost favor due to high gas prices. Compared to traditional (light-truck based) luxury sport utility vehicles such as the Lincoln Navigator, the Pacifica had less heavy cargo-hauling and towing capacity but otherwise it was superior in handling, comfort, interior, and amenities. Crossovers with three-row seating tend to be inferior to minivans in passenger room; the Pacifica was no exception as its third-row seats were considered too small {{compared to that of}} the Chrysler Town & Country which was less expensive and more fuel-efficient. However other luxury automakers have no minivans in most of their lineups which avoids cannibalization of the sales of their large crossovers, so it didn't help that the Pacifica inevitably drew comparisons to the Town & Country. Furthermore, DaimlerChrysler was unable to convince the public that the Pacifica was a pioneer of new <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle,</b> as consumers preferred more traditional SUV-style crossovers, and they faced the same problem with the release of the 2006 Mercedes-Benz R-Class in 2005. Like the Pacifica the R-Class is supposed to share the attributes of the minivan, SUV, and a wagon, and despite the R-Class being more upscale and sophisticated (based on a rear-wheel drive platform) with a better executed launch (while the Pacifica was plagued with production and marketing flaws), it has sold poorly compared to the GLK and M-Classes.|$|E
40|$|The recogniseability of {{vehicles}} {{can be much}} improved by standardisation of their illumination. In particular the standardisation of the rear-lights of cars, trucks, lorries and bicycles is important {{from the point of}} view of road safety. The conspicuousness of all vehicles can be improved when vehicles have their lights on during daylight. These are the main conclusions of research aimed at reducing front-rear collisions and collisions with parked vehicles. It is suggested that vehicles should be subdivided into seven categories. Bicycles should have a red rear light and a yellow one below it. On cars the rear lights must be placed as far as possible from each other. Lorries and trucks should have four red rear lights. Signal lights on cars should be divided, in particular braking and rear lights. standardisation of an emergency-stop signal is suggested.
