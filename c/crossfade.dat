5|$|The author Mark Lewisohn {{reports that}} the Beatles held their first and only 24-hour session at Abbey Road {{near the end of}} the {{creation}} of The Beatles, which occurred during the final mixing and sequencing for the album. The session was attended by Lennon, McCartney and producer George Martin. Unlike most LPs, there was no customary three-second gap between tracks, and the master was edited so that songs segued together, via a straight edit, a <b>crossfade,</b> or an incidental piece of music.|$|E
5|$|FreeStyleGames {{teamed up}} with London based music {{production}} company <b>Crossfade</b> Cartel owned by Ofei Sakyi and Dan Neil to ensure {{the overall quality of}} the soundtrack. The 16 man music production team used a combination of MIDI software along with the music sequencer program, Ableton Live; the MIDI information was used to construct the gameplay elements such as crossfading and scratching with additional custom export software. Because of this nature, Neil stated that it was much easier to alter a mix to meet certain gameplay goals, taking only a few minutes to complete, compared with the development of songs for Guitar Hero.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero 2 is {{the sequel}} to DJ Hero, a spinoff of the Guitar Hero series. DJ Hero 2 was {{developed}} by FreeStyleGames, published by Activision and released worldwide in October 2010 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii consoles. Like its predecessor, DJ Hero 2 simulates turntablism, the playing of two songs in mix, using a special turntable-based controller that includes the ability to <b>crossfade</b> between the two songs, and scratching the recording. Players are challenged to match these actions, shown through on-screen scrolling indicators in synchronization with the mix; correct actions boost the player's score, while correctly performing several consecutive actions can increase the player's scoring multiplier. Specifically marked sections of songs allow the player to freestyle through crossfading, scratching, or inserting music samples into the mix. The player is not penalized for failing to perform actions. The goal is to obtain a high score for each mix, earning the player a star rating from one to five, which helps to advance the player's progress through the game.|$|E

40|$|Binaural {{synthesis}} of complex, dynamic acoustic scenes requires multiple convolution processes with time-varying head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). To avoid audible artifacts, this requires {{not only a}} position-dependent interpolation of HRTFs, but also smooth transitions during filter changes. Existing solutions either use gradual interpolation of filter coefficients or <b>crossfading</b> of filter outputs. This paper proposes a <b>crossfading</b> method that operates in the frequency domain, which enables integration with fast frequency-domain techniques such as overlap&save, uniformly or non-uniformly partitioned convolution. Fading is performed by circular convolution with a frequency-domain window function. A method is proposed to design such windows {{with only a few}} non-zero coefficients, resulting in significant complexity reductions compared to existing <b>crossfading</b> techniques. Further substantial efficiency improvements are achieved by integrating the proposed <b>crossfading</b> method into binaural rendering systems...|$|R

25|$|Newer {{portable}} media {{players are}} now coming with Internet access via Wi-Fi. Examples of such devices are Android OS devices by various manufacturers, and iOS devices on Apple products like the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. Internet access has even enabled {{people to use}} the Internet as an underlying communications layer for their choice of music for automated music randomisation services like Pandora, to on-demand video access (which also has music available) such as YouTube. This technology has enabled casual and hobbyist DJs to cue their tracks from a smaller package from an Internet connection, sometimes they will use two identical devices on a <b>crossfade</b> mixer.

30|$|Most {{existing}} work {{on automatic}} DJ systems focuses on optimizing individual <b>crossfades</b> by minimizing {{the amount of}} discomfort. However, {{there are still some}} important limitations to these systems. First of all, the <b>crossfading</b> process often remains very simple, e.g., without performing any equalization. Secondly, very few systems consider the high-level structural properties of the mixed audio. Thirdly, the focus is usually on optimizing individual <b>crossfades,</b> but the global song progression throughout the mix is not considered. In general, {{there appears to be no}} complete integrated DJing system in scientific literature that elegantly combines all necessary components and considers DJing best practices to create enjoyable music mixes.|$|R

Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song {{is going to be}} some kind of sermon, but there's a lot of social and political things that I don't think make it gospel or Christian music." [...] He also stated, [...] "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist. If I never been homeless, let me try to be homeless for a week and soak up that information. More like a method actor. So for me it's spending time with people and talking about things from their perspective." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar to DJ Hero, {{players in}} DJ Hero 2 follow {{specific}} {{actions on the}} turntable controller in time to marked scrolling indicators on the game's screen, earning points for correctly performing actions in time. The game includes a new freestyle mode, giving the player the chance to freely <b>crossfade</b> between tracks, scratch a section of a mix, or add sample effects during marked sections. [...] The game features 83 mixes on disc comprising over 100 different songs, with further mixes available as downloadable content. Most mixes have been assembled by FreeStyleGames, but other professional DJs, including David Guetta, deadmau5, DJ Qbert, TiÃ«sto and RZA, have provided both their mixing skills and character avatar for the game. Players can challenge these mixes {{at any time in}} a Quickplay mode, progress through them in the single-player Empire mode, or play cooperatively or competitively with a second user in offline and online game modes. A third player can also participate through singing the mix' vocals.|$|E
500|$|DJ Hero has {{received}} positive reviews from the gaming press, who consider the title as a fresh restart {{of the music}} genre given {{the large number of}} titles based on guitar play. The turntable peripheral was considered to be well designed {{to meet the needs of}} the game. The unit's weight, size, and shape, and ability to cater to both left- and right-handed players was commended. Many reviewers noted a need to alter the action of the crossfader, either by having better physical feedback to the player to indicate the center of the knob's track, or by reducing the width of the track to better handle the rapid <b>crossfade</b> maneuvers. Reviewers also noted that there was a certain weight to the turntable portion of the controller which made scratching imprecise, particularly with the inner blue button where only minimal torque can be applied. The learning curve of the game across the various mixes was highly commended by reviewers for helping players to get used to the new controller. When progressing from [...] "Medium" [...] to [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Expert" [...] levels and encountering more complex mixes, reviewers thought the game felt transformed, bringing a difficult but more rewarding experience to the player as they begin emulating every part of a real DJ's motions. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer considered that while the learning curve is steep, with the [...] "Easy" [...] difficulty being [...] "less thrilling and engaging" [...] compared to Guitar Hero, the game was [...] "structured fabulously to nudge you gradually closer to the summit" [...] with each successive career set and difficulty mode. Cam Shae of IGN Australia felt that the changes in [...] "Hard" [...] mode over [...] "Medium" [...] were somewhat excessive, introducing both more <b>crossfade</b> effects and button-pressing, and felt these could have been introduced separately in [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Expert" [...] modes. [...] Richard Li of 1UP.com noted that the inability to fail a song is both [...] "a bane and a boon"; newer players would not feel frustration at trying to get used to the controller and would be able to quickly unlock all the sets in the game's career mode, but without knowing where they failed, they would not have an idea of where they need to hone their skills to improve their performance at the game. The omission of a practice mode was noted by Daemon Hatfield of IGN, believing it would help in some of the more complex mixes by the DJ celebrities. Reviewers believed that the small faults in DJ Hero can be easily fixed for potential sequels.|$|E

500|$|DJ Hero 2 {{follows from}} its {{predecessor}} in simulating {{the performance of}} a disc jockey mixing one or two songs using a special turntable controller. The controller, the same unit as shipped previously with DJ Hero, includes a rotatable turntable to use for recording scratching, three [...] "stream" [...] buttons to match notes from the two music tracks and an effects track, and a slider to control the <b>crossfade</b> between tracks. These actions are presented to the players through on-screen notation that scrolls in time with the music. Players score points by performing the actions correctly, but are not penalized otherwise. By successfully completing a consecutive set of actions, the player can increase their scoring multiplier up to 4x; the multiplier returns to 1x should they miss any actions. Certain marked sections, when played correctly, fill a [...] "Euphoria" [...] (the [...] "Star Power" [...] for this game) meter which can be unleashed using another button on the controller and will temporarily double the scoring. The player can also earn the ability to rewind a song by a few seconds by playing a long string of consecutive notes. They can rewind the song by quickly spinning the turntable in reverse; the rewind effect can be used to either correct a mistake or further boost one's scoring.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written and {{recorded}} during the album's sessions at Windmill Lane Studios and The Factory Studios in Dublin, between {{legs of the}} Zoo TV Tour from March to May 1993. [...] "Zooropa" [...] was first developed after The Edge listened to cassette recordings of the band's soundchecks from the tour. [...] Along with the album's sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy, The Edge edited {{the best parts of}} the soundchecks to create a song arrangement, which served as a backing track. The song's introduction was recorded separately from the remainder of the song. [...] The band based the introduction on a jam session in the studio, and producer Flood took parts of the jam and created an ambient mix. The bass guitar during the intro was written and performed by drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., {{who came up with the}} piece during the recording sessions while The Edge was working on the album's guitar riffs. The song pieces were then edited into a stereo mix, with the intro mixed in by Flood using a <b>crossfade.</b> Synthesizer sounds were added by producer Brian Eno on a Yamaha DX7 keyboard, including a [...] "squishy, mad-synth sound" [...] that connected the different segments of the soundcheck. The Edge later added guitar tracks, as well as additional sounds to the song using an EMS SynthiA synthesiser. Once the song was almost finished, the band had doubts about the first segment of the soundcheck backing track. Having established an arrangement for the song, they performed it in the studio from start to finish and used the replaying for the first part of the soundcheck backing track, while using portions of the new performance for the second segment.|$|E
