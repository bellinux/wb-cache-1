5|$|A {{gristmill}} {{built at}} the mouth of the creek was one of the first manufacturing buildings on the West Branch Susquehanna River upstream of Big Island. In 1864 a large sawmill was <b>constructed</b> <b>on</b> Tangascootack Creek a short distance above the mouth and several years later a shingle mill was built in the area. The sawmill was also expanded and six dams were <b>constructed</b> <b>on</b> the creek. The total cost of this project was $100,000. Agriculture was another industry that was practiced in the area of the creek in the early 1900s. In 1859 the Sunbury and Erie Railroad went into the creek's valley.|$|E

Barrack blocks were <b>constructed</b> <b>on</b> the rest of the peninsula in the early 20th century.|$|E
