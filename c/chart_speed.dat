40|$|Typical {{recorders}} {{commonly used}} now in Japan to record low speed phenomena have chart speeds of several centimeters per hour. These chart speeds are convenient to see daily variations such as earth tides, {{but are not}} adequate {{for the purpose of}} glancing the variations of longer periods. In order to see directly the secular variations of very slowly progressing phenomena such as crustal movements, a recording system which has ultra-low <b>chart</b> <b>speed</b> (several cm/month) and ultra-low frequency characteristics was developed. The method adopted here is to plot the sum of the data which was sampled in the past 24 hours, while the recorder is driven intermittently. The features of this system are as follows: (1) Owing to its ultra-low <b>chart</b> <b>speed,</b> we can directly see the progress of the phenomena within a few days or a few months. This may offer useful information for the short period earthquake prediction. (2) Owing to its ultra-low frequency characteristics, we can pick up the signals which are buried in daily disturbances of large amplitudes. (3) Owing to the durability of the recording chart, we can be free from frequent maintenance of the system. (4) As the system is constructed by use of a microprocessor, we will be easily able to correspond to future demands such as improvement of the data-smoothing algorithm...|$|E
40|$|A {{test was}} {{conducted}} to make {{a check on the}} yield stress of the copper spacer buttons to be used in OCH. The tested button was made from Copper no. 110, cold drawn rod, which has a documented yield stress value of 48, 000 psi. The button was put into compression with the load applied to the face of the button. The resulting deflection vs. the applied cross load was then charted with the width of the chart having a 10, 000 kg scale. While the <b>chart</b> <b>speed</b> was set at 1 cm/min, the cross head speed was set at. 05 cm/min. To find a value of Young's Modulus for the OCH button, the compression test was run again with a chart width scale of 5, 000 kg. The <b>chart</b> <b>speed</b> was set at 10 cm/min and the cross head speed at. 05 cm/min. The curve generated on the chart was linear in nature until the button reached its yield point. Here, the slope of the curve began to change, increasing over a small area until a new linear curve was established. The point at which the slope changed would be considered the yielding point of the material, but here, there was no single distinct point. Instead there was a smooth transition between the two linear portions of the curve. In order to find where the yield point would occur, two lines were drawn, representing the best fit of each of the two slopes of the curve (before and after the yield point). The intersection of these lines was taken to be the point from which the yield stress could be calculated...|$|E

One or more aligned segments submerged in aerated buffer pushed an Al foil shutter over a slit of light incident on a photodetector such as a solar or photronic cell, connected directly to a recorder, or a photomultiplier tube in a commercial photometer. Convenient kinetic records were obtained at 5 mm per min <b>chart</b> <b>speed</b> when one segment was combined with a 1 -mm long slit, or more segments and longer slits, for which a 1 -mm chart unit usually exceeded noise and was equivalent to 4 μm growth per cm coleoptile.

40|$|Abstract- In this study, the {{mechanical}} behaviour of rubber seed was determined {{in terms of}} compressive force, stress, energy, deformation and elastic modulus at four levels of moisture content ranging from 9. 1 to 14. 8 % (w. b.), using the Universal Tensile Testing Machine, under compressive loading, with loading range (0 - 500 N), <b>chart</b> <b>speed</b> (50 rpm/mm) and cross head speed (1. 5 mm/min) as testing conditions. The optimum peak values of force, stress, energy, deformation and elastic modulus at 14. 8 % (w. b.) moisture content were 164. 35 ± 66. 09 N, 2. 09 ± 0. 59 N/mm 2, 0. 27 ± 0. 07 Nm, 2. 74 ± 0. 51 mm and 7. 77 ± 3. 85 N/mm 2, respectively. Beyond elastic limit, the force of compression decreased quadratically with increase in deformation with high coefficient of determination (significant p < 0. 05). Predictive equations were derived to relate the force and deformation at peak and break stages of compression. It was deduced from these equations that rubber seed will continue to flow pass 2. 40 mm peak with decrease in force until 3. 10 mm when {{it is expected to}} break. The results showed that rubber seed combined the properties of viscosity and elasticity when subjected to compressive loading...|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{monitoring}} of the fetal heart rate (FHR) for diagnosing fetal distress during labor has made great progress {{in the past ten}} years. We now know that fetal well-being is reflected by absence of heart rate deceleration, maintenance of beat-to-beat fluctuation, and normal baseline level. 1. 1 Subjective classifications Many authors [l, 2, 4, 16] have tried to classify FHR patterns into different categories in attempts, to help in the detect on of early Symptoms of fetal distress. All known classi-fications have the same flaw: they are subjective and could be interpreted differently. On the other hand, the appearence of fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns also depends on the Strip <b>chart</b> <b>speed</b> and the scale. Moreover the prognostic significance of these classifications appears to be a relatively weak one and fetal distress has been reported in cases of Dip I or early decelaration. The physiopathologic meaning of these various types of classification is also question-able. The Information derived from such fetal heart rate recordings is qualitative and is difficult to correlate with quantitative clinical and bio-logical findings. 1. 2 Objective data Since 1967, SUREAU [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] has ad^ vocated the usefulness of quantifying FHR recordings in order to obtain objective con^ densed and numerical data concerning fetal Curriculum vitae G.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 04 - 07, 1991 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaChart {{recorders}} {{are needed}} both for producing a permanent record for post-mission analysis and for providing real-time information during a test. Immediate feedback is important when test conditions may require mid-course warnings or corrections. In the traditional galvanometer based chart recorder, the operator can {{look directly at}} the pens moving on the paper and quickly judge speed and amplitude. When using a thermal array recorder, {{there is a small}} delay between the time of printing and the time when the trace is visible. This is due to the construction of the thermal array itself. Individual printing elements are deposited on a ceramic substrate which eliminates all motion from the printing process and physically blocks the operator’s view of the printhead so that for a short time there are no visual clues as to the exact waveform position. At higher <b>chart</b> <b>speed</b> this gap only represents milliseconds of elapsed time, well below human reaction time, and therefore of no real importance. At trending speeds, however, the delay could be half a second or even more and could be a problem in some situations. The first solution offered by manufacturers of thermal array recorders was a row of LED’s that stretched across the recorder directly over the printheads and reflected printing activity in real-time and indicated the actual position of the individual waveform traces. This was found to be a satisfactory solution by most telemetrists who wanted to change to the new technology in order {{to take advantage of the}} thermal array recorder’s higher frequency response and flexible formats. While the LED array satisfies basic real-time response requirements, there are many other applications for auxiliary displays which include variable chart labeling and graphic display of waveforms...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{measurement}} {{is vital}} to the operation of interstates, providing feedback on performance and identifying areas for improvement. An FHWA rule based on the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century (MAP- 21) and Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act requires agencies to implement performance measurement for interstates. One area in particular need of performance measurement is winter operations, which the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) spends up to $ 60 million on each year. Crowdsourced probe vehicle speed data offers broad coverage of the network without the need for physical infrastructure. However, with approximately 2, 677 segment speeds reported at one minute intervals on the Indiana Interstate network, probe data generates 3. 8 million records per day and 1. 4 billion records per year that require substantial processing to provide real-time information. ^ This contribution of this dissertation is the definition of a series of dashboards and associated processing techniques that provide graphical illustration of interstate performance in many dimensions and a set of quantitative winter operations performance measures that fuse speed and weather data. The dashboards consist of a set of longitudinal dashboards that <b>chart</b> <b>speed</b> ranges, queuing, and travel time, for individual routes or corridors. The Traffic Ticker provides a statewide view of congestion over time, broken down by district, route, and speed. Finally, the Weather Ticker uses both speed and weather data to monitor conditions by snow routes at the district level. The performance metrics, including measures such as time to recovery and storm duration, are integrated with the tool for ease of use by managers. ^ Several case studies are presented, including a major interstate detour, crashes, snow storms, and an ice storm. The range of events portrays the usefulness of the tools and performance measures for after-action review, which can be applied for training and planning for future events. Real-time monitoring with these tools, as shown in the detour case, can allow INDOT to respond to conditions as they develop and mitigate congestion. The dashboards allow for performance measurement with greater resolution and ease than previously available, and the fusion of traffic and weather data allows for a quantitative view of winter operations. ...|$|E

50|$|Commercial {{and naval}} fathometers of yesteryear used a strip chart {{recorder}} where an advancing roll of paper was marked by a stylus to make a permanent copy of the depth, usually with some means of also recording time (Each mark or time 'tic' is proportional to distance traveled) so that the strip charts could be readily compared to navigation charts and maneuvering logs (speed changes). Much of the world's ocean depths have been mapped using such recording strips. Fathometers of this type usually offered multiple (<b>chart</b> advance) <b>speed</b> settings, and sometimes, multiple frequencies as well. (Deep Ocean—Low Frequency carries better, Shallows—high frequency shows smaller structures (like fish, submerged reefs, wrecks, or other bottom composition features of interest.)
