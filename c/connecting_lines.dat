5|$|The Marshlink Action Group is a {{volunteer}} group {{set up in}} 2003 {{in the interests of}} passengers using the line. The group are concerned about its facilities, particularly the use of Class 171 DMUs when all <b>connecting</b> <b>lines</b> have been electrified. They have reported a high proportion of children and the elderly use the line compared to others in the south east, and that trains are now at capacity but there is no additional stock because of its state as an isolated non-electric line. In 2016, Rudd chaired a working group to look at short and long-term plans for upgrading the Marshlink line, including the potential accommodation of Class 395 rolling stock.|$|E

25|$|<b>Connecting</b> <b>lines</b> and {{stations}} {{were closed and}} evacuated.

25|$|A {{proposal}} {{was made to}} apply for Parliamentary powers to construct a line along Canton Road, but as a similar scheme had {{been included in the}} Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Tramways Company Bill, this was amended to a proposal to construct <b>connecting</b> <b>lines</b> comprising a single line along Handel Street and curves into Canton Road from Bath Street.|$|E

50|$|A {{special feature}} of the network are the level {{crossings}} where the trams cross the standard gauge non-electrified Mühlkreisbahn railway and its <b>connecting</b> <b>line</b> to the main Austrian Federal Railways network. Lines 1 and 2 cross the <b>connecting</b> <b>line</b> {{to the east of}} Linz Urfahr railway station, whilst line 50 crosses the Mühlkreisbahn proper to the west of that station. The <b>connecting</b> <b>line</b> itself has some of the attributes of a tramway, running in the carriageway of a road during its crossing of the Danube on the so-called Eisenbahnbrücke.|$|R

25|$|In the {{language}} of tensor algebra, a particular tensor {{is associated with a}} particular shape with many lines projecting upwards and downwards, corresponding to abstract upper and lower indices of tensors respectively. <b>Connecting</b> <b>lines</b> between two shapes corresponds to contraction of indices. One advantage of this notation is that one does not have to invent new letters for new indices. This notation is also explicitly basis-independent.|$|E
25|$|Schemes in the London area {{generally}} {{used the}} four-rail system in use by tube and sub-surface railways (such as the Metropolitan Railway). Lines from Bow to Barking, Euston to Watford Junction, Broad Street to Richmond {{and a number}} of related branches and <b>connecting</b> <b>lines</b> were already electrified when the LMS came into existence, although the LMS did extend electrification from Barking to Upminster in 1932.|$|E
25|$|Besides this, {{most of the}} {{stations}} have connections with different bus lines. At the same time, Urbinaga Station was built {{with the intention of}} <b>connecting</b> <b>lines</b> C1 and C2 of Cercanías and Ansio Station with a bus terminal. However, these connection projects have not been finished as of 2011. Eventually the Urbinaga project was restarted in 2009. That future intermodal station will also take advantage of the future Leioa-Urbinaga Tram. Its construction was expected to start at the end of 2009.|$|E

25|$|The Kilmarnock and Troon Railway {{was a local}} line, and as larger {{concerns}} {{extended their}} area of influence, the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK) leased the line from 1846, and built <b>connecting</b> <b>lines</b> so that it became {{an integral part of}} their network. The alignment at the second Laigh Milton Viaduct was still unsatisfactory and in 1865 a third viaduct was built further south. The GPK was taken over by the Glasgow and South Western Railway and the line remains in use today (2013), owned by Network Rail. Passenger and freight trains operate over the route.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{forms of}} the letters in antiquity are {{majuscule}} forms. Besides the upright, straight inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for handwriting on soft materials were also developed during antiquity. Such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in Egypt since the Hellenistic period. Ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: uncial writing, with carefully drawn, rounded block letters of about equal size, used as a book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and cursive writing, used for everyday purposes. The cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and descenders, {{as well as many}} <b>connecting</b> <b>lines</b> and ligatures between letters.|$|E
25|$|Realizing {{that the}} New York Central now {{depended}} heavily on <b>connecting</b> <b>lines</b> to reach Midwestern cities like Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and St. Louis, Vanderbilt decided to add Amasa Stone to the Central's board of directors. Stone was first {{appointed to the}} board in 1867, and probably served until December 1868. In April 1868, Stone {{played a major role}} in bringing together Cornelius Vanderbilt and the oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. Vanderbilt very much wanted the New York Central to carry both raw and refined oil being shipped by Rockefeller. On April 18, 1868, Vanderbilt asked Rockefeller (then visiting New York City) to meet with him. Rockefeller refused, sending only his business card. He believed Vanderbilt would try to charge him high freightage rates, and Rockefeller knew he could get his oil to refineries and consumers without Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt persisted, however, and later that afternoon sent Amasa Stone to visit Rockefeller at Rockefeller's hotel. The two Clevelanders spoke for several hours, and Stone convinced Rockefeller to see Vanderbilt. The two men met that evening, and began a long and fruitful business relationship.|$|E

500|$|A {{station was}} first opened on this site by the North Union Railway in 1838. It was {{extended}} in 1850 with new platforms under the separate {{management of the}} East Lancashire Railway, and by 1863, LondonScotland trains stopped here to allow passengers {{to eat in the}} station dining room. The current station was built 1880 and extended in 1903 and 1913, when it had fifteen platforms. A free buffet for servicemen was provided during both World Wars. The [...] "East Lancashire" [...] platforms were demolished in the 1970s as <b>connecting</b> <b>lines</b> closed. Only six platforms remain in regular use today.|$|E
500|$|The {{painting}} contains several geometric constructions. The {{roof of the}} shed's trusses form {{series of}} triangles <b>connecting</b> <b>lines</b> joining {{the base of the}} pedestals and the crossbeams. These surround the gathering of the Holy Family, who form an inverse pattern. According to art historian Lawrence Steefel, [...] "the detail participates in an almost emblematic pattern of repeated triangles which establish a rhyme scheme above and below, of roof structure and figure disposition." [...] Upton writes that a [...] "clearly defined diamond" [...] is visible within the apex in the roof. From there it extends down to Eve, and the bottom apex is formed where the infant lies on the ground. It then extends up to Adam and back up to the roof. [...] "This diamond shape," [...] he writes, [...] "supplemented by the rectangle within it, formed by the shed supports, the base of the triangle and the ground line in the shed, circumscribes the main event of the painting." ...|$|E
