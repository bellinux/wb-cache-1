Static normal load was induced at the contact between the coating and an AISI 52100 ball for a certain duration. It was identified that plastically deformed contact area increased logarithmically {{as a function of}} time when the contact was under static normal load. Fretting tests after various durations of static contact were conducted using a ball-on-flat plate apparatus. All fretting tests were halted when the friction coefficient reached a critical value of 0. 5, indicating complete coating failure. The total number of fretting cycles to the critical friction coefficient was found to vary with the duration of static contact before fretting. It was identified that the number of cycles to the critical friction coefficient decreased with the increased duration of static contact. Meanwhile, the friction coefficient at steady-state sliding was not greatly affected by the duration of static contact before fretting. Finally, the relation between coating thickness after indentation creep and the number of cycles to the critical friction coefficient was found to be linear.

Use of carbon steel or mild steel as a construction material is taken as an onus despite its poor corrosion resistance properties at ambient temperature. This is because of its abundance, easy availability, low cost, good formability and workability and remarkable strength. The corrosion in steel structures is generally controlled by 3 methods, viz., <b>cathodic</b> protection, <b>coating</b> or use of an inhibitor. For pipe lines, storage tanks or similar structures, silicate or silicate based materials {{have been used as}} inhibitor for more than 70 years.

40|$|The disbondment of {{protective}} organic coatings under excessive cathodic protection potentials {{is a widely}} reported coating failure mechanism. Traditional methods of evaluating cathodic disbondment are based on ex situ visual inspection of coated metal surfaces after being exposed to standard cathodic disbondment testing conditions {{for a long period}} of time. Although electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been employed as an effective means of evaluating various anti-corrosion properties of organic coatings; its application for assessing the cathodic disbondment resistance of coatings has not been sufficiently exploited.

A clear correlation between EIS parameters and the disbonded coating areas has been confirmed upon short term exposure of epoxy-coated steel electrodes to cathodic disbondment conditions; however the degree of this correlation was found to decrease with the extension of exposure duration.

This study includes various standard steel and aluminium substrates as well as new substrate materials, e. g. HDG steel with zinc-magnesium and coil coatings with corrosion protection primer. The mutual influence of substrate, pretreatment and EC is investigated and possible failure mechanisms are related to the layer properties. Some results of these investigations are presented. They include the new VDA/VDEh cyclic corrosion test (VDA 233 - 102) and its correlation to the anti-corrosion behaviour at intensified outdoor weathering. ln addition, other tests, like the constant climate test with temperature gradient, electro-chemical methods, among others EIS and SKP and studies of the reversibility of water uptake of the EC-coated substrate-pretreatment systems are performed to study the behaviour of the different materials and pretreatments in combination with EC. The interfaces of interest are between metaland conversion layer and/or conversion layer and organic coating. Surface and interfacial studies with FIB/SEM/EDX are applied to understand changes after different loadings and mechanisms related to corrosion behaviour. These studies will offer insights into the performance of these systems and will help to identify strengths and weaknesses of specific combinations of the new pretreatment technologies with (new) substrate materials. Up to now, most investigated systems show good performance in electrochemical tests which is in good accordance with the results of VDA 233 - 102. The high electrochemical homogeneity from SKP results in high barrier properties of the systems. After loading with thermo cyclic stress, most of the systems keep their high barrier function even near the glass transition temperature of the EC. ln water uptake reversibility studies, differences between the systems especially for zinc magnesium (ZM) and aluminium (Al) are observed. The ranking of the reversibility at 20 °C and 80 °C is not the same for the pretreatments. For steel and galvanized steel the performance of water uptake reversibility is in the same range for all investigated pretreatments. For ZM and Al the performance of the pretreatments strongly depends on the temperature and no correlation to barrier properties can be drawn. For some systems continuous condensation results indicate a weakening in adhesion, but the weakened systems still show good barrier properties and good water uptake reversibility.

After the exposure period, cleaning process for all specimens follows prior to the final analysis. Corrosion rates were calculated using weight loss methods for all of the specimens. Magnesium sacrificial anode gives better protection to the steel pipe compare to the zinc anode. The result of the corrosion rate for cathodically protected coated steel pipe by using magnesium anode was lowest which is 0. 80 mpy compared to the cathodically protected coated steel pipe with sacrificial zinc anode, the corrosion rate is 2. 32 mpy. The result for coated steel pipe without using any anode is 2. 71 mpy. The magnesium anode performance yield similar result to the cathodicaly protected for uncoated steel pipe.
