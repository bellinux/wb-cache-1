Additionally, many will also offer telephone ordering and mobile phone apps, or at least provide telephone sales support. The advent of mobile web has made businesses operating <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> businesses especially popular, because it means customers can do tasks like shopping when they have spare time {{and do not have}} to be at a computer.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the strategic utilization of electronic commerce by traditional supermarkets through strategic alliance with Internet based companies. The paper explores how a <b>clicks</b> <b>and</b> <b>bricks</b> alliance can transform the traditional marketplace; from re-engineering their business processes, to enhancing the <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> mortar retailers business models, and further contributing to changes in the market structure. Thus by re-engineering their business process to allow enhanced business models, they will be able to improve their overall performance and thus gain competitive advantage. From the research undertaken, this paper draws conclusions on both <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> <b>clicks</b> benefits <b>and</b> how these alliances fit into the broader context of the business strategy of the traditional supermarket...|$|R

This e-boutique is a showplace with the world’s first virtual rail. The rail is created by three 46 -inch video screens and three physical rails of clothing, with constant updates, that showcase the latest trends. Customers can place orders for free delivery to the store through in-store order points and style advisers who are equipped with iPads. Customers are offered the latest fashions in a store with a smaller footprint and the shopping experience is brought with mobile and online sites (FierceRetail, 2013). The situational evolution of fashion retail access bound by time and space to its ubiquitous access is demonstrated by iBeacon and Brouha. These location-based technology apps deliver real-time retailer messages to customers. As customers shop in the store, they receive a stream of details about shopping deals and events, products, and other helpful time-sensitive information directly to their devices (Morning News USA, 2013).|$|R

Products are now increasingly sold online and not just confined to local stores as in the traditional <b>brick</b> <b>and</b> mortar firms. The brick & click model helps web marketers by combining online capabilities with the traditional bricks-and-mortar firms. This paper will {{keep an eye on}} the <b>brick</b> <b>and</b> <b>click</b> model as an important tool for the marketers for technology driven consumers who want goods conveniently and easily at their doorsteps. With an increase in number of online users and products offered online the collaboration of a web marketer through partnership or joint venture as in <b>brick</b> <b>and</b> <b>click</b> firms prove more profitable in terms of wider coverage and economies of scale.

40|$|In information-based {{industries}} like insurance, {{the greater}} connectivity {{offered by the}} Internet offers significant opportunities to reduce costs, increase speed of response and improve supply chain co-operation. Capitalising on these opportunities may depend upon the way that business processes for e-commerce are integrated with existing business processes. This paper reports findings from case studies of three major UK-based insurance companies incorporating e-commerce within their business-to-business operations. It looks at four questions: (1) what are the key features of the business model adopted for clicks-and-mortar e-commerce; (2) {{to what extent are}} ?<b>clicks?</b> <b>and</b> ?<b>bricks?</b> business processes <b>and</b> information systems integrated; (3) how are companies managing the way that ?clicks? processes are integrated with ?<b>bricks?</b> processes; <b>and</b> (4) what are the key issues arising from the integration process? All three companies have had to contend with a conservative industry culture and a lack of industry standards in attempting to integrate e-commerce within existing business processes. The companies are either attempting to fully integrate e-operations into existing processes, or they are keeping them quite separate. In either case, the conservative industry culture acts as a brake on greater integration, with the result that IT associated with e-commerce is most often being used to automate, rather than redesign, existing business processes...|$|R
40|$|E-tailing {{is gaining}} {{momentum}} in Australia as traditional retailers are moving towards {{the adoption of}} a <b>clicks</b> <b>and</b> <b>bricks</b> strategy. Electronic retailing or E-tailing can be described as selling goods to customers directly through electronic means. Although this Business-to-Consumer phenomenon is not new, it is helping retailers to conduct business online with virtual storefronts and to reach local and global customers who are disadvantaged by geographical and other distinct barriers. This chapter starts by detailing the current state of e-tailing with supporting statistical figures from recent research with a specific emphasis on Australia. Overall growth in Internet accessibility rates across Australia clearly demonstrate e-tailing’s importance to online customers. Literature review once again proves the fact that Internet not only creates opportunities for retailers but also poses many challenges. Further discussion provides an understanding of the suitability of the retailing channel for different products and services. This study then analyses the usability of Australia’s top twenty-five retailers’ websites focussing on website usability factors, such as navigation, searchability, purchasing, layout and clarity, information content, and web browser compatibility. Australia’s e-tailing initiatives might be lagging behind most developed markets, however recent research indicates that there is a significant growth in this online activity and it will continue to attract more and more online customers in the coming years as retailers jump on the e-tailing bandwagon...|$|R

The meeting sought to determine whether educational buildings and ICT should continue to be seen as separate entities competing for the same funds, or whether they should be treated as one holistic component of educational infrastructure. The international seminar, held in Brisbane, Australia, in March 2003, concentrated primarily on vocational training and higher educational buildings. The seminar presented benefits of integrated capital planning strategies, taking into account life cycle expectancies and ICT advances such as online delivery; modes of knowledge production and flexible delivery; government policies and implications for planners; and implications for policy-makers.

40|$|There is {{some debate}} {{concerning}} the relative {{environmental impacts of}} online shopping (<b>clicks)</b> <b>and</b> conventional shopping (<b>bricks)</b> (Sui <b>and</b> Rejeski, 2002; Abukhader and Jonson, 2003; Hesse, 2002). With e-tail spending in general having increased by over 400 % in the last 4 years and 17. 5 % of all retail spending now taking place online (IMRG, 2008), {{it is important to}} understand the environmental consequences of this shift in purchasing behaviour. The debate is particularly fierce in the groceries sector, with several of the large British supermarkets proclaiming the environmental benefits of their online operations. The truth behind these claims is very difficult to assess because of the complexity of the “last mile ” issues involved in comparing groceries sold online and conventionally. In order to gain an insight into the travel issues associated with online and conventional grocery shopping, a survey was carried out on the students of Heriot-Watt University’s Edinburgh campus in April 2008. This paper contains an analysis and discussion of the results of the survey and discusses the implications for green logistics. It shows that students shop for food online less than the general population and that their shopping online for food is statistically correlated with car ownership, where they live and nationality. Overall it appears that shopping online has made very little difference to the monthly car mileage of the respondents.

Executive Summary Recent dot-com failures have raised a cloud of suspicion over the viability of new ventures known as pure plays, which characteristically enter new markets exclusively via the Internet. Many of these firms have met with unfavorable reaction from the financial markets due to lack of profits and weak capital infrastructure. The strategic efficacy of the pure play model is critical in light of forecasts projecting total Internet electronic commerce ranging between $ 1 and $ 1. 3 trillion by 2003, while the business to consumer sales portion is expected to reach $ 18...|$|R
