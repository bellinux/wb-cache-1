40|$|The {{possibility}} of Britain {{withdrawing from the}} European Union – a “Brexit” – has been receiving growing attention.

25|$|Around {{the turn}} of the century, Boltzmann's science was being {{threatened}} by another philosophical objection. Some physicists, including Mach's student, Gustav Jaumann, interpreted Hertz to mean that all electromagnetic behavior is continuous, as if there were no atoms and molecules, and likewise as if all physical behavior were ultimately electromagnetic. This movement around 1900 deeply depressed Boltzmann since it <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> end of his kinetic theory and statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|The 1841 census {{showed a}} {{population}} of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage. They had to work for their landlords {{in return for the}} patch of land they needed to grow enough food for their own families. This was the system which forced Ireland and its peasantry into monoculture, since only the potato could be grown in sufficient quantity. The rights to a plot of land in Ireland <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> {{difference between life and death}} in the early 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Mia visits Peyton, and Peyton is {{concerned}} that Mia is not focused on her work. She suggests to Mia that she listen to a CD of songs she could possibly sing. They clash because Mia writes all of her own songs. Eventually, Peyton gives up on Mia and asks her to leave the label. Meanwhile, Peyton deals with stomach pains. She sees a doctor about it, and tells the doctor about Ellie's cancer. Her tearful face after the phone call predicts trouble ahead. Peyton later finds out {{that she does not}} have cancer, but is actually pregnant. She tells Lucas first, and Haley finds out in her own time, but Peyton seems hesitant to share her news with Brooke because she knows how much Brooke has wanted a family. Peyton eventually tells Brooke, and Brooke is happy for her. Peyton has her first ultrasound, but is upset because she thinks that Lucas is too busy to come and has forgotten. Lucas surprises her by coming, and the two get to hear their baby's heartbeat for the first time. Later, Lucas and Peyton learn that Peyton has placenta praevia and that having this baby <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> end of Peyton's life. Lucas, afraid of losing her and raising a child that has to go through the same motherless state Peyton did, tries to guilt her into an abortion. They get past this and decide to have the baby. Lucas tells her that he wants to get married to her sooner, not because she might die beforehand, but because he loves her, and wants her to be his wife. Lucas and Peyton get married at the lake where they met. Haley is the minister. After the reception, Lucas and Peyton go home and Peyton collapses on the floor while waiting for Lucas's surprise. Lucas walks in the house and finds Peyton unconscious on the floor in a pool of blood. Peyton is rushed to the hospital by a blood-covered Lucas, who begs her not to leave him. Peyton goes through an emergency caesarean section, and falls into a coma. The caesarean section is successful and she has a daughter named Sawyer Brooke Scott. She later awakes with Lucas and Brooke by her side. Karen brings in Sawyer, and Nathan, Haley, Jamie and Julian join them. Dan visits Peyton and she, after some hesitation, allows Dan to hold Sawyer. She and Lucas then leave Tree Hill.|$|E

Several riders suffered punctures, especially during the fast descents, and problems with their brakes and the riders took the decision to neutralise the stage and took shelter under a bridge. The race organisers, led by race director Eddy Merckx, tried to persuade the riders to carry on, {{and at one point}} it was suggested that the cancellation of the stage <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> end of the Tour of Oman altogether. It was eventually agreed, however, that the riders would take a short flat route to the stage finish.|$|E
500|$|Vandersteen was now at {{the height}} of his {{productivity}} as a solo artist. Apart from his work for De Standaard and Het Nieuwsblad, he contributed to Ons Volk and Ons Volkske, he made a special Suske en Wiske story for het Parochieblad (a weekly Christian newspaper), and he started to contribute to Kuifje journal (Tintin magazine) that published Hergé. The magazine was very popular in Wallonia, but struggled in Flanders, where The Adventures of Tintin was not yet as well known. A popular Flemish author would give the sales a boost, while it <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> breakthrough on the French language market for Vandersteen. However, Hergé, as editor-in-chief, set a very high quality standard for his magazine, and Vandersteen had to improve and stylize his drawings, and had to remove the more Flemish, popular aspects of his comics. Vandersteen obliged, and the stories of Suske en Wiske he created for Kuifje are now considered the best of his career, with the first one, Het Spaanse Spook (The Spanish Ghost), which started on 16 September 1948, as his masterpiece. It was because of his work for Kuifje that Hergé nicknamed Vandersteen [...] "The Brueghel of the Comic Strip".|$|E
500|$|In 1941 the {{situation}} improved. From 1 January to 5 March 1941, 79 ships were sunk. In return, just one U-boat was damaged. But in August to December, three were sunk and another three damaged by air attack. With just 12 U-boats at sea {{this was a}} considerable achievement. DCs were being circulated to squadrons and ASV was coming online, though some crews {{did not believe in}} its ability to detect submarines. Coastal Command issued tactical instructions to enact 'full release' of DCs, spaced 60 feet apart, and set at a depth of 50 feet. Later, pistols achieved 25–32 feet depth. The spacing was later altered to 100 feet. The 'total release' was questioned. A miss <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> exhausting of ammunition for other sightings. Aircraft like the Wellington could carry ten [...] DCs, one of which could sink a U-boat if it hit within [...] Total release of 10 DCs would be wasteful. The aircraft were ordered to attack within 30 seconds of a sighting, as U-boats could dive in that time. Some crews attacked below the 100 foot altitude stated and had to avoid striking the submarine. The modified naval [...] DC could not be released at over , as it broke up. The [...] DC could be dropped at speeds of [...] and was very accurate. It became the standard weapon.|$|E

2500|$|In Polish historiography, {{the term}} [...] "Fourth Partition of Poland" [...] {{has also been}} used, in {{reference}} to any subsequent annexation of Polish lands by foreign invaders.

2500|$|The Roman {{military}} was keen on {{the doctrine of}} power projection [...] it frequently removed foreign rulers by force or intimidation {{and replaced them with}} puppets. This was facilitated by the maintenance, for at least part of its history, of a series of client states and other subjugate and buffer entities beyond its official borders, although over which Rome extended massive political and military control. On the other hand, this also <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> payment of immense subsidies to foreign powers and opened the possibility of extortion in case military means were insufficient.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} by Tim Oliver {{studies the}} theoretical discussions of Brexit, Grexit and other exit scenarios. Oliver starts {{from the fact}} that the UK’s vote to leave the European Union has presented the integration project with an unprecedented challenge. What this <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> for <b>the</b> EU has been the subject of increased levels of analysis and speculation, albeit nowhere near as comprehensive as that into what <b>the</b> vote might <b>mean</b> for <b>the</b> UK. One concern is that Brexit signals or could begin the unravelling of the EU, eventually leading to its complete collapse and disintegration. To examine whether or not Brexit will lead to European disintegration, this chapter explores some of the analysis into what Brexit <b>could</b> <b>mean</b> for <b>the</b> EU and then explores some of the theoretical debates about European disintegration...|$|R
