40|$|Viscosity and {{adhesion}} {{properties of}} NBR/SMR L blend based pressure-sensitive adhesive were investigated using <b>coumarone-indene</b> resin, toluene, and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) as tackifier, solvent, and coating substrate, respectively. <b>Coumarone-indene</b> resin content was fixed at 40 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr) in the adhesive formulation. The ratio of NBR/SMR L blend used was 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 % of NBR content. Four different thicknesses, that is, 30, 60, 90, and 120 [*]µm, {{were used to}} coat the PET film. The viscosity of adhesive was determined by a Brookfield viscometer, whereas loop tack, peel strength, and shear strength were measured using a Lloyd Adhesion Tester operating at 30 [*]cm/min. Result indicates that the viscosity, loop tack, and shear strength of blend adhesives increase with % NBR. However, for peel strength, it indicates a maximum at 40 % NBR blend ratio for the three modes of peel tests. In all cases, 120 [*]µm coated sample consistently exhibits the highest adhesion values {{compared to the other}} coating thicknesses, an observation which is associated with the higher volume of adhesive in the former system...|$|E
40|$|The {{dependence}} of loop tack, peel strength, and shear strength of NBR/SMR L blend-based pressure-sensitive adhesives on {{the rate of}} testing was investigated using <b>coumarone-indene</b> resin and toluene as the tackifier and solvent, respectively. A 40 % NBR content in the NBR/SMR L blend was used throughout the experiment. The adhesion properties were measured by a Lloyd Adhesion Tester operating at different rates of testing. The result indicates that loop tack, peels strength, and shear strength increase with the rate of testing due to the viscoelastic response of the adhesive. At low testing rate, the failure mode is cohesive in nature whereas adhesion failure mode occurs at higher testing rates. Adhesion properties also increase {{with the increase in}} adhesive coating thickness, an observation which is attributed to the wettability of the adhesive and viscoelastic behavior of the rubber blend...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} sodium sulfate as filler on viscosity, tack, and {{adhesion}} properties of Standard Malaysian Rubber (SMR 10) -based pressure-sensitive adhesive were studied. <b>Coumarone-indene</b> resin and toluene {{were used as}} the tackifier and solvent respectively throughout the experiment. The results show that viscosity of adhesive increases with addition of sodium sulfate. For rolling ball tack test, the distance traveled by rolling ball decreases with increasing sodium sulfate concentration indicating the increase of tack value with sodium sulfate. The distance traveled by the rolling ball decreases with coating thickness of adhesive. For cross-hatch adhesion test, result shows that maximum adhesion occurs between 30 and 40 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr) of sodium sulfate content, an observation which is attributed to the maximum of wettability of adhesive. The 60 mm of adhesive coating thickness shows good performance of adhesion property of SMR 10 -based pressure-sensitive adhesive...|$|E
40|$|Viscosity, tack and, {{peel and}} shear {{strengths}} of ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) /standard Malaysian rubber (SMR L) blend adhesive were studied using various blend ratios {{of the two}} rubbers, ranging from 0 to 100 % EPDM. <b>Coumarone-indene</b> resin, toluene, and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) were used as the tackifier, solvent, and coating substrate, respectively. The tackifier content was fixed at 40 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr). A SHEEN hand coater was used to coat the adhesive on PET film at four coating thicknesses, that is, 30, 60, 90, and 120 [*]µm. The viscosity and adhesion properties were determined by a Brookfield viscometer and a Lloyd Adhesion Tester, respectively. Results show that the viscosity, loop tacks and peel strength of blend adhesives decrease gradually with increasing % EPDM. This observation is attributed to dilution effect and lowering in wettability and compatibility. Shear strength, however, passes through a maximum at 20 – 40 % EPDM blend ratio, an observation which is ascribed to culmination of cohesive strength at the optimum EPDM blend ratio. Increasing coating thickness increases the adhesion properties in all blend ratios in this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{adhesion}} property (i. e. viscosity, loop tack and peel strength) of {{epoxidized natural rubber}} (ENR 25 and ENR 50 grade) -based pressure-sensitive adhesive was studied {{in the presence of}} calcium carbonate. The range of calcium carbonate loaded was from 10 to 50 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr). <b>Coumarone-indene</b> resin was used as the tackifier and its concentration was fixed at 80 phr. Toluene was chosen as the solvent throughout the investigation. The substrates (PET film/paper) were coated with the adhesive using a SHEEN hand coater at a coating thickness of 60 µm. Viscosity of the adhesive was measured by a HAAKE Rotary Viscometer whereas loop tack and peel strength were determined by a Llyod Adhesion Tester operating at 30 cm/min. Results show that viscosity of ENR-based adhesives increases gradually with increase in calcium carbonate loading due to the concentration effect of the filler. However, for loop tack and peel strength, it passes through a maximum at 30 phr calcium carbonate, an observation which is attributed to the optimum wettability of adhesive on the substrate at this adhesive composition. ENR 25 -based adhesive consistently exhibits higher {{adhesion property}} than ENR 50 for all calcium carbonate loadings studied...|$|E
40|$|The loop tack, peel {{strength}}, and {{shear strength}} of crosslinked {{epoxidized natural rubber}} (ENR 25) /ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) blend adhesives were investigated. <b>Coumarone-indene</b> resin, toluene, and benzoyl peroxide were used as the tackifier, solvent, and crosslinking agent, respectively, throughout the experiment. The adhesive was coated on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate using a SHEEN hand coater at 60 [*]μm and 120 [*]μm coating thickness. It was cured at 80 °C for 30 minutes before testing on a Lloyd adhesion tester operating at testing rates from 10 to 60 [*]cm[*]min− 1. Results show that loop tack and peel strength of the ENR 25 /EPDM adhesive pass through a maximum value at 2 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr) of benzoyl peroxide content. This observation is attributed {{to the increase in}} crosslinking which enhances the cohesive strength of the adhesive. Further addition of the crosslinking agent decreases the tack and peel strength due to the decrease in wettability of the over-crosslinked adhesive. Shear strength, however, increases steadily with benzoyl peroxide content, an observation which is associated with the steady increase in the cohesive strength. The adhesion properties increase with increasing coating thickness and testing rate...|$|E
