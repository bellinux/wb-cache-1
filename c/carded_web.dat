40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{the effects}} of {{variables}} such as initial <b>carded</b> <b>web</b> mass, needle penetration depth, punch density, {{and the frequency of}} incident sound wave on transmission of sound through polypropylene needle-punched nonwovens were investigated. Fibrous carded webs using commercially available 17 dtex, 90 mm staple length polypropylene fibers were prepared with different mass per unit area using carding machine. Samples were needled at various punch-densities and needle penetration depths were produced. Design points of experiments were set up using Taguchi experimental design method. Sound transmission loss (STL) of needled samples was measured using an impedance tube equipped with four microphones. Minitab software was used to analyze the sound transmission ability of the samples. Results indicated that all of the considered controllable factor have significant effects on STL values determined for the needled nonwovens. Also, initial <b>carded</b> <b>web</b> mass was found to be the most influential factor affecting sound transmission through the samples. It was concluded that an increase in thickness of the samples as well as mass per unit area of nonwovens results in higher sound transmission loss by the samples...|$|E

This paper presents a formal model of the smart <b>card</b> <b>Web</b> server specification and the proof of its security properties. The for-malization enables a thoughtful analysis of the specification that has revealed several ambiguities and potentially dangerous behaviors.

Fibre Cement Felts are a valued component required in the manufacturing process of Fibre Cement Sheets, used in construction for today’s building industry.

The main purpose of this research was to investigate the influence fibres types and parameters selected for manufacturing FCF. In addition the effects of the needling sequence, and the influence of these parameters on the final physical and performance characteristics of FCF. This research recognised that the mechanical properties of the fibre, and the manufacturing methods used both have an effect on the physical parameters and performance attributes of a FCF.

The load-displacement curve of the tensile test revealed that the elastic modulus and maximum vertical load in the longitudinal were far greater than these in the transverse direction; and tensile strengths were far apart in the longitudinal and transverse direction as well. In comparison with the tensile tests, the effect of basalt fiber orientation on the bending modulus and strength were relatively insignificant. In addition, from the micro fibril angle, we also verify that the orientation angle of basalt fiber {{is an important factor}} of influence to the mechanical property.

However, police information and communication technology (ICT) systems have stringent security requirements that may delay the deployment of these new applications, since necessary security measures must be implemented first. This paper presents an integrated security architecture for LEAs that is able to provide common security services to novel and legacy ICT applications, while fulfilling the high security requirements of police forces. By reusing the security services provided by this architecture, new systems do not have to implement custom security mechanisms themselves, and can be easily integrated into existing police ICT infrastructures.

The results of variance analysis have also proved the conclusion, the difference between transverse and longitudinal is more significant than the difference among different fiber proportions.

Control of sound in areas of transport and building industries is of paramount importance. Textiles are widely used as sound insulators. Among the broad spectrum of textiles, nonwoven fabrics due to their technical merits and wide acceptance are extensively used as sound controlling media. In this work, various blends of polypropylene and naturally grown hollow Estabragh fibers were used to prepare sound absorptive nonwoven layers. The fiber blends were fed to a laboratory scale <b>carding</b> machine. <b>Carded</b> <b>webs</b> were lightly needled on a laboratory scale needling machine.

Results show that the proportion of Estabragh fibers in the blends strongly affects the noise absorption coefficient (NAC). Frequency is the second effective factor and is followed by nonwoven layer mass (areal density) and punch density, respectively. It was concluded that layers comprised of 100 % Estabragh fibers achieved the highest value of NAC. The results also pointed to existence of a direct correlation between noise absorption coefficient and the amount of punch density exerted during needling process.
