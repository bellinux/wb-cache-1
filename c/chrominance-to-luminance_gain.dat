This pulse is made up of a sine-squared luminance pulse and a chrominance packet with a sine-squared envelope as shown in the figure below. This waveform has many advantages. First it allows for the evaluation of both gain and delay differences with a single signal. It also eliminates the need to separately establish a low-frequency amplitude reference with a white bar. Since a low-frequency reference pulse is present along with the highfrequency information, the amplitude of the pulse itself can be normalized. The HAD of 12. 5 T was chosen in order to occupy the chrominance bandwidth of NTSC as fully as possible and to produce a pulse with sufficient sensitivity to delay distortion...|$|E
