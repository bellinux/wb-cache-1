In fact, previous research, such as the effects of psychological empowerment on feedback-seeking behavior and role expansion, has provided some evidence supporting this view (Axtell and Parker 2003; Parker et al. 1997).|$|R

Therefore the generation of θ(N/log(N)) identical partitions of network state as described in the above analysis may not exactly hold.

In fact, we observe that the <b>required</b> <b>token</b> transfers actually decrease with increasing speed, indicating that data aggregation using self-repelling random walks is actually helped by mobility.|$|R

40|$|Selected {{spontaneous}} {{errors of}} word choice {{made between the}} ages of about 2 and 5 by 2 children whose language development has been followed longitudinally were analyzed for clues to semantic development. The errors involved the children's occasional replacement of a <b>contextually</b> <b>required</b> word by a semantically similar word after weeks or months of using both words appropriately. Because the errors were not present from the beginning and because correct usage prevailed most of the time, the errors cannot be explained by existing accounts of semantic development, which ascribe children's word-choice errors to initial linguistic immaturity. A plausible alternative account likens the errors to adult "slips of the tongue" in which the speaker, in the process of constructing a sentence to express a given meaning, chooses incorrectly among competing semantically related words. Interpreted in this way, the errors indicate that the process of drawing words into structured semantic systems based on shared meaning components begins much earlier than experimental studies have suggested. They also provide evidence for certain differences between children and adults in the planning and monitoring of speech...|$|R

40|$|Prefetch Support with Object {{relation}} {{discovery in}} an OSD System Object based storage device (OSD) technology [2], built {{on top of}} SAN [6], provides solution to problems of security and scalability associated with the block level storage. An intelligent OSD device exports object interface and provides access to object data only if the requester possesses <b>required</b> security <b>token.</b> Security tokens are issued by the OSD manager. Although after getting a token from the manager, requester can store it for subsequent operations on the given object, there are still considerable overheads for getting the <b>required</b> security <b>token</b> from the OSD manager. The performance of an object access can be improved by efficient prefetching of the security tokens. In this paper, we propose a prefetching model based on relation discovery among objects. Prediction of objects required in future is done by identifying relations among objects. Relations are defined using client feedback and analysis of access history. We also discuss design and implementation of our OSD system integrated with the prefetch mechanism. Performance analysis and results show power of this model in terms of reducing network traffic and overheads of object command processing. ...|$|R
40|$|The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has {{proposed}} the Guaranteed Service (GS) in the Integrated Services model with firm delay and bandwidth guarantees. In this paper, we study {{the effects of}} a token bucket traffic shaper at the source on the transmission characteristics of Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) compressed video streams over the GS. We develop an analytical model of the traffic shaper, and also carry out numerical simulation of the transmission performance using MPEG trace data from several different video sequences. The analytical model and the numerical simulation results are in excellent agreement. Our study provides a technique to determine the token bucket parameters that have to be specified while setting up a GS flow. Our study reveals that the traffic shaping process gives an end application a wide range of flexibility in controlling the delay. By choosing appropriate token bucket traffic shaper parameters, delay can be reduced significantly without the need to reserve costly network resources for less delay-sensitive applications, while time-critical applications may specify the <b>required</b> <b>token</b> bucket parameters for minimum delay. # 2000 Elsevier Science B.

50|$|These cafeterias {{featured}} {{prepared foods}} behind small glass windows and coin-operated slots, beginning with buns, beans, fish cakes and coffee. These were popular, busy restaurants, {{where in the}} late 1950s, for under $1.00, one could enjoy a large, if somewhat plain meal, purchased with nickels usually obtained from the cashier. Each stack of glass-doored dispensers had a metal cylinder that could be rotated by the staff {{on the other side}} of the vending wall, hiding the contents while they refilled each dispenser in the stack with a plate of salad, pudding, meat or vegetables. Each dispenser had a slot for one or more nickels, and a knob to rotate the nickels out of view into the internal cash box and to allow the glass door to be raised up and locked in a horizontal position for easy removal of the plate or bowl of food. More expensive items <b>required</b> <b>tokens</b> valued up to 75¢ which were available from the cashier. Some of the rectangular dispensers were heated, some cooled. Eventually, they served lunch and dinner entrees, such as beef stew and Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes. The self-service restaurants operated in the city for nearly a century.|$|R

The action in ID demonstrates how to specify token consumption and production. The part in front of the ==>, which we call input patterns, again pertains to input ports, and it specifies how many tokens to consume from which ports and what to call those tokens {{in the rest of the}} action. There is one input pattern in this action, In: a. It says that one token is to be read (and consumed) from input port In, and that the token is to be called a in the rest of the action.

Eventually, the player will decide to convert some of his excess population into cities.
