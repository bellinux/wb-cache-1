25|$|Engineers can {{now have}} {{numerical}} control over automated devices. The {{result has been}} a rapidly expanding range of applications and human activities.

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1980, the rumours {{surrounding}} CATIA {{reached the}} very top of the company and Marcel Dassault, then aged 88, asked for a demonstration of the software capabilities. The company management understood the engineers' vision and started to discuss how to leverage their innovation. They quickly realised they could not afford to keep and develop this invention internally and decided to create a new company - led by Francis Bernard - to explore the Computer-aided Design and <b>Computer-aided</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> market (CAD/CAM).|$|E

Of fear of the company failing completely the side, projects were abandoned as was the Ndix project. 1988 became the first year since 1967 that Norsk Data {{did not make a}} profit.

25|$|Instructions for {{manufacturing}} a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, {{or through the}} use of a <b>computer-aided</b> <b>manufacturing</b> (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings, but this is becoming an increasing rarity, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing. Engineers primarily manually manufacture parts in the areas of applied spray coatings, finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.|$|E
500|$|Herman Zimmerman was the {{production}} designer, and had {{three months to}} design and construct 55 full sets for the filmeighteen more than used in the previous film in the series. Zimmerman {{said that it was}} [...] "probably the most scenery we've built for a Star Trek motion picture since the first one, when everything was brand new". The Ba'ku village was built in full scale on location at Lake Sherwood, California, with architectural designs combining Thai, Balinese and Polynesian styles. The village included a bakery, a farm with a full irrigation system, a city hall, and a city square which was referred to as the [...] "rotunda". The location shoot lasted for six weeks. The buildings included sections built with styrofoam, which were cut out using computer aided design and <b>computer-aided</b> <b>manufacturing</b> techniques. These were covered in hardcoat to make them look as though they were made from stone, but they were not made waterproof. The set suffered water damage following record-levels of rainfall during the spring of 1998. The foam warped as it dried out in the sun, causing delays in shooting while repairs were made.|$|E

Experiment and examples are presented {{to illustrate the}} workflow.

2500|$|Computer aided {{design is}} now an {{essential}} tool in most aspects of contemporary architecture, but the particular nature of deconstructivism makes {{the use of computers}} especially pertinent. Three-dimensional modelling and animation (virtual and physical) assists in the conception of very complicated spaces, while the ability to link computer models to manufacturing jigs (CAM - <b>Computer-aided</b> <b>manufacturing)</b> allows the mass production of subtly different modular elements to be achieved at affordable costs. In retrospect many early deconstructivist works appear to have been conceived {{with the aid of a}} computer, but were not; Zaha Hadid's sketches for instance. Also, Gehry is noted for producing many physical models as well as computer models as part of his design process.
