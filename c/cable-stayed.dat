5|$|The Greenville Bridge is a <b>cable-stayed</b> {{bridge over}} the Mississippi River, in the United States, {{carrying}} US 82 and US 278 between Refuge, Mississippi, and Shives, Arkansas. When it opened in 2010, it was the fourth-longest <b>cable-stayed</b> bridge in North America.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Bridge {{which was}} built in 1836 across the River Avon, was an {{important}} early example of a <b>cable-stayed</b> bridge.|$|E
5|$|Construction officially {{began in}} October 2013, {{with the new}} spans being built {{to the north of}} the {{existing}} bridge. The new bridge will connect to the existing highway approaches of I-87 and I-287 on both river banks. The northbound/westbound span opened on August 25, 2017. Southbound/eastbound traffic remained on the old bridge until October 6, 2017. At that point, southbound/eastbound traffic shifted to the westbound span of the new bridge and the old bridge closed. When completed in 2018, the new Tappan Zee Bridge will be one of the longest <b>cable-stayed</b> spans in the nation.|$|E

50|$|The Liuguanghe Xiqian Expressway Bridge is a 375 metres high <b>cable-stay</b> bridge {{crossing}} the Yachi River between Xiuwen, Guiyang, and Qianxi, Bijie in Guizhou, China.|$|R
5000|$|The bridge {{will use}} a steel <b>cable-stay</b> design, akin to a {{suspension}} bridge, with just two piers in the river bed to minimise {{the effect on the}} river.|$|R
5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{believed}} to be the first steel box girder bridge built in the United States, and is considered a prototype of the <b>cable-stayed</b> bridge of which a very similar design by the Germans was completed, the Stroemsund Bridge in Sweden. Similar bridges include a timber-stayed bridge designed in Germany in 1784, the wrought-iron stayed Albert Bridge in London designed in 1873, and the Chow Chow Bridge in Grays Harbor County. The bridge was listed on the Washington Heritage Register on January 25, 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{monitored}} by 132 sensors, including sensors on hatches to the pontoons, on {{doors to the}} steel box girder, for corrosion, strain gauges on the girder and on flexible elements, and weather information. On the <b>cable-stayed</b> section, the bridge is marked with navigation lights, {{as well as the}} center of the sailing area having a racon. The bridge is the second-longest bridge in Norway, behind the Drammen Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{project cost}} NOK 910 million, of which NOK 513 {{was for the}} pontoon bridge, NOK 81 million was for the <b>cable-stayed</b> bridge, NOK 25 million {{was used for the}} waterway, NOK 115 million was used on planning, and NOK 176 million was used on {{auxiliary}} roads and the tunnel. The bridge was financed with NOK 41 million in state grants, NOK 139 million from tolls paid in advance, and NOK 730 million in debt which would be repaid by the tolls. Interest during construction cost NOK 138 million. The construction involved 1,150,000 man-hours.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{began in}} October 2000 using a {{cantilever}} method and temporary <b>cable-stays.</b> Over 35,000 tonnes of steel {{were used in}} construction. The bridge's arch was joined on October 7, 2002.|$|R
50|$|On 4 October 2009, the Kurilpa Bridge opened {{across the}} Brisbane River in Queensland, Australia. A multiple-mast, <b>cable-stay</b> {{structure}} {{based on the}} principles of tensegrity, it is currently the world's largest such structure.|$|R
50|$|Between Geoje and Jeo islands, a 1.65 km bridge {{includes}} a three-pylon <b>cable-stay</b> bridge. This bridge has two mainspans of 230 m with side spans of 106 m. The pylons are 102 m tall {{and there is}} 36 m of clearance underneath the bridge.|$|R
5|$|The stadium {{was built}} by Laing Construction {{at a cost of}} £112 million and was {{designed}} and engineered by ArupSport, whose design incorporated a <b>cable-stayed</b> roof structure, suspended by twelve exterior masts and attached cables. The stadium design has received much praise and many accolades, including an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2004 for its innovative inclusive building design, and a special award in 2003 from the Institution of Structural Engineers for its unique structural design.|$|E

When completed in 2018, including the new eastbound span (to carry lanes currently on the westbound span), the new Tappan Zee Bridge will be one of the longest <b>cable-stayed</b> spans in the nation.|$|E
5|$|The Albert Bridge is a {{road bridge}} over the River Thames in West London, {{connecting}} Chelsea on the north bank to Battersea on the south bank. Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish–Lefeuvre system modified <b>cable-stayed</b> bridge, {{it proved to be}} structurally unsound, so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design elements of a suspension bridge. In 1973 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers, which transformed the central span into a simple beam bridge. As a result, today the bridge is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles. It is an English Heritage Grade II* listed building.|$|E
50|$|Dedicated on April 30, 2009, Cupertino {{opened the}} Mary Avenue Bicycle Footbridge, the first <b>cable-stay</b> bicycle {{pedestrian}} bridge over a California freeway. This bridge connects {{the north and}} the south sections of the Stevens Creek Trail. The cost of the bridge project was $14,800,000.|$|R

5000|$|Kurilpa Bridge is the world’s largest hybrid {{tensegrity}} bridge. [...] Only {{the horizontal}} spars conform to tensegrity principles. The Kurilpa Bridge is a multiple-mast, <b>cable-stay</b> structure based on principles of tensegrity producing a synergy between balanced tension and compression components {{to create a}} light structure which is incredibly strong.|$|R
5|$|The SkyTrain was {{conceived}} as a legacy project of Expo 86; its first line, the Expo Line, was finished in 1985, in time to showcase the fair's theme: Transportation and Communication. The line connected Vancouver with the cities of Burnaby and New Westminster, with the terminus stations at Waterfront and New Westminster station. In 1989, the line was extended one station east to Columbia station. The Skybridge, the only <b>cable-stayed</b> bridge built for transit use in the world, was completed in 1990, extending the Expo Line eastward {{to the city of}} Surrey with the addition of Scott Road station. The line was extended eastward again with the opening of Gateway, Surrey Central, and King George stations in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the current}} bridge, four other bridges have spanned the Indian River Inlet, opened in 1934, 1940, 1952, and 1965, the latter widened by an {{additional}} span added in 1976. All were known informally as the Indian River Inlet Bridge, and all but the first officially were named the Charles W. Cullen Bridge. The 1965 bridge, a steel girder bridge, was subject to scouring from the inlet, leading {{to the need to}} replace it. Initial plans for a tied-arch bridge over the inlet in 2004 were over budget, and 2006 plans for a 1,400-foot (427-meter) <b>cable-stayed</b> bridge were cancelled because of early construction and legal problems. Construction of the current, 2,600-foot (792-meter) bridge began in 2008 as part of a design-build project, with Skanska awarded the contract to build the bridge. The current Indian River Inlet Bridge opened partially in January 2012 and completely in May 2012 at a cost of $150 million.|$|E
5|$|The Dartford-Thurrock River Crossing, {{commonly}} known as the Dartford Crossing and until 1991 the Dartford Tunnel, is a major road crossing of the River Thames in England, carrying the A282 road between Dartford in Kent to the south with Thurrock in Essex to the north. It consists of two bored tunnels and the <b>cable-stayed</b> Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. The only fixed road crossing of the Thames east of Greater London, it is the busiest estuarial crossing in the United Kingdom, with an average daily use of over 130,000 vehicles. It opened in stages: the west tunnel in 1963, the east tunnel in 1980 and the bridge in 1991. The crossing, although not officially designated a motorway, is considered part of the M25 motorway's route, using the tunnels northbound and bridge southbound. Described {{as one of the most}} important road crossings in Britain, it suffers from heavy traffic and congestion.|$|E
50|$|Slightly {{upstream}} {{from the current}} bridge stands an earlier suspension bridge. Originally completed in 1925, it was destroyed in World War II and rebuilt in 1951 with the same concrete towers. Over time, these towers suffered from alkali-silica reaction ("Concrete cancer"), and were deemed no longer rational to maintain, necessitating the current, <b>cable-stay</b> design.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This conference {{paper will}} provide a {{detailed}} study on the Martin Olav Sabo Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The <b>cable-stay</b> design will be critically analysed in aesthetics and the structural form will be assessed considering {{a full range of}} loadings. The paper will also evaluate the construction of the bridge, its durability and the possibility of future changes...|$|R
50|$|By October 2014, {{work had}} {{started on the}} pilings which would serve as {{foundations}} for the new bridge's piers. The two <b>cable-stay</b> support towers were started in March (eastern tower) and April 2015 (western tower). Approach spans were underway by April 2016. By August 2016, the project had passed the halfway mark, and the two cable support towers were already more than 200 ft high.|$|R
5|$|The {{contract}} {{for construction of}} the pontoon bridge was awarded in August 1991 to a consortium, Arbeidsfellesskapet Salhus Bru, which consisted of Norwegian Contractors, Aker Entreprenør, Veidekke and Kværner Eureka. The components were built in Moss and Fredrikstad and then shipped to Lonevågen, a branch of Osterfjorden which was suitable to connect the parts. There were problems welding the high-strength low-alloy steel, {{which resulted in the}} work being halted for several days before an agreement was reached between the contractor and the Public Roads Administration. On 26 January 1994, the steel frame which would be used to fasten the pontoon bridge to the <b>cable-stayed</b> bridge, came adrift during transport in Skagerrak, and was severely damaged, causing a delay in the project. As the bridge had the longest laterally unsupported span in the world, the construction was watched by many international delegations.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Jure Radić, and built by Konstruktor, Split, between 1993 and 1996, using free cantilevering with temporary <b>cable-stays.</b> The reinforced-concrete arch was executed in 5 m long segments, matching spandrel column spacing. Prefabricated girders required for the structure were executed and prestressed in a purpose built plant on the site. The same plant was subsequently used to produce Jersey barriers used as bridge protective barriers.|$|R
50|$|The {{durability}} of prestressed concrete is principally {{determined by the}} level of corrosion protection provided to any high-strength steel elements within the prestressing tendons. Also critical is the protection afforded to the end-anchorage assemblies of unbonded tendons or <b>cable-stay</b> systems, as the anchorages of both of these are required to retain the prestressing forces permanently. Failure {{of any of these}} components can result in the release of prestressing forces, or the physical rupture of stressing tendons.|$|R
2500|$|The new {{bridge was}} {{completed}} in 22months, and cost US$25,000,000 to build. The bridge is anchored by four pairs of pylons, with each pylon weighing [...] The pylons rest on 10 smaller micropiles that extend [...] into bedrock. From the pylons, a total of 24 <b>cable-stays</b> support the approach spans, {{as well as the}} ends of the center span. A suspension cable, running from anchorages {{at the feet of the}} bridge to the tops of the pylons, supports the middle portion of the center span.|$|R
