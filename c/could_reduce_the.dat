5|$|The {{possibility}} of reopening the Bergen Street lower level was {{looked at as}} part of the study for the reintroduction of F express service as it <b>could</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> impact of less local service at the busy station. The station, if reopened, would require significant and expensive reconstruction, including making the station ADA accessible, the reconstruction of platform stairs, improved lighting and communications, waterproofing and concrete repairs, among other things. The rehabilitation would cost $75 million, and therefore the lower level is not currently planned to be reopened.|$|E
5|$|The self-damage {{induced by}} the {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium {{is so strong that}} it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples <b>could</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> melting point value.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the MAR, {{which would}} be {{tracking}} targets primarily from the north, the MSR would be tracking its interceptors in all directions. MSR was thus built into a four-faced truncated pyramid, with {{any or all of}} the faces carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, like the one considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays on all four faces. Those that were networked into denser systems <b>could</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> number of faces and get the same information by sending tracking data from site to site.|$|E

Results: Compared with the model group(MG), Motherwort total alkaloid high, medium dose group(HD, MD) <b>could</b> significantly <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> pathological changes of the prostate (P <  0. 01); Finasteride(FG) and Motherwort total alkaloid low dose group(LD) <b>could</b> significantly <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> pathological changes of the prostate (P <  0. 05); Longbishu capsules(LG), Finasteride, Motherwort total alkaloid medium dose group <b>could</b> significantly <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> pathological changes of the kidney (P <  0. 01); Motherwort total alkaloid low dose group <b>could</b> significantly <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> pathological changes of the kidney (P <  0. 05); Motherwort total alkaloids could improve the pathological changes of the thymus and spleen.

5|$|During {{the latter}} part of Diệm's rule, a {{centerpiece}} of the rural pacification campaign was the large-scale construction of strategic hamlets, whereby villagers were compelled to move into fortified camps in an attempt to lock out insurgents. However this failed as many were able to infiltrate the settlements, whereas a previous implementation of such principles in Malaya had been successful as the local communists were ethnic Chinese who were physically distinguishable from the anti-communist ethnic majority. It also angered the peasants, who were forced to abandon their ancestral lands and homes, and build new dwellings in the new villages. Many of these hamlets were subsequently overrun in communist attacks, something many villagers found to their liking. General Lê Văn Kim oversaw the future of the program for Minh and it was decided to liberalize the system to try to win over the peasants. They forecast that they <b>could</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> insurgency's support by 30% alone through these less restrictive arrangements, citing more cooperative attitudes in Mekong Delta regions heavily populated with Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài. However this upset and aroused suspicions among the Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic model}} can be {{extended}} to incorporate a supra-game played by {{the governments of the}} respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and anticipating the reaction of the firms (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium the governments choose a level of subsidy that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – an export tax., where m is a competitively produced numéraire good This is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an export tax <b>could</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the expanse of the third country which imports the good.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{signed for}} League Two team Notts County on a two-year {{contract}} on 22 July 2009, {{on the same}} day that Sven-Göran Eriksson arrived at the club as director of football. He scored a hat-trick on his debut in a 5–0 victory over Bradford City on the opening day of the season. He then got his second hat-trick against Northampton Town in a 5–2 home win on 12 September. He claimed his third hat-trick of the campaign on 28 December during a 4–1 win over Burton Albion at the Pirelli Stadium. However the club endured a turbulent time, with manager Ian McParland sacked and replaced by Hans Backe, who himself resigned after Qadbak Investments proved unable to fund Backe's wages. New owner Ray Trew appointed Steve Cotterill as manager, and County entered April ten points behind league leaders Rochdale, though Hughes remained confident that they <b>could</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> deficit and win the league. On 17 April, Hughes scored two goals in a 4–1 victory over Morecambe as County won promotion to League One. He was named as League Two's Player of the Month in April. On 1 May, Hughes added another two goals in County's final home game of the season, making him the first Notts player to score 30 league goals since Tommy Lawton in the 1949–50 season. He finished as the division's top-scorer in 2009–10 with 30 league goals in 39 games, and was named on the PFA Team of the Year alongside teammates Kasper Schmeichel and Ben Davies. County won the league by a ten-point margin. In July 2010, Hughes signed a one-year extension to his contract that would see him at Meadow Lane until the summer of 2012.|$|E
30|$|The {{adverse effect}} of MTX-CS NGs, free MTX, and CS was {{analyzed}} by using HUVEC culture. As {{shown by the}} MTT assay (Fig.  5 c), the MTX-CS NGs <b>could</b> significantly <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> side effect while free MTX <b>could</b> significantly <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> viability of HUVEC. The viability of HUVEC was increased from 63.6 % for free MTX to 73.5 % for MTX-CS NGs (9.9 % increase in cell viability) at the 10  μM drug concentration (Fig.  5 c). The cell viability of HUVEC at 400  μM was still 69.95 %. The result indicated that MTX-CS NGs <b>could</b> <b>reduce</b> side effect on the normal cell.|$|R
