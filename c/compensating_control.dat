The parental chloroplasts were partitioned equally in approximately 76 % of the divisions, while in the remaining 24 % the deviations from equality were very small. To maintain a reasonable range of chloroplast numbers {{in the face of}} unequal partitioning, there must be some form of <b>compensating</b> <b>control</b> of chloroplast replication.

40|$|Currently, {{the speed}} at which {{materials}} can be transferred between ships at sea is limited by sea conditions. Rough sea conditions cause the payload to swing making load transfer difficult and time-consuming. The objective of this research is to develop a real-time, command <b>compensating</b> <b>control</b> for reducing sea state induced payload swing for shipboard robotic cranes. The future use of this control strategy will be to facilitate faster "ship-to-ship" payload transfer in rough sea conditions. In this study, only the sea-induced rotational motion of the ship is considered, since it is assumed that a station-keeping control maintains a constant position of the ship. This rotational motion is modelled using pitch-yaw-roll Euler angles. The shipboard robotic crane is modelled as a spherical pendulum attached to a three-degree-of-freedom manipulator. The three degrees-of-freedom are azimuth (rotation about an axis normal to the ship's deck), elevation (rotation about an axis parallel with the ship's deck, also referred to as luffing), and lift-line length. An inverse kinematics based approach and a sliding mode control strategy are explored. Both approaches use the azimuth and the elevation capability of the crane manipulator to maintain a horizontal position of the suspended load to reduce sea-induced payload sway...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{adaptive}} control method of three-phase inverter for standalone distributed generation systems (DGSs). The proposed voltage controller includes two control terms: {{an adaptive}} compensating term and a stabilizing term. The adaptive <b>compensating</b> <b>control</b> term is constructed to avoid directly calculating the time derivatives of state variables. Meanwhile, the stabilizing control term {{is designed to}} asymptotically stabilize the error dynamics of the system. Also, a fourth-order optimal load current observer is proposed {{to reduce the number}} of current sensors and enhance the system reliability and cost effectiveness. Stability of the proposed voltage controller and the proposed load current observer is fully proven by using Lyapunov theory. The proposed control system can establish good voltage regulation such as fast dynamic response, small steady state error, and low total harmonic distortion (THD) under sudden load change, unbalanced load, and nonlinear load. Finally, the validity of the proposed control strategy is verified through simulations and experiments on a prototype DGS testbed with a TMS 320 F 28335 DSP. For a comparative study, the feedback linearization for multi-input and multi-output (FLMIMO) control scheme is implemented and its results are presented in this pape...|$|E

40|$|Market {{models for}} {{software}} vulnerabilities have been disparaged {{in the past}} citing how these do little to {{lower the risk of}} insecure software. In this paper we argue that the market models proposed are flawed and not the concept of a market itself. A well-defined software risk derivative market would improve the information exchange for both the software user and vendor removing the often touted imperfect information state that is said to believe the software industry. In this way, users could have a rational means of accurately judging software risks and costs and as such the vendor could optimally apply their time between delivering features and averting risk in a manner demanded by the end user. It is of little value to increase the cost per unit of software by more than an equal <b>compensating</b> <b>control</b> in an attempt to create secure software. This paper argues that if the cost of an alternative control that can be added to a system is lower than the cost improving the security of the software itself, then it is uneconomical to spend more time and hence money improving the security of the software. It is argued that a software derivative market will provide the mechanism needed to determine these costs...|$|E

40|$|To enable {{compliant}} training modes with {{a rehabilitation}} robot, an important prerequisite {{is that any}} undesired human-robot interaction forces caused by robot dynamics must be avoided, either by an appropriate mechanical design or by <b>compensating</b> <b>control</b> strategies. Our recently proposed control scheme of "Generalized Elasticities" employs potential fields to compensate for robot dynamics, including inertia, beyond {{what can be done}} using closed-loop force control. In this paper, we give a simple mechanical equivalent using the example of the gait rehabilitation robot Lokomat. The robot consists of an exoskeleton that is attached to a frame around the patient's pelvis. This frame is suspended by a springloaded parallelogram structure. The mechanism allows vertical displacement while providing almost constant robot gravity compensation. However, inertia of the device when the patient's pelvis moves up and down remains a source of large interaction forces, which are reflected in increased ground reaction forces. Here, we investigate an alternative suspension: To hide not only gravity, but also robot inertia during vertical pelvis motion, we suspend the robot frame by a stiff linear spring that allows the robot to oscillate vertically at an eigenfrequency close to the natural gait frequency. This mechanism reduces human-robot interaction forces, which is demonstrated in pilot experimental results...|$|E
