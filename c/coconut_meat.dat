2500|$|The {{production}} of copra – removing the shell, breaking it up, drying – is usually done where the coconut palms grow. Copra {{can be made}} by smoke drying, sun drying, or kiln drying. Hybrid solar drying system [...] is also used to make drying process runs continuously, therefore it will reduce drying time. In hybrid solar drying system, solar energy is utilized during daylight and energy from burning biomass is used when sunlight is not sufficient or during night. Sun drying requires little more than racks and sufficient sunlight. [...] Halved nuts are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove mold-creating contaminants. [...] After two days the meat can be removed from the shell with ease, and the drying process is complete after three to five more days (up to seven in total). [...] Sun drying is often combined with kiln drying, eight hours of exposure to sunlight means the time spent in a kiln can be reduced by a day and the hot air the shells are exposed to in the kiln is more easily able to remove the remaining moisture. [...] This process can also be reversed, partially drying the copra in the kiln and finishing the process with sunlight. [...] There are advantages and disadvantages in both – starting with sun drying requires careful inspection to avoid contamination with mold while starting with kiln-drying can harden the meat and prevent it from drying out completely in the sun. [...] In India, small but whole coconuts can be dried over the course of eight months to a year, and the meat inside removed and sold as a whole ball. [...] Meat prepared in this fashion is sweet, soft, oily and is cream-coloured instead of being white. [...] <b>Coconut</b> <b>meat</b> can be dried using direct heat and smoke from a fire, using simple racks to suspend the coconut over the fire. [...] The smoke residue can help preserve the half-dried meat but the process overall suffers from unpredictable results and the risk of fires.|$|E

50|$|Virgin {{coconut oil}} (VCO) can be {{produced}} from fresh <b>coconut</b> milk, <b>meat,</b> or residue.

VCO can also be extracted from fresh meat by grating and drying it to a moisture content of 10-12%, then using a manual press to extract the oil. Producing it from coconut milk involves grating the coconut and mixing it with water, then squeezing out the oil. The milk can also be fermented for 36-48 hours, the oil removed, and the cream heated to remove any remaining oil.

40|$|AbstractRendang is a {{traditional}} Minangkabau food which voted by CNN viewers in 2011 {{as one of the}} most delicious foods in the world. The basic ingredients of rendang are beef <b>meat,</b> <b>coconut</b> milk and spices. The process of cooking rendang took around 6 to 7 hours at the temperature around 80 - 95 oC. There are 3 types of food will be produce during the cooking processes differentiated by water content and colors. They are as following: gulai (cooked until the sauce became thin and yellowish), kalio (cooked until the sauce was thick brown color) and rendang (cooked until the sauce was thick and dry and dark brown color). As the food is cooked in a relatively longer period of time and with various ingredients it is interesting to know the nutritional value of the food. This paper is presenting a preliminary results of the research which aim to evaluate the nutritional value of rendang by analyzing the chemistry compositions, protein digestibility (in-vitro), the profile of amino acid (HPLC), and measuring molecule weight of protein (SDS-PAGE). The result shown that the protein in rendang is decreased compare to fresh meat and kalio. The protein digestibility decreased in rendang compare to fresh meat and kalio and the amino acid content is decreased in rendang compare to fresh meat and kalio. The protein band is increased from fresh meat to kalio and rendang, where in fresh meat have 15 protein bands, 16 in kalio and 17 in rendang...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Diet and {{nutrition}} {{are known to}} play {{a pivotal role in}} the onset and progression of aging-related diseases, but it remains unclear how diet {{and nutrition}} influence aging processes in general. Telomeres, the nucleotide sequences that protect linear chromosome ends from degradation, are considered a biomarker of aging. Evidence that oxidative stress and inflammation can accelerate telomere attrition suggests that nutritional factors may impact telomere length (TL) and, hence, aging by either contributing to or protecting against oxidative and inflammatory processes. However, previous studies have produced inconsistent results on the relationship between TL and diet or nutritional status. Most studies have been cross-sectional and have been conducted among older adult Western populations. This study aimed to explore the association between longitudinally-assessed diet and adiposity measures and TL among a young Filipino population. Specifically, it tested the hypotheses that 1) processed meats, fried or grilled <b>meats,</b> <b>coconut</b> oil, and non-diet soda are each inversely associated with TL; 2) fish and fruit and vegetable consumption are positively associated with TL; 3) body mass index is associated with TL in a curvilinear fashion; and 4) height-adjusted waist circumference is inversely associated with TL. Contrary to all hypotheses, the data provided no evidence of an association between TL and any of the dietary factors of interest or either of the measures of adiposity. These results contrast with some previous studies but align with others. The lack of associations may have been due to the young age of the population, low caloric intake, low consumption of some of the food groups of interest, low levels of adiposity, population differences in anti-inflammatory regulatory networks, and/or methodological and statistical power limitations. Further research with non-Western populations of different ages is warranted in order to elucidate the reasons for inconsistent evidence across studies and populations. Future studies should ideally include multiple longitudinal measurements of diet, body composition, TL, and other markers of biological aging...|$|R
