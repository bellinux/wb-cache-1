5000|$|Paper {{honeycomb}} is {{also used}} as a packaging material. Glued with paper on both sides, it makes an excellent protecting material {{for all types of}} items. It is currently used in the following industries: paper, automotive, glass, ceramic, transportation, appliance, and furniture. Paper honeycomb can be die <b>cut,</b> <b>slit</b> scored or cookie cut into numerous sizes and shapes to protect products [...] "inside the box" [...] or [...] "outside the box". Paper honeycomb is a protective packaging alternative to wood, corrugated or EPS. Paper honeycomb is now being used in transportation applications such as rail car and truck dunnage.|$|E

50|$|Some {{members of}} this family have long necks and may be called giraffe weevils, {{particularly}} Trachelophorus giraffa. A few species are minor agricultural pests. The larvae of Rhynchitinae feed in flower buds, fruits, and terminal shoots, or are leaf miners. The subfamily Attelabinae are the true leaf rollers. The female <b>cuts</b> <b>slits</b> into leaves to deposit her eggs, and rolls {{that part of the}} leaf in which the larvae will feed.|$|R
5|$|In {{some species}} of cicada, the males remain in one {{location}} and call to attract females. Sometimes several males aggregate and call in chorus. In other species, the males move {{from place to}} place, usually with quieter calls while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds. After mating, the female <b>cuts</b> <b>slits</b> into the bark of a twig where she deposits her eggs.|$|R
50|$|The female <b>cuts</b> <b>slits</b> into leaves, lays her {{yellowish}} eggs on {{them and}} rolls up these leaves into cigar-shaped cylinders or ‘cradles’ for the developing larvae, that will feed and pupate in these the leaf wraps. The time of oviposition may take several weeks. Several cylinders per day are produced. The adult beetles will emerge in the summer. There are two generations per year. The larvae of the second generation overwinter in said cylinders.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, {{the local}} Home Guard <b>cut</b> <b>slits</b> through the {{corrugated}} iron shelter so that, {{in the event}} of invasion, it might serve as a sort of pillbox. On the basis of an estimated saving of £34,372, passenger services were withdrawn between Oxford and Princes Risborough from January 1963. The track between Thame and Morris Cowley was lifted in 1969, the allegedly deteriorating condition of Horspath Tunnel playing a large part in the decision.|$|R

50|$|Both {{males and}} females can mate {{multiple}} times, although most females seem to mate just once. After mating, the female <b>cuts</b> V-shaped <b>slits</b> in the bark of young twigs and lays about 20 eggs in each, {{for a total of}} 600 or more eggs. After about six to 10 weeks, the eggs hatch and the newborn nymphs drop to the ground, where they burrow and begin another 13- or 17-year cycle.|$|R

40|$|Microstrip antennas are now {{extensively}} used in {{many applications}} such as mobile and satellite communications due to their compactness, lightweight, low profile and conformability to any structure. The size of the conventional microstrip antennas such as rectangular, circular, and triangular, patches is large and unsuitable to be {{used in many}} applications, especially at the lower microwave range. Various techniques have been investigated in the literature {{to reduce the size of}} conventional structures. One can <b>cut</b> <b>slits</b> or slots on the basic shapes which will result in new compact geometries like slotted L-shaped and ring microstrip antennas. The main disadvantage of the resulting compact structures is the associated bandwidth reduction. However, bandwidth can be increased by adding lossy elements in turn of lower antenna efficiencies. One possible solution to avoid the use of lossy elements is the use of tunable or reconfigurable antenna concept [1]. In this case the small size antenna would not cover all bands simultaneously. Instead, it will provide narrower instantaneous bandwidths in a wide tuning range with better antenna efficiencies. © 2010 IEEE. IEE...|$|R

She gave a little tremble when I began, and then sat as still as a mouse.|$|R
50|$|Alternative {{theories}} {{for this}} symbol include {{it being a}} reference to a traditional treatment of a parasitic nematode called Dracunculus medinensis or Guinea worm. The worm was considered quite painful, as it causes blisters on whatever limb it takes up residence in. To remove the parasite, doctors would <b>cut</b> a <b>slit</b> in the skin right in its path and, when it poked its head from the wound, take a small stick and slowly wrap the worm around it until it was fully removed.|$|R
50|$|Males fly or hop from {{plant to}} plant looking for female aggregations. Females only mate once, while males mate {{multiples}} times. Soon after a female mates, she would start ovipositing eggs into {{the stem of}} the plant. Females have saw-like ovipositors {{that allow them to}} <b>cut</b> a <b>slit</b> into the plant stem and deposit her eggs. When the slits are filled up, she covers them with white secretions called egg froths. The egg froth protects the eggs from the elements, biotic and abiotic.|$|R

50|$|The adult female sawfly <b>cuts</b> <b>slits</b> in {{pine needles}} with her {{ovipositor}} and deposits one egg in each slit. These appear pale {{and give the}} needle a banded appearance. The eggs hatch after about four weeks. The young larvae feed {{on the sides of}} the pine needle, leaving an uneaten central section which withers and dies, remaining on the tree giving a distinctive straw-like effect. Older larvae eat the whole needle before moving on to the next. The larvae are gregarious, and can strip whole branches and trees of needles. If the tree is completely defoliated, the larvae move as a group onto a neighboring tree, or may start chewing at the soft bark of twigs. When their development is finished, they drop to the ground and spin cocoons in the needle litter or underground. Here they overwinter as prepupae, pupating in the spring and biting their way out of one end of the cocoon to emerge as adults. Some individuals may not emerge as adults until the following year, or have an extended diapause. In the northern part of the range there is a single generation each year, but further south there may be two or three, sometimes overlapping, generations.|$|R

50|$|In the U.S., {{the use of}} {{postage stamps}} caught on quickly and became more {{widespread}} when on March 3, 1851, {{the last day of}} its legislative session, Congress passed the Act of March 3, 1851 (An Act to reduce and modify the Rates of Postage in the United States). Similarly introduced {{on the last day of}} the Congressional session four years later, the Act of March 3, 1855 required the prepayment of postage on all mailings. Thereafter, postage stamp use in the U.S. quickly doubled, and by 1861 had quadrupled. In 1856, under the direction of Postmaster General James Campbell, Toppan and Carpenter, (commissioned by the U.S. government to print U.S. postage stamps through the 1850s) purchased a rotary machine designed to separate stamps, patented in England in 1854 by William and Henry Bemrose, who were printers in Derby, England. The original machine <b>cut</b> <b>slits</b> into the paper rather than punching holes, but the machine was soon modified. The first stamp issue to be officially perforated, the 3-cent George Washington, was issued by the U.S. Post Office on February 24, 1857. Between 1857 and 1861 all stamps originally issued between 1851 and 1856 were reissued with perforations. Initial capacity was insufficient to perforate all stamps printed, thus perforated issues used between February and July 1857 are scarce and quite valuable.|$|R
