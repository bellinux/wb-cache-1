25|$|The aircraft's {{extremely}} low wing loading of just 23.9lb/ft² gave it outstanding turning performance, and its high power-to-weight ratio of 0.186hp/lb gave superb <b>climbing</b> <b>performance</b> for the time. The {{lack of an}} engine supercharger was a serious handicap at high altitudes. Compared to the later Allison-engined P-40, the P-36 shared the P-40's traits of excellent high-speed handling, roll rate that improved at high speed, and relatively light controls at high speed. However, it was underpowered, affecting its acceleration and top speed, {{and it did not}} accelerate in a dive as well as the P-40.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Merlin III {{engine of}} Spitfire Is had a power rating of 1,030hp (768kW), {{supplies}} of 100 octane fuel from the United States started reaching Britain in early 1940. This meant that an [...] "emergency boost" [...] of +12 {{pounds per square}} inch was available for five minutes, with pilots able to call on 1,310hp (977kW) at 3,000 rpm at 9,000 feet (2,743 m). This boosted the maximum speed by [...] at sea level and [...] at [...] and improved the <b>climbing</b> <b>performance</b> between sea level and full throttle height. The extra boost wasn't damaging as long as the limitations [...] set forth in the pilot's notes were followed. As a precaution if the pilot had resorted to emergency boost, he had to report this on landing and it had to be noted in the engine log book. There was a wire 'gate' fitted, which the pilot had to break to set the engine to emergency power, this acted as an indicator that emergency power had been used and would be replaced by mechanics on the ground. The extra boost was also available for the Merlin XII fitted to the Spitfire II.|$|E
5000|$|Some VG kits {{available}} for light twin-engine airplanes may allow {{an increase in}} maximum takeoff weight. [...] The maximum takeoff weight of a twin-engine airplane is determined by structural requirements and single-engine <b>climb</b> <b>performance</b> requirements (which are lower for a lower stall speed). For many light twin-engine airplanes, the single-engine <b>climb</b> <b>performance</b> requirements determine a lower maximum weight rather than the structural requirements. Consequently, {{anything that can be}} done to improve the single-engine-inoperative <b>climb</b> <b>performance</b> will bring about an increase in maximum takeoff weight.|$|R

2500|$|The 1976 Commander line {{introduced}} two new models, the Commander 112TC with a {{turbocharged engine}} of 210hp and MTOW of 2,850lb, and the Commander 114 with a six-cylinder Lycoming IO-540 engine of 260hp. The 112TC {{had a significantly}} improved cruise speed of [...] when flying at higher altitudes, as high as , which was aided by a [...] increase in wingspan. However, the low <b>climb</b> <b>performance</b> made this useful only on long trips where the climb time was not a serious issue. In comparison, the 114 offered a far better powerplant for the airframe, providing roughly the same cruise speed as the 112TC but at lower altitudes, and the extra power giving it far better <b>climb</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Nimbus 2C and the Mini Nimbus C {{were the}} first two carbon-fibre {{aircraft}} to be built by Schempp-Hirth. The use of carbon-fibre significantly lightened the Mini Nimbus improving its <b>climbing</b> <b>performance</b> and increasing water ballast capacity while making assembly and disassembly much easier.|$|E
5000|$|The Isuzu buses aged quickly {{owing to}} rough roads on Lantau, and their <b>climbing</b> <b>performance</b> is {{relatively}} {{inferior to the}} newer MAN buses. MAN [...] "coaches" [...] gradually replaced {{the role of the}} Isuzu buses around 2009, becoming the majority of the operator's fleet currently.|$|E
50|$|The Mini-Nimbus {{glide ratio}} was {{somewhat}} less competitive than its primary rival in sailplane race competitions, the Alexander Schleicher ASW 20. However its superior <b>climbing</b> <b>performance</b> (altitude gained over time while climbing in lifting air) over its rivals {{made it the}} choice of some successful international soaring competition pilots in the late 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was fitted}} with a Piaggio P.VII engine, and showed itself to be very agile, with excellent <b>climb</b> <b>performance,</b> and no noticeable vices. The second prototype, MM.281, was tested 31 January 1935, and taken on strength with the Regia Aeronautica.|$|R
5000|$|Installation of vortex {{generators}} {{can usually}} {{bring about a}} slight reduction in stalling speed of an airplane and therefore reduce the required one-engine-inoperative <b>climb</b> <b>performance.</b> The reduced requirement for <b>climb</b> <b>performance</b> allows an increase in maximum takeoff weight, at least up to the maximum weight allowed by structural requirements. [...] An increase in maximum weight allowed by structural requirements can usually be achieved by specifying a maximum zero fuel weight or, if a maximum zero fuel weight is already specified {{as one of the}} airplane's limitations, by specifying a new higher maximum zero fuel weight. [...] For these reasons, vortex generator kits for many light twin-engine airplanes are accompanied by a reduction in maximum zero fuel weight and an increase in maximum takeoff weight.|$|R
2500|$|Fitting the new {{powerplant}} {{into the}} Ptraveler drastically improved the aircraft's take-off and <b>climb</b> <b>performance.</b> The new model {{was named the}} [...] "Ascender" [...] for its improved climb rate and also in tribute to the XP-55 Ascender, an early canard fighter design. In 1981 a complete kit cost USD$4200.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} the two-seaters was {{designated}} 519A to reflect its modifications. The second two-seater, however, was so different that it received a completely new number from Avro - 522 - and featured new wings with both upper and lower wings of equal but greater span, {{in the hope that}} this would rectify the type's poor <b>climbing</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like the French tank, the Holt Gas-Electric had a 75 mm gun placed {{low in the}} V-shaped nose; two {{removable}} Browning 7.62 mm {{machine guns}} in sponsons on each side. The engine and transmission were in the rear, next to a corridor leading to the only door. Only one was built as tests showed its <b>climbing</b> <b>performance</b> was unsatisfactory and it was much heavier than planned, about 25 ST.|$|E

The three phase, brushless AC {{induction motor}} offers {{four times the}} available power of typical DC motors, and has a 100,000+ mile estimated lifetime (yet to be warranted by the company). The AC motors are paired to Curtis-Albright AC Motor Controllers and optimized for hill <b>climbing</b> <b>performance</b> [...] - [...] a problem for many electric vehicles.|$|E
50|$|After {{the first}} flight, on 30 January 1968, Helmut Reichmann (world {{standard}} and 15m class champion) flew the FS-25 in the German national gliding championship, where he demonstrated the harmony of the controls, agility and the excellent <b>climb</b> <b>performance</b> {{due to the}} high aspect ratio and low wing loading.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} the Phoenix was designed, {{emphasis}} was placed on <b>climb</b> <b>performance</b> rather than high cruising speed, with a low wing loading to optimise thermalling and a faster cruise speed (best Lift /Drag speed) achieved through careful attention to fuselage shape, wing incidence, aspect ratio and other criteria.|$|R

50|$|Around December 1975 {{there was}} another major change in the CitiCar {{assembly}} line. All CitiCars #2781 and higher were equipped with a 5.17:1 ratio Dana/Spicer rear axle and a 6 hp GE motor. There was an optional hilly Dana/Spicer axle with a higher ratio also available for these cars which allowed better hill <b>climbing</b> <b>performance,</b> but {{at the cost of}} a slightly lower top speed. These vehicles are also known as Transitional Citicars.|$|E
50|$|Schade would {{eventually}} {{take one of}} the test aircraft on a flight from Berlin to Dessau later in the summer of 1916, achieving a speed of 180 km/h with the aircraft, which was some 16 km/h faster than the contemporary French Nieuport 11, but as the J 2 test aircraft still seemed to come up short in <b>climbing</b> <b>performance</b> tests when evaluated against wood structure designs like the then new Albatros D.I, the steel structure of the J 2 made it just too heavy to be able to compete in air combat over the Front.|$|E

40|$|Diverging All Engine Standard Instrument Departures (SIDs) and Engine Out Standard Instrument Departures (EOSIDS) {{paths in}} Commercial Large Aircraft Operations {{have always been}} an {{intractable}} problem which has resulted in over simplified escape paths that do not fully cover the full intent of aircraft regulations. SIDs are designed and implemented for the normal flyaway case, as such they do not take into consideration a degraded <b>climb</b> <b>performance</b> that occurs with a failed engine. On the contrary, EOSIDs are solely defined for safety of flight and therefore consider degraded <b>climb</b> <b>performance.</b> Our new modeling capability on SIDs and EOSIDS has revealed unforeseen paths that appear to challenge {{the notion that the}} worst possible engine failure case always occurs on the runway. Furthermore, it has highlighted lack of guidance in regulations that leave operators on their own to provide practical guidance to their Flight Crews...|$|R
50|$|Aircraft with {{centre line}} thrust {{propeller}} configurations (e.g. the Cessna 337) {{may still have}} a critical engine, if failure of one engine (either the front or rear) has more of {{a negative effect on}} aircraft control or <b>climb</b> <b>performance</b> than failure of the other engine although the yawing and rolling moments will be small.|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests show}} that the {{aerodynamic}} performance of a rectangular 3 -D wing is increased by changing its tip to an ogee shape.

5000|$|These {{machines}} served widely with seaplane stations {{throughout the}} North Sea and Baltic Sea. The SF-5 was generally disliked by its aircrews, who dubbed it the [...] "Lame Crow" [...] {{on account of}} its poor banking and <b>climbing</b> <b>performance</b> and general sluggishness. Crews found that the supposed cruising speed of production examples was in fact their top speed. Some SF-5s perhaps saw action as bombers against Russian forces, but even those flying reconnaissance missions were easy prey for Russian fighters. At least two SF-5s were captured by the Russians and put to use by them.|$|E
50|$|Countering {{these studies}} are other works that have {{identified}} the Ape Index as a significant (or potentially significant) factor. A 2001 study comparing teenage male and female rock climbers noted that performance differences between the genders {{could be explained by}} a number of factors, one of which was the lower Ape Index found in the female climbers. Similarly, in a later work {{it was found that the}} Ape Index was statistically significant, and thus determined that it was one of a number of variables that provided the highest diagnostic value in the prediction of <b>climbing</b> <b>performance.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Lancair Propjet is a four-seat, pressurized, {{composite}} aircraft {{powered by a}} 750-hp Walter M601E turboprop engine. The aircraft is based on Lancair's successful kit-plane, the Lancair IV.

50|$|Aircraft {{such as the}} Airbus A340 and the Boeing 747-400 use winglets. Other designs such as some {{versions}} of the Boeing 777 and the Boeing 747-8 omit them in favor of raked wingtips. Large winglets such as those seen on Boeing 737 aircraft equipped with blended winglets are most useful during short-distance flights, where increased <b>climb</b> <b>performance</b> offsets increased drag.|$|R
50|$|The Ki-27 {{made its}} first flight on 15 October 1936. Although it had a slower top speed and worse <b>climb</b> <b>performance</b> than its competitors, the Army chose the Nakajima design for its {{outstanding}} turning ability granted by its remarkably low wing loading. The Army ordered 10 pre-production samples (Ki-27a) for further testing, which featured an enclosed cockpit with sliding canopy and larger wings.|$|R
