5|$|Frigatebirds {{typically}} breed on remote oceanic islands, {{generally in}} colonies {{of up to}} 5000 birds.

40|$|Ionospheric {{disturbances}} at the crests of {{the equatorial}} anomaly during some geomagnetic storms were investigated.

40|$|It {{has been}} found that a strong {{correlation}} exists between sudden stratospheric warmings and sudden <b>commencements</b> <b>of</b> geomagnetic activity.
