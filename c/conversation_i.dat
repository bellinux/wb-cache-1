To be an older {{director}} was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E

He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, [...] "it's only me." [...] They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.|$|E

Kesha said that the song originated from a discussion {{they had in the}} studio on the politics of female-male relationships which Kesha later explained, [...] "The song came about when the people that wrote it — me, Benny Blanco, Neon Hitch and [...] Sean Foreman — all got in a room, and they were talking about how chicks talk too much," [...] "And me and Neon were like, 'No, no, no, guys talk too much," [...] "So, we had this war of who were more obnoxious, chicks or dudes. And the song kind of came around from that <b>conversation.</b> <b>I</b> think I make a pretty fair point both in this video and in the song, that dudes are way more annoying." ...|$|E

500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone <b>conversation</b> <b>I</b> ever had with him was really great, and we didn't {{have any kind of}} blow-up." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} {{deviation of}} the film's plot from history {{is that there}} is scant evidence in real life Austen and Lefroy's relationship went beyond acquaintance. Rather, all that is known of them together is that they danced at three Christmas balls before Tom returned to school and that Jane was [...] "too proud" [...] to ask his aunt about him two years later. In the latter years of Tom Lefroy's life, he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew, and admitted to having loved Jane Austen, but stated that it was a [...] "boyish love". As is written in a letter sent from T.E.P. Lefroy to James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870,My late venerable uncle ... said in so many words that {{he was in love with}} her, although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love. As this occurred in a friendly & private <b>conversation,</b> <b>I</b> feel some doubt whether I ought to make it public.Lori Smith, author of The Jane Austen Guide to Life, opined that:No doubt this relationship and her [...] repartee with Tom fueled her writing. Whether it was [...] "her greatest inspiration" [...] as the trailers for Becoming Jane claim, well, that's debatable. But I'm sure it provided as spark.However, contrary to the film's story line, Jane had attempted her first full-length novel before she met Tom and had already read The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling before meeting him. In a cut scene from the movie, it is clear that she is reading the novel for the second time, but in the theatrical release without that scene, it appears he introduces her to it.|$|E
500|$|In August 2016, Kerry King {{was asked}} if Slayer will release a {{follow-up}} to Repentless. He replied, [...] "We've got lots of leftover material from the last album, 'cause we wrote so much stuff, and we recorded a bunch of it too. If the lyrics don't change the song musically, those songs are done. So we are {{way ahead of the}} ballgame without even doing anything for the next record. And I've been working on stuff on my downtime. Like, I'll warm up and a riff will come to mind and I'll record it. I've gotten a handful of those on this run. So wheels are still turning. I haven't worked on anything lyrically yet except for what was done on the last record, so that's something I've gotta get on. But, yeah, Repentless isn't quite a year old yet." [...] King also stated that Slayer is not expected to enter the studio until at least 2018. In an October interview on Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta's podcast, King stated that he is [...] "completely open" [...] to having guitarist Gary Holt (who had no songwriting contributions on Repentless) involved in the songwriting process of the next Slayer album. He explained, [...] "I'm entirely open to having Gary work on something. I know he's gotta work on an Exodus record and I've got tons already for this one. But, you know, if he's gonna stick around... I didn't want it on the last one, and I knew that. I'm completely open to having that <b>conversation.</b> <b>I</b> haven't talked to Tom about it, I haven't talked to Gary open about it, but I'm open. That's not saying it is or isn't gonna happen. But my ears are open." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a 2 * 2 matrix as a way of {{pointing}} at two new directions for supporting persistent conversations in mobile settings. These two directions include: 1) mobile support for asynchronous and long-term conversations, as well as 2) mobile support for synchronous and short-term conversations. The research presented in this paper builds upon both empirical studies conducted of mobile work forces, as well as theoretical work on CMC (Computer-Mediated Communication) for mobile settings. In this paper we also outline 7 requirements derived from our previous empirical and theoretical work. We then exemplify the two new directions proposed with two novel systems that support asynchronous and long-term <b>conversations</b> (<b>i.</b> e. the RoamWare system) and synchronous and short-term <b>conversations</b> (<b>i.</b> e. the SeamlessTalk prototype). Having exemplified the 2 * 2 matrix we then discuss how the two systems meet the 7 requirements identified before concluding the paper...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} {{the ways in}} which participants in mobile-phone conversations orient to each other's location, activities, and availability. By looking at data from recorded mobile-phone <b>conversations,</b> <b>I</b> use a <b>conversation</b> analytic approach to make initial observations on the character of mobile-phone <b>conversations.</b> <b>I</b> found that the frequent question "what are you doing?" sometimes caused a location to be given as part of the answer which shows how location, activity, and availability are strongly related. The participants thus obtained information about location, when this was considered relevant, through asking about activity. Location seemed especially relevant if it provided information about a future meeting. In some of the conversations where it seemed there was something going on where the 'called party' was located, the 'caller' reacted by initiating the conversation with a strategy which gave the called party a chance to end the conversation. ...|$|R
2500|$|A third book of essays, Half Empty was {{published}} in September 2010. Rakoff said the book is [...] "essentially about pessimism and melancholy: all the other less than pleasant to feel emotions that because they are less than pleasant to feel have been more or less stricken from the public discourse but in fact have their uses and even a certain beauty to them". Rakoff argued that it is [...] "a defence of melancholy, pessimism, anxiety {{and all of the}} emotions that have been tarred with the brush of negativity and therefore stricken from the larger cultural <b>conversation.</b> <b>I</b> hope to argue...that, while these emotions may well be hedonistically less pleasant, they remain necessary and even beautiful at times."

In the years 1969 to 1972 L'Europeo published a series of her challenging interviews with prominent politicians such as Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, Henry Kissinger, Yasser Arafat, Deng Xiaoping, Fidel Castro and Ayatollah Khomeini. The interviews were often translated and published in the world's most prestigious publications. She harangued Kissinger into calling the Vietnam War [...] "useless."
