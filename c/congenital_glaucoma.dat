40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} {{study was to investigate}} the epidemiology and the risk factors of feline glaucoma presented between 1990 and 2011. Methods: Detailed information was obtained from case records. Glaucoma was classified as congenital, primary, or secondary. Data was evaluated for breed, gender, age at presentation, intraocular pressure, character of glaucoma, as well as etiology of secondary glaucoma. Results: A total of 124 cats with glaucoma were diagnosed between 1990 and 2011, 114 of which had secondary glaucoma 5 primary, and 2 <b>congenital</b> <b>glaucomas.</b> Three end-stage glaucomas could not be classified. The mean age at diagnosis was 9. 7 ± 3. 1 years, with a range between 30 days and 24 years. In ten different breeds the overall female:male ratio in all 124 cases was 1 : 1, 8 (44 female and 80 male cats). The most common risk factors for development of secondary glaucoma were anterior uveitis (58. 3 %), intraocular neoplasia (17, 1 %), and lens luxation (7 %). In 45 cats with secondary glaucoma the cause for uveitis was recorded: idiopathic (35. 7 %), Toxoplasma gondii (31. 3 %), trauma (22. 2 %), corona virus infection (8. 9 %), and feline leukemia virus infection (1. 9 %). Seventeen of the 20 cats with intraocular neoplasia had iris melanoma, and one each had a ciliary body adenoma/adenocarcinoma, lymphoma and metastatic neoplasia from a distant site. Conclusion: Most glaucomas were unilateral and secondary to other eye conditions. Nine risk factors for secondary glaucoma were identified, with anterior uveitis, intraocular neoplasia and lens luxation being the most prevalent. This is in agreement with similar earlier studies.

40|$|Inositol phosphatases are {{important}} regulators of cell signaling, polarity, and vesicular trafficking. Mutations in OCRL, an inositol polyphosphate 5 -phosphatase, result in Oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe, an X-linked recessive disorder that presents with <b>congenital</b> cataracts, <b>glaucoma,</b> renal dysfunction and mental retardation. INPP 5 B is a paralog of OCRL and shares similar structural domains. The roles of OCRL and INPP 5 B {{in the development}} of cataracts and glaucoma are not understood. Using ocular tissues, this study finds low levels of INPP 5 B present in human trabecular meshwork but high levels in murine trabecular meshwork. In contrast, OCRL is localized in the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal endothelial cells in both human and murine eyes. In cultured human retinal pigmented epithelial cells, INPP 5 B was observed in the primary cilia. A functional role for INPP 5 B is revealed by defects in cilia formation in cells with silenced expression of INPP 5 B. This is further supported by the defective cilia formation in zebrafish Kupffer’s vesicles and in cilia-dependent melanosome transport assays in inpp 5 b morphants. Taken together, this study indicates that OCRL and INPP 5 B are differentially expressed in the human and murine eyes, and play compensatory roles in cilia development...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} effectiveness of trabeculectomy with mitomycin C {{in the management of}} childhood glaucoma. INTRODUCTION: The use of antifibrotic agents enhances the success of trabeculectomy performed in both adults and children. METHODS: A retrospective chart review (1991 - 2001) of 114 patients (114 eyes) from 0 - 14 years of age with <b>congenital</b> or developmental <b>glaucoma.</b> These patients underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin but had not been previously treated with any antifibrotic agent. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 57. 36 51. 14 months (range: 0. 5 - 168 months). Treatment was considered successful in 63 eyes (55. 26 %), with a mean intraocular pressure of 12. 11 3. 98 mmHg. For patients categorized as successfully treated, the mean follow-up time was 61. 16 26. 13 months (range 12 - 113 months). A post-surgical intraocular pressure of < 16 was observed in 47 eyes. The life-table success rates for intraocular pressure control at 24, 36, 48, and 60 months were 90. 2 %, 78. 7 %, 60. 7 % and 50. 8 %, respectively. The cumulative probability of failure was 40. 8 % at 12 months. Following surgery, endophthalmitis appeared in eight eyes (4. 88 %) after an average 36. 96 months (range: 1. 7 - 106 months). Other complications included expulsive hemorrhage, flat anterior chamber and bleb leak. DISCUSSION: It has been reported in pediatric patients that trabeculectomy without adjunctive antimetabolites achieves a successful outcome in 30 % to 50 % of cases. In our study, treatment was considered successful in 63 eyes (55. 26 %) within 61. 16 26. 13 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Trabeculectomy with mitomycin is safe and effective for short-term or long-term treatment of <b>congenital</b> or developmental <b>glaucoma.</b> The frequency of bleb-related endophthalmitis was no higher in these patients than that described in adults...|$|R

40|$|Oculocerebral renal {{syndrome}} of Lowe (OCRL or Lowe syndrome), {{a severe}} X-linked congenital disorder characterized by <b>congenital</b> cataracts and <b>glaucoma,</b> mental retardation and kidney dysfunction, {{is caused by}} mutations in the OCRL gene. OCRL is a phosphoinositide 5 -phosphatase that interacts with small GTPases and is involved in intracellular trafficking. Despite extensive studies, {{it is unclear how}} OCRL mutations result in a myriad of phenotypes found in Lowe syndrome. Our results show that OCRL localizes to the primary cilium of retinal pigment epithelial cells, fibroblasts and kidney tubular cells. Lowe syndrome-associated mutations in OCRL result in shortened cilia and this phenotype can be rescued by the introduction of wild-type OCRL; in vivo, knockdown of ocrl in zebrafish embryos results in defective cilia formation in Kupffer vesicles and cilia-dependent phenotypes. Cumulatively, our data provide evidence for a role of OCRL in cilia maintenance and suggest the involvement of ciliary dysfunction in the manifestation of Lowe syndrome. © The Author 2012.

The characteristic facial port-wine stain, involving the first branch of the trigeminal nerve and the embryonic vasculature distribution in this area, leads to several ocular complications of the anterior segment and can involve the eyelids and conjunctiva. The posterior segment of the eyes is also affected with diffuse choroidal hemangiomas. However, the most frequent ocular comorbidity is glaucoma with a prevalence rate ranging from 30 %– 70 %. Glaucoma is related to anterior chamber malformations, high episcleral venous pressure (EVP), and changes in ocular hemodynamics. Glaucoma can be diagnosed at birth, but the disease can also develop during childhood and in adults. The management of glaucoma in Sturge–Weber syndrome patients is particularly challenging because of early onset, frequently associated severe visual field impairment at the time of diagnosis, and unresponsiveness to standard treatment. Several surgical approaches have been proposed, but long-term prognosis for both intraocular pressure control and visual function remains unsatisfactory in these patients. Choroidal hemangiomas may also lead to visual impairment thorough exudative retinal detachment and macular edema. Treatment of exudative hemangioma complications is aimed at destructing the tumor or decreasing tumor leakage.

We identified a heterozygous putatively pathogenic mutation of COL 4 A 1 in a 50 -year-old female with a history of <b>congenital</b> cataracts and <b>glaucoma</b> who presented with multiple diffusion-positive infarcts and areas of contrast enhancement following mild head trauma. We believe that this presentation of multiple areas of acute brain and vascular injury in the setting of mild head trauma is a new manifestation of this genetic disorder. Imaging findings of multiple acute infarcts and regions of contrast enhancement with associated asymptomatic old deep microhemorrhages and leukomalacia in adults after head trauma should raise a high suspicion for a COL 4 A 1 genetic disorder. Radiographic patterns of significant leukoaraiosis and deep microhemorrhages can also be seen in patients with long-standing vasculopathy associated with hypertension, which our patient lacked.
