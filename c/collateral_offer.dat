Group-lending, {{on the other}} hand, has found several advantages {{in the context of}} poor borrowers with no <b>collateral</b> to <b>offer.</b> An important advantage is that the bank 2 ̆ 019 s losses due to unsuccessful projects are dramatically reduced, because group members cover at least part of those losses.

We show that with individual lending, the typical situation for poor entrepreneurs in developing countries is likely to lead to a separating equilibrium where only high-risk borrowers are served (at a high interest rate). Allowing for group-lending, however, is likely to result in a pooling equilibrium, where all entrepreneurs are served at a considerably lower interest rate. We complement the theoretical analysis by a comparison of the performance of Bolivia 2 ̆ 019 s BancoSol, which practices group-lending, with the other private Bolivian banks, which lend on an individual basis...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{present a}} new {{approach}} route for recanalization of a chronically occluded superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Technique: Percutaneous treatment of an SMA occlusion can be accomplished in some cases via retrograde crossing through collaterals from the celiac artery. From a right common femoral artery (CFA) approach, an 8 -F RDC guide catheter is advanced to {{the origin of the}} celiac artery via. Using a 5 -F angled Glidecath, a long 0. 035 -inch stiff Glidewire, and a Choice PT wire, the glide catheter is advanced via the celiac artery into the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. Using the angled Glidewire and the Choice PT wire, the occluded SMA is cannulated in a retrograde fashion. Through an 8 -F sheath in the left CFA, an 8 -F RDC guide catheter is advanced into the abdominal aorta. A goose neck snare is used to capture the Choice wire, which is withdrawn through the left catheter and sheath. The SMA occlusion is dilated, and the RDC guide is advanced into the SMA origin over the balloon. Another Choice PT wire and a 0. 035 -inch Wholey High Torque wire are placed in an antegrade fashion through the now open SMA. Angioplasty and stenting are then completed in the SMA over the Wholey wire.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in microfinance is to solve asymmetric information and cost concerns related to serving poor customers {{with little or no}} collateral, in order to offer poor people and small businesses access to financial services. In resent times the industry has been critiqued for maintaining harsh collection practices and charging too high interest rates to their clients. The microfinance mission of serving the poor has been questioned from several holds. There are sufficient previous studies that show that the interest rate to a great extent is driven by the operating costs in the institutions. Identifying the drivers of the operating costs thus becomes necessary in order to lower interest rates offered to the customers. The critique on collection practices is not uncalled for. Frequent collection of repayment is in the microfinance industry generally viewed as an essential component in reducing the risk of default, which historically has been a prominent goal of microfinance institutions {{due to the lack of}} <b>collateral</b> <b>offered</b> by their clients. The lack of credit history further adds to the need to manage risk, but with little background information allocation of resources becomes problematic. Transaction costs are therefore high in the industry. It is a paradox that the world’s poorest are charged with the highest cost of capital, and the industry faces a need for lower interest rates in order to help more people. This study investigates the relationship between default rates and operating costs in the microfinance sector, and looks into whether the microfinance sector over time has been too concerned with lowering default rates. Has the focus on default rates left the microfinance institutions with too high operating costs due to extensive transaction costs connected to monitoring, control and collection practices? Would they be better off by allowing for higher levels of default and lower transaction costs...|$|R

Moreover, we obtain a sufficient and necessary condition under which the optimal stopping time is finite with probability one. In the finite-maturity case, we provide analytical approximations to both stock loan prices and deltas by solving an ordinary integro-differential equation {{as well as a}} complicated non-linear system.

50|$|A private {{student loan}} is a {{financing}} option {{for higher education}} in the United States that can supplement, but should not replace, federal loans, such as Stafford loans, Perkins loans and PLUS loans. Private loans, which are heavily advertised, do not have the forbearance and deferral options available with federal loans (which are never advertised). In contrast with federal subsidized loans, interest accrues while the student is in college, although repayment may not begin until after graduation. While unsubsidized federal loans do have interest charges while the student is studying, private student loan rates are higher, sometimes much higher. Fees vary greatly, and legal cases have reported fees reaching 50% of amount of the loan. Although traditionally unsecured, these loans are increasingly secured, so that the borrower must <b>offer</b> <b>collateral</b> or a third-party guarantee of repayment.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the underground economy and financial development in a model of tax evasion and bank intermediation.

Asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders implies a menu of loan contracts that induce self-selection in a separating equilibrium. Faced with these contracts, agents choose how much of their income to declare by trading off their incentives to <b>offer</b> <b>collateral</b> against their disincentives to comply with tax obligations. The key implication of the analysis is that the marginal net benefit of income disclosure increases with the level of financial development. Thus, in accordance with empirical observation, we establish the result that the lower is the stage of such development, the higher is the incidence of tax evasion and the greater is the size of the underground economy...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five chapters. Chapter 1 and 2 The first chapter presents the introduction and the summary {{and the second}} chapter provides details on the survey and the data collection. Chapter 3 The demand and supply of credit in the rural finance markets are investigated in this paper using data on 989 households, in Orissa, India. The aim is to {{study the effects of}} household, farm productive characteristics and the policy variables on the demand and supply of credit. A type 3 Tobit model is estimated which corrects for sample selection and endogeniety bias. In addition, a generalised Double Hurdle model is estimated where the household's access to credit is treated distinctly from decisions about the interest rate charged. The results from the type 3 tobit model suggest that the size of the operational holdings, net-wealth, the dependency ratio, educational level of the household and the wages and output prices are important determinants of the demand and supply of credit. The Double Hurdle model suggests the important result that the size of land owned plays a crucial role in whether the household obtains a loan or not. Chapter 4 Based on the 'Rural Credit Market Survey of the Puri district in India', this paper investigates evidence on segmentation in the rural credit markets of Puri district. It further investigates the presence of any systematic association between the type of <b>collateral</b> <b>offered</b> by the household and the rate of interest at which it borrows. The data shows differences in the loan characteristics between the households borrowing from the formal and the informal sector. The empirical results confirm the presence of segmentation in the Puri credit market. For the households borrowing from the informal sector and the moneylenders, evidence also shows that the marketability of the collateral is inversely related to the interest rate. However, no such clear relationship is found for households borrowing from the formal sector. Chapter 5 In the theoretical and the empirical literature on rural credit markets it is widely assumed that the households are credit rationed in the formal sector, which offers subsidised credit. This view rests on the assumptions that all households have a positive demand for formal credit and that it is the cheaper source of credit. Three different models of formal credit rationing are estimated in this paper. The first model is a conventional credit-rationing model. The second model assumes that the probability to borrow from the formal sector is jointly determined by the demand for credit and the decision of the bank on access. Finally, the third model relaxes both these assumptions and the household chooses between borrowing from the formal or the informal sector. The results confirm that the access to the formal sector in the Puri rural credit markets is limited and that there exists a high demand for credit. This suggests a high degree of effective credit rationing by the formal sector in Puri...|$|R

Parallel to this, we find that the availability of credit lines in the main bank (measured by the unused credit lines as a proportion of total financial liabilities) depends positively on the assets of the firms, on its collateral, on a good credit history, and on close relationships with the main financial institution. This measure of availability of credit is less ambiguous than traditional measures like leverage, that are affected in opposite directions by demand and supply factors. The Argentine financial system seems to have substantially reduced the degree of asymmetric information through its public credit bureau system...|$|R

ABSTRACT: This study sought to investigate {{the factors that influence}} access to debt finance by Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) in Chwele Town, Bungoma County. The categories of firms under study were all registered MSEs in operation at the time. The study examined the following objectives: to determine the effect of Collateral security on access to debt finance, to establish effect of financial information on access to debt finance and to determine the effect of managerial competence on access to debt finance. The study employed a descriptive research design. The target population was 256 MSEs from which a sample size of 120 MSEs was selected using Nassiuma (2000) formula. Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. The raw data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression. The first study objective sought to establish the relationship between the Collateral security and access to debt finance by MSEs in Chwele Township. It was established that most of the respondents had not pledged Collateral security for finance while. Most of the indicated that the nature of the <b>Collateral</b> security <b>offered</b> was private property which included their land. The study further established that respondents who could not provide Collateral security had their finance requests declined.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} the secured status of 7, 619 commercial loans closed between December 1988, and January 2001. Our main finding, consistent with the argument that collateral helps avoid asymmetric information problems and reduces risk, is that firms with an S&P rating tend to secure loans less often than firms not rated by S&P. In addition, further supporting the notion that banks require collateral {{in the face of}} information asymmetry, our results suggest that larger firms, such as those with high sales figures and those listed on a U. S. stock exchange, are less likely to enter a secured loan agreement. Moreover, consistent with a credit risk argument, we find that firms with investment grade S&P senior debt ratings are less likely to secure loans, while those with an S&P rating at or below BB typically <b>offer</b> <b>collateral.</b> We also find that loan size is inversely related to the probability that a loan is secured, but loans with a longer maturity {{are more likely to be}} collateralized. Also, the evidence implies that the purpose of the loan and the industry of the borrower are significant in determining the likelihood that a loan is secured. JEL Classification: G 20; G 2...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} how collateral is used {{to finance}} a going concern. We focus on firms that <b>offer</b> <b>collateral</b> with significant debt capacity, and a setting where debt is unconditionally an optimal contract. A theory is developed in which firms endowed with better quality collateral use that collateral to finance new investment opportunities with unsecured debt, while firms endowed with lower quality collateral use secured debt. Better quality firms must also issue equity (at a cost) to separate themselves from lesser quality firms, implying lower leverage and greater uncommitted cash flow from operations with which to meet debt service requirements. Empirical evidence from Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) support predictions of the theory, where we find that firms with less reliance on secured debt and lower total leverage invest more, are valued more highly and financially outperform firms {{with higher levels of}} secured debt and total leverage. Our findings provide alternative perspective on risk-shifting and the value of free cash flow, and demonstrate limits to the benefits of leverage as it depends on debt capacity.

A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) {{from the perspective of}} the National Health Service (NHS) was performed in order to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing the use of octocog alfa in primary prophylaxis vs on-demand treatment. In the world, patients with Haemophilia A are approximately 110, 000 (about 3700 in Italy). Prophylaxis,compared to on-demand treatment, is proven to be more effective for prevention of bleedings and related complications, but also moderately more expensive (ICER= € 35, 036 /QALY). The introduction of totally protein-free full length recombinant FVIII concentrates (AdvateTM), eliminated risks of blood-borne pathogens transmission.

40|$|Local {{government}} financing vehicles (“LGFVs”) —companies capitalized {{and owned}} by local government and {{established for the}} purpose of raising funds for municipal infrastructure construction—emerged in China in the 1980 s {{as a response to the}} severe constraints on indebtedness by local governments themselves. The mushrooming of their number and indebtedness has sparked fears about their ability to repay the debt and the consequences of a default. In addition to taking on bank debt, a number of LGFVs have also issued bonds. While observers have questioned the value of <b>collateral</b> typically <b>offered</b> as security for the bonds, we know of no extensive analysis to date of the legal quality of the collateral: what exactly are the bondholders being promised, and what is the status of those promises in the Chinese legal system? This article is an attempt to answer that question, using data from two hand-collected samples of LGFV bond prospectuses from different regions in China in two different time periods. We find that current collateralization practices vary a great deal across bond issues and have changed over time, and discuss the legal and other problems attendant upon each type of backup. Remarkably, we find that unlike our initial sample of bond issues, recent bond issues virtually all state explicitly in the prospectus that they carry no security. Thus, the popular image of local governments wildly overpromising with guarantees they are not legally empowered to give seems, at least as far as recent bond issues are concerned, to be wholly wrong. This in turn calls into question the figures commonly provided for local government debt, since they often include LGFV debt that local government is neither legally nor morally obligated to pay. To be sure, they may wish to pay creditors voluntarily, but it is misleading to label as “debt” soft obligations of this nature. Creditors who have tried to force local governments to make good on their guarantees have uniformly failed, at most receiving half of what they sought. The argument that local governments have some politically enforceable obligation to pay on their guarantees does not seem supported by the evidence...|$|R
40|$|The credit {{delivery}} system in India comprises both {{formal and informal}} institutions. The formal system comprises commercial banks, regional rural banks and cooperatives, while the predominant informal sources of credit are commission agents, traders, friends and relatives, chit funds and more recently, self help groups. This paper has examined aspects like (i) who gets cheaper and who gets costly loans? (ii) how different borrowers and lenders are matched to each other? (iii) for what purpose households borrow (production, consumption, investment, social) ? and lastly, (iv) are informal sources exploitative? The paper has used Village Dynamic Studies in South Asia data for 18 Semi-Arid Tropics villages in India comprising 857 households for the year 2009. The study has found that informal borrowings from relatives, friends, traders and commission agents continue to form {{a major source of}} total borrowings in the rural India. Generally, borrowings from formal sources are for large amounts at a lower interest rate compared to from informal borrowings. However, the majority of formal borrowings are skewed towards large landholders, and upper caste households who can <b>offer</b> <b>collateral</b> securities and also benefit from crop loans, for which basic eligibility criteria for getting loans is land. The borrowings from informal sources have been found distributed across all class and caste groups uniformly as these are mostly inter-personal borrowings with no collateral securities. About half of the borrowings from friends and traders carry no interest rate, but for very small amounts and for a shorter duration. However, on average informal sources have been found charging three-times interest rates that of formal sources if we account for productinput-credit market linkages...|$|R
5000|$|Like regular banks, shadow banks provide {{credit and}} {{generally}} increase the liquidity {{of the financial}} sector. Yet unlike their more regulated competitors, they lack access to central bank funding or safety nets such as deposit insurance and debt guarantees. [...] In contrast to traditional banks, shadow banks do not take deposits. Instead, they rely on short-term funding provided either by asset-backed commercial paper or by the repo market, in which borrowers in substance <b>offer</b> <b>collateral</b> as security against a cash loan, through the mechanism of selling the security to a lender and agreeing to repurchase it at an agreed {{time in the future}} for an agreed price. Money market funds do not rely on short-term funding; rather, they are investment pools that provide short-term funding by investing in short-term debt instruments issued by banks, corporations, state and local governments, and other borrowers. The shadow banking sector operates across the American, European, and Chinese financial sectors, and in perceived tax havens worldwide. Shadow banks can be involved in the provision of long-term loans like mortgages, facilitating credit across the financial system by matching investors and borrowers individually or by becoming part of a chain involving numerous entities, some of which may be mainstream banks. Due in part to their specialized structure, shadow banks can sometimes provide credit more cost-efficiently than traditional banks. A headline study by the International Monetary Fund defines the two key functions of the shadow banking system as securitization - to create safe assets, and collateral intermediation - to help reduce counterparty risks and facilitate secured transactions. In the US, prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the shadow banking system had overtaken the regular banking system in supplying loans to various types of borrower; including businesses, home and car buyers, students and credit users. As they are often less risk averse than regular banks, entities from the shadow banking system will sometimes provide loans to borrowers who might otherwise be refused credit. Money market funds are considered more risk averse than regular banks and thus lack this risk characteristic.|$|R

Institutions have also faced difficulties in dealing effectively with a large number of small borrowers whose credit needs are small and frequent and their ability to <b>offer</b> <b>collaterals</b> is limited. Cumbersome procedures and risk perceptions of the banks have left a gap in serving the credit needs of the rural poor. This has led to a search for alternative policies, systems and procedures, saving and loan products, other complementary services, and new delivery mechanisms that would fulfill the requirements of the poor. It is in this context that micro credit has emerged as the most suitable and practical alternative to conventional banking in reaching the hitherto unreached poor population. Micro finance is the provision of a broad range of financial services - such as deposits, loans, payments, money transfers, and insurance - to the low-income households and their micro enterprises. The basic purpose of micro finance is to provide access to financial assistance, including credit to the poor, enabling them to start/expand micro enterprises and break out of poverty. Micro credit helps the poor in making available the credit and other financial services for improving their income and living standards. The micro credit program - which was formally heralded in 1992 with a modest pilot project of linking around 500 Self-help Groups - has made rapid strides in India, exhibiting considerable democratic functioning and group dynamism. The micro credit program in India is now the largest in the world. This book contains 45 scholarly papers in the field of micro finance in India, categorized in five parts: Micro Finance: General Observations. Micro Finance, Self-help Groups, and Financial Inclusion. Micro Finance, Poverty Alleviation, and Empowerment of Women. Technical Aspects of Micro Finance. Micro Finance: Case Studies in India and Abroad...|$|R
