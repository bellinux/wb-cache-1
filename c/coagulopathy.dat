5|$|Infection with P.falciparum {{may result}} in {{cerebral}} malaria, a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy. It is associated with retinal whitening, which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever. Enlarged spleen, enlarged liver or both of these, severe headache, low blood sugar, and hemoglobin in the urine with renal failure may occur. Complications may include spontaneous bleeding, <b>coagulopathy,</b> and shock.|$|E
5|$|The {{fatality}} rate highly {{depends on the}} severity of the bites and some other factors. Deaths can be exceptional and probably occur in less than 15% of all untreated cases (usually in 2–4 days from complications following blood volume deficit and a disseminated intravascular <b>coagulopathy),</b> although some reports show that severe envenomations have a 52% mortality rate.|$|E
5|$|Death caps {{have been}} {{reported}} to taste pleasant. This, coupled with the delay in the appearance of symptoms—during which time internal organs are being severely, sometimes irreparably, damaged—makes it particularly dangerous. Initially, symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which may lead to dehydration if left untreated, and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid–base disturbances. These first symptoms resolve two to three days after the ingestion. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substance in the blood. Kidney failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic kidney damage) and <b>coagulopathy</b> may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial bleeding, pancreatic inflammation, acute kidney failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
40|$|Interventional {{procedures}} {{in patients with}} <b>coagulopathies</b> carry a perceived risk of increased bleeding and complications. Acquired and inherited deficiencies of blood-clotting factors, thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, and effect of anticoagulation are common problems encountered by practicing clinical interventional radiologists.

5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of poisoning by A. ocreata are initially gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea and vomiting which may lead to dehydration and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid-base disturbances. The initial symptoms resolve {{two to three days}} after ingestion of the fungus. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. Renal failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic renal damage) and <b>coagulopathy</b> may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Overdoses of {{ingested}} iron {{can cause}} excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High {{blood levels of}} free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to {{the cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, <b>coagulopathy,</b> adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, {{is one of the most}} common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40mg/day.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reported}} poisonings resulting in death from {{the consumption of}} A.bisporigera were from near San Antonio, Mexico, in 1957, where a rancher, his wife, and three children consumed the fungus; only the man survived. Amanita poisoning {{is characterized by the}} following distinct stages: the incubation stage is an asymptomatic period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. In the gastrointestinal stage, about 6 to 16 hours after ingestion, there is onset of abdominal pain, explosive vomiting, and diarrhea for up to 24 hours, which may lead to dehydration, severe electrolyte imbalances, and shock. These early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as phalloidin. In the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after ingestion, clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as jaundice, hypoglycemia, acidosis, and hemorrhage appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of prothrombin and blood levels of ammonia, and the signs of hepatic encephalopathy and/or kidney failure appear. The risk factors for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years, short latency period between ingestion and onset of symptoms, severe <b>coagulopathy</b> (blood clotting disorder), severe hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), and rising serum creatinine levels.|$|E
25|$|Thrombin: a {{bleeding}} disorder occurs {{when there is}} a failure of clotting, such as with diseases known as <b>coagulopathies.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} causes of {{subcutaneous}} hematomas including ecchymoses. <b>Coagulopathies</b> such as Hemophilia A may cause ecchymosis formation in children. The medication betamethasone {{can have the}} adverse effect of causing echhymosis.|$|R
30|$|The {{incidence}} of haematoma varies from 0.5 to 6.1  % [11 – 13]. Causes may include multiple puncture attempts, <b>coagulopathies,</b> or an incorrect technique. Occasionally, drainage or surgical removal {{is required for}} a larger haematoma.|$|R
25|$|Laboratory {{findings}} include anemia, <b>coagulopathy,</b> and {{an elevated}} BUN-to-creatinine ratio.|$|E
25|$|Coagulation defects – {{the liver}} {{produces}} {{most of the}} coagulation factors and thus <b>coagulopathy</b> correlates with worsening liver disease.|$|E
25|$|All {{anticoagulants}} (including LMWH) {{should be}} used with caution in women with suspected <b>coagulopathy,</b> thrombocytopaenia, liver disease and nephropathy.|$|E
5000|$|... 4.8% {{tranexamic}} acid solution is sometimes {{used as an}} antifibrinolytic mouthwash to prevent bleeding during and after oral surgery in persons with <b>coagulopathies</b> (clotting disorders) or who are taking anticoagulants (blood thinners such as warfarin).|$|R
40|$|Intraoperative <b>coagulopathies</b> can be {{complex and}} {{difficult}} to treat. Its management is further obfuscated in patients with pre-existing bleeding disorders. Hemophilia C, is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder. Like in most hemophilias, the bleeding tendency is variable depending on the activity level of factor XI. However, because hemophilia C is less common than other <b>coagulopathies,</b> it is usually recognized only after inappropriate bleeding often overcorrected with blood products, exposing the patient to further risks. The purpose of this report is to describe the role of rotational thromboelastometryin the anesthetic management of a patient with hemophilia C undergoing debulking of a recurrent intra-abdominal and retroperitoneal liposarcoma...|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} is contraindicated in pregnancy. Therefore, {{women in the}} reproductive years may need a pregnancy test before a biopsy is taken {{to assure that the}} test is not done during a pregnancy. Other contraindications are pelvic inflammatory disease and <b>coagulopathies.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bite {{symptoms}} include massive tissue swelling, pain, ecchymosis, hemorrhagic blebs, and necrosis. Systemic symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, <b>coagulopathy,</b> clinical bleeding and hemolysis.|$|E
25|$|Hyperemesis gravidarum is {{considered}} a diagnosis of exclusion. HG {{can be associated with}} serious problems in the mother or baby, such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, <b>coagulopathy,</b> peripheral neuropathy.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{dangerous}} condition as there can be bleeding into the abdomen that results in low blood pressure and can be fatal. Other causes of death in people with an abdominal pregnancy include anemia, pulmonary embolus, <b>coagulopathy,</b> and infection.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{cardiovascular}} system is {{inextricably linked to}} blood, cardiology is relatively unconcerned with hematology and its diseases. Some obvious exceptions that affect {{the function of the}} heart would be blood tests (electrolyte disturbances, troponins), decreased oxygen carrying capacity (anemia, hypovolemic shock), and <b>coagulopathies.</b>|$|R

30|$|Introduction: Thromboelastography (TEG) is a {{diagnostic}} method {{designed for a}} global evaluation of coagulation. It is frequently used in the clinic {{for the evaluation of}} <b>coagulopathies</b> and as guide for intervention. There is insufficient information regarding thromboelastography findings in patients with sepsis and its correlation with Bleeding times.|$|R
25|$|A {{liver biopsy}} done via the transjugular route because of <b>coagulopathy</b> {{is not usually}} necessary, other than in {{occasional}} malignancies. As the evaluation continues, several important decisions have to be made; such as whether to admit the patient to an ICU, or whether to transfer the patient to a transplant facility. Consultation with the transplant center {{as early as possible}} is critical due to the possibility of rapid progression of ALF.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{symptoms}} of bothropic envenomation include immediate burning pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, headache, massive {{swelling of the}} bitten extremity, hemorrhagic blebs, local necrosis, bleeding from the nose and gums, ecchymosis, erythemia, hypotension, tachycardia, <b>coagulopathy</b> with hypofibrinogenemia and thrombocytopenia, hematemesis, melena, epistaxis, hematuria, intracerebral hemorrhage and renal failure secondary to hypotension and bilateral cortical necrosis. There is usually some discoloration around the bite site, and rashes may develop on the torso or the extremities.|$|E
25|$|Caterpillar hair {{can be a}} {{cause of}} human health problems. Caterpillar hairs {{sometimes}} have venoms in them and species from approximately 12 families of moths or butterflies worldwide can inflict serious human injuries ranging from urticarial dermatitis and atopic asthma to osteochondritis, consumption <b>coagulopathy,</b> renal failure, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Skin rashes are the most common, {{but there have been}} fatalities. Lonomia is a frequent cause of envenomation in Brazil, with 354 cases reported between 1989 and 2005. Lethality ranging up to 20% with death caused most often by intracranial hemorrhage.|$|E
40|$|Lower {{gastrointestinal}} hemorrhage {{accounts for}} approximately 20 % of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The most common causes of lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage in adults are diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, benign anorectal diseases, intestinal neoplasias, <b>coagulopathies</b> and arterio-venous malformations. Hemangiomas of gastrointestinal tract are rare. Mesenteric hemangiomas are also extremely rare...|$|R
50|$|Patients usually {{present with}} {{constitutional}} symptoms (malaise, weight loss, fatigue), and hepatosplenomegaly is commonly found on physical exam. Lymphadenopathy {{is also found}} to a lesser extent. Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, patients may initially present at a more advanced stage, with <b>coagulopathies,</b> hemophagocytic syndrome, and multi-organ failure.|$|R
40|$|Prevalence of <b>coagulopathies</b> (n= 6010) {{including}} factor VIII deficient (haemophilia A) individuals (n= 3205) {{were investigated}} and analysed in 24 provinces of Iran. For all <b>coagulopathies,</b> the prevalence (per 100, 000) {{was the highest}} with 24. 45 in Semnan (north east of Iran), followed by Hamadan (west) with 17. 56, the lowest was observed in Kordestan (west) as 0. 88, followed by Kohkiluyeh & Boyr-Ahmad (centre) and Esfahan (centre) as 1. 20 and 1. 32, respectively. For haemophilia A, the highest was observed also in Semnan as 14. 19, followed by Hamadan as 9. 81. The lowest was observed in Hormozgan (south east) as 0. 17, followed by Kohkiluyeh & Boyr-Ahmad as 0. 20. The analyses showed that a higher prevalence exited above a hypothetical geographical centre line, from west to east of Iran; a lower prevalence was observed below the line...|$|R
25|$|As no {{intravenous}} fluids used for initial resuscitation {{have been shown}} to be superior, warmed Lactated Ringer's solution continues to be the solution of choice. If blood products are needed, a greater use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets relative to packed red blood cells has been found to improve survival and lower overall blood product use; a ratio of 1:1:1 is recommended. The success of platelets has been attributed to the fact that they may prevent <b>coagulopathy</b> from developing. Cell salvage and autotransfusion also may be used.|$|E
25|$|Viperid venoms {{typically}} {{contain an}} abundance of protein-degrading enzymes, called proteases, that produce symptoms such as pain, strong local swelling and necrosis, blood loss from cardiovascular damage complicated by <b>coagulopathy,</b> and disruption of the blood-clotting system. Death is usually caused by collapse in blood pressure. This {{is in contrast to}} elapid venoms that generally contain neurotoxins that disable muscle contraction and cause paralysis. Death from elapid bites usually results from asphyxiation because the diaphragm can no longer contract. However, this rule does not always apply; some elapid bites include proteolytic symptoms typical of viperid bites, while some viperid bites produce neurotoxic symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for benefit of blood transfusions in GI bleed is poor with some evidence finding harm. In those in shock O-negative packed {{red blood cells}} are recommended. If large amounts of pack red blood cells are used additional platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be administered to prevent coagulopathies. In alcoholics FFP is suggested before confirmation of a <b>coagulopathy</b> due to presumed blood clotting problems. Evidence supports holding off on blood transfusions in those who have a hemoglobin greater than 7 to 8 g/dL and moderate bleeding, including in those with preexisting coronary artery disease.|$|E
40|$|A 2 ½-year-old girl {{developed}} a bilateral occipital infarct following severe gastroenteritis with bilateral vision of light perception. Evaluations for sickle cell anemia, hemolytic anemia and <b>coagulopathies</b> were negative. Cortical blindness is an uncommon but dramatic complication of gastroenteritis, hence {{the need of}} prompt hydration and other supportive measures to avoid irreversible visual loss or mental sequela...|$|R
50|$|The {{parasite}} also causes <b>coagulopathies.</b> Haematomas {{and prolonged}} bleeding {{are as a}} result of thrombocytopaenia (where clotting factors are decreased due to them binding to antigen - antibody complexes). Clotting factors V and VIII are also reduced. Hypochromic anaemia is another symptom, also used in diagnosis and is due to the parasite interfering with haemoglobin synthesis.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{tranexamic}} acid {{is the only}} option that is currently supported by a large, randomized, controlled clinical trial, and is given to people with major bleeding after trauma. There are several possible risks to treating <b>coagulopathies,</b> such as transfusion-related acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, major hemorrhage, and venous thromboembolism.|$|R
