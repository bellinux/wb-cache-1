40|$|A {{framework}} for linking long-term disability (LTD) <b>claims</b> <b>rates</b> to the macro-economy using the consumption-to-wealth ratio is developed from financial economic and option theories. Financial economic {{theory suggests that}} the consumption-to-wealth ratio reflects consumption smoothing and reveals expectations about future wealth.

40|$|Background: Although ageing workers face {{specific}} {{health and}} safety concerns, conflicting evidence exists regarding the effects of age on workplace injury rates and workers’ compensation claims. Aims: To examine injury and workers’ compensation <b>claim</b> <b>rates</b> by age and injury type in an aluminium smelter over a 9 -year period. Methods: Routinely collected data for workplace injuries and workers’ compensation claims were retrieved for the period from 1997 to 2005. Results: The study included a total of 709 workers who experienced 2281 at-work injuries and submitted 446 claims. In 1997, 16 % of employees were aged 50 or over; by 2005 that proportion had more than doubled to 35 %. Injury and <b>claim</b> <b>rates</b> in all age groups did not change significantly during this period. Workers younger than 30 years of age had the highest injury rates, with differences most significant for injuries other than sprains and strains. <b>Claim</b> <b>rates</b> {{were not significantly different}} across age groups. Conclusions: These findings do not provide evidence to support the notion that older workers sustain more injuries {{and are more likely to}} claim compensation for their injuries. Our findings demonstrate that in this workplace, older workers were able to maintain their ability to work safely. This contrasts with the finding that younger workers had the highest injury and <b>claim</b> <b>rates.</b> While adapting to the needs of an ageing workforce, employers should not lose sight of the need to nurture a strong culture of working safely among their youngest workers...|$|R

The analysis of workplace risks and risk factors associated with burns are critical to developing effective interventions in the future. Methods - This study examined accepted Rhode Island workers' compensation claims (n = 5, 619) from 1998 to 2002 to assess the rates and risks of occupational burns. Employment data from the Department of Labor's Current Population Survey (CPS) was used for the estimation of <b>claim</b> <b>rates</b> and shift analyses. Results - The overall burn rate was estimated to be 24. 3 per 10, 000 workers. The <b>claim</b> <b>rate</b> for workers under 25 years of age was almost double that for all other age groups. The average per-claim disability duration for claims requiring indemnity was 167. 9 days and average annual total cost of claims was $ 1, 010, 166.

40|$|Introduction: Ireland {{had one of}} {{the highest}} {{pharmaceutical}} spends per capita in the EU in 2012. The General Medical Services (GMS) scheme is the largest community drug scheme in Ireland with approximately 40 % of the population eligible for free drugs and appliances in 2012. The total cost of GMS prescriptions increased by 414 % between 1998 and 2012. This paper projects Irish GMS cost from 2016 to 2026 and examines the implications of the estimated impact on GMS expenditure. Method: Central Statistics Office (CSO) population projections (2013) and HSE-PCRS GMS population prescription data (2012) were used to develop four variables; population, GMS coverage, average cost per claimant and <b>claims</b> <b>rate.</b> A Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) model simulated the effect of these four variables on GMS costs, by health board region, age cohort and sex. Results: Irish population is projected to grow by approximately 10 % between 2012 and 2026. The over 70 s population is estimated to grow by 64 % with the proportion of males growing by 72 %. GMS expenditure is estimated to increase by 64 %, from € 1. 1 billion in 2016 to € 1. 8 billion by 2026. Age is a key driver of GMS expenditure, specifically those aged under 11 and over 70. The MCS results project that males, the Mid-Western and South Eastern regions are driving GMS costs in the under 11 s. Females, Midlands and Southern regions are driving GMS costs in the over 70 s. Conclusion: Population growth coupled with an aging population will impact future GMS costs. Targeted GMS policy changes such as co-payment charges, reference pricing, and generic substitution can help to contain future GMS expenditure...|$|E
40|$|MBA - WBSThe health {{insurance}} industry in South Africa {{has become increasingly}} re-regulated, where legislation enforces community rating, precluding the insurer a means to mitigate risk. Insurance institutions are also subject to adverse selection and moral hazard of consumers, resulting in products being most attractive to the unwell, elderly and those most likely to claim. Loyalty programmes have been launched in the retail, hospitality and travel industries {{as a means to}} attract and reward the most profitable consumer segments and retain these customers over a greater portion of their lifetime. Loyalty programmes are however a novel offering in the {{health insurance}} industry and have been launched with varying degrees of success, requiring an understanding of why a loyalty programme is needed and how it should be structured to achieve its objectives. In-depth interviews were conducted at a case site - the Vitality programme of Discovery Holdings. It was found that the Vitality programme was implemented to attract and retain young and health-conscious members through rewarding their health managing behaviour and providing differentiation. The Vitality programme has also demonstrated an ability to drive health managing-, loyal- and cost effective- behaviour improving the health indicators of its member base year on year, and potentially contributing towards a lower <b>claims</b> <b>rate</b> and lowered risk of chronic illness and disease in the long term. Discovery have used Vitality as a means to cross-sell other products and services to members. The programme follows a customer club structure and is multi-partner in nature. It is supported by sound financial analysis, is operated as an autonomous business unit and expected to be profitable and self-sustaining. Rewards have a high cash value, and are easily attainable and redeemable through broad earn opportunities and spend possibilities. Rewards are aspirational and have relevance to their target market. The tiered member structure is used to enhance the psychological benefit of belonging to the programme.

Fifty organisations that operate heavy vehicles and had either low or higher recent <b>claim</b> <b>rates</b> completed a questionnaire. These included various industry sectors, such as local government councils, utility companies, and freight transport companies. The questionnaire asked about the participants' use {{of a wide range of}} safety management practices relevant to heavy vehicle drivers. The results showed that despite controlling for fleet size, companies with larger fleets had poorer <b>claim</b> <b>rates.</b> The results also suggested that higher claimers relied more on setting criteria and rules for vehicles and drivers, than low claimers. Low claimers seemed to focus more strongly on proactive risk assessment, and that drivers are paid for time worked and consulted on safety issues. A number of the findings were counterintuitive. For example, higher claimers more often than low claimers reported that they did more checking during recruitment, had more policies and some accreditation as well as doing more in-vehicle monitoring. The study showed that there are safety management characteristics that distinguish between good and poorer safety performers but that further research must assess both the use and quality of the safety management practices implemented. © 2014...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A quick {{decision}} on implementation of countermeasures for quality problems {{is important for}} reducing the quality cost of electronic products.

Therefore, a {{quick decision}} on implementation of countermeasures may lead to misjudgment. On the other hand, {{until the end of the}} production period, there is an option to postpone the decision. When the option to postpone the decision is exercised, increased field claim data will reduce the uncertainty of the <b>claim</b> <b>rate.</b> Then the probability of misjudgment will decrease. However, postponing the decision may increase the number of inferior products before the countermeasures. In order to support the decision on implementation of countermeasures for quality problems under uncertainty, we propose a new method that combines Bayesian updating and real options. We evaluate the value of the option to postpone the decision qualitatively and show the possibility of reducing the quality cost...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{investigation}} of geographic variation in occupational injuries has received little attention. Young workers 15 to 24 years {{are of particular}} concern because they consistently show elevated occupational injury rates compared to older workers. The present study sought to: (a) to describe the geographic variation of work injuries; (b) to determine whether geographic variation remained after controlling for relevant demographic and job characteristics; (c) to identify the region-level factors that correlate with the geographic variation. Methods Using workers compensation claims and census data, we estimated <b>claim</b> <b>rates</b> per 100 full-time equivalents for 15 to 24 year olds in 46 regions in Ontario. A total of 21 region-level indicators were derived primarily from Census and Labour Force Survey data to reflect social and material deprivation of the region as well as demographic and employment characteristics of youth living in those areas. Results Descriptive findings showed substantial geographic variation in young worker injury rates, even after controlling for several job and demographic variables. Region-level characteristics such as greater residential stability were associated with low work injury rates. Also, regions with the lowest <b>claim</b> <b>rates</b> tended to have proportionally fewer cuts and burns than high-claim-rate regions. Conclusion The finding of substantial geographic variation in youth <b>claim</b> <b>rates</b> even after controlling for demographic and job factors can aid in targeting prevention resource. The association between region-level indicators such as residential stability and youth work injury suggests that work injury prevention strategies can be integrated with other local economic development measures.
