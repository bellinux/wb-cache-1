40|$|BACKGROUND: Few {{large-scale}} {{studies of}} epilepsy {{have been done}} in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of, treatment gap in, and possible risk factors for active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in Kenyan people aged 6 years or older living in a rural area. METHODS: We undertook a three-phase screening survey of 151, 408 individuals followed by a nested community case-control study. Treatment gap was defined as the proportion of cases of active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> without detectable amounts of antiepileptic drugs in blood. FINDINGS: Overall prevalence of active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> was 2. 9 per 1000 (95 % CI 2. 6 - 3. 2); after adjustment for non-response and sensitivity, prevalence was 4. 5 per 1000 (4. 1 - 4. 9). Substantial heterogeneity was noted in prevalence, with evidence of clustering. Treatment gap was 70. 3 % (65. 9 - 74. 5), with weak evidence of a difference by sex and area. Adjusted odds of active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> for all individuals were increased with a family history of non-febrile convulsions (odds ratio 3. 3, 95 % CI 2. 4 - 4. 7; p< 0. 0001), family history of febrile convulsions (14. 6, 6. 3 - 34. 1; p< 0. 0001), history of both seizure types (7. 3, 3. 3 - 16. 4; p< 0. 0001), and previous head injury (4. 1, 2. 1 - 8. 1; p< 0. 0001). Findings of multivariable analyses in children showed that adverse perinatal events (5. 7, 2. 6 - 12. 7; p< 0. 0001) and the child's mother being a widow (5. 1, 2. 4 - 11. 0; p< 0. 0001) raised the odds of active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> INTERPRETATION: Substantial heterogeneity exists in prevalence of active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in this rural area in Kenya. Assessment of prevalence, treatment use, and demographic variation in screening response helped to identify groups for targeted interventions. Adverse perinatal events, febrile illness, and head injury are potentially preventable associated factors for epilepsy in this region...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> seizure frequency and the outcome of pregnancy amongst a cohort of pregnant women attending antenatal clinic (ANC) at two tertiary hospitals. MethodsAn observational cohort study conducted at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital and State Specialist Hospital, Northeast Nigeria. Pregnant women attending antenatal care were screened for previous history of active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> and recruited consecutively according to a specified protocol. A standardized questionnaire was administered to record pregnancy history, nature of epilepsy and treatments received. They were followed-up {{during the course of}} the pregnancy based on the ANC schedule up to delivery. The outcome of pregnancies was recorded. ResultsA total of 7063 pregnant women were screened, of whom 103 (1. 46 %) subjects had at least a past history of seizure. Seventy-eight (1. 10 %) had a past history of seizure(s) from eclampsia and 23 (0. 33 %) pregnant subjects recruited were identified to have active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> The unadjusted prevalence of active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in pregnant women was found to be 3. 33 per 1000 (95 % CI: 2. 1 – 4. 8). Subjects who had a history of head injury and encephalitis were more likely to have seizures during pregnancy. (P= 0. 013 and P= 0. 041). Those who had recurrent seizures within the last six months before recruitment were more likely to have a negative pregnancy outcome (P= 0. 043). ConclusionOur study found a prevalence of active epilepsy of 3. 33 per 1000 among pregnant women, with about one percent having a past history of seizure from eclampsia...|$|E
40|$|Summary Objectives The {{burden of}} epilepsy, {{in terms of}} both {{morbidity}} and mortality, is likely to vary depending on the etiology (primary [genetic/unknown] vs. secondary [structural/metabolic]) and with the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).

25|$|A high {{concentration}} of Ca2+ induces excitotoxicity which {{is believed to be}} the main mechanism behind movement disorders such as ALS, Parkinson's disease, and <b>convulsive</b> disorders like <b>epilepsy.</b> Honokiol disrupts the interfaces post synaptic density protein (PSD95) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). PSD95 and nNOS coupling to the NMDA receptor causes a conformational change responsible for the intracellular influx of Ca2+ which could in turn be a pathway for neurotoxicity. Calcium overloading can also cause damage by over-activation of calcium-stimulated enzymes. Honokiol can reduce calcium influx through inhibition of the fMLP, AlF4−, and thapsigargin G-protein pathways.|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{reviewed}} {{literature and}} the data presented in this paper, conclusions can be drawn {{with respect to the}} validity of the WAG/Rij strain of rats as a model for absence epilepsy in humans. The view that the WAG/Rij model has "face validity" is supported by the simultaneous presence of clinical and electroencephalographic signs characterizing absences in rat and humans, by the decrease in responsiveness during the presence of spike-wave discharges in both species, by the agreement between model and patient with respect to the preferential occurrences of spike-wave discharges at transitions in states of vigilance, by the corresponding modulation of spike-wave discharges by physical and mental activities in both and, finally, by the fact that in both humans and rats absence epilepsy is inherited. Against this view, however, argue two points. In rats, absences appear after puberty and are maintained during life, while in humans the seizures occur before puberty and then disappear or convert to more serious forms of epilepsy. The second point is the frequency difference of the spikes and waves in the discharge train: 8 - 10 Hz in the rat and 3 Hz in the human (though there are no a priori reasons why the frequency of spike waves in the burst must be the same in all species). The absence model also has predictive validity, based on pharmacological data that demonstrate the specificity of certain drugs as being effective in <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsies</b> and not in absence epilepsy. So far, all drugs affect spike-wave activity the same way in rats and humans, with lamotrigine being, perhaps, the only exception. Furthermore, sleep deprivation is a powerful provocation for the initiation of spike-wave discharges in both rats and humans. Potential explanations for the presence of absence seizures in rats have been found at the levels of activities in networks and nuclei; of neurons, membrane properties, and ion channels; of proteins and enzymes; and, finally, of genes and chromosomes. Further descriptions of the cellular processes can be found extensively in the literature (e. g., McCormick and Contreras, 2001) and those of the thalamo-cortico-thalamic network in this review as well as in others (Avanzini et al., 1999). Considering the extensive involvement of the phenomena under study with theoretical issues such as the relationship between sleep spindles and spike-wave discharges, and the origin of seizure activity, it can be concluded that the model also has construct validity as far as the present neurobiological theories holding for absence epilepsy in humans are concerned. The WAG/Rij model can therefore be recommended for continued use in evaluating antiepileptic drugs for monotherapy and polytherapy, {{as well as for the}} toxicological side effects of putative new antiabsence drugs...|$|R
40|$|Mixed {{forms of}} {{epilepsy}} - the coexistence of <b>convulsive</b> and non-convulsive <b>epilepsy</b> {{in the same}} animal - have hardly been described. Mixed forms of epilepsy are refractory: {{they are the most}} difficult to treat. The possibility of the existence of audiogenic convulsive fits in WAG/Rij rats with absence epilepsy was studied in a large group of young and adult WAG/Rij. In 30 % of adult rats sound stimulation provoked an audiogenic fit of moderate intensity. The fit followed a two-wave pattern with a remarkable stable motionless interval between two excitation periods. Up to 20 % of young WAG/Rij rats were susceptible to audiogenic seizures with a longer latency, lower intensity, and with a simpler pattern than in adult rats. Since WAG/Rij rats demonstrate spontaneous spike-wave discharges characterising absence-epilepsy, the described subpopulation of rats seem to be a good subject to investigate characteristics and mechanisms of mixed forms of epilepsy...|$|R
40|$|Rationale Epilepsy is a common, chronic, {{neurological}} {{condition that}} disproportionately affects individuals living in low- and middle- income countries, including much of sub-Saharan Africa. Epilepsy is treatable, {{with the majority}} of individuals who take anti-epileptic drugs experiencing a reduction, or elimination, of seizures. Yet the number of individuals taking and adhering to medication in Africa is low and interventions aimed at improving treatment are lacking. Aims To define the epidemiology of <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in rural South Africa in terms of incidence, mortality and disability-adjusted life years; to determine outpatient, out-of-pocket costs resulting from epilepsy treatment; to establish the level of adherence to anti-epileptic drugs amongst people with epilepsy; and, to determine whether the introduction of routine visits to people with epilepsy by community health workers is a cost-effective intervention for improving adherence to anti-epileptic drugs. Methods Nested within the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System, this work utilized a cohort of individuals diagnosed with <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in 2008 to determine health care utilization and out-of-pocket costs due to care sought for epilepsy. Additionally, using blood samples from the cohort, anti-epileptic drug adherence was measured and, following the cohort, mortality rates were determined. Using these collected epidemiological parameters, disability-adjusted life years due to <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> were determined. Finally, combining the epidemiological and cost parameters, a community health worker intervention was modeled to determine its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Key Findings The burden of <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> is lower in rural South Africa than other parts of Africa, likely due to lower levels of known risk factors. Yet the burden, especially in terms of mortality, remains high, as does the treatment gap and health care utilization. Findings from the economic evaluation found the introduction of a community health worker to be highly cost-effective and would likely lower the burden of epilepsy in rural South Africa. Implications Epilepsy contributes to the burden of disease in rural South Africa, with high levels of mortality and a substantial treatment gap. The introduction of a community-health worker is likely to be one cost-effective, community based intervention that would lower the burden of epilepsy by improving adherence to anti-epileptic drugs. Implementing this intervention, based on these findings, is a justified and important next step...|$|E

MethodsA 3 phase cross-sectional descriptive study was done to survey individuals ≥ 15 years in 2 slums in Enugu, South East Nigeria. ResultsThe prevalence of epilepsy was 6. 0 (95 % CI: 5. 9 – 6. 0) per 1000 (men 4. 4 / 1000, 95 % CI: 2. 3 – 6. 4, women 7. 8 / 1000, 95 % CI: 4. 9 – 10. 4), p= 0. 06. The peak age of active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> was 40 – 44 years (11. 2 per 1000) with two smaller peaks at 25 – 29 and ≥ 50 years. The age and sex adjusted prevalence using WHO standard population and 2006 Nigerian census population were 5. 9 per 1000 (95 % CI: 4. 0 – 7. 9) and 5. 4 per 1000 (95 % CI: 3. 4 – 7. 4).

40|$|The {{disability}} adjusted life year (DALY) is {{a composite}} measure of disease burden that includes both morbidity and mortality, and is relevant to conditions such as epilepsy that can limit productive functioning. The 2010 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study introduced {{a number of new}} methods and definitions, including a prevalence-based approach and revised disability weights to calculate morbidity and new standard life expectancies to calculate premature mortality. We used these approaches, and local, population-based data, to estimate the burden of <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in rural South Africa. Comprehensive prevalence, incidence and mortality data on <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> were collected within the Agincourt sub-district in rural northeastern South Africa between 2008 and 2012. We estimated DALYs using both prevalence- and incidence-based approaches for calculating years of life lived with disability. Additionally, we explored how changing the disease model by varying the disability weights influenced DALY estimates. Using the prevalence-based approach, <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in Agincourt resulted in 332 DALYs (95 % uncertainty interval (UI) : 216 - 455) and 4. 1 DALYs per 1, 000 individuals (95 %UI: 2. 7 - 5. 7) annually. Of this, 26 % was due to morbidity while 74 % was due to premature mortality. DALYs increased by 10 % when using the incidence-based method. Varying the disability weight from 0. 072 (treated epilepsy, seizure free) to 0. 657 (severe epilepsy) caused years lived with disability to increase from 18 (95 %UI: 16 - 19) to 161 (95 %UI: 143 - 170). DALY estimates are influenced by both the methods applied and population parameters used in the calculation. Irrespective of method, a significant burden of epilepsy is due to premature mortality in rural South Africa, with a lower burden than rural Kenya. Researchers and national policymakers should carefully interrogate the methods and data used to calculate DALYs as this will influence policy priorities and resource allocation...|$|E
40|$|Our current {{knowledge}} {{of the role of}} astrocytes in health and disease states supports the view that many physiological brain functions and neurological diseases are finely tuned, and in certain cases fully determined, by the continuous cross-talk between astrocytes and neurons. This novel way of interpreting brain activity as a dynamic and reciprocal interplay between astrocytic and neuronal networks has also influenced our understanding of epilepsy, not only forcing a reinterpretation of old findings, but also being a catalyst for novel experimentation. In this review, we summarize some of the recent studies that highlight these novel distinct contributions of astrocytes to the expression of convulsive and non-convulsive epileptiform discharges and seizures. The emerging picture suggests a general framework based on bilateral signalling between astrocytes and neurons for a fuller understanding of epileptogenic and epileptic mechanisms in the brain network. Astrocytes potentially represent targets for the development of those novel chemical entities with improved efficacy for the treatment of <b>convulsive</b> and non-convulsive <b>epilepsy</b> that expert groups have {{recognized as one of the}} key priorities for the management of epilepsy...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of many years of research, the role of Herpesviridae IV, V and VI types in the {{structure}} of various pathologies in children (with infectious mononucleosis (MI), CNS damage, long-term subfebrile syndrome, vasculitis syndrome, hepatitis, etc.) has been proven. MI is a polyethological disease associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV 6), occurring in mono(58 %) and mixed infections in various combinations of herpesviruses (42 %). Clinical manifestations of MI are typical and do not depend on etiology. With CMV and HHV 6 IM, the response to heterophilic antibodies is always negative. Markers of herpesvirus infections were detected in 87 % of children observed with neurological pathology. Children with diagnoses such as <b>convulsive</b> syndrome, <b>epilepsy,</b> neuropathy need a comprehensive examination (ELISA, PCR, Indirect immunofluorescence reaction) to identify markers of active replication of herpes viruses, with an emphasis on the detection of HHV 6. In 44 % of cases, the role of active herpesvirus infection in the etiology of prolonged subfebrile fever in children was proven, with mixed forms (78 %) prevailing over monoinfection (22 %). To identify the active forms of herpesvirus infection, it is important to detect the markers of viral replication. For EBV, this is the DNA of the virus in the blood, a smear from the tonsils and saliva, antigens of the complete assembly of EBV in blood lymphocytes, antibodies to the capsid antigen (VCA) of IgM and IgG classes, and IgG to the early (EA) antigen. With CMV infection, complete virus assembly antigens (pp 65 and pp 72) in blood lymphocytes and/or DNA of the virus in the blood, virus DNA in saliva and urine, antibodies to the IgM class virus and high IgG class titer in the blood. With HHV 6 infection, the DNA of the virus in the blood, a smear from tonsils and saliva, complete antigens of HHV 6 in blood lymphocytes, specific IgM and/or IgG antibodies are 2 — 4 times higher than the diagnostic values. </p...|$|R
40|$|Seizure {{freedom is}} not {{achieved}} {{in a third}} of patietns who undergo temporal lobectomy for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The cause of such surgical failures is unclear. Assoicated pathologies, such as Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) IIIA, are described in the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification, but pre-operative electroclinical correlates, neuroimaging findings, and post-operative seizure outcomes have not been established for these entities. Furthermore, pathological gliosis is a common accompaniment of hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Few studies have correlated teh degree of gliosis with post-operative outcome. This was a retrospective study examining a cohort of children and adults (n= 73) who had undergone TLE surgery. Pre-operative features of patients' epilepsy, EEG, neuroimaging and post-operative outcome were compared to the underlying pathoogy (FCD IIIA and other pathologies). Pathological diagnosis was reviewed according to the ILAE classification. The degree of gliosis was ascertained in a subgroup (n= 43) with HS. Surgical specimens of hippocampus and neocortex were examined by immunohistochemistry for Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) to detect astrocytes, and for Cluster of Differentiation epitope (CD 68) to detect microglia, using quantitation of cell coutns and density of immunoreactivity. The results demonstrated FCD IIIA was a common pathology in this cohort. FCD IIIA had neuroimaging features distinguishing it from other pathologies. The pre-operative electroclinical features were similar to isolated HS, but significantly different from other pathologies. Surgical outcome was poorest in FCD IIIA in this cohort. Acute seizure burden at operation was correlated with reactive astrogliosis. Microglial activation was correlated {{with the presence of}} pre-operative bilateral <b>convulsive</b> seizures. <b>Epilepsy</b> chronicity was positively correlated with fibrillary gliosis in the hippocampus/neocortex. Pre-operative atrophy on MRI was correlated with the extent of neocortical gliosis. The degree of astrogliosis in CA 3 was significantly correlated with post-operative seizure outcome. In conclusion, this study provides comprehensive data on the electroclinical presentation, neuroimaging features and post-operative outcome for TLE patients with associated and acquired pathologies. This knowledge will enable clinicians to refine pre-operative counselling and post-operative management of epilepsy surgery patients...|$|R

The effects of the L-type calcium channel blocker nimodipine and the L-type channel opener BAY K 8644 on number and duration of these spike-wave discharges were investigated. In rats aged 84 - 94 weeks standard EEG electrodes were chronically implanted; animals were allowed to recover for 10 days. After a baseline registration, nimodipine 2. 2, 8. 8, and 35. 2 mg/kg or BAY K 8644 in dosages of 0. 12, 0. 47, and 1. 88 mg/kg was administered. A control group received the solvent. EEG recordings were made to evaluate drug effects. The highest dose of nimodipine {{increased the number of}} spike-wave discharges, whereas BAY K 8644 reduced the number of spike-wave discharges dose dependently. The highest dose of BAY K 8644 also induced fatal convulsions in 3 animals. Our results demonstrate that the L-type calcium antagonist nimodipine facilitates spike-wave discharges and that the L-type calcium agonist BAY K 8644 protects against these discharges, in contrast to previous results suggesting that calcium channel blockers act as antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and that calcium channel openers act as convulsants. Our results are a further example of the different pharmacologic profile of <b>convulsive</b> and nonconvulsive <b>epilepsy</b> and are also in contrast to what has been described for T-type calcium channel modulation.

We assessed the prevalence and risk factors of active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> across five centres in this region. Methods: We did large population-based cross-sectional and case-control studies in five Health and Demographic Surveillance System centres: Kilifi, Kenya (Dec 3, 2007 -July 31, 2008); Agincourt, South Africa (Aug 4, 2008 -Feb 27, 2009); Iganga-Mayuge, Uganda (Feb 2, 2009 -Oct 30, 2009); Ifakara, Tanzania (May 4, 2009 -Dec 31, 2009); and Kintampo, Ghana (Aug 2, 2010 -April 29, 2011). We used a three-stage screening process to identify people with active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> Prevalence was estimated as the ratio of confirmed cases to the population screened and was adjusted for sensitivity and attrition between stages. For each case, an age-matched control individual was randomly selected from the relevant centre's census database. Fieldworkers masked to the status of the person they were interviewing administered questionnaires to individuals with active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and control individuals to assess sociodemographic variables and historical risk factors (perinatal events, head injuries, and diet). Blood samples were taken from a randomly selected subgroup of 300 participants with epilepsy and 300 control individuals from each centre and were screened for antibodies to Toxocara canis, Toxoplasma gondii, Onchocerca volvulus, Plasmodium falciparum, Taenia solium, and HIV. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) with logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, education, employment, and marital status. Results: 586 607 residents in the study areas were screened in stage one, of whom 1711 were diagnosed as having active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> Prevalence adjusted for attrition and sensitivity varied between sites: 7 · 8 per 1000 people (95 % CI 7 · 5 - 8 · 2) in Kilifi, 7 · 0 (6 · 2 - 7 · 4) in Agincourt, 10 · 3 (9 · 5 - 11 · 1) in Iganga-Mayuge, 14 · 8 (13 · 8 - 15 · 4) in Ifakara, and 10 · 1 (9 · 5 - 10 · 7) in Kintampo. The 1711 individuals with the disorder and 2032 control individuals were given questionnaires. In children (aged < 18 years), the greatest relative increases in prevalence were associated with difficulties feeding, crying, or breathing after birth (OR 10 · 23, 95 % CI 5 · 85 - 17 · 88; p< 0 · 0001); abnormal antenatal periods (2 · 15, 1 · 53 - 3 · 02; p< 0 · 0001); and head injury (1 · 97, 1 · 28 - 3 · 03; p= 0 · 002). In adults (aged ≥ 18 years), the disorder was significantly associated with admission to hospital with malaria or fever (2 · 28, 1 · 06 - 4 · 92; p= 0 · 036), exposure to T canis (1 · 74, 1 · 27 - 2 · 40; p= 0 · 0006), exposure to T gondii (1 · 39, 1 · 05 - 1 · 84; p= 0 · 021), and exposure to O volvulus (2 · 23, 1 · 56 - 3 · 19; p< 0 · 0001). Hypertension (2 · 13, 1 · 08 - 4 · 20; p= 0 · 029) and exposure to T solium (7 · 03, 2 · 06 - 24 · 00; p= 0 · 002) were risk factors for adult-onset disease. Interpretation: The {{prevalence of}} active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> varies in sub-Saharan Africa and that the variation is probably a result of differences in risk factors.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of the new anticonvulsant drug tiagabine (TGB) is reuptake inhibition of GABA. What TGB will do against nonconvulsive epilepsy is unclear. GABA agonists such as muscimol and anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and phenytoin generally {{increase the number of}} spike-wave discharges (SWD). We wished to verify whether TGB would also facilitate the number of SWD in a genetic rat model for generalized absence epilepsy. Male WAGlRij rats with chronically implanted EEG electrodes were given either 0, 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg TGB intraperitoneally. The EEG was recorded for 1 h before and 2 h after drug administration. Behavior was recorded for 30 min postdrug; ambulation, passive behavior, and automatic behavior were scored. TGB dose-dependently increased both the number and duration of SWD. The effect on the number lasted 75 min; the effect on SWD duration lasted slightly longer, - 1. 5 h. TGB had no effects on behavior, and the effects on the background EEG were slight: Only the 25. 3 - 39. 0 -Hz band was enhanced. The most striking finding was the occurrence of type 2 SWD (Neurosci Lett 1986; 70 : 393 - 7), an occipital EEG transient. These brief (< 2 s) SWD occurred only after administration of the two highest TGB doses. The mean number was 104 after 10 mg/kg TGB. GABAergic drugs have opposite effects in <b>convulsive</b> and nonconvulsive <b>epilepsy.</b> The appearance of the brief type- 2 SWD is unique for TGB. They deserve some attention, considering their large number and the fact that all rats at the highest dose showed these phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{prolonged}} clonic seizures diminish antiepileptic {{activity of}} valproate against pentetrazol-evoked convulsions. G. HABEREK, T. TOM-CZYK, E. M. URBAÑSKA. Pol. J. Pharmacol., 2001, 53, 81 – 82. Prolonged seizures may alter the brain function in numerous ways. It {{is conceivable that}} they might lead to modifications of seizure susceptibility or anticonvulsive drug efficacy, however, only limited data address this issue. Therefore, we have decided to estimate the antiepileptic activity of drugs interfering with GABA-ergic neurotransmission in mice subjected to prolonged clonic seizures 2 weeks before, using pentetrazol test. The activity of valproate, but not diazepam or phenobarbital, was diminished in animals following repetitive clonic seizures. It might be hypothesized that in humans suffering from epilepsy, prolonged seizures in the past might contribute to the lowered efficacy of valproic acid later on. Key words: prolonged seizures, antiepileptic drugs, valproate, phenobarbital, diazepam correspondence G. Haberek, T. Tomczyk, E. M.

40|$|While {{epidemiological}} data suggest a female prevalence in human childhood- and adolescence-onset typical absence epilepsy syndromes, the sex difference {{is less clear}} in adult-onset syndromes. In addition, although there are more females than males diagnosed with typical absence epilepsy syndromes, there is a paucity of studies on sex differences in seizure frequency and semiology in patients diagnosed with any absence epilepsy syndrome. Moreover, it is unknown if there are sex differences in the prevalence or expression of atypical absence epilepsy syndromes. Surprisingly, most studies of animal models of absence epilepsy either did not investigate sex differences, or failed to find sex-dependent effects. However, various rodent models for atypical syndromes such as the AY 9944 model (prepubertal females show a higher incidence than prepubertal males), BN model (also with a higher prevalence in males) and the Gabra 1 deletion mouse in the C 57 BL/ 6 J strain offer unique possibilities for {{the investigation of the}} mechanisms involved in sex differences. Although the mechanistic bases for the sex differences in humans or these three models are not yet known, studies of the effects of sex hormones on seizures have offered some possibilities. The sex hormones progesterone, estradiol and testosterone exert diametrically opposite effects in genetic absence <b>epilepsy</b> and pharmacologically-evoked <b>convulsive</b> types of <b>epilepsy</b> models. In addition, acute pharmacological effects of progesterone on absence seizures during proestrus are opposite to those seen during pregnancy. 17 β-Estradiol has anti-absence seizure effects, but it is only active in atypical absence models. It is speculated that the pro-absence action of progesterone, and perhaps also the delayed pro-absence action of testosterone, are mediated through the neurosteroid allopregnanolone and its structural and functional homolog, androstanediol. These two steroids increase extrasynaptic thalamic tonic GABAergic inhibition by selectively targeting neurosteroid-selective subunits of GABAA receptors (GABAARs). Neurosteroids also modulate the expression of GABAAR containing the γ 2, α 4, and δ subunits. It is hypothesized that differences in subunit expression during pregnancy and ovarian cycle contribute to the opposite effects of progesterone in these two hormonal states...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{prevalence}} of epilepsy in sub-Saharan Africa {{seems to be}} higher than {{in other parts of the}} world, but estimates vary substantially for unknown reasons. We assessed the prevalence and risk factors of active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> across five centres in this region. MethodsWe did large population-based cross-sectional and case-control studies in five Health and Demographic Surveillance System centres: Kilifi, Kenya (Dec 3, 2007 –July 31, 2008); Agincourt, South Africa (Aug 4, 2008 –Feb 27, 2009); Iganga-Mayuge, Uganda (Feb 2, 2009 –Oct 30, 2009); Ifakara, Tanzania (May 4, 2009 –Dec 31, 2009); and Kintampo, Ghana (Aug 2, 2010 –April 29, 2011). We used a three-stage screening process to identify people with active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> Prevalence was estimated as the ratio of confirmed cases to the population screened and was adjusted for sensitivity and attrition between stages. For each case, an age-matched control individual was randomly selected from the relevant centre's census database. Fieldworkers masked to the status of the person they were interviewing administered questionnaires to individuals with active <b>convulsive</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and control individuals to assess sociodemographic variables and historical risk factors (perinatal events, head injuries, and diet). Blood samples were taken from a randomly selected subgroup of 300 participants with epilepsy and 300 control individuals from each centre and were screened for antibodies to Toxocara canis, Toxoplasma gondii, Onchocerca volvulus, Plasmodium falciparum, Taenia solium, and HIV.

Methods: In this prospective population-based study, people with ACE were identified in a cross-sectional survey and followed up regularly for 3 years, during which information on deaths and associated factors was collected. We used a validated verbal autopsy tool to establish putative causes of death. Age-specific rate ratios and standardized mortality ratios were estimated. Pois-son regression was used to identify mortality risk factors. Results: Therewere 61 deaths among 754 people with ACE, yielding a rate of 33. 3 / 1, 000 persons/ year. Overall standardized mortality ratio was 6. 5. Mortality was higher across all ACE age groups. Nonadherence to antiepileptic drugs (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 3. 37), cognitive impairment (aRR 4. 55), and age (501 years) (rate ratio 4. 56) were risk factors for premature mortality. Most deaths (56 %) were directly related to epilepsy, with prolonged seizures/possible status epilepticus (38 %) most frequently associated with death; some of these {{may have been due}} to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Possible SUDEP was the likely cause in another 7 %. Conclusion: Mortality in people with ACE was more than 6 -fold greater than expected. This may be reduced by improving treatment adherence and prompt management of prolonged seizures and supporting those with cognitive impairment. Neurology ® 2014; 82 : 1 –...|$|E
