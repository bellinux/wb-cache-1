5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the Center for Nanostructure Characterization at the Georgia Institute of Technology {{reported}} {{producing an}} electricity generating device (called flexible charge pump generator) delivering alternating current by stretching and releasing zinc oxide nanowires. This mini-generator <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> oscillating voltage up to 45 millivolts, converting close to {{seven percent of}} the applied mechanical energy into electricity. Researchers used wires with lengths of 0.2–0.3mm and diameters of three to five micrometers, but the device could be scaled down to smaller size.|$|E
5|$|Although {{poliovirus}} transmission {{has been}} interrupted {{in much of}} the world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> ongoing risk for the importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained. In November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers.|$|E

5|$|As in most Sonic series games, the Chaos Emeralds {{play a major}} role; {{they help}} Shadow {{remember}} his past and allow him to perform Chaos Control and Chaos Blast. Chaos Control allows Shadow to move more quickly in levels and slows time in boss battles, and Chaos Blast <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> explosion that destroys or severely damages all nearby enemies. Shadow can perform Chaos Control after the player fills the Hero Gauge by defeating Black Arms soldiers, and he can perform Chaos Blast after filling the Dark Gauge by defeating G.U.N. soldiers.|$|E
5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} lines the pawn push c4–c5 often brings {{positional}} gains to White. In the Rubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nbd2 Qe7 7.a3, after 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.e3 Bxd2+ 10.Qxd2 (see diagram at right) White gets the bishop pair and a space advantage. In {{order to build}} up on these potential advantages, the most common plan is to perform a minority attack on the queenside, {{with the goal of}} performing the pawn advance c4–c5 in favourable conditions. This push can yield several advantages to White: it enhances the prospects of the light-square bishop, it creates a half-open file to attack with the rooks, and it <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> isolated, backward pawn on d6 after the exchange c5xd6.|$|E
50|$|There {{is no one}} defined way to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> vexel, however, one archetypal way to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> vexel follows. Instead {{of using}} vector-based lines, shapes, and polygons to <b>create</b> <b>an</b> image, a vexel is {{typically}} <b>created</b> using <b>a</b> raster program's support for transparent layers. Each transparent layer is given a solid (or sometimes gradient) shape and a display ordering that when displayed together with other near shape layers appears to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> stepped-but-gradual color transition. In some cases, for more realism, gradients are used that remove the stepping in the color transitions to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> smoother, photo-realistic image.|$|R

5|$|On islands, birds can {{contribute}} {{as much as}} 60% of a cat's diet. In nearly all cases, however, the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds, and in some instances, eradication of cats has caused a 'mesopredator release' effect; where the suppression of top carnivores <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey. Domestic cats are, however, {{known to be a}} contributing factor to the decline of many species, a factor that has ultimately led, in some cases, to extinction. The South Island piopio, Chatham rail, the New Zealand merganser, and the common diving petrel are a few from a long list, with the most extreme case being the flightless Lyall's wren, which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery.|$|E
5|$|Orochimaru {{also appears}} in two light novels from the franchise. In Sasuke's Story, he aids Sasuke in a mission by {{providing}} him information of his target. Meanwhile, in Konoha Hiden {{he makes a}} cameo congratulating Naruto Uzumaki and Hinata Hyuga for their wedding. He also appears in the spin-off Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, which takes place 15 years after the main story, {{but he has a}} younger appearance, much to the confusion of the main characters. In the manga sequel , Orochimaru <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> artificial human based on his DNA, whom he names Mitsuki, and refers to him as his son. At some point, he sends Mitsuki to live in Konoha after helping Mitsuki find his independence and decide what path in life he prefers. In , Orochimaru is seen watching his son with his teammates.|$|E
5|$|Other {{cultural}} controls {{may be used}} {{in combination}} with crop rotation: Mulching the potato crop with straw early in the growing season may reduce the beetle’s ability to locate potato fields, and the mulch <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> environment that favours beetle's predators; Plastic-lined trenches have been used as pitfall traps to catch the beetles as they move toward a field of potatoes in the spring, exploiting their inability to fly immediately after emergence; Flamethrowers may also be used to kill the beetles when they are visible {{at the top of the}} plant's foliage.|$|E
2500|$|A common modern {{version of}} the omnipotence paradox is {{expressed}} in the question: [...] "Can [...] <b>create</b> <b>a</b> stone so heavy that it cannot lift it?"

The second group, for example, spends much of their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a personal space in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping of maple trees to make syrup, which they share {{with the rest of the}} school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon.

5|$|Termites use {{sophisticated}} {{means to}} control the temperatures of their mounds. As discussed above, the shape and orientation of the mounds of the Australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during the day. As the towers heat up, the solar chimney effect (stack effect) <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> updraft of air within the mound. Wind blowing across {{the tops of the}} towers enhances the circulation of air through the mounds, which also include side vents in their construction. The solar chimney effect has been in use for centuries in the Middle East and Near East for passive cooling, as well as in Europe by the Romans. It is only relatively recently, however, that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture. Especially in Africa, the stack effect has become a popular means to achieve natural ventilation and passive cooling in modern buildings.|$|E

5|$|The content {{ranges from}} {{extremely}} difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems on branches of mathematics not conventionally covered {{at school and}} often not at university level either, such as projective and complex geometry, functional equations and well-grounded number theory, of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required. Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, {{as there is a}} principle that anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the tale}} of Maya Sita told in the Ramayana adaptations is absent from the original, the concept of Maya Sita first appears in the epic itself. In the battle between Rama and Ravana, Indrajit – the son of Ravana – <b>creates</b> <b>an</b> {{illusion}}ary Sita (Maya Sita) and kills {{her in front of}} Rama's monkey general Hanuman, as a war tactic to dampen the spirits of Rama's army. The fooled Hanuman reports it to Rama, who is also dejected by the news. However, they soon realise that it must be an illusion of Indrajit. Another surrogate Sita appears in a later interpolation of the epic. At the end of the Ramayana, a golden image of Sita is subsisted for the real Sita to be on side of Rama in sacrifices, after Sita's abandonment by Rama when her chastity is questioned by his subjects.|$|E
