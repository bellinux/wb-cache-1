25|$|As {{the founder}} of Texas Distributors, Inc., Lowe served as the {{technical}} father, but he carried that title to a personal level too. Texas Distributors {{was not only a}} wholesaler and an air conditioning contractor that provided a service to its customers and, hopefully, made a profit—it provided a steady employment and financial security for those who chose to work there. The profit-sharing plans were designed to limit <b>cash</b> <b>outflow,</b> and that helped employees by helping the company, but they also offered employees the opportunity to establish financial resources beyond their biweekly paychecks.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{simplifications}} {{and greater}} safety, {{it is believed}} by Westinghouse {{that in spite of}} its size, analysis estimated a target total cost of electricity at about 4 ¢/kWh. [...] Given its small power and physical size, it is expected that multi-unit sites could be operated efficiently, Westinghouse estimates that a 3-unit site could be built in 9 years with a maximum <b>cash</b> <b>outflow</b> of 300 M$.

50|$|The LCR {{consists}} of two parts: the numerator {{is the value of}} HQLA, and the denominator {{consists of}} the total net <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> over a specified stress period (total expected <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> minus total expected cash inflows).|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} supply chain planning, there are cash flows {{resulting}} from configuration decisions, which {{are composed of}} <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> referring to location and capacity investments (e.g., opening of plant and warehouse locations and purchase of resources) and cash inflows resulting from location and capacity disinvestments. Additionally, there are <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> for the availability of plant and warehouse locations (e.g., rent, maintenance), <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> concerning procurement, production, storage and transport as well as <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> resulting from supplier business relations (e.g., receipt and inspection of raw materials) and market penetration (e.g., marketing and sales manager). The sum of all decisions creates the base for the supply chain operations. Cash inflows result from the commercialization at sales markets, but cannot be allocated to a single decision.|$|R
30|$|Cash flows {{according}} to supply chain operations: the resulting SC operations surpluses comprise accumulated components from Eq. (13). Cash inflows originate from sales. Procurement, production and transportation <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> {{are related to}} the relevant quantities. When company-owned locations (i.e., plants and warehouses) are operating on the one hand, or when external suppliers or markets are selected on the other hand, periodic availability <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> influence the surpluses. Time overlapping product storages at plant and warehouse locations lead to storage <b>cash</b> <b>outflows.</b> By the use of a technical parameter, the terms for the calculation of storage costs are omitted in time period t_E + 1, as the value of storage carryover {{at the end of the}} planning horizon is already considered within the residual value [cf. (2)].|$|R

50|$|On September 15, 2008, {{the holding}} company {{received}} a credit rating agency downgrade. From that date through September 24, 2008, WaMu experienced a bank run whereby customers withdrew $16.7 billion in deposits over those 9 days, and in excess of $22 billion in <b>cash</b> <b>outflow</b> since July 2008, both conditions which ultimately led the Office of Thrift Supervision to close the bank.|$|E
50|$|Cash Payments Journals record {{transactions}} that involve expenditures paid with cash. Source documents are likely receipts and cheque butts. The CPJ records the <b>cash</b> <b>outflow</b> of a business. If {{the owner of}} a business withdraws cash from the business an entry is made in the CPJ. Discount received is the cash discount received by a purchaser, it is an income item for the purchaser.|$|E
50|$|Payback {{period is}} usually {{expressed}} in years. Start by calculating Net Cash Flow for each year: Net Cash Flow Year 1 = Cash Inflow Year 1 - <b>Cash</b> <b>Outflow</b> Year 1. Then Cumulative Cash Flow = (Net Cash Flow Year 1 + Net Cash Flow Year 2 + Net Cash Flow Year 3, etc.) Accumulate by year until Cumulative Cash Flow {{is a positive}} number: that year is the payback year.|$|E
50|$|According to a 2015 {{article in}} the Trinidad Express Newspapers there are onshore oil {{deposits}} located in Cedros. However it is my opinion (Jennifer Bailey's) that given the current price of oil worldwide at 2016, the cost of extraction may involve considerable <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> {{which may not be}} receovered from the sale of oil in the near future, hence the <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> in certain companies may exceed the inflows at a point in time. Given the strategic importance of the extraction of oil, one may examine the needs of the shareholders in companies and their reserves now and over time.|$|R
30|$|Oil {{recovery}} estimation {{is based}} on the reservoir parameters of pore volume, oil saturation, past recovery techniques etc. The estimation of price depends on the cash inflows and <b>cash</b> <b>outflows.</b> <b>Cash</b> inflows depend on the oil production generation while <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> are generated by the operation, investments, maintenance, field development expenditures and other costs. A detailed IOR cost model is developed by the study of financial assumptions. These include capital costs relating the costs incurred by the compressor, pipe line, wells and capture facility plant. The model includes operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the lifting fluids for recycling the reproduced gas plus general and administrative costs. The model also accounts for the operation costs involved with CO 2 operation, royalties, severances and ad valorem taxes.|$|R
3000|$|Additionally to the {{investments}} I, the <b>cash</b> in- and <b>outflows</b> {{of the respective}} operational business have to be considered. There will be <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> O to ensure the continuous implementation and the support for sustainability. The more sustainability actions are implemented the more complex the integration with existing actions (investments I) and the more difficult to maintain a high sustainability maturity level {{over a long period}} of time. Therefore, a strictly monotonic increasing, strictly convex, and twice continuously differentiable function [...] O_ij^cur ([...] m_ij [...]) ∈ R_ 0 ^ + [...] (e.g., a quadratic function) can be applied to characterize the <b>cash</b> <b>outflows</b> O that come along with increasing the sustainability maturity level of each starting point P ij [...] by Δm ij [...].|$|R
50|$|A free {{cash flow}} of €302 million results after {{deducting}} investments in fixed assets from the net cash flow, which is €368 million above the prior year. Net payments amounting to €159 million {{were made in the}} current fiscal year for the acquisition of interests in affiliated companies of Luvata’s Rolled Products Division. Taking interest payments and received dividends into account, there is a <b>cash</b> <b>outflow</b> of €257 million from investing activities.|$|E
50|$|The good {{business}} performance {{had a positive}} effect on the IFRS gross cash flow, which at €792 million was €280 million up on the prior-year value (€512 million in the prior year). <b>Cash</b> <b>outflow</b> from the change in working capital amounted to €374 million, about €53 million below the comparable prior-year value. Overall, net cash flow in the reporting period amounted to €418 million, which was €333 million above the prior-year value.|$|E
5000|$|Yet {{retained}} earnings {{are different from}} dividends paid, because dividend payments represent a cash inflow to a company’s owners (shareholders) while {{retained earnings}} which are reinvested to produce growth are effectively an invested <b>cash</b> <b>outflow.</b> Therefore when the {{rate of return on}} equity is not equal to the discount rate, the present value of the future income generated by the retained earnings [...] must be considered rather than the amount of earnings retained today.|$|E

50|$|Additional {{complexity}} {{arises when}} the cash flow changes sign several times; i.e., it contains outflows {{in the midst}} or {{at the end of}} the project lifetime. The modified payback period algorithm may be applied then. First, the sum of all of the cash outflows is calculated. Then the cumulative positive cash flows are determined for each period. The modified payback is calculated as the moment in which the cumulative positive cash flow exceeds the total <b>cash</b> <b>outflow.</b>|$|E

For non maturity assets (such as overdrafts, credit card balances, drawn and undrawn lines of credit or any other off-balance sheet commitments), their movements as well as volume can be predict by making assumptions derived from examining historic data on client's behaviour.|$|E
