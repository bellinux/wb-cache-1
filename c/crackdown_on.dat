5|$|But {{in recent}} years, many {{businessmen}} have shifted their operations {{away from the}} town centre to other suburbs due to a large presence of illegal immigrants from Mindanao islands in the Philippines which has caused trouble, mostly crime such as theft and vandalism on public facility and also solid waste pollution in marine and coastal areas. But later in January 2003, an urban renewal project, was launched to revive the town centre as a commercial hub in Sandakan and since 2013, the Government of Malaysia has launched a major <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> illegal immigrants.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, the Royal Audiencia of Quito {{began to}} have {{economic}} problems; a lack of roads led to limited communications. Obrajes—a type of textile factory—had provided jobs, but now found themselves in decline, mainly due to a <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> smuggled European cloths {{and a series of}} natural disasters. Obrajes were replaced by haciendas, and the dominant groups continued to exploit the indigenous population.|$|E

5|$|General Adib Shishakli {{seized power}} in 1951, {{establishing}} a military-backed autocracy. Atrash participated in anti-Shishakli activity, including throwing explosives at Shishakli's residence in 1952, an action {{which resulted in}} Atrash's arrest. In 1953 Shishakli launched a <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> the Druze community, claiming they were being funded by Hashemite-ruled Jordan and Iraq to establish a Hashemite government in Syria. Jabal al-Druze was bombarded by government forces and Atrash's father Sultan was put under house arrest for his vocal criticism of Shishakli.|$|E
5|$|In late 1991, Syrian {{authorities}} arrested Nayyouf's {{wife and}} young {{daughter in a}} <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> members of the CDF in order to pressure Nayyouf to give himself up. On 10 January 1992, Nayyouf surrendered to authorities. After his arrest, Nayyouf was tortured at the Palestine Branch of Syrian Military Intelligence. Many of Nayyouf's colleagues in the CDF were also arrested, and at least 17 were tried alongside Nayyouf by the Syrian Supreme State Security Court (SSSC) in proceedings lasting from 29 February to 27 March 1992.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's {{political}} polarity {{continued to}} worsen after the Emancipation Proclamation (1863) made freeing the slaves a war goal. Many of the formerly pro-war Democrats moved to openly oppose the war, and Governor Morton began a <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> dissidents. During one notorious incident in May 1863, the governor had soldiers disrupt a Democratic state convention in Indianapolis, causing what would latter {{be referred to}} as the Battle of Pogue's Run. No regular session of the Indiana General Assembly was convened until June 1865.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to stop Slobodan Milošević's Serbian-led <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> KLA separatists and Albanian civilians in Kosovo, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23September 1998 to demand a ceasefire. Negotiations under US Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke broke down on 23March 1999, and he handed the matter to NATO, which started a 78-day bombing {{campaign}} on 24March 1999. Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of {{what was then the}} Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the crisis, NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces, the ACE Mobile Force (Land), to Albania as the Albania Force (AFOR), to deliver humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, protest against South Africa's {{apartheid}} regime reached {{the stage of}} seeking to exclude the nation from international sport. In 1956, government rules requiring separate events for whites and non-whites in South Africa were issued; non-whites received poorer facilities. Brundage initially opposed taking any action. The run-up to the 1960 Rome Olympics had seen tumult in South Africa, including the Sharpeville massacre and a <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> the African National Congress. Activists attempted to persuade Brundage that South Africa should be excluded from the Games. Brundage initially took the word of South African sport leaders that all citizens were able to compete for {{a place on the}} Olympic team, and that non-white South Africans simply were not good enough.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by the {{regional}} Arab Spring, Bahrain's Shia majority started large protests against its Sunni rulers in early 2011. The government initially allowed protests following a pre-dawn raid on protesters camped in Pearl Roundabout. A month later it requested security assistance from Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries and declared a three-month state of emergency. The government then launched a <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> the opposition that included conducting thousands of arrests and systematic torture. Almost daily clashes between protesters {{and security forces}} led to dozens of deaths. Protests, sometimes staged by opposition parties, were ongoing. More than 80 civilians and 13 policemen have been killed as of March 2014.|$|E
5|$|More {{people moved}} to Lajjun during the British mandate period, {{particularly}} in the late thirties, due to the British <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> participants in the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. The tomb of Yusuf Hamdan, a local leader of the revolt, {{is located in the}} village. Lajjun's economy grew rapidly {{as a result of the}} influx of the additional population. As the village expanded, it was divided into three quarters, one to the east, one to the west, and another known as Khirbat al-Khan. Each quarter was inhabited by one or more hamulas ("clans"); the al-Mahajina al-Tahta and al-Ghubariyya clans, the al-Jabbarin and al-Mahamid clans, and the al-Mahajina al-Fawqa clan.|$|E
5|$|The botched mission furthered Castro’s {{opposition}} to the Grau administration, and returning to Havana, he took {{a leading role in}} the student protests against the killing of a high school pupil by government bodyguards. The protests, accompanied by a U.S.-imposed <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> those considered communists, led to violent clashes between protesters and police in February 1948, in which Castro was badly beaten. At this point his public speeches took on a distinctively leftist slant, condemning the social and economic inequalities of Cuba, something in contrast to his former public criticisms, which had centered on condemning corruption and U.S. imperialism.|$|E

25|$|Following the attack, Pakistani {{authorities}} launched <b>crackdowns</b> <b>on</b> Afghan refugee settlements {{to apprehend}} illegal immigrants. During the period, at least 30,000 Afghans left for Afghanistan, {{out of which}} close to 2,000 were deported {{due to lack of}} legal documentation.|$|R
50|$|Iranian {{opposition}} groups urged Ban Ki-moon {{to use his}} attendance at the summit {{as a way to}} criticize the Iranian government over its <b>crackdowns</b> <b>on</b> political dissent, such as the house arrest of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi.|$|R
5|$|The {{history of}} Al Khawalid {{dates to the}} 1920s, when the Khalids opposed the British-led {{administrative}} reforms and launched a military <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> the Shia who supported the reforms. The perpetrators were later put before a court that sentenced them to exile. They gradually returned to Bahrain, where they were kept outside government despite developing personal relations with those in power. They regained some influence since the late 1960s, but remained outside the inner decision-making circle. During this period, {{senior members of the}} Khalids were critical of the ruling family, opposed political reforms and held a grudge against the British.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} effect of Peterloo was a <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> reform. The government instructed {{the police and}} courts {{to go after the}} journalists, presses and publication of the Manchester Observer. Wroe {{was arrested and charged with}} producing a seditious publication. Found guilty he was sentenced to twelve months in prison and fined £100. Outstanding court cases against the Manchester Observer were rushed through the courts and a continual change of sub-editors was not sufficient defence against a series of police raids, often on the suspicion that someone was writing a radical article. The Manchester Observer closed in February 1820.|$|E
5|$|A {{systemic}} transformation happening {{sooner rather}} than later was made possible by the Polish legislative elections of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody <b>crackdown</b> <b>on</b> the Tiananmen Square protesters in China. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the Sejm, while in the newly established Senate they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (the other seat went to an independent, who later switched to Solidarity). At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them. The communists suffered a catastrophic blow to their legitimacy.|$|E
50|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Youth Revolution in Yemen on 3 February 2011 affected the Yemen Observer, too. Particularly critical articles on the policy of Ali Abdullah Saleh and the often violent and brutal <b>crackdowns</b> <b>on</b> unarmed demonstrators brought trouble to the journalists.|$|R
5000|$|Two notable <b>crackdowns</b> <b>on</b> the Iranian press {{occurred}} on 7-11 August 1979, {{early in the}} Islamic Revolution when the Khomeini forces were consolidating control and dozens of non-Islamist newspapers were banned under a new press law banning [...] "counter-revolutionary policies and acts." ...|$|R
