40|$|Growing {{performance}} {{demands in}} the mechanical manufacturing field have {{lead to a}} great development of the machine tools domain, regarding especially the productivity and the manufacturing precision. When equipping a machine tool with an automatic tool changer and an automatic pallet mechanism, the obtained result is a machining center. For small series products, milling machining centers fulfill the precision and productivity requirements, through the advantages of a reduced auxiliary time and reduced operating errors. This paper presents a new technical solution of the rotary table indexing mechanism used on milling machining centers, which offers a very high positioning precision, by using a <b>curvic</b> <b>coupling</b> and a hydraulically driven table clamp/unclamp mechanism...|$|E
40|$|This report {{focuses on}} {{providing}} {{a foundation for}} further investigation into the inspection of fixed <b>CURVIC</b> <b>coupling</b> contact pattern by way of modern metrology techniques. Previous bodies of research have utilized coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) to analyze specific features of these couplings, but not the interaction between mating couplings at the areas of contact. It is hoped that this report will {{provide a basis for}} further research to improve the efficiency and reduce the ambiguity inherent in the current contact pattern inspection technique. This report contains a comparison between the results of traditional contact pattern inspection and those obtained by CMM. Test couplings were designed, manufactured, and inspected at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly). Methods used show a correspondence between the calculated distance between regressed surfaces and the amount of transfer seen from tooth to tooth, but are unable to provide the resolution necessary to make any determinations of what that contact may look like across one tooth surface...|$|E

They {{are used}} extensively within the aero-engine industry {{but can also}} be found in industria l gas turbines. The manufacture of Curvic couplings involves the precision cutting and grinding of mating teeth on the adjacent ends of the components; the assembly is then clamped together with bolts. The design objectives for aerospace transmissions, and hence the <b>Curvic</b> <b>coupling,</b> are to reduce manufacturing cost, weight and size. The experimental testing of Curvic couplings within an aero-engine environment is time consuming and expensive. The objective {{of this paper is to}} justify con®dence in the results from three-dimensional ®nite element (FE) contact analyses when investigating Curvic couplings. The accuracy of the FE analyses requires a ®ne mesh in the contact region and the capability to deal with stick-slip behaviour in multiple three-dimensional contact surfaces. A comparison of the results from a photoelastic test with the results from an FE analysis provides a validation of the FE contact method for use with Curvic couplings. The results presented in this paper indicate that the photoelastic results agree reasonably well with results of the FE method analyses...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{performed}} {{in order to}} improve the <b>curvic</b> <b>coupled</b> engagement of a dog clutch situated in the transfer case of a truck. The dog clutch is used to engage the so called all-wheel-drive system of the truck. If the driver tries to engage the all-wheel-drive when truck’s rear wheels already skid, due to a slippery surface a relative rotational speed in the dog clutch will occur. This relative rotational speed will cause the dog clutch to bounce back of itself before engagement, or to not engage at all. The dog clutch has been redesigned to prevent this. Dynamic simulations using MD Adams have been made for the existing model, for the models created in previous works, and for the new model in order to figure out which of them will show the most stable engagement, at high relative rotational speed. The implemented simulations show that better results can be obtained. Separation into two parts of the disc pushed by the fork, shows that dog clutch’s engagement is faster and more stable, comparing to the original model and the other created models. The new model shows better coupling in the whole range of the relative rotational speed from 50 up to 120 rpm...|$|R
40|$|Fracture {{mechanics}} {{analysis results}} are presented from the following structures/components analyzed at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) between 1982 and 1989 : space shuttle main engine (SSME), Hubble Space Telescope (HST), external tank attach ring, B- 1 stand LOX inner tank, and solid rocket booster (SRB). Results from the SSME high pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP) second stage blade parametric analysis determine a critical flaw size {{for a wide variety}} of stress intensity values. The engine 0212 failure analysis was a time dependent fracture life assessment. Results indicated that the disk ruptured due to an overspeed condition. Results also indicated that very small flaws in the <b>curvic</b> <b>coupling</b> area could propagate and lead to failure under normal operating conditions. It was strongly recommended that a nondestructive evaluation inspection schedule be implemented. The main ring of the HST, scheduled to launch in 1990, was analyzed by safe-life and fail-safe analyses. First safe-life inspection criteria curves for the ring inner and outer skins and the fore and aft channels were derived. Afterwards the skins and channels were determined to be fail-safe by analysis. A conservative safe-life analysis was done on the 270 redesign external tank attach ring. Results from the analysis were used to determine the nondestructive evaluation technique required...|$|E
