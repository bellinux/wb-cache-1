The original outline was for 12 issues, but it left room for improvisation and a few points were removed as the story progressed. They looked at past and present social movements for civil rights for inspiration for how one would progress and how people might respond to a movement for android rights. Luna wrote the first draft of issue one, then the two worked together to rewrite it.|$|E

5|$|After the merger, both {{restaurant}} chains continued {{operating under}} their respective titles, while major financial restructuring had begun.

By 1992, all restaurants assumed the name of Chuck E. Cheese’s Pizza. The name was then shortened to Chuck E.

5|$|Although {{the concept}} of chakra appears in the Indian mythology {{as well as in}} Buddhism and in some other belief systems, when asked in an interview, Kishimoto claimed that none of these {{influences}} were the basis for his use of the <b>concept</b> <b>in</b> Naruto.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Concerning the {{difficulty}} of learning science and reduced interest in science, {{the authors of this}} study searched for potential threshold concepts which are portals or gateways in the field of science (particularly chemistry). The nature of these concepts and how to overcome their troublesomeness were further questioned. For this study, 239 high school students completed chemistry II provided information about what difficult concepts and potential threshold <b>concepts</b> <b>in</b> high school chemistry are and how they affect learning chemistry. In particular, the mastery experience of the threshold <b>concepts</b> was explored <b>in</b> detail. Two, “mole and atomic structure ” were selected as threshold <b>concepts</b> <b>in</b> chemistry. Not only as important but also as threshold, this study emphasized the importance of the two <b>concepts</b> <b>in</b> terms of features characterizing them as threshold <b>concepts.</b> <b>In</b> particular, the features objectify subjective experiences of students and provide information describing the scientific meaning and distinctive nature of threshold <b>concepts</b> <b>in</b> science.

5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that {{it has been argued that}} it reflects an independent development of the <b>concept.</b> <b>In</b> chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} country's history, {{voluntary}} acquisition {{or exercise}} of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship. This concept was enshrined {{in a series of}} treaties between the United States and other countries (the Bancroft Treaties). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this <b>concept</b> <b>in</b> Afroyim v. Rusk (1967), as well as Vance v. Terrazas (1980), holding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred the Congress from revoking citizenship. However, Congress can revoke citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.|$|E
