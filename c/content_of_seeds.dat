40|$|In the {{cultivation}} of rape, the oil <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> must {{be regarded as a}} important factor as well as the seed yield. This studies aimed to research the basic materials in relation to cultivating technic and breeding for the increase of oil production, and were concerned with the ecological changes of the oil formation in rape seed under various conditions during seed development. I. Relation of oil formation to the morphological development <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> under several condition (1) In autumn seeded rape, oil formation was accelerated especially in later half period during seed development, and continued untill 55 days after flowering when dry weight <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> reached maximum. Iodine value and refractive index of oil decreased as seed matured. (2) The flowering period continued for about a month in autumn seeded rape, and therefore, as flowering was later, the rate of development <b>of</b> pod, <b>seed</b> and embryo and of oil formation became more rapidly. But oil <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> was lower in later flowering. It was confirmed that iodine value of oil decreased as seed matured. (3) In spring seeded rape at the high land, the rate <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> development and oil formation was extremly promoted because of high temperature even at the early stage <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> development. But the seed harvested had very low oil. Iodine value of oil, which was very low at the earliest stage of the oil formation, increased rapidly until the middle stage, and then decreased gradually. (4) It was clarified that oil formation in rape seed was closely combined with the development <b>of</b> <b>seed,</b> especially <b>of</b> embryo or cotyledon in which oil was synthesized and accumulated. The difference in the change of iodine value between autumn and spring seeded rapes was discussed. It was suggested that percent constitution of each fatty acid during oil formation was both influenced by the environmental and hereditable factors. II. Influence of natural environmental conditions on the oil formation <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> (1) It was confirmed experimentally that high temperature during seed development decreased the yield and oil <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed.</b> (2) When 50 % of the natural sun light was shaded during <b>seed</b> development, oil <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> decreased about 10 %. Shading from 30 to 15 days before maturation most profoundly effected on the oil <b>content</b> and yield <b>of</b> <b>seed.</b> (3) Excessive soil moisture decreased both the oil <b>content</b> and yield <b>of</b> <b>seed.</b> Under dry condition <b>of</b> soil, oil <b>content</b> was not lower than under moderate condition, but seed yield decreaced remarkably. (4) Year variation <b>of</b> oil <b>content</b> in rape seed was evident in similar variety at similar station. Relationship between this variation and weather condition of each year was discussed. Relatively low temperature, much sunshine and moderate precipitation during seed development may be favourable both for the high yield and the high oil <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed.</b> III. Influence <b>of</b> cultivating conditions on the oil formation <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> (1) Oil <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> was low on the area of high soil productivity, and was high on the area of low soil productivity. There {{was no significant difference in}} oil content between areas where soil productivity was shown to be uniform. It was considerable that available nitrogen was rich in such high productive soil. (2) With the increase <b>of</b> nitrogen application, <b>seed</b> yield increased and oil <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> decreased. In this case, increased application of potassium fertilizer with nitrogen did not decreased the oil content. (3) The oil <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> tended to behigher in direct sowing cultivation than in transplanting. Effect of delay in sowing time on the oil <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> seemed to be variable owing to the weather conditions during growing season and the varieties. Early type may be preferable in oil content to the later type under various conditions. Density of sowing had a little effect on the oil <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed...</b>|$|R

For each of these species, we recorded germination time courses on bare soil and two types of biological soil crusts; one composed predominantly of the tall moss Tortula ruralis and the other {{dominated by}} the short moss Bryum argenteum. On the short-moss crust, the final germination percentage was about half of that on bare soil. Also, the mean germination time was 4 days longer on short-mosses than on bare soil. In contrast to the short-moss crust, the tall-moss crust did not reduce the final germination percentage but increased the mean germination time. Similar results were observed in the four grasses studied. To investigate the mechanism by which moss crusts affected germination, we analyzed the water status of seeds on bare soil and moss crusts. Six days after seeding, the water <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> on bare soil was approximately twice that of seeds on tall- or short-moss crust.

The <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> jute bag came to the contact with air and their moisture contents was increased from initial moisture content and remained near to their Equilibrium Moisture content (EMC), moisture <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> jute bag was found increased from 8. 7 % to 16. 7 % within 69 days of storage. But increase <b>of</b> moisture <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> tin pot and poly bag was lower as compared to jute bag. As tin pot and poly bag {{was more or less}} air tight so the <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> these container could not come to the contact with ambient room air, resulting less change <b>of</b> their moisture <b>content</b> as compared to gunny or jute bag. Germination capacity <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> tin pot was found decreased from 90 % to 70. 3 % and 90 % to 67. 5 % in the <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> poly bag. Germination percentage <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> jute bag was found decreased from 90 to 62 % in 69 days of storage. So, the germination capacity was also found a little bit higher in tin than the <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> other containers. Considering three different containers, tin container has been proved much more safe and secured than jute or poly bag container...|$|R

However, warmth can decrease germination rates <b>of</b> the <b>seeds</b> and degrade the visual aspect and the protein <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seeds,</b> which would be problematic for the seed market.|$|R
