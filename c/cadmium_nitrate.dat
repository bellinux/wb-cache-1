5|$|Although cadmium {{usually has}} an {{oxidation}} state of +2, it also {{exists in the}} +1 state. Cadmium and its congeners are not always considered transition metals, in {{that they do not}} have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. Cadmium burns in air to form brown amorphous cadmium oxide (CdO); the crystalline form of this compound is a dark red which changes color when heated, similar to zinc oxide. Hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid dissolve cadmium by forming cadmium chloride (CdCl2), cadmium sulfate (CdSO4), or <b>cadmium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (Cd(NO3)2). The oxidation state +1 can be produced by dissolving cadmium in a mixture of cadmium chloride and aluminium chloride, forming the Cd22+ cation, which is similar to the Hg22+ cation in mercury(I) chloride.|$|E

40|$|The {{removal of}} dyes and others {{contaminants}} such as heavy metals from effluent remains {{a major problem}} for the textile industry. While coloured organic compounds generally impart only a minor fraction of the organic load to wastewater, their colours renders them aesthetically unacceptable. Many dye compounds and their intermediates are carcinogenic and difficult to remove by conventional wastewater treatment methods. Many physico-chemical methods have been used for textile wastewater treatment. However, they showed some disadvantages such as high treatment cost, low efficiency {{to a wide range of}} dyes and toxic sludge generation. Bioremediation based on microbial technologies for treating textile wastewater promise satisfactory contaminants removal due to the biodegradation and mineralization of contaminants into non-toxic compounds. Therefore, this research has focused on bioremediation of textile wastewater, especially in colour and heavy metals removal, using biofilm. The potential dye-degrader and heavy metal removal bacterial strains were first isolated from textile effluents. Screening studies of isolated strains for dye decolourization and heavy metals removal were carried out using filter sterilized textile effluent and simulated textile wastewater in batch scale. Further more, the selected bacterial strains were grown as biofilm on support matrices and the biofilm were used for bioremediation of textile wastewater in lab scale experiments. The biofilm structure was examined using electron-scanning microscope (SEM). Parameters such as colour intensity, aromatic amines, COD, BOD, pH, <b>cadmium,</b> copper, <b>nitrate,</b> phosphate, sulphate content were monitored during the experiment. Generally, it was found that there are three strains of bacteria, namely Bacillus cereus, Aeromonas caviae and Aeromonas hydrophilla, showed a good performance in decolourizing and degrading dyes.

30|$|The {{positive}} effect of 24 -epibrassinolide with some parameters {{did not occur}} exclusively {{in the presence of}} salt, indicating that the hormonal effect was not necessarily salt specific. However, the effect of the hormone evidently has greater importance in the presence of salt stress. The {{positive effect}} of 24 -epibrassinolide on nitrate levels for the C. cajan plants cultivated under salinity indicate increased uptake, leading to higher nitrate reductase activity, which in turn could explain the higher levels of free amino acids and soluble proteins. An increase in nitrate reductase activity was also reported by Anuradha and Rao (2001) following application of 24 -epibrassinolide in rice plants subjected to saline conditions. Possibly, brassinosteroids maintain the integrity of the cell membrane under stress conditions and consequently preserve the process of nitrate uptake. Hayat et al.

Their measurement was performed using a molecular absorption spectrophotometer (DR 2800). After homogenization of the mixture, the suspended solids were measured at a wavelength of 810  nm.
