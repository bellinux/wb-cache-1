5|$|In Britain and elsewhere, <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry</b> {{has created}} new habitat which has {{increased}} numbers, but these gains {{are likely to}} be temporary as the woodland develops and becomes unsuitable for nightjars. In the United Kingdom, it is red-listed as a cause for concern, and in Ireland it is close to extinction.|$|E
25|$|The {{south shore}} of the harbour, {{including}} Wytch Heath and Godlingstone Heath, is open heathland of little agricultural use. During the 20th century there was some afforestation with conifer plantations. Around Wareham Forest in the west this has been for <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry,</b> but on the southern shore the plantations conceal the Wytch Farm oil wells.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 CLFN {{through the}} Northern Boreal Initiative (NBI) began formal {{planning}} efforts to document aboriginal traditional knowledge to guide future <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry</b> opportunities. In {{partnership with the}} Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), they are developing a frame of reference for land use and planning using Community Based Land Use Planning {{under the authority of}} the Far North Act. In March 2013 they published a draft entitled, Community Based Land Use Planning.|$|E

25|$|The {{geological}} {{composition of}} the summit is predominantly quartzite.

The area around the summit includes a number of sites of historical interest including the former lead works at Ballycorus and the ruined church and round tower at Rathmichael.|$|E
25|$|In <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry,</b> the {{transplanting}} of crop {{trees in}} new locales often requires an accompanying ectomycorrhizal partner. This {{is especially true}} of trees that have a high degree of specificity for their mycobiont, or trees that are being planted far from their native habitat among novel fungal species. This has been shown time and again in plantations involving obligate ectomycorrhizal trees, such as Eucalyptus and Pinus species. Mass planting of these species often require human addition of inoculum from native EcM fungi in order for the trees to prosper.|$|E

500|$|The Suffolk Punch {{was used}} mainly for draught work on farms, {{but was also}} often used to pull heavy {{artillery}} in wartime. [...] Like other heavy horses, they were also used to pull non-motorised vans and other commercial vehicles. [...] Today, they are used for <b>commercial</b> <b>forestry</b> operations, for other draught work, and in advertising. [...] They are also used for crossbreeding, to produce heavy sport horses for use in hunter and show jumping competition. As {{a symbol of the}} county in which they are based, Ipswich Town F.C. incorporate a Suffolk Punch as a dominant part of their team crest.|$|E

40|$|Many {{tropical}} rivers {{are experiencing}} large and rapid {{changes in their}} water quality. Quantifying those features of the disturbed tropical forest landscape that are the dominant sources of sediment or agro-chemicals requires local hydrological research if commercially-viable forestry pratices are to be modified to maintain water quality. The findings presented illustrate how hydrological research in Malaysia is able to quantify the dominant sources of river sediments in areas distrubed by <b>commercial</b> tropical <b>forestry.</b> This is integrated {{with a discussion of}} the ways that so-called 'Reduced Impact Logging' practices in Malaysia can be used to mitigate the worst hydrological impacts...|$|R
