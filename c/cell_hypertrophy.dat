However, trans isomer is the most potent stimulator of epithelial <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> since clomifene is antagonistic at low doses and agonistic at high doses. The antagonist isomers may cause inhibitory estrogenic effects in the uterus and mammary cancers, but the estrogenic isomer could combine with novel receptors to produce estrogen-like effects in bone.|$|E

40|$|SummaryIn {{multicellular}} organisms, cell size is {{tightly controlled}} by nutrients and growth factors. Increasing ambient glucose induces enhanced protein synthesis and cell size. Continued exposure of cells to high glucose in vivo, as apparent under pathological conditions, results in <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and tissue damage. We demonstrate that activation of TGF-β signaling has {{a central role}} in glucose-induced <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> in fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Blocking the kinase activity of the TβRI receptor or loss of its expression prevented the effects of high glucose on protein synthesis and cell size. Exposure of cells to high glucose induced a rapid increase in cell surface levels of the TβRI and TβRII receptors and a rapid activation of TGF-β ligand by matrix metalloproteinases, including MMP- 2 and MMP- 9. The consequent autocrine TGF-β signaling in response to glucose led to Akt-TOR pathway activation. Accordingly, preventing MMP- 2 /MMP- 9 or TGF-β-induced TOR activation inhibited high glucose-induced <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy...</b>|$|E

Late-onset, stable changes in gene expression {{hold the key to}} understanding the molecular basis of {{chronic diseases}}. Renal failure is a common, but poorly understood complication of diabetes. Diabetic nephropathy begins with mesangial <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and hyperplasia, combined with excess matrix deposition. The vasoactive peptide endothelin promotes the mesangial cell hypertophy characteristic of diabetic nephropathy. In this study, we examined the signaling pathways and changes in gene expression required for endothelin-induced mesangial <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy.</b> Transcriptional profiling identified seven genes induced with slow kinetics by endothelin. Of these, p 8, which encodes a small basic helix–loop–helix protein, was most strongly and stably induced. p 8 is also induced in diabetic kidney. Mesangial <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and p 8 induction both require activation of the ERK, JNK/SAPK and PI- 3 -K pathways.

40|$|The {{durations}} of transmembrane action potentials recorded from single myocytes {{isolated from}} the endocardial surface of hypertrophied left ventricles of rats were increased, compared to the durations recorded from normal left ventricular cells at 36 - 37 °C. Exposure to phalloidin (1 - 20 μM, < 20 min), a specific stabilizer of the non-myofibrillar actin microfilament component of the cardiac cytoskeleton, {{had no effect on}} action potential duration of normal cells, but significantly shortened the prolonged action potentials of <b>hypertrophied</b> <b>cells.</b> Cytochalasin D (5 - 50 μM), a disrupter of the actin microfilaments, also had little effect on action potential duration of normal cells. However, cytochalasin D further increased the action potential duration of <b>hypertrophied</b> <b>cells</b> at 10 min exposure. The addition of phalloidin to solutions containing cytochalasin D, reduced the latter's increase of action potential duration in <b>hypertrophied</b> <b>cells.</b> Whole-cell transient outward K+ current (Ito 1) density was significantly decreased in <b>hypertrophied</b> <b>cells.</b> At a test potential of + 60 mV, the mean Ito 1 density recorded from normal cells was 13. 5 ± 1. 1 pA pF− 1 (n = 18) compared to 4. 17 ± 1. 2 pA pF− 1 for LVH cells (n = 22; P < 0. 05). Phalloidin (20 μM) increased and cytochalasin D (50 μM) decreased whole-cell Ito 1 in <b>hypertrophied</b> <b>cells</b> but had no effect on Ito 1, in normal cells.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of hormonally induced <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> is unknown. Stimulation of cardiac myocytes by alpha 1 -adrenergic agents, phorbol esters, and serum induces {{an increase in}} the cell size of nondividing cardiac myocytes in primary culture. Expression of the c-myc gene, known to be increased in growth factor-induced cell division, was studied in this model of <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy.</b> The alpha-adrenergic agonist norepinephrine (0. 002 - 20 microM) increased levels of c-myc-encoded mRNA to 10 -fold over control levels. This increase was detectable at 30 min, peaked at 2 hr, and returned to baseline by 6 hr after stimulation. The norepinephrine response was abolished by the alpha 1 -antagonist terazosin (2 microM) but was not affected by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (2 microM) and was only slightly (25 %) attenuated by the alpha 2 -adrenergic antagonist yohimbine (2 microM). Serum and the phorbol ester tumor promoter phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate also enhanced c-myc expression in cardiac myocyte cultures. These findings show that the induction of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy is associated with enhanced expression of the c-myc gene and suggest that hormonally induced <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and cell division share common mechanistic pathways...|$|E

It can be concluded that acrylonitrile has a complex effect on prolactin <b>cells.</b> <b>Hypertrophy</b> of Golgi complex and hyperprolactinemia may reflect increased prolactin synthesis and release.

Previous studies have shown that angiotensin II induces cardiac <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy.</b> However, the role of HSP 90 in the angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy is unclear. In this study, we showed that HSP 90 regulated angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy via maintenance of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex stability in cardiac cells. An HSP 90 inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA), significantly suppressed angiotensin II-induced [3 H]leucine incorporation and atrial natriuretic factor expression in cardiac cells. GA also inhibited the NF-κB activation induced by angiotensin II. Importantly, treatment with GA caused a degradation of IKKα/β; on the other hand, a proteasome-specific inhibitor restored the level of IKKα/β. We also found that GA prevented HSP 90 -IKKs complex induced by angiotensin II in cardiac cells. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated knockdown of HSP 90 expression significantly inhibited angiotensin II-induced <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and NF-κB activation.

40|$|Molecular {{mechanisms}} of renal hypertrophy: Role of p 27 Kip 1. There are two fundamentally different growth responses for cells comprising the nephron: hyperplasia or <b>hypertrophy.</b> <b>Cells</b> that {{progress through the}} normal cell cycle double their DNA content and eventually divide during mitosis. Those <b>cells</b> that <b>hypertrophy</b> stop the growth process in the G 1 -phase of the cell cycle; while they increase in size, protein and RNA content, they cannot duplicate their set of chromosomes because they never pass through the S-phase of the <b>cell</b> cycle. <b>Hypertrophy</b> may be an early compensatory mechanism to initially replace the loss of functioning tissue, however, this maladaptive process eventually fosters progressive loss of renal function. Since progression of the cell through the G 1 to S-phases is regulated by cyclins D, E and A, which in turn bind and activate cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), evidence has been accumulating on a particular CDK-inhibitor protein, p 27 Kip 1, which is speculated {{to be a key}} to the complex process of the G 1 /S cell cycle transition.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the mechanism leading to capillary nonperfusion of the retina in a monkey model of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) -induced retinopathy in which capillary closure {{occurs in a}} late stage after VEGF treatment. METHODS: Two monkeys received 4 intravitreous injections of 0. 5 microg of VEGF in one eye and of phosphate-buffered saline in the other eye and were killed at day 9. After perfusion and enucleation, retinal samples were snap frozen for immunohistochemical analysis with the panendothelial cell marker CD 31 or were fixed for morphometric analysis at the light and electron microscopic level. RESULTS: At the light microscopic level, all capillaries in the retina of VEGF-injected eyes displayed hypertrophic walls with narrow lumina. In a quantitative analysis of the deep capillary plexus in the inner nuclear layer, VEGF-injected eyes had a significant 5 - to 7 -fold decrease in total capillary luminal volume. CD 31 staining showed that this decrease was not accompanied by {{a change in the}} number of capillaries. Electron microscopy revealed that the luminal volume of individual capillaries of the inner nuclear layer of VEGF-injected eyes was significantly decreased due to a 2 -fold hypertrophy of the endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Luminal narrowing caused by endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> occurs in the deep retinal capillary plexus in VEGF-induced retinopathy in monkeys. This suggests a causal role of endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> in the pathogenesis of VEGF-induced retinal capillary closure.
