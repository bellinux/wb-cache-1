40|$|Three {{hybrid systems}} were {{compared}} to a solvent-based low-VOC system. The goal {{of the project was}} to determine if the hybrid systems met the requirements of the kitchen cabinet and furniture industries. Adhesion of each system to the substrate was first evaluated, and significant differences were recorded. Subsequently, resistance to heat and moisture was evaluated using hot box and hot and <b>cold</b> <b>check</b> tests. These tests indicated that the experimental systems generally performed relatively well in terms of thermal resistance, but the appearance of those prepared from solvent-borne sealers and lacquers were less stable. The chemical resistance of these systems was also studied. The ability of the finish to withstand the effects of substances typically found in a kitchen was tested, as was their resistance to detergents and water. All the systems performed very well in vertical testing. Volatile organic compound emissions were finally measured after conditioning times of 3 and 21 days. These tests showed that the different systems behaved quite differently. The systems prepared with solvent-borne sealers and lacquers produced a high level of VOCs {{at the beginning of the}} test, with a rapid decrease thereafter, while the opposite was observed in systems based on water-borne sealers and lacquers...|$|R

40|$|The {{threat to}} US Operations in the Middle East has changed {{significantly}} {{since the end}} of the Cold War, and although counterintelligence methodology has changed with it, additional modifications are needed. This thesis demonstrates the gap that has emerged in the ability of counterintelligence forces to counter the threat. Increased military presence in the Middle East and the removal of the <b>Cold</b> War's <b>checks</b> and balances increase the impact of "rogue states" and non-state actors. Current counterintelligence methodology fails to adequately address the non-state-based threat. Revolutionary information technologies and the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons ensure that non- state actors will pose a counterintelligence threat as great, or greater, than the state-based threat. The implication of this is significant. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), the USAF Agency tasked with counterintelligence support, must restructure itself to meet this emerging threat. A Classified annex to this thesis is published under separate cover. This annex outlines current AFOSI methodology and makes policy recommendations to allow AFOSI to better address the non-state-based threat. U. S. Air Force (U. S. A. F.) author...|$|R
40|$|In {{temperate}} climates, most plants flower {{during the}} warmer {{season of the}} year to avoid negative effects of low temperatures on reproduction. Nevertheless, few species bloom in midwinter and early spring despite severe and frequent frosts at that time. This raises the question of adaption of sensible progamic processes such as pollen germination and pollen tube growth to low temperatures. The performance of the male gametophyte of 12 herbaceous lowland species flowering in different seasons was examined in vitro at different test temperatures using an easy to handle testing system. Additionally, the capacity to recover after the exposure to <b>cold</b> was <b>checked.</b> We found a clear relationship between cold tolerance of the activated male gametophyte and the flowering time. In most summer-flowering species, pollen germination stopped between 1 and 5 °C, whereas pollen of winter and early spring flowering species germinated even at temperatures below zero. Furthermore, germinating pollen was exceptionally frost tolerant in cold adapted plants, but suffered irreversible damage already from mild sub-zero temperatures in summer-flowering species. In conclusion, male gametophytes show a high adaptation potential to cold which might exceed that of female tissues. For an overall assessment of temperature limits for sexual reproduction it is therefore important to consider female functions as well...|$|R

40|$|Maize (Zea mays L.) is a {{tropical}} crop with low tolerance to cold conditions {{and has to}} be planted late in temperate areas due to low temperatures. The objective of this research was to identify new cold tolerant populations among the European germplasm useful for improving adaptation to early sowing. For that, the European Union Maize Landraces Core Collection (EUMLCC) was evaluated under cold conditions. After a preliminary screening of 95 populations the 11 populations with best germination and early growth under cold conditions were multiplied and evaluated in a cold chamber and in early field sowings at two locations during 2 years. The cold tolerant populations from the EUMLCC were not significantly different from the <b>cold</b> tolerant <b>checks</b> in the <b>cold</b> chamber. In early field sowing, some EUMLCC populations had similar emergence than the commercial <b>checks</b> and the <b>coldest</b> tolerant hybrids, and higher vigor than all the hybrids and the yield of some of the populations surpassed the yield of the cold tolerant hybrids. Altogether, Aranga 1 emerged as the most promising candidate as base population for improving adaptation to early sowing.

40|$|The {{ignition}} of cryogenic rocket engines is {{a critical}} step towards a reliable functioning of the engine. This process {{is characterized by the}} injector head geometry, the ignition method, the thermodynamical condition of the injected propellants and the sequencing of the propellant injection. This article reports on the advances towards the laser ignition of a cryogenic research reaction control system (RCS) thruster with 5 coaxial injectors. In the last years, laser ignition of a single injector configuration has been investigated with hundreds of ignitions performed for in vacuum injection and the two propellant combinations LOx/CH 4 and LOx/H 2 at the test bench M 3. 1 of the DLR Institute for Space Propulsion [11, 12]. For future applications of laser ignition in upper stage launcher engines or RCS engines, a broader background knowledge of the laser ignition processes of multi-injector configurations is needed but which is not available today. An injector head consisting of five individual but identical coaxial injectors has been designed and qualified for this purpose. In this configuration, one injector is surrounded by four injectors for boundary effect shielding. The combustion chamber used for the single injector configuration tests is foreseen for the upcoming tests and is optically accessible from three sides. Multiple optical diagnostics like high-speed Schlieren, highspeed OH* imaging and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy have been installed at the test bench and can be operated simultaneously. <b>Cold</b> flow <b>checks</b> with LOx and gaseous H 2 have recently been carried out and are presented in this paper. Finally, a brief outlook is given on further laser ignition research activities at the test bench M 3. 1...|$|R

Did I not say well, then, that there was as much meekness and humility under Scoutbush's white cravat as under others? But his little joy is soon dashed; for the black boy announces (seemingly much to his own pleasure) a tall personage, whom, from his dress and his moustachio, Scoutbush takes for a Frenchman, till he hears him called Stangrave. The intruder is introduced to Lord Scoutbush, which ceremony is consummated by a microscopic nod on either side; he then walks straight up to La Cordifiamma; and Scoutbush sees her cheeks flush as he does so.

60|$|It {{was soon}} day {{at that time}} of the year, and as Richard the joiner had kept guard {{the first part of the}} night, so John the soldier {{relieved}} him, and he had the post in the morning, and they began to be acquainted with one another. It seems when they left Islington they intended to have gone north, away to Highgate, but were stopped at Holloway, and there they would not let them pass; so they crossed over the fields and hills to the eastward, and came out at the Boarded River, and so avoiding the towns, they left Hornsey on the left hand and Newington on the right hand, and came into the great road about Stamford Hill on that side, as the three travellers had done on the other side. And now they had thoughts of going over the river in the marshes, and make forwards to Epping Forest, where they hoped they should get leave to rest. It seems they were not poor, at least not so poor as to be in want; at least they had enough to subsist them moderately for two or three months, when, as they said, they were in hopes the <b>cold</b> weather would <b>check</b> the infection, or at least the violence of it would have spent itself, and would abate, if it were only for want of people left alive to be infected.|$|R
60|$|As worms line their burrows {{with their}} castings, {{and as the}} burrows {{penetrate}} {{to a depth of}} 5 or 6, or even more feet, some small amount of the humus-acids will be carried far down, and will there act on the underlying rocks and fragments of rock. Thus the thickness of the soil, if none be removed from the surface, will steadily though slowly tend to increase; but the accumulation will after a time delay the disintegration of the underlying rocks and of the more deeply seated particles. For the humus-acids which are generated chiefly in the upper layer of vegetable mould, are extremely unstable compounds, and are liable to decomposition before they reach any considerable depth. {66} A thick bed of overlying soil will also check the downward extension of great fluctuations of temperature, and in <b>cold</b> countries will <b>check</b> the powerful action of frost. The free access of air will likewise be excluded. From these several causes disintegration would be almost arrested, if the overlying mould were to increase much in thickness, owing to none or little being removed from the surface. {67} In my own immediate neighbourhood we have a curious proof how effectually a few feet of clay checks some change which goes on in flints, lying freely exposed; for the large ones which have lain for some time on the surface of ploughed fields cannot be used for building; they will not cleave properly, and are said by the workmen to be rotten. {68} It is therefore necessary to obtain flints for building purposes from the bed of red clay overlying the chalk (the residue of its dissolution by rain-water) or from the chalk itself.|$|R
