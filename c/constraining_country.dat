40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{review of}} {{systematic}} {{reviews of the}} effectiveness and feasibility of videoconference-based telepsychiatry services for resource constrained environments was conducted. Specifically {{with the aim of}} producing an evidence-based review of the effectiveness and feasibility of videoconference-based telepsychiatry services in resource <b>constrained</b> <b>countries</b> like South Africa. METHODS: Eight key questions on telepsychiatry effectiveness and feasibility were identified and inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed. Review of citations from 2000 - 2011 from CINAHL, Medline, Pubmed, PsycInfo, EBSCOhost, SABINET, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CCTR), Cochrane Controlled Trial Registry (CCTR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), unpublished abstracts through NEXUS and internet search engines (Google/Google scholar) was conducted. RESULTS: Ten systematic reviews were included for review. Despite the methodological limitations and heterogeneity of the systematic reviews, there appears to be good evidence of effectiveness (reliability and improved outcomes) and feasibility (use, satisfaction, acceptability and cost) for videoconference-based telepsychiatry internationally. The application of this evidence in lower middle income countries is dependent on the integration of telepsychiatry into local health system contexts. CONCLUSION: Based on the evidence, resource <b>constrained</b> <b>countries</b> such as South Africa should be encouraged to develop telepsychiatry programs along with rigorous evaluation methods.

Refereed Journal ArticleThe {{general purpose}} of this paper is to {{determine}} the main causes of Third World external public debt, and in particular the role military expenditures have played in contributing to that debt. For purposes of analysis, it was found useful to separate devewping countries into two groups. The first were classified as largely undynamic and resource &onstrained, while the second group were dynamic and less constrained by such factors as domestic savings and foreign exchange. Examining each group separately, it was found that military expenditures have significantly contributed to the external debt position of the <b>constrained</b> group of <b>countries,</b> but not those countries with relatively high foreign exchange earning capacity.

40|$|Lesotho {{and other}} least {{developed}} African countries responded impressively to the preferences they were granted under the African Growth and Opportunities Act with a {{rapid increase in}} their clothing exports to the US. But this performance has not been accompanied {{by some of the}} more dynamic growth benefits that might have been hoped for. In this study we develop the theory and present empirical evidence to demonstrate that these outcomes are the predictable consequences of {{the manner in which the}} specific preferences might be expected to work. The MFA (Multi-fiber Arrangement) quotas on US imports of textiles created a favorable environment for low value-added, fabric-intensive clothing production in countries with unused quotas by inducing <b>constrained</b> <b>countries</b> to move into higher quality products. By allowing the least developed African countries to use third country fabrics in their clothing exports to the US, AGOA provided additional implicit effective subsidies to clothing that were multiples of the US tariffs on clothing imports. Taken together, these policies help account for the program’s success and demonstrate the importance of other rules of origin in preventing poor countries from taking advantage of other preference programs. But the disappointments can also be attributed to the preferences because they discouraged additional value-addition in assembly and stimulated the use of expensive fabrics that were unlikely to be produced locally. When the MFA was removed, <b>constrained</b> <b>countries</b> such as China moved strongly into precisely the markets in which AGOA countries had specialized. Although AGOA helped the least developed countries withstand this shock, they were nonetheless adversely affected. Preference erosion due to MFN reductions in US clothing tariffs could similarly have particularly severe adverse effects on these countries. ...|$|R

This paper describes an economic framework {{to explain the}} pattern of remedies over non-tariff restrictions—particularly domestic subsidies and nonviolation complaints subject to liability rules. The key determinants of the contract form for any individual measure are the expected joint surplus from an agreement and the expected loss to the constrained government.

Up to now, opportunistic MS in some countries such as Brazil and Mexico {{do not have any}} information or databases to understand what has been really going on. Some countries have voiced the intent to launch preventative “screening mammography” programs, but in reality they frequently are referring to “diagnostic mammogram programs”, frequently involving a mammogram either after an opportunistic mammogram has been read as suspicious or after women have experienced symptoms suspicious of breast cancer (National Breast Cancer Foundation 2014).

40|$|Evidence on {{international}} capital ‡ows suggests that {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) is less volatile than other …nancial ‡ows. To explain this …nding, I model international capital ‡ows under the assumptions of imperfect enforcement of …nancial contracts and inalienability of FDI. Imperfect enforcement of contracts leads to endogenous …nancing constraints and the pricing of default risk. Inalienability implies {{that it is not}} as advantageous to expropriate FDI relative to other ‡ows. These features combine to give a risk sharing advantage to FDI over other capital ‡ows. This risk sharing advantage of FDI translates into a lower default premium and lower sensitivity to changes in a country’s …nancing constraint. The model o¤ers the new implication that …nancially <b>constrained</b> <b>countries</b> should borrow relatively more through FDI.

40|$|This Paper {{develops}} a continuous-time two-sector model {{to study the}} economic effects of an import quota {{during the period of}} time over which it is imposed. One of the sectors is protected by a quota, which in our set-up manifests itself as an integral constraint on the flow of imports of the protected commodity. In sharp contrast to the existing literature, our small open economy exhibits distinctly different economic behaviour depending on whether the country is importing the protected good, exporting it or refraining from trade in it. The domestic price of the protected good exceeds the world price in import and no-trade regions, even when the quota is underutilized - in contrast, existing work predicts no economic effects of a quota unless it is binding. Within a general equilibrium world economy consisting of one quota-constrained and one unconstrained country, under logarithmic preferences, the <b>constrained</b> <b>country</b> becomes wealthier {{at the expense of the}} unconstrained.

40|$|AbstractSince {{the seminal}} works of Malthus and Boserup, {{scientists}} have long debated {{the impact of}} population growth and land constraints on the wellbeing of rural people. Today these concerns are particularly relevant to Africa, with its rapid population growth, very small farms, and chronic food insecurity. In this paper we examine adaptation to falling land-labor ratios using a comprehensive theoretical framework in which households faced with binding land constraints can respond in three ways: intensifying agricultural production, diversifying out of agriculture, and reducing fertility rates. Using cross-country data and drawing upon the existing literature, we reach three conclusions. First, population density is associated with reduced fallows and more intensive use of land but not fertilizer use or irrigation, indicating major challenges in achieving sustainable intensification or agricultural productivity growth. Second, {{there is little evidence}} of successful non-farm diversification in response to land pressures in Africa from domestic or international income sources. Third, rural Africans in land <b>constrained</b> <b>countries</b> desire smaller families, but have thus far benefited little from family planning policies.

40|$|The {{current debt}} crisis {{has given rise}} to a debate {{concerning}} deeper fiscal integration in Europe. The view is widespread that moving towards a ‘fiscal union’ would have stabilizing effects in case of macroeconomic shocks. We study the economic effects of introducing two elements of a fiscal union: an EU-wide tax and transfer system and a fiscal equalization mechanism. Using the European tax-benefit calculator EUROMOD, we exploit representative household micro data from 11 eurozone countries to simulate these policy reforms and study their effects on the income distribution and automatic stabilizers. We find that replacing one third of the national tax-benefit systems with a European system would lead to significant redistributive effects both within and across countries. These effects depend on income levels and the structures of existing national systems. The EU system would particularly improve fiscal stabilization in credit <b>constrained</b> <b>countries</b> absorbing 10 – 15 % of a macroeconomic income shock.

40|$|A {{key element}} of {{economic}} governance in the European Union, the Stability and Growth Pact (Pact), underwent a major revision in March 2005. The many critics of this change claim that {{what was once a}} hard law institution for fiscal surveillance has now become so soft as to jeopardize its functioning. This Article examines, first, how exactly the fiscal rules have changed, using a framework which distinguishes hard law from soft law along a continuum in three dimensions of governance: obligation, delegation, and precision. Then it reviews the experience of the first round of surveillance after the revision which so far suggests that the revised Pact is more effectively <b>constraining</b> <b>countries</b> that are officially in “excessive deficit, ” contrary to expectations. Finally, the Article offers an interpretation of why the revised Pact may work more effectively. This interpretation suggests that the weakening of obligation has been compensated by changes in the other two dimensions, delegation and precision, casting a shadow of soft law on the operation of the Excessive Deficit Procedure. The argument is based on a theory of precautionary commitment by democratically elected governments that combine credibility with flexibility. Fiscal governance after the Pact revisions is now arguably better equipped to address major contingencies of fiscal policymaking...|$|R

40|$|In space <b>constrained</b> <b>countries</b> such as Malta it is {{difficult}} to envision large scale PV farms on land due to the high cost and lack of availability of large stretches of suitable land. It is therefore natural to try to venture offshore as has happened elsewhere with wind-farms. Some of the challenges – higher communication costs, corrosive effects of the sea water, long term survivability – are the same. However sea-borne PVs have an edge when it comes to cost as their deployment would be logistically simpler than the massive wind turbines. They would also be less visible from shore and therefore less likely to be opposed on aesthetic grounds. The balance of system costs for an offshore system provides some advantages and some disadvantages when compared to a land-based system however it is believed that the overall cost could be similar to or even lower especially if special panels are developed for offshore use and since no expensive land-leasing would be involved. While most of the systems reviewed are on ponds some of the adopted solutions could also work in open sea and while challenging, other problems such as rough seas and biological fouling should be surmountable.
