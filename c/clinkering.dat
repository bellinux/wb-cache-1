40|$|Hydration of <b>clinker</b> {{particles}} is since long a {{topic of}} interest in both designing and optimizing cement composition and its quantity used in concrete. The interest for carefully observing and also quantifying the type or stage of <b>clinker</b> hydration in hardened cement paste is twofold. Firstly, {{the characteristics of the}} hydration features can give useful information on the actual hydration mechanisms (e. g., diffusion versus dissolution). Secondly, considering the different hydration stages more quantitatively can help to study for example the amount of hydration or hydration rate in different types of concrete. In this paper, it is shown that polarization and fluorescent light microscopy (PFM) and backscattered electron microscopy (BSE) can be used to quantify different <b>clinker</b> hydration types in hardened cement paste. Different stages or types of hydration could be distinguished in the <b>clinker</b> grains: (A) unhydrated <b>clinker</b> core without a visible hydration rim, (B) hydrated <b>clinker</b> ‘imprint’, (C) hydrated <b>clinker</b> core with an unhydrated <b>clinker</b> rim and (D) unhydrated <b>clinker</b> core with a clear hydration rim. These different types of <b>clinker</b> hydration can be quantified using point counting. In fluorescent light, the hydrated <b>clinker</b> zones contain more fluorescent dye compared to the unhydrated <b>clinker</b> parts and also {{to the rest of the}} cement paste. This suggests that the <b>clinker</b> may have partly or fully dissolved, creating porosity and that the hydration products have precipitated further away from the <b>clinker</b> particle, resulting in a less porous hardened cement paste. In other words, dissolution and precipitation processes might play a role in the hydration mechanism. Quantifying these different <b>clinker</b> types could also be useful for estimating for example the amount of hydration that took place, or for quantifying the ‘overcapacity’ of unhydrated <b>clinker.</b> The latter gives interesting information to possibly reduce the amount of <b>clinker</b> and as such lower the CO 2 footprint of concrete...|$|R
40|$|To devise {{low-carbon}} cement <b>clinker</b> product, in-depth {{knowledge about}} the variation mechanism of cement <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions is the prerequisite. The determinants of cement <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions in Chinese cement industry have been inquired by several researches recently. However, the impacts and abatement effect of <b>clinker</b> quality on cement <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions have not been identified yet. In technological sense, there lacks an integrated quantitative model that can elucidate the dynamic mechanism between cement <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions and <b>clinker</b> quality. To fill this gap, this paper devises a CO 2 emission accounting framework integrated with optimization model to explore the dynamic mechanism between cement <b>clinker</b> CO 2 emissions and <b>clinker</b> quality. Based on survey data of 2 typical cement <b>clinker</b> production lines in China, the accounting framework is validated with measured data. Through numerical simulation within this framework, a set of sensitivity analysis is conducted. The results indicate that if the target KH (lime saturation ratio) of both production lines climb from - 5 % to + 5 %, the process CO 2 emission factor will give rise to an increase of about 16. 4 and 14. 8 kg CO 2 /t <b>clinker,</b> respectively. With the same variation, the fuel CO 2 emission factors of two production lines will gain 17. 2 and 13. 7 kg CO 2 /t <b>clinker,</b> respectively. Obviously, controlled decrease of <b>clinker</b> quality can reduce CO 2 emission of <b>clinker</b> manufacturing. The results of sensitivity analysis are robust and highlight the remarkable role of <b>clinker</b> quality in both process and fuel emissions. Besides, the integrated framework can provide in-depth investigation into the dynamic mechanism between CO 2 emissions and the other determinants. Using this framework, cement plants or industry can develop optimal <b>clinker</b> quality standards on a quantitative basis to achieve low-carbon <b>clinker.</b> (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Growing {{environmental}} concerns encourage the cement industry {{to improve its}} environmental performance, which in turn renews the interest in <b>clinker</b> grinding efficiency. Current knowledge on <b>clinker</b> grinding was built over the past decades, but contributions from fracture mechanics remained limited. This research aimed to contribute to this field by investigating industrial <b>clinkers</b> with innovative techniques such as multiscale microscratching and statistical electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA). Microstructure investigations were first performed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and three characteristic length scales were defined for clinkers: the nodules at the macroscale, the <b>clinker</b> matrix and porosity at the intermediate scale, and the <b>clinker</b> phases at the microscale. A statistical EPMA method was developed to allow simultaneous determination of the <b>clinker</b> bulk chemistry, the chemistry of the <b>clinker</b> phases, and their abundance. The microscratch test method was downscaled to measure the fracture properties at each characteristic scale of <b>clinkers.</b> Measurements on single silicate grains provided access to the intrinsic fracture toughness, which was three to four time lower than the macroscale fracture toughness. A combination of microstructure effects and toughening mechanisms (crack deflection, crack tip shielding by microcracks, crack trapping, and crack pinning) explained this behavior. Comparison of industrial <b>clinkers</b> showed that higher macroscale toughness (i. e., poor coarse grindability) was associated with oversized alite crystals, which was explained by the increase of microcracks toughening with larger grain size. In contrast, lower macroscale fracture toughness (i. e., better coarse grindability) was associated with either poorly burned <b>clinkers</b> showing excessive porosity or well burned <b>clinkers</b> having a good repartition of small silicates. However, difficulties in fine grinding were expected for the poorly burned <b>clinkers</b> because of the increased amounts of clustered belite.
