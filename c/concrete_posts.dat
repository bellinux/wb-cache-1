25|$|While {{timber frame}} and {{cladding}} construction is typical {{for the area}} and period, both the hexagonal form and the weatherboard cladding are unique. The tower is surmounted with a red painted lantern room and an hexagonal gallery. Both towers were easily accessible. The newer tower consisted of <b>concrete</b> <b>posts</b> supported by two vertical concrete bars. The old tower is easily accessible {{to the public as}} was the newer one, but entering is not allowed.|$|E
2500|$|The cottages, {{constructed}} in the early 1960s, are raised on <b>concrete</b> <b>posts,</b> and the area beneath is used for utility purposes. Access is through aluminum stairs {{constructed in}} 1987. They have hipped roofs of fibro cement and stainless steel gutters. [...] The cottage formerly housing the assistant keeper now serves as the Low Isles Research Station. It includes a laboratory under the house and can accommodate six people.|$|E

2500|$|The type 26 {{also had}} an {{important}} prefabricated variant, in which the shuttering [...] both inside and out [...] was provided by precast concrete slabs slotted into reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>posts.</b> The shuttering was filled with concrete in situ. This pillbox was {{also known as the}} 'Stent' after the company that produced the prefabricated components, Stent Precast Concrete Limited. On those examples where damage allows inspection of the construction, it seems that the concrete fill was not reinforced.|$|E
2500|$|The Arch {{also became}} one of several U.S. monuments placed under {{restricted}} airspace during 2002 Fourth of July celebrations. In 2003, , , [...] movable Jersey barriers were installed to impede {{terrorist attacks on the}} arch. Later that year, it was announced that these walls were to be replaced by <b>concrete</b> <b>posts</b> encased in metal to be more harmonious with the steel color of the arch. The movable bollards can be manipulated from the park's dispatch center, which has also been upgraded.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was off course and at too low an altitude. This {{was discovered by}} the pilots prior to impact and they attempted to pull the aircraft up, but hit a field with its starboard wing tip and landing gear. It succeeded at ascending slightly, but continued to fly nearly at ground level. Eighty meters (260ft) later it collided with the overhead lines of the West Coast Railway Line, knocking off two <b>concrete</b> <b>posts.</b> It continued for another [...] before hitting ground, at which point it inverted. It slid for another [...] before coming to a halt, [...] from a house. Fire broke out {{in some of the}} wreck parts, although not in the main section of fuselage.|$|E

2500|$|More fortifications were built, {{especially}} in the Intermediate, second and third positions, near the [...] and [...] redoubts. New battery positions were built to accommodate artillery reinforcements, dugouts were deepened and extra exits were added. Engineers sited and designed new trenches and stringently inspected the building work performed by the infantry. In early March 1916 and from [...] the chief engineer of the 2nd Army inspected the first position {{in the area of}} the 26th Reserve Division; only in the area of Reserve IR 119 at Beaumont Hamel and the trenches to the west around Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt, were there enough shell-proof <b>concrete</b> <b>posts.</b> By July 1916, the German front line from Thiepval to St. Pierre Divion was obstructed by sixteen rows of barbed wire and the second line lay behind five rows. Shell-proof dug outs [...] deep, could accommodate all of the trench garrison.|$|E

2500|$|As {{signs of}} an Allied {{offensive}} increased during 1916, {{the lessons of the}} Second Battle of Artois and French attacks in 1915, were incorporated into the defences of the Somme front. Observation posts were built in each defence sector, more barbed wire was laid and more [...] telephone interception stations were installed, {{at the same time that}} more emphasis was laid on German telephone security. In early March and from [...] the chief engineer of the 2nd Army inspected the first position in the area of the 26th Reserve Division; only in the area of RIR 119 at Beaumont-Hamel and the trenches to the west around Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt, were there enough shell-proof <b>concrete</b> <b>posts.</b> German infantry made a great effort to gather intelligence, patrol and raid the British lines to snatch prisoners; the British became more experienced in responding to local attacks and began to use the same tactics. In May, Sodern wrote that at least [...] of artillery ammunition were necessary, to ensure the success of a raid. On the night of [...] a raiding party of RIR 119 failed to get forward, when the German artillery fired short.|$|E
50|$|The {{lighthouse}} has {{focal plane}} of 41 meters, {{in which two}} white flashes every 10 seconds. The building structure has an 8-meter <b>concrete</b> <b>post</b> sitting atop of 1-story concrete keeper's house.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{feasibility}} study was to evaluate the performance of prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>post</b> due to replacing steel material in designing signboard posts for expressway in Malaysia. The scope {{of the study was}} mainly on mild steel with a diameter of 406 mm circular hollow section, which is the biggest size that has been used by PLUS Bhd. Some comparisons were made based on earlier studies in evaluating the performance of both materials in construction and service stages. The performance of both materials in many aspects was investigated; they were safety, strength, workability, durability and serviceability aspects. The prestressed concrete was found has a good potential {{to be used as a}} standard signboard post for expressway in Malaysia in future. It has a good performance and some advantages which are not found in steel posts. By using prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>post,</b> a dependency of the construction industry to steel material supply can be solved and consequently the overall cost of the signboard construction can be reduced...|$|R

2500|$|The new {{lighthouse}} {{was established}} in 1976. It was an unpainted <b>concrete</b> <b>post</b> with a metal gallery, supported by two vertical concrete bars. It was located {{on the site of}} the original lighthouse. In 2009, the lighthouse was disassembled to fit a large prop boat for the filming of the 2010 film [...] in its location. It was recommended for restoration in 2010, with ownership to transfer to Redland City Council as a tourist icon rather than for maritime safety purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{easiest way}} to get to the summit is to drive along the Mt Ainos road from the North West to the {{transmitter}} station. Leave your car here and then continue along the dirt track on foot for about 10 minutes until you reach some steps to the right and a sign post. Go up these steps for another 10 minutes to reach the summit. A <b>concrete</b> <b>post</b> at the summit has a metal container strapped to it, this contains a visitor book.|$|R
25|$|The gatekeeper's Cottage at The Causeway {{was well}} maintained, {{but there was}} no sign of the {{existence}} of the signal box, although a piece of rail was in place as a gate stop and some railway sleepers were being used a gate posts which could possibly have come from the railway. A level crossing gate <b>concrete</b> <b>post</b> survived at Chanter's Lane. A bridge with brick sides and iron girders existed near Kenwith Castle, together with signs of a low embankment and a cutting running through solid rock.|$|R

40|$|During {{last few}} years steel fiber {{reinforced}} concrete {{has been used for}} tunnel linings, industrial floor slabs, piles and the field of its applications is continuously expanding. Commercially produced 0. 6 to 6 cm long, with various types of geometrical and crossection’s forms steel fibers are widely used nowadays as a concrete disperse reinforcement. Although {{there is no question about}} the contribution of fibers to enhance <b>concrete</b> <b>post</b> cracking tensile load bearing capacity, the question of how to reduce experimental results scatter is still very important...|$|R
5000|$|A strand jack (also {{known as}} strandjack) is a jack used to lift very heavy (e.g. {{thousands}} tons or more with multiple jacks) loads for construction and engineering purposes. [...] Strandjacking {{was invented by}} VSL Australia's Patrick Kilkeary & Bruce Ramsay in 1969 for <b>concrete</b> <b>post</b> tensioning systems, and are now used {{all over the world}} for heavy lifting, to erect bridges, offshore structures, refineries, power stations, major buildings and other structures where the use of conventional cranes is either impractical or too expensive.|$|R
25|$|The entire railway {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{comprehensively}} signalled heritage railways. With the exception of the connection at Kidderminster to Network Rail metals (which uses a colour light signal) the whole railway is signalled using GW style lower quadrant signals, of both metal and wooden pole/arm types (Exceptionally, the down starter at Highley has a rare <b>concrete</b> <b>post).</b> Each station (not including halts) has a signal box, with Bewdley having two boxes (North and South), due to the size of the layout there (Bewdley originally being a junction station).|$|R
