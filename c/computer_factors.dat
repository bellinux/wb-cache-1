Although USC, then 11-1, finished ranked #1 in both the AP and Coaches' Polls, with LSU (12-1) ranked #2 and Oklahoma (12-1) #3, Oklahoma surpassed both USC and LSU on several BCS <b>computer</b> <b>factors.</b> Oklahoma's schedule strength was ranked 11th to LSU's 29th and USC's 37th. Oklahoma's schedule rank was 0.44 to LSU's 1.16 and USC's 1.48. As such, despite the timing of Oklahoma's loss affecting the human voters, the computers kept Oklahoma at #1 in the BCS poll. LSU was ranked #2 by the BCS based on its #2 ranking in the AP Poll, Coaches Poll, 6 of 7 computer rankings (with the remaining one ranking them #1), and strength of schedule calculations. USC's #3 BCS ranking resulted from it being ranked #1 the AP and Coaches Poll, but #3 in 5 of 7 computer rankings (with the 2 remaining computer rankings at #1 and #4) and schedule strength, though separated by only 0.16 points.|$|E

Moreover, ‘Human’ factors were also noted to be combined with <b>computer</b> <b>factors,</b> for example that “human made decisions determine decisions regarding the ship. These cannot fully depend on the computer although the computer will provide suggestions and indications regarding which ships have a high or low risk”. Often, ‘Human’ factors {{were said to be}} connected to wider issues such as safety and maintenance management. For example, in a fatality related by one of the port operators when a sailor died after being hit by a thin rope that had snapped in a tug boat fixing operation: “I remember one accident in the tug boat operation. The rope of ship was broken and hit ship control station. The sailor died immediately. There are two types of ropes: rough and thin. The thin rope may be broken if it is not fixed well. This is related to safety and maintenance management”.|$|E

40|$|A {{multizone}} furnace {{was evaluated}} for its potential utilization for process experimentation {{on board the}} Space Shuttle. A temperature gradient can be created {{through the use of}} a series of connected temperature zones and can be translated by the coordinated sequencing of zone temperatures. The Bridgman-Stockbarger thermal configuration for directional solidification was implemented so that neither the sample nor furnace was translated. The thermal behavior of the furnace was measured and characterized. Limitations due to both thermal and electronic (<b>computer)</b> <b>factors</b> are identified. The results indicate that the multizone design is limited to low temperature gradients because of the indirect furnace-to-sample thermal coupling needed to blend the discrete thermal zones. The multizone furnace design inherently consumes more power than a similar (two temperature) conventional Bridgman type directional solidification furnace because every zone must be capable of the high cooling rates needed to produce the maximum desired temperature drop. Typical achievable static temperature gradients for the furnace tested were between 6 and 75 C/in. The maximum gradient velocity was approximately 10 in. /hr. Several aspects of the tested system could be improved, but the dependence of the multizone design on high heat loss will limit Space Shuttle applications in the form tested unless additional power is available. The multizone furnace offers great flexibility but requires a high level of operator understanding for full advantage to be obtained...|$|E

Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 adults with cancer, randomised to receive either a 6 -week intervention (n = 8) or attention control (n = 5) {{as part of a larger}} RCT. Transcripts were coded for themes and subthemes, and recruitment ceased when saturation of themes occurred. Results Adherence overall was high: six participants completed all six modules, three completed five modules, two completed four modules, one completed one module, and one did not access the program. The total numbers of barriers (n = 19) and facilitators (n = 17) identified were equivalent and were categorised into five overarching themes: illness factors, psychological factors, personal factors, intervention factors and <b>computer</b> <b>factors.</b> However, the prevalence with which themes were discussed differed: illness factors (specifically cancer treatment side effects) were the main reported barrier to adherence; intervention factors (email reminders, program satisfaction, ease of use, program content) were the most common facilitators. Conclusion While some factors were cited as both facilitating and barring adherence, and therefore reflective of personal preferences and circumstances, a number of recommendations were derived regarding (i) the best timing for online interventions and (ii) the need for multi-platform programs...|$|E

The objective {{is to determine the}} prevalence of the problematic use of ICT such as Internet, mobile phones and video games, among adolescents enrolled in mandatory Secondary Education (ESO in Spanish) and to examine associated factors. Methods: Cross sectional, multi-centric descriptive study. Population: 5538 students enrolled in years one to four of ESO at 28 schools in the Vallès Occidental region (Barcelona, Spain). Data collection: self-administered socio-demographic and ICT access questionnaire, and validated questionnaires on experiences related {{to the use of the}} Internet, mobile phones and video games (CERI, CERM, CERV). Results: Questionnaires were collected from 5, 538 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 20 (77. 3 % of the total response), 48. 6 % were females. Problematic use of the Internet was observed in 13. 6 % of the surveyed individuals; problematic use of mobile phones in 2. 4 % and problematic use in video games in 6. 2 %.
