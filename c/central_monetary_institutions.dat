40|$|The paper want to {{demonstrate}} how to organise central banking in a monetary union of independent nations, with emphasis {{on the role of}} the central bank as lender of last resort. Section I presents the first proposal for a decentralised central banking system in a monetary union by the Swedish economist Erik Lindahl in 1930, as well as that in 1989 for the Eurosystem, the centrepiece of European Monetary Union (EMU), by Carlo Ciampi, then President of the Banca d 2 ̆ 019 Italia. Both proposals emphasised the necessity of a strong and powerful <b>central</b> <b>monetary</b> authority. Section II demonstrates that EMU lacks a <b>central</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>institution,</b> because the European Central Bank (ECB) is neither a bank of issue nor can it act as a lender of last resort. Section III discusses how to overcome this fundamental deficiency of the Eurosystem, arguing that the missing central fiscal authority in EMU is as much an Achilles heel as the 2 ̆ 01 cnarrow 2 ̆ 01 d ECB...|$|R

The Bank was unable to achieve its goal {{in the first two years}} of operation, as it had not obtained the necessary licenses from the Albanian authorities. The branch office in Scutari was opened only in early 1925. Another topical issue at the time was the creation of the Albanian National Bank as the <b>central</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>institution</b> that would function as a regulator of the entire economic life of Albania. Supported by the Yugoslav state, the Serbo-Albanian Bank planned its transformation into an Albanian central bank, but without success. Namely, it was Italian capital that assumed a leading role in the Albanian National Bank founded in September 1925. In spite of this failure, the branch office of the Serbo-Albanian Bank commenced its operations in Albania. Under its roof, it set up the Privileged Trading Agency, and expressed interest in obtaining exploration and excavation concessions for the copper mine in the region of Puka in northern Albania. It was granted the concession by the Albanian government, but failed to set up a copper exploitation company. Facing numerous difficulties, the major of which was lack of the necessary cash for operation and significant business losses in Albania, the branch office was closed in 1927, pursuant to the decision of the Cetinje headquarters...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the institutional conditions affecting {{the establishment and}} effectiveness of independent central banks and of budgetary institutions. It draws on the recent theory developed by North, Wallis and Weingast on {{the transition from a}} closed and fragile state to an open economic and political environment. The paper presents a composite indicator allowing for the identification of a country’s position along this transition path. The findings suggest that (i) while the establishment of autonomous central banks seems to be relatively independent from the broader institutional framework, sound budgetary institutions tend to be established in countries with higher levels of rule of law for the elites, and (ii) while central bank independence is effective in reducing inflation irrespective of a country’s position along the transition path, budget institutions seem to be most effective as a disciplining device in weak institutional environments.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a theoretical model {{for analysis of}} the imperfect observability of central bank preferences {{by the private sector}} on the decisions taken by the monetary authority, and therefore on the infation rate. It examines in particular the connection which, {{in the presence of a}} time inconsistency problem, arises between the observability of the <b>monetary</b> <b>institution?s</b> goals and its equilibrium strategies. The model yields innovative results from the technical and economic points of view. From the technical point of view, the study of equilibrium strategies in a simple signalling model allows derivation of the equilibrium outcomes of a monetary policy game already examined by D'Amato and Pistoresi (1996) and Sibert (2002), without the restrictions that those authors impose on the basis of the types of <b>monetary</b> <b>institution.</b> It is thus possible to identify the conditions on the model's parameters under which a pure separating equilibrium arises, and the conditions under which there instead exists a hybrid equilibrium in which some types of Central Bankers adopt separating strategies (Vickers 1986; D?Amato and Pistoresi 1996; Sibert 2002) while others adopt pooling strategies similar to those studied by Backus and Driffill (1985).

The OECD Banking Statistics are presented in the following tables (some tables will include missing data) : Classification of bank assets and liabilities This dataset provides the composition of bank assets and liabilities of residents and non-residents denominated in domestic and foreign currencies based on financial statements of banks in each OECD member country and Russia.

Empirical studies for developing countries have not found a relationship between central bank independence, proxied by the "de jure" independence established in the central bank law, and inflation.

Based on this information, it builds a simplified index of central bank independence which, {{in addition to the}} commonly used criteria of political and economic independence, incorporates provisions of central banks’ financial autonomy, accountability, and lender-of-last-resort. The paper finds a moderate negative correlation between increased central bank independence and inflation during 1999 – 2001 in 14 Latin American countries.
