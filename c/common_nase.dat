40|$|Night time {{absorption}} spike events (<b>NASE)</b> are <b>common</b> {{signatures of}} magnetospheric substorms. Their occurrence in the ionosphere {{can be easily}} detected by riometers located at ground based stations. This unique feature is used to achieve a comprehensive study based on 500 NASE occurred during the period 1994 - 2003 in the IRIS (imaging riometer for ionospheric studies) field of view at Kilpisjarvi, Finland centred at 69. 05 Ã‚Â° N, 20. 79 Ã‚Â° E (L-shell 6. 1). NASE generally had similar behaviour which has been mentioned for substorms in the literature. Occurrence of NASE dominates around magnetic local midnight (MLM) with majority {{of events in the}} pre-midnight sector. NASE seem to occur more often during high geomagnetic activity according to Kp index variation. Their occurrence during geomagnetic equinoxes is slightly more than that of s~lstices with the peak in the autumn and minimum in the summer time. They also tend to be solar cycle dependent as their appear 3 ?ces during solar minimum dominate in agreement with occurrence of substorms. Our study confIrms most results of previous NASE studies... North/westward motion of spike events was dominant with speed in a range of few hundreds to few kms per second. Pi 2 pulsations and auroral breakup (found from PIXIE, polar ionospheric X-ray imaging experiment images) are a <b>common</b> feature of <b>NASE.</b> The signifIcant frequency modulation of NASE is in the order of 50 mHz - 200 mHz based on wavelet analysis. Apart from these new findings are also discussed in this thesis: Considering the temporal structure and variation of IT. - index, NASE are categorized into 4 classes. Classifications of spike events allow the identification of phenomena such as pseudobreakups from substorms. Another important finding of this study is the location of mapped points of NASE which is in the range of near Earth magnetotail rather than midtail region in favour of current disruption (CD) substorm model as opposed to near Earth neutral line (NENL) model. This yields using geomagnetic field model T- 96 and NASE of IRIS and SGO (SodankyHi geophysical observatory) riometers where together covers auroral zone latitudes between 62. 42 Ã‚Â° Nand 77. 00 N (L- shell between 3. 8 - 13. 6).

40|$|Element {{concentrations}} in selected fish species from different trophic levels were analyzed. The following fish species were analyzed: <b>common</b> <b>nase</b> (Chondrostoma nasus), roach (Rutilus rutilus), freshwater bream (Abramis brama), barbel (Barbus barbus), Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio),chub (Squalius cephalus), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), wels catfish (Silurus glanis) and northern pike (Esox lucius). Fish {{were collected from}} the Međuvršje Reservoir (West Morava River Basin, western Serbia) during 2012, and samples of liver, muscle and gills were analyzed for As, B, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, and Zn using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The liver and gills had the highest measured element concentrations, with Cu, Zn, Fe and Sr being the most prominent. The bioaccumulation of metals was species-specific, with the accumulation exhibiting the following trends: Prussian carp > northern pike > freshwater bream > European perch > chub > <b>common</b> <b>nase</b> > barbell > roach > wels catfish; Li>Pb>Zn>Cu>Fe>Ba>Mn>Sr>Cr>As>Mo>Ni>B, in all examined species; for Co, Cd and Hg, the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was 0. Results of this study point to the tissue-specific differences in element concentrations, and to distinct differences between fish species regarding the accumulation patterns: <b>common</b> <b>nase,</b> with the highest accumulation observed in the liver, and Prussian carp, with the highest accumulation observed in the gills.

40|$|Rivers {{and their}} {{corridors}} form complex ecosystems that include adjacent land, {{flora and fauna}} and the actual courses of water. Given the ecological criteria for prioritizing the rehabilitation of longitudinal continuity of watercourses recommended by the International Commission for Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) (Appendix 1) and starting from {{the analysis of the}} Management Plan to ensure longitudinal continuity of watercourses in Some?-Tisa River Area (Annex 9. 17. a in BMP – Basin Management Plan) there have been proposed several scenarios in order to facilitate fish species migration above the bottom sill from Apahida. The selected case study is focused on the mentioned discharge or bottom sill in Apahida town (hm 985) located 45 m downstream of the bridge located at the intersection of two streets; this bottom sill is 0. 8 m high and was built in order to correct the slope, to reduce erosion and to enhance water oxygenation. Currently the bottom sill is supervised by Some?-Tisa River Basin Water Administration, Cluj SGA.

40|$|Ichthyological {{monitoring}} and {{the assessment of}} 16 physical and chemical parameters of the water environment were conducted at two localities on the Dyje River, Czech Republic, at different distances downstream from the Znojmo Reservoir (at 12 and 31 [*]km) to reveal habitat alterations. Canonical correspondence analysis confirmed that differences in fish abundance between localities were influenced by different hydrological regimes characterized by discharge and flow velocities and also by water conductivity, which increased with {{the distance from the}} reservoir. The influence of chemical parameters of water related to water quality on fish assemblage structure was insignificant. The second locality (further from the reservoir) was characterised by substantial water shortage during the vegetation season. Changes in hydrological regime and the loss of connectivity in the Dyje River both connected with dam building and water shortage for irrigation have led to dramatic changes in the fish assemblage structure since the 1950 s and the complete loss of <b>common</b> <b>nase...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>nase</b> Chondrostoma nasus (L.) is a {{frequent}} cyprinid fish in the River Danube. In a survey on its infection with myxosporeans, eight different Myxobolus spp. spore types {{were found in the}} gills, swim bladder, fins and intestinal wall. Of these, spore types representing three species were studied in detail by morphological and molecular methods. Based on the differences in 18 S rDNA sequences, two new species of Myxobolus Bütschli, 1882 from the gills and one from the swim bladder are described: M. arrabonensis n. sp., M. szentendrensis n. sp. and M. paksensis n. sp. The new species resembled M. muelleri Bütschli, 1882, M. intimus Zaika, 1965 and M. cycloides Gurley, 1893, all parasitic in leuciscine cyprinids, in spore size and location in the host, but exhibited differences in partial 18 S rDNA sequences as follows: M. arrabonensis - M. muelleri (1. 4 %), M. szentendrensis - M. intimus (2. 8 %), M. paksensis - M. cycloides (2. 4 %). Based on the significant differences in rDNA sequences, the three forms are considered to represent new, hitherto undescribed species in spite of their morphological similarities to some Myxobolus spp. forming spores in identical locations in genetically closely related cyprinids of the subfamily Leuciscinae...|$|E
40|$|The {{study area}} {{is part of}} the Iad River basin, one of the largest basins, a right {{tributary}} of the Crisul Repede River. The Iad River, a tributary of the Crisul Repede River is located in the north-western Romania, and is intensively arranged in the matter of engineering. Throughout its length the Iad River is provided with three dams and reservoirs (Bulz, Munteni and Leşu), which are part of the hydropower developing system on the Crisul Repede River. Bulz Dam (17 m height), which is subject to this paper, is located near the confluence between the Iad River and Crisul Repede River and {{is part of the}} grayling fishing area, where there are three species of protected migratory fish: The Danube gudgeon (Gobio uranoscopus), the barbel (Barbus barbus) and the <b>common</b> <b>nase</b> (Chondrostoma nasus). In order to facilitate the possibility of migration of the above mentioned migratory fish species upstream of Bulz dam, we recommend to perform the execution of a canal for migrating fish, which is fastened to the right abutment of the dam. The achievement of such migration system suggested in this paper will help restoration the longitudinal connectivity of the Iad River on a length of about 5 km, creating optimal conditions for the development of aquatic faun...|$|E
