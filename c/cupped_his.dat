25|$|The match {{had already}} had a moment of {{controversy}} earlier. During the Australian innings, Martin Snedden claimed a low outfield catch off the batting of Greg Chappell when Chappell was on 58. It was ruled not out by the umpires. It was some years before TV replays {{could be used in}} umpiring decisions. Viewers watching replays had divided opinions: some thought it was a clean catch, while others say it passed through the fielder's fingers to touch the grass before coming to rest in his hands. (If modern TV umpiring review had been in use, there was sufficient doubt to rule it not out.) Some commentators believed that Chappell should have taken Snedden's word that the catch was good, as had been a time honoured tradition. Chappell maintained he was not sure about the catch and was within his rights to wait for the umpires to rule. Chappell went on to score 90, before he was caught by Bruce Edgar in similar fashion. This time, Chappell walked after he clearly saw the fielder had <b>cupped</b> <b>his</b> hands under the ball.|$|E
60|$|Rain, beating heavily {{upon his}} body, awakened him and sitting up he <b>cupped</b> <b>his</b> hands {{and caught the}} {{precious}} drops which he transferred to his parched throat. Only a little he got at a time; but that was best. The few mouthfuls of Ska that he had eaten, together with the blood and rain water and the sleep had refreshed him greatly and put new strength into his tired muscles.|$|E
60|$|And Nod {{fell into}} a Munza rage at sight of them. He danced and gibbered, and at last caught up his long water-pole, as if to strike at them; {{but it was too}} heavy for him after his long thirst; he over-balanced, threw out the pole, and fell headlong on to the raft. Thumb muttered in his sleep, wagging his head. And with parched lips, so close to that faint-smelling water, Nod could bear his thirst no longer. He leaned over, <b>cupped</b> <b>his</b> hands, and sucked in one, two, three delicious mouthfuls. Water, cavern, staring Arakkaboans, seemed to float away into the distance, as in a dream. And in a little while, with head lolling at Thumb's feet, he lay faintly snoring beside his brother.|$|E

50|$|It is narrated on the {{authority}} of Humaid that Anas b. Malik {{was asked about the}} earnings of the cupper.

He (the Holy Prophet) talked with the members of his family and they lightened the burden of Kharaj (tax) from him (i.e. they made remission in the charges of their own accord). He (Allah's Messenger) said: The best (treatment) which you take is cupping, or it is the best of your treatments.|$|E

[...] With that, Adams's fears were confirmed, and she became inconsolable. Jack Lemmon, who also attended the Berle party, identified Kovacs's body at the morgue because Adams was too distraught to do so. A newspaper headline: [...] "Kookie Kovacs Kicks the Can." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{day of the}} recording, Cleveland {{experienced}} a severe ice storm which tied traffic up considerably. Cosby delayed {{the opening of the}} act for an hour to give people time to arrive and find their way to their seats. Near the end of that hour, after a period of approximately 10 minutes with no new arrivals, a woman entered and made her way to a seat very near the front row. The auditorium was very quiet and the sharp click-click-click of her high-heeled shoes echoed loudly throughout the room. When she had seated herself, Cosby <b>cupped</b> <b>his</b> hands around the microphone and announced in a deep, stentorian voice, [...] "You're late!" [...] The entire audience erupted in laughter and the show then began.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{rejected}} the emperor's orders and edicts, {{he was still}} conferred the title of [...] "Master Xi Yi" [...] (Master of the Inaudible and Invisible) by the Emperor Taizong of the Song Dynasty. During {{the first year of}} Duangong Period (988), Chen appointed his disciples to cut a stone chamber in the Zhao Chao Valley (later renamed Xi Yi Valley); then Chen Tuan presented a report to the imperial court in which he wrote the following note: [...] "I will die soon. I am about to leave, nowadays I’m transformed in the Zhang Chao Valley at the foot of Lotus Peak on the 27th day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar." [...] By the time he died when he <b>cupped</b> <b>his</b> cheek in his hand his facial features remained unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|But Williamson was not {{the only}} {{innovator}} of his time. A young harmonicist by the name of Marion [...] "Little Walter" [...] Jacobs would completely revolutionize the instrument. He had the idea of playing the harmonica near a microphone (typically a [...] "Bullet" [...] microphone marketed for use by radio taxi dispatchers, giving it a [...] "punchy" [...] mid-range sound that can be heard above radio static, or an electric guitar). He also <b>cupped</b> <b>his</b> hands around the instrument, tightening the air around the harp, giving it a powerful, distorted sound, somewhat reminiscent of a saxophone. This technique, combined with a great virtuosity on the instrument made him arguably the most influential harmonicist in history. He also developed the technique of using his tongue to block a series of holes, so that the notes {{on either side of the}} tongue sound an octave.|$|E

5000|$|Besides the tributes, {{there was}} a Bill King [...] "uncensored" [...] segment which really opened up some eyes as the {{audience}} heard King's off-air banter with his broadcasters, which included some rather colorful language. The best segment was the actual audio call of the [...] "Mother's Day" [...] incident from the Warriors' game at Seattle on December 6, 1968. King was outraged by (ostensibly) poor officiating from official Ed T. Rush in his rookie season. After several calls had gone against the Warriors, King took off his headset, turned off his microphone, <b>cupped</b> <b>his</b> hands and yelled a certain expletive at Rush. Unbeknownst to King, the crowd mic was on and Bill's insult went over the airwaves. The Warriors were assessed a technical foul and owner Franklin Mieuli later had to pay a fine to the Federal Communications Commission for the incident.|$|E
5000|$|Since the 1950s, many blues {{harmonica}} {{players have}} amplified their instrument with microphones and tube amplifiers. One {{of the early}} innovators of this approach was Marion [...] "Little Walter" [...] Jacobs, who played the harmonica near a [...] "Bullet" [...] microphone marketed for use by radio taxi dispatchers. This gave his harmonica tone a [...] "punchy" [...] midrange sound that could be heard above an electric guitar. As well, tube amplifiers produce a natural growling overdrive when cranked at higher volumes, which adds body, fullness and [...] "grit" [...] to the sound. Little Walter also <b>cupped</b> <b>his</b> hands around the instrument, tightening the air around the harp, giving it a powerful, distorted sound, somewhat reminiscent of a saxophone, hence the term [...] "Mississippi saxophone". Some harmonica players in folk use a regular vocal mic, such as a Shure SM 58 for their harmonica, which gives a clean, natural sound.|$|E
50|$|As {{the boys}} grew older, they began {{singing in the}} choir of the Cyrene African Methodist Episcopal Church and in the Park Avenue Baptist Church in Piqua. After their lessons at the Spring Street Grammar School, they would gather {{in front of their}} father's barbershop on Public Square or at the corner of Greene and Main to sing and play the kazoo to passersby. They entered an amateur contest at Piqua's May's Opera House, but while on stage, Harry {{discovered}} he had lost his kazoo. He <b>cupped</b> <b>his</b> hands to his mouth and imitated a trumpet. The success of his imitation led to all the brothers taking on instruments to imitate and created their early signature sound. John Jr. accompanied the four-part harmony first with a ukulele and then a guitar. They practiced imitating orchestras they heard on the radio. John, as the bass, would imitate the tuba. Harry, a baritone, imitated the trumpet, Herbert became the second trumpet and Donald the trombone.|$|E

50|$|A medical corpsman {{examined}} Hatab {{at approximately}} 5pm, and reported to Paulus that options for Hatab's condition included {{that he may}} have suffered a heart attack. However, the medic said Hatab's vital signs were normal and therefore he should be left under observation. (Hatab's autopsy report confirmed he did not suffer a heart attack.) Because the detention facility had no replacement clothing Hatab was left outside naked that evening. At midnight Hatab was found dead. A post-mortem alleged that Hatab had haemorrhaged and suffocated because his hyoid bone had been broken. The hyoid break allegedly occurred when the Marine Paulus had ordered to remove Hatab from the general living area dragged him out. Hatab would not stand so he was hauled by the Marine who <b>cupped</b> <b>his</b> hands under the man's chin, dragging him to the wire enclosure. Once in the enclosure, Hatab was cleaned off, provided food and water and left under direct observation of one of the Marine guards. The entire episode occurred with Major Paulus's commanding officer present.|$|E
5000|$|After {{a walk in}} {{the park}} all POW's {{gathered}} to be counted and be escorted back to the main castle. At this moment all guards, who stood around the park fences, also returned to the park entrance leaving the back fences unguarded. Mairesse Lebrun and Lieutenant Pierre Odry used this opportunity to leave the group, and together they ran to the fence at the backside of the park. Three meters in front of the fence, Odry <b>cupped</b> <b>his</b> hands together in which Mairesse Lebrun set his foot. Odry catapulted Mairesse Lebrun over the fence where he ran away. The German guards were so stunned that they did nothing initially, when they recovered they started shooting without success. Mairesse Lebrun climbed a wall successfully and was out in the open. Still in his sports clothes he hid in a field and via Switzerland reached Vichy France. In December 1941 he went to Spain where he got arrested. He tried to escape again but unfortunately fractured his spine paralysing his legs.|$|E
