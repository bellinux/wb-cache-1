25|$|The {{cottonseed}} {{which remains}} after the cotton is ginned {{is used to}} produce cottonseed oil, which, after refining, can be consumed by humans like any other vegetable oil. The <b>cottonseed</b> <b>meal</b> that is left generally is fed to ruminant livestock; the gossypol remaining in the meal is toxic to monogastric animals. Cottonseed hulls {{can be added to}} dairy cattle rations for roughage. During the American slavery period, cotton root bark was used in folk remedies as an abortifacient, that is, to induce a miscarriage. Gossypol was one of the many substances found {{in all parts of the}} cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous pigment'. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm. Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones.|$|E

40|$|Thirty head of good quality, about 750 -pound, Hereford {{yearling}} steers {{were used}} in the test which was started December 7, 1951. The steers were purchased in the spring of 1951 and had been grazed on bluestem pasture during the summer and fall. They carried a moderate amount of flesh.

All of the pastures in which the steers were wintered had been grazed the previous summer at normal stocking rates, but a plentiful supply of dry grass remained. From 6 to 13 acres of pasture were allowed each steer. The 30 steers were divided into three lots of 10 steers each and received the following supplements in addition to dry bluestem pasture from December 7, 1951, to April 29, 1952.

2500|$|Soybean meal {{is cheap}} and {{plentiful}} in the United States. <b>Cottonseed</b> <b>meal,</b> 1.5 {{million tons of}} which are produced in the U.S. every year, none of which is [...] suitable for humans or any other simple-stomach animals, is even cheaper than soybean meal. Historically, meat and bone meal, blood meal, and meat scraps have almost always commanded a higher price as a feed additive than oilseed meals in the U.S., so not much incentive existed to use animal products to feed ruminants. As a result, the use of animal byproduct feeds was never common, {{as it was in}} Europe. However, U.S. regulations only partially prohibited the use of animal byproducts in feed. In 1997, regulations prohibited the feeding of mammalian byproducts to ruminants such as cattle and goats. However, the byproducts of ruminants can still be legally fed to pets or other livestock, including pigs and poultry. In addition, it is legal for ruminants to be fed byproducts from some of these animals. Because of this, some authors have suggested that under certain conditions, it is still possible for BSE incidence to increase in U.S. cattle. A proposal to end the use of cattle blood, restaurant scraps, and poultry litter (fecal matter, feathers, bedding material) in January 2004 has yet to be implemented.|$|E

In general, these studies showed that total replacement of fish meal leads to the decrease of feed intake, feed efficiency and growth performances. According to Imorou Toko et al. (2008), these results can be generally attributed to the removal of most antinutritional factors by various diets (heating, soaking, enzymes or amino acids supplementation, etc.).|$|R

40|$|The growth {{performance}} of 18 Holstein and 20 Jersey heifer calves fed calf starter <b>meals</b> containing either <b>cottonseed</b> oil-cake <b>meal</b> (CSOCM) or soybean oil-cake meal (SBOCM) was compared. The diets were iso-nutritious {{in terms of}} crude protein and energy, and were fed from two weeks of age until {{two or three months}} of age to Holstein or Jersey calves respectively. Jersey and Holstein calves weighed 21. 4 ± 0. 5 and 35. 9 ± 1. 4 kg respectively {{at the start of the}} experiment. There were no differences between calf starter meals containing CSOCM or SBOCM (p> 0. 05) in respect of feed intake, growth rate or efficiency of feed conversion.

50|$|<b>Cottonseed</b> <b>meal</b> is a {{good source}} of protein. The two types of meal {{extraction}} processes are solvent extraction and mechanical extraction. Most of the meal is extracted mechanically through cottonseed kernels. The flaked cottonseed kernels are put into high pressure through a screw inside a barrel which is constantly revolving. The screw pushes out the oil through the openings made in the barrel. The dry pieces left in the barrel are preserved and ground into meal. During the solvent extraction process, the cottonseed kernels are subjected to fine grinding by pushing them through an expander and then the solvent is used to extract most of the oil. The solvent-extracted meals have a lower fat content of 0.5% than the mechanically extracted meals with a fat content of 2.0%. <b>Cottonseed</b> <b>meal</b> is considered to have more arginine than soybean meal. <b>Cottonseed</b> <b>meal</b> can be used in multiple ways: either alone or by mixing it with other plant and animal protein sources.|$|E

Eighteen 6 month age adult male rabbits were subdivided into 3 equal groups (control, experimental and recovery). The experimental and recovery groups were subjected to 1. 05 mg/day Gossypol suspended in olive oil intubation for 9 weeks and the recovery rabbits were left 9 weeks after last dose. Liver and testis paraffin sections were processed and stained with Hematoxylin and eosin stain for morphological changes. Glycosaminoglycans in the seminiferous tubules were stained by PAS technique.

The study showed that liver was affected by gossypol administration. The changes appeared as distinct pinpoint foci of coagulative necrosis, vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes and dilation of the sinusoids with mild perivascular lymphoid aggregation. The testis showed distortion loss of spermatogenic cells, Sertoli and germ organization under the effect of gossypol. Sertoli cells showed an intracellular vacuolization. Also, there were luminal multinucleated giant cells as well as a prominent DNA fragmentation in the spermatogonia nuclei.
