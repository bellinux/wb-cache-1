25|$|In {{complexation}} reactions, several ligands {{react with}} a metal atom to form a coordination complex. This is achieved by providing lone pairs of the ligand into empty orbitals of the metal atom and forming dipolar bonds. The ligands are Lewis bases, they can be both ions and neutral molecules, such as carbon monoxide, ammonia or water. The number of ligands that react with a <b>central</b> <b>metal</b> atom can be found using the 18-electron rule, saying that the valence shells of a transition metal will collectively accommodate 18 electrons, whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory. Complexation reactions also include ligand exchange, in which one or more ligands are replaced by another, and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the <b>central</b> <b>metal</b> atom.|$|E

2500|$|In Britain in the 1950s {{when the}} baby boom years {{following}} World War II caused an increased requirement for hand-knitting, I.X. Products produced a brightly coloured and marketable plastic row counter with patent number 424432. This was a barrel-shaped counter which sat in stable fashion on the knitting needle by {{the aid of a}} <b>central</b> <b>metal</b> spring. The assemblage consisted of a double rotating inner barrel and an outer fixed and slotted skin which was pinned to the central spring. [...] The two separately rotating halves of the inner barrel were printed with numbers, and the outer slotted skin rotated over the barrels, revealing a single ten and a single unit at one time. Precise engineering ensured that there was just enough ease of movement for the turning of the barrels, but just enough friction to prevent movement of the barrels while vigorous knitting continued. However the introduction in the late 1950s of double knitting yarn and the consequent popular use of thicker needles tended to damage the springs which were intended for needles of a maximum thickness of 3.25mm. [...] This design and most of the barrel-shaped on-needle counters which followed it had a white or cream central barrel and a decoratively coloured outer skin.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the study of}} the effects of CdTe-TGA quantum dots (QDs) on optical limiting ability of different phthalocyanine (Pc) complexes (5 - 12) containing Zn, Ga, In <b>central</b> <b>metals</b> and substituted with benzyloxyphenoxy, phenoxy, tertbutylphenoxy and amino groups in solution and in poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films. The optical limiting parameters of Pcs were higher for tertbutylphenoxy when compared to benzyloxyphenoxy and phenoxy substituents, in DMSO. Non-peripheral substitution decreased the optical limiting parameters. Third-order susceptibility (Im[χ⁽³⁾]/α) values of Pcs in the absence and presence of CdTe QDs were in the 10 ⁻¹² to 10 ⁻¹° esu cm range. Hyperpolarizabilities (γ) ranged from 10 ⁻³¹ to 10 ⁻²⁹ esu L for Pc alone or in mixture with QDs. The effect on the optical limiting abilities of twelve embedded phthalocyanines containing In, Ga, Zn and Al as <b>central</b> <b>metals</b> in polymer thin films was also examined. The effect of forming a covalent link zinc tetraamino phthalocyanine (12) with poly (methyl acrylic acid) (PMAA) and Zn (13) and OHAl (14) octacarboxy phthalocyanines to polyethylenimine (PEI) was also studied. The hyperpolarizability of the twelve phthalocyanines in polymer was found to be in the range of 10 ⁻²⁶ to 10 ⁻²⁴ esu. L. This is significantly higher than the hyperpolarizabilities of these phthalocyanines in solution. Non-linear optical (NLO) parameters were determined for phthalocyanine complexes containing In, Ga and Zn as <b>central</b> <b>metals</b> when embedded in PMMA polymer in the presence of quantum dots (QDs). The QDs mainly employed were CdTe-TGA (TGA = thioglylcolic acid). Triplet lifetimes increased as k (excited state (σex) to ground state (σg) absorption cross section ratio) values decreased with the addition of the CdTe-TGA to the phthalocyanines. The saturation energy density (Fsat) values were smaller in the films when compared to the solutions. Complex 7 tetrasubstituted with tert-butylphenoxy groups at non-peripheral positions was also studied in the presence of CdS-TGA, CdSe-TGA, fullerenes and single walled carbon nanotubes. There is a general improvement in optical limiting ability of Pc complexes in the presence of nanomaterials (NMs). Degradation studies seem to indicate that placing a phthalocyanine within a polymer thin film may protect it slightly from photo- and thermal degradation. 3 (4), 15 (16) -Bis-(4 -tert-butyl-phenoxy) - 10, 22 -diaminohemiporphyrazinato chloroindium hemiporphyrazine was synthesized from 1, 3, 5 -triaminobenzene and 4 -tert-butyl-phenoxyisoindoline.
