Akshaya is a female <b>character</b> <b>with</b> a firm personality, and {{belongs to the}} band although she often acts as an antepole in regard to Costello. In a certain sense she represents the matriarchal form of governance by daring to disagree with the alpha and making her own decisions.|$|E

40|$|This project {{investigates the}} current borders around and within, what I {{have in this}} exegesis termed, "the Down Syndrome novel", using a close reading {{analysis}} of literary texts containing <b>characters</b> <b>with</b> Down syndrome and contextualised by theoretical works drawn from both disability and literary theory. This practice-led thesis introduces and discusses select fictional <b>characters</b> <b>with</b> Down syndrome from numerous genres, revealing them as highly contained, or "boundaried", spoken for, and generally used for narrative conflict rather than included as individuals with agency and a legitimate, autonomous voice and narrative point of view. In reframing the Australian landscape as "disabled" this exegesis illustrates that the Australian Gothic novel can shift, and sometimes even remove, the boundary around <b>characters</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disabilities, allowing a space where the stories of <b>characters</b> <b>with</b> Down syndrome can emerge...|$|R
5|$|Ned Flanders - (Unlockable) Ned Flanders is a weak <b>character</b> <b>with</b> {{very strong}} special attacks. His prayer attack {{is the most}} {{damaging}} in the game as it causes high damage, stuns instantly and hits repeatedly anywhere in the ring. He also fully recovers when pinned, so opponents must beat him twice just to win one singular round.|$|E
5|$|Pepsiman {{is based}} on Pepsi's mascot with the same name, which was created by comic book artist Travis Charest for Pepsi's Japanese branch. The {{character}} was featured in commercials in Japan, and in the Japanese version of the video game Fighting Vipers, and became popular in Japan.

5|$|The {{courtship}} between Ferdinand and Miranda {{is one of}} {{the chief}} beauties of this play. It is the very purity of love.

5|$|The story also explores Balzac's {{conviction}} that a person's {{name is a}} powerful indicator {{of his or her}} destiny, an idea he drew from the work of Laurence Sterne. The title <b>character,</b> <b>with</b> his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself: a visionary genius who fails to achieve his true potential because of less talented individuals with more social power.|$|E

5|$|Tidus was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura with a cheerful appearance, in contrast to previous Final Fantasy protagonists. Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wanted to expand the relationship between player and <b>character</b> <b>with</b> monologues describing the game's setting. Tidus is voiced primarily by Masakazu Morita in Japanese and James Arnold Taylor in English. Both actors enjoyed voicing the character, and Morita also performed his motion capture.|$|E
5|$|Described as a {{large and}} {{physically}} imposing <b>character</b> <b>with</b> a reputation for womanising, Le Gris was a liege man (feudal retainer) of Count Pierre d'Alençon and a favourite at his court, governing a large swathe of his liege lord's territory {{in addition to his}} own ancestral holdings. Le Gris' insistence on defending his case by chivalric trial by combat rather than opting for the safer church trial (to which as a cleric in minor orders he was entitled) attracted widespread support for his cause amongst the French nobility, and controversy continues to this day as to where the real guilt lies in the case.|$|E

Johnson inspired aspects of Ellie's personality, prompting Druckmann to make her more active in fighting hostile enemies. Naughty Dog also redesigned her appearance during the game's development to more closely resemble Johnson. Her appearance has also been compared to that of actress Ellen Page.|$|E
5|$|Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes {{took on a}} more heroic <b>character,</b> <b>with</b> forms {{becoming}} {{larger and}} more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, {{is just one of}} a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain. These variations are considered by art historians to be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.|$|E
