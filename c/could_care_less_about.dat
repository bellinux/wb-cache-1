5000|$|He was {{particularly}} critical of NASA's {{decision to allow}} the shuttle to keep flying despite knowledge of the catastrophic O-ring flaw that ultimately led to the disaster. He likened this situation to an airline allowing a plane to fly despite evidence {{that one of its}} wings was about to fall off. While serving, he befriended fellow panelist Richard Feynman, who later described their partnership in his humorous memoir What Do You Care What Other People Think?. The partnership of Kutyna and Feynman was critical in the discovery and publication of the cause of the Challenger disaster: Kutyna told Feynman about how he was repairing his car and discovered that some seals failed due to low temperatures that morning. That inspired Feynman, who discovered the truth about O-ring weakness: they lack elasticity when it is at or below a temperature of 32 F degrees, such as those the morning of the accident. Feynman knew that some astronaut had given Kutyna the crucial piece of information that led to his O-Ring insight; Kutyna later revealed that it was in fact astronaut Sally Ride, a member of the investigation commission at the time: One day in the investigation Sally Ride and I were walking together. She was on my right side and was looking straight ahead. She opened up her notebook and with her left hand, still looking straight ahead, gave me a piece of paper. Didn't say a single word. I look at the piece of paper. It's a NASA document. It's got two columns on it. The first column is temperature, the second column is resiliency of O-rings as a function of temperature. It shows that they get stiff when it gets cold. Sally and I were really good buddies. She figured she could trust me to give me that piece of paper and not implicate her or the people at NASA who gave it to her, because they could all get fired. I wondered how I could introduce this information Sally had given me. So I had Feynman at my house for dinner. I have a 1973 Opel GT, a really cute car. We went out to the garage, and I'm bragging about the car, but he <b>could</b> <b>care</b> <b>less</b> <b>about</b> cars. I had taken the carburetor out. And Feynman said, [...] "What's this?" [...] And I said, [...] "Oh, just a carburetor. I'm cleaning it." [...] Then I said, [...] "Professor, these carburetors have O-rings in them. And when it gets cold, they leak. Do you suppose that {{has anything to do with}} our situation?" [...] He did not say a word. We finished the night, and the next Tuesday, at the first public meeting, is when he did his O-ring demonstration...I never talked with Sally about it later... I kept it a secret that she had given me that piece of paper until she died 2012.|$|E
30|$|We can {{see from}} the {{definitions}} given by practitioners and academic scholars that purpose often means slightly different things to different companies, {{in the same way that}} people define their individual purposes in slightly different ways. Nonetheless, the common theme is that business should create value for its full set of stakeholders. The consensus among scholars and practitioners is that purpose is not about making money, but about making the world a better place to live. Whenever making money becomes a company’s primary purpose, losing sight of what is the best for customers and the world at large, it is often the beginning of a downward spiral that can be halted only when purpose once again becomes paramount. Volkswagen emissions scandal is a typical case to illustrate the point. The decision to deceive regulators on emissions from diesel cars was clearly good for business in the short term, as it allowed the company to promote and sell its vehicles as “clean alternatives.”. But what allowed that decision to be made? The best guess is that VW was not staffed by evil people who <b>could</b> <b>care</b> <b>less</b> <b>about</b> the environment. Instead there is a very good chance that the focus on clean vehicles at VW was being driven mostly as a strategy rather than as a belief in doing what is right and making the world a better place. The distinction between “doing what is right” and the business case may feel like mere semantics, and there is no doubt that the difference can be subtle. There are the occasional companies like Enron, run by people whose basic ethics turn out to be purely self-oriented, but most of the biggest purpose problems likely come from this focus on purpose as a means rather than an end.|$|E

The classical 12-wind rose was still being taught in the academies well into the 15th century, e.g. in Pierre d'Ailly's Ymago Mundo (using St. Isidore's version). [...] Several scholastically constructed mappa mundi inserted the classical 12-winds. Among these, are the 8th-century Beatus of Liébana mappa mundi, the 10th-century Reichenau T-O map, the 12th-century Henry of Mainz mappa mundi (c.1110), the 13th-century Ebstorf map, and the 14th-century Ranulf Higden world map. [...] Many mariners' portolan charts tipped their hat to classical and clerical authority by inserting indicators of the 12 classical winds on their nautical charts - not, of course, on a compass rose, but rather cartgographers might inscribe the names or initials of the classical winds on small colored disks or coins, scattering them {{along the edges of}} the map, well out of the way.|$|R

50|$|L'impresario is Metastasio's single {{venture in}} this comic genre. Inspired {{possibly}} by Girolamo Gigli's La Dirindina (1715) and certainly by the composer Benedetto Marcello's tirade against the failing standards of operatic art in his Teatro alla Moda (1720), Metastasio takes {{the theme of}} opera performance one step further. In his letters he always complained of the sloppy and unartistic habits of singers, musicians, theatre-impresarios and others involved with opera production. In his intermezzo, Metastasio gives Dorina (representing the art as it should be) most of his biting criticism, while Nibbio gets to utter most of the foolish text (art as it is). Dorina complains about awful 'modern' composers that are only interested in ornamentation; Nibbio utters his belief that texts are not important, because an audience 'has lots to catch up on' during the performance, and <b>could</b> not <b>care</b> <b>less</b> <b>about</b> meaning. Metastasio's text became wildly popular and was also composed by Tomaso Albinoni in 1725, Chiocchetti in 1726, Giuseppe Maria Orlandini, Leonardo Leo in 1741 and Giovanni Battista Martini in 1744.|$|R

5000|$|Socrates then {{proceeds}} {{to explain why}} philosophers seem clumsy and stupid to the common lot of humanity.

In contrast, the philosopher is concerned with things that are, such as beauty and knowledge, which are [...] "truly higher up". It is here that Socrates draws the classic portrait of the absent-minded intellectual who cannot make his bed or cook a meal (175e). Socrates adds a big bifurcation to this speech, saying that there are only two kinds of lives to be lived: a divinely happy one, lived by righteous philosophers or a godless, miserable one, such as most people live (176-177). Socrates admits this was a digression that threatens to drown his original project, which was to define knowledge. Theodorus, the old geometer, tells Socrates that he finds this sort of thing easier to follow than his earlier arguments.|$|R

On her wedding day to Gautam, Poonam realises the true colours of Gautam's family, and breaks her marriage with him. On the same day, she is married to Aakash, the male protagonist of the story, as well as Poonam's wedding planner, who had been secretly in love with her. Poonam's family decides this marriage, as Aakash is a sensible man and after this day no one else would want to marry Poonam. The problem arises, as Aakash marries Poonam with out informing his family, and his family utterly rejects Poonam. However, Poonam is given six months to leave the house, but in that time she wins everybody's heart and becomes an ideal daughter-in-law. Meanwhile, Poonam's parents are left alone to cope with their situation when Aakash sees her concern and decides to bring her parents' home. The problem starts when both parents and the in-laws of the protagonists start staying together. Eventually, Poonam's family too settles down.

Until then the War Ministry required special permission to take [...] "comfort women" [...] without papers, and Tojo was tired of dealing with these requests. At the same time, Tōjo, as the Army Minister, became involved in a clash with the Army chief of staff over whether to continue the battle of Guadalcanal or not. Tōjo sacked the Operations office and his deputy at the general staff, who were opposed to withdrawing, and ordered the abandonment of the island.|$|R
