60|$|Hiram {{motioned for}} me to bear a hand, {{and one by one}} we moved the <b>casks.</b> <b>Setting</b> each down upon the beaten earth which formed the floor so that not the {{slightest}} noise would be made, we cleared all away until what had the appearance of a rubbish hole was brought to view. One might have guessed that this had originally been made as an entrance to the cellar from the outside, and afterward closed up carelessly with rocks and earth, the <b>casks</b> having been <b>set</b> before the place as a screen.|$|R
60|$|And {{when the}} young man asked if the girl was carried off {{straight}} from her home, they answered no, but that a large <b>cask</b> was <b>set</b> in the forest chapel, and into this she was fastened.|$|R
60|$|Noisy, yes; but if {{you wanted}} deep quiet and cool, {{if you wanted to}} step from the glare of a Canadian August to the deep shadow of an enchanted glade,--walk down below into the Rats' Cooler. There you had it; dark old beams (who could believe they were put there a month ago?), great <b>casks</b> <b>set</b> on end with legends such as Amontillado Fino done in gilt on a black ground, tall steins filled with German beer soft as moss, and a German waiter {{noiseless}} as moving foam. He who entered the Rats' Cooler at three of a summer afternoon was buried there for the day. Mr. Golgotha Gingham spent anything from four to seven hours there of every day. In his mind the place had all the quiet charm of an interment, with none of its sorrows.|$|R
50|$|Upon being boarded by a {{party from}} the Cayuga, the Pushmataha {{was found to}} have been {{abandoned}} by its crew, which was rowing ashore in boats. Its crew had opened gunpowder <b>casks</b> and <b>set</b> one on fire. The Cayuga’s crew extinguished the fire and, after being unable to refloat the ship, removed its cargo and destroyed it.|$|R
60|$|During {{all this}} time we had been {{fighting}} in silence, no one venturing to raise his voice; but now when he saw himself helpless and at our mercy Job Lord let out such a yell as might have been heard a full quarter-mile away, while from behind the <b>casks</b> Seth <b>set</b> up a whimpering cry, which was caused by fear rather than any desire to raise an alarm.|$|R
5000|$|Taylor's first {{business}} in California was a bacon and egg {{stand on the}} beach. [...] "Upon arrival Taylor found a wooden cask of eggs floating near the shore. He cooked the eggs, overturned the <b>cask,</b> and <b>set</b> up a food stand on the beach." [...] In 1853, Taylor left for Hawkins Bar, California in Tuolumne County to prospect for gold. He used his profits to buy land in Marin County and enter the paper business.|$|R

These were placed half a mile in front of the men-of-war, and lay in shelter of an immense boom, specially designed to arrest the approach of an enemy at night. In addition to the fire-ships, Cochrane had prepared two or three vessels as what he called explosion-ships. These were intended not so much to damage the enemy as to terrify them, and to prevent their sending boats to divert the course of the fire-ships. A solid foundation of logs had been first laid on the keel, so as to form an extremely solid floor and to give the explosion an upward tendency. On these were placed a large number of empty spirit and water <b>casks</b> <b>set</b> on end. Into these fifteen hundred barrels of powder were emptied; the space around them was filled in with timber and sand, so as to form a solid mass, and over the powder casks were laid several hundred shells and some three thousand hand-grenades.|$|R
5000|$|The Dictionary of Sea Terms, {{found within}} Dana's 1841 {{maritime}} compendium The Seaman's Friend, defines the word cuntline as [...] "the {{space between the}} bilges of two casks, stowed side by side. Where one <b>cask</b> is <b>set</b> upon the cuntline between two others, they are stowed bilge and cuntline." [...] The [...] "bilge" [...] of a barrel or cask is the widest point, so when stored together the two casks would produce a curved V-shaped gap. The glossary of The Ashley Book of Knots by Clifford W. Ashley, first published in 1944, defines cuntlines as [...] "the surface seams between the strands of a rope." [...] Though referring to a different object from Dana's definition, it similarly describes the crease formed by two abutting cylinders.|$|R
30|$|The {{numerical}} calculations for {{the electromagnetic}} field distribution {{of an individual}} Mo nanoscrew were performed using commercial software package (COMSOL Multiphysics v 4.3 b). In a specific calculation, the screw threads were modeled as casks. The nanoscrew was modeled by stacking series of casks along the length direction of a free-standing tapered cylinder. For simplicity, the supporting substrate was not considered in the calculation. The length of the cylinder was 1.3  μm; {{the thickness of the}} casks was 100  nm, and the separation between adjacent <b>casks</b> was <b>set</b> as 2  nm. The dielectric function of Mo was employed according to previous measurements [31]. In the simulation, a p-polarized light with an incidence angle of 45 ° was launched into the box containing the Mo nanoscrew to simulate the interaction between the excitation light and the nanoscrew. The excitation wavelength was 633  nm.|$|R

They said that they had traced {{footprints}} as large as though the bottom of a <b>cask</b> had been <b>set</b> down in the snow leading from where the trampled place was up to the cliffs {{at the head of the}} valley, and all along the track there were huge blood-stains. From this they guessed that the evil spirit which lived there must have killed Glam, but had received so much hurt that it had died, for nothing was ever seen of it after.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Done, sir? Not at all. It is what I anticipated. I knew we {{had nothing}} else to expect in these days, when the Church is infested {{by a set of}} men who are only fit to give out hymns from an empty <b>cask,</b> to tunes <b>set</b> by a {{journeyman}} cobbler. But I was not the less to exert myself in the cause of sound Churchmanship {{for the good of the}} town. Any coward can fight a battle when he's sure of winning; but give me the man who has pluck to fight when he's sure of losing. That's my way, sir; and there are many victories worse than a defeat, as Mr. Tryan shall learn to his cost.' ...|$|R
