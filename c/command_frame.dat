At the beginning of simulation, the command and configuration frames are set, followed by data frames. The file size of data frame to be transferred is selected as 112 bytes as discussed in Sect.  2. Whereas for IEC 61850 - 90 - 5 PMU communication networks, three applications namely MMS request-response, R-GOOSE and R-SV are created in “Application Config” node. The MMS request-response messages are set to be exchanged {{at the start of}} the simulation and its size is set to 215 bytes. The R-GOOSE application is configured with a R-GOOSE message which has “SvEna” value of R-MSCVB control block set to 1, having a size of 142 bytes. The R-SV application is configured with R-SV frames of 305 bytes, as discussed in Sect.  3. The transmission of R-SV messages is terminated at the end of simulation by sending R-GOOSE message with “SVEna” value of R-MSCVB set to 0. By combining different application over a period of time, different profiles are created, using “profile config” node, to set traffic flows between different PMUs and PDCs. Two different profiles, “PMU_to_rPDC” and “rPDC_to_cPDC’ for traffic configurations between PMU to regional PDCs and regional PDCs to central PDCs are created.

30|$|Considering {{the regular}} data flows in AMI, {{they can be}} {{classified}} into two categories. One is the monitoring and controlling frames from or to the sink node, which is the ZigBee coordinator (ZC) in the ZigBee network. The other is the general communication between any other devices except the ZC. For the monitoring and controlling communication, as the ZC {{is the root of}} tree structure, these packets are transmitted along the hierarchical paths, where the depths of nodes are strictly monotonic (increasing for command and decreasing for monitoring frames). The depth is defined as the hop counts in the HRP, and it indicates the topological distance to the ZC. Nevertheless, the parameter that implies the spatial distance is needed to find the best route. In our work, we introduce the physical depth (PD), which is the minimum hop counts to the sink, to indicate the physical distance from a local device to the ZC. Since all the one-hop neighbour node information is required to be stored by each device according to the ZigBee specification, the physical distance can be easily updated by diffusion. On that basis, the transmission of the command and monitoring packets could be optimized by the principle of seeking the receiver with the least physical depth in broadcasting transmission. In this way, the monitoring and <b>command</b> <b>frames</b> can be transmitted in the global shortest path with neither the handshake nor the routing discovery.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The IEEE 802. 15. 4 {{standard}} {{provides a}} framework for low data rate communications systems, typically sensor networks. It has the advantage to fit different applications requirements by adequately setting its parameters. When enabling its beacon mode, the protocol {{makes it possible to}} guarantee Quality of Service (QoS) by using its Guaranteed Time Slot (GTS) mechanism. In particular, a GTS slot can be granted to single network nodes, thus allowing them to access the medium without colliding each other. However, the GTS mechanism suffers from a security weakness. That is, it makes considerably easier for an adversary to perform a selective jamming attack to the network. In this thesis work a countermeasure to selective GTS attack has been implemented. The countermeasure aims at significantly reducing the effectiveness of selective jamming in presence of GTS. First of all, the IEEE 802. 15. 4 security sublayer has been extended to enable MAC <b>command</b> and beacon <b>frames</b> encryption and authentication. Then, secured MAC <b>command</b> and beacon <b>frames,</b> in conjunction with a different GTS management, have been used to solve the security weakness. Secondly, the countermeasure has been tested by means of the implementation of a simple application and in a realistic attack scenario. Finally, we evaluate performance both in the presence and absence of the countermeasure and show the effectiveness of proposed solution...|$|R

30|$|For the DOMOTICA- 3 dataset, we employ {{even more}} {{distinctive}} structures on the semantic representation. The first structure entails the mapping of entire spoken <b>commands</b> to <b>frames</b> without slots or values, {{leading to a}} scenario where the machine learning problem reduces to a multi-class paradigm, that is one class for each possible command. Clearly, such a mapping is unattainable for sets with complex commands as in PATCOR, but for a small set of commands, modelling entire utterances is a viable option. Note that such a structure is less robust to word order variation, and alternative expressions of the same command as utterances are learned in their entirety. We compare a semantic <b>frame</b> structure with <b>commands</b> modelled in their entirety with a compositional approach which parses commands into parts such as objects and actions [18]. This semantic frame structure is shown in Table 1. The values 1 to 6 refer to objects or devices such as kitchen lamp or bathroom door. Once again, we expect improved performance for the multi-layered frame structure since selective rules are used for layers holding only two slots, while multiple alternatives are gathered in levels with exclusive rules.|$|R
