40|$|Abstract. <b>Cyber</b> Mission <b>Resilience</b> (CMR) is a {{significant}} step {{in the evolution of}} IT security. Not only does it reduce the complexity and cost of securing today’s IT systems, it helps prioritize security-related activities. The focus on mission resilience extends the scope of past security practices while simultaneously honing in on mission-critical systems, networks, and processes. This article explores the concepts and some of the challenges related to CMR and suggests areas for future research and study. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cyber</b> Security And <b>Resilience</b> Of Industrial Control Systems And Critical Infrastructures”, {{written by}} Maurizio Martellini, Sandro Bologna and Alessandro Fasani, it’s a natural {{follow-up}} {{of the previous}} paper and describes what Industrial Control Systems are, provides an analysis on what are the main vulnerabilities affecting ICS and describes the principal methodologies for attacking them. Then, the paper defines what measures could be taken {{in order to make}} ICS and Critical Infrastructures resilient.

40|$|Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) {{represent}} {{a large proportion}} of a nation’s business activity. There are studies and reports reporting the threat to business from cyber security issues resulting in computer hacking that achieve system penetration and information compromise. Very few are focussed on SMEs. Even fewer are focussed on directly surveying the actual SMEs themselves and attempts to improve SME outcomes with respect to cyber security. This paper represents research in progress that outlines an approach being undertaken in Western Australia with SMEs in the northwest metropolitan region of Perth, specifically within the large local government catchments of Joondalup and Wanneroo. The high order goal of the project was to assist with measures to improve their <b>cyber</b> security <b>resilience</b> and resistance to threats. This paper documents outcomes of an initial survey of SMEs and its implications for interventions to improve information security and make the businesses less susceptible to computer hacking incidents...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience</b> is an {{evolving}} perspective that is rapidly gaining recognition. The concept essentially brings {{the areas of}} information security, business continuity and (organizational) resilience together.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience</b> helps {{businesses}} to recognise that hackers {{have the advantage}} of innovative tools, element of surprise, target and can be successful in their attempt. This concept helps business to prepare, prevent, response and successfully recover to the intended secure state. This is a cultural shift as the organization sees security as a full time job and embedded security best practices in day-to-day operations. [...] In comparison to cyber security, <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> requires the business to think differently and be more agile on handling attacks.|$|E
50|$|Resilience, {{as defined}} by Presidential Policy Directive PPD-21, {{is the ability to}} prepare for and adapt to {{changing}} conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions. <b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience</b> focuses on the preventative, detective, and reactive controls in an information technology environment to assess gaps and drive enhancements to the overall security posture of the entity. The <b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience</b> Review (CRR) is one framework for the assessment of an entity's resiliency created by the Department of Homeland Security. Another framework created by Symantec is based on 5 pillars: Prepare/Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.|$|E

40|$|Next to sea, land, air and space, ‘cyber space’ {{appears to}} be the fifth {{operational}} domain for the military. This manmade and virtual sphere brings along opportunities and threats. In this book, academics of the Netherlands Defence Academy as well as specialists and military professionals from other institutions analyse developments in cyber security. The authors use various fields of expertise, enabling them to apply a truly multi-disciplinary approach. Cyber threats affect states’ vital interests. By consequence, responses are required that need to come from public authorities as well as organizations on the market and in civil society. Additionally, this is not a national state’s affair; cyber threats are an international concern. This collection of essays questions the premises and scenarios on which policy responses are based. Are these scenarios describing real or imaginary threats? A number of contributions specifically deal with this issue. This volume also covers the process of ‘securitization’, the legal aspects of cyber operations, the use of social media in military operations as well as an economic analysis of the costs of cyber dangers. Furthermore, the authors analyse organisational responses to <b>cyber</b> threats. <b>Resilience</b> is the central term in this respect, both at the individual and the organisational level of military HQs and strategic network management. An analysis based on operations research and game theory illustrates the vulnerabilities of digital networks. No matter how dangerous cyber threats may look at face value, one should not overdramatise the dangers, as the last chapters seem to imply. In all contributions, the authors have attempted to combine academic theory with practical views and suggestions. This makes this book valuable not only for people from academic life, but particularly also for people who struggle with the intricacies and worries of cyber threats in their everyday (professional) life...|$|R
40|$|Our {{society and}} its {{citizens}} depend on the undisturbed functioning of (critical) infrastructures and their services. Crucial processes in most critical infrastructures, and in many other organisations, rely on the correct and undisturbed functioning of Industrial Control Systems (ICS). A failure of ICS may both cause critical services to fail and may result in safety risk to people and or the environment. Therefore, the <b>cyber</b> security and <b>resilience</b> of ICS is of utmost importance to society as a whole, to utilities and other critical infrastructure operators, and to organisations which use ICS. This document first and foremost, provides private and public sector executives with an Executive Summary outlining the ICS risk and challenges. We appeal to the executive leadership of organisations to address the clear and present cyber security danger to their organisations and our societies as a whole. Underpinning the Executive Summary, this document provides governmental policymakers, technical managers, ICS suppliers and others involved in the ICS domain with background and security awareness information about the cyber security challenges for ICS. Moreover, this document provides you with a perspective for action and pointers to relevant resources...|$|R
5000|$|UpGuard Inc. is a <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> startup {{company based}} in Mountain View, California that determines a company's cyber-risk factors by {{scanning}} {{both internal and external}} computer systems. UpGuard’s award-winning <b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience</b> platform automatically scans every server, application, network and mobile devices in IT environments to create a living model of their configuration state. The platform continually assess this system of record for security vulnerabilities, configuration drift and procedural changes, and then dynamically provides a unified cyber security risk score, CSTAR, that determines the cyber risk posture of IT assets against multivariate factors.|$|E

40|$|The {{failure of}} a {{national}} critical infrastructure may seriously impact {{the health and well-being}} of citizens, the economy, the environment, and the functioning of the government. Moreover, critical infrastructures increasingly depend on information and communication technologies (ICT) or, in short, cyber. <b>Cyber</b> security and <b>resilience</b> are therefore seen as increasingly important governance topics and major challenges for today’s societies, as the threat landscape is continuously changing. Sharing cyber security related information between organisations – in a critical sector, cross-sector, nationally and internationally – is widely perceived as an effective measure in support of managing the cyber security challenges of organisations. Information sharing, however, is not an easy topic. It comes with many facets. For example, information sharing spans strategic, tactical, operational and technical levels; spans all phases of the cyber incident response cycle (proactive, pre-emption, prevention, preparation, incident response, recovery, aftercare/ follow up); is highly dynamic; crosses the boundary of public and private domains; and concerns sensitive information which can be potentially harmful for one organisation on the one hand, while being very useful to others. This Good Practice on information sharing discusses many of these facets. Its aim is to assist you as public and private policy-makers, middle management, researchers, and cyber security practitioners, and to steer you away from pitfalls. Reflect on the earlier lessons identified to find your own effective and efficient arrangements for information sharing which fit your specific situation...|$|R

50|$|The {{objective}} of <b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience</b> {{is to maintain}} the entity´s ability to deliver the intended outcome continuously at all times. This means even when regular delivery mechanisms have failed, such as during a crisis and after a security breach. The concept also includes the ability to restore regular delivery mechanisms after such events {{as well as the}} ability to continuously change or modify these delivery mechanisms if needed in the face of new risks. Backups and disaster recovery operations are {{part of the process of}} restoring delivery mechanisms.|$|E
5000|$|Cyber {{security}} {{consists of}} technologies, processes and measures {{that are designed}} to protect systems, networks and data from cyber crimes. Effective cyber security reduces the risk of a cyber attack and protects entities, organisations and individuals from the deliberate exploitation of systems, networks and technologies. <b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience</b> looks at a wider scope where it comprises of cyber security and business resilience. [...] Cyber security is effective without compromising the usability of systems and there is a robust continuity business plan to resume operations, if the cyber attack is successful.|$|E
50|$|The {{final section}} of the EDM Assessment {{consists}} of fifteen questions intended to evaluate the maturity of the basic practices in the assessment. This approach to maturity {{is identical to the}} <b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience</b> Review, and employs maturity indicator levels (MILs) to assess the maturity of the organization’s capability. The MILs are: Planned, Managed, Measured, and Defined. Questions in each MIL level focus on the institutionalization of practice in the organization, and represent a progressively higher level of maturity. Practices that are more institutionalized, or “sticky”, {{are more likely to be}} retained during times of organizational stress or disruption. In addition, they tend to be more repeatable and consistent in practice.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, Johnson {{participated in}} four World Economic Forum Annual Meeting sessions: Manufacturing for Growth - Strategies for Driving Growth and Employment, where {{he led a}} {{discussion}} on advanced manufacturing; <b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience,</b> where he led a Critical Infrastructure Protection group; Hyperconnected World Cross-Industry CEO Session, where {{the need for a}} dynamic resilience of billions of people, process, and things was discussed; Panel Member of the Future of Space session, which extended the 2012 Space Session discussions emphasizing the importance of space for solving many global challenges and the associated global dependence on space-based capabilities. In 2014, Johnson was recognized by the Industrial Research Institute with their Maurice Holland Award for the article [...] "Tools for Managing Early-Stage Business Model Innovation," [...] which he co-authoed with Lockheed's VP of International Engineering and Technology, John D. Evans, and published in Research-Technology Management in late-2013.|$|E
50|$|DHS {{partnered with}} the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University {{to create the}} EDM Assessment. The {{assessment}} itself consists of 71 questions about specific practices. Questions in the EDM Assessment are drawn from the <b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience</b> Review {{as well as the}} CERT Resilience Management Model. In addition, the authors used concepts from the Information Technology Infrastructure Library and National Institute of Standards and Technology materials. Each question in the EDM Assessment is scored in one of three ways, yes, no, or incomplete. A “yes” means that the practice is fully performed as described in the assessment. “No” means that the practice is not performed at all in the organization. An “incomplete” means that the practice is partially performed. For example, if the question asks “Does the organization have a documented procedure for entering into formal agreements with third parties?”, an answer of “incomplete” could mean that the written procedure is incomplete or being written.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience</b> Review (CRR) is an {{assessment}} method {{developed by the}} United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It is a voluntary examination of operational resilience and cyber security practices offered at no cost by DHS to the operators of critical infrastructure and state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. The CRR has a service-oriented approach, meaning {{that one of the}} foundational principles of the CRR is that an organization deploys its assets (people, information, technology, and facilities) to support specific operational missions (or services). The CRR is offered in a facilitated workshop format and as a self-assessment package. The workshop version of the CRR is led by a DHS facilitator at a critical infrastructure facility. The workshop typically takes 6-8 hours to complete and draws on a cross section of personnel from the critical infrastructure organization. All information collected in a facilitated CRR is protected from disclosure by the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. This information cannot be disclosed through a Freedom of Information Act request, used in civil litigation, or be used for regulatory purposes. [...] The CRR Self-Assessment Package [...] allows an organization to conduct {{an assessment}} without the need for direct DHS assistance. It is available for download from the DHS Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community Voluntary Program website. [...] The package includes an automated data answer capture and report generation tool, a facilitation guide, comprehensive explanation of each question, and a crosswalk of CRR practices to the criteria of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. The questions asked in the CRR and the resulting report are the same in both versions of the assessment. DHS partnered with the CERT Division of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University to design and deploy the CRR. The goals and practices found in the assessment are derived from the CERT Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM) Version 1.0. The CRR was introduced in 2009 and received a significant revision in 2014.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> {{has emerged in}} recent years in {{response}} to the recognition that cyber security is more than just risk management. <b>Cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> is the goal of organisations, institutions and governments across the world and yet the emerging literature is somewhat fragmented {{due to the lack of}} a common approach to the subject. This limits the possibility of effective collaboration across public, private and governmental actors in their efforts to build and maintain <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience.</b> In response to this limitation, and to calls for a more strategically focused approach, this paper offers a knowledge-based view of cyber security management that explains how an organisation can build, assess, and maintain <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience...</b>|$|E

40|$|Part 3 : Cloud SecurityInternational audienceToday’s cyber-attacks towards {{enterprise}} networks often undermine {{and even}} fail the mission assurance of victim networks. Mission <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> (or active cyber defense) {{is critical to}} prevent or minimize negative consequences towards missions. Without effective mission impact assessment, mission <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> cannot be really achieved. However, there is an overlooked gap between mission impact assessment and <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> due to the non-mission-centric nature of current research. This gap is even widened {{in the context of}} cloud computing. The gap essentially accounts for the weakest link between missions and attack-resilient systems, and also explains why the existing impact analysis is not really actionable. This paper initiates efforts to bridge this gap, by developing a novel graphical model that interconnects the mission dependency graphs and cloud-level attack graphs. Our case study shows that the new cloud-applicable model is able {{to bridge the gap between}} mission impact assessment and <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience.</b> As a result, it can significantly improve the effectiveness of <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> analysis of mission critical systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes the <b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience</b> Preparedness Index for {{monitoring}} and comparing the <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> of Africa’s top- 12 emerging economies. The index covers five critical areas that incorporate {{a total of}} 24 indicators derived or adapted from the International Telecommunication Union’s 2014 Cyber Wellness Profiles, a Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation white paper on global cyber risk and the well-known Cyber Readiness Index. The final <b>Cyber</b> <b>Resilience</b> Preparedness Index is a simple average of the five area (sub-index) scores; the score for each sub-index is also the simple average of the scores of the composing indicators. This computation assumes that all the sub-indices contribute equally to national <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> preparedness. The results indicate that six countries, namely Sudan, Ghana, Libya, Zimbabwe, Algeria and Angola, are at risk to compromises of their critical systems. In contrast, Egypt tops the chart of six countries, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Tunisia, Morocco and South Africa, that demonstrate preparedness against compromises to their critical systems, industries and classified documents, as well as against industrial espionage. This study also argues that assessments of the progress of Africa’s fastest-growing economies should be conducted periodically using evolving evaluation criteria...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> is characterised by {{an ability}} to {{understand}} and adapt to changing network conditions, including cyber attacks. <b>Cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> may be characterised by an effects-based approach to missions or processes. One of the fundamental preconditions underpinning <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> is an accurate representation of current network and machine states and what missions they are supporting. This research outlines {{the need for an}} ontological network representation, drawing on existing literature and implementations in the domain. This work then introduces an open-source ontological representation for modelling cyber assets for the purposes of Computer Network Defence. This representation encompasses computers, network connectivity, users, software, vulnerabilities and exploits and aims for interoperability with related representations in common use. The utility of this work is highlighted against a functional use-case depicting a realistic operational network and mission. Finally, a future research direction is defined...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Many {{leaders in}} business, {{civil society and}} {{government}} realize that for the world’s economy to fully derive the value inherent in technological innovation, a robust, coordinated system of global <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> is essential to effectively mitigate the risk of cyberattacks. This view is beginning to permeate discussions among senior leaders in {{the private and public}} sectors, and across different industries, as concerns related to <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> shift from awareness to action. The critical questions today are: what needs to be done, and how can it be achieved? Risk and Responsibility in a Hyperconnected World, a joint effort between the World Economic Forum and McKinsey & Company, assesses the necessary action areas, and examines the impact of cyberattacks and response readiness. The report sets these against three alternative scenarios in which economic value from technological innovations is realized or lost depending on models of <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience.</b> It draws on knowledge and opinions derived from a series of interviews, workshops and dialogues with global executives and thought leaders to estimate the potential value to be created through 2020 by technological innovations. It examines the value that could be put at risk if the adoption of such innovations is delayed because more frequent, intense cyberattacks are not met with more robust <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience.</b> Finally, the report draws conclusions from the analysis and research, and offers a 14 -point roadmap for collaboration...|$|E
40|$|Computer systems today {{must meet}} and {{maintain}} service availability, performance, and security requirements. Each of these demands requires redundancy and {{some form of}} isolation. When service requirements are implemented separately, the system architecture cannot easily share common components of redundancy and isolation. We will present these service traits collectively as <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> with a system called Self Cleansing Intrusion Tolerance or SCIT. Further, we will demonstrate that SCIT provides an effective resilient cloud implementation making cost effective utilization of cloud excess capacity and economies of scale.

40|$|Rapid {{development}} of technologies and fast digitalization of all spheres of life around the globe increased the importance of providing cyber security at all levels. For example, in 2016 Ukraine was a target for around 7000 cyber attacks targeted at the state’s critical infrustructure, {{as well as a}} big number of cyber crimes, according to the government. (Poroshenko, 2017). The growing importance of tackling cyber crimes, events of cyber terrorism, cyber espionage and attacks makes countries and organizations develop new approaches to providing security. One of such approach is <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience,</b> which focuses among others on the inclusion of different actors into the process of confronting cyber threats in order to efficiently and quickly tackle and recover from those same cyber threats. This research contributes to the theoretical and conceptual understanding of <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> as a new approach to addressing cyber threats. It also looks at the national strategy in cyber security of Ukraine with the aim to explain the process of its development and change and define the challenges it faces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{cybersecurity}} hazard in a Critical Infrastructure (CI) is {{not only}} about computer malfunction, but is also affecting safety and business continuity of CI. The study on human contribution to <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> is unexplored terrain {{in the field of}} critical infrastructure security. So far <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience</b> has been discussed {{as an extension of the}} IT security research. Although cybersecurity training is a common measure to implement because of its low cost, most of the training courses aim at improving security awareness of employees, in order to prevent the human-error. However, this approach does not address resilience in handling a cyber incident. The authors conducted observations in a full-scale adversarial cyber security training for CI, where participants are divided into an offensive and a defensive team. The latter acts as one organization and its members play assigned roles such as manager, factory operator and IT administrator. From our observations, some tendencies are found in the defensive team's negative social behaviors and the management issues that lead to malfunction of the team. In fact, these behaviors are perceived in every group of participants, regardless of the variation in their experience and in knowledge on the field. In this paper, the findings from the above mentioned observations are presented as possible challenges in real-world cyber incident management...|$|E

40|$|Following {{the success}} of last year’s publication, we are proud to present the second edition of our European Cyber Security Perspectives report. Through this {{collection}} of articles, we aim to share our different perspectives and insights, the latest developments and achievements {{in the field of}} cyber security, cybercrime investigations and <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience.</b> By uniting the expertise of four parties with diverse roles in the cyber security domain, we hope to offer some fresh perspectives on issues and developments that we believe to be relevant for society. Rather than presenting you with bare facts and figures, we describe real-life cases and experiences from our professional practice. Topics include the trends to watch in 2015, responses to high-profile vulnerabilities and advances in the detection and investigation of targeted cyber attacks. Each article in the report can be read independently, allowing you to focus on the topics that interest you most. A central theme in this year’s report is cooperation in cyber security. We strongly believe in the value of uniting cyber security capabilities across public and private organisations and even national borders. In fact, you will see that many of the articles in this publication have been co-authored by specialists from different parties. This reflects the growth in our collaborative projects when addressing the latest cyber security challenges. We aim to foster more of those partnerships in the coming year. We encourage you to build on our work and experiences and hope that this report will inspire further enhancements in cyber security, cybercrime investigations and <b>cyber</b> <b>resilience,</b> both in the Netherlands and abroad...|$|E
