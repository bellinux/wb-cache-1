Particular attention {{was given to the}} ratio of whole closed <b>canned</b> <b>mushrooms</b> to that of whole closed <b>canned</b> <b>mushrooms</b> plus canned stems and pieces - i. e. total yield. Factors considered in the tests included grading prior to processing, blanching and retort losses, shrinkage in size and mushroom whiteness. Cream and off-white strains had the highest level of open and misshapen mushrooms prior to processing and a brown strain the lowest. Blanching losses, which comprised shrinkage and mushrooms that opened during blanching, ranged from 37. 8 % for the cream strain to 22. 7 % for the brown strain. Values for shrinkage during blanching were similar for the 5 strains with a mean of 19. 2 % loss in weight. Shrinkage during retorting ranged from 15. 0 % for the off-white- 2 strain to 11. 4 % for the cream strain. Strains which showed a relatively low level of shrinkage during blanching had a relatively high shrinkage during retorting and combined shrinkage values for blanching and retorting were similar, ranging from 31. 5 to 34. 0 %. The brown strain gave the highest yield of whole closed <b>canned</b> <b>mushrooms</b> at 54. 8 % and the cream strain the lowest at 45. 0 %. Corresponding yields of canned stems and pieces were 16. 0 and 24. 8 % respectively. Total yield values for all strains were similar, ranging from 69. 7 % to 70. 8 %.

40|$|While {{technically}} {{considered as}} fungi, mushrooms are often classified as vegetables {{because they provide}} many of the nutritional attributes of produce as well as meat, beans, and grains. The U. S. is the largest consumer of mushrooms and the share of imports in total consumption of mushrooms has been rising and will likely continue to rise as U. S. consumers increasingly adopt healthier diets. While most of U. S. fresh mushroom imports are from Canada, China, Mexico and South Korea, most of U. S. canned mushroom imports are from China, India, Indonesia, and the Netherlands. The contribution of this thesis is to provide the first-ever estimates of import demand elasticities for fresh and <b>canned</b> <b>mushrooms</b> {{during the period of}} 2002 - 2015 by 1) first using a source-differentiated Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) model and a source-differentiated Rotterdam model; and 2) selecting between the two models based on two specification tests. Several findings and implications are in order. First, demand for Canadian fresh mushrooms is more inelastic than demand for Chinese <b>canned</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> This means that while Canada, the leading exporter of fresh mushrooms, may gain more revenue from rising mushroom prices; China, the leading exporter of <b>canned</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> may lose. Second, the expenditure elasticity of fresh mushroom imports from Canada is inelastic and the expenditure elasticity of canned mushroom imports from China is elastic. This means that Chinese exporters stand to gain more than Canadian exporters from rising U. S. spending on mushrooms. Advisor: Azzeddine Azza...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum {{treating}} freshly harvested mushrooms with a 1 % {{xanthan gum}} solution (XVT) containing 0. 25 % sodium metabisulphite{SMBS) prior to blanching and canning gave a lower shrinkage value than for corresponding samples vacuum treated with water, or those canned by conventional means or the 3 S process. A combination of chill storage (2 - 4 °C) for 1 - 3 days coupled with 1 % XVT was found best and gave even lower total canning losses (chill storage loss+blanch loss+retort loss); these were 6 % {{lower than in}} the 3 S process and 11. 5 % lower than for mushrooms canned by the conventional procedure. These data suggest that xanthan gum has considerable potential for reducing shrinkage in <b>canned</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> The XVT canned samples had an excellent colour and an acceptable texture. Further storage tests over a 9 month period with xanthan treated <b>canned</b> <b>mushrooms</b> showed than an SMBS level of 0. l % in the pre-blanch soak solution maintained an excellent colour in the canned product.
