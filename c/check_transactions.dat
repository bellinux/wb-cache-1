50|$|Many banks {{provide an}} {{exception}} to their normal method of calculating interest, in which no interest is charged on an ending statement balance that is paid by the due date. Banks have various rules. In some cases the account must be paid off for two months in a row to obtain the discount. If the required amount is not paid, then the normal interest rate calculation method is still used. This allows cardholders to use credit cards {{for the convenience of}} the payment method (to have one invoice payable with one check per month rather than many separate cash or <b>check</b> <b>transactions),</b> which allows them to keep money invested at a return until it must be moved to pay the balance, and allows them to keep the float on the money borrowed during each month. The bank, in effect, is marketing the convenience of the payment method (to receive fees and possible new lending income, when the cardholder does not pay), as well as the loans themselves.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in the 1990s, at the {{instruction}} of senior bank management, ING Bank employees in Curaçao began processing payments for ING Bank's Cuban banking operations through its branch in Curaçao on behalf of Cuban customers {{without reference to the}} payments' origin. The practice of removing and omitting such information was used by other branches of ING Bank's Wholesale Banking Division, including in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, in processing US dollar payments and trade finance transactions through the United States. In addition, ING Bank's senior management in France authorised, advised in the creation of, and ultimately provided fraudulent endorsement stamps for use by Cuban financial institutions in processing travelers <b>check</b> <b>transactions,</b> which disguised the involvement of Cuban banks in these transactions when they were processed through the United States. ING Bank's Trade and Commodity Finance business at its Wholesale Banking branch in the Netherlands routed payments made on behalf of US-sanctioned Cuban clients through other corporate clients to obscure the sanctioned clients' identities and its Romanian branch omitted details from a letter of credit involving a US financial institution to finance the exportation of US-origin goods to Iran.|$|E

40|$|We are {{currently}} witnessing a rapid {{transition from a}} paper-based economy to a digital-based one. As this transition progresses, it will become increasingly easier for businesses to capture customer-related information {{and use it to}} support a more sophisticated approach to direct marketing and customer relationship management. However, this transition is not yet complete, as many of the customer transactions are still paper-based. In such an environment, relying on only the digital stream of transactions is bound to result in a skewed understanding of customers. Businesses who seek to gain a true understanding of their customers, must therefore, be able to leverage information through all the channels in which they come into contact with their customers, including paper-based ones. This paper will focus on exploring the importance of analyzing the information content of <b>check</b> <b>transactions</b> as a means for understanding banking customers. <b>Check</b> <b>transactions</b> represent a major information-rich stream of customer data that is available to banks today.

40|$|Banking {{transactions}} using smartphones or {{more commonly}} known as “smartphone banking ” are increasingly becoming popular {{as a way for}} financial transactions given the growing number of smartphone users. The smartphone banking is considered to be different from mobile banking because of the unique and innovative features of smartphones- a combination of a computer and mobile phone that can easily access the Internet. This study based on the Technology Acceptance Model(TAM), examines the factors that influence the intention to use smartphone banking by surveys and analyzing the findings gathered from previous mobile banking related researches. Furthermore, this research identifies the issues of security risk and trust in using smartphone banking in addition to its perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness as key factors suggested under TAM. Statistics on the usage frequency of smartphone banking in Korea shows that the proportion of account transfer transactions are much smaller than the account <b>check</b> <b>transactions,</b> compared with the Internet banking in general. This study explains such less common usage of smartphones for account checking transactions than account transfer transactions, by showing that the key factors (i. e. perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) have greater impact in account check than in account transfer, and trust has greater impact on account transfer transactions than account <b>check</b> <b>transactions</b> in smartphone banking...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} payday lenders, which offer small, short-term consumer loans, and traditional depository institutions using a national survey on the provision and pricing of checking account services. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that payday loan competition leads to higher prices for overdraft credit and bounced <b>check</b> <b>transactions</b> at traditional depositories. In addition, we find that banks and credit unions {{are less likely to}} offer free checking accounts when payday loans are available. We hypothesize that customer sorting and adverse selection are responsible for these effects. Price sensitive, low risk borrowers substitute cheaper payday credit for overdraft credit, leaving depositories with a riskier and less price elastic clientele.

40|$|Being a bank, bunq {{deals with}} {{transaction}} fraud {{on a regular}} basis. All transactions that are handled by bunq are monitored for these cases of fraud by a transaction monitoring system. When this system flags a transaction as being possibly fraudulent, a bunq employee has to manually check this transaction. The problem with the current system is that it proves to be time consuming and labor intensive. This {{is caused by the}} fact that there are a lot of transactions which are falsely flagged as possibly fraudulent, these transactions are called false positives. This resulted in a demand for a system which reduced the number of false positives and thereby the time needed to manually check the flagged transactions. To fulfill this demand, bunq has been working on creating a machine learning model which classifies transactions as fraudulent or legitamte. This machine learning model has shown promising results during test runs on historical data. However, it was not yet production ready, because it was very slow and there existed no connection with the existing bunq back-end. During the project, a new transaction monitoring system was designed and implemented. The new system uses a combination of a bunq-made machine learning model and a set of pre-defined rules to flag a transaction as possibly fraudulent or not. The final system implementation consists out of 5 different components: (1) an incoming transaction system, responsible for noticing new transactions and segregating those over different workers so that they can be classified in parallel, (2) an information gathering system, which efficiently gathers large sets of needed information for the classification, (3) a machine learning model server, which enables fast communication with altering machine learning models, (4) a set of pre-defined rules, which <b>check</b> <b>transactions</b> for indicators of fraud and (5) a Grafana dashboard which monitors the performance and statistics of the machine learning model, the pre-defined rules and our system. The system is fully tested by unit and integration tests. Furthermore, new machine learning models and pre-defined rules can be easily adopted. All the above mentioned components are implemented and fully working. The final implementation is focused on integrating the system in the currently existing bunq back-end, because the system will actually be used in production...|$|E

40|$|The Check Clearing for the 21 st Century Act (the “Check 21 Act”) was {{introduced}} to Congress by the Federal Reserve System, enacted by Congress, signed by the President, and became effective on October 28, 2004. The Check 21 Act reinforces the traditional checking system, while making some modest changes to the methods of check clearing. Mainly, the Check 21 Act introduces {{the concept of the}} “substitute check,” which could make the check clearing process somewhat faster and cheaper, assuming the Act is widely adopted by the U. S. banking system. A substitute check is a digitized image of an original paper check with a similar size and an image of the front and back of the original check. The front of a substitute check states: “This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check. ” The substitute check can be used as proof of payment just like the original check. If a bank elects to operate under the procedures of the Check 21 Act, a customer must accept the new check clearing system; there is no element of customer choice involved. The substitute check will, however, diminish, and in some cases, entirely eliminate, security features, which banks and law enforcement have developed in order to detect fraudulent check activities such as variations in paper quality, original signatures and fingerprints. The Check 21 Act leaves essentially intact the other basic laws governing payment by check - Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as well as Federal Reserve Regulations J and CC (with the exception of some appropriate modifications to Regulation CC). The Act does not have an effect upon the many electronic payment devices in wide use, including credit and debit cards, Automated Clearing House payments and more. Prior to enactment of the Check 21 Act, the legal system allowed banks to agree among themselves and with their customers to vary the check clearing system almost as they wished. Banks did not, however, adopt an electronic approach to the handling of paper checks because of the virtual impossibility of getting sufficient agreement. Around 2000, {{for the first time since}} their use in commerce, the number and volume of <b>check</b> <b>transactions</b> had begun to decline in favor of electronic payment instruments. The Federal Reserve might have used its great prestige and authority to anoint the ongoing process of electronic payments and thereby speed modernization of the payment systems. On the contrary, the Federal Reserve did not take this direction but rather blessed the cumbersome, slow, expensive checking system. The Check 21 Act could have some effect on U. S. payment systems only if it is actually put into broad use by the banks. Although the Act and its substitute check system became effective on October 28, 2004, there is little sign of the system being widely implemented. Little investment has been made in the expensive check image exchange and truncation equipment that will be required to implement the Act. Almost no education has been given by banks to their customer base to apprise them of what may be in store. As result, most bank customers have never heard of the Act or of its substitute checks. Some bankers are not even convinced that the substitute check system will be an improvement on the existing check clearing system and point out the ambiguities and unanswered questions embedded in the Check 21 Act. Ultimately, the Check 21 Act is a step in the wrong direction in the evolution of the U. S. payments system. The Federal Reserve should have allowed the antiquated checking system to continue to phase out of use. Additionally, the Fed should concentrate on developing an innovative electronic payments system and facilitate its use by consumers and businesses...|$|E

However unlike the use of credit and debit cards, current technology does not allow paper checks to be automatically processed because the amount to be paid is usually handwritten. In answer to this issue, PROFIT (Productivity from Information Technology) of MIT Sloan School of Management, headed by Professor Amar Gupta, has developed a system to automate the reading of checks. This automation would eliminate both the time needed for an individual to manually enter the <b>check</b> <b>transaction,</b> as well as the time for a second individual to verify that data entry. The successful implementation of such a system would have a great impact on the banking industry, as it would make check processing more efficient and also reduce the number of human errors.

40|$|Data {{corruption}} {{is the most}} common consequence of file-system bugs, as shown by a recent study. When such cor-ruption occurs, the file system’s offline check and recov-ery tools need to be used, but they are error prone and cause significant downtime. Previous work has shown that a runtime checker for the Ext 3 journaling file system can verify that metadata updates within a transaction are mutually consistent, helping detect corruption in meta-data blocks at commit time. However, corruption can still be caused when a bug in the file system’s transac-tional mechanism loses, misdirects, or corrupts writes. We show that a runtime checker needs to enforce the atomicity and durability properties of the file system on every write, in addition to <b>checking</b> <b>transactions</b> at com-mit time, to provide the strong guarantee that every block write will maintain file system consistency. In this paper, we identify the invariants that need to be enforced on journaling and shadow paging file systems to preserve the integrity of committed transactions. We also describe the key properties that make it feasible to check these invariants for a file system. Based on this characterization, we have implemented runtime check-ers for {{a modified version of the}} Ext 3 file system and for the Btrfs file system. Our evaluation shows that both checkers detect data corruption effectively, and they can be used during normal operation with low overhead. ...|$|R
