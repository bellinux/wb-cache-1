5|$|Sebaceous carcinoma, an {{uncommon}} and aggressive <b>cutaneous</b> tumour.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid nodules {{have been}} {{associated}} with the Birt–Hogg–Dubé phenotype, present in 65% of individuals and 90% of families with the syndrome. However, a connection between BHD and thyroid cancer has not been substantiated. Other conditions have been reported to be associated but may not be caused by the mutation in FLCN or may not be related at all. These include multinodular goiter, medullary thyroid carcinoma, parotid oncocytoma, colonic polyposis, connective tissue nevus, lipomas, angiolipomas, parathyroid adenomas, flecked chorioretinopathy, neurothekeoma, meningiomas, angiofibromas of the face, trichoblastomas, <b>cutaneous</b> focal mucinosis, <b>cutaneous</b> leiomyoma, breast cancer, tonsillar cancer, colorectal cancer, sarcoma of the leg, lung cancer, melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, basal cell carcinoma, <b>cutaneous</b> leiomyosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Vascular-related <b>cutaneous</b> {{conditions}} {{result from}} dysfunction {{of the blood}} or {{blood vessels in the}} dermis, or lymphatics in the subcutaneous tissues.|$|E
5|$|Virus-related <b>cutaneous</b> {{conditions}} {{are caused by}} two main groups of viruses–DNA and RNA types–both of which are obligatory intracellular parasites.|$|E
5|$|Eosinophilic <b>cutaneous</b> {{conditions}} encompass a {{wide variety}} of diseases that are characterized histologically by the presence of eosinophils in the inflammatory infiltrate, or evidence of eosinophil degranulation.|$|E
5|$|Monocyte- and macrophage-related <b>cutaneous</b> {{conditions}} are characterized histologically by infiltration {{of the skin}} by monocyte or macrophage cells, often divided into several categories, including granulomatous disease, histiocytoses, and sarcoidosis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cutaneous</b> {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé were {{originally}} described as fibrofolliculomas (abnormal growths of a hair follicle), trichodiscomas (hamartomatous lesions with a hair follicle at the periphery, often {{found on the}} face), and acrochordons (skin tags). <b>Cutaneous</b> manifestations are confirmed by histology. Most individuals (89%) with BHD are found to have multiple cysts in both lungs, and 24% have had one or more episodes of pneumothorax. The cysts can be detected by chest CT scan. Renal tumors can manifest as multiple types of renal cell carcinoma, but certain pathological subtypes (including chromophobe, oncocytoma, and oncocytic hybrid tumors) are more commonly seen. Although the original syndrome was discovered {{on the basis of}} <b>cutaneous</b> findings, it is now recognized that individuals with Birt–Hogg–Dubé may only manifest the pulmonary and/or renal findings, without any skin lesions. Though these signs indicate BHD, it is only confirmed with a genetic test for FLCN mutations.|$|E
5|$|The lungs in {{amphibians}} are primitive {{compared to}} those of amniotes, possessing few internal septa and large alveoli, and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood. Ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping. Most amphibians, however, are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin. To enable sufficient <b>cutaneous</b> respiration, the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate. Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on <b>cutaneous</b> respiration, as in the Titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on <b>cutaneous</b> gas exchange, most famously the plethodontid salamanders, which have neither lungs nor gills. Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the axolotl) retaining gills as aquatic adults.|$|E
5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé can be {{difficult}} to diagnose from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and <b>cutaneous</b> tumors occur with other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors similar to those seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with examination of the tumors' histology.|$|E
5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of psoriasis includes dermatological conditions similar in appearance such as discoid eczema, seborrhoeic eczema, pityriasis rosea (may {{be confused with}} guttate psoriasis), nail fungus (may be confused with nail psoriasis) or <b>cutaneous</b> T cell lymphoma (50% of individuals with this cancer are initially misdiagnosed with psoriasis). Dermatologic manifestations of systemic illnesses such as the rash of secondary syphilis may also be confused with psoriasis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cutaneous</b> {{innervation}} {{refers to}} the area of the skin which is supplied by a specific <b>cutaneous</b> nerve.|$|E
25|$|As many as 70% {{of people}} with lupus have some skin symptoms. The three main {{categories}} of lesions are chronic <b>cutaneous</b> (discoid) lupus, subacute <b>cutaneous</b> lupus, and acute <b>cutaneous</b> lupus. People with discoid lupus may exhibit thick, red scaly patches on the skin. Similarly, subacute <b>cutaneous</b> lupus manifests as red, scaly patches of skin but with distinct edges. Acute <b>cutaneous</b> lupus manifests as a rash. Some have the classic malar rash (or butterfly rash) associated with the disease. This rash occurs in 30 to 60% {{of people with}} SLE.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cutaneous</b> {{leishmaniasis}} is endemic in all tropical and subtropical {{areas of}} the world. The distribution of this disease is very tightly linked to geography, and villages even 15miles apart can have very different rates of <b>cutaneous</b> leishmaniasis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cutaneous,</b> as perspiration, or itchy skin.|$|E
25|$|Barotrauma: ENT; dental; <b>cutaneous,</b> conjunctival, etc.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cutaneous</b> {{leishmaniasis}} is {{the most}} common form, which causes an open sore at the bite sites, which heals in a few months to a year and half, leaving an unpleasant-looking scar. Diffuse <b>cutaneous</b> leishmaniasis produces widespread skin lesions which resemble leprosy, and may not heal on its own.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin {{can be used}} {{to treat}} <b>cutaneous</b> lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) works with the {{peripheral}} nervous system in <b>cutaneous</b> innervation. The CNS is responsible for processing the information it receives from the <b>cutaneous</b> nerves that detect a given stimulus, and then identifying the kind of sensory inputs which project to a specific region of the primary somatosensory cortex.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cutaneous</b> {{forms are}} those {{affecting}} the skin, scalp, and nails.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cutaneous</b> lesions {{can become}} superinfected with bacteria, {{resulting}} in cellulitis.|$|E
