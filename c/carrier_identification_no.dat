40|$|Haemoglobinopathies {{constitute}} the commonest recessive monogenic disorders worldwide, {{and the treatment}} of affected individuals presents a substantial global disease burden. <b>Carrier</b> <b>identification</b> and prenatal diagnosis represent valuable procedures that identify couples at risk for having affected children, {{so that they can}} be offered options to have healthy offspring. Molecular diagnosis facilitates prenatal diagnosis and definitive diagnosis of carriers and patients (especially ‘atypical’ cases who often have complex genotype interactions). However, the haemoglobin disorders are unique among all genetic diseases in that <b>identification</b> of <b>carriers</b> is preferable by haematological (biochemical) tests rather than DNA analysis. These Best Practice guidelines offer an overview of recommended strategies and methods for <b>carrier</b> <b>identification</b> and prenatal diagnosis of haemoglobinopathies, and emphasize the importance of appropriately applying and interpreting haematological tests in supporting the optimum application and evaluation of globin gene DNA analysis...|$|R

We show that if the sole effect of introducing MNP is the abolishment of switching costs, MNP unambiguously benefits mobile customers. However, if MNP also causes consumer ignorance, as telephone numbers no longer identify networks, mobile operators will increase termination charges, with ambiguous net effect on the surplus of mobile customers. We examine how extensions such as MNP based on call-forwarding, termination fee regulation, and alternative means of <b>carrier</b> <b>identification</b> affect these findings and discuss policy implications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a dominant}} genetic disorder of the myocardium associated with dysfunctional contractile proteins. The major risk of HCM is sudden cardiac death, which may occur even in asymptomatic carriers. Causes are highly heterogeneous. Over 140 different mutations in nine sarcomeric genes {{have been described}} to date. The majority of cases (80 % or more) may eventually be traced {{to one of these}} genes. Although genetic counselling is suggested even if mutations are not known, molecular diagnosis implies new options such as <b>carrier</b> <b>identification</b> or - theoretically - preclinical risk stratification.

The mutations include DNA base substitutions, small DNA deletions, a single DNA base insertion, and errors in RNA splicing.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the psychosocial implications for families whose infant {{was identified as}} a cystic fibrosis carrier by newborn screening. DESIGN: Prospective psychosocial assessment. SETTING: Primary care. RESPONDENTS: Study: (a) families of an affected infant identified by screening (n = 9); (b) families of a carrier infant identified by screening (n = 10). Control: group of mothers from the general population (n = 82). INTERVENTIONS: Questionnaires and semistructured interviews. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attitude to screening, assessments of the mother/baby relationship, anxiety, wellbeing. RESULTS: All families were in favour of screening, with no evidence that the mother/baby relationship, anxiety or wellbeing had been adversely affected. Parents, however, did identify problems in terms of the service delivery protocol and genetic counselling practice.

40|$|Recently, {{a pair of}} PCR primers {{have been}} {{described}} that {{make it possible to}} amplify a highly polymorphic VNTR locus DX 552 (St 14). PCR products range in size from approximately 650 to 3000 bp. Ninety X chromosomes from unrelated Caucasian subjects were investigated. Digestion of the PCR products with TaQI revealed the presence of a polymorphic TaQI restriction site within the product 200 bp from the end. This restriction site is present on 60 % and absent on 40 % of all alleles, but the absence is confined solely to the alleles 1690 bp (39 %) and 2100 bp (1 %). Thus, there is a strong allelic association between the most frequent 1690 bp allele and the absence of the TaQI restriction site. Determination of this polymorphisms within the St 14 VNTR region increases the expected heterozygosity at the DXS 52 locus from 72 % to 80 %.

40|$|Background: β -Thalassaemia, an {{autosomal}} recessive hemoglobinopathy, {{is one of}} the commonest genetically transmitted disorders throughout the world. Collective measures including <b>carrier</b> <b>identification,</b> genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis are required for preventing β-thalassemia. Aim: To achieve this objective, Identification of the spectrum of genetic mutations, especially for various ethnic backgrounds in Pakistan. Therefore, we designed a cross sectional prospective study to identify the frequency of various gene mutations in different ethnic groups of Pakistan. Materials and Methods: Over a 5 -year period, DNA from 648 blood samples {including specimens of chorionic villus sampling (CVS) } were analyzed for the twelve most common β-thalassemia mutations found in the Pakistani population by a Multiplex amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). Each sample was analyzed for the mutation as well as the normal gene, appropriate with negative and positive controls, and reagent blanks. Results: Out of 648 samples mutations were identified in 640 (98. 75 %) samples by multiplex ARMS. 8 common β-thalassemia mutations were identified in 8 different ethnic groups accounting for 93. 9 % of the β-thalasemia alleles.

40|$|The mucopolysaccharidoses are {{a family}} of genetic {{diseases}} involving faulty degradation {{of one or more}} type of mucopolysaccharide or glycosaminoglycan. These conditions are characterized by skeletal, connective tissue, and intellectual manifestations. Biochemical investigations over the past 10 – 20 yr have enhanced our understanding of the clinical conditions and advanced our knowledge of catabolic pathways for complex biological structures. Identification of stored and excreted materials as partially degraded glycosaminoglycans allowed classification of these conditions on clinical and chemical criteria. The development of a cell culture model for studying the mucopolysaccharidoses lead to the identification of a variety of lysosomal sulfatases and glycosidases as deficient enzymes. This stimulated the identification of several new conditions. Knowledge of primary biochemical defects improved genetic services by providing accurate diagnosis, facilitating <b>carrier</b> <b>identification</b> and improving prenatal diagnosis. Glycosaminoglycan excretion patterns associated with individual enzyme defects suggested sequential degradative pathways for GAGs and related macromolecules.
