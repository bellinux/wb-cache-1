40|$|Spider silk {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} for its attractive mechanical properties and potential applications in medicine and industry. The production of spider silk, however, has been lagging behind for lack of suitable systems. Our approach focuses on solving the production of spider silk by designing, expressing, purifying and characterizing the silk from <b>cylindriform</b> glands. We show that the <b>cylindriform</b> silk protein, {{in contrast to the}} commonly used dragline silk protein, is fully folded and stable in solution. With the help of GFP as a fusion tag we enhanced the expression of the silk protein in Escherichia coli and could optimize the downstream processing. Secondary structures analysis by circular dichroism and FTIR shows that the GFP-Silk fusion protein is predominantly α-helical, and that pH can trigger a α- to β-transition resulting in aggregation. Structural analysis by small angle x-ray scattering suggests that the GFP-Silk exists {{in the form of a}} hexamer in solution...|$|E

40|$|Suitably shaped (tall, {{slim and}} {{more or less}} <b>cylindriform),</b> vulnerable, intact stalagmites (STM) in Domica cave have been examined. Some of these STMs are {{suitable}} to estimate the upper limit for horizontal peak ground acceleration generated by paleoearthquake. This research is the continuation of our previous examination of STMs in Baradla cave, north - east Hungary. The density, the Young’s modulus and the tensile failure stress of broken STM samples have been measured in mechanical laboratory, whereas the natural frequency and the heights and diameters of intact STMs were determined by in situ observation. The value of horizontal ground acceleration resulting in failure and the theoretical natural frequency of STM were assessed by theoretical calculations. The age of the samples taken from the STM(2. 26 m) standing in show part of Domica cave has been determined by Multi Collector – Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry analysis (MC-ICPMS). The a g value (the upper limit for horizontal peak ground acceleration) need ed to break STM(5 m) in Čertova diera (Ördög-lik) hall coming from theoretical calculation is almost the same (0. 059 g) as - in case of STM(5. 1 m) in Olimposz hall (0. 055 g) of Baradla cave. According to our measurements and theoretical calculations, in the last 2 - 5 kyears the geological structures close to Baradla and Domica caves have not generated paleoearthquakes, which would have produced horizontal ground acceleration larger than 0. 061 g. This value can be reached even in moderate size earthquakes. Our result {{has to be taken}} into account when calculating the seismic potential of faults near to Domica cave (e. g. Darnó,Plešivec (Pelsőc) and Rožňava (Rozsnyó) lines. ...|$|E
40|$|The silk fibres spun by {{insects and}} spiders have {{intrigued}} scientists for many years. Their mechanical performance is remarkable {{when one considers}} that the fibres are spun under ambient conditions from aqueous protein solutions without requiring many of the harsh processing conditions used in the production of man-made fibres. Yet, despite this interest, very {{little is known about the}} initial structure of the precursor proteins prior to spinning. One reason for this lies in the difficulty of handling the native proteins without accidental aggregation. Therefore in this thesis a novel sample preparation protocol for native silk is developed and small angle scattering (SAS) techniques are combined with circular dichroism (CD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine the structure and morphology of the proteins with different mechanical properties and thus biological function in nature. This work highlights the importance of studying native, functional proteins, at close to in vivo conditions, since clear differences in the structure and interaction of native and reconstituted silks can be attributed to the additional processing which reconstituted silks have undergone in order to be solubilised. Indeed native silk proteins are found to be more inherently non-interacting at quite high protein concentrations than reconstituted silk. Upon dilution, inter-chain interactions can be observed by SAS and CD as the protein is driven from its equilibrium conformation. This interaction and the shear-induced assembly of these proteins are also followed by AFM. Interestingly, native silk proteins from spider and silkworms retain a semiflexible conformation in solution. Indeed by comparing the silks from the major and minor ampullate, flagelliform and <b>cylindriform</b> glands of Nephila edulis with the cocoon silk of Bombyx mori silkworms, important insights are gained into how their flexibility suggests similarities in the local environment of the protein chains thereby dictating the hierarchical structure of silk fibres.

40|$|Spider {{dragline}} silk possesses several desirable {{features of}} a biomaterial; it has extraordinary mechanical properties, is biocompatible and biodegradable. It consists of large proteins, major ampullate spidroins (MaSp:s), that contain alternating polyalanine- and glycine-rich blocks between non-repetitive C- and N-terminal domains. No full length MaSp gene has been cloned, hence the knowledge of their constitution is limited. The spider stores the silk in a liquid form, which is converted into a fibre by a poorly understood mechanism. Even truncated spidroins are difficult to produce recombinantly in soluble form. Most previous attempts to produce artificial spider silk fibres have included solubilization steps in non-physiological solvents {{and the use of}} spinning devises for fibre formation. This thesis presents a novel method for production of macroscopic fibres under physiological conditions, without using denaturing agents. A miniature spidroin is identified that can be produced recombinantly in E. coli when fused to a soluble fusion tag. Upon enzymatic release of the fusion tag, the miniature spidroins spontaneously form macroscopic fibres in physiological solution. These fibres resemble native silk and their strength equals that of fibres spun from regenerated silk. Initial studies suggest that the fibres are biocompatible. This represents a major breakthrough for future biomaterial development. Molecular studies of cDNA and genetic sequences encoding the dragline silk revealed an unexpectedly high level of heterogeneity and the presence of at least two MaSp 1 genes. Furthermore, the E. australis MaSp 2 was characterised for the first time, as well as a new MaSp-like spidroin. Sequence analysis of previously published spidroin N-terminal domains compared with that of E. australis MaSp 1, enabled identification of signal peptides and a ∼ 130 residue non-repetitive domain common to dragline, flagelliform and <b>cylindriform</b> spidroins. Moreover, this highly conserved N-terminal domain was concluded to consist of five positionally conserved α-helices. Structural studies using circular dichroism spectroscopy on recombinantly produced MaSp 1 N- and C-terminal domains showed that these are folded, stable and soluble and that salts or pH has no major effect on their secondary structures...|$|E
30|$|Cylindrical and spherical Bessel {{functions}} are frequently employed in treating boundary value and eigenvalue problems in applied mathematics (Gray and Mathews 1895; McLachlan 1941; Kac 1966). In this work, the general orthogonality relation and Lommel integral of a linear {{combination of both}} cylindrical and spherical Bessel functions, respectively, are considered. For a given radius interval of R < r <γ R, Neumann boundary conditions are assumed and the corresponding approximated first eigenvalues λ _ 1,ν for small λ and ν are compared in their γ-dependency with expressions from the literature in the same limit and the exact numerical solution for cylindrical and spherical Bessel functions, respectively (see Figs. 3, 4). It is shown that all expressions agree well for γ→ 1. Consequently, explicit terms for the orthogonality relation, normalization constant and Lommel integral are given in both model geometries using a discretized form of the respective Bessel differential equations. In the case of spherical Bessel functions, these results are a generalization from integer indices, that can be presented in terms of trigonometric functions and have so mostly to treat related physical problems (Carslaw and Jaeger 1959), to arbitrary complex-valued indices. Moreover, a numerical implementation to calculate the relevant eigenvalues is provided {{and the results are}} applied to a scenario in magnetic resonance physics where spin diffusion processes between two magnetic concentric cylinders or two concentric spheres occur. Thereby, an eigenfunction expansion of the spin transition probability function results in analytic expressions for the expansion coefficients of the frequency autocorrelation function K(t). These are mathematically easier to grasp and, therefore, to implement numerically, than equivalent expressions that have been derived recently (Ziener et al. 2008). The results might be useful to obtain analytical expressions for the transverse relaxation in Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill experiments where Jensen and Chandra have provided a relation between the diffusion-dependent part of transverse relaxation and the frequency autocorrelation function within a weak field approximation (Jensen et al. 2001; Jensen and Chandra 2000). With the paramagnetic properties of deoxygenated hemoglobin, such analyses may then be applied to study highly organized (<b>cylindriform)</b> capillary arrangements in, for instance, skeletal muscle tissue (Ziener et al. 2012). Likewise, the results for spherical geometries may be used to quantify microstructural parameters in lung tissue by treating lung alveoli as spherical entities that are surrounded by a dense capillary network. A further analysis might consider mixed boundary conditions and/or extend the results to other model geometries.|$|E
