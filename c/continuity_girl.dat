50|$|Born Thelma Balle Dunaway in London, {{she began}} {{her career as a}} <b>continuity</b> <b>girl,</b> and then moved up to {{assistant}} editor on films such as The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp before taking the editing role {{for the first time in}} In Which We Serve (1943).

50|$|In post-Zero Hour <b>continuity</b> Night <b>Girl</b> {{made two}} very brief appearances, first in Legionnaires #43 {{as she was}} {{rejected}} at a try-out once again and joined the Legion of Substitute Heroes once more. In {{a nod to the}} previous continuity she noted that, had she been aware Cosmic Boy was on a secret mission, she might not have even made the attempt.|$|R
25|$|There were {{plans to}} turn the show into {{something}} of a reverse spin-off. Schwartz planned to release a spin-off of his series Gossip Girl entitled Valley Girls, originally to premiere {{in the fall of}} 2009.

50|$|The 1985 Crisis on Infinite Earths limited series {{erased the}} {{existence}} of the Earth-Two Superman, and Power <b>Girl's</b> <b>continuity</b> was thus substantially disrupted. Initially she believed herself to be Superman's cousin, as she had been before the reboot. However, her background was retconned; she was told that she was the descendant of the Atlantean sorcerer Arion, and was frozen in suspended animation for millennia until the present day.|$|R
50|$|She {{was born}} Violette Muriel Baker in Tolworth, Surrey, England in 1905. When her {{attempts}} at acting and dancing {{proved to be}} unsuccessful, she accepted work as a <b>continuity</b> <b>girl</b> for British International Pictures. In 1935, she met and married journalist Sydney Box, with whom she collaborated on nearly forty plays with mainly female roles for amateur theatre groups. Their production company, Verity Films, first released short propaganda films, including The English Inn (1941), her first directing effort, after which it branched into fiction. The couple achieved their greatest joint success with The Seventh Veil (1945) for which they gained the Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Screenplay in the following year.|$|E
50|$|Randall {{was born}} on 26 June 1927 in London, England. When World War II began in 1939, Randall, then aged twelve, was sent to Australia aboard the MS Batory. She {{returned}} to England four years later. Soon thereafter, Randall sought employment at Gainsborough Pictures {{in the hopes of}} meeting actor James Mason after seeing him in an advert for his film The Wicked Lady. She did not get to meet Mason, but did manage to secure a job as secretary to the studio's Head of Production, Betty Box. Wishing to be on the studio floor, however, Randall took the lower-paying job of assistant <b>continuity</b> <b>girl</b> (now script supervisor). In this capacity, she worked on such films as Dear Murderer and Ken Annakin's Miranda.|$|E
5000|$|The crew {{consisted}} of over 200 people, {{with the cast}} and extras included this number would increase to over 1000 people working to make the film.Various members of the film's crew portrayed minor characters. First assistant director Roy Stevens played the truck driver who transports Lawrence and Farraj to the Cairo HQ {{at the end of}} Act I; the Sergeant who stops Lawrence and Farraj ("Where do you think you're going to, Mustapha?") is construction assistant Fred Bennett, and screenwriter Robert Bolt has a wordless cameo as one of the officers watching Allenby and Lawrence confer in the courtyard (he is smoking a pipe). Steve Birtles, the film's gaffer, plays the motorcyclist at the Suez Canal; Lean himself is rumoured to be the voice shouting [...] "Who are you?" [...] <b>Continuity</b> <b>girl</b> Barbara Cole appears as one of the nurses in the Damascus hospital scene.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths <b>continuity,</b> Phantom <b>Girl</b> {{is the fifth}} member to join the Legion and {{is a native of}} Bgztl, a planet that exists in the 4th Dimension. Like other Bgztlians, Phantom Girl has the ability to phase out of reality to become intangible. Initially appearing along with Triplicate Girl and Saturn Girl in Action Comics #276 in the story [...] "Supergirl's Three Super Girl-Friends", her first costume consisted of white tights and a white cape with a stylized P on the chest. Phantom Girl's powers serve her well as member of the Legion's Espionage Squad, and she is involved romantically with fellow Legionnaire Ultra Boy for many years. In this continuity, she has a brother, Gmya Wazzo.|$|R
50|$|In this <b>continuity,</b> the <b>girls</b> meet Tenchi on Earth {{because of}} one {{incident}} that takes place two {{years prior to the}} series. At that time, Ryoko and Washu stole a crystal from Jurai and fled towards Earth, pursued by Ayeka, Sasami, Ryo-Ohki, and the Guardians in Ayeka's ship, and Mihoshi and Kiyone in a Galaxy Police ship. They are all injured when Ryoko consumes Ayeka's crystal and becomes a monster. Tenchi defeats the monster when a necklace he is wearing (a memento of his mother, who is implied to be deceased) turns into a sword. During the anniversary party for this event at Tenchi's home, it is revealed that each of the girls has a crystal from the necklace as a token of their bond with Tenchi, which they each took after Ryoko broke Tenchi's necklace apart.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} superheroines {{is one of}} tensions, contradictions and difficulties. Squirrel Girl is no {{stranger}} to these, and her journey through the last twenty years of Marvel comic books has not been easy. In her debut in Marvel Super-Heroes # 8 (S. Ditko and W. Murray, 1992), Squirrel Girl failed to become Iron Man’s sidekick even though she saved him from Doctor Doom. Despite initial success, {{at least in terms of}} the narrative, Squirrel Girl disappeared for over ten years. When she reappeared in 2005, Squirrel Girl was in rather less illustrious surroundings – outside continuity. This article tracks the career of Squirrel Girl, focusing on strategies of narrative and visual representation and the relationship of the character to the structuring principle of <b>continuity.</b> Squirrel <b>Girl</b> demonstrates the ability to wield considerable power outside continuity but even here, where the victories of a woman can be easily disavowed thanks to their structural position within the Marvel universe, Squirrel Girl is still problematic. Various strategies of containment are implemented and this article will engage with these, demonstrating continuity and discontinuity in these policies as Squirrel Girl is ultimately drawn into continuity. Through a close critical reading of Squirrel Girl’s appearances, then, this article will provide initial insights into how powerful women are simultaneously promoted and contained by superhero narratives...|$|R
5000|$|Richard was {{enrolled}} at the Royal Masonic School for Girls at Rickmansworth after her father's death, as Henry had been a Freemason, and help with fees {{was provided by the}} organisation. She found the school unduly strict, and her art mistress called her paintings and drawings [...] "affected, rather like herself." [...] Richard dreamt of becoming a TV <b>continuity</b> <b>girl</b> or film star from a young age and, after leaving school at 15, helped to pay her way though the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London by working in the fashion department at Fortnum and Mason. It was at that time that she decided to change her surname to Richard, because [...] "it was short and neat." [...] While at the Italia Conti, Richard appeared on television with Sammy Davis, Jr. in the ATV programme Sammy Meets the Girls, and also in No Hiding Place.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Knowledge {{about the}} natural history of self-harm is scarce, {{especially}} during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood, a period characterised by a sharp rise in self-inflicted deaths. From a repeated measures cohort of a representative sample, we describe the course of self-harm from middle adolescence to young adulthood. METHODS: A stratified, random sample of 1943 adolescents was recruited from 44 schools across the state of Victoria, Australia, between August, 1992, and January, 2008. We obtained data pertaining to self-harm from questionnaires and telephone interviews at seven waves of follow-up, commencing at mean age 15 · 9 years (SD 0 · 49) and ending at mean age 29 · 0 years (SD 0 · 59). Summary adolescent measures (waves three to six) were obtained for cannabis use, cigarette smoking, high-risk alcohol use, depression and anxiety, antisocial behaviour and parental separation or divorce. FINDINGS: 1802 participants responded in the adolescent phase, with 149 (8 %) reporting self-harm, More girls (95 / 947 [10 %]) than boys (54 / 855 [6 %]) reported self-harm (risk ratio 1 · 6, 95 % CI 1 · 2 - 2 · 2). We recorded a substantial reduction in the frequency of self-harm during late adolescence. 122 of 1652 (7 %) participants who reported self-harm during adolescence reported no further self-harm in young adulthood, with a stronger <b>continuity</b> in <b>girls</b> (13 / 888) than boys (1 / 764). During adolescence, incident self-harm was independently associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety (HR 3 · 7, 95 % CI 2 · 4 - 5 · 9), antisocial behaviour (1 · 9, 1 · 1 - 3 · 4), high-risk alcohol use (2 · 1, 1 · 2 - 3 · 7), cannabis use (2 · 4, 1 · 4 - 4 · 4), and cigarette smoking (1 · 8, 1 · 0 - 3 · 1). Adolescent symptoms of depression and anxiety were clearly associated with incident self-harm in young adulthood (5 · 9, 2 · 2 - 16). INTERPRETATION: Most self-harming behaviour in adolescents resolves spontaneously. The early detection and treatment of common mental disorders during adolescence might constitute an important and hitherto unrecognised component of suicide prevention in young adults.
