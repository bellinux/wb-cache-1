5|$|A {{small group}} of {{toddlers}} show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness {{of the person who}} is being sought. Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior. Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental <b>correlates</b> <b>of</b> disorganized attachment.|$|E
5|$|Aveni {{states that}} one of the {{strengths}} of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the Incas as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material <b>correlates</b> <b>of</b> the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the Han dynasty, in the second century BC.|$|E
5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates surprisingly well with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown that}} some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural <b>correlates</b> <b>of</b> qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} both the forms of sleep are found in mammals and birds, but not in {{reptiles}} (which {{are considered to be}} an intermediate stage) indicates that sleep might have evolved separately in both.

The findings of this study did not reach the. 05 level of significance, however the results seem to indicate that in some cases shared ethnicity is a positive <b>correlate</b> <b>of</b> acceptance of formerly hospitalized mental patients...|$|R

40|$|Much {{work on the}} {{interaction}} of prosody and focus assumes that, crosslinguistically, there is a necessary correlation between the position of main sentence stress (or accent) and focus, and that an intonational pitch change on the focused element is a primary <b>correlate</b> <b>of</b> focus. In this paper, I discuss primary data from three Bantu languages – Chichewa, Durban Zulu and Chitumbuka – and show that in all three languages phonological re-phrasing, not stress, is the main prosodic <b>correlate</b> <b>of</b> focus and that lengthening, not pitch movement, is the main prosodic <b>correlate</b> <b>of</b> phrasing. This result is of interest for the typology of intonation in illustrating languages where intonation has limited use and where, notably, intonation does not highlight focused information {{in the way we}} might expect from European stress languages...|$|R
25|$|Neurological {{research}} {{takes an}} empirical approach, relating mystical experiences to neurological processes. This {{leads to a}} central philosophical issue: does the identification of neural triggers or neural <b>correlates</b> <b>of</b> mystical experiences prove that mystical experiences {{are no more than}} brain events or does it merely identify the brain activity occurring during a genuine cognitive event? The most common positions are that neurology reduces mystical experiences or that neurology is neutral to the issue of mystical cognitivity.|$|E
25|$|As an {{application}} of the free-choice paradigm, the study How Choice Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome (2009) indicates that after making a choice, neural activity in the striatum changes to reflect the person's new evaluation of the choice-object; neural activity increased if the object was chosen, neural activity decreased if the object was rejected. Moreover, studies such as The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2010) and How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural <b>Correlates</b> <b>of</b> Choice Justification (2011) confirm the neural bases of the psychology of cognitive dissonance.|$|E
25|$|The {{contemporary}} {{field of}} behavioral neuroscience focuses on physical causes underpinning behavior. For example, physiological psychologists use animal models, typically rats, {{to study the}} neural, genetic, and cellular mechanisms that underlie specific behaviors such as learning and memory and fear responses. Cognitive neuroscientists investigate the neural <b>correlates</b> <b>of</b> psychological processes in humans using neural imaging tools, and neuropsychologists conduct psychological assessments to determine, for instance, specific aspects and extent of cognitive deficit caused by brain damage or disease. The biopsychosocial model is an integrated perspective toward understanding consciousness, behavior, and social interaction. It assumes that any given behavior or mental process affects and is affected by dynamically interrelated biological, psychological, and social factors.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} characterises the tree {{communities}} {{with respect to}} topographic and climatic variables and identifies the most important environmental <b>correlate</b> <b>of</b> species richness in the southern region of Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot, India. Digitally derived environmental variables in combination with tree species richness information were analysed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to characterise the communities. Multiple regression technique based on stepwise backward elimination was used to identify the most important environment <b>correlate</b> <b>of</b> species richness. Canonical correspondence analysis results in six major tree communities along {{the first and second}} axes. Rainfall is the dominant environmental gradient influencing vegetation patterns on the first CCA axis while elevation showed the highest correlation with the second CCA axis. Backward elimination regression technique yielded rainfall as the most important environmental <b>correlate</b> <b>of</b> species richness. Results were in agreement with the observations in the Neotropics that rainier areas maintain high species diversity...|$|R
