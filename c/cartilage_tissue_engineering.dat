40|$|Abstract: Articular {{cartilage}} {{is characterized}} by its poor capacity for self-repair. Once articular cartilage is injured and defected, it cannot be spontaneously repaired and finally develops osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a major leading cause of severe activity limitations and disability, resulting in worldwide socio-economical burden. At present, there is no established therapy for adequate repair of damaged articular cartilage. Researchers have therefore attempted to establish the <b>cartilage</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>engineering</b> as an effective alternative treatment of cartilage repair. However, the articular cartilage repair still remains a clinical and scientific challenge. In <b>cartilage</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>engineering,</b> {{it is believed that}} cell source, scaffold and growth factors are three key factors for the desired result of cell therapy for the damaged cartilage repair. However, increasing evidence is showing that these key factors are not enough and other factors may be required to achieve the optimal outcome. Since normal articular cartilage is always subjected to mechanical stress in daily activities, mechanical stress has attracted much attention as fourth key factor in <b>cartilage</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>engineering.</b> However, the real impact of mechanical stress on <b>cartilage</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>engineering</b> is far from complete understanding.

However, the amount, homogeneity and stability of the cartilage and bone formed were still insufficient for clinical application.

40|$|Cartilage has a {{very poor}} {{capacity}} for regeneration in vivo.

The aim of this thesis is to find new tools by which <b>cartilage</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>engineering</b> can be better controlled. In head and neck surgery it is important that tissue engineered cartilage is stable and does not mineralize when used for cartilage reconstructions. Therefore, in this thesis our primary focus was the generation of cartilage of a hyaline phenotype that does not mineralize when implanted in vivo. For this purpose we studied expanded chondrocytes and adult bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC).

40|$|Electrospinning is {{a method}} in which {{materials}} in solution are formed into nano- and micro-sized continuous fibers. Recent interest in this technique stems from both the topical nature of nanoscale material fabrication and the considerable potential for use of these nanoscale fibres {{in a range of}} applications including, amongst others, a range of biomedical applications processes such as drug delivery and the use of scaffolds to provide a framework for tissue regeneration in both soft and hard tissue applications systems. The objectives of this review are to describe the theory behind the technique, examine the effect of changing the process parameters on fiber morphology, and discuss the application and impact of electrospinning on the fields of vascular, neural, bone, <b>cartilage,</b> and tendon/ligament <b>tissue</b> <b>engineering...</b>|$|R
40|$|Given the inadequacies of {{existing}} repair strategies for <b>cartilage</b> injuries, <b>tissue</b> <b>engineering</b> approach using biomaterials and stem cells offers new hope for better treatments. Recently, we have fabricated injectable collagen-human {{mesenchymal stem cell}} (hMSC) microspheres using microencapsulation. Apart from providing a protective matrix for cell delivery, the collagen microspheres may also act as a bio-mimetic matrix facilitating the functional remodeling of hMSCs. In this study, whether the encapsulated hMSCs can be pre-differentiated into chondrogenic phenotype prior to implantation has been investigated. The effects of cell seeding density and collagen concentration on the chondrogenic differentiation potential of hMSCs have been studied. An in vivo implantation study has also been conducted. Fabrication of cartilage-like tissue micro-masses was demonstrated by positive immunohistochemical staining for cartilage-specific extracellular matrix components including type II collagen and aggrecan. The meshwork of collagen fibers was remodeled into a highly ordered microstructure, characterized by thick and parallel bundles, upon differentiation. Higher cell seeding density and higher collagen concentration favored the chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs, yielding increased matrix production and mechanical strength of the micro-masses. These micro-masses were also demonstrated to integrate well with the host tissue in NOD/SCID mice. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
