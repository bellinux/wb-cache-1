5|$|In 1938, Hitler {{decided that}} the old Reich <b>Chancellery</b> was not big enough to house the {{ministries}} of the Third Reich. He assigned his favorite architect Albert Speer to build the new <b>Chancellery.</b> After the massive renovations were completed in early 1939 per Hitler's insistence, the globe {{was moved to the}} Führer's new office located {{at the heart of the}} new <b>Chancellery,</b> where it remained until the Soviets occupied the building in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Poland, {{he was appointed}} to the Royal <b>Chancellery,</b> and soon became a favorite secretary to King Sigismund II. In 1567 he commanded a royal task force, sent to remove the noble family of Starzechowscy from the royal lands they were decreed to hold illegally. Another major task he completed at that time was the reorganization of the <b>Chancellery</b> archive.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Adolf Hitler {{decided to}} expand the Reich <b>Chancellery</b> (Reichskanzlei), which he {{considered}} too small for his needs. On 21 July 1935, Leonhard Gall submitted plans for a large reception hall (that {{could also be used}} as a ballroom) to be built onto the old <b>Chancellery.</b> The drawings were unique because of the large cellar that led a further one-and-a-half meters down to a bunker which later became known as the Vorbunker.|$|E
5|$|As the SS grew in {{size and}} importance, so too did Hitler's {{personal}} protection units. Three main SS groups were assigned to protect Hitler. In 1933, his larger personal bodyguard unit (previously the 1st SS-Standarte) was called to Berlin to replace the Army <b>Chancellery</b> Guard, assigned to protect the Chancellor of Germany. Sepp Dietrich commanded the new unit, previously known as SS-Stabswache Berlin; the name was changed to SS-Sonderkommando Berlin. In November 1933, the name was changed to Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. In April 1934, Himmler modified the name to Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). The LSSAH guarded Hitler's private residences and offices, providing an outer ring of protection for the Führer and his visitors. LSSAH men manned sentry posts at the entrances to the old Reich <b>Chancellery</b> and the new Reich <b>Chancellery.</b> The number of LSSAH guards was increased during special events. At the Berghof, Hitler's residence in the Obersalzberg, a large contingent of the LSSAH patrolled an extensive cordoned security zone.|$|E
5|$|Latin {{documents}} {{used the}} term Wallachia or Wallachia maior (‘Greater Wallachia’) for Muntenia (which first appeared in 1373), and Wallachia minor (‘Lesser Wallachia’) for Oltenia (first recorded in 1377). The new country was identified as terra transalpina (‘land beyond the mountains’) or partes transalpinae (‘parts beyond the mountains’) in documents issued by the Royal <b>Chancellery</b> of Hungary in the entire 14th century. The terminology of the Hungarian <b>chancellery</b> was also used in the Latin documents of the Wallachian voivodes.|$|E

5|$|On 30 April 1945, when Soviet {{troops were}} within {{a block or}} two of the Reich <b>Chancellery,</b> Hitler shot himself and Braun bit into a cyanide capsule. Their bodies were carried outside to the bombed-out garden behind the Reich <b>Chancellery,</b> where they were placed in a bomb crater and doused with petrol. The corpses were set on fire as the Red Army {{shelling}} continued. Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Joseph Goebbels assumed Hitler's roles as head of state and chancellor respectively.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Báthory {{was elected}} King of Poland on 15 December 1575. He adopted {{the title of}} Prince of Transylvania and made Christopher voivode on 14 January 1576. An Ottoman {{delegation}} confirmed Christopher's appointment at the Diet in Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania) in July. The sultan's charter (or ahidnâme) sent to Christopher emphasized that he should keep the peace along the frontiers. Stephen set up a separate <b>chancellery</b> in Kraków {{to keep an eye}} on the administration of Transylvania. The head of the new <b>chancellery,</b> Márton Berzeviczy, and Christopher cooperated closely.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} {{is located at}} Rideau Hall, the official residence of the monarch and the governor general. The governor general, as the personal representative of the Canadian monarch, is the highest authority in Canadian heraldry. Below the governor general is the Herald Chancellor, a position held {{by the secretary of}} the governor general. The CHA is currently organized in an office called the <b>Chancellery</b> of Honours, the same office that issues Canadian orders and decorations, such as the Order of Canada. The deputy secretary that administers the <b>Chancellery</b> of Honours is also the Deputy Herald Chancellor.|$|E

5|$|The {{ruins of}} both <b>Chancellery</b> {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 {{as part of}} an effort to destroy the landmarks of Nazi Germany. The bunker largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947, the Soviets tried to blow up the bunker, but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959, the East German government began a series of demolitions of the <b>Chancellery,</b> including the bunker. Because it was near the Berlin Wall, the site was undeveloped and neglected until 1988–89. During extensive construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site, work crews uncovered several underground sections of the old bunker complex; for the most part these were destroyed. Other parts of the <b>Chancellery</b> underground complex were uncovered, but these were ignored, filled in, or resealed.|$|E
5|$|Weidling {{had given}} the order for the {{survivors}} to break out to the north-west; the plan got underway at around 23:00. The first group from the Reich <b>Chancellery,</b> led by Mohnke, tried but could not break through the Soviet rings and was captured the next day. Like others from the Führerbunker who were captured, he was interrogated by SMERSH. On the third break-out attempt from the Reich <b>Chancellery,</b> made around 01:00 (2 May), Bormann managed to cross the Spree. Arthur Axmann, who followed the same route, reported seeing Bormann's body {{a short distance from}} the Weidendammer bridge.|$|E
5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the <b>Chancellery,</b> where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the <b>Chancellery</b> garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which did not move.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>Chancellery</b> project, the pogrom of Kristallnacht took place. Speer made {{no mention}} of it in the first draft of Inside the Third Reich, and it was only on the urgent advice of his {{publisher}} that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car.|$|E
5|$|Government {{authorities}} {{wanted to}} destroy {{the last vestiges of}} these Nazi landmarks. The construction of the buildings in the area around the Führerbunker was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the <b>Chancellery</b> gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{transferred}} {{his headquarters}} to the Führerbunker ("Leader's bunker") in Berlin on 16 January 1945, where he (along with Bormann, his secretary Else Krüger, and others) remained {{until the end}} of April. The Führerbunker was located under the Reich <b>Chancellery</b> garden in the government district in the centre of the city. The Battle of Berlin, the final major Soviet offensive of the war, began on 16 April 1945. By 19 April the Red Army started to encircle the city. On 20 April, his 56th birthday, Hitler made his last trip to the surface. In the ruined garden of the Reich <b>Chancellery,</b> he awarded Iron Crosses to boy soldiers of the Hitler Youth. That afternoon, Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time. On 23 April, Albert Bormann left the bunker complex and flew to the Obersalzberg. He and several others had been ordered by Hitler to leave Berlin.|$|E
50|$|Many huzvarishn {{were listed}} in the lexicon Frahang-i Pahlavig. The {{practice}} of using these logograms appears to have originated {{from the use of}} Aramaic in the <b>chancelleries</b> of the Achaemenid Empire.
