This paper describes an auto exhaust particulate sampling system developed at Esso Research and Engineering Company. This system is capable of frequent and convenient operation, is compatible with constant volume sampling (CVS) of auto exhaust, and collects particulate matter at constant temperature during the 1972 or 1975 Federal Test Procedure.

40|$|Abstract — Cooperative vehicle safety (CVS) systems rely on {{vehicular}} ad-hoc networks {{operating in}} broadcast mode to deliver vehicle tracking and safety information to neighboring cars. This information {{is used to}} enable collision avoidance and warning systems. One of the main challenges of the eventual large scale deployment of such systems is network congestion, which could critically degrade {{the quality of a}} <b>CVS</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper, we present a method for congestion monitoring and control based on limited feedback from the network. We study the relationship between channel occupancy, as a readily available feedback measure, controllable network parameters, and network performance. We describe a performance measure relevant to CVS systems and present a congestion control method, based on channel occupancy measurements, that robustly maintains the system performance near optimal operation points. We examine the convergence properties of the congestion control algorithm and provide guidelines for the design of such systems based on network and traffic density conditions. Through simulation experiments we show significant gains in performance when closed loop congestion control methods are applied. Keywords-VANET; vehicle safety; congestion control;broadcast I...|$|E

Irrespective of cell lines and models, the cytotoxicity of anti-glaucoma PG eyedrops was primarily related to the concentration of benzalkonium chloride (BAK) contained in the eyedrops as a preservative. Accordingly, preservative-free tafluprost was apparently less cytotoxic than BAK-preserved PG analogs. Furthermore, our study for cytotoxicity assays on ocular cells, conducted by comprehensive investigations covering a variety of concentrations and treatment times, which is termed the cell viability score (<b>CVS)</b> <b>system,</b> demonstrated that 0. 001 % BAK-preserved tafluprost was not cytotoxic, and suggested that tafluprost may even reduce the cytotoxic effect of BAK.

Beside embolism, this is mainly related to the flow in the cardiovascular (<b>CV)</b> <b>system.</b> Device cannulation to the <b>CV</b> <b>system</b> is therefore an important consideration for many applications such as cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or cardiac support. In this study, a two-sided fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) model was developed to simulate the flow in the <b>CV</b> <b>system</b> for physiological and pathological conditions. The geometry was obtained from MRI records of healthy male volunteers, including aorta and greater arteries. Initial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) studies of CPB and Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) support conditions {{as well as a}} Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) validation (differences CFD/PIV < 10 %) were performed, followed by FSI simulations of physiological flow conditions and the CPB approach. The material data (Youngâs modulus) was based on literature. Two-way solver coupling was set between the structural analysis of the thin aortic wall and the fluid flow in the whole <b>CV</b> <b>system.</b> The flow to each vessel was analysed, as well as velocities, shear stress and pressure distribution. For some cannula positions in the ascending aorta, blood is withdrawn out of the brachiocephalic trunk due to the venturi effect.

40|$|The {{constant}} volume sampling (CVS) {{method has}} been used to support vehicle emissions testing for over 25 years and the ‘bag’ measurement of emissions is the key method that is used for legislative purposes. Bag measurements provide a single figure for CO, CO 2, and NOx emissions species for the complete drive cycle, but provide no information on the profile throughout the test. Instantaneous emissions measurements undertaken on a second-by-second basis are carried out to assess catalyst and engine system performance. The key measurement for this approach is the determination of the instantaneous exhaust mass flowrate, which allows the instantaneous gravimetric emissions to be calculated. Being able to accurately measure instantaneous emissions carries its own challenges, but the mixing effects in the <b>CVS</b> <b>system</b> when using the CO 2 tracer technique have been shown to compromise significantly the capability to determine exhaust volume flowrates accurately.

Nevertheless, the limited power, processing and bandwidth resources is a major issue for the existing solutions, not well addressed by the standard video compression techniques.

40|$|Introduction: A {{cardiovascular}} and {{circulatory system}} (CVS) {{model has been}} validated in silico, and in several animal model studies. It accounts for valve dynamics by means of Heaviside function to simulate “open on pressure, close on flow” law. Thus, it does not consider the real time scale of the valve aperture and thus doesn’t fully capture valve dysfunction. This research couples the CVS model with a model describing the progressive aperture of the mitral valve. Method: We used a <b>CVS</b> <b>system</b> model with 6 elastic chambers (left and right ventricles, vena cava, aorta, pulmonary artery and veins) also accounting for ventricular {{interaction by means of}} septum displacement. The mitral valve aperture was modelled by considering the pressure forces induced by blood flow during a complete cardiac cycle. This valve equation was coupled with the CVS model to simulate cardiac hemodynamics with healthy and diseased regurgitating valves. Results: We compared the simulations with the initial CVS model and the Heaviside valve law and with the new model including variable mitral valve aperture. Hemodynamics variables trends in both models show a good correlation and the new model describes accurately the opening and closing of the valve as expected physiologically. Despite the large number of parameters to optimise, we simulated realistically mitral valve regurgitation and found pressure-volume loops comparable to those observed clinically. Conclusions: This work describes a new coupled model of the cardiovascular system that accounts for progressive mitral valve aperture. Simulations show good correlation with physiologically expected results for healthy or diseased valves. The large number of valve model parameters indicates a need for emerging, lighter and minimal mitral valve models that are readily identifiable to achieve full benefit in real-time use. These results suggest a further use of this model to track, diagnose and control valves pathologies...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: A {{model for}} the {{cardiovascular}} and circulatory systems (CVS) has previously been validated in silico, {{as well as in}} porcine models of pulmonary embolism (PE), septic shock, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titrations at different volemic levels. An accurate <b>CVS</b> <b>system</b> model can be used to monitor and diagnose dysfunction and support clinical decisions. This research validates this model with respect to inotrope therapy commonly used in circulatory support, prior to first human clinical trials. Method: The model and parameter identification process is used to study the effect of different adrenaline doses in healthy and critically ill patients. The hemodynamic effects on arterial blood pressures and stroke volume (cardiac index) are simulated in the model and adrenaline-specific parameters identified. These parameters are then used to capture and predict the future responses to a change in dose and-or over time. Results are compared to clinical data from 3 adrenaline published dosing studies, comprising a total of N= 37 data sets. Results: All identified parameter trends match clinically expected changes. The adrenaline-specific parameters are physiologically relevant. Absolute percentage errors for the patient-specific, predicted hemodynamic responses (N= 15) are within 10 % compared to clinical data. The adrenaline-specific parameters accurately and uniquely capture the impact of inotrope therapy on the CVS, independent of other model parameters. Conclusions: Clinically accurate prediction of the impact of circulatory support drugs, such as adrenaline, offers significant clinical potential for this type of model-based application. Overall, this work represents a further clinical validation of the underlying fundamental CVS model and methods, and their use for cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy selection in critical care. These results are presented as (further) justification for (beginning) human trials of this model-based diagnostic and therapeutic approach...|$|E

40|$|Exhaust {{emissions}} of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) from passenger vehicles are usually estimated {{only for the}} particle phase via the total particulate matter measurements. However, {{they also need to}} be estimated for the gas phase, as they are semi-volatile. To better estimate SVOC emission factors of passenger vehicles, a measurement campaign using a chassis dynamometer was conducted with different instruments: (1) a constant volume sampling (<b>CVS)</b> <b>system</b> in which emissions were diluted with filtered air and sampling was performed on filters and polyurethane foams (PUF) and (2) a Dekati Fine Particle Sampler (FPS) in which emissions were diluted with purified air and sampled with on-line instruments (PTR-ToF-MS, HR-ToF-AMS, MAAP, CPC). Significant differences in the concentrations of organic carbon (OC) measured by the instruments are observed. The differences can be explained by sampling artefacts, differences between (1) the time elapsed during sampling (in the case of filter and PUF sampling) and (2) the time elapsed from emission to measurement (in the case of on-line instruments), which vary from a few seconds to 15 min, and by the different dilution factors. To relate elapsed times and measured concentrations of OC, the condensation of SVOC between the gas and particle phases is simulated with a dynamic aerosol model. The simulation results allow us to understand the relation between elapsed times and concentrations in the gas and particle phases. They indicate that the characteristic times to reach thermodynamic equilibrium between gas and particle phases may be as long as 8 min. Therefore, if the elapsed time is less than this characteristic time to reach equilibrium, gasphase SVOC are not at equilibriumwith the particle phase and a larger fraction of emitted SVOC will be in the gas phase than estimated by equilibrium theory, leading to an underestimation of emitted OC if only the particle phase is considered or if the gas-phase SVOC are estimated by equilibrium theory. Current European emission inventories for passenger cars do not yet estimate gas-phase SVOC emissions, although they may represent 60 % of total emitted SVOC (gas þ particle phases) ...|$|E
40|$|The need {{of better}} {{understanding}} and further {{improvement of the}} operation of modern low emission vehicles has drawn the attention on fast response time resolved emission measurements. The Constant Volume Sampling system (CVS), which is the main setup described by the European Union legislation for the sampling, dilution and measurement of motor vehicle tailpipe emissions over a certain driving cycle, can provide such data. The time resolution of the recorded data though is low due to design limitations of such systems. Transport delays in tubes, mixing and dispersion phenomena etc. are responsible for smoothening and distortion of the original emission signal. Aim of the current thesis {{is to develop a}} model to compensate for all these distortion sources, by taking into account the dynamic behaviour of the system. The problem was approached with purely mathematical tools derived from system theory. The <b>CVS</b> <b>system</b> was approached as a combination of different subsystems in series, that were individually modelled due to the specific design and flow characteristics of each. The parameters of each subsystem were estimated using measurements of the subsystem response to known and controlled artificial emission step inputs. The model of each subsystem was inverted and a specifically designed filter was applied to compensate for the noise of the inverted signal. The final model was designed such as to be applicable to already available or future measurements performed on the modelled setup. The model is also applicable on similar exhaust gas sampling and measurement setups with the need of specific system parameter identification measurements. The performance of the final model was evaluated compared against a sophisticated ultra fast response analyzer over a transient driving cycle. The model was proven to be able to reproduce the original signal with high accuracy. Furthermore, applications of the model on measurement devices that are used in series or parallel to the CVS setup were also presented. The methodology was able to reveal phenomena related to gaseous and particulate emission measurements that could not be revealed due to the limited time resolution of the original measurement output. ...|$|E
40|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) {{agencies}} are implementing {{a series of}} regulations that will control emissions, including oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), from diesel engines during “in-use” conditions. The purpose is to ensure the emission standards can be maintained {{throughout the course of}} the engine’s useful lifetime. One of the most important regulations with respect to controlling in-use emissions is the Not-To-Exceed (NTE) regulation. This regulation sets limits for pollutants that are emitted during operation in a defined portion of the engine map and specifies the protocols required to make those measurements. Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) are critical for the implementation of these in-use regulations.

A comprehensive program was completed for the gas-phase measurement allowance (Miller et al., 2008; Buckingham et al. 2007; Fiest et al. 2007). This report presents the results of the in-use validation portion of the PM measurement allowance program. The MASC approach pursued an experimental program to try to use laboratory measurements and modeling to characterize errors that might be observed with in-use, and then validate those errors with in-use testing. The development of the MA involved a sophisticated Monte Carlo model that considered laboratory measurement errors associated with engine broadcast information, emissions measurements, affects due to ambient conditions, and affects that might be observed due to on-vehicle operating conditions. The in-use validation effort used the same PEMS systems used for the laboratory testing, but under real-world conditions. The idea was that the errors found in-use should be within the bounds of the proposed MA. For this program, comparisons were made between the PM PEMS and UCR’s Mobile Emissions Laboratory (MEL) reference laboratory under in-use on-road driving conditions. The MEL is unique in that it contains a full 1065 compliant constant volume sampling (<b>CVS)</b> <b>system</b> with gravimetric PM measurements, while being fully operational under on-the-road driving conditions. Two PEMS manufacturers were selected for the in-use validation testing, and multiple serial numbers of each of the selected PEMS were included in the in-use testing. Measurements were made from one class 8 heavy-duty diesel vehicle equipped with a original equipment manufacturer (OEM) diesel particulate filter (DPF). A bypass system was designed to simulate a failed DPF while maintaining the functionality of the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC). The bypass was designed to target an in-use bsPM emission level of 25 mg/hp-h. In-use routes were designed and utilized to exercise the PM PEMS equipment over a range of environmental conditions, and included segments near sea level, in coastal regions, in desert regions, and longer uphill incline segments and segments at elevations up to 4500 ft. Prior to validation testing, the MEL underwent a series of 1065 audits and a cross laboratory correlation with SwRI. All PM PEMS and PM instruments tested showed a negative bias compared to the reference system. The PEMS 2 non-regeneration mean bias at the 20 mg/hp-h bsPM emissions was - 10 mg/hp-h, and at 30 mg/hp-h the mean bias was - 18 mg/hp-h. When the intercept was forced through zero, the mean bias at 20 mg/hp-h went to - 15 mg/hp-h. The PEMS 3 non-regeneration mean bias at the 20 mg/hp-h bsPM emissions was - 1. 7 mg/hp-h, and at 30 mg/hp-h the mean bias was - 2. 2 mg/hp-h. When the intercept was forced through zero, the PEMS 3 mean bias went to - 1 mg/hp-h at the 20 mg/hp-h level. The other instruments used showed a higher mean bias than PEMS 3 and lower mean bias than PEMS 2. The proposed bsPM MA is 6 mg/hp-h at the 20 mg/hp-h in-use standard. For these results, the PEMS 3 system was within the proposed MA, while the PEMS 2 values exceeded the proposed MA. Several issues were discovered during testing, including problems related to testing under in-use conditions, operational issues, and post processing issues. The in-use issues ranged from electrical and mechanical connections, crystal usage from short NTE’s, valve switching, measurement signals, and crystal behaviors. Operational problems occurred during startup, commissioning, and with the systems prior to testing in-use. Typical issues include incorrect system configurations, procedures that don’t work, and issues with the startup software and other recommended practices that didn’t function according to the manual. The post processing issues ranged from data filtering, bsPM differences between processor versions, data identification, and method calculations not being available. In general, PEMS 2 had more issues than PEMS 3 for each of these categories...|$|E
