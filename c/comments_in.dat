5|$|A {{number of}} governments linked the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to UN Peacekeepers in 1988 to the UNTAG operation, but the award {{was shared by}} peacekeepers and {{peacekeeping}} operations worldwide. Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar mentioned a number of UN peacekeeping operations (including Namibia) in his Nobel lecture in Oslo on 9 January 1989. Senator Graham Richardson also made similar <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> the Australian Senate.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{reflected}} {{on drug use}} in athletics {{in an interview with}} Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent for the BBC's Inside Sport programme. Chambers claimed there would always be athletes using performance-enhancing drugs because drug testers did not keep pace with advances in science and that athletes who took drugs had an immense advantage over those who remained clean. Chambers was roundly condemned for his <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> the interview by both the press and his former colleagues in the athletics world, including Sir Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Sebastian Coe, although former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers' claims.|$|E

5|$|Gottlieb, {{aided by}} Newman and Reinhardt, drafted a rebuttal, which {{was signed by}} 12 {{painters}} and three sculptors, and addressed {{to the editor of}} the Tribune. It was never published. Weldon Kees discussed the issue of the open letter further in the June 5 edition of The Nation, calling director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Francis Henry Taylor a philistine. Two days later Time magazine noted the protest in an article entitled The Revolt of the Pelicans, an oblique reference to Taylor's 1948 <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> the Atlantic Monthly.|$|E
5|$|Grace <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> {{his memoirs}} {{that he was}} glad to make his {{hundredth}} century at Gloucestershire's ground. Excluding the two centuries not considered first-class by some modern statisticians, Grace's hundredth century came later in the same month when he scored 169 for Gloucestershire against Middlesex at Lord's. He scored his final first-class century in July 1904 for London County, reaching 166 against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He played first-class cricket for another four seasons, and scored 15 and 25 for the Gentlemen of England in his final outing, an innings defeat against Surrey.|$|E
5|$|In 1852 Staunton {{published}} his book The Chess Tournament, which recounted {{in detail the}} efforts required to make the London International Tournament happen and presented all the games with his comments on the play. Unfortunately some of Staunton's <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> the book and in The Illustrated London News were intemperate, because he was disappointed with the placing he achieved.|$|E

5|$|In February 2007, a {{controversy}} arose after Brown's appearance at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts {{as part of}} a debate on gay marriage. The high school students had launched a Facebook group attack on Brown and had made a derogatory remark about his daughter, Ayla. During his presentation, Brown defended himself and his daughter by directly quoting several vulgar statements they had made and announcing the names of the students who had written the statements. Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> front of a high school audience.|$|E
5|$|Tacitus' major {{historical}} works, including The Histories and Agricola's biography, {{were all}} written and published under Domitian's successors Nerva (96–98) and Trajan (98–117). Unfortunately, {{the part of}} Tacitus' Histories dealing with {{the reign of the}} Flavian dynasty is almost entirely lost. His views on Domitian survive through brief <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> its first five books, and the short but highly negative characterization in Agricola in which he severely criticizes Domitian's military endeavours. Nevertheless, Tacitus admits his debt to the Flavians with regard to his own public career.|$|E
5|$|Tallon missed {{selection}} {{during the}} 195152 season due his increasingly error-prone glovework and {{a combination of}} health reasons including stomach ulcers and deafness. He did not play a first-class match {{because of lack of}} his fitness. In any case, Tallon had secretly been barred from selection by the Australian Board of Control for making unauthorised <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> the media; this fact was not revealed for half a century.|$|E

5|$|The {{respondents}} {{also noted}} that Gaudron made similar <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> the Stolen Generations case, which also considered non-judicial detention {{in the context of}} Aboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their parents' care. For this reason and others, they argued that the power to detain people for the purposes of criminal trial and punishment (as opposed to detention generally) was clearly a judicial function, but there is no general rule and other powers to detain may not offend Chapter III.|$|E
5|$|As {{the radio}} {{programme}} became popular, daily newspapers in Pune began printing {{the lyrics of}} the new songs each week. The publication department of All India Radio also compiled the lyrics and excerpts from the introductory <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> a book form. The 179-page volume, then priced at 2, was launched on 3 October 1957 {{on the occasion of}} Vijayadashami. In 1965, the HMV released ten LPs featuring the voice of Sudhir Phadke. In 1968, the Gramophone Company of India released a 10-cassette set, again featuring Phadke's voice, and 50,000 records were sold. Madgulkar's son, Anand, produced a televised version showcasing twenty-eight episodes of the Geet Ramayan on Zee Marathi; however, it received a lukewarm response. He has also written a book, Geet Ramayanache Ramayan, describing the making of the radio programme. Live shows of Geet Ramayan are still produced on occasion of Rama Navami.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle is an {{ambassador}} for the Kick It Out scheme, which campaigns for inclusion and equality in football. He is also {{currently on the}} Management Committee of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), and it was announced on 17 November 2010 that Carlisle would succeed Chris Powell {{as the chairman of}} the PFA. As part of his work with the PFA, he collects the views of his fellow professionals and reports back to the committee. He also visits local schools to give talks to the students. Carlisle was among those who criticised FIFA president Sepp Blatter following his <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> November 2011 that racism was no longer a problem in football. In February 2012, he was part of a PFA delegation that met with British Prime Minister David Cameron to discuss the issues of racism and homophobia in the sport.|$|E

5|$|For {{three of}} the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. No, it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what {{turns out to be}} an American problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it is American assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island {{at the end of the}} novel to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E
5|$|Imaginos was envisioned {{as a rock}} opera to be {{published}} as a trilogy of double albums, with a storyline encompassing about two hundred years of history, {{from the beginning of}} the 19th century to the end of the 20th. This album represents an abbreviated version of the first volume of that planned trilogy, but with the songs arranged out of order, rendering the story harder to comprehend. Even when the song lyrics are analyzed in the chronological order that was devised by the authors and is followed in this section, the narrative progression is scarce and the content often difficult to decipher for the casual reader. However, thanks to various <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> interviews by Pearlman and Bouchard, and the extensive sleeve notes by Pearlman that were issued with the original release, it is possible to reconstruct the story to a great extent.|$|E
5|$|In early 1932, {{a letter}} Rhoads {{had written in}} November 1931, which disparaged Puerto Ricans and claimed he had killed and {{intentionally}} injected cancer cells into his patients, was given by a lab assistant to Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. He publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media, {{which led to a}} scandal, an official investigation, and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests. In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> anger and as a joke to a New York colleague. Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community found evidence of his or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal was forgotten.|$|E

5|$|In {{ex parte}} Hosenball, Lord Denning {{referred}} to Lord Reid's <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> R. v. Lewes Justices, ex parte Secretary of State for Home Department (1972), {{that there was}} a public interest for certain documents in the police's possession not to be produced during court proceedings, otherwise members of the public might withhold information from the police if they realized the potential existed for the information to be disclosed to the Gaming Board. Such withholding of information would prevent the police from properly discharging their statutory duty of ensuring that unsuitable persons were not granted licences to run gaming establishments. Lord Reid stated that the requirement for natural justice in that case was clearly outweighed by the public interest.|$|E
5|$|Informed of the King's decision, Le Gris {{contacted}} Jean Le Coq, {{widely considered}} the best lawyer {{of the day in}} France. Le Coq kept meticulous notes of the entire trial process and it is through his record that many of {{the facts of the case}} are known. Le Coq also <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> his records his own suspicions about his client, whose claims of innocence he considered to be false. Le Gris was urged by his family and lawyer to insist on being tried in a church court, which as a cleric in minor orders was his right. This would have given him a more favourable hearing in a court which did not condone trial by combat and thus would also be much safer. Le Gris rebuffed this advice and became angry when challenged on the decision, insisting on his right to trial before the Parlement.|$|E
5|$|To help {{drive his}} points, Curtis uses {{interviews}} with various political and intellectual figures. In {{the first two}} parts, former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency member Anne Cahn and former American Spectator writer David Brock accuse the neoconservatives of knowingly using false evidence of wrongdoing in their campaigns against the Soviet Union and President Bill Clinton. Jason Burke, author of , <b>comments</b> <b>in</b> The Shadows in the Cave on the failure to expose a massive terrorist network in Afghanistan. Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film's narrative. Neoconservatives William and Irving Kristol, Richard Pipes, Richard Perle and Michael Ledeen are invited to provide a neoconservative view of the film's subject. The history of Islamism is discussed by the Institute of Islamic Political Thought's Azzam Tamimi, political scientist Roxanne Euben, and Islamist Abdullah Anas.|$|E
