40|$|Can {{the central}} bank of a small open economy be {{mandated}} with the maintenance of both fixed exchange rates and monetary independence, and still succeed in the long term? Looking at a pioneering experiment put {{in place by the}} National Bank of Belgium, this article shows how foreign exchange policy allowed for persistent violations of the predictions of the trilemma in the 1850 s. Success was based on four main ingredients. First, the credibility of the peg was not built through the stabilisation of exchange rates, but through the stabilisation of central bank liquidity (i. e. the ‘margin of manoeuvre’ available for <b>countercyclical</b> <b>action)</b> : based on constructive ambiguity, this strategy positively influenced market expectations. Second, the stock of bullion circulating in the country acted as a buffer for central bank reserves. Third, the banking system had a structural liquidity deficit towards {{the central bank}}. Fourth, the central bank was big enough to meet the domestic demand of credit and accumulate foreign reserves at the same time. These findings shed new light on the nature of monetary policy and its implementation in the 19 th century. Foreign exchange policy, monetary policy implementation, reserve management...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{investigate}} {{the role of}} market orientation in advertising spending during economic contraction. They use the 2001 economic collapse in Turkey as the empirical context in which to test hypotheses regarding why some firms increase their advertising spending in a contraction period {{while the majority of}} firms cut back. Analyzing market orientation at the level of its intelligence and responsiveness facets, they find the responsiveness facet to be positively associated with increases in advertising spending but observe the intelligence facet to be negatively associated with advertising spending. Importantly, positive shifts in advertising spending during the economic contraction predict better subsequent business performance. The opposing roles of the intelligence and responsiveness facets disappear in a subsequent economic expansion period. These findings have managerial and theoretical implications. Firms that nurture the responsiveness facet of market orientation during economic contractions go against the tide to increase their advertising spending and experience the performance benefits that such <b>countercyclical</b> <b>actions</b> can amass. © 2014, American Marketing Association...|$|R
40|$|Chairman Jordon, Ranking Member Kucinich, {{and other}} members of the Committee, thank you for the {{opportunity}} to testify on the impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, enacted two years ago this week. My empirical research during the past two years shows that ARRA did not have a significant impact in stimulating the economy. 1 I do not think this finding should come as a surprise. Earlier research on the discretionary countercyclical Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 — enacted three years ago this week—indicates that it too did little to stimulate the economy. 2 Research on the discretionary <b>countercyclical</b> <b>actions</b> in the late 1960 s and 1970 s—the most recent period of such large interventions prior to this past decade—also shows disappointing results, including high unemployment, high inflation, high interest rates, and frequent recessions; the poor results of the 1970 s policies led top macroeconomists to write influential papers, such as “After Keynesian Macroeconomics, ” which questioned the whole approach and to decry “that countercyclical discretionary fiscal policy is neither desirable nor politically feasible. ” 3 My purpose here today is not to explain this recent revival of a failed approach to policy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact {{of changes in the}} level of {{taxation}} on economic activity. The key contribution is the use of the narrative record presidential speeches, executive-branch documents, and Congressional reports to identify the size, timing, and principal motivation for all major postwar policy actions that changed revenues. The classification of motivation allows us to separate tax changes into those taken for reasons related to prospective economic conditions, such as <b>countercyclical</b> <b>actions</b> and tax changes tied to changes in government spending, from those taken for more exogenous reasons, such as to reduce an inherited budget deficit or to promote long-run growth. We then examine the behavior of output following these more exogenous changes. The resulting estimates indicate that tax increases are highly contractionary. The effects are strongly significant, highly robust, and much larger than those obtained using broader measures of tax changes. The large effect stems in considerable part from a powerful negative effect of tax increases on investment. We also find that tax changes intended to counteract projected changes in private economic activity have been largely unsuccessful, and that tax increases designed to reduce a persistent budget deficit appear to have much smaller output costs than other exogenous tax increases...|$|R
40|$|The asymmetric, cointegrating {{relationship}} between the return on equity market and the narrowly defined money supply is documented. In fact, equity return and the monthly percentage change in the Colombian money supply M 1 spread adjusts to the threshold value slower when a contractionary <b>countercyclical</b> policy <b>action</b> or an economic shock causes the money supply M 1 to fall relative to the share price index, widening their spread, than when an expansionary <b>countercyclical</b> monetary policy <b>action</b> or a shock causes money supply M 1 {{to move in the}} opposite direction, narrowing their spread. The empirical findings further indicate the impact lag on the Colombian monetary policy in the equity market is two years. These empirical findings should be of interest to both domestic and international investors who are interested in the Colombian equity market. The results also reveal the presence of both the neoclassical and the post-Keynesian positions on the {{relationship between}} equity return and money supply M 1 in the Colombian financial market. In the age of globalization, these findings may provide {{a better understanding of the}} impact of the countercyclical monetary policy on the equity market in Latin American economies. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a DSGE model {{to examine the}} quantitative macroeconomic implications of counter-cyclical fiscal policy for France, Germany and the UK. The model incorporates real wage rigidity and consumption habits, as the particular market failures justifying policy intervention. We subject the model to productivity shocks and allow policy instruments {{to react to the}} output gap and the debt-to-output ratio. A welfare analysis reveals that the most effective instrument-target combination is to use public consumption to stabilize the output gap. Moreover, welfare gains from counter-cyclical fiscal policy are much stronger in the presence of wage rigidities compared with consumption habits. Finally, since active policy and automatic stabilizers are substitutes, it is possible that relatively undistorted economies may be in need of <b>countercyclical</b> fiscal <b>action</b> due to inadequate automatic stabilizers...|$|R

50|$|New {{classical}} macroeconomics led by Robert E. Lucas {{also have}} {{had its own}} Phillips curve. However, things are far more complicated in these models, since rational expectations were presumed. For Lucas, the island models made up the general framework in which the mechanisms underlying the Phillips curve could be scrutinized. The purpose of the first Lucasian island model (1972) was to establish a framework to support {{the understanding of the}} nature of the relationship between inflation and real economic performance by assuming that this relation offers no trade-off exploitable by economic policy. Lucas’ intention was to prove that the Phillips curve exists without existing. It has been a heritage that there is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment or real economic performance, so it is undoubted that there is a short run Phillips curve (or there are short run Phillips curves). Although there are fewer possible actions available for the monetary policy to conceit people in order to increase the labour supply, unexpected changes can always trigger real changes. But what is the ultimate purpose of the central bank when changing the money supply? For example, and mostly: exerting countercyclical control. Doing so, monetary policy would increase the money supply in order to eliminate the negative effects of an unfavourable macreconomic shock. However, monetary policy is not able to utilize the trade-off between inflation and real economic performance, because there is no information available in advance about the shocks to eliminate. Under these conditions, the central bank is unable to plan a course of action, that is, a countercyclical monetary policy. Rational agents can be conceited only by unexpected changes, so a well-known economic policy is completely in vain. However, and this is the point, the central bank cannot outline unforeseeable interventions in advance, because it has no informational advantage over the agents. The central bank has no information about what to eliminiate through <b>countercyclical</b> <b>actions.</b> The trade-off between inflation and unemployment exists, but it cannot be utilized by the monetary policy for countercyclical purposes.|$|R

Furthermore, the estimation results reveal the unidirectional Granger causality from the real GDP growth rate to the countercyclical monetary policy, i. e., the real GDP growth rate is weakly exogenous from the Bangladeshi <b>countercyclical</b> monetary policy <b>actions.</b> These find-ings indicate {{that even though the}} Bangladeshi Central Bank uses its monetary policy to man-age the macro economy, money and hence monetary policy seem not to matter in the short run...|$|R
40|$|European {{debates over}} {{reform of the}} fiscal {{governance}} of the euro area frequently reference fiscal federalism in the United States. The "fiscal compact" agreed by the European Council during 2011 provided for the introduction of, among other things, constitutional rules or framework laws known as "debt brakes" in the member states of the euro area. In light of the compact and proposals for deeper fiscal union, we review US fiscal federalism from Alexander Hamilton to the present. We note that within the US system the states are "sovereign": The federal government does not mandate balanced budgets nor, since the 1840 s, does it bail out states in fiscal trouble. States adopted balanced budget rules of varying strength {{during the nineteenth century}} and these rules limit debt accumulation. Before introducing debt brakes for euro area member states, however, Europeans should consider three important caveats. First, debt brakes {{are likely to be more}} durable and effective when "owned" locally rather than mandated centrally. Second, maintaining a capacity for countercyclical macroeconomic stabilization is essential. Balanced budget rules have been viable in the US states because the federal government has a broad set of fiscal powers, including <b>countercyclical</b> fiscal <b>action.</b> Finally, because debt brakes threaten to collide with bank rescues, the euro area should unify bank regulation and create a common fiscal pool for restructuring the banking system. fiscal federalism, balanced budget rules, US financial history, state debt, euro crisis, fiscal compact...|$|R
40|$|President Barack Obama {{noted that}} fiscal {{stimulus}} polices should follow three T’s—timely, targeted, and temporary. This paper examines the government’s fiscal response to eleven postwar recessions {{in light of}} the three T’s. We find that the record is mixed at best. On average it took 10. 9 months before a recession’s start and the first major <b>countercyclical</b> fiscal policy <b>action.</b> Additionally, in half of the eight recessions in which fiscal policy was attempted, the level of real per capita government spending was nearly three times its trend level four years after the recession was over—i. e. the stimulus was not temporary. Finally, with respect to targeted, while some countercyclical policies have been designed to help sectors that were particularly harmed during a recession, we find many cases whereby recessions provided politicians an avenue in which to implement policies that were part of their long-run reform agenda rather than being carefully targeted countercyclical fiscal policy...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} recessions and recoveries {{in advanced}} economies {{and the role}} of countercyclical macroeconomic policies. Are recessions and recoveries associated with financial crises different from others? What are the main features of globally synchronized recessions? Can countercylical policies help shorten recessions and strengthen recoveries? The results suggest that recessions associated with financial crises tend to be unusually severe and their recoveries typically slow. Similarly, globally synchronized recessions are often long and deep, and recoveries from these recessions are generally weak. Countercyclical monetary policy can help shorten recessions, but its effectiveness is limited in financial crises. By contrast, expansionary fiscal policy seems particularly effective in shortening recessions associated with financial crises and boosting recoveries. However, its effectiveness is a decreasing function of the level of public debt. These findings suggest the current recession is likely to be unusually long and severe and the recovery sluggish. However, strong <b>countercyclical</b> policy <b>action,</b> combined with the restoration of confidence in the financial sector, could help move the recovery forward. The global economy is experiencing the deepest downturn in the post–World War II period, as the financial crisis rapidly spreads around the world (see Chapters 1 and 2). A large number of advanced economies have fallen into recession, and economies {{in the rest of the}} world have slowed abruptly. Global trade and financial flows are shrinking, while output and employment losses mount. Credit markets remain frozen as borrowers are engaged in a drawn-out deleveraging process and banks struggle to improve their financial health. Note: The main authors of this chapter are Marc...|$|R
40|$|Mr. President. I wish {{to thank}} you and the Economic, Promotion and Development Commission of the Honorable Chamber of Representatives for {{inviting}} me to speak about how our monetary policy decisions affect the country’s financial and lending conditions. The global economy is enduring terribly uncertain times, which have implications on our country’s prospects for growth and inflation. Thus, we share your preoccupation for evaluating how monetary policy actions – {{one of the main}} stabilizing tools we have available as a country – ultimately affect the cost of borrowing faced by households and firms. Monetary policy, {{in the context of an}} inflation target and a floating exchange rate like the one operating in Chile since 1999, is an important mechanism for smoothing out the business cycle. Periods of weak output and demand performance, which reduce the medium-term inflation outlook, lend themselves to <b>countercyclical</b> monetary policy <b>actions</b> that cushion the negative effects on consumption, investment and employment. This is what the Central Bank of Chile is presently doing, acting resolutely to moderate the effects that the global crisis – the worst we have seen in decades – is having in Chile.
