5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian <b>cause</b> <b>if</b> he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E
5|$|Later {{chapters}} {{provide evidence}} that evolution has occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under the alternate concept that species had been individually created. The structure of Darwin's argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a vera causa (true <b>cause)</b> <b>if</b> three things could be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, {{and its ability to}} explain a wide range of observations.|$|E

25|$|The {{alterations}} {{in the sense}} of taste, usually a metallic taste, and sometimes smell are the only symptoms. The duration of the symptoms of dysgeusia depends on the <b>cause.</b> <b>If</b> the alteration {{in the sense of}} taste is due to gum disease, dental plaque, a temporary medication, or a short-term condition such as a cold, the dysgeusia should disappear once the cause is removed. In some cases, if lesions are present in the taste pathway and nerves have been damaged, the dysgeusia may be permanent.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes insipidus* in dogs can be central, {{caused by}} a lack of {{antidiuretic}} hormone (ADH), or nephrogenic, {{caused by a}} lack of response of the kidneys to ADH. Neither form is common. Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is usually idiopathic, but can also be caused by head trauma or tumors of the brain. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) can be primary (hereditary) or secondary (caused by a variety of metabolic and renal diseases, including Cushing's syndrome and pyometra). Because the disease is characterized by an inability to concentrate urine, the most common sign is increased drinking and urinating. Treatment of CDI is to use desmopressin, a synthetic analog of ADH. Treatment of NDI is to treat the underlying <b>cause,</b> <b>if</b> any.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between the couple appears at times to have been almost that of a mother and child. Rosebery, a self-centred, reserved man, prone to depression, pessimism and insecurity, had a difficult relationship with his mother who had been distant and openly preferred his younger brother. Lady Rosebery, an orphan and only child, {{appears to have been}} desperate to lavish affection. Once upon entering a book shop she told her children they were entering a toy shop, and when the disappointed children pointed out the obvious she replied [...] "to your father this is a toy shop." [...] Lord Rosebery's friend Edward Hamilton recorded her [...] "notable faculty of getting other people to work and quickening their energies." [...] It seems she was the driving force of the relationship, with her feet firmly on the ground. She made herself the link between the world and her [...] "thin skinned and neurotic" [...] husband. While her husband sulked or withdrew with hurt pride from a situation, she came to the forefront to plead his case or <b>cause.</b> <b>If</b> she was aware of his faults she gave no indication of it.|$|E

2500|$|One {{explanation}} {{is that it was}} established during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715. The Jacobites declared that the natives of Newcastle were staunch supporters of the Hanoverian kings, in particular of George I during the 1715 rebellion.

2500|$|Roy Wilkins {{announced}} that W. E. B. Du Bois {{had died in}} Ghana the previous night; the crowd observed {{a moment of silence}} in his memory. Wilkins had initially refused to announce the news because he despised Du Bois as a Communist—but then insisted on making the announcement when he realized that Randolph would make it if he didn't. Wilkins said: [...] "Regardless of the fact that in his later years Dr. Du Bois chose another path, it is incontrovertible that {{at the dawn of the}} twentieth century his was the voice that was calling you to gather here today in this <b>cause.</b> <b>If</b> you want to read something that applies to 1963 go back and get a volume of The Souls of Black Folk by Du Bois, published in 1903." ...|$|E
2500|$|Desmopressin will be {{ineffective}} in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing the underlying <b>cause</b> (<b>if</b> possible) and replacing the free water deficit. The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) or indomethacin {{can be used}} to create mild hypovolemia which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Amiloride has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent hypokalemia. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis. [...] This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the glomerular filtration rate and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. [...] Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnoses {{of wheat}} allergy may deserve special consideration. [...] Omega-5 gliadin, {{the most potent}} wheat allergen, cannot be {{detected}} in whole wheat preparations; it must be extracted and partially digested (similar to how it degrades in the intestine) to reach full activity. Other studies show that digestion of wheat proteins to about 10 amino acids can increase the allergic response 10 fold. Certain allergy tests may not be suitable to detect all wheat allergies, resulting in cryptic allergies. [...] Because many of the symptoms associated with wheat allergies, such as sacroiliitis, eczema and asthma, may be related or unrelated to a wheat allergy, medical deduction {{can be an effective}} way of determining the <b>cause.</b> <b>If</b> symptoms are alleviated by immunosuppressant drugs, such as Prednisone, an allergy-related cause is likely. [...] If multiple symptoms associated with wheat allergies are present in the absence of immunosuppressants then a wheat allergy is probable.|$|E
2500|$|However, legal {{scholars}} {{have attempted to}} make further inroads into what explains these difficult cases. [...] Some scholars have proposed a test of sufficiency instead of a test of necessity. [...] H. L. A. Hart and Tony Honoré, and later Richard Wright, have said that something is a <b>cause</b> <b>if</b> it is a ‘necessary element {{of a set of}} conditions jointly sufficient for the result’. [...] This is known as the NESS test. [...] In the case of the two hunters, the set of conditions required to bring about the result of the victim's injury would include a gunshot to the eye, the victim being {{in the right place at}} the right time, gravity, etc. [...] In such a set, either of the hunters' shots would be a member, and hence a cause. [...] This arguably gives us a more theoretically satisfying reason to conclude that something was a cause of something else than by appealing to notions of intuition or common sense.|$|E
2500|$|Philosopher Peter Singer of Princeton University {{has argued}} that ALF direct action can only be {{regarded}} as a just <b>cause</b> <b>if</b> it is non-violent, and that the ALF is at its most effective when uncovering evidence of animal abuse that other tactics could not expose. He cites 1984's [...] "Unnecessary Fuss" [...] campaign, when ALF raided the University of Pennsylvania's head-injury research clinic and removed footage showing researchers laughing at the brain damage of conscious baboons, as an example. The university responded that the treatment of the animals conformed to National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines, but {{as a result of the}} publicity, the lab was closed down, the chief veterinarian fired, and the university placed on probation. Barbara Orlans, a former animal researcher with the NIH, now with the Kennedy Institute of Ethics, writes that the case stunned the biomedical community, and is today considered one of the most significant cases in the ethics of using animals in research. Singer argues that if the ALF would focus on this kind of direct action, instead of sabotage, it would appeal to the minds of reasonable people. Against this, Steven Best writes that industries and governments have too much institutional and financial bias for reason to prevail.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper has}} two goals : first {{to present the}} {{computer}} graphics community's {{point of view on}} virtual reality, and next to describe some of the works realized by French computer graphics teams. We think that {{the point of view of}} the teams working in computer graphics is interesting because these teams have a particular knowledge of the possibilities and the limits of computers, in terms of computation but also in terms of visualization. Thus the recent breakthroughs in virtual reality were often realized by laboratories working on computer graphics. 1 Introduction The term virtual reality designates the set of activities in which a part of the world upon which man acts, is replaced by a calculated module. The interest of virtual reality is to enable sensorial contact with an inaccessible world.
