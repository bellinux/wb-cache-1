40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the theory that}} language comprehension involves analyzing sentences into phonological structures, syntactic structures, and semantic structures. The interaction between the three levels of linguistic representation accounts for four stages of parsing: (a) &phis;-phrasing (i. e., combining words into phonological phrases), (b) attachment (i. e., attaching a phrase to an existing structure), (c) thematic interpretation (i. e., interpreting thematic relations), and (d) clausal analysis (i. e., processing a sentence <b>clause</b> <b>by</b> <b>clause).</b> Syntactic ambiguities are resolved through the four stages of parsing. This theory explains why some locally ambiguous sentences cause garden path effects whereas others do not and why some globally ambiguous sentences cause pun effects whereas others do not...|$|R

50|$|A further notable change {{took place}} at the same time. The Mutiny Act had been brought into force on each {{occasion}} for one year only, in compliance with the constitutional theory:that the maintenance of a standing army in time of peace, unless with the consent of parliament, is against law. Each session therefore the text of the act had to be passed through both Houses <b>clause</b> <b>by</b> <b>clause</b> and line <b>by</b> line. The Army Act, on the other hand, is a fixed permanent code. But constitutional traditions are fully respected by the insertion in it of a section providing that it shall come into force only by virtue of an annual act of parliament. This annual act recites the illegality of a standing army in time of peace unless with the consent of parliament, and the necessity nevertheless of maintaining a certain number of land forces (exclusive of those serving in India) and a body of royal marine forces on shore, and of keeping them in exact discipline, and it brings into force the Army Act for one year.|$|R

40|$|I {{would like}} to {{challenge}} the conventional way twentieth-century lawyers and legal academics have tended to think about, write about {{and talk about the}} Bill of Rights. First, a methodological point. Twentieth-century academics and lawyers tend to focus on individual clauses in doing their scholarship and in talking about the Bill of Rights.

5|$|By {{the time}} the Richmond {{convention}} opened, Randolph had abandoned the Anti-Federalist cause, which damaged efforts by Mason and Henry to co-ordinate with their counterparts in New York. Mason moved that the convention consider the document <b>clause</b> <b>by</b> <b>clause,</b> which may have played {{into the hands of}} the Federalists, who feared what the outcome of an immediate vote might be, and who had more able leadership in Richmond, including Marshall and Madison. Nevertheless, Broadwater suggested that as most delegates had declared their views before the election, Mason's motion made little difference. Henry, far more a foe of a strong federal government than was Mason, took the lead for his side in the debate. Mason spoke several times in the discussion, on topics ranging from the pardon power (which he predicted the president would use corruptly) to the federal judiciary, which he warned would lead to suits in the federal courts by citizens against states where they did not live. John Marshall, a future Chief Justice of the United States, downplayed the concern regarding the judiciary, but Mason would later be proved correct in the case of Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), which led to the passage of the Eleventh Amendment.|$|R
60|$|The houses then separated, {{and each}} {{commenced}} its own deliberations. But, instead of promptly {{complying with the}} king's proposals they sent him a petition for redress of {{a long list of}} what they called grievances. These grievances were, almost all of them, complaints of the toleration and encouragement of the Catholics, through the influence of the king's Catholic bride. She had stipulated to have a Catholic chapel, and Catholic attendants, and, after her arrival in England, she and Buckingham had so much influence over the king, that they were producing quite a change at court, and gradually through all ranks of society, in favor of the Catholics. The Commons complained of a great many things, nearly all, however, originating in this cause. The king answered these complaints, <b>clause</b> <b>by</b> <b>clause,</b> promising redress more or less distinctly. There is not room to give this petition and the answers in full, but as all the subsequent troubles between Charles and the people of England arose out of this difficulty of his young wife's bringing in so strong a Catholic influence with her to the realm, it may be well to give an abstract of some of the principal petitions, with the king's answers.|$|R
40|$|With {{more than}} 120 {{years of history}} and well {{consolidated}} status and power especially after the World War II, Japan’s national Diet may still be regarded as rather poor ‘supreme’ organ. This paper aims to clarify the characteristics of actual mechanism of Japan’s Diet {{in terms of both}} institutional settings and facts about legislative activities by making comparison both with French national parliament and Kochi prefectural parliament. The arguments of this paper can be summarized in three points. Firstly, in both national Diet and Kochi parliament, the activities and functions of plenary sessions have become extremely weak. One especially salient fact is the total lack of <b>clause</b> <b>by</b> <b>clause</b> type of legislative deliberations, which are the universal norm of western democracies including France. Second argument is that in Japan’s two cases question-and-answer style is almost the only pattern within the legislative procedures, and discussions between parliamentarians are lacking, which in French case are normally carried out through amendment activities. Finally, despite the similarities, Japan’s national Diet has one very significant characteristics unseen in local parliament. The Diet is a sort of ‘negotiating system’, which needs almost perpetual negotiations in order to manage itself including legislative procedures. This is impressively different from a sort of ‘prefixed system’ of local parliament...|$|R
