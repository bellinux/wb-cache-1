500|$|Game {{planning}} {{began in}} summer 2004. Initially, about six developers {{started with a}} [...] "clean slate" [...] to conceptualize a new Star Wars game; {{the small group of}} engineers, artists, and designers spent more than a year brainstorming ideas for what might make a good game. Over 100 initial concepts were whittled down to 20 to 25 that included making the game the third entry in the [...] series or having the protagonist be a Wookiee [...] "superhero", Darth Maul, a bounty hunter, a smuggler, a mercenary, or the last member of the Skywalker family. The decision to focus on the largely unexplored period between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope helped energize the design team. <b>Consumer</b> <b>feedback</b> helped the developers narrow in on seven concepts, and elements from those seven went into The Force Unleasheds overall concept.|$|E
500|$|For Ivar Lødemel and Heather Trickey, {{editors of}} An Offer You Can't Refuse': Workfare in International Perspective, {{workfare}} programmes' reliance on compulsion makes them throffers. Citing the Danish model as a particular example, the pair argue that workfare {{involves the use}} of compulsory offers; while the work or education is presented as an offer, because recipients of welfare are dependent upon the help they would lose if they refuse the offer, they effectively have no choice. The compulsive aspect reveals that at least some recipients of welfare, in the eyes of policy makers, require coercion before they will accept offers of work. Neither the chance of paid work nor participation in labour schemes are, alone, enough to encourage some to freely accept the offers they receive. Such compulsion serves to reintegrate people into the labour market, and serves as a kind of [...] "new paternalism". The authors are concerned about this compulsion, and present several arguments against it which are possible or have been utilised in the literature: Firstly, it impacts the rights of those against whom it is used. This may make it objectionable in and of itself, or it may result in undesirable outcomes. Secondly, {{it can be argued that}} benefits must be unconditional in order to act as a genuine safety net. Thirdly, compulsion undermines <b>consumer</b> <b>feedback,</b> and so no differentiation can be made between good and poor programmes presented to those receiving welfare. Fourthly, such coercion may contribute to a culture of resistance among those receiving welfare.|$|E

There is overwhelming evidence corroborating the idea that industry needs to understand the model before rely on it. Choosing the best farms to contract production is a critical decision in order to design an efficient model to select suppliers and explore alternative solutions by purchase managers. This position allow the manager to gain knowledge about the range of prices he can fix on contracts considering the uncertainty represented by each scenario. Moreover, decisions makers are able to use the huge amount of big data gathered from their industrial context to feed the model with accurate coefficients for csv and cgv and enlarging the number of scenarios to be considered. Historical data sets for past seasons, <b>consumers</b> <b>feedback,</b> traceability, transport cost, among others, can be used to model these input parameters. Furthermore, the stochasticity of the model introduces the market uncertainty and makes possible to improve predictions about the future trends so as to make better decisions in the whole agri-food business context.|$|R

40|$|Some service {{reputation}} approaches primarily {{consider the}} consumer's prior {{experience of the}} service via opinion feedback system, may neglect the effect of Trust Transition (TT) in the recommendations of others. The service reputation is propagated via referral network recommendations for service composition and eventually builds a distinct level of consumer trust in the service. Accordingly, the present study proposes a service selection model in which the reputation of a sea-ice provider is estimated by collecting <b>consumer</b> <b>feedbacks</b> and other's recommendations in open networks. The degree of service reputation is appropriately estimated using fuzzy Petri net (FPN) to model the referral activities across the social networks and outrank a set of service alternatives using the global reputation score of a service. Two examples of social services selection are used to demonstrate the proposed approach. The proposed model effectively solves the trust transition problem in the indirect recommendation of the service selection and also enables deception detection in terms of existing evidences for assessment of evaluator credibility that excludes the false evidences of dishonest evaluators...|$|R
