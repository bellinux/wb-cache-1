Establishes {{specified}} {{limits on}} contributions and loans {{that can be}} made or accepted for campaigns for state legislative offices. Establishes Campaign Reform Fund to which individual taxpayers may designate for deposit up to $ 3 annually from income taxes paid. Provides legislative candidates who receive specified threshold contributions from other sources, and meet additional requirements, may receive with limitation matching campaign funds from Campaign Reform Fund. Establishes specific campaign expenditure limits for candidates accepting funds from Campaign Reform Fund. Provides civil and criminal penalties for violations. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: State income tax revenues would be reduced by about $ 11. 6 million in 1986 - 87, and by a net of about $ 10 million in each subsequent fiscal year. The checkoff revenues would be transferred to the Campaign Reform Fund. An unknown portion of these funds may not be spent and will revert to the General Fund after each subsequent general election. State administrative costs would increase by about $ 500, 000 in 1986 - 87, and grow to about $ 800, 000 by 1988 - 89. The Franchise Tax Board would incur a one-time cost of about $ 1. 6 million in 1986 - 87 to print a second set of 1986 income tax forms to include the new <b>checkoff</b> <b>provision...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{enactment}} in June 2011 of Wisconsin Act 10, {{legislation that}} eliminated most collective bargaining rights for most public employees in Wisconsin, {{did not necessarily}} follow from the economic conditions surrounding the global recession. The argument {{here is that it}} was a blatant power grab with political, social, and economic implications. Governor Walker’s claim that Act 10 ’s anti-collective bargaining approach was required to balance Wisconsin’s budget is belied by two unassailable facts. First, {{there were a number of}} provisions in the law, including an annual union recertification requirement and an anti-dues <b>checkoff</b> <b>provision,</b> which had absolutely nothing to do with cost savings. Perhaps even more tellingly, when Act 10 was finally enacted by the State legislature, Walker and his allies in the legislature employed a legislative procedure which could only be utilized if Act 10 did not have any impact on state fiscal policy. In short, Governor Walker used the global economic crisis, and Wisconsin’s budget situation more specifically, as a ruse to enact a punitive bill against public sector unions. Although unions and their allies have drafted, and continue to draft, procedural and substantive legal challenges to Act 10 based on state open meeting laws and constitutionally-based freedom of speech and equal protections provisions, these legal challenges have been largely limited in their success. Unless Act 10 is repealed, it indeed may be a long time before any real public sector collective bargaining will be permitted in Wisconsin. The subsequent loss of workplace rights not only adversely impacts public sector workers, but also the citizens of Wisconsin who will be that much poorer for having to live in a society where internationally-recognized rights of association and collective bargaining are not taken seriously...|$|E

As a precaution, many states began forming voluntary beef checkoffs, where funds would be raised through voluntary contributions. This study conducted a survey of Oklahoma cattle producers to determine what type ofvoluntary checkoff design would receive the greatest support. The most popular checkoff placed a large emphasis on advertising and a slightly lower checkoff fee. The survey also tested {{the ability of a}} provision point mechanism to limit free-riding. The mechanism was not as effective as in other studies which used laboratory experiments. beef marketing, <b>checkoff,</b> free-rider, <b>provision</b> point mechanism, public good, Agricultural and Food Policy, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
