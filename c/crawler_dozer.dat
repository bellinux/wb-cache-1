5000|$|... 1983 - {{launched}} Europe's largest tractor, {{designed to}} work as a <b>crawler</b> <b>dozer,</b> T-800 full weight of 106 tons (without blade length - 7945 mm, with blade -12 400 mm, width without blade -4185 mm, Width -6000 mm blade height -4775 mm.).|$|E
30|$|Quantities of {{bacteria}} and actinomycetes in plots compacted by <b>crawler</b> <b>dozer</b> {{are more than}} those compacted by dump truck, and the quantity of fungi is just the opposite. But overall, the total quantity of microorganism in the plots compacted by <b>crawler</b> <b>dozer</b> is more than those compacted by dump truck. With the increase of compaction times, the quantity of microorganisms increases firstly and then decreases just like an inverted “V”. The quantity reaches the peak when the plot is compacted three times by dump truck or five times by <b>crawler</b> <b>dozer,</b> and at this time, the quantity of microorganisms is nearest to the natural soil.|$|E
30|$|It {{is similar}} to {{microorganisms}} that {{with the increase of}} compaction times, the change of the soil respiratory capacity presents an inverted “V”. Its amount reaches the peak when compacting three times; and the soil respiratory capacity in the plot compacted by <b>crawler</b> <b>dozer</b> is larger than those compacted by dump truck.|$|E

5000|$|As of May 2017, {{according}} to Trade Arabia, Case [...] "sells a full line of construction equipment around the world, including {{the number one}} loader/backhoes, excavators, motor graders, wheel loaders, vibratory compaction rollers, <b>crawler</b> <b>dozers,</b> skid steers, compact track loaders and rough-terrain forklifts." ...|$|R

[...] Case produces construction equipment including excavators, motor graders, wheel loaders, vibratory compaction rollers, <b>crawler</b> <b>dozers,</b> skid steers, and compact track loaders.|$|R
30|$|In general, we can {{see from}} Table  1, that the {{microbial}} quantity size order is bacteria > actinomycetes > fungi, {{no matter how many}} times construction machineries compact; in addition, the soil microbial number of experimental plots and the total number of microorganism are all below the contrast level (except for <b>crawler</b> <b>dozer,</b> three times compaction), and this is because that compared with natural sinking soil, mechanical compaction can increase soil bulk density, which affects the water and air permeability, porosity and root penetrative resistance, thereby can impact the growth and development of root system. These cases will affect nutritional source of the soil microorganism additionally to some extent. On the other hand, for the aerobic saprophytic microorganism in the soil, the compacted soil cannot provide enough oxygen for them, and all of these factors affect the microbial activity indirectly (Wang et al. 2009 b).|$|E
30|$|According to {{the soil}} {{respiratory}} capacities under different compaction machineries, the averages of soil respiratory capacities from the plot that compacted by dump truck and <b>crawler</b> <b>dozer</b> are 30.478  mg CO 2 / 100  g soil and 52.232  mg CO 2 / 100  g soil respectively, and the comparison of soil respiration intensity is crawler dozer > dump truck, which is caused by physical and biological factors. On one hand, the compaction degrees of the plot that compacted by dump truck are bigger, which makes the soil permeability worse, and goes against the exhaust of CO 2; on the other hand, the bigger compaction degrees cause the larger soil bulk density, which hinders the rooting of plants {{and the growth of}} microorganisms, makes the autotrophic respiration of plant roots and the heterotrophic respiration microorganisms weak, and results in less soil respiration.|$|E
30|$|In addition, the {{microbial}} quantities are different when using different construction machineries to compact; for the bacteria and actinomycetes, the quantitative size order is: crawler dozer > dump truck. When using {{two kinds of}} machineries to compact at the same time, the dump truck makes a bigger soil compaction degree, so the plots that using dump truck to compact have a bigger soil bulk density, worse soil permeability and stronger root penetrative resistance, and thus these cases hinder the growth of bacteria and actinomycetes, expressing the less quantities of the bacteria and actinomycetes. For the fungi, the quantitative size order is: dump truck > crawler dozer, which is because for the plots that compacted by dump truck, {{the growth of the}} bacteria and actinomycetes are hindered, so the fungi acquires more nutrition and bigger living space, and at this time, the effect of soil bulk density is not significant, thus the quantity of the fungi from the plot that compacted by dump truck is higher than that from the plot compacted by <b>crawler</b> <b>dozer</b> slightly.|$|E
