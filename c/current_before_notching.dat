50|$|Due to {{a series}} of {{injuries}} that plagued the team {{at the start of the}} season together with the recently concluded Governors' Cup Finals that gave them barely a week to prepare for the Philippine Cup, the Super Coffee Mixers struggled to get back to championship form.

Although their final game against the E-Painters held on December 29, 2013 resulted in a 77-101 beating, this proved to be a wake-up call for them as they would end up sweeping their remaining four games against powerhouse teams.|$|R
