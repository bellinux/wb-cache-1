500|$|As the Japanese fleet moved in, the Chinese fleet {{moved away}} from anchor and {{attempted}} for form up in a line. However, the manoeuvre was botched and Chaoyong {{was one of four}} ships which ended up behind the others. This was {{due to a lack of}} maintenance over the years; with their equipment out of date, they <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> [...] Orders had been given for the ships to operate in pairs, with Chaoyong and Yangwei teamed together. This battle plan was alien to the premise of their design, inherent in the lack of armour for ships about to fight in the line of battle.|$|E
500|$|Later on {{the first}} day of the battle, the hard-pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British opponents. Schlesien and the other {{so-called}} [...] "five-minute ships" [...] came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. Schlesien and her sisters <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> out a target in the darkness. Due to the poor visibility their shooting was ineffective. The British battlecruisers scored several hits on the German ships; in the brief melee a near miss from a large-caliber gun sprayed shell splinters onto Schlesiens decks, killing one man and wounding another. Admiral Mauve ordered an 8-point turn to the south, and the British did not follow.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the action}} Tripoli was {{severely}} damaged; 30of her crew were dead and another 30were injured. The polacca's first lieutenant was among the casualties and Admiral Rous himself was injured in the fighting. In what amounted to a total American victory over the Tripolitans, Enterprise had suffered only superficial damage and no casualties. [...] Sterett, whose orders did not give him the authority to retain prizes, let the polacca limp back to Tripoli. However, before setting her free, the Americans cut down Tripoli masts and sufficiently disabled her so that she <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> sail. Sterett then continued his journey to Malta and picked up the supplies for which he was sent before returning to the blockade.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{in spite}} of her happiness, Laura's health {{continued}} to deteriorate rapidly and the only possible way to save her life was with a heart transplant. In the nick of time, Leo learned that friend Gillian Lavery {{had been shot in the}} head, and managed to convince her grieving husband Ryan to donate Gillian's heart to Laura. Laura rapidly recovered, but was quite needy. Leo almost immediately realized that as much as he wanted to, he did not love Laura. Leo loved only Greenlee, and he <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> even <b>make</b> love to his wife. Laura began to go insane, plotted against Greenlee, and ultimately guilted Leo into a [...] "proper" [...] ceremony, which was stopped only because Greenlee set off the sprinkler system. Leo took the downpour as symbolic, and cut all ties with Laura. Within a few months, she left town to get therapy, and Leo and Greenlee happily reunited.|$|R

They had a farm of {{less than a hundred}} acres, and <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>barely</b> a living on it. Then the oil prospectors came along and located a well or two, and now those poor farm people have so much money they don't {{know what to do with}} it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ullman, who {{had been}} living an upper-middle class life, was uprooted to Hackbridge, {{southwest}} London, along with her older sister Patti and her mother, who <b>could</b> now <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> ends meet without their father's income. [...] "After Dad died, our fortunes came and went because Mum couldn’t speak Polish and {{had to give up}} the business." [...] Mother Dorin would go on to take a host of odd jobs. [...] "My mother was always doing strange things like driving parts around for a garage, all covered in oil and paid 10 pounds a week. But she was very funny, and our defence against hardship was having a great sense of humour." [...] On a separate occasion, on the subject of her mother's jobs, Ullman recalled: [...] "Mum worked in a laboratory, testing food, and would bring home samples for our dinner. Sometimes she'd have to report that formula X had been found unfit for human consumption." [...] Despite reality, their mother maintained that they were middle-class. [...] "My mother always insisted on middle-class because we had money at one time. We're really lower-middle." ...|$|R
2500|$|At this time, {{the main}} engines of Louisiana had been installed, but {{those for the}} screws, needed for steering, had not. Furthermore, the main engines {{were found to be}} inadequate; even at dangerously high boiler pressure, she <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> headway against the river current. Unable to move on her own, she had to be towed down to the forts, with workmen still aboard. [...] There she was tied to the left bank (here, {{the north side of the}} river) a short {{distance}} above Fort St. Philip. This did not completely mollify General Duncan, who wanted the ship to be positioned below the forts, but Commander Whittle would not risk his vessel, with unarmored deck, against the plunging fire of the Union mortars. She remained at this position throughout the ensuing battle.|$|E
60|$|Wyllard <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> out the schooner, {{which had}} {{apparently}} followed them, {{a blur of}} dusky canvas against a bank of haze, and then as the boat slid down into a hollow {{there was nothing but}} the low-hung, lowering sky. It was evident to him that if they were to make a landing it must be done promptly.|$|E
6000|$|The Black Shadows crept far {{across the}} Green Meadows {{and it became}} so dusky in the Green Forest that Peter <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> out the sweet singer above his head. Still Melody sang on and the hush of eventide grew deeper, {{as if all the}} Great World were holding its breath to listen. It was not until several little stars had begun to twinkle high up in the sky that Melody stopped singing and sought the safety of his hidden perch for the night. Peter felt sure that somewhere near was a nest and that one thing which had made that song so {{beautiful}} was the love Melody lad been trying to express to the little mate sitting on the eggs that nest must contain. [...] "I'll just run over here early in the morning," [...] thought Peter.|$|E
60|$|The side of {{the ship}} made an opaque belt of shadow on the darkling glassy shimmer of the sea. But I saw at once {{something}} elongated and pale floating very close to the ladder. Before I could form a guess a faint flash of phosphorescent light, which seemed to issue suddenly from the naked body of a man, flickered in the sleeping water with the elusive, silent play of summer lightning in a night sky. With a gasp I saw revealed to my stare a pair of feet, the long legs, a broad livid back immersed right up to the neck in a greenish cadaverous glow. One hand, awash, clutched the bottom rung of the ladder. He was complete but for the head. A headless corpse! The cigar dropped out of my gaping mouth with a tiny plop and a short hiss quite audible in the absolute stillness of all things under heaven. At that I suppose he raised up his face, a dimly pale oval {{in the shadow of the}} ship's side. But even then I <b>could</b> only <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> out down there the shape of his black-haired head. However, it was enough for the horrid, frost-bound sensation which had gripped me about the chest to pass off. The moment of vain exclamations was past, too. I only climbed on the spare spar and leaned over the rail as far as I could, to bring my eyes nearer to that mystery floating alongside.|$|R

60|$|The two men passed on. The room {{in which}} they found {{themselves}} was a small one and there were not more than fifty people present. It was very dimly lit and they <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> out the forms of the row of men who were sitting upon chairs upon the platform. They contented themselves with seats quite close to the door. No drinks were being served here. Although one or two men were smoking, the general aspect seemed {{to be one of}} stern and serious intensity. A man upon the platform was just finishing speaking as they entered, and he apparently called upon some one else. A large and heavy German stood up on the centre of the slightly raised stage. He wore shapeless clothes and horn-rimmed spectacles. His face was benevolent. He had a double chin and a soft voice.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{not long}} before I {{discovered}} that her suspicions were well founded, and that this man from Archangel was still lurking in the vicinity. Being restless one night I rose and peered out of the window. The weather was somewhat cloudy, and I <b>could</b> <b>barely</b> <b>make</b> out the line of the sea, and the loom of my boat upon the beach. As I gazed, however, and my eyes became accustomed to the obscurity, I became aware that there was some other dark blur upon the sands, and that in front of my very door, where certainly there had been nothing of the sort the preceding night. As I stood at my diamond-paned lattice still peering and peeping to make out what this might be, a great bank of clouds rolled slowly away {{from the face of the}} moon, and a flood of cold, clear light was poured down upon the silent bay and the long sweep of its desolate shores. Then I saw what this was which haunted my doorstep. It was he, the Russian. He squatted there like a gigantic toad, with his legs doubled under him in strange Mongolian fashion, and his eyes fixed apparently upon the window of the room in which the young girl and the housekeeper slept. The light fell upon his upturned face, and I saw once more the hawk-like grace of his countenance, with the single deeply-indented line of care upon his brow, and the protruding beard which marks the passionate nature. My first impulse was to shoot him as a trespasser, but, as I gazed, my resentment changed into pity and contempt. [...] "Poor fool," [...] I said to myself, [...] "is it then possible that you, whom I have seen looking open-eyed at present death, should have your whole thoughts and ambition centred upon this wretched slip of a girl--a girl, too, who flies from you and hates you. Most women would love you--were it but for that dark face and great handsome body of yours--and yet you must needs hanker after the one in a thousand who will have no traffic with you." [...] As I returned to my bed I chuckled much to myself over this thought. I knew that my bars were strong and my bolts thick. It mattered little to me whether this strange man spent his night at my door or a hundred leagues off, so long as he was gone by the morning. As I expected, when I rose and went out there was no sign of him, nor had he left any trace of his midnight vigil.|$|E
