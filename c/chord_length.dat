5|$|The trainer {{version of}} the AV-8B is the TAV-8B, seating two pilots in tandem. Among other changes, the forward {{fuselage}} features a 3ft 11in (1.19m) extension to accommodate the second cockpit. To compensate for the slight loss of directional stability, the vertical stabilizer's area was enlarged through increases in <b>chord</b> (<b>length</b> of the stabilizer's root) and height. USMC TAV-8Bs feature the AV-8B's digital cockpit and new systems, but have only two hardpoints and are not combat capable. Initial TAV-8Bs were powered by a 21,450lbf (95.4kN) F402-RR-406A engine, while later examples were fitted with the 23,000lbf (105.8kN) F402-RR-408A. In the early 2000s, 17 TAV-8Bs were upgraded to include a night-attack capability, the F402-RR-408 engine, and software and structural changes.|$|E

Four similar type interplane struts were used between the upper three wings, {{all of which}} had ailerons. The bottom wing had a shorter span with pairs of struts and cut outs for the landing gear wheels. Because the axle was the same height as the lower wing, the tailskid was very tall to prevent that wings trailing edge from contacting the ground.

For the F-R configuration, spanwise deformation of the leading-flexible wing shifted the impingement point of the trailing-edge shear layer on the trailing-wing thus affecting lift generation. Deformation measurements showed {{that the presence of}} the rigid-trailing-wing had a profound influence on the flow-induced vibrations of the leading-flexible-wing, peaking at a crosswise separation of 0. 32 <b>chord</b> <b>lengths</b> which also provided the largest unsteady forces. Velocity spectra measurements revealed that cases producing increased unsteady forces possessed distinct inter-wing velocity fluctuations which were coupled with the wing vibrations.

500|$|The wing {{shape of}} Pteranodon {{suggests}} {{that it would have}} flown rather like a modern-day albatross.

While most of a Pteranodon flight would have depended on soaring, like long-winged seabirds, it probably required an occasional active, rapid burst of flapping, and studies of Pteranodon wing loading (the strength of the wings vs. the weight of the body) indicate that they were capable of substantial flapping flight, contrary to some earlier suggestions that they were so big they could only glide.|$|E
