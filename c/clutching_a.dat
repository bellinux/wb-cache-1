He {{was shot and}} later found dead, <b>clutching</b> <b>a</b> picture of the Virgin Mary. As a warning to others, his body was exhumed and {{subsequently}} decapitated, his head exhibited outside Parliament.|$|E
5|$|A local landmark, the Fremont Troll—a large cement {{sculpture}} of a troll <b>clutching</b> <b>a</b> real-life Volkswagen Beetle—was installed under the bridge's north end in 1990. Up to half of the $40,000 cost for the artwork was donated from Seattle's Neighborhood Matching Fund, a local program {{to raise money for}} community projects. The sculpture was heavily vandalized in the year following its construction and large floodlights were installed on the bridge to discourage further damage.|$|E

5|$|Solar deities play a {{major role}} in many world {{religions}} and mythologies. The ancient Sumerians believed that the sun was Utu, the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, who was identified as the planet Venus. Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash. Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress, and, in iconography, he is usually portrayed with a long beard and <b>clutching</b> <b>a</b> saw, which represented his role as the dispenser of justice.|$|E
5|$|Unable to find Bruckman in the hotel, Mulder and Scully {{return to}} Bruckman's {{apartment}} {{to find that}} Bruckman has committed suicide; Scully sees a plastic bag has been tied around his head, {{and that he is}} <b>clutching</b> <b>a</b> bottle of pills in his hand. Scully sits on Bruckman's bed holding his hand, deeply moved, just as he had predicted. That night Scully sees a commercial for the Stupendous Yappi on TV, causing her to throw her phone at it.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{fourteen}} redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, {{based on the}} Rider-Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork. The cards depict band members in surrealistic tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect the iconography of the album's lyrical content: The Fool is stepping off a cliff, with grainy images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a JFK campaign poster in the background; The Emperor, with prosthetic legs, {{is sitting in a}} wheelchair <b>clutching</b> <b>a</b> rifle in front of an American flag; Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album's inner sleeve contains these three images, along with a further nine: The Magician, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Hermit, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star and The World. The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.|$|E

5|$|Danielle {{arrives in}} Walford, having left her {{hometown}} of Telford and is befriended by local resident Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), who gives her a job on her market clothing stall and offers her the spare room in her family's home. Danielle quickly develops a crush on fellow stall-trader Callum Monks (Elliott Jordan), who leads her on {{in an attempt to}} make Stacey jealous but he helps her get a second job, cleaning at The Queen Victoria public house, where she gets caught in the feud between Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Janus) and Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb). Both try to use Danielle to get information from the other, with Archie persuading Danielle to steal Ronnie's post. Ronnie is furious when she realises and sacks Danielle after publicly berating her. Danielle is devastated, and is later seen <b>clutching</b> <b>a</b> locket containing a photograph of Ronnie, revealing herself to be Ronnie's long-lost daughter, Amy.|$|E
5|$|The statue {{depicts a}} doughboy walking through {{shattered}} tree stumps strung with barbed wire, his rifle {{in his left}} hand and his right hand held high above his head, <b>clutching</b> <b>a</b> hand grenade. The aggressive design and affordability of the statue made it extremely popular, and more than 150 copies of it were created for municipal memorials across the nation. The Smithsonian American Art Museum currently lists 159 locations. Of that number, 134 currently existing originals have been independently authenticated, and several have been identified as copies by other artists (notably Over the Top by John Paulding). Viquesney's actual brochures quoted a figure of over 300 by the late 1930s, claiming at least one in every state of the Union, but this is believed to be an inflated figure.|$|E
5|$|Metallica {{began by}} playing shows in local clubs in Los Angeles. They {{recorded}} several demos to gain attention from club owners, and eventually relocated to San Francisco {{to secure the}} services of bassist Cliff Burton. The group's No Life 'til Leather demo (1982) was noticed by Megaforce label head Jon Zazula, who signed them and provided a small budget of $15,000 for recording. The album was recorded in May with producer Paul Curcio at the Music America Studios in Rochester, New York. It was originally intended to be titled Metal Up Your Ass, with cover art featuring a hand <b>clutching</b> <b>a</b> dagger emerging from a toilet bowl. The band was asked to change the name because distributors feared that releasing an album with such an offensive title and artwork would diminish its chances of commercial success. Metallica promoted the album on the two-month co-headlining Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven in the U.S. Although the initial shipment was 15,000 copies in the U.S., the album sold 60,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} Metallica's Seven Dates of Hell European tour in 1984.|$|E

It is said that during these last years, he lived with Saya Saung and that two of his other students, Saya Mya and Hein Soon, also helped {{to take care of}} him. Nyan Shein gives Ba Zaw’s date of death as 1943, but Amar claims that her husband found Ba Zaw’s obituary in the newspaper and that he died on 11 December 1942.|$|E
25|$|Watteau alarmed {{his friends}} by a {{carelessness}} {{about his future}} and financial security, as if foreseeing he would not live for long. In fact he had been sickly and physically fragile since childhood. In 1720, he travelled to London, England, to consult Dr. Richard Mead, {{one of the most}} fashionable physicians of his time and an admirer of Watteau's work. However, London's damp and smoky air offset any benefits of Dr. Mead's wholesome food and medicines. Watteau returned to France and spent his last few months on the estate of his patron, Abbé Haranger, where he died in 1721, perhaps from tuberculous laryngitis, at the age of 36. The Abbé said Watteau was semi-conscious and mute during his final days, <b>clutching</b> <b>a</b> paint brush and painting imaginary paintings in the air.|$|E

25|$|Ronnie has {{a tumultuous}} {{relationship}} with employee, Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace), eventually leading to Danielle being sacked and Ronnie publicly berating her. Danielle is devastated, and is later seen <b>clutching</b> <b>a</b> locket containing {{a photograph of}} Ronnie, revealing herself to be Ronnie's daughter. It transpires that Danielle {{is the result of}} a teenage romance between Ronnie and her first boyfriend, Joel Reynolds (Cavan Clerkin). Archie disapproved of the pregnancy and put Danielle—named Amy by Ronnie—up for adoption. Danielle was adopted by Lizzie and Andy Jones (Aneirin Hughes), and is now trying to locate her birth mother. On Archie and Peggy's wedding day, Danielle tells Ronnie that she is her daughter. Ronnie does not believe her because Archie told her that her daughter is dead, and throws her out. She later realises that Danielle was telling the truth and tries to apologise to Danielle but she is hit by Janine Butcher's (Charlie Brooks) car and dies in Ronnie's arms. Danielle's adoptive father, Andy, comes to London to get her and takes Danielle's remains back to Telford and bans Ronnie from the funeral. Despite this, Ronnie goes to Telford and Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) convinces Andy to talk to Ronnie about Danielle. Grieving for the daughter she was not allowed to raise, Ronnie becomes obsessed with having a baby. She tries tricking Jack into getting her pregnant and rekindles her romance with Joel until she learns that he has had a vasectomy so Ronnie ends their relationship. She gets pregnant by Owen Turner (Lee Ross), but miscarries when Archie pushes her into the bar during an argument. Archie is later murdered and Ronnie is arrested as a suspect but released without charge. When Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering their father, Ronnie reveals that Archie raped Stacey, and did the same to her when she was 13. Stacey's husband Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) is posthumously assumed guilty of the murder after falling from the roof of the Queen Vic while trying to evade police arrest.|$|E
500|$|Gauguin's figure {{seems to}} invoke the Polynesian goddess Hina, {{depicted}} by Morice as a Diana-like deity <b>clutching</b> <b>a</b> wolf cub, [...] "monstrous and majestic, drunk with pride, rage and sorrow". He titled an 1894 self-portrait in plaster as Oviri. The original is lost {{but a number of}} bronze casts survive. He used double mirrors to capture his familiar Inca profile, the result reprising his Jug in the Form of a Head, Self-Portrait. This was one of the earliest occasions Gauguin applied the term Oviri to himself. [...] "Gauguin sometimes also referred to himself as Oviri, the savage...", writes Merete Bodelsen. The Stuttgart version of his 1892 oil painting E haere oe i hia (Where Are You Going?) depicts a woman <b>clutching</b> <b>a</b> wolf cub. Pollitt remarks that this stocky, sculptural and androgynous figure gives a first glimpse of Oviri.|$|E

The photo was {{a reference to the}} early criticism of Madonna's work, when reviewers had described her voice as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium".|$|E
