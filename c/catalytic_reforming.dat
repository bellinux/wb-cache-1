5|$|Rhenium in {{the form}} of rhenium-platinum alloy is used as {{catalyst}} for <b>catalytic</b> <b>reforming,</b> which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery naphthas with low octane ratings into high-octane liquid products. Worldwide, 30% of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium. The olefin metathesis is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normally Re2O7 on alumina is used for this process. Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is {{as a catalyst}} in chemical reactions, often as platinum black. It has been employed as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in <b>catalytic</b> <b>reforming</b> of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a catalyst for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E

25|$|As a {{sustainable}} {{alternative to the}} relatively inefficient electrolysis, hydrogen can be generated from organic wastes (such as biomass or food-industry waste), using <b>catalytic</b> <b>reforming.</b> This releases hydrogen from carbonaceous substances at only 10–20% of energy used by electrolysis and may lead to hydrogen being produced from municipal wastes at below zero cost (allowing for the tipping fees and efficient <b>catalytic</b> <b>reforming,</b> such as cold-plasma). Catalytic (thermal) reforming is possible in small, distributed (even mobile) plants, {{to take advantage of}} low-value, stranded biomass/biowaste or natural gas deposits. Conversion of such wastes into ammonia solves the problem of hydrogen storage, as hydrogen can be released economically from ammonia on-demand, without the need for high-pressure or cryogenic storage.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} reason for removing sulfur from the naphtha streams within a petroleum refinery is that sulfur, even in extremely low concentrations, poisons the noble metal catalysts (platinum and rhenium) in the <b>catalytic</b> <b>reforming</b> units that are subsequently used to upgrade the octane rating of the naphtha streams.|$|E

25|$|Heterogeneous {{catalysts}} {{are usually}} solids, powdered {{in order to}} maximize their surface area. Of particular importance in heterogeneous catalysis are the platinum group metals and other transition metals, which are used in hydrogenations, <b>catalytic</b> <b>reforming</b> and in the synthesis of commodity chemicals such as nitric acid and ammonia. Acids are an example of a homogeneous catalyst, they increase the nucleophilicity of carbonyls, allowing a reaction that would not otherwise proceed with electrophiles. The advantage of homogeneous catalysts is the ease of mixing them with the reactants, but they may also be difficult to separate from the products. Therefore, heterogeneous catalysts are preferred in many industrial processes.|$|E
25|$|In <b>catalytic</b> <b>reforming,</b> {{a mixture}} of {{hydrocarbons}} with boiling points between 60–200°C is blended with hydrogen gas and then exposed to a bifunctional platinum chloride or rhenium chloride catalyst at 500–525°C and pressures ranging from 8–50 atm. Under these conditions, aliphatic hydrocarbons form rings and lose hydrogen to become aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture (or reformate) by extraction with any {{one of a number}} of solvents, including diethylene glycol or sulfolane, and benzene is then separated from the other aromatics by distillation. The extraction step of aromatics from the reformate is designed to produce aromatics with lowest non-aromatic components. Recovery of the aromatics, commonly referred to as BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene isomers), involves such extraction and distillation steps. There are a good many licensed processes available for extraction of the aromatics.|$|E

Influential factors including temperature, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of bio-oil, mass ratio of steam to bio-oil (S/B) as well as catalyst type on hydrogen selectivity and other desirable gas products were investigated. Based on hydrogen in stoichiometric potential and carbon balance in gaseous phase and feed, hydrogen yield and carbon selectivity were examined. The experimental results show that higher temperature favors the hydrogen selectivity by H 2 mole fraction in gaseous products stream and it {{plays an important role}} in hydrogen yield and carbon selectivity. Higher hydrogen selectivity and yield, and carbon selectivity were obtained at lower bio-oil WHSV. In <b>catalytic</b> steam <b>reforming</b> system a maximum steam concentration value exists, at which hydrogen selectivity and yield, and carbon selectivity keep constant. Through experiments, preferential operation conditions were obtained as follows: temperature 800 ~ 850 ℃, bio-oil WHSV below 3. 0 h− 1, and mass ratio of steam to bio-oil 10 ~ 12.

40|$|Hydrogen {{production}} from renewable resources has received extensive attention recently for a sustainable and renewable future. In this study, hydrogen was produced from <b>catalytic</b> steam <b>reforming</b> of the aqueous fraction of crude bio-oil, which {{was obtained from}} pyrolysis of biomass. Five Ni-Al catalysts modified with Ca, Ce, Mg, Mn and Zn were investigated using a fixed-bed reactor. Optimized process conditions were obtained with a steam reforming temperature of 800 °C and a steam to carbon ratio of 3. 54. The life time of the catalysts in terms of stability of hydrogen production and prohibition of coke formation {{on the surface of}} the catalyst were carried out with continuous feeding of raw materials for 4 h.

In addition, the life-time test of catalytic experiments showed that all the catalysts suffered deactivation at the beginning of the experiment (reduction of hydrogen production), except for the Ni-Mg-Al catalyst; it is suggested that the observation of abundant amorphous carbon formed on the surface of reacted catalysts (temperature programmed oxidation results) may be responsible for the initial reduction of hydrogen production.
