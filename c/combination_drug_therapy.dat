40|$|We study a {{class of}} {{structured}} optimal control problems in which the main diagonal of the dynamic matrix is a linear function of the design variable. While such problems are in general challenging and nonconvex, for positive systems we prove convexity of the H_ 2 and H_∞ optimal control formulations which allow for arbitrary convex constraints and regularization of the control input. Moreover, we establish differentiability of the H_∞ norm when the graph associated with the dynamical generator is weakly connected and develop a customized algorithm for computing the optimal solution {{even in the absence}} of differentiability. We apply our results to the problems of leader selection in directed consensus networks and <b>combination</b> <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> for HIV treatment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{evidence}} of effective <b>combination</b> <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> for secondary prevention of {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD), older adults with this condition remain undertreated. OBJECTIVE: To describe time trends (1992 - 2003) in the adoption of combination cardiac drug therapies (beta-blockers [beta-adrenoceptor antagonists], ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists [angiotensin receptor blockers; ARBs], and lipid-lowering agents) among older adults in the US with CHD and to identify factors associated with not using combination therapy.

40|$|International audienceCancer is a multi-factorial disease {{resulting}} in uncontrolled division of body cells, with difficult and complex suppression. The main treatment strategy for this disease depends on killing of tumor cells that usually {{exist in the}} proximity of normal body cells.

Therefore, it seems that <b>combination</b> <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> is a suitable solution to address the mentioned concern.

40|$|Cancer is {{a leading}} cause of death both in the United States and worldwide. In this thesis we use machine {{learning}} and optimization to identify effective treatments for advanced cancers and to identify effective screening strategies for detecting early-stage disease. In Part I, we propose a methodology for designing <b>combination</b> <b>drug</b> <b>therapies</b> for advanced cancer, evaluating our approach using advanced gastric cancer. First, we build a database of 414 clinical trials testing chemotherapy regimens for this cancer, extracting information about patient demographics, study characteristics, chemotherapy regimens tested, and outcomes. We use this database to build statistical models to predict trial efficacy and toxicity outcomes. We propose models that use machine learning and optimization to suggest regimens to be tested in Phase II and III clinical trials, evaluating our suggestions with both simulated outcomes and the outcomes of clinical trials testing similar regimens. In Part II, we evaluate how well the methodology from Part I generalizes to advanced breast cancer. We build a database of 1, 490 clinical trials testing <b>drug</b> <b>therapies</b> for breast cancer, train statistical models to predict trial efficacy and toxicity outcomes, and suggest <b>combination</b> <b>drug</b> <b>therapies</b> to be tested in Phase II and III studies. In this work we model differences in drug effects based on the receptor status of patients in a clinical trial, and we evaluate whether combining clinical trial databases of different cancers can improve clinical trial toxicity predictions. In Part III, we propose a methodology for decision making when multiple mathematical models have been proposed for a phenomenon of interest, using our approach to identify effective population screening strategies for prostate cancer. We implement three published mathematical models of prostate cancer screening strategy outcomes, using optimization to identify strategies that all models find to be effective. by John Silberholz.

40|$|The Grb- 2 {{associated}} binder (Gab) {{family of}} scaffolding/adaptor/docking proteins {{is a group}} of three molecules with significant roles in cytokine receptor signaling. Gabs possess structural motifs for phosphorylation-dependent receptor recruitment, Grb 2 binding, and activation of downstream signaling pathways through p 85 and SHP- 2. In addition, Gabs participate in hematopoiesis and regulation of immune response which can be aberrantly activated in cancer and inflammation. The multifunctionality of Gab adapters might suggest that they would be too difficult to consider as candidates for “targeted” therapy.
