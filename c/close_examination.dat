5|$|<b>Close</b> <b>examination</b> of {{the inner}} region of the Andromeda Galaxy with the same {{telescope}} also showed a smaller dust ring that {{is believed to have}} been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200 million years ago. Simulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of the Andromeda Galaxy along the latter's polar axis. This collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in Andromeda.|$|E
5|$|However, a <b>close</b> <b>examination</b> of the {{excavated}} tracks {{may give}} a more differentiated picture. While there is {{agreement that the}} grooves {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at all. On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no simple}} way of {{differentiating}} a venomous snake from a non-venomous one merely by using a scale character.

Scale patterns help to indicate the species and from the references, it can be verified if the snake species is known to be venomous or not.|$|E
5|$|With its rhythmic {{arrangement}} of large, traceried windows, pinnacles, battlements and buttresses, {{the exterior of}} Chester Cathedral from the south presents a fairly homogeneous character, which is an unusual feature as England's cathedrals are in general noted for their stylistic diversity. <b>Close</b> <b>examination</b> reveals window tracery of several building stages from the 13th to the early 16thcentury. The richness of the 13th-century tracery is accentuated {{by the presence of}} ornate, crocketted drip-mouldings around the windows; those around the perpendicular windows are of simpler form.|$|E
5|$|<b>Close</b> <b>examination</b> of the {{spectral}} lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, {{which is an}} interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the painted}} {{production}} of Verrocchio's workshop {{was done by}} his employees. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his The Baptism of Christ, painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe {{in a manner that}} was so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again, although this is believed to be apocryphal. <b>Close</b> <b>examination</b> reveals areas that have been painted or touched-up over the tempera using the new technique of oil paint; the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain stream and much of the figure of Jesus bearing witness to the hand of Leonardo. Leonardo may have been the model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David in the Bargello and the Archangel Raphael in Tobias and the Angel.|$|E
5|$|Asplenium bradleyi {{is similar}} to two hybrid species {{of which it is}} a parent, Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid with A.pinnatifidum, and Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a {{backcross}} with A.montanum. In A.×gravesii, the dark color of the stipe ends {{at the base of the}} leaf blade, the pinnae are more shallowly lobed and the enlargement of acroscopic lobes or pinnules is less distinct, and the apical portion of the blade forms a long, tapering tip with slight lobes (as in A.pinnatifidum), rather than being cut into pinnae. In addition to the general reduction of the toothiness of A.bradleyi, A.×gravesii also shows faint winging along the stipe. Likewise, in A.×wherryi, the dark color of the stipe again ends at the base of the leaf blade, the overall shape of the blade tends to be more distinctly lance-shaped, and the fronds are somewhat more deeply cut than A.bradleyi, progressing from bipinnate in the lower half to pinnate-pinnatifid and finally pinnate at the apex. Finally, the diploid hybrid A.montanum × platyneuron, from which A.bradleyi arose by chromosome doubling, is essentially identical in appearance to A.bradleyi. On <b>close</b> <b>examination,</b> its spores are found to be abortive, and the sori are smaller and not do not become fused with each other as they grow, as they do in fertile A.bradleyi.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork {{for the cover}} for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on video when <b>close</b> <b>examination</b> of the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear {{on the cover of}} the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.|$|E
