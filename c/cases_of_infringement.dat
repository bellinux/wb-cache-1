40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the legal principles which are relevant {{in determining the}} appropriate level of compensation for infringements to aboriginal and treaty rights. This issue has been left open by the Supreme Court of Canada in the seminal case of Delgamuukw. The nature of aboriginal and treaty rights {{as well as the}} fiduciary relationship and duties of the Crown are briefly described. The basic constitutional context in which these rights evolve is also discussed, including the federal common law of aboriginal rights and the constitutional position of these rights in Canada. Having set the general context, the paper then reviews the legal principles governing the infringement of aboriginal and treaty rights, including the requirement for just compensation. Reviews of the legal principles applicable to compensation in cases of expropriation and of the experience in the United States in regards to compensation in cases of the taking of aboriginal lands are also carried out. Six basic legal principles relevant for determining appropriate compensation in <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> to aboriginal and treaty rights are then suggested, justified and explained.

40|$|The Personal Data Protection Act {{was enacted}} in 1997; it imposed some {{obligations}} {{on all the}} administrators of personal data regardless if acting as private or public establishments. The Act was intended to guarantee the safety of personal data and to ensure the right to controlling the data processing. However, since the enacting of the Act, there have been reported instances of its infringement, especially by private entrepreneurs. The numerous appealed complaints show that the entrepreneurs neglect their duty of ensuring the safety of personal data (e. g. documents or media with such personal data), which results in unauthorised revealing the data to third parties. An especially serious case of the infringements of the Act {{and the rights of}} the persons concerned is selling the data without a person’s consent. In many cases the administrator only seemingly informs about the purposes of processing the data and then, in this or any other insidious way (among them an inacceptable presumption of consent), beguiles the necessary acceptance. The occurrences of neglecting duties imposed by the Act are to be considered not only as infringement of law, but also as unethical actions resulting in undermining customers’ confidence in entrepreneurs. For example: The unprotected data can be viewed and used by unauthorised parties {{to the detriment of the}} persons concerned (e. g. identity theft). The selling of the data is also a source of an unjustifiable profit for an entrepreneur and makes controlling of the processing of personal data impossible. Even if there are no negative consequences for the customer, the <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> the Personal Data Protection Act bring about to undermine confidence not only in the entrepreneur (the source of personal data) but also in private establishments in general...|$|E
40|$|The {{great impact}} on soils in Republic of Moldova is {{represented}} by the non-ecological exploitation of agricultural land, non-sanitation of rural space, massive negligence of population and local authorities, surveillance and control authorities of land resources.  The most common form of impact on soils is erosion. Very rapid increase of the surfaces affected by erosion is conditioned, in particular, by the non-compliance of environmental requirements to allocation and exploitation of agricultural land and by the actual inefficient management of land resources.  In the last two decades, there has been a significant reduction of ecological laboratories for soil quality evaluation, conditioned by liquidation of district and regional centres of plant protection. The State Ecological Inspectorate, which has the exclusive function of ecological damage evaluation, has very modest financial and human resources. As a result, despite the frequent <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> of soil and land protection, because of very low evaluation capacity, most environmental damage in this area are not established and subject to compensation, and most land beneficiaries ignore normative of land and soil use and protection.  Due to financial shortages in rural areas apply minimum rates of fines, which do not reflect the real impact on the soil cover. The collected sums from the application of fines are significantly lower than the damage caused to the soils. Under the new Offences Code, it was introduced the penalty for burning stubble, substantially increasing the payment discharge and the amounts of fines for unauthorized land use and for destruction of soil fertile layer. However, there is no positive change in penalties for causing erosion, for falsifying and concealing information about the status of land.  Most damage compensation actions are brought for burning stubble and for soil contamination, while compensation actions for damage caused by erosion and landslides are a major exception. Despite the existence of adequate methodology for evaluations of soil injury, their practical implementation is very superficially, what conditioned the illicit behaviour of land beneficiaries...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} how {{the application}} of the STPA method might support the evaluation of fighter pilots training programs and trigger procedural and technological changes. We applied the STPA method by considering the safety constraints documented in the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of a South European Air Force and regard a flight of a two F- 16 aircraft formation. In this context, we derived the control actions and feedback mechanisms that are available to the leader pilot during an Aircraft Combat Maneuver (ACM) mission, and we developed the control flow diagram based on the aircraft manuals. We compared the results of each analysis step with the respective flight training program, which is based on a mixed skill and rule-based decision-making, and we examined the role of the feedback mechanisms during multiple safety constraints violations. The analysis showed that: the flight training program under study does not structurally include <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> of multiple safety constraints; the maintenance of some safety constraints are not supported by alerts, or rely on only one human sense; the existing procedures do not refer to the prioritization of pilot actions in cases of violation of multiple safety constraints; operation manuals do not address the cases of possible human performance deterioration when simultaneous information from feedback mechanisms is received. The results demonstrated the benefits of the STPA method, {{the application of}} which uncovered various inadequacies in the flight training program studied, some of them related to the F- 16 cockpit ergonomics. The analysis lead to recommendations in regard to the amendment of the corresponding fighter pilots training program, and the conduction of further research regarding the aircraft – pilot interaction when multiple safety constraints are violated. The approach presented in this paper can be also followed for the (re) evaluation of flight training schemes in military, civil and general aviation, as well by any human-machine interface intensive domain...|$|E
