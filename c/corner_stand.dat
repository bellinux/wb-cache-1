2500|$|Further {{improvements}} in 1970 included the coupling of the West Stand and the Kop with a £200,000 <b>corner</b> <b>stand,</b> the North-West corner. To complement the upgrade, an almost identical stand was built, linking the Lowfields stand and the Kop, which cost £200,000.

In 1974, Leeds won the league {{for the second}} time and the Scratching Shed was dismantled and replaced by the South Stand at a cost of £500,000. This state of the art development comprised a standing paddock capable of holding 4,000 fans, a row of 16 executive boxes, above which was an all-seater 3,500 capacity stand. Plans to link the South Stand with the Lowfields were curtailled when Leeds ran out of money. In the same year, the floodlights were replaced by the tallest floodlights in Europe, measuring [...] Initially three floodlights were erected – two at either side of the Kop and another in the South-West corner – and the other was erected four years later.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1991, the South-East corner was opened, {{joining the}} South and Lowfields Stands {{providing}} a full <b>corner</b> <b>stand</b> for away supporters. This section {{was used as}} the [...] "family stand" [...] until membership proved too big for its 1,710 capacity and a new home found in the East Stand. It is prominent because of its yellow seats, which have given its nickname, the [...] "cheese wedge". A banqueting suite {{at the rear of the}} west stand, with a conference centre, was opened in April 1992. The biggest renovation project to date began in 1992, when the Lowfields was replaced by a new East Stand – a 17,000-seater stand with two tiers and no restricted views. On completion in 1993, at a cost of £5.5m, it housed 25 executive boxes, 10,000 seats in the bottom tier, part of which formed the members-only family section, and a further 7,000 seats in the upper tier. The East Stand was then the biggest cantilever stand in the world. In the close season of 1994 Elland Road became an all-seater stadium, with nearly 7,000 seats replacing the terracing in the Kop, as directed by the Taylor Report. The new-look Kop was officially opened in October by the club's president, George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood and Mrs E Revie, widow of the late Don Revie. The Gelderd End was renamed the Don Revie Stand in honour of the club's former manager.|$|E

"On {{the faith}} of a woodman's eye, it well may be," [...] said Eben Dudley; [...] "but should it be haunted by a legion of wicked spirits, one may bring it to quiet from the loop at the nearest <b>corner.</b> <b>Stand</b> aside, Madam Heathcote," [...] for the {{character}} and wealth of the proprietors of the valley, gave Ruth a claim to this term of respect among the laborers: [...] "let me thrust the piece through the--stop, there is an especial charm in the gun, which it might be sinful to waste on such a creature.

50|$|The East Stand is a two-tier development, {{completed}} in 1993. Funded {{in part by}} the football trust, the stand has a capacity of 7,492 and replaced a large covered terrace known as the Brewery Stand. The East Stand was designed by NYP Architects, as were the North Stand and the <b>Corner</b> <b>Stand.</b> With the completion of the East Stand, Barnsley FC became the first football club in Yorkshire to incorporate 'executive boxes' into their stadium. The East stand is very modern, and has plenty of legroom.|$|E

50|$|In {{the main}} studio itself, where Donati {{received}} his clients {{in an atmosphere}} as polished as an office of a top executive, one hardly {{realized that it was}} here that the artist actually painted. His easel was covered with Persian blue velvet, the painting on the easel was already framed, his chair was upholstered in red velvet and on his palette the colors were arranged with the precision of a Byzantine mosaic. In a <b>corner</b> <b>stand</b> were his latest works, framed and ready to be sent off to his next exhibition in Europe or America.|$|E

Chase began {{working in the}} kitchen at the restaurant during the 1950s, and over time, Leah and Dooky took over the stand and converted it into a sit-down establishment. She eventually updated the menu to reflect her own family's Creole recipes as well as recipes--Shrimp Clemenceau--otherwise available only in whites-only establishments from which she and her patrons were barred.|$|E

50|$|The {{music room}} with its square piano from around 1830 is notable for its painted friezes and a {{medallion}} painted above the fireplace.

50|$|The Greek section, {{about an}} acre in size, is bounded by a hedge. Like the Chinese lot, it was opened in 1911. There are many {{impressive}} monuments in it, practically all inscribed in Greek. In the southwest <b>corner</b> <b>stands</b> a small church, resembling a miniature Parthenon and constructed of yellow brick.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} built of white Suffolk bricks and is orientated {{east to west}} with the tower {{positioned}} south of the central bay. The entrance is through a porch, built into base of the tower, facing down Addison Avenue. The simple body of the church makes the three-stage tower, built in 1850, stand out. The first stage has gabled Buttresses with roll-moulded edges. The second stage has a clock-face set in on each side and is considerably shorter than any other stage. The final belfry stage has two deeply-recessed paired lancets flanked by single blind lancet panels. There is a drawing in Kensington Public Library which shows that the tower was designed to have been topped with a broach spire, however, this was never built, and the tower seems somewhat abrupt and unfinished without it, as the thin octagonal pinnacles on each <b>corner</b> <b>stand</b> out against the sky.Vulliamy's original design provided polygonal apsidal projections at {{the east and west}} ends, but these were never built. In 1876 the eastern end was extended by the architect, R. J. Withers. These extensions provide the present chancel, vestries and an organ chamber.|$|E
5000|$|A {{writer for}} the Arizona Daily Wildcat {{newspaper}} wrote an article in regards to this mural. [...] "Bottles of paint, turpentine and tequila surround an artist {{lying on his back}} atop scaffolding. It is the spring of 1944 and American GIs are overseas fighting the axis powers. The artist strokes his brush on the wall about two stories tall and 15 feet wide until a mural begins to emerge. Night after night, the painter pieces together his puzzle. The colors are dark, as are the images. Skeletons, mortarboards, books and the apocalypse fill the cinder block canvas."His mural depicted [...] "skulls topped with mortarboards peer(ing) at an open hand holding the flame of knowledge reaching out of a pile of books. The skulls represent people searching for knowledge. A figure, half-machine half-skeleton, resides atop the four horses of the apocalypse, trampling over the mask of happiness. The mask of tragedy remains untouched. The figure holds the World in its right hand; from its shoulder hangs a long sheet simple titled [...] "News." [...] In the far-left <b>corner</b> <b>stand</b> six skeletons donning graduating robes ... starving professors hang by their necks from the fingertips of a skeletal hand as the four horseman gallop over snakes slithering through books." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{the room}} of a Spartan or a soldier. In one <b>corner</b> <b>stood</b> a wide, canvas-covered cot; in another, a small bookcase; in another, a grim stand of Winchesters and shotguns.
