40|$|Objectives: Detection of <b>cervical</b> N 3 <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> is {{currently}} not a routine preoperative investigation for lung cancer patients. We designed {{a study to}} assess if the frequency and accuracy of detection of metastatic <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> using <b>cervical</b> ultrasonography (US) and fine needle aspiration (FNA) justify their routine use in all lung cancer patients with impalpable <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Methods: Fifty patients with suspected and potentially operable {{non-small cell lung cancer}} were enrolled. Patients with palpable <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were excluded. In addition to routine preoperative investigations, all patients received cervical US to determine the presence of <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Nodes suspicious of harboring malignancy according to a specific set of sonographic criteria (which include shape, echogenicity, nodal architecture, and vascular patterns) were subjected to biopsy by ultrasound-guided FNA. Results: Normal <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> were detected by cervical US in 30 patients (60 %). <b>Cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> suspicious of harboring malignancy were detected in 10 patients (20 %). FNA confirmed cervical nodal metastasis in four of these patients (8 %). The TNM staging of two patients (4 %) was revised up to stage IIIb as a result, excluding them from further surgery. Cost analysis suggests this technique to be cost-effective when used as a routine preoperative investigation to exclude patients from unnecessary surgical intervention. No mortality or complications were encountered in all patients. Conclusions: Cervical US and FNA is a safe and cost-effective method of evaluating the status of impalpable <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in lung cancer patients. Further study is warranted to establish the role of cervical US and FNA in lung cancer staging algorithms. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|Metastasis to {{regional}} lymphnodes is common as the tonsil has a rich supply of lymphatics {{giving way to}} the tumor cells to metastasis to other lymph nodes (commonly the lymph nodes of neck) and cause lymphydenopathy. The cervical lyphydenopathy can be ipsilateral (70% or more patients) or bilateral (30% and fewer patients). The carcinoma of tonsil usually spreads through the <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> levels II, III, IV, V, and retropharyngeal lymph nodes.|$|E
5000|$|Metastatic {{lymph nodes}} are {{enlarged}} because tumor cells have {{detached from the}} primary tumor and started growing in the lymph node ("seeded"). Since cancer generally occurs more frequently in older people, this kind of lymphadenopathy {{is more common in}} older persons. Metastatic lymph nodes tend to feel hard and may be fixed to underlying tissues and {{may or may not be}} tender. Usually the lymph nodes that directly drain the area of the cancer are affected by the spread, e.g. Sometimes metastatic <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> is detected before the main cancer. In such cases, this discovery leads to a search for the primary malignancy, firstly in the nearby area with endoscopy, [...] "blind" [...] biopsies, and tonsillectomy on the side of the lymphadenopathy. If no tumor is found, then the rest of the body is examined, looking for lung cancer or other possible sites. If still no primary tumor is detected, the term [...] "occult primary" [...] is used.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} ultrasonography for the diagnosis of <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis in esophageal carcinoma. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Ultrasound (US) examination is useful for diagnosing lymph node metastasis. However, few reports have examined {{its role in the}} decision to perform <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection in esophageal carcinoma. METHODS: Ultrasound examination was performed to evaluate <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis in 519 patients with esophageal carcinoma. The patients were divided into 5 groups according to treatment received: group 1, 153 patients who underwent curative resection of primary tumor by right thoracotomy and complete bilateral cervical lymphadenectomy; group 2, 112 patients who underwent curative resection of primary tumor by right thoracotomy but without cervical lymphadenectomy; group 3, 78 patients who underwent esophagectomy by left thoracotomy or blunt dissection with or without removal of cervical lymph nodes; group 4, 76 patients with palliative resection without cervical lymphadenectomy; and group 5, 100 patients without any surgical treatment. US diagnosis was compared with histologic findings or <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> recurrence. RESULTS: Lymph node metastasis was detected in 30. 8 % of patients (160 / 519). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of US diagnosis in group 1 were 74. 5 %, 94. 1 %, and 87. 6 %, respectively. <b>Cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> recurrence was seen in 7 patients (4. 6 %) in group 1, in 4 patients (3. 6 %) in group 2, and 3 patients (3. 8 %) in group 3. Although the incidence of <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis as determined by US examination was high in groups 4 and 5, almost none of the patients died of <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis.

40|$|Background and ObjectivesZZCervical {{lymph node}} {{metastasis}} {{is a very}} important prognos-tic factor of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Therefore, strict evaluation of <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis is necessary for accurate staging and proper treatment plan-ning.

40|$|Accurate {{and early}} {{diagnosis}} of <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis {{is essential to}} control metastatic lesions of oral cancer and thus improve the results of treatment. <b>Cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis is usually diagnosed by palpation, computerized tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thirty-three patients (25 male, 8 female) with oral primary squamous cell carcinoma were examined for <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis by palpation, CT, and US before undergoing radical neck dissection. The results of these examinations were then compared with the histopathological findings, and the accuracy of each method was assessed. The ultrasonography equipment we used was a real-time unit equipped with a high frequency sectional transducer (7. 5 MHz). US revealed <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis in lymph nodes greater than 10 mm in diameter (p < 0. 01), round in shape (p < 0. 01), having fuzzy borders (p< 0. 01), and a heterogeneous internal echo pattern (p < 0. 01). The accuracy rate of US was 96 %, and superior to the 92 % for CT and 80 % for palpation.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the clinical characteristics, prognosis, and risk factors of patients in whom <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> cancer recurred after esophageal cancer surgery with 2 -field lymph node dissection. MethodsBetween 2000 and 2010, 471 consecutive patients who had undergone esophagectomy with 2 -field lymph node dissection for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled in this study. ResultsRecurrence was seen in 96 patients. Isolated <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> recurrence (group A) developed in 21 patients, locoregional recurrence only and without <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> recurrence (group B) in 29, and distant recurrence with or without locoregional recurrence (group C) in 46 patients. The median times to recurrence after surgery in groups A, B, and C were 20, 16, and 12 months, respectively (P = . 634). 2 - and 5 -year rates of isolated <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> recurrence were 4. 1 % and 5. 6 %, respectively. The median survival times from diagnosis of recurrence were 13, 7, and 5 months in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The difference in survival between groups A and C was statistically significant (P = . 030). Upper thoracic esophageal cancer and positive recurrent laryngeal node at the time of initial surgery were independent risk factors for cervical recurrence-free survival as determined by univariate and multivariate analysis. ConclusionsThis study shows that 2 -field lymph node dissection can be performed with an acceptable rate of <b>cervical</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> recurrence.
