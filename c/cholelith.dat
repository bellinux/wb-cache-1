40|$|A {{pregnant}} 3. 5 year-old high-productive Holstein cow in {{the third}} month of lactation showed colic signs, marked anorexia, and stopped milk production. Clinical examination revealed tachypnea, pyrexia and the mucous membranes were all congested. Signs of abdominal discomfort were observed, the abdomen was tense and painful; digestive activity was poor. Blood investigations revealed inflammation, cholestasis, and leucocytosis with marked neutrophilia. Trans-abdominal ultrasonography revealed decreased digestive transit and enlarged gall-bladder. Hepatic or biliary involvement was suspected. A right-flank exploratory laparotomy revealed a gallbladder filled with firm and mobile 0. 5 to 1 cm diameter fluctuant masses. Digital palpation allowed <b>cholelith</b> extraction through the cystic duct into the duodenum. After the surgery, the cow progressively regained a normal appetite and pain signs decreased. Blood samples analysed 10 days after the surgery still showed inflammation but to a lesser extent. Hepatic enzymes were markedly increased, indicating hepatic injury. Three months after the surgery, the cow was healthy and was inseminated. This case report suggests that cholelithiasis may be diagnosed and successfully treated in early stage of the disease in cattle, though this condition is rare in this species. This is the second report of manual <b>cholelith</b> extraction in a cow. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A 2. 5 -year-old female {{guinea pig}} (Cavia porcellus) {{presented}} for reduced appetite, signs of abdominal pain, increased respiratory effort, and a distended abdomen. Cholelithiasis was diagnosed by radiography and ultrasonography. The <b>cholelith</b> was surgically removed using cholecystectomy. After surgery the animal recovered quickly and clinical signs resolved. Stone analysis revealed a composition of 20 % weddellite (calcium oxalate dehydrate) and 80 % apatite (calcium phosphate). Histologic {{examination of the}} gallbladder revealed no significant pathologic changes. Three months after the surgical procedure the patient continued to do well and diagnostic imaging revealed no abnormalities. Surgical therapy was straightforward and effective...|$|E
40|$|With an {{increased}} number of pet reptiles, many diseases occur due to nutritional disorders. Between 2013 and 2015, irregular gallbladder contents (sludge/choleliths) in adult bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps) were recorded {{in many of the}} routinely conducted necropsies at the reptile rescue station in Munich (Auffangstation f€ur Rep-tilien, M€unchen e. V., Munich, Germany). Nine animals, six from the rescue station and three from an associated veterinary practice (Tier€arztliche Praxis f€ur Exoten, Augsburg, Germany), were studied. Gallbladder contents from all animals were analysed at the Institute for Clinical Chemistry in Zurich, Switzerland. In three of nine ani-mals, one <b>cholelith</b> composed of 100 % calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) was detected and it precipitated either as pure calcite or as a calcite:vaterite combination. In the remaining six animals, analyses suggested a protein-based material. The detection of choleliths/sludge was not anticipated at necropsy or surgery in eight of nine animals. The diet of the six animals from the rescue station was retrospectively described as mainly insects, whereas the diet of the three animals from the veterinary practice also contained little plant matter. Fed insect species were mealworm larva (Tenebrio molitor), house cricket (Acheta domestica), migratory locust (Locusta migratoria) and zophobas larva (Zophobas morio), all high in protein and fat. In other species, a nidus must be present for CaCO 3 to precipitate. As a protein-based sludge was detected in six gallbladders, it is possible that a high-protein diet could lead to such a nidus and subsequently to <b>cholelith</b> formation. Cholelithiasis seems to be a rising problem in adult bearded dragons and is likely underdiagnosed, as many choleliths were found at necropsy. This rise in cholelithiasis may correlate with an unnatural high-protein, high-fat insect-based diet instead of a balanced plant-based diet...|$|E
40|$|A 10 -year-old, {{neutered}} male, keeshond {{was presented}} for vomiting, lethargy, icterus, and anorexia.

40|$|Various concrements {{from the}} human body were {{investigated}} by metalloscopy, and their growing mechanism was studied. 1. The surface of forty <b>choleliths,</b> more than 50 uro-liths and 2 sialoliths were investigated by metalloscopy. A figure of spiral growth was seen in 9 uroliths, but neither in <b>choleliths</b> nor in sialoliths. 2. As above mentioned, {{there were a few}} caliculi, which developed by spiral growth mechanism, just like the usual crystal formation in the nature. These caliculi were consisted of uric acid mainly. 3. In uric acid caliculi at first the crystal granuli grow in spiral mechanism as elements and play a main roll for growth. In such way they need no strong colloidal chemical changes for their growth. 4. Other caliculi, in which no spiral growth figure has been found, are of course to have to had crystals as their main elements. Therefore it is considered that, they grow in the same spiral mechanism which could not only be found because of their desiccation after extirpation and insufficient magnification...|$|R
40|$|Findings of hepatic and {{gallbladder}} ultrasonography {{were analyzed}} in 12 dogs with gallbladder and/or extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction and {{compared with the}} results of exploratory laparotomy. Hepatic ultrasonography demonstrated normal liver in 2 dogs and hepatic abnormalities in 10 animals. The following ultrasonographic diagnoses were established compared to surgical findings: gallbladder obstruction caused by bile sludge (correct/incorrect: 1 / 2, surgical diagnosis: <b>choleliths</b> in one case), gallbladder obstruction caused by neoplasm (0 / 1, surgical diagnosis: mucocele), gallbladder and extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction due to <b>choleliths</b> (3 / 3), extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction caused by pancreatic mass (1 / 1) and small intestinal volvulus (1 / 1). Bile peritonitis caused by gallbladder rupture (4 / 4) was correctly diagnosed by ultrasound, aided with ultrasonographically-guided abdominocentesis and peritoneal fluid analysis. Rupture of the gallbladder should be suspected {{in the presence of a}} small, echogenic gallbladder or in the absence of the organ together with free abdominal fluid during ultrasonography. Laparotomy was correctly indicated by ultrasonography in all cases. However, the direct cause of obstruction could not be determined in 2 of the 12 dogs by ultrasonography alone...|$|R
40|$|A 26 -year-old female, {{thirteen}} months postpartum, {{presented to}} the emergency department for four weeks of epigastric abdominal pain, pruritus, new onset jaundice, and 11. 3 [*]kgs (25 [*]lbs) unintentional weight loss. On examination, she was afebrile, tachycardic, alert, and oriented and had jaundice with scleral icterus. Labs were significant for undetectable TSH, FT 4 that was too high to measure, and elevated total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and transaminases. Abdominal ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis without biliary ductal dilation. Treatment for presumed thyroid storm was initiated. Further work-up with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed an obstructing <b>cholelith</b> within the distal common bile duct. With the presence of choledocholithiasis explaining the jaundice and abdominal pain, plus the absence of CNS alterations, the diagnosis of thyroid storm was revised to thyrotoxicosis complicated by choledocholithiasis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) with sphincterotomy was performed to alleviate the biliary obstruction, with prompt symptomatic improvement. Thyroid storm is a rare manifestation of hyperthyroidism with {{a high rate of}} morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis of thyroid storm is based on clinical examination, and abnormal thyroid function tests do not correlate with disease severity. Knowledge of the many manifestations of thyroid storm will facilitate a quick and accurate diagnosis and treatment...|$|E
40|$|A 7 year-old female spayed Presa Canario was {{presented}} to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA) on 6 / 22 / 2011 after a 10 -day history of vomiting, inappetence, and lethargy. The referring veterinarian had documented rising liver enzymes and suspected liver failure of unknown toxic cause. Initial diagnostics at CUHA confirmed increased hepatobiliary enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT), hyperbilirubinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia, and low BUN. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a gallbladder in the high-normal volume range at 2 ml/kg and liver aspirates showed vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes consistent with cholestasis. No evidence of bile duct obstruction was discovered and the dog was managed medically for non-specific infectious and toxic causes of acute liver disease. Liver values were monitored daily and continued to worsen while the dog also became depressed and anorexic and continued to vomit. The dog developed icterus and acholic feces. Repeat abdominal ultrasound was performed five days after admission and revealed an increased gallbladder volume to 3 ml/kg and significant dilation of extra and intra-hepatic bile ducts. This information combined with worsening clinical signs and blood chemistry values justified exploratory laparotomy. The cause of bile duct obstruction was determined to be a <b>cholelith</b> within the ductus choledochus and choledocholithotomy and cholecystectomy were performed. The dog improved clinically and hematologically and was discharged from the hospital four days after surgery. The patient has been monitored by the referring veterinarian and continues to do well four months after surgery with the only abnormality being a mildly increased ALT...|$|E

40|$|An eleven {{year old}} male castrate[d] Standard poodle {{presented}} {{for evaluation of}} a greater than one year history of elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) and hypercholesterolemia with no associated clinical signs of disease. Imaging revealed a mildly distended gall bladder which contained biliary sludge and <b>choleliths.</b> Additionally, the gall bladder was shown to be hypomotile by an ultransonographic serial contractility examination. The organ {{was found to be}} diffusely thickened with irregular walls at the time of exploratory lapartotomy. 	Concretions were palpable in the lumen, the cystic duct was irregularly thickened, and aspirated bile was watery, thin and amber-colored. A cholecystectomy was performed and a multi-drug resistant Enterococcus faecium species was cultured. Histopathology was consistent with an infectious and chronic inflammmatory etiology. It is suspected that an ascending gastrointestinal infection is responsible for this clinically unapparent septic cholecystitis. This case demonstrates the utility and importance of routine blood testing in detecting asymptomatic disease...|$|R
40|$|During {{one month}} {{carcasses}} of 323 cattle (213 bulls and 110 cow) were inspected {{by referring to}} Urmia slaughter-house. Livers and gallbladders of 47 cattle had macroscopic changes. Histopathologic sections were prepared from injured tissues and for bacteriology, contents of injured and normal gallbladders were cultured. Major macroscopic changes that were observed in damaged livers and gallbladders were: increasing of gallbladder thickness, petechiae, <b>choleliths</b> in gallbladder, hepatolithiasis, hepatic fascioliasis and presence of dicrocoelium in gall bladder. Histological sections were stained by hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid schiff and masson’s trichrome staining methods. Cholecystitis, hyperplasia of seromucosal glands’ congestion, hemorrhage, fat necrosis and increased thickness of gallbladder layers were observed. Also Escherichia coli was isolated from 4 gallbladders. In females, the incidence of microscopic changes including cholecystitis, increasing of mucosal layer thickness, hyperplasia of seromucosal glands, hemorrhage in layers except the mucosal layer and presence of bacteria in culture of gallbladder contents was more than males (...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. In this work, {{the problem}} of {{occurrence}} and co-occurrence of titanium, lithium, molybdenum, strontium, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium in the <b>choleliths</b> of the inhabitants of Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała district has been presented. The choice of research area {{was determined by the}} different mineral structure of suspended dust in the air, as well as the average different occurrence of some other minerals in suspended dust in the air. The aim of the studies was to define the level of accumulation and coincidention of Ti, Li, Mo, Sr, Ca, Mg, Na, K in deposits in the gallbladder. Materials and methods. The content of these particular elements in the gall bladder deposits obtained during cholecystectomy was assessed by means of inductive coupled plasma – atomic emission spectrometry (ICP – AES) with accuracy to 0, 01 µg/g. Results. The presence of selected elements in the mineral structure of gall bladder deposits is illustrated by the vast statistical characteristic of their occurrence in the inhabitants of Częstochowa and Bielsko-Biała district. This is also documented by the course of quotient changes of the individual element’s content, compared to their sum in the function of changes of their average content in the gall bladder deposits. Conclusions. The level of examined elements in gallbladder deposits was different according to place of living and gender, those differences being better discriminated by geometrical averages...|$|R
40|$|A 14 -year-old, intact male Siberian Husky was {{examined}} because of recurrence of inappetence, weakness and vomiting. Results of a CBC showed mild normocytic normocromic anaemia, hypereosinophilia with activated monocytes. Increase of ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, cholesterol and bilirubin supported {{a diagnosis of}} hepatobiliary disease. Abdominal ultrasound evaluation showed an incomplete extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction (EHBO), with suspected cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. Any evidence of radiopaque stone was showed at abdominal radiography. A cause to the incomplete response to medical treatment with amoxicilline and clavulanic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, vitamin E and silymarin, biliary surgery was performed, showing a hugely dilated biliary tree and several stones in the common bile duct. The <b>choleliths</b> were removed, using a combined approach through common bile duct, gallbladder and duodenum. During surgery a biopsy sample was collected, and histologically a diagnosis of chronic cholangitis with diffuse cholestasis and periportal fibrosis was formulated. The bacterbilia was not demonstrate to cultural and cytologic exam. Any complication was revealed in postoperative time; the clinical condition, CBC and serum biochemical profile were normal during the 8 -month follow-up period. Stones usually form in the gallbladder, but sometimes they can form directly in the common bile duct or move here from the biliary tree. Multiple small stones, causing incomplete obstruction, with a major one of 1, 5 x 7 mm, {{were removed from the}} final tract of the common bile duct in this dog...|$|R
