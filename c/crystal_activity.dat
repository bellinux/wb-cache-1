The number of crystals counted by our assay were significantly higher (p<. 0005) in human neonates than in human adults, which {{may be due to the}} fact that the rate of bone turnover is significantly higher in newborns than in adults, causing a rise in neonate’s serum <b>crystal</b> formation <b>activity.</b> We found that crystals counted by our assay probably originate from the growth of much smaller crystals already present in serum and are not formed by a serum catalyst.

Mass-spectrometric and electrophoretic analyses revealed that IRS- 2 was cleaved by contaminating proteases during crystallization.

In this paper we describe the characterization of the Cry 15 Aa and 40 kDa protein's biochemical and insecticidal properties and the mode of action. Both proteins were solubilized above pH 10 in vitro. Incubation of solubilized crystal proteins with trypsin or insect midgut extracts rapidly processed the 40 kDa protein to fragments too small to be detected by SDS-PAGE, whereas the Cry 15 protein yielded a stable product of approximately 30 kDa. Protein N-terminal sequencing showed that Cry 15 processing occurs exclusively at the C-terminal end. Cry 15 protein showed in vitro hemolytic activity, which was greatly enhanced by preincubation with trypsin or insect gut extract.

Those from the early morning urine of 48 stone formers and 43 normal control subjects measured 11 and 16 μg of uronic acid/ml of urine, respectively. Preparative agarose gel electrophoresis of the recovered glycosaminoglycans in barium acetate buffer (pH 5. 8) yielded fractions containing purely chondroitin sulphate, co-polymeric chondroitin/dermatan sulphates and heparan sulphate.

Similar compositions of glycosaminoglycan classes were observed in samples from stone formers and normal control subjects. The fractionated glycosaminoglycans were dissolved in urine ultrafiltrate to assay for nucleation-promoting and growth-inhibiting activities towards crystallization of urinary calcium oxalate. When compared at the same uronic acid concentration, both the urinary chondroitin sulphate isomers and heparan sulphates of stone formers demonstrated the capacity to enhance crystal nucleation from calcium oxalate endogenous in urine ultrafiltrates, whereas only urinary heparan sulphates of normal control subjects demonstrated this capacity.
