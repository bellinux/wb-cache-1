500|$|Vipera berus, {{the common}} European adder or <b>common</b> European <b>viper,</b> is a venomous snake that is {{extremely}} widespread {{and can be}} found throughout most of Western Europe and as far as East Asia. Known by a host of common names including common adder and <b>common</b> <b>viper,</b> adders {{have been the subject of}} much folklore in Britain and other European countries. [...] They are not regarded as especially dangerous; the snake is not aggressive and usually bites only when alarmed or disturbed. Bites can be very painful, but are seldom fatal. The specific name, berus, is New Latin and was at one time used to refer to a snake, possibly the grass snake, Natrix natrix.|$|R

50|$|In Europe, the {{associated}} fauna consists of bird {{species such as}} red grouse, hen harrier, merlin, golden plover, curlew, skylark, meadow pipit, whinchat, ring ouzel, and twite. Other species dominate in moorlands elsewhere. Reptiles are few due to the cooler conditions. In Europe, only the <b>common</b> <b>viper</b> is frequent, though in other regions moorlands are commonly home to dozens of reptile species. Amphibians such as frogs are well represented in moorlands. When moorland is overgrazed, woody vegetation is often lost, being replaced by coarse, unpalatable grasses and bracken, with a greatly reduced fauna.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse most {{important}} epidemiological and clinical aspects of registered snakebites caused by a native <b>common</b> European <b>viper</b> Vipera berus in the Czech Republic over a period of 15 years (1999 – 2013). Data have been collected retrospectively from a database of the Toxinology Centre belonging to the General University Hospital in Prague. In total, 191 cases of snakebites caused by <b>common</b> <b>viper</b> were registered during the study period. Systemic envenoming occurred in 49 (25. 7 %) patients, local envenoming without systemic symptoms was recorded in 91 (47. 6 %) and asymptomatic dry bites were seen in 51 (26. 7 %) cases, respectively. Twenty-four patients (12. 6 % of all bites) were treated with administration of antivenom. None of the victims died as a result of snakebite during the observation period. Native viper snakes usually did not cause serious harm to the patients, with the exception of children. Antivenom should be administered in all cases with systemic manifestations, in children even with serious local affection and administered as soon as possible. Envenomed patients should be admitted to the hospital and treated at least under supervision of specialists with experience in snakebite treatment, who can indicate and provide administration of the antivenom...|$|R

40|$|Many {{authors have}} claimed that snakebite risk is {{associated}} with human population density, human activities, and snake behavior. Here we analyzed whether environmental suitability of vipers {{can be used as}} an indicator of snakebite risk. We tested several hypotheses to explain snakebite incidence, through the construction of models incorporating both environmental suitability and socioeconomic variables in Veracruz, Mexico. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) was used to estimate potential geographic and ecological distributions of nine viper species' in Veracruz. We calculated the distance to the species' niche centroid (DNC); this distance may be associated with a prediction of abundance. We found significant inverse relationships between snakebites and DNCs of <b>common</b> <b>vipers</b> (Crotalus simus and Bothrops asper), explaining respectively 15 % and almost 35 % of variation in snakebite incidence. Additionally, DNCs for these two vipers, in combination with marginalization of human populations, accounted for 76 % of variation in incidence. Our results suggest that niche modeling and niche-centroid distance approaches can be used to mapping distributions of environmental suitability for venomous snakes; combining this ecological information with socioeconomic factors may help with inferring potential risk areas for snakebites, since hospital data are often biased (especially when incidences are low) ...|$|R
