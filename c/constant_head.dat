40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{homing guidance}} for a vehicle {{with a single}} omnidirectional receiver traveling to a stationary, omnidirectional transmitting beacon by using spatially quantized signal strength measurements. Two homing strategies are presented, and simulations are performed for cases with signal noise and vehicle turn rate limits. The first strategy is the Oyler strategy, which adapts a sliding mode controller and observer from the previous work. The second strategy is based on <b>constant</b> <b>heading</b> changes (CHCs) each time a range increment is detected, and this strategy is shown to be sufficient for homing. This study also discusses a signal filter designed to improve the homing controllers' performance. Performance metrics are developed for strategy evaluation and parameter optimization. The performance of each guidance strategy is shown through simulations {{for a variety of}} conditions. The Oyler strategy guides the vehicle to the beacon more efficiently than the <b>constant</b> <b>heading</b> change strategy, but it comes with a slight penalty in success rate...|$|R
25|$|On one engine the Lerwick {{could not}} {{maintain}} height, nor could it maintain a <b>constant</b> <b>heading,</b> as the controls could not counter the torque of one engine on maximum power. An engine failure would inevitably see the aircraft flying in slowly descending circles. On one occasion, {{the loss of}} an engine forced a Lerwick to make an emergency landing in the Caledonian Canal. The aircraft was then towed to Oban {{at the end of}} a string of coal barges.|$|R
50|$|The single ring {{involves}} {{driving a}} ring {{into the soil}} and supplying water in the ring either at <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> or falling head condition. <b>Constant</b> <b>head</b> refers to condition where {{the amount of water}} in the ring is always held constant. Because infiltration capacity is the maximum infiltration rate, and if infiltration rate exceeds the infiltration capacity, runoff will be the consequence, therefore maintaining <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> means the rate of water supplied corresponds to the infiltration capacity. The supplying of water is done with a Mariotte's bottle. Falling head refers to condition where water is supplied in the ring, and the water is allowed to drop with time. The operator records how much water goes into the soil for a given time period. The rate of which water goes into the soil is related to the soil's hydraulic conductivity.|$|E

50|$|The astronauts {{would wait}} until the {{appropriate}} liftoff time that would put them into an orbit close to the CSM, then launch. The pilot would attempt to hold a <b>constant</b> <b>heading,</b> and at pre-determined times during the burn he would adjust the pitch to pre-determined angles.

Butcher had some impromptu stitches inserted by the physiotherapist and, swathed in bandages, continued playing. His <b>constant</b> <b>heading</b> of the ball - unavoidable when playing in the centre of defence - disintegrated the bandages and reopened the cut {{to the extent that}} his white England shirt was red with blood {{by the end of the}} game.

50|$|Another theory exists {{behind the}} cause of bobble-head doll syndrome. It states that the <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> {{movements}} create a temporary relief in intraventricular obstruction by both shifting the cyst to the posterior—away from the foramina of Monro—and a reduction in cyst size.

50|$|Mathematically, {{the process}} of {{constructing}} a flownet consists of contouring the two harmonic or analytic functions of potential and stream function. These functions both satisfy the Laplace equation and the contour lines represent lines of <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> (equipotentials) and lines tangent to flowpaths (streamlines). Together, the potential function and the stream function form the complex potential, where the potential is the real part, and the stream function is the imaginary part.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} first {{reported}} by McCarthy (1934).As {{shown in the}} diagram, a stoppered reservoir is supplied with an air inlet and a siphon. The pressure {{at the bottom of}} the air inlet is always the same as the pressure outside the reservoir, i.e. the atmospheric pressure. If it were greater, air would not enter. If the entrance to the siphon is at the same depth, then it will always supply the water at atmospheric pressure and will deliver a flow under <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> height, regardless of the changing water level within the reservoir.|$|E
50|$|An {{improperly}} performed {{slow roll}} can easily {{result in a}} change in heading. Before performing the roll, the pilot will often pick a reference point on the horizon, located just above {{the nose of the}} plane. To keep a <b>constant</b> <b>heading</b> and attitude, the pilot will usually try to hold this reference point in a constant position over the nose as the horizon rotates around it. A slow roll can easily result in the aircraft falling out of the maneuver, so the pilot will usually need to ensure that the plane has sufficient altitude to recover if such an event occurs.|$|R

The main reason for doing this is that the regular groundwater flow equation (diffusion equation) leads to singularities at <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> boundaries at very small times. This form is more mathematically rigorous, but leads to a hyperbolic groundwater flow equation, which is more difficult to solve and is only useful at very small times, typically out of the realm of practical use.|$|E
50|$|From {{the machine}} chest stock is pumped {{to a head}} tank, {{commonly}} called a head box, whose purpose is to maintain a <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> (pressure) on the stock as it feeds the basis weight valve. The head box also provides a means allowing air bubbles to escape. The basis weight valve meters the stock to the recirculating stream of water that is pumped, by the fan pump, from a whitewater chest through to the flow box. On {{the way to the}} flow box the pulp slurry may pass through centrifugal cleaners, which remove heavy contaminants like sand, and screens, which break up fibre clumps and remove over-sized debris.|$|E

50|$|In June 2013, {{he signed}} a {{contract}} with 1. FC Kaiserslautern to play in 2. Bundesliga. The clubs did not publish the transfer fee, but according to newspapers Kaiserslautern paid HJK Helsinki 500.000 Euros. After an encouraging start, and the club sacking of the first team coach Franco Foda in September 2013, he struggled to keep his position in the side. However, he was picked for the opening line-up in the cup games versus both Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern München. He scored his first goal for the club in August 2014 versus SV Sandhausen. Despite a lengthy lay-off due to a knee injury in the home game versus Fortuna Düsseldorf, the season 2014-15 turned out to be his best in Germany, with six goals in 24 league games. During the following seasons, Ring's performances were marred by minor injuries and <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> coach changes, that hindered his progress. In January 2017 the economically ailing club decided to let him move on before his contract would have expired.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{machines}} {{were made and}} placed in one building or factory. The whole process was mechanised; this style of textile production was called the factory system, the operatives had no control on the speed of production or influence on the product, they served {{the needs of the}} machines. Arkwright protected his patent and had absolute control over the use of the system. He allowed others to manufacture under licence, but only if they purchased the complete range of machines. To do so they needed plenty of initial capital and a purpose built mill, built mainly to his dimensions with a suitable power source. His patents were revoked in 1785. A watermill required a reliable steady supply of water; while this could be a river that ran at the same velocity throughout the year or a leat running from a river that provided a <b>constant</b> <b>head,</b> but more often a millpond would be built with sluices to regulate the head.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{constant}} {{rate of strain}} and <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> techniques for measurement of the hydraulic conductivity of fine grained soils. A laboratory program compares hydraulic conductivity measurements made using both measurement techniques on a total of 12 specimens. Both resedimented and intact materials covering {{a wide range of}} plasticity are investigated. Specific material types include Boston Blue Clay, San Francisco Bay Mud, Maine Clay, Ugnu Clay and Kaolinite. Constant rate of strain (CRS) and <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> tests were conducted in a standard Trautwein CRS device modified to allow control of the base pore pressure for <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> testing. A flexible wall permeameter device was used to perform <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> hydraulic conductivity testing on two specimens; this allowed for comparison with the <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> measurements made in the CRS device. A bottom seating error was found in the CRS device. Bottom seating error occurs during set up when the top of the base porous stone is not flush with the bottom of the rigid specimen ring, causing a gap to form between the specimen and the porous stone. A bottom seating error translates into a strain error, which affects both the measured CRS compression and hydraulic conductivity results. Bottom seating error can be avoided using a modified set up procedure. Void ratio errors are sometimes noted between the void ratio measured in the CRS device and that measured upon removal from the CRS device. These errors are likely resultant from specimen swelling following load removal. Based on comparison to the results of an interlaboratory study into the reproducibility of the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured in a flexible wall permeameter, the CRS and <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> techniques were found to measure the same hydraulic conductivity. This conclusion is independent of specimen origin, i. e. resedimented or intact. The CRS and <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> techniques measure the same average hydraulic conductivity even when non uniformities are present, provided the non uniformities are continuous and oriented perpendicular to the axial loading direction. by Amy Lynn Adams.

5000|$|The precise {{purpose of}} magnetoreception in animal {{navigation}} is unclear. Some animals appear {{to use their}} magnetic sense as a map, compass, or compass calibrator. The compass method allows animals not only to find north, but also to maintain a <b>constant</b> <b>heading</b> in a particular direction. Although the ability to sense direction is important in migratory navigation, many animals also {{have the ability to}} sense small fluctuations in earth’s magnetic field to compute coordinate maps with a resolution of a few kilometers or better. [...] For example, birds such as the homing pigeon are believed to use the magnetite in their beaks to detect magnetic signposts and thus, the magnetic sense they gain from this pathway is a possible map. Yet, it has also been suggested that homing pigeons and other birds use the visually mediated cryptochrome receptor as a compass.|$|R

40|$|The {{calculation}} of the discharge to a constant drawdown well or tunnel {{in the presence of}} an infinite linear <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> boundary in an ideal confined aquifer usually relies on the numerical inversion of a Laplace transform solution.

40|$|A {{borehole}} permeameter is {{well suited}} for testing saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) at specific depths in the vadose zone. Most applications of the method involve fine-grained soils that allow hand auguring of test holes and require a small water reservoir to maintain a <b>constant</b> <b>head.</b> In non-cohesive gravels, hand-dug test holes are difficult to excavate, holes are prone to collapse, and large volumes of water are necessary to maintain a <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> {{for the duration of}} the test. For coarse alluvial gravels, a direct-push steel permeameter was designed to place a slotted pipe at a specific sampling depth. Measurements can be made at successive depths at the same location. A 3790 L (1000 gallons) trailer-mounted water tank maintained a <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> in the permeameter. Head in the portable tank was measured with a pressure transducer and flow was calculated based on a volumetric rating curve. A U. S.

40|$|The use of Pervious Concrete (PC) {{increased}} {{in the last years}} as an alternative to solve the run-off problem. PC shows a high percentage of empty spaces/gaps, which vary from 10 to 35 %, facilitating the flow of rain and water through its structure. PC presents higher k permeability coefficient compared to conventional concrete. Permeability is the main property of PC, although there is no standardized method that guarantees the correct and precise measurement of such property in laboratory conditions. Currently, two main methodologies are used to assess the permeability coefficient: the falling head and the <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> permeability tests. In that regard, the American Concrete Institute recommends the use of the first method, although no comparison was done between them. Furthermore, the recommendations do not consider the use of sustainable aggregates during the production of the PC. In this study, the permeability tests were explained and used to assess the permeability coefficient of different mixes of PC produced with sustainable aggregates. The experimental results were used to analyze the relationship between the porosity and the permeability of concrete and compare the performance of the falling head and <b>constant</b> <b>head</b> permeability tests.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{generating}} provably-safe conflict resolution maneuvers for aircraft in uncertain environments. We assume that a maneuver is composed of a sequence of flight modes, which are segments of <b>constant</b> <b>heading,</b> of <b>constant</b> bank angle, or of constant airspeed. Each of these flight modes has associated to it the kinematics of the aircraft, and hence the maneuver is a hybrid system. While the flight modes are defined ahead of time, their sequencing and parameter values do not necessarily have to be. We present an algorithm for generating provably safe maneuvers, which is based on a general procedure for designing controllers for hybrid systems. The result is a maneuver, proven to be safe within the limits of the models used, which is a familiar sequence of commands easily executable by the flight management systems. The maneuvers may be viewed as protocols, or "rules of the road", and are well-defined for each conflict scenario. We present results for two example maneuvers. ...|$|R
