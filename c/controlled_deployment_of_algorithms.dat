When the capsule and tether swung through the local vertical, the tether was cut. Since the capsule was then going too slowly to stay in orbit, it has entered a trajectory to re-enter the atmosphere from an altitude of about 250 km, protected by a heat shield made of novel materials. Once it reached an altitude of 5 km, a parachute was intended to deploy to ensure a soft landing on the steppes of Kazakhstan.|$|R

The construction requires each node {{to have at least}} one neighbor in every theta (NET) angle sector of its communication range. We present analysis to show that (i) for specific values of θ, the NET condition guarantees various proximity graphs such as the relative neighborhood graph and, (ii) sensing area coverage of the resulting NET graphs can be maximized by symmetric placement of each node’s neighbors on the edges of its communication range. Algorithms for <b>controlled</b> <b>deployment</b> are presented to demonstrate how the NET condition can be integrated with positioning of nodes for desirable topology construction. Simulations establish that varying this single parameter θ can provide a wide range of coverage and connectivity tradeoffs. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—While the {{advantages}} of multicast delivery over multiple unicast deliveries is undeniable, the <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> the IP multicast protocol has been limited to “islands ” of network domains under single administrative <b>control.</b> <b>Deployment</b> <b>of</b> inter-domain multicast delivery has been slow due to both technical and administrative reasons. In this {{paper we propose a}} Host Multicast Tree Protocol (HMTP) that (1) automates the interconnection of IP-multicast enabled islands and (2) provides multicast delivery to end hosts where IP multicast is not available. With HMTP, end-hosts and proxy gateways of IP multicast-enabled islands can dynamically create shared multicast trees across different islands. Members of an HMTP multicast group self-organize into an efficient, scalable and robust multicast tree. The tree structure is adjusted periodically to accommodate changes in group membership and network topology. Simulation results show that the multicast tree has low cost, and data delivered over it experiences moderately low latency. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Neighbor-Every-Theta (NET) graphs {{are such}} that each node {{has at least one}} {{neighbor}} in every theta angle sector of its communication range. We show that for θ < π, NET graphs are guaranteed to have an edge-connectivity of at least ⌊ 2 π ⌋, even with θ an irregular communication range. Our main contribution is to show how this family of graphs can achieve tunable topology control based on a single parameter θ. Since the required condition is purely local and geometric, it allows for distributed angle-only topology control. For a static network scenario, a power control algorithm based on the NET condition is developed for obtaining k-connected topologies and shown to be significantly efficient compared to existing schemes. In <b>controlled</b> <b>deployment</b> <b>of</b> a mobile network, control over positions of nodes can be leveraged for constructing NET graphs with desired levels of network connectivity and sensing coverage. To establish this, we develop a potential fields based distributed controller and present simulation results for a large network of robots. Lastly, we extend NET graphs to 3 D and provide an efficient algorithm to check for the NET condition at each node. This algorithm can be used for implementing generic topology control algorithms in 3 D.
