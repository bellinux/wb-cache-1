40|$|Since {{percussion}} {{started to}} be a method forgotten and not trusted by many practitioners, {{the aim of the}} study was to demonstrate whether this procedure could deliver exact data if done accurately and by a practised examiner. The trial presented here included 31 healthy warm-blooded horses. Percussion of the area of <b>cardiac</b> <b>dullness</b> and then echocardiographic imaging of the same region were performed. To obtain the relevant measurement points, the 4 th and 5 th intercostal spaces (ICS) were used on the left and the 4 th ICS on the right side. On the left side, the dorsal border of <b>cardiac</b> <b>dullness</b> was determined in the 4 th ICS (1 st point). Then the ventral border of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>dullness</b> was determined at the same place (2 nd point). This was followed by the examination of the same points in the 5 th ICS (3 rd and 4 th points). The following step was to measure the distance of these points from the ventral border of the thorax, and also that between the 2 nd and the 4 th points. On the right side the same procedure was used in the 4 th ICS only. Mean values/standard errors (in cm) of absolute values of differences between percussional and echocardiographic measurements were as follow. Left side, 4 th ICS, dorsal border: 0. 8 / 0. 1; ventral border: 0. 7 / 0. 1; 5 th ICS, dorsal border: 0. 8 / 0. 1, ventral border: 0. 9 / 0. 2; right side, 4 th ICS, dorsal border: 0. 8 / 0. 2; ventral border: 0. 7 / 0. 1. Due to the close correlation between the results of the two techniques, it is reasonable to consider cardiac percussion as an integrated part of the physical examination...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{prospective}} study of 51 patients with pericardial effusion, with male to female ratio of 1. 3 : 1, {{wide range of}} age (4 to 80 years), and mean age 34. 2 Â± 17. 2. Most of the patients presented with S. O. B., cough and chest pain. General symptoms of fever, fatigability, and abdominal pain, were also noticed. The diagnosis was obvious clinically, by increased <b>cardiac</b> <b>dullness</b> and muffled heart sounds {{in the vast majority}} of patients. Chest roentgenogram and echocardiograph are the mainstay of the diagnosis. Pericardiocentesis was done for 35 patients. Tuberculosis was found to be the commonest, but not the only, cause. Followed by malignancy, rheumatological and idiopathic in order of sequence. Specific echocardiographic findings, i. e. shaggy pericardium and fibrinous strands, suggesting the likelihood of tuberculosis were noticed. Other echocardiographic finding and morphological features of aspirated fluid have no predilection to a specific etiology...|$|E
40|$|Bronchiolitis may be {{diagnosed}} {{on the basis}} of clinical signs and symptoms. In a young child, the diagnosis can be made on the clinical pattern of wheezing and hyperinflation. Clinical symptoms and signs typically start with an upper respiratory prodrome, including rhinorrhoea, low-grade fever, cough and poor feeding, followed 1 - 2 days later by tachypnoea, hyperinflation and wheeze as a consequence of airway inflammation and air trapping. The illness is generally self limiting, but may become more severe and include signs such as grunting, nasal flaring, subcostal chest wall retractions and hypoxaemia. The most reliable clinical feature of bronchiolitis is hyperinflation of the chest, evident by loss of <b>cardiac</b> <b>dullness</b> on percussion, an upper border of the liver pushed down to below the 6 th intercostal space, and the presence of a Hoover sign (subcostal recession, which occurs when a flattened diaphragm pulls laterally against the lower chest wall). Measurement of peripheral arterial oxygen saturation is useful to indicate the need for supplemental oxygen. A saturation of < 92 % at sea level and 90 % inland indicates that the child has to be admitted to hospital for supplemental oxygen. Chest radiographs are generally unhelpful and not required in children with a clear clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Blood tests are not needed routinely. Complete blood count tests have not been shown to be useful in diagnosing bronchiolitis or guiding its therapy. Routine measurement of C-reactive protein does not aid in management and nasopharyngeal aspirates are not usually done. Viral testing adds little to routine management. Risk factors in patients with severe bronchiolitis that require hospitalisation and may even cause death, include prematurity, congenital heart disease and congenital lung malformations.

5000|$|The precordium is {{naturally}} a <b>cardiac</b> area of <b>dullness.</b> During {{examination of the}} chest, the percussion note will therefore be dull. In fact, this area only gives a resonant percussion note in hyperinflation, emphysema or tension pneumothorax.|$|R
