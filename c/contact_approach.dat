40|$|Initial protein {{structural}} {{comparisons were}} sequence-based. Since amino acids that are distant {{in the sequence}} can be close in the 3 -dimensional (3 D) structure, 3 D <b>contact</b> <b>approaches</b> can complement sequence approaches. Traditional 3 D <b>contact</b> <b>approaches</b> study 3 D structures directly. Instead, 3 D structures can be modeled as protein structure networks (PSNs). Then, network approaches can compare proteins by comparing their PSNs. Network approaches may improve upon traditional 3 D <b>contact</b> <b>approaches.</b> We cannot use existing PSN approaches to test this, because: 1) They rely on naive measures of network topology. 2) They are not robust to PSN size. They cannot integrate 3) multiple PSN measures or 4) PSN data with sequence data, although this could help because the different data types capture complementary biological knowledge. We address these limitations by: 1) exploiting well-established graphlet measures via a new network approach, 2) introducing normalized graphlet measures to remove the bias of PSN size, 3) allowing for integrating multiple PSN measures, and 4) using ordered graphlets to combine the complementary PSN data and sequence data. We compare both synthetic networks and real-world PSNs more accurately and faster than existing network, 3 D <b>contact,</b> or sequence <b>approaches.</b> Our approach finds PSN patterns that may be biochemically interesting...|$|R
40|$|For {{over two}} decades {{different}} types of fabric circuits have been developed. These are fabrics with integrated electric conductors. However, a technology for contacting electronics to these circuits in a simple and reliable manner was missing. This inhibited any greater commercial success of fabric circuits as potential means to create electronics in textiles applications. This publication presents a novel <b>contacting</b> <b>approach</b> based on non conductive adhesive bonding that is both simple and very versatile concerning the choice of fabric circuit and type of electronics to be contacted. Test vehicles with two different kinds of fabric circuits were developed and exposed to different kinds of textile typical stress.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a non-contact measurement approach, based on digital photogrammetry, {{applied to the}} experimental study of the bond behavior of fiber reinforced cementitious matrix composite (FRCM) - concrete joints tested in single-lap direct shear tests. The use of digital photogrammetry techniques and traditional <b>contact</b> measurement <b>approaches</b> for determining displacement and strain are investigated and compared. The results show that measurements of strain in the fiber bundles determined using the image correlation system (ICS) correlate well with those obtained from electrical strain gauges. However, differences of 38 % to 52 % were observed between the maximum strain measured with either ICS or electrical strain gages attached to the fiber bundles and the maximum strain in the fiber bundles computed from the maximum applied load. ICS {{is also used to}} measure slip and strain of bare fiber bundles, and results show that the load distribution among fiber bundles is non-uniform. The proposed measurement approach shows higher spatial measurement resolution and increased accuracy compared to traditional <b>contact</b> <b>approaches</b> by enabling measurements in each fiber bundle and overcoming the need to attach additional elements to the tested specimen...|$|R

In contrast to ‘copying’ approaches to structural diffusion, <b>contact</b> interaction <b>approaches</b> recognise that internal and external models interact, often to produce innovation and variation. Some examples of this in possessive constructions from early English and pidgins and creoles are explored, including the question of ‘for’ and its equivalents becoming postposed including in Australian Creoles. Two theories of how adoption of structures from external sources can be staged and modified, that of Carol Myers-Scotton (the 4 -M Model) and Ross’s Metatypy model are compared with examples from possessives, as well as Aikhenvald’s treatment of possessive construction diffusion in the Amazon.
