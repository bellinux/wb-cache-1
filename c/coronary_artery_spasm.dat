Results: In 241 patients enrolled, 99 patients had <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease and the others did not.

The progression of acute cardiac inflammation to DCM is the three-phase process, including viral (cytopathic), (auto) -immunulogic, and recovery or myopathic phase. Cardiac symptoms are variable and include reduced functional ca-pacity due to dyspnoe and/or fatigue, palpitations, precordial chest pain which result from associated pericarditis or <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>spasms.</b> Diagnostic work-up in myocarditis is multistage and requires integration of clinical symptoms, laboratory and imaging data, {{all of which have}} an adjunctive role to the endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), which is final and ultimately decisive diagnostic tool.
