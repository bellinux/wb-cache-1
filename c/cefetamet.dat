40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of orally administered <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil and intravenously administered <b>cefetamet</b> {{were studied}} in 12 healthy subjects and 12 patients with hepatic cirrhosis without ascites. Cirrhosis had no detectable {{effect on the}} pharmacokinetics of <b>cefetamet</b> and on the bioavailability of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil. After intravenous <b>cefetamet</b> in control versus cirrhotic subjects, respectively, the following mean +/- standard deviation values were observed: total body clearance, 128 +/- 10. 2 versus 123 +/- 28. 8 ml/min; steady-state volume of distribution, 23. 2 +/- 2. 2 versus 22. 7 +/- 4. 6 liters; half-life, 2. 42 +/- 0. 21 versus 2. 35 +/- 0. 41 h. Renal and nonrenal clearances of <b>cefetamet</b> were similar in both groups, as were the mean residence times and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve. For oral <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil, no differences were detected in the mean values {{of the percentage of}} dose absorbed: 44. 6 +/- 9. 1 versus 50. 1 +/- 12. 9. The rate of appearance of <b>cefetamet</b> in the plasma also was not affected by cirrhosis: similar mean values were found for the mean residence time and the maximum concentration in plasma and its time of occurrence...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate the effect of advanced age on the pharmacokinetics of <b>cefetamet</b> and its prodrug, <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil. A secondary objective {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of food on the absorption of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil in the elderly. Twenty-four healthy subjects (twelve young and twelve elderly) received (in a Latin square design) a single-dose, 515 -mg infusion of <b>cefetamet,</b> a single 1, 000 -mg oral dose of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil during fasted conditions, and a single 1, 000 -mg oral dose of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil 10 min after a standardized low-fat breakfast. Serial blood and urine samples were collected over a 36 -h period and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Intravenous and oral pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained by using model-independent techniques. The systemic clearance and renal clearance of <b>cefetamet</b> were significantly lower (P less than 0. 05) in elderly subjects compared with in young controls after intravenous administration. No significant difference was observed in the apparent volumes of distribution at steady state between the two groups. Consequently, half-life and mean residence time were prolonged. A trend toward a lower renal clearance/creatinine clearance ratio was observed in our elderly population. Oral clearance of <b>cefetamet</b> was only slightly reduced in our elderly subjects, consistent with an increase in plasma half-life. Otherwise, oral pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable between elderly and young subjects. Additionally, the same effects of food were observed on the absorption characteristics of <b>cefetamet</b> (no change in maximum concentration of drug in plasma and an increase in both time to maximum concentration of drug in plasma and bioavailability) in our elderly subjects as in our young volunteers. Age did not appear to alter the deesterification and bioavailability of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil. We conclude that the small reduction in the elimination of <b>cefetamet</b> in the elderly would not require dose adjustment for this population...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the pharmacokinetics of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil and possible interaction with N-acetylcysteine and cisapride in healthy volunteers. MethodsIn a double-blind, randomized three-way crossover study with 12 healthy male volunteers, serum and urine concentrations of <b>cefetamet</b> were determined over 12 h by a validated bioassay method after oral administration of 0. 5 g <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil and, randomly, placebo, 5 × 20 mg cisapride, or 0. 6 g N-acetylcysteine. ResultsThe study medications were well tolerated, {{although there were}} 10 cases of altered bowel movements, two cases of mild, transient headache and one case of increased serum transferase levels (AST and ALT). The mean peak serum level of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil {{in the placebo group}} was 4. 86 ± 1. 35 mg/L. The urine recovery/ 24 h in the placebo group was 41. 9 ± 3. 8 % of the oral dose. The elimination half-life was 3. 56 ± 0. 92 h. N-Acetylcysteine had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil. With concomitant administration of cisapride there was an accelerated absorption of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil and a slightly increased Cmax of <b>cefetamet.</b> The Cmax values differed significantly (p < 0. 05) only between the cisapride group (5. 76 ± 1. 50 mg/L) and the N-acetylcysteine group (4. 53 ± 1. 18 mg/L). ConclusionNone of the small pharmacokinetic differences between the three groups is expected to have any relevance in the treatment of infectious diseases with <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil during {{administration of}} ascending oral doses were studied in 16 male normal healthy volunteers (age, 24. 5 +/- 2. 1 years; weight, 73. 5 +/- 8. 5 kg). The subjects {{were randomly assigned}} to four oral treatments of 500, 1, 000, 1, 500, and 2, 000 mg of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil according to a four-by-four Latin square design. After an overnight fast, the drug was administered 10 min after a standard breakfast. It was found that both the rate and extent of prodrug absorption, measured as <b>cefetamet</b> adsorption, were reduced with increasing doses. The time to maximum concentration of <b>cefetamet</b> in serum was delayed from 4. 00 +/- 0. 81 to 4. 88 +/- 0. 96 h (P less than 0. 05) when the dose of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil was increased from 500 to 2, 000 mg. The dose-normalized values of area under the curve from 0 h to infinity for <b>cefetamet</b> and fraction of dose excreted as <b>cefetamet</b> were reduced by averages of 10. 3 and 12. 5 %, respectively, over the dose range studied (P less than 0. 05). The changes in rate and extent of prodrug absorption are thought to be the main factors contributing to the nonlinear relationship between maximum concentration in serum and dose. The change in absorption characteristics of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil with dose is, however, expected to have few clinical consequences because the magnitudes of these changes are comparable with their respective intragroup variations...|$|E
40|$|The {{penetration}} of <b>cefetamet</b> and cefuroxime into the maxillary sinus mucosa after {{the administration of}} <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil and cefuroxime axetil was investigated in patients undergoing elective surgery of the maxillary sinus. A total of 27 patients, 13 for <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil and 14 for cefuroxime axetil, ranging from 15 to 70 years of age participated in this study. Each patient received three oral doses of either one tablet of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil (500 mg of GLOBOCEF) or two film tablets of cefuroxime axetil (125 and 250 mg of ZINAT) every 12 h. Sinus mucosa tissue samples were removed during surgery at times ranging from 2 to 4. 5 h after the last oral administration. Blood samples were collected before drug administration, 2 h after {{the first and third}} doses, and concomitantly with tissue sample collection during surgery. All samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentrations of <b>cefetamet</b> and cefuroxime in plasma samples measured concomitantly with those in tissue samples ranged between 0. 83 and 4. 5 micrograms/ml for <b>cefetamet</b> and 0. 59 and 3 micrograms/ml for cefuroxime. The mean tissue-to-plasma ratios calculated with reference to total (bound plus unbound) plasma drug concentrations were 0. 60 (range, 0. 52 to 0. 77) for <b>cefetamet</b> (n = 4) and 0. 38 (range, 0. 28 to 0. 44) for cefuroxime (n = 6). Both drugs seem to penetrate freely and easily into the sinus mucosa. The antibacterial activities of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil and cefuroxime axetil in cases of sinusitis therefore depend mainly on their achieved active plasma drug concentrations and their intrinsic activities in inhibiting the causative organism(s) ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cefetamet</b> pivoxil (Ro 15 - 8075) is a newly developed, expanded-spectrum {{cephalosporin}} that is orally active. In vitro, {{the active}} form, <b>cefetamet</b> (Ro 15 - 8074), at {{a concentration of}} 0. 05 micrograms/ml killed and lysed Treponema pallidum. Rabbit serum did not diminish its effectiveness. The antibiotic rapidly entered the circulation following intramuscular injection into rabbits, attaining its highest levels of 24 to 37 micrograms/ml within 10 to 30 min. Animals were infected intradermally with T. pallidum and then treated with different doses of <b>cefetamet.</b> Accelerated healing was detected following treatment with 15 and 30 mg/kg of body weight. The antibiotic was also effective in killing organisms that had disseminated to distant tissues. In three separate sets of experiments, rabbits were infected with treponemes and then treated with <b>cefetamet</b> intramuscularly at 1, 15, or 30 mg/kg as follows: (i) after lesions had just become clinically apparent, (ii) after lesions were enlarged and well developed, or (iii) prior to the appearance of clinical lesions. Antibiotic effectiveness was determined by sacrificing the animals 1 week after antibiotic treatment and examining splenic tissue for residual, disseminated treponemes. <b>Cefetamet</b> was treponemicidal in all three situations. Maximum effects occurred when the antibiotic was injected before lesions had become clinically apparent (incubation period). These results suggest that <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil might be useful for treating syphilitic infections...|$|E

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefetamet</b> {{were determined}} after intravenous (i. v.) administration of <b>cefetamet</b> and oral administration of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil syrup to patients {{between the ages}} of 3 and 12 years. The patients were hospitalized for reconstructive urological surgery; to prevent infection, prophylactic i. v. <b>cefetamet</b> was administered on the day of surgery and oral <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil was administered 2 days later. After i. v. administration, the mean (+/- standard deviation) half-life of <b>cefetamet</b> was 1. 97 +/- 0. 60 h (n = 18), which was different from the 2. 46 +/- 0. 33 h reported for nine adults (22 to 68 years old) in a previous study. The average values for the mean residence times were 2. 35 +/- 0. 94 and 2. 83 +/- 0. 34 h and the average values for the fraction of the dose eliminated unchanged in the urine were 79. 9 % +/- 8. 99 % and 80 % +/- 11 % in children and adults, respectively. Plots of mean systemic clearance and steady-state volume of distribution versus body weight for the children and comparative adults were linear on log-log coordinates, and the slopes of the plots were 0. 661 and 0. 880, respectively. These slope values suggested that mean systemic clearance values per unit of body surface area were similar in children and adults and that maintenance doses for children should be the adult maintenance dose multiplied by the child's surface area divided by 1. 73 m 2. The mean (+/- standard deviation) oral bioavailabilities of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil were 49. 3 % +/- 15. 7 % in 3 - to 7 -year-old children who received a 500 -mg dose and 37. 9 % +/- 10. 0 % in 8 - to 12 -year-old children who received a 1, 000 -mg dose. These values were not different from that observed in the adult group after two 500 -mg tablets. Likewise, the peak concentration of <b>cefetamet</b> in plasma and its time of occurrence in children were in line with the values which have been observed for adults...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to assess the influence that treatment with antacid and ranitidine had on the pharmacokinetics of oral <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil in 18 healthy male volunteers. Each subject received, in an open-labeled, randomized, three-way crossover design, a single oral dose of 1, 000 mg (two tablets) of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil 10 min after a standard breakfast during each of the following treatments: treatment A, control period; treatment B, antacid (80 ml of suspension; Maalox 70) administered on the evening before <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil dosing (- 12. 5 h) and again 2 h before and 2 h after a standard breakfast; treatment C, ranitidine (150 mg) administered twice a day for 4 days and again 1 h and 10 min prior to <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil dosing. Plasma and urine samples were collected over a 24 -h period following <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil administration. <b>Cefetamet</b> was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Oral bioavailability parameters (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h, area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity, time to maximum concentration of drug in plasma, and maximum concentration of drug in plasma) were obtained by noncompartmental techniques. The results showed that none of these bioavailability parameters was significantly (P greater than 0. 05) affected by antacid or rantidine coadministration. A compartmental analysis showed no significant differences. In addition, the terminal elimination half-life and the fraction of <b>cefetamet</b> excreted unchanged in the urine was also not significantly (P greater than 0. 05) affected by antacid or ranitidine exposure. Relatively wide intrasubject variability was observed for time to maximum concentration of drug in plasma and terminal elimination half-life in several of the 18 subjects studied. Although these irregularities {{did not appear to be}} strongly associated with a particular treatment, they increased in subjects in both the antacid and H 2 -receptor antagonist treatment groups compared with those in subjects in the control treatment group. We conclude that antacid and ranitidine treatment likely does not alter the bioavailability of oral <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil...|$|E

40|$|<b>Cefetamet</b> pivoxil (1, 000 mg orally) {{absorption}} {{was evaluated}} in 16 male subjects (age, 23. 4 +/- 1. 7 years; weight, 73. 9 +/- 7. 0 kg) 1 h before (BE), with (WI), and 1 h after (AF) a standard breakfast. The time to peak concentration of <b>cefetamet</b> in plasma (Tmax) was increased from 3. 25 +/- 1. 44 h in the BE group to 4. 31 +/- 1. 54 and 4. 13 +/- 1. 54 h in the WI and AF groups, respectively (P less than 0. 05). The maximum <b>cefetamet</b> concentration in plasma (Cmax) {{and the area}} under the plasma <b>cefetamet</b> concentration-time profiles (AUC) in the BE, WI, and AF groups were 5. 50 +/- 1. 06, 5. 47 +/- 1. 4, and 6. 57 +/- 0. 93 micrograms/ml and 38. 2 +/- 10. 1, 35. 7 +/- 11. 9, and 42. 8 +/- 6. 8 micrograms. h/ml, respectively. The Cmax and AUC values were not different between the BE and WI groups (P greater than 0. 05). However, differences in these values {{were found between the}} WI and AF groups (P less than 0. 05). The effect of fluid volume intake on <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil (1, 000 mg orally) absorption was evaluated in 12 male subjects (age, 23. 8 +/- 2. 3 years; weight, 74. 9 +/- 9. 0 kg) under fasted and WI conditions. Increasing fluid volume intake from 250 to 450 ml under the fasted condition had no effect on the absorption of the prodrug (Tmax, 2. 50 +/- 0. 52 versus 2. 83 +/- 0. 94 h; Cmax, 4. 89 +/- 1. 04 versus 4. 84 +/- 0. 89 micrograms/ml; AUC, 29. 6 +/- 5. 1 versus 30. 7 +/- 7. 1 micrograms. h/ml; P greater than 0. 05.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of intravenous (i. v.) <b>cefetamet</b> and the bioavailability of oral <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil {{in infants}} aged 3. 5 to 17. 3 months who were hospitalized for urological surgery were characterized. The absorption of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil administered in a syrup formulation was 38 +/- 19 % (n = 5) for infants, which was comparable to values observed {{for children and}} adults. The plasma half-life of i. v. <b>cefetamet</b> was 3. 03 +/- 0. 96 h (mean +/- standard deviation; n = 20) in the infants. This was not different from the value observed for normal adult subjects but was longer than that reported for children aged 3 to 12 years. Urinary recovery of <b>cefetamet</b> after i. v. administration to infants was 63. 4 +/- 17. 7 % (n = 16), which was less than the 80 % recovery found in older children and adults. The steady-state volume of distribution was 399 +/- 116 ml/kg of body weight. It was comparable in size and showed the same dependence on body weight {{as it did in}} children and adults. The mean systemic clearance per kilogram of body weight in the infants was lower than that in children and adults, apparently because of immaturity of clearance processes. A model that accounted for maturation and growth with increasing age was developed for the clearance. On the basis of this model, the clearance capacity increased from birth to 5 years by a factor of 4. 5 because of maturation. Maturation progressed exponentially, with a half-life of 14 months.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} three pharmacokinetic studies of <b>cefetamet</b> and <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil conducted in normal adult male volunteers. In the first study the pharmacokinetics of <b>cefetamet</b> were evaluated after intravenous infusion of doses ranging from 133 to 2, 650 mg. Over this dose range, the pharmacokinetics were linear. A dose-proportional increase in the area under the curve from zero to infinity was observed, whereas total clearance (140. 3 +/- 23. 6 ml/min), renal clearance (130. 3 +/- 18. 2 ml/min), volume of distribution at steady state (0. 288 +/- 0. 023 liter/kg), fraction excreted unchanged in the urine (94 +/- 11 %), and elimination half-life (2. 07 +/- 0. 18 h) were independent of dose. In a second study the absolute bioavailability of single 1, 500 -mg doses of a tablet formulation of the pivaloyloxymethylester of <b>cefetamet</b> was evaluated under conditions of fasting and after a standard breakfast. Administration with food increased the extent of absorption (from 31 +/- 7 to 44 +/- 4 %) while decreasing the rate of absorption (time to maximum concentration of drug in plasma increased from 3. 0 +/- 0. 6 to 4. 8 +/- 0. 4 h). The third study consisted of multiple oral administration of 1, 000 mg of a similar oral tablet formulation twice daily for 10 days.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefetamet</b> {{after a short}} intravenous {{infusion of}} <b>cefetamet</b> (515 mg) and oral administration of 1, 000 mg of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil were studied in 9 healthy subjects and in 38 patients with various degrees of renal impairment. The results showed that <b>cefetamet</b> elimination was dependent on renal function. After intravenous dosing, total body (CLS), renal (CLR), and nonrenal (CLNR) clearances were linearly related to creatinine clearance (CLCR; r = 0. 95, 0. 92, and 0. 59, respectively). Elimination half-life (t 1 / 2 beta) was prolonged from 2. 46 +/- 0. 33 h in normal subjects to 29. 1 +/- 13. 9 h in patients with CLCR of less than 10 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2. Correspondingly, CLS and CLR decreased from 1. 77 +/- 0. 27 and 1. 42 +/- 0. 25 ml/min per kg to 0. 14 +/- 0. 04 and 0. 04 +/- 0. 03 ml/min per kg, respectively. The volume of distribution at steady state (0. 298 +/- 0. 049 liter/kg) for <b>cefetamet</b> was not altered by renal insufficiency (P greater than 0. 05). After oral administration, the elimination parameters, t 1 / 2 beta and CLR, were insignificantly different from the intravenous data (P greater than 0. 05). Furthermore, the bioavailability (F) of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil (45 +/- 13 %) was not altered by renal failure (P greater than 0. 05). However, maximum concentration in plasma and the time to achieve this value were significantly increased (5. 86 +/- 0. 74 versus 14. 8 +/- 6. 14 micrograms/ml and 3. 9 +/- 1. 1 versus 8. 4 +/- 1. 7 h, respectively; P less than 0. 05). Based on these observations, {{it is recommended that}} patients with CLcr of < 10 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 and between 10 and 39 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 be given one-quarter of the normal daily dose either once or twice daily.

40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for {{the determination of}} <b>cefetamet</b> in plasma was developed. The method employs cefatoxime sodium as internal standard. Separation of the drug from plasma was achieved after precipitation of plasma protein with 3 % perchloric acid followed by reversed phase chromatography on a 5 μm C- 18 absorbosphere column with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile-water (40 : 60 %, v/v) {{with the addition of}} 1 ml glacial acetic acid for each 500 ml of mobile phase, pumped isocratically at flow rate of 1. 7 ml/min.

A linear relationship was obtained between ratio of the peak height of the drug to that of the internal standard versus the concentration of the drug. The detection limit for determination of <b>cefetamet</b> in plasma is 100 ng/ml. Within-day coefficients of variation (CV) ranged from 1. 1 to 2. 7 % and between day CV varied from 2 to 5. 48 %.

40|$|Several multilaboratory {{studies to}} {{determine}} quality control (QC) ranges {{for a variety}} of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) susceptibility tests are summarized. Replicate testing used multiple lots of media and antimicrobial disks in accordance with NCCLS recommendations, including the appropriate medium modifications for tests with Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. QC ranges for MIC and disk diffusion testing of N. gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 were proposed for cefepime, <b>cefetamet,</b> cefmetazole, and cefpodoxime. Disk diffusion QC ranges for Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247 or ATCC 49766 were recommended with cefepime, <b>cefetamet</b> (10 - and 30 -microgram disks), cefmetazole, cefpodoxime, and cefprozil. Disk diffusion QC ranges for Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 with cefdinir and clinafloxacin and those for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 with clinafloxacin were also proposed...|$|E
40|$|More than 250 Providencia strains {{isolated}} from the urine of institutionalized elderly patients were tested against cefaclor, cefuroxime, <b>cefetamet,</b> cefpodoxime, ciprofloxacin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Our results confirm the strong activities of expanded-spectrum oral cephalosporins against Providencia isolates, f 1 p 4 ell as the marked differences in susceptibilities among accurately identified Providencia species...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} 300 {{strains of}} Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 100 strains of Haemophilus ducreyi {{to determine their}} in vitro susceptibility to two new cephalosporins, <b>cefetamet</b> (Ro 15 - 8074) and ceftetrame (Ro 19 - 5247; T- 2588), and a new fluroquinolone, fleroxacin (Ro 23 - 6240; AM- 833). Their activity was {{compared with that of}} ceftriaxone, penicillin, spectinomycin, tetracycline, and erythromycin. <b>Cefetamet,</b> ceftetrame, and fleroxacin had excellent in vitro activity against both groups of microorganisms. beta-Lactamase production did not significantly affect the MICs of these agents. The Mtr phenotype of N. gonorrhoeae raised the MICs two- to fourfold, but the MICs remained within the range of achievable levels in serum. These newer compounds have a distinct advantage over existing therapeutic agents in that they can be administered orally. Clinical trials are warranted to assess their usefulness in the therapy of gonorrhea and chancroid...|$|E
40|$|The electroreduction of <b>cefetamet</b> (CEF) using {{gold and}} {{platinum}} electrodes {{has been investigated}} in slightly alkaline medium (pH 8. 40) where adsorption, previously observed at mercury electrode, was pronounced.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of amoxicillin, cefuroxime, ceftetrame, <b>cefetamet,</b> cefixime, tigemonam, erythromycin, roxithromycin, and dirithromycin against 30 clinical isolates of Campylobacter pylori {{were determined by}} an agar dilution technique. Roxithromycin and amoxicillin (MICs for 90 % of isolates tested, 0. 01 and 0. 06 micrograms/ml, respectively) were the most active antibiotics tested, but all strains were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested...|$|E
40|$|Three {{members of}} the tribe Proteeae (Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii) were tested against five newer orally {{administered}} cephalosporins (cefdinir, cefprozil, cefuroxime, <b>cefetamet,</b> and loracarbef) by the disk diffusion and reference broth microdilution methods. One hundred strains of these organisms were tested to confirm the excessive interpretive error rates that previously had been noted for the disk diffusion test. The {{results indicate that the}} suggested disk diffusion breakpoints for <b>cefetamet</b> and cefuroxime were without serious interpretive errors. In contrast, loracarbef, cefdinir, and cefprozil results exceeded acceptable interpretive error rates, with very major (false-susceptible) errors of 4, 5, and 9 % respectively. Loracarbef currently has a warning in the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards table footnotes addressing this problem. We recommend including cefdinir and cefprozil in the list of compounds requiring this warning. In addition, MICs of cefazolin, cefaclor, and cephalothin were determined to establish whether a class MIC concept to predict susceptibility for these agents was possible. When the indole-positive Proteus strains are tested, cefazolin MICs can be used to predict MICs of all tested orally administered cephems (8 to 13 % total errors, with only a 0 to 1 % very major error...|$|E
40|$|Of six new oral cephalosporins, {{cefixime}} and cefpodoxime {{were the}} most active (MIC for 90 % of isolates tested [MIC 90], 16 micrograms/ml) against Bordetella pertussis, followed by <b>cefetamet,</b> cefprozil, and loracarbef (LY 163892) (MIC 90, 64 micrograms/ml) and ceftibuten (MIC 90, 128 micrograms/ml). Against Bordetella parapertussis, loracarbef was more active (MIC 90, 32 micrograms/ml) than the other compounds tested (MIC 90 s, 64 to greater than 128 micrograms/ml). The new oral cephalosporins are unlikely {{to play a role}} in pertussis treatment...|$|E
40|$|Two new {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} colorimetric methods were {{developed for the}} analysis of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil hydrochloride in bulk and in pharmaceutical formulations. In the first proposed method, colour of newly formed complex was measured at 645 nm (&# 955; max), and the calibration curve was linear in the range of 1 - 7 &# 956;g/ml; while in the second method, intensity of colour was measured at 524 nm (&# 955; max), and the calibration curve was linear in the range of 2 - 18 mg/ml.

40|$|Cefdinir (FK 482), <b>cefetamet</b> (Ro 15 - 8074), CI- 960, fleroxacin, lomefloxacin, and {{temafloxacin}} have potent activities against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. They {{were tested}} in a multilaboratory study to establish quality control guidelines. Quality control ranges for N. gonorrhoeae ATCC 49226 were determined by using multiple GC agar lots, three disk lots, {{and a number of}} test replicates consistent with the M 23 -T guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The MIC ranges included 2 to 4 log 2 dilution steps. The recommended inhibition zone diameter ranges were generally 7 to 8 mm and included {{greater than or equal to}} 91. 3 % of all recorded study results...|$|E
40|$|A multilaboratory {{study was}} {{performed}} to establish broth microdilution MIC quality control (QC) guidelines for 10 investigational drugs which previously demonstrated significant activity against Haemophilus influenzae. MIC QC ranges for H. influenzae ATCC 49247 with Haemophilus test medium were determined by using multiple contemporary lots of Haemophilus test medium and the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards' recommended numbers of replicate tests. On {{the basis of these}} results, QC ranges (generally modal MIC +/- one log 2 dilution) are proposed for cefdinir, cefepime, <b>cefetamet,</b> cefpirome, ceftibuten, fleroxacin, temafloxacin, clarithromycin, RP 59500, and trospectomycin. The proposed QC guidelines for clarithromycin and temafloxacin were recently accepted by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards...|$|E
40|$|Two studies {{examining}} the bioavailability of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil in healthy male subjects were conducted. In the first, the bioavailabilities of the 250 -mg (M 250) and M 500 tablet formulations of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil to be marketed {{were compared with}} that of a tablet used in clinical trials. All products were given with food at a dose of 500 mg. In the second study, the bioavailability of the syrup formulation was evaluated under both fasting and nonfasting conditions and {{compared with that of}} the M 500 tablet formulation given with food. The absolute bioavailabilities of the M 500 and M 250 tablets (55. 0 % + ± 8. 0 % and 55. 7 % ± 7. 0 %, respectively) were not significantly {{different from that of the}} clinical-trial formulation (49. 8 % ± 8. 5 %). The newer tablet formulations exhibited faster absorption as evidenced by higher peak concentrations (3. 8 [M 5001 and 3. 9 [M 2501 mg/liter compared with 3. 2 mg/liter for the clinical-trial formulation), a shorter time to peak concentration, and a shorter mean absorption time. The syrup formulation was found to have significantly lower absolute bioavailability (37. 9 %o + 6. 0 %o) compared with that of the M 500 tablet (58. 4 % + 9. 0 %) when both were given with food. Food had no significant effect on the bioavailability of the syrup, which averaged 34. 0 %o ± 8. 6 % under fasting conditions, although absorption was delayed by food (mean absorption time increased from 2. 2 to 3. 9 h). This contrasts with the results of previous studies documenting significant increases in tablet bioavailability with food. Despite the lower bioavailability of the syrup, unbound-cefetame...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{epidemiology}} of 109 cases of gonococcal infections (105 males with urethritis and 4 females with cervicitis), {{together with the}} basic and clinical effects of <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxil in the cases. The peak of age distribution of the male patients was in the younger half of their twenties, {{and all of the}} 4 female cases were between 20 and 39 years old. The major source of infections in the males younger than 25 years old was their girl friends or so-called pick-up friends, and that of the males older than 25 years old workers serving at an amusement center, for example, bars and so-called special massage parlor, which accounted for about three fourths of the male cases between 35 and 44 years old. The distribution of the MIC (inoculum size; 10 (6) CFU/ml) of <b>Cefetamet</b> against beta-lactamase non penicillinase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae (non-PPNG) ranged from 0. 025 to 0. 1 microgram/ml and that against beta-lactamase producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0. 025 to 0. 05 microgram/ml. The isolation rate of PPNG was 10. 2 % (9 / 88). In male patients with gonococcal urethritis, the efficacy rate was 100 % on days 3 and 7 for 1, 000 mg single dose and 7 -day treatment and 500 mg single dose treatment. One of the cases treated with 250 mg single dose therapy was unchanged at 3, but the efficacy rate of the remaining cases was 100 % at day 7. Complicated urethritis with C. trachomatis was noticed in 25. 7 % (5 / 105) of the male urethritis and in 25. 0 % (1 / 4) of the female cervicitis cases. The only side effect was diarrhea observed in 1 of the 124 case (0. 8 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{parameters of}} cefixime were determined in healthy volunteers following oral administration of 200 mg cefixime as tablet, syrup and dry suspension, respectively. All three galenic formulations showed reliable absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations amounted to 2. 4 - 3. 4 mg/l and were reached after 3. 3 - 3. 5 h. Mean terminal half-lives were 2. 9 - 3. 1 h. The mean areas under the plasma concentration-time curves ranged between 18 and 26 mg/l. h; 18 - 24 % of the dose administered were recovered unchanged in the urine. The best bioavailability was obtained with the dry suspension {{followed by the}} tablet and the syrup. With respect to the ester pro-drug cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil, <b>cefetamet</b> pivoxyl and cefotiam hexetil, cefixime exhibits higher plasma half-life and area under the curve as well as, comparable absolute bioavailability but consistently lower urinary recovery which indicates higher non-renal clearance...|$|E
