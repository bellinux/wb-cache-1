In 1898, Clawson was {{appointed}} to the church’s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the second highest ecclesiastical body in the church, a position he held until his death in 1943. Clawson’s high profile life in Utah, and among Mormons generally, gave opportunity for commentators to look to the events in his life that may have shaped his faith in a God and his commitment to the church. He was regularly asked {{to tell the story of}} Standing’s death, and references were made to the event by church leaders in conferences of the church for decades.

Two triangles collide essentially only when they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> by a plane going through three vertices. That is, if the triangles are [...] and [...] where each [...] is a vector in , then we can take three vertices, , find a plane going through all three vertices, and check to see if this is a separating plane. If any such plane is a separating plane, then the triangles are deemed to be disjoint. On the other hand, if none of these planes are separating planes, then the triangles are deemed to intersect. There are twenty such planes.|$|E

30|$|One {{basic concept}} {{common to all}} {{interaction}} parameters {{is that they can}} only be measured based on an interaction between a system and at least one user – for example during a laboratory or field test. The interaction is thus influenced by system and user characteristics and behaviour. As these aspects are interrelated they <b>can</b> usually <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated.</b> Consequently, interaction parameters will reflect not only the interaction but also the characteristics of the interlocutor. The requirements for recording interaction parameters are therefore similar to the ones applicable for experimental evaluation (cf.
