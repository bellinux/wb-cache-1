5|$|In the North Pacific, {{the longest}} {{reported}} were three 22.9m (75ft) males, two <b>caught</b> off California between 1919 and 1926 {{and the other}} <b>caught</b> off Alaska in 1925, and a 24.7m (81ft) female also <b>caught</b> off California, while the longest reliably measured were a 21m (69ft) male <b>caught</b> off British Columbia in 1959 and a 22.9m (75ft) female <b>caught</b> off central California between 1959 and 1970. Whales historically seen in Yellow Sea could have been distinct from outer Pacific populations due to their smaller size of around 20m or more at near maximum, and breeding season in these regions was mainly in winter.|$|E
5|$|Weinke's {{favorite}} {{target was}} game MVP Peter Warrick, but several other Seminoles also benefited from Weinke's passing efficiency. Ron Dugans <b>caught</b> five passes for 99yards and two touchdowns, Minnis <b>caught</b> two passes for 25yards, and Minor <b>caught</b> two for 23yards. For Virginia Tech, Davis <b>caught</b> seven passes for 108yards and a touchdown, Hawkins <b>caught</b> two passes for 49yards, and Kendrick <b>caught</b> two passes for 27yards.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{are one of}} {{the most}} commercially {{important}} squid species, and are widely consumed as human food. They are usually <b>caught</b> in large numbers by trawling, seine fishing, or fixed net traps. In small-scale fishing, they are <b>caught</b> by jigging, drive-in nets, slingshot-driven spearguns, or with squid pots.|$|E
5|$|Boston College wide {{receiver}} Rich Gunnell was the game's leading receiver, having {{been the primary}} beneficiary of Davis' prolific passing. Gunnell finished the game having <b>caught</b> seven passes for 114 yards and one touchdown. Virginia Tech {{wide receiver}} Dyrell Roberts was the game's second-leading receiver. He <b>caught</b> four passes for 44 yards. Tech's second-most proficient receiver was running back Darren Evans, who <b>caught</b> three passes for 22 yards. Evans was the game's leading rusher, having carried the ball 31 times for 114 yards and a touchdown. On the opposite side, Boston College running back Montel Harris led the Eagles {{on the ground with}} nine carries for 34 yards.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo's {{offensive}} {{performance was}} {{in some ways the}} opposite of Connecticut's: while UConn dominated on the ground and barely passed the ball, Buffalo struggled with the run but had a good day passing. The Bulls ran for a total of 24yards on the game; James Starks accounted for 25yards on thirteencarries and scored a touchdown, while RB Brandon Termilus ran threetimes for fiveyards. Their total was partially offset by Drew Willy, who lost sixyards on three rushing attempts. Willy had a much more successful day passing, completing 29 out of 43passes for 213yards and oneinterception. Namaan Roosevelt led the Buffalo receivers with 90yards on eightcatches; of the five other Bulls who received passes, WR Brett Hamlin <b>caught</b> fourpasses for 54yards, TE Jesse Rack <b>caught</b> three for 22yards, RB Starks <b>caught</b> 11 for 21yards, WR Ernest Jackson <b>caught</b> two for 17yards, and WR Gary Rice <b>caught</b> one for 9yards.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas is fished on a {{small scale}} in the {{north-east}} Atlantic Ocean, with approximately 1200tonnes being <b>caught</b> annually, mostly in France and the United Kingdom. In the northwest Atlantic, C.maenas was the subject of fishery in the 1960s, and again since 1996, with up to 86 tonnes being <b>caught</b> annually.|$|E
5|$|Cancel or {{reschedule}} outdoor events (to {{avoid being}} <b>caught</b> outdoors when a storm hits).|$|E
5|$|Cancer pagurus {{is heavily}} {{exploited}} commercially throughout its range, {{being the most}} commercially important crab species in Western Europe. The crabs are <b>caught</b> using crab pots (similar to lobster pots) which are placed offshore and baited. The catch of C. pagurus has increased steadily, rising from 26,000tonnes in 1978 to 60,000t in 2007, of which more than 70% was <b>caught</b> around the British Isles. The fishery is widely dispersed around the British and Irish coasts, and C. pagurus {{is thought to be}} overfished across much of this area. Most of the edible crabs <b>caught</b> by the British fleet are exported live for sale in France and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Casey's {{favorite}} {{target was}} wide receiver Sidney Snell, who <b>caught</b> a Tech-record eight touchdown receptions {{during the regular}} season. Snell accounted for 568 yards on 43 receptions of all types. Tight end Rob Purdham only <b>caught</b> seven passes during the regular season, but four of the catches were for touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|In October 2006, Iceland's {{fisheries}} ministry {{authorized the}} hunting of 9 fin whales through August 2007. In 2009 and 2010, Iceland <b>caught</b> 125 and 148 fin whales, respectively. An Icelandic company, Hvalur, <b>caught</b> {{over a hundred}} fin whales in 2014, and exported a record quantity of 2071 tonnes in a single shipment in 2014. Since 2006, Hvalur has <b>caught</b> more than 500 fin whales and exported more than 5000 tonnes of whale meat to Japan.|$|E

5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, Japan permits annual takes of 10 fin whales {{under its}} Antarctic Special Permit whaling {{program for the}} 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 seasons. The {{proposal}} for 2007–2008 and the subsequent 12 seasons allows taking 50 per year. While 10 fin whales were <b>caught</b> in the 2005–06 season and three in the 2006–07 season, none was <b>caught</b> in the 2007–2008 season. A single fin whale was <b>caught</b> in both the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons, two were taken in the 2010–11 season, and one was taken in the 2011–12 season.|$|E
5|$|Large {{fish are}} <b>caught</b> with the bill-tip, then tossed {{up in the}} air to be <b>caught</b> and slid into the gullet head-first. A gull will {{sometimes}} stand on the pelican's head, peck it to distraction, and grab a fish from the open bill. Pelicans in their turn sometimes snatch prey from other waterbirds.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{compiled}} 456yards {{of total}} offense: 198in {{the air and}} 258yards on the ground. Quarterback Chris Turner completed passes to five receivers during the game: Ronnie Tyler (five), Darrius Heyward-Bey (four), Torrey Smith (two), Adrian Cannon (one), and Emani Lee-Odai (one).

For Virginia Tech, running back Ken Oxendine led all Hokie rushers with 39 yards on 10 carries.|$|E
5|$|Other risks {{associated}} with the crinoline were that it could get <b>caught</b> in other people's feet, carriage wheels or furniture, or be <b>caught</b> by sudden gusts of wind, blowing the wearer off their feet. In 1859, while participating in a paper chase, Louisa, Duchess of Manchester, <b>caught</b> her hoop while climbing over a stile, and was left with the entirety of her crinoline and skirts thrown over her head, revealing her scarlet drawers to the assembled company.|$|E

5|$|Taylor's {{favorite}} passing {{targets were}} wide receiver Danny Coale, who finished the game having <b>caught</b> three passes for 52 yards, and tight end Greg Boone, who <b>caught</b> 3 balls for 41 yards. On the Bearcats' {{side of the}} field, Cincinnati's Mardy Gilyard led all receivers with 7 catches for 158 yards and a touchdown. Gilyard's receiving total was his best {{of the season and}} set a new Cincinnati bowl-game record.

Fellow Cincinnati receiver Dominick Goodman <b>caught</b> 6 passes for 51 yards, in the process becoming Cincinnati's all-time leader in career receiving yards.|$|E
5|$|The {{milk shark}} is {{harmless}} to humans {{because of its}} small size and teeth. <b>Caught</b> using longlines, gillnets, trawls, and hook-and-line, this shark is marketed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, and is also used for shark fin soup and fishmeal. Its abundance makes it a significant component of artisanal and commercial fisheries across its range. Off northern Australia, it ranks among the most common sharks <b>caught</b> in trawls, and comprises 2% and 6% of the annual gillnet and longline catches, respectively. This species {{is also one of}} the most commercially important sharks <b>caught</b> off Senegal, Mauritania, Oman, and India. Some sport fishers regard it as a game fish.|$|E

5|$|The next night, Sasha {{realizes that}} she has {{feelings}} for Tigerstar, and misses a rabbit while being <b>caught</b> up in her thoughts. Turning around she sees that Tigerstar had <b>caught</b> it for her, criticizes her hunting technique, and tells her she needs someone to show her how to hunt properly. When Sasha asks who would teach her, {{he says that he}} might.|$|E
5|$|Things {{changed when}} Ivan Basso's team came {{forward on the}} third climb {{of the day to}} set a much faster pace in the peloton, and Basso himself {{attacked}} and came free, with only Stefano Garzelli holding his wheel. They <b>caught</b> some members of the morning breakaway, as that group also splintered, but were eventually themselves <b>caught.</b> Danilo Di Luca launched an attack on the fourth climb of the day, and for a time he and Menchov were clear of the other GC contenders, but they were also <b>caught</b> — the top seven in the GC were unchanged after this stage.|$|E
5|$|Timid and {{harmless}} to humans, the smalleye hammerhead is <b>caught</b> incidentally by inshore artisanal {{multispecies fisheries}} throughout its range, and marketed as food. It {{is the most}} or second-most important shark <b>caught</b> by such fisheries off Trinidad, Guyana, and Brazil. Because of its head shape, individuals of all ages are readily <b>caught</b> in gillnets; small numbers are also <b>caught</b> on line gear and in bottom trawls. The IUCN has assessed this species as vulnerable, as it is subjected to intense fishing pressure and its low reproductive rate renders it susceptible to population depletion. Anecdotal evidence suggests that smalleye hammerhead catches have declined significantly off Trinidad and northern Brazil, which are likely indicative of population trends {{in the rest of}} its range. It is not the target of any conservation or management schemes.|$|E
5|$|Wide {{receivers}} Rod Gardner and Jackie Robinson {{were the}} No. 1 and No. 3 recipients, respectively, of Dantzler's passes. Gardner <b>caught</b> 51 passes for 956 yards and six touchdowns. Robinson, {{unrelated to the}} baseball player of the same name, <b>caught</b> 24 passes for 276 yards and three touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|A large {{reason for}} Alabama's success passing the ball {{came from the}} {{emergence}} of freshman quarterback Andrew Zow, who assumed starting duties during the season.

One of his favorite passing targets was Alexander, who <b>caught</b> 26 passes for 385 {{yards and four touchdowns}} in addition to his 1,178 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. Alexander averaged 116 yards per game on the ground. Wide receiver Quincy Jackson was the team's leading passing target. He <b>caught</b> 48 passes for 621 yards four touchdowns.

He <b>caught</b> 34 passes for 403 yards and four touchdowns in addition to performing kick-return duties during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|After {{all three}} contestants {{have played a}} Cash Builder round {{followed}} by a chase, the contestants who were not <b>caught</b> by the chaser advance to the Final Chase, with the team bank set to the total that they won in their Cash Builder rounds. If all three contestants fail to win their individual chases, the team selects one contestant to play the Final Chase alone {{for a total of}} $15,000 ($5,000 per contestant). During celebrity episodes, contestants who are <b>caught</b> leave with $5,000 for their respective charities.|$|E

5|$|Approaching Artemisium {{towards the}} end of summer, the Persian navy was <b>caught</b> in a gale off the coast of Magnesia and lost around a third of their 1200 ships. After {{arriving}} at Artemisium, the Persians sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of Euboea in an attempt to trap the Greeks, but these were <b>caught</b> in another storm and shipwrecked. The main action of the battle took place after two days of smaller engagements. The two sides fought all day, with roughly equal losses; however, the smaller Allied fleet could not afford the losses.|$|E
