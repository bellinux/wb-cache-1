5|$|There was a {{subsequent}} French {{effort to reach}} Martinique, launched in February 1809 before news of the British invasion had reached Europe. Three ships {{of the line and}} two disarmed frigates were sent with soldiers and supplies towards the island, but learned of Villaret de Joyeuse's surrender in late March and instead took shelter in the Îles des Saintes, blockaded by Cochrane's squadron. On 14 April, Cochrane seized the Saintes and the French fled, the three ships of the line drawing away Cochrane's forces so that the frigates <b>could</b> <b>slip</b> away and reach Guadeloupe. During the ensuing Action of 14–17 April 1809, the French flagship Hautpoult was chased down and captured, but two escaped and the frigates reached Guadeloupe, although neither would ever return to France.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters <b>could</b> <b>slip</b> so easily into a dream.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method for}} {{piercing}} ears, first made {{popular in the}} 1960s, {{was the use of}} sharpened spring-loaded earrings known as self-piercers, trainers, or sleepers, which gradually pushed through the earlobe. However, these <b>could</b> <b>slip</b> from their initial placement position, often resulting in more discomfort, and many times would not go {{all the way through the}} earlobe without additional pressure being applied. This method has fallen into disuse due to the popularity of faster and more successful piercing techniques.|$|E

25|$|Traction of the ICE1 {{trainsets}} {{is achieved}} by the eight driven axles of both power cars. Because relatively few axles have traction, the steepness of the grade the trains can safely negotiate are limited. The ICE1 is limited to grades of about 3.5%. Steeper grades cannot be negotiated safely, because the wheels <b>could</b> <b>slip</b> due to the low adhesion under adverse conditions, which {{may lead to a}} stopped train becoming stuck on a grade. This {{is one of the reasons}} the ICE1 is not homologated for the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line, which has grades of up to 4%.|$|E
25|$|While the fruitless {{negotiations}} {{were taking place}} the Fallschirmjägers were preparing {{to move away from}} their stronghold and find a new place to fight from. The arrival of the two Norwegian mortars had completely changed the tactical situation and the German force′s supply of ammunition was also running dangerously low. Schmidt decided that he had to move his troops into a new and more defensible position. Negotiations were kept up to buy time so the paratroopers <b>could</b> <b>slip</b> away into cover of darkness. Schmidt believed that strong German forces were advancing up the Gudbrandsdal valley and that if he could hold out for a little while longer the situation might still be salvaged. The reality of the situation was however that the German advanced units were stuck just north of Minnesund far to the south of both Gudbrandsdal and Dombås.|$|E
500|$|After a 10-day voyage, {{she arrived}} in Berehaven, Ireland, on 23 August. Along with [...] and her sister , the three were nicknamed the [...] "Bantry Bay Squadron"; officially, they were BatDiv 6 {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Thomas S. Rodgers, who chose Utah as his flagship. For the rest of the war, the three ships {{operated}} from the bay, escorting the large and valuable convoys bound for the British Isles to ensure no German heavy surface ships <b>could</b> <b>slip</b> past the British Grand Fleet and annihilate the merchant ships and their weak escorts of older cruisers. This never came to pass, and the war ended on 11 November with Nevada not getting a chance to engage an enemy during the war.|$|E

500|$|The British were {{determined}} to neutralise Tirpitz and remove the threat she posed to Allied lines of communication in the Arctic. Following the repeated, ineffectual bombing attacks and the failed Chariot attack in October 1942, the British turned to the newly designed X Craft midget submarines. The planned attack, Operation Source, included attacks on Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, and Lützow. The X Craft were towed by large submarines to their destinations, where they <b>could</b> <b>slip</b> under anti-torpedo nets to each drop two powerful 2 tonne mines on the sea bed under {{the bottom of the}} target. Ten vessels were assigned to the operation, scheduled for 20–25 September 1943. Only eight of the vessels reached Norway for the attack, which began early on 22 September. Three of the vessels, X5, X6, and X7, successfully breached Tirpitzs defences, two of which—X6 and X7—managed to lay their mines. X5 was detected some [...] from the nets and sunk by a combination of gunfire and depth charges.|$|E
500|$|For Bloodstone and Bloodlust, Wayne Toth and Norman Cabrera came {{on board}} to create the special make-up effects for the films; they also pulled double duty {{composing}} and performing the music, alongside Romanian musicians, {{for a portion of}} Bloodstone. The limited budget that Toth and Cabrera had to work forced them to use any location they could find in order to apply the make-up to the actors, as they did not have a separate workstation. Make-up trailers would be created in local resident's homes, cave openings, inside of cars, or just sitting {{on the side of the}} road. To create Radu's face, Toth and Cabrera applied four separate prosthetic pieces to Anders Hove's forehead, left and right cheek, and his chin. A cosmetic make-up is applied over his entire face to help conceal those four prosthetics. This was the same process used in the original Subspecies film, although Toth and Cabrera admit to tweaking the coloring of Radu's skin. One major change to the make-up process was to Radu's hands. In the original film, Hove had to wear individual appliances on each of his fingers, but to cut back on the time needed to apply the make-up, Toth and Cabrera created a pair of prosthetic gloves that Hove <b>could</b> <b>slip</b> on his hands. For [...] "Mummy", Radu's sorceress mother, a headpiece was cast from Pamela Gordon, which included her shoulders as well. After the make-up was applied to give the cast a [...] "dry" [...] and [...] "mummified" [...] appearance, it was slipped over Gordon's head leaving only her face showing. From there, Toth and Cabrera applied a separate face prosthetic. The facial appliance gave Gordon near zero visibility, having only a single eye slit for her left eye. The crew had to escort her around sets so that she would not injure herself. Gordon was given a pair of dentures to wear, as well as some prosthetic gloves similar to what Hove wore. The rest of Gordon's body was draped in clothing to conceal it.|$|E

[...] He referred {{to talk about his}} presidential prospects as silly, and also addressed the risk of being typecast, as another young African-American politician, Harold Ford, had given the keynote address in 2000.

2500|$|In July 1758, after Edward Hawke {{had decided}} to strike his flag and return to port over a {{misunderstanding}} at which he took offence, Anson hoisted his own flag in the first-rate [...] and took over command of the Western Squadron again. Anson oversaw Britain's naval response to a more serious French invasion attempt in 1759. He instituted a close blockade of the French coast, which proved crippling to the French economy and ensured no invasion fleet <b>could</b> <b>slip</b> out undetected. The British victories at the Battle of Lagos in August 1759 and the Battle of Quiberon Bay in November 1759 destroyed any realistic hope of a major invasion of the British Isles.|$|E
2500|$|Generalization {{to regular}} polygons arrived in 1985, during a {{geometry}} seminar run by G. D. Chakerian at UC Davis. Elaine Kasimatis, a graduate student, [...] "was {{looking for some}} algebraic topic she <b>could</b> <b>slip</b> into" [...] the seminar. Sherman Stein suggested dissections of the square and the cube: [...] "a topic that Chakerian grudgingly admitted was geometric." [...] After her talk, Stein asked about regular pentagons. Kasimatis answered with , proving that for n > 5, the spectrum of a regular n-gon is [...] Her proof builds on Monsky's proof, extending the p-adic valuation to the complex numbers for each prime divisor of n and applying some elementary results from the theory of cyclotomic fields. It is also the first proof to explicitly use an affine transformation {{to set up a}} convenient coordinate system. [...] then framed the problem of finding the spectrum of a general polygon, introducing the terms spectrum and principal. They proved that almost all polygons lack equidissections, and that not all polygons are principal.|$|E
2500|$|Program {{managers}} {{identified the}} analysis and repairs that were required to safely launch the shuttle, and this analysis was reviewed at a special Program Requirements Control Board (PRCB) held on 24 November. Managers announced at that meeting that the launch window available in early December would be passed up, with a new target of 17 December set, but cautioned that the launch <b>could</b> <b>slip</b> into February 2011. After reviewing the space station's December traffic model following the realigned Johannes Kepler ATV's launch date, NASA had identified a potential launch window in mid-/late-December 2010. The 17 December 2010 date was preferred {{because it would have}} allowed the shuttle to carry more stored oxygen to the International Space Station to help it deal with oxygen generation issues, which the crew had dealt with for several months. [...] "What we've told the agency leadership is that clearly we're not ready for the 3 December to 7 December window that's coming up next week," [...] John Shannon, NASA's SSP manager, said in a news conference held after the special PCRB. [...] "We'll leave the option open for a launch window for 17 December, but a lot of data has to come together to support that".|$|E

2500|$|On 27 August 2013, the Army and Marine Corps {{announced}} that full-scale testing of JLTV prototypes would begin the following week, {{with all three}} vendors having had 66 vehicles delivered.
