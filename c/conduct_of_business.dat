25|$|Perhaps Wolfe's most {{remarkable}} {{departure from the}} brownstone is due to personal reasons, not to business, and thus does not violate the rule regarding the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> away from the office.

He also wrote, [...] "They are trying to add fuel to the fire that has been extinguished, by saying that Mumbaikars have rotten brains". The {{outburst}} was apparently in response to MPs from Bihar who had disrupted {{the proceedings of the}} Lok Sabha in protest against the attacks on North Indians. Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, upset with the remarks, demanded that the Prime Minister and the Centre intervene in the matter immediately. The Saamna editorial prompted at least 16Lok Sabha MPs from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, belonging to the RJD, JD (U), SP and the Congress, to give notice for breach of privilege proceedings against Bal Thackeray. After the matter was raised in the Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said: [...] "If anybody has made any comment on our members' functioning in the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> in the House, not only do we treat that with the contempt that it deserves, but also any action that may be necessary will be taken according to procedure and well established norms. Nobody will be spared".|$|E

2500|$|Reforms {{were carried}} out in 1993. Although all feminist {{projects}} seeking clear recognition of the two sexes were not carried to term, reforms inclined towards a sharing of authority between the two spouses instead of the exclusive authority of the father. Amendment no. 93-74 of July 12, 1993 modified the Code giving wives the right to transfer her patrimony and nationality to children {{to the same extent}} as husbands, even if she was married to a foreigner, on the sole condition that the father has given his approval. Other measures consecrated the participation of the mother in the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> concerning children and the obligatory consent of the mother for the marriage of her minor child. Furthermore, women acquired the right to represent their children in several judicial procedures, to open and to manage a savings account for their benefit. Furthermore, the text makes it obligatory for spouses to be treated with [...] "kindness" [...] and to participate in the management of the home. Until then women had to accept the husband's prerogative. Finally, another prescription annulled the privilege of paternal grandparents to receive support payments for children. It made maternal grandparents equally entitled, eliminating the concept of the patriarchal family.|$|E
2500|$|Paul IV died on 18 August 1559 after a {{contentious}} reign of four years, {{two months and}} twenty-seven days. The Conclave to elect his successor held its opening ceremonies on 5 September 1559 with forty-four cardinals in attendance. On 6 September, Cardinal du Bellay, who was Dean of the College of Cardinals, celebrated the Mass of the Holy Spirit, and then the Conclave settled down to a leisurely <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> [...] They finished the Electoral Capitulations on 8 September, and the bulls referring to conclave rules were read on 9 September. Du Bellay, however, was ill, and {{did not attend the}} reading. [...] In the First Scrutiny, held later that day, he had to cast his vote from his sickbed. [...] Beginning on 26 September various ambassadors, led by the Spanish Ambassador, appeared {{at the entrance to the}} Conclave area and harangued the cardinals inside about the necessity of getting a pope elected. [...] Security was so bad that on 2 October, the cardinals appointed a reform committee, with Du Bellay its leader, to restore order. [...] It was ineffective. [...] On 9 October the known agents of the Powers and a considerable number of Conclavists were expelled. [...] On 1 November there were forty-seven cardinals at the Conclave, five confined to bed. [...] On the afternoon of Christmas Day, after a good deal of politicking, the cardinals finally settled on Cardinal Giovanni Angelo de' Medici, who was elected by acclamation. He was asked if he would consent to a Scrutiny the next morning, and he agreed, providing that it was recognised that he had been validly and canonically elected on the 25th. [...] He chose the throne name Pius IV. Cardinal du Bellay was absent.|$|E

All the shops were shut in the place, and scarcely a soul abroad in the street, and when he banged at a door a window was apt to open. He seemed to consider that the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> from open windows was an entirely legitimate and obvious method. Finally he and Bensington got the Red Lion dog-cart and set off with the waggonette, to overtake the baggage. They did this a little beyond the cross-roads, and so reached Hickleybrow first.|$|E
60|$|And {{this book}} is the sequel. So utterly at {{variance}} is destiny with all the little plans of men. I may perhaps mention here that very recently I had come an ugly cropper in certain business enterprises. Sitting now surrounded by all the circumstances of wealth, there is a luxury in admitting my extremity. I can admit, even, that {{to a certain extent}} my disasters were conceivably of my own making. It may be there are directions in which I have some capacity, but the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> operations is not among these. But in those days I was young, and my youth among other objectionable forms took that of a pride in my capacity for affairs. I am young still in years, but the things that have happened to me have rubbed something of the youth from my mind. Whether they have brought any wisdom to light below it is a more doubtful matter.|$|E
6000|$|And {{there is}} much in the common {{experience}} {{of life and the}} common <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> that seems to support this view. It is undoubtedly true if we look at any little portion of business activity taken as a fragment by itself. On the most purely selfish grounds I may find that it [...] "pays" [...] to hire an expert at a hundred dollars a day, and might find that it spelled ruin to attempt to raise the wages of my workingmen beyond four dollars a day. Everybody knows that in any particular business at any particular place and time with prices at any particular point, there is a wage that can be paid and a wage that can not. And everybody, or nearly everybody, bases on these obvious facts a series of entirely erroneous conclusions. Because we cannot change the part we are apt to think we cannot change the whole. Because one brick in the wall is immovable, we forget that the wall itself might be rebuilt.|$|E

6000|$|If I {{have made}} myself intelligible {{up to this}} point, the {{question}} [...] that arises is, can we make out such a course of policy for the [...] session, either in the general <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>business,</b> or in some [...] departments and by certain measures, as will with reasonable [...] likelihood reanimate some portion of that sentiment in our favour, [...] which carried us in a manner so remarkable through the election of [...] 1868? I discuss the matter now in its aspect towards party: it is [...] not necessary to make an argument to show that our option can only [...] be among things {{all of which are}} sound in principle. First, then, [...] I do not believe that we can find this recovery of vital force in [...] our general administration of public business. As men, [...] notwithstanding the advantage drawn from Bright’s return, the [...] nation appears to think that it has had enough of us, that our [...] lease is out. It is a question of measures then: can we by any [...] measures materially mend the position of the party for an [...] impending election?...|$|E
60|$|Lord George Bentinck {{was very}} anxious {{that there should}} be a {{parliamentary}} summary of this enormous and eventful session of '48, that the <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> by the ministry should be traced and criticized and the character of the House of Commons vindicated, and he appealed to the writer of these observations to undertake the task. But the writer was unwilling to accede to this suggestion, not only because at the end of August he shrank from a laborious effort, but principally because he did not hold that his position in the House of Commons warranted on his part such an interference, since, after all, he was only the comrade in arms of one who chose to be only an independent member of the House. He therefore unaffectedly stated that he thought the office was somewhat above his measure. But Lord George Bentinck would not listen to these representations. 'I don't pretend to know much,' he said, 'but I can judge of men and horses.' It is difficult to refuse those who are themselves setting a constant example of self-sacrifice, and therefore, so far as the labour was concerned, the writer would not have shrunk from the exertion even on the last day of the month of August, and when the particular wish of Lord George was found to be more general than the writer presumed to suppose, he accordingly endeavoured to accomplish the intention.|$|E
60|$|The {{principles}} {{which are}} involved and recognized in this constitutional doctrine, if followed {{as far as}} they will go, are a guide to the limitation and definition of the general functions of representative assemblies. In the first place, it is admitted in all countries in which the representative system is practically understood, that numerous representative bodies ought not to administer. The maxim is grounded not only on the most essential principles of good government, but on those of the successful <b>conduct</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> of any description. No body of men, unless organized and under command, is fit for action, in the proper sense. Even a select board, composed of few members, and these specially conversant with the business to be done, is always an inferior instrument to some one individual who could be found among them, and would be improved in character if that one person were made the chief, and all the others reduced to subordinates. What can be done better by a body than by any individual is deliberation. When it is necessary or important to secure hearing and consideration to many conflicting opinions, a deliberative body is indispensable. Those bodies, therefore, are frequently useful, even for administrative business, but in general only as advisers; such business being, as a rule, better conducted under the responsibility of one. Even a joint-stock company has always in practice, if not in theory, a managing director; its good or bad management depends essentially on some one person's qualifications, and the remaining directors, when of any use, are so by their suggestions to him, or by the power they possess of watching him, and restraining or removing him in case of misconduct. That they are ostensibly equal shares with him in the management is no advantage, but a considerable set-off against any good which they are capable of doing: it weakens greatly the sense in his own mind, and in those of other people, of that individual responsibility in which he should stand forth personally and undividedly.|$|E
