The Silver Camel Mine has <b>cerargyrite</b> {{also known as}} chlorargyrite or horn silver.

50|$|The Iron King, Empire, and Brush Heap {{were some}} of the first mines in the area. Most {{production}} was within 460 feet of the surface in the supergene zone. Ore minerals included <b>cerargyrite,</b> native silver, polybasite, and argentiferous galena. From 1952 to 1959, 5,689 tons of manganese ore were produced from the Fusselman Dolomite, mainly from the Iron King Mine. Pyrolusite is the main manganese ore mineral.|$|E
50|$|At the Presidio Mine, {{which started}} {{operation}} in 1880, the Permian Cibolo limestone formation is overlain unconformably by the Presidio formation, a massive dark-grey Cretaceous limestone. The Shafter limestone rests unconformably on the Presidio formation. Ore deposits {{are found in}} the Permian limestone and consist of supergene replacement minerals argentite and <b>cerargyrite</b> along the bedding. Veins and replacement mineralization are present in the overlying Cretaceous beds. Lodes in the Permian limetone include Manto ore deposits and thrust fault deposits, while those in the Cretaceous rocks are steep veins along normal faults. Smaller mines have operated in the district at various times, but the Presidio remains the largest and most continuous.|$|E
50|$|Chlorargyrite is {{the mineral}} form of silver {{chloride}} (AgCl). Chlorargyrite occurs as a secondary mineral {{phase in the}} oxidation of silver mineral deposits. It crystallizes in the isometric - hexoctahedral crystal class. Typically massive to columnar in occurrence it also has been found as colorless to variably yellow cubic crystals. The color changes to brown or purple on exposure to light. It is quite soft with a Mohs hardness of 1 to 2 and dense with a specific gravity of 5.55. It {{is also known as}} <b>cerargyrite</b> and, when weathered by desert air, as horn silver. Bromian chlorargyrite (or embolite) is also common. Chlorargyrite is water-insoluble.|$|E

40|$|Thesis, (M. S.) Geological Sciences. Plate 1 : Index Map, page 1 Plate 2 : Index Map, page 2 The Calico Mining District {{is located}} in the Calico Mountains, California. The {{sequence}} of exposed rocks in the District filled the Calico Basin during the Miocene. An excess of two-thousand Feet of the andesitic Pickhandle Formation is uncomformably overlain by 2, 500 feet of rhyolitic to Andesitic epiclastic rocks of the Calico Formation. A few thousand feet of variable colored lacustrine deposits of the Barstow Formation conformably over the the Calico Formation, Andcsitic to basaltic flows and flow breccias of the Dry Lake Volcanics unconformably overlie the Barstow Formation. Formation of northwest-trending antithetic faults, at intervals of five-hundred to one-thousand feet, accompanied a general doming of the Calico Mountains. Intense folding of the Barstow Formation Resulted from the lake beds sliding off the doming surface. Ores of silver chloride and other halogens of silver from the zone of oxidation produced 35 million ounces of silver from 1898 to 1894. Silver deposits in the District are of two types: 1) vein-fault systems consisting of <b>cerargyrite</b> in a barite hematite-red jasper gangue or as cerargyrite-hematitie cement in fault breccias, or 2) as deposits of irregular form often associated with a fault and bedded tuffs. Recent investigations indicate the ore bodies are stratabound primarily restricted to the Calico formation. Since the early 1890 s, the ore has been considered hydrothermal in origin. A syngeneic origin is now propose...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{sulphide}} minerals in {{the process}} of Ag reprecipitation during the supergene alteration of polymetallic ores has been evaluated using the databases WATEQ 4 F (Ball and Nordstron, 1991) and SUPCRT' 92 (Johnson et al., 1992). Four common principle oxidation stage were fixed previously with formation of the following Ag-products, when oxygen fugacity decreases: (1) <b>cerargyrite</b> AgCl(s) below the residual ore zone at lgf % atm 10 97 Stool/l; (2) Ag(s) in {{the upper part of the}} zone of oxidation. Corresponding to the differences in Eh-pH regimes, the Ag § activity can vary within the limits: lg jo_~,atm pH lgaAg,,mol/ 1 30 [...] 40 3 [...] 3. 23 [...] 5. 73 [...] 40 [...] 50 4 [...] 6. 73 [...] 9. 23; (3) Ag 2 S in the zone of secondary ore enrichment at lgfo 2,atm>- 60. 6, when pH = 3, asol = 10 - 3 mol/ 1; (4) Ag(s ~ in reducing environment as the ground-water percolates to greater depth. Ag(s) reprecipitation i the upper part of the zone of oxidation eeds relatively high Ag + activity in acid solutions and can proceed only at near-neutral pH or atf%,atm much lower than 10 - 40. But the interaction of silver ion with residual pyrite, galena and sphalerite takes place. The cation-exchange reactions have negative Gibbs free energy, and thus could proceed spontaneously under ambient conditions: MeS + 2 Ag + = Ag 2 S + Me 2 + (1) here Me are Pb (AGreact ion =- 31. 74 kcal/mol) and Zn (- 33. 33 kcal/mol). Recent spectroscopic investigation of sulphide minerals surface after their interaction with Ag +-containing solutions confirmed the formation of Ag 2 S as the first product (Scaini et al., 1995). It is in accordance with last Sato's diagrams (Sato, 1992). If the Me 2 + activities are 10 - 6 mol/ 1, the needed Ag + to precipitate on the surface of PbS are 10 - 146 mol/ 1 and ZnS- 10 - 152 mol/ 1. The use of field chemical analyses can correct these values because the excess of metals shifts the equilibrium left. The behaviour of pyrite is more flexible and depends on numerous variables...|$|E
40|$|The Quebrada Marquesa Quadrangle in Chile {{exhibits}} {{a series of}} mineralizations comprising manto-type manganese and copper deposits of Lower Creta-ceous age, and copper and silver veins of Tertiary age. The deposits are hosted by volcanic and volcaniclastic units of the Arqueros (Hauterivian-Barremian) and Quebrada Marquesa (Barremian-Albian) Formations. Three episodes of manganese mineralization (Mn 1 - 3) are recognized within the study area. Hydrothermal activity leading to episodes 1 and 3 was of minor importance, while the second one (Mn 2) gave rise to major manto-type deposits of both manganese and copper in the Talcuna mining district. Extensional faulting during Tertiary time resulted in block faulting and the unroofing of the oldest andesitic volcanics and marine sediments (Arqueros Formation). This episode was accompanied by magmatic and hydrothermal activity leading to vein formation in the Arqueros (Ag) and Talcuna (Cu) districts. The latter veins cross-cut the previous manto-type copper deposits. Ore mineralogy is similar in both styles of mineralization (manto- and vein-type) and consists mainly of chalcopyrite and bor-nite, with variable amounts of galena, tetrahedrite (vein-related), chalcocite, sphalerite, pyrite, hematite, digenite and covellite. Alteration processes at Talcuna {{can be divided into}} two categories, those related to the Lower Cretaceous manto-type episode (LK alteration: chlorite-epidote-calcite-albite, prehnite, zeolite), and those associated with the locally mineralized normal faults of Tertiary age (Tt alteration: chlorite-calcite, sericite). The Arqueros silver veins display an ore mineralogy consisting of arquerite, argentite, native silver, polybasite, <b>cerargyrite</b> and pyrargyrite-proustite; associated altera-tion includes strong chloritization of the country rock. The manto-type deposits formed from fluids of salinity between 11 and 19 wt. % NaCl equivalent and temperatures between 120 and 205 °C. Mineralizing fluids during the vein-type stage circulated at lower temperatures, between 70 and 170 °C, with salinity values in a wide range from 3 to 27 wt. % NaCl equivalent. This distribution of salinities is interpreted {{as the result of the}} complex interplay of two diferent processes: boiling and fluid mixing; the former is considered to control the major mineralogical, textural and fluid inclusion features of the vein-type deposits. We suggest that the Lower Cretaceous mineralization (manto-type stage) developed in response to widespread hydrothermal activity (geothermal field-type) involving basinal brines...|$|E
