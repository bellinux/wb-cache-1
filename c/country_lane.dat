5|$|In El Dorado, Sinaloa, {{near where}} the storm made landfall, the {{hurricane}} washed out away roads and destroyed many flimsy homes. Strong winds knocked down electricity towers, trees, and traffic signs, leaving many without power. In Mazatlán, to the southeast of where Lane moved ashore, the hurricane produced strong winds and heavy rains, causing street flooding and power outages. The threat of the hurricane forced the cancellation of an Independence Day Parade. Between Mazatlán and the state capital, Culiacán, the hurricane destroyed a bridge, leaving dozens of trucks stranded. In Culiacán, one person died when he drove his car into a river, while several streets were flooded from the storm. Throughout Sinaloa, several damaged roads left many communities {{cut off from the}} rest of the <b>country.</b> <b>Lane</b> caused severe agricultural damage in the state, possibly reaching as high as $600million (2006MXN, $55million 2006USD). The hurricane also damaged water treatment facilities and distribution systems in multiple communities, prompting the Secretariat of Health to declare a sanitary alert in Sinaloa. Damage in Sinaloa totaled to around $1.2billion (2006MXN), $109.3million (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} a simple <b>country</b> <b>lane</b> on {{the boundary of}} Hyde Park, separated by a brick wall. Aristocratic properties appeared during the late 18th century, including Breadalbene House, Somerset House and Londonderry House. The road grew in popularity during the 19th century after improvements to Hyde Park Corner and more affordable views of the park, which attracted the nouveau riche to the street and led to it {{becoming one of the}} most fashionable roads to live on in London. Notable residents included the 1st Duke of Westminster's residence at Grosvenor House, the Dukes of Somerset at Somerset House and the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli at No.93. Other historic properties include Dorchester House, Brook House and Dudley House. In the 20th century, Park Lane became well known for its luxury hotels, particularly The Dorchester, completed in 1931, which became closely associated with eminent writers and international film stars. Flats and shops began appearing on the road, including penthouse flats. Several buildings suffered damage during World War II, yet the road still attracted significant development, including the Park Lane Hotel and the London Hilton on Park Lane, and several sports car garages. A number of properties on the road today are owned by some of the wealthiest businessmen from the Middle East and Asia. Current residents include business mogul Mohamed Al-Fayed and former council leader and Lord Mayor Dame Shirley Porter.|$|E
25|$|The Middle Road was {{initially}} constructed as a depression relief project, employing 74 men to grade and widen the <b>country</b> <b>lane</b> into a four lane roadway. In 1934, {{the concept was}} reworked by Thomas McQuesten and Robert Mellville Smith into a divided, limited access freeway, the first such intercity stretch in North America when it was opened in 1939.|$|E

25|$|Collins {{was beaten}} and {{stabbed to death}} in his 45th year by an {{unidentified}} assailant(s) {{early in the morning}} of 27 January 1999, whilst walking his dogs near the Barcroft Park Estate in Newry along a quiet stretch of <b>country</b> <b>lane</b> at Doran's Hill, just within sight of Sliabh gCuircin (Camlough Mountain). His body also bore marks of having been struck by a car moving at speed. The subsequent police investigation and Coroner's Inquest commented upon the extremity of weaponed violence to Collins' head and face used during the attack.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the route}} was paved with concrete. The two roadways were {{separated}} by a median varying in width, often filled with trees. Most of the rows of trees along the old <b>country</b> <b>lane</b> were incorporated into the median, and new ones were planted in the gaps, as equal focus was given to functionality as aesthetics. Over most of the bridges, the two roadways converged, undivided. These were, however, a great improvement from the bridges along the old lane, {{as seen in the}} picture at left. At Highway 10 (Hurontario Street) was Canada's first cloverleaf interchange, opened in 1937.|$|E

25|$|Sutcliffe {{attacked}} Olive Smelt in Halifax in August. Employing {{the same}} modus operandi, he struck {{her from behind}} and used a knife to slash her, this time above her buttocks. Again he was interrupted, and left his victim badly injured but alive. Like Rogulskyj, Smelt suffered emotional scars, including clinical depression. On 27 August, Sutcliffe attacked 14-year-old Tracy Browne in Silsden. He struck her from behind and hit her on the head five times while she was walking along a <b>country</b> <b>lane.</b> He ran off {{when he saw the}} lights of a passing car, leaving his victim requiring brain surgery. Sutcliffe was not convicted of the attack, but confessed to it in 1992.|$|E
25|$|On 14 November 2001 at Lewes Crown Court, {{the jury}} heard from several {{witnesses}}. The key witnesses included Payne's oldest brother {{who had seen}} a 'scruffy-looking man with yellowish teeth' drive by. However, Lee Payne did not pick out Roy Whiting when he was selected for an identity parade. One of Payne's shoes was found {{by a member of}} the public in a <b>country</b> <b>lane</b> and forensic tests had found fibres from Whiting's van on the shoe. This was the only item of Payne's clothing to be recovered. A strand of blonde hair on a T-shirt was found in Whiting's van. A DNA test established there was a one-in-a-billion chance of it belonging to anyone other than Payne.|$|E
25|$|Sandwiched between roads, factories, railway {{lines and}} the aerodrome, Filton {{expanded}} little after WWII. However, from the late 1970s a trading estate slowly developed {{on the eastern side}} of the Bristol/South Wales railway line in what is now known as East Filton. Later, the Ministry of Defence set up a large office complex, known as Abbey Wood, in the same area. During the mid-1970s the A38 trunk road was upgraded to a dual carriageway. Station Road, a <b>country</b> <b>lane</b> in the early part of the 20th century, was also widened to become a dual carriageway and form part of the Avon Ring Road. In 1973 the Rolls-Royce car division was separated as Rolls-Royce Motors. Rolls-Royce (1971) Limited (the engine division) was privatised in 1987 as Rolls-Royce plc.|$|E

25|$|Portobello Road is a {{construction}} of the Victorian era. Before about 1850, it {{was little more than}} a <b>country</b> <b>lane</b> connecting Portobello Farm with Kensal Green in the north and what is today Notting Hill in the south. Much of it consisted of hayfields, orchards and other open land. The road ultimately took form piecemeal in the second half of the 19th century, nestling between the large new residential developments of Paddington and Notting Hill. Its shops and markets thrived on serving the wealthy inhabitants of the elegant crescents and terraces that sprang up around it, and its working class residents found employment in the immediate vicinity as construction workers, domestic servants, coachmen, messengers, tradesmen and costermongers. After the Hammersmith and City Railway line was completed in 1864, and Ladbroke Grove station opened, the northern end of Portobello Road was also developed, and the last of the open fields disappeared under brick and concrete.|$|E

The parish church {{is at the end of}} a gravelled track, off a <b>country</b> <b>lane</b> between the lower part of Talwrn and the hamlet of Ceint to the south. It can also be accessed by public footpath from Plas Penmynydd, once home to Owen Tudor, grandfather of King Henry VII and founder of the Tudor dynasty. The parish takes its name from the church: the Welsh word [...] originally meant [...] "enclosure" [...] and then [...] "church", with [...] "-ffinan" [...] denoting the saint.|$|E
500|$|Moggach {{believed}} the novel was very filmable, [...] "despite it containing no description {{and being a}} very unvisual book". To Wright, many other period films had relied on paintings for inspiration rather than photographs, causing them to appear unreal. He thus used [...] "Austen's prose [...] many visual references {{for the people in}} the story", including using close-up shots of various characters. The filmmakers also changed several scenes to more romantic locales than those in the book. For instance, in the film, Darcy first proposes outdoors in a rainstorm at a building with neoclassical architecture; in the book, this scene takes place inside a parsonage. In the film, his second proposal occurs on the misty moors as dawn breaks; in the book, he and Elizabeth are walking down a <b>country</b> <b>lane</b> in broad daylight. Wright has acknowledged that [...] "there are a lot of period film clichés; some of them are in the film and some are not, but for me it was important to question them".|$|E

500|$|Wilde did {{not meet}} Walter Pater until his third year, but had been enthralled by his Studies in the History of the Renaissance, {{published}} during Wilde's final year in Trinity. Pater argued that man's sensibility to beauty should be refined above all else, and that each moment should be felt to its fullest extent. Years later, in De Profundis, Wilde called Pater's Studies... "that book that has had such a strange influence over my life". He learned tracts of the book by heart, and carried it with him on travels in later years. Pater gave Wilde his sense of almost flippant devotion to art, though it was John Ruskin who gave him a purpose for it. Ruskin despaired at the self-validating aestheticism of Pater, arguing {{that the importance of}} art lies in its potential for the betterment of society. Ruskin admired beauty, but believed it must be allied with, and applied to, moral good. When Wilde eagerly attended Ruskin's lecture series The Aesthetic and Mathematic Schools of Art in Florence, he learned about aesthetics as simply the non-mathematical elements of painting. Despite being given to neither early rising nor manual labour, Wilde volunteered for Ruskin's project to convert a swampy <b>country</b> <b>lane</b> into a smart road neatly edged with flowers.|$|E

2500|$|Heathrow Airport {{originated}} in 1929 {{as a small}} airfield (Great West Aerodrome) on land south-east of the hamlet of Heathrow from which the airport takes its name.

2500|$|Before {{this area}} of Birmingham was {{developed}} in the 18th century, Colmore Row was a <b>country</b> <b>lane</b> called New Hall Lane, connecting the roads from City centre to Dudley and West Bromwich and separating the farmlands of the New Hall Estate to the north from those of the Inge Estate to the south. Development of the south of the lane started with the building of St Philip's Church (now St Philip's Cathedral) in 1708. In 1746, a private Act of Parliament opened up the New Hall Estate to the north for development, with the first plots being let and developed from 1747 onwards.|$|E
