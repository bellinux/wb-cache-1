50|$|Many {{makers of}} ringsaws offer a similar blade as a bandsaw too. The ringsaw blade in {{comparison}} {{may be made}} rigid, thus stronger and less flexible under <b>cutting</b> <b>loads,</b> giving a more accurate cut. Some make a particular feature of the ring saw's ability to cut forwards, backwards and sideways. As the bandsaw blade must be flexible enough to pass around the wheels, its blades are limited to cutting on the forward edge. The oblong bandsaw has a blade that is supported on two large wheels. The interval between the two wheels is supported by blade guides immediately behind the cutting zone. Ring saws {{do not have the}} same straight run of blade, nor the opportunity to support much of the blade as with the wheels of a bandsaw. A ring saw is thus a somewhat fragile machine and excess pressure on a thin blade is likely to damage it.|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of coated tool wear mechanisms in milling {{is crucial for}} explaining film failure and adjusting appropriately the cutting conditions. In the described research, coated cemented carbide inserts were applied in up- and down-milling stainless steel for monitoring the tool wear at repetitive <b>cutting</b> <b>loads</b> of various magnitudes and durations. The variable stress, strain and strain-rate fields developed in the tool during milling affect the film-substrate deformations, and thus the resulting <b>cutting</b> <b>loads</b> and the coating fatigue failure. For investigating the influence of cyclic impact load magnitude and duration on the film fatigue of coated specimens, an impact tester was employed which facilitates the modulation of the force signal. Using this device, repetitive impact loads with different duration and time profiles were applied on coated cutting inserts. These loads approximately simulate the developed ones in milling when the cutting edge penetrates the workp iece material. The attained coated tool life {{was associated with the}} developed maximum strain and its rate in the film during milling. The latter factors were correlated to the strain and strain rate dependent on coating fatigue endurance.

During the cutting process, the speed, the volume and the <b>cutting</b> <b>load</b> are optimized <b>cutting</b> parameters when the performance characteristics, which include Weibull modulus and blade wear, are taken into consideration. In this paper, optimization with multiple performance characteristics is found to be the highest cutting speed and the smallest cutting volume, and the medium <b>cutting</b> <b>load.</b> An analysis of the variance of the blade wear indicates that the cutting speed (47. 21 %), the cutting volume (14. 62 %) and the <b>cutting</b> <b>load</b> (12. 20 %) are the most significant parameters in the cutting process of glass fibers.

40|$|AbstractLinear {{motor drives}} (LMDs) {{are well known}} to provide {{significant}} advantages in terms of positioning speed and accuracy over traditional screw drives (SDs), making them better suited for high-speed high-precision machine tools. However, their use in such machine tools is severely limited by their tendency to consume a lot of electrical energy and cause thermal issues, particularly under high <b>cutting</b> <b>loads.</b> A hybrid feed drive (HFD) has recently been proposed as a possible solution to this dilemma. The HFD switches between LMD and SD actuation depending on the mode of the manufacturing operation, thus achieving speeds and accuracies similar to LMDs while consuming much less energy. This paper presents a comparative life cycle analysis (LCA) of the proposed HFD with an LMD as the baseline for the comparison. The functional unit is taken as the production of parts that involve heavy cutting by a small-sized 3 -axis precision milling machine for 250 8 -hour work days per year over a 12 -year first-use life span. Energy savings provided by the HFD during its use phase vis-a-vis the additional energy investments into the HFD at various phases in its life cycle are compared. The analysis predicts a net positive impact, in terms of energy and the environment, for the HFD compared to the LMD under high <b>cutting</b> <b>loads...</b>|$|E

40|$|One {{major problem}} {{encountered}} in NC machining is that <b>cutting</b> <b>load</b> fluctuates in twisty tool paths and increases momentarily when milling concave corners where stock material concentrates. Much {{research has been}} conducted on controlling milling forces but the problem remains unsolved. This paper presents a solution to reduce and stabilise <b>cutting</b> <b>load</b> in NC milling operation by applying computational techniques to isolate the concave corners of a machining region, thereby forming a major region and a number of disjoint sub-regions. Due to the suppression of concave corners, the boundary profile of the major region will become smoother. Contour-parallel offset tool paths can then be used to remove the material in the major region. For the isolated sub-regions, special corner removing tool paths with the use of different cutter sizes will be employed. By using this approach, the adverse effects caused by excessive undulation of milling tool path can be reduced. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
