50|$|In ancient Rome, the lex Fufia (also 'Furia, Fusia') Caninia (2 BC) {{was one of}} {{the laws}} that {{national}} assemblies had to pass, after they were requested to do so by Augustus. This law, along with the lex Aelia Sentia, placed limitations on manumissions. In numerical terms this meant that a master who had three slaves <b>could</b> free <b>only</b> two; one who had between four and ten <b>could</b> free <b>only</b> half of them; one with eleven to thirty <b>could</b> free <b>only</b> a third, and so on.

The latter was critical, as previously Epiphany <b>could</b> <b>only</b> use Firefox or Mozilla/SeaMonkey as a layout engine provider, so it <b>could</b> <b>only</b> be installed alongside one of those browsers. The XULRunner support made it possible to install Epiphany as the sole web browser on the system.|$|E

5|$|For {{almost all}} of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of {{audience}} in the Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} precedence in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they <b>could</b> <b>only</b> be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants <b>could</b> <b>only</b> be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E

Shepard won one of the five Democratic slots and was easily elected. On the council, he served as head of the public works committee. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Shepard initially opposed the change, but later voted in favor after party leaders promised him more black Democrats would get political appointments. The amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval but failed in a vote that April.|$|E
