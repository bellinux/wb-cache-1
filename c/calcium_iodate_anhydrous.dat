40|$|The use of <b>calcium</b> <b>iodate</b> <b>anhydrous</b> and {{potassium}} iodide {{as sources of}} iodine is considered safe for all animal species/categories when used up to the currently authorised maximum content of total iodine in complete feed, {{with the exception of}} horses, cats and dogs, for which maximum tolerated levels are 3, 6 and 4 mg I/kg complete feed, respectively. Exposure of consumers was calculated in two scenarios applying the currently authorised maximum iodine contents in feed and reduced contents. The iodine content of food of animal origin, if produced taking account of the currently authorised maximum content of iodine in feed, would represent a substantial risk to high consumers. The risk would originate primarily from the consumption of milk and to a minor extent from consumption of eggs. The UL for adults (600 µg/day) would be exceeded by a factor of 2, and that for toddlers (200 µg/day) by a factor of 4. If the authorised maximum iodine in feed for dairy cows and laying hens were reduced to 2 and 3 mg I/kg feed, respectively, the exposure of adult consumers would be below the UL. However, iodine intake in high-consuming toddlers would remain above the UL (1. 6 -fold). In the absence of data, the additives are considered as irritant to the eyes, skin and respiratory tract, and as dermal sensitisers. Exposure by inhalation should be avoided. The use of the additives in animal nutrition is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. Calcium iodate {{and potassium}} iodide are efficacious sources of iodine to meet animal requirements. The FEEDAP Panel recommends that the maximum iodine contents in complete feed be reduced as follows: dairy cows and minor dairy ruminants, 2 mg I/kg; laying hens, 3 mg I/kg; horses, 3 mg I/kg; cats, 6 mg I/kg and dogs, 4 mg I/kg...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the influence of high iodine intake in ewes on haematological and biochemical parameters of the blood of ewes and their lambs. Twelve pregnant ewes of the Sumava sheep breed and their newborn lambs were included in the experiment. Control group (A) consisted of 6 ewes with 7 lambs and experimental group (B) comprised 6 ewes with 6 lambs. The feed ration was enriched with <b>calcium</b> <b>iodate</b> by addition of 3 and 5 mg/kg in group A and group B, respectively. The studied parameters in ewes and lambs were haematocrit value, red blood cell count and haemoglobin concentration in blood, concentration of urea and total proteins, and alkaline phosphatase activity in blood plasma. No differences were found out in haematocrit value, red blood cell count, concentration of haemoglobin and total proteins between groups of ewes A and B with their lambs. Urea concentration and alkaline phosphatase activity were higher in ewes of group B and their lambs during the entire experimental period. An increase in the values of urea and alkaline phosphatase in the group of ewes and lambs with higher iodine intake indicates a potential risk of high iodine intake associated with changes in the thyroid activity in ewes and their lambs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{seasonal}} differences in mineral contents of plants often consumed by wild red deer located in a fenced game estate, south-eastern Spain. Forage plants were sampled throughout 1 year and analysed for macro and trace mineral concentrations. We also offered a cafeteria set of supplemented minerals to assess whether: (i) intake reflected seasonal reductions in plant content of specific minerals; or (ii) intake of mineral supplements responded to increased deer demand of minerals as a result of greater seasonal needs likely arising from lactation, antler growth or skeletal growth. Although no significant seasonal trend was found in mineral distributions of plants, our study suggested that concentrations of K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Cu and Zn were usually low in plants available to, and consumed by, deer in the study area. In addition, Cu concentration was marginally deficient when compared with the published requirements for other subspecies of red deer. The cafeteria study showed that free-ranging deer had a strong preference for sodium compounds and zinc sulfate, a much weaker attraction to <b>calcium</b> <b>iodate,</b> and no intake in calcium phosphates, Mg and Fe. Consumption of supplemented minerals by deer was maximum in spring and summer and moderate during autumn and winter. Rather than increasing intake of minerals in response to their content in plants, deer may be responding to increased metabolic requirements during antler growth, late gestation and early lactation. Supplementation of mineral compounds is recommended, particularly in the spring-summer period, when the physiological activity is high.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} {{long-term}} effect of excessive iodine intake on thyroid activity and selected immunological, haematological and biochemical parameters in blood of ewes and their lambs. The experiment was conducted from August 2009 to February 2010 in an experimental barn of Faculty of Agriculture, University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice. Into the experiment were used Šumava sheep breed ewes and their born lambs. Group A (control) consisted of 6 ewes after lambing was extended to 7 born lambs, group B (experimental) 6 of 6 ewes and lambs. Lambs were put into the experiment from the 1 st to the 60 th day after birth and received iodine in the milk of their mothers. Iodine supplementation to the diet of ewes was launched during the first to second months of pregnancy and finished 60 days after birth. During the experiment, a group of ewes A received 3, 1 and group B 5, 1 mg iodine per kg of dietary dry matter in the form of <b>calcium</b> <b>iodate.</b> During the experiment was regularly collected blood of ewes (before lambing and 1 st, 10 th, 30 th and 60 th day after birth) and lambs (1 st, 3 rd, 10 th, 30 th and 60 th day after birth) to determine the concentration of thyroid stimulating hormone and immunoglobulin G (ELISA) in blood serum, thyroid hormones (RIA), total protein, urea and alkaline phosphatase activity in the blood plasma (biochemical analyser), the content of haemoglobin, white blood cell´s and red blood cell´s counts and haematocrit values in blood (haematological analyser), percentage of albumin, - 1 -globulins, - 2 -globulins, -globulins, and -globulins in blood serum (electrophoresis) and the content of iodine in the blood plasma, urine and milk of ewes (colorimetric method Sandell-Kolthoff). During the experiment were not observed in ewes and lambs clinical symptoms associated with an excessive intake of iodine. In experimental group of ewes with iodine intake 5, 1 mg/kg of dietary dry matter were found higher values of thyroid stimulating hormone, lower values of free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, IgG, white blood cells, - 1 -globulins, - 2 -globulin and -globulin, significantly lower values of -globulins after parturition, significantly higher values of urea and alkaline phosphatase activity. The iodine content in blood plasma, milk and urine of ewes is increased in direct proportion to its concentration in diet. Lambs of mothers with iodine intake of 5, 1 mg/kg of dietary dry matter were significantly higher values of thyroid stimulating hormone from the 10 th day after birth, significantly lower values of free triiodothyronine and free thyroxine first day after birth, immunoglobulin G and -globulins in 30 th day after birth, lower (statistically significant in middle samples) values of total protein and white blood cells, higher values of urea and alkaline phosphatase activity. The weight gains of lambs were not significantly affected by iodine supplementation. These results in ewes with iodine intake of 5, 1 mg/kg dietary dry matter and especially their lambs drawn to risk of reduce the activity of the thyroid gland and the negative impact of parameters of humoral immunity, mainly IgG and -globulins...|$|R
40|$|Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and {{explosives}} (CBRNE) terrorist threats put {{law enforcement and}} soldiers at risk {{both at home and}} abroad. Law enforcement and soldiers must be provided with tools and knowledge to stay ahead of the capabilities of terrorists. Hexamethylene Triperoxide Diamine (HMTD) is a homemade explosive easily synthesized from hexamine, citric acid, and hydrogen peroxide. Although HMTD is very sensitive and prone to stability problems, it has a history of terrorists use, such as in the London bombing of 2005. Because law enforcement personnel must handle this material with no guarantee of purity nor indication of additives, for the sake of safety, knowledge of the stability and reactivity of HMTD was expanded in order to make handling safer. Differential scanning calorimetry was utilized to screen the compatibility of HMTD with various additives. It was found that water and weak acids, such as citric acid, destabilize HMTD. Gas chromatography / mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was employed to characterize both headspace gases (e. g. trimethylamine and dimethylformamide) and condensed phase decomposition products. Monitoring the decomposition of HMTD at room temperature and with gentle heating (60 °C) under various levels of humidity proved that humidity {{plays a major role in}} the kinetics of HMTD decomposition. Liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry was helpful for identification of condensed phase decomposition products and monitoring isotopic labeling studies. Through a labeling study with equimolar 15 N and 14 N hexamine during the synthesis of HMTD, it was found that hexamine dissociates before the formation of HMTD. ^ There is currently a need for specialized pyrotechnic materials to combat the threat of biological weapons. Materials have been characterized and will be chosen based on their potential to produce heat and iodine to kill spore-forming bacteria (e. g. anthrax). One formulation, already proven to kill anthrax simulants, is diiodine pentoxide with aluminum; however, it suffers from poor stability and storage problems. The heat and iodine output from this mixture and candidate replacement mixtures were measured with bomb calorimetry and extraction and analysis of iodine by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Of the mixtures analyzed, <b>calcium</b> <b>iodate</b> and aluminum was found to be the highest producer of iodine gas. The heat output of this mixture and others can be increased by adding more fuel, with the cost of some iodine produced. Products of combustion were analyzed by thermal analysis, XPS, XRD, and LC/MS. Evidence was collected supporting the formation of metal iodides and metal oxides. One key reaction explaining the loss of iodine with increase in aluminum content is the reaction between aluminum and iodine, which forms aluminum triiodide. ^ As seen in multiple cases, including the Boston Marathon bombing, improvised explosives may be as simple as a fuel/oxidizer (FOX) mixture initiated by a hot wire. The knowledge of which materials or compositions are explosive is incomplete, and tests for explosivity are currently conducted at specific scales. For example, ammonium nitrate is classified as an oxidizer because it does not explode at the pound scale, but can become explosive at a larger scale or with a fuel added. Herein, a bomb calorimeter with a pressure transducer has been studied for its use as a small scale metric (2 g) for predicting whether fuel/oxidizer mixtures will be explosive at larger scales. These results have been compared with calculated and measured detonation velocities, and measured air blast pressures. A positive correlation was observed between heat of burning and detonation velocity, and between heat of burning and air blast TNT equivalence. ...|$|R
