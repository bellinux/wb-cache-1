500|$|The duel {{occurred}} as Goebel {{and two of}} his acquaintances went to <b>cash</b> <b>a</b> <b>check</b> in Covington. Goebel suggested they avoid Sanford's bank, but Sanford, standing outside the bank, engaged the trio in conversation before they could cross the street to another bank. As Sanford greeted Goebel's friends, he offered his left hand, his right remaining on a pistol in his pocket. Goebel, noticing this and being likewise armed, clutched the revolver in his own pocket. Sanford asked Goebel, [...] "I understand that you assume authorship of that article?"; [...] "I do", replied Goebel. Witnesses agree that both men fired at each other, but none was sure who fired first. Goebel was uninjured, the bullet passing through his coat and ripping his trousers; Sanford was struck in the head and died five hours later. Goebel was acquitted, pleading self-defense, but the incident would haunt his political career. The acquittal was also significant because of prohibitions against duelling in the Kentucky Constitution. If Goebel had been convicted, he would have been ineligible to hold any public office.|$|E

5000|$|The scammer {{contacts}} {{the victim}} to interest {{them in a}} [...] "work-at-home" [...] opportunity, or asks them to <b>cash</b> <b>a</b> <b>check</b> or money order that for some reason cannot be redeemed locally. In one cover story, the perpetrator of the scam wishes the victim {{to work as a}} [...] "mystery shopper", evaluating the service provided by MoneyGram or Western Union locations within major retailers such as Wal-Mart. The scammer sends the victim a forged or stolen check or money order as described above, the victim deposits it—banks will often credit an account with the value of a check not obviously false— and sends the money to the scammer via wire transfer. Later the check is not honoured and the bank debits the victim's account. Schemes based solely on check cashing usually offer {{only a small part of}} the check's total amount, with the assurance that many more checks will follow; if the victim buys into the scam and cashes all the checks, the scammer can steal a lot in a very short time.|$|E
50|$|Andruet {{was also}} a gambler. Starting in 1993, he {{regularly}} played backgammon and blackjack in casinos and although he initially won significant amounts of money, he eventually became a pathological gambler riddled with debt. On August 22, 1995, Andruet's body {{was found on the}} shores of the Yvette in Saulx-les-Chartreux. He had been beaten to death. The investigation focused on Joseph Liany and his son Franck who had presumably helped Andruet <b>cash</b> <b>a</b> <b>check</b> of 398,000 French francs. Josepth Liany was eventually tried eight years later, convicted of murder and sentenced to a 15-year prison term. His son Franck received a seven-year sentence {{for his role in the}} affair. Joseph Liany subsequently identified his nephew Sacha Rhoul as the man solely responsible for the murder. A new trial in 2006 cleared Liany but convicted Rhoul in absentia. Rhoul had been living in Marrakech where he and his father managed the Palais Rhoul, a well-known luxury hotel. Jean-Claude Andruet, Gilles' father repeatedly called for the arrest and extradition of Rhoul. On February 25, 2010, Moroccan authorities arrested Rhoul following an Interpol mandate and extradited him on March 6. Four years later, Sacha Rhoul was acquitted.|$|E

5000|$|Lorraine Minnite of Demos {{has criticized}} proponents of voter ID laws for {{shifting}} their arguments {{in favor of}} such laws from voter fraud to electoral integrity. In an expert report prepared for the ACLU, she argued that [...] "Calling the problem “electoral integrity” does not change the fact that the only threat to electoral integrity addressed by photo ID laws is in-person voter fraud," [...] and that because such fraud is extremely rare, voter ID laws are not justified to prevent this problem. But in 2005, American University’s Commission on Federal Election Reform, co-chaired by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker, wrote: The electoral system cannot inspire public confidence if no safeguards exist to deter or detect fraud or to confirm the identity of voters. Photo IDs currently are needed to board a plane, enter federal buildings, and <b>cash</b> <b>a</b> <b>check.</b> Voting is equally important.

Conscious and coherent, he tells her to go and immediately <b>cash</b> <b>a</b> <b>check</b> that he has in his wallet. The check is most likely payment for the contents of the van. Anthony has driven the white van to a chop shop he frequents, and as they inspect the van, a number of Cambodian immigrants are discovered locked {{in the back of the}} van, revealing that Choi was involved in human trafficking. Anthony is offered $500 for each person in the van but refuses out of disgust. Whilst resting in her bed, Jean hugs Maria, saying she is the only true friend she has ever had and apologizes. Anthony drives to Chinatown and sets the Cambodian people free. As Anthony drives away, he passes a car crash, which turns out to involve Shaniqua.

5000|$|The Exponents {{first edition}} was {{published}} on December 15, 1889. It was a daily paper from 1906-2016. In 2017, it {{switched to a}} twice-weekly printing schedule. The Web edition (www.purdueexponent.org) was started in 1996. It is the first college newspaper {{in the country to}} build its own building (1989), and one of six college newspapers with its own press. The path to becoming an independent entity began in 1968, when the university removed William R. Smoot II as editor-in-chief. The move followed critical and controversial columns in the newspaper, particularly one on October 23, 1968 that castigated university president Frederick L. Hovde. The university informed Smoot on Friday, Nov. 8, 1968 that he was being removed, but the sixteen editors on the staff refused to accept the dictum. On Saturday, it put out a special edition with a headline, “We Will Still Publish.” By Monday, the headline was more defiant: “Smoot Will Continue: Staff”. University officials claimed that alumni and political pressure {{had nothing to do with}} the move to remove Smoot, but Thomas Graham, a Purdue trustee later said, “Not only did I get a whole bunch of letters, I’d go down to <b>cash</b> <b>a</b> <b>check</b> at the bank and an old friend would grab (me) by the front of the shirt and tell (me), ‘Now dammit, you know right from wrong. Now go up there and get those liberals out of that university.’ … That’s how it’s done here in southern Indiana.” The firing of the editor pushed to the fore the issue of who owned and who was responsible for oversight of the student newspaper. The issue was given to a faculty-student-administrator committee called the Exponent Review Board, but known as the Osmun Commission for its chairman, Dr. John Osmun. Ultimately the Osmun Commission decided over the opposition of administration members that while Hovde had the authority to fire Smoot, the university did not follow due process. Smoot was allowed to remain as editor-in-chief. [...] More important in the long term, the commission recommended that the Exponent become a not-for-profit corporation headed by a publishing board, the Purdue Student Publishing Foundation. Its rent-free use that had been in place since 1933 of windowless offices in the basement of the Purdue Memorial Union would end in 1969.|$|E

Second, we find that an extra day of check-clearing time makes an account holder 14. 3 % more likely to <b>cash</b> <b>a</b> <b>check</b> than to deposit it, implying that consumers are willing to pay an effective annual interest rate of 1127 % to expedite access to their funds.

40|$|The authors outline {{a theory}} of conditionals of the form If A then C and If A then {{possibly}} C. The 2 sorts of conditional have separate core meanings that refer to sets of possibilities. Knowledge, pragmatics, and semantics can modulate these meanings. Modulation can add information about temporal and other relations between antecedent and consequent. It can also prevent the construction of possibilities to yield 10 distinct sets of possibilities to which conditionals can refer. The mental representation of a conditional normally makes explicit only the possibilities in which its antecedent is true, yielding other possibilities implicitly. Reasoners {{tend to focus on}} the explicit possibilities. The theory predicts the major phenomena of understanding and reasoning with conditionals.
