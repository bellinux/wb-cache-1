25|$|The Langmuir {{isotherm}} {{is usually}} better for <b>chemisorption</b> and the BET isotherm works better for physisorption for non-microporous surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Adsorption can be broadly {{classified}} as {{being one of}} two types: physisorption or <b>chemisorption.</b> Physisorption is characterized by weak van der Waals interactions, and bond enthalpies typically less than 20kJ/mol. <b>Chemisorption,</b> alternatively, is defined by stronger covalent and ionic bonds, with bond enthalpies between 250 and 500kJ/mol. In both cases, the adsorbate atoms or molecules (i.e. the particles which adhere to the surface) are attracted to the adsorbent (solid) surface because of the surface energy that results from unoccupied bonding locations at the surface. The degree of orbital overlap then determines if the interactions will be physisorptive or chemisorptive.|$|E
25|$|Activated carbon {{can be used}} as a {{substrate}} for {{the application}} of various chemicals to improve the adsorptive capacity for some inorganic (and problematic organic) compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3), formaldehyde (HCOH), mercury (Hg) and radioactive iodine-131(131I). This property is known as <b>chemisorption.</b>|$|E
30|$|Elovich {{kinetic model}} {{assumes that the}} active sites present on the solid surface are {{heterogeneous}} in nature and have different activation energy for <b>chemisorptions.</b> Generally, this model {{is one of the}} most practical to understand <b>chemisorptions</b> process.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{density of}} states was given for the <b>chemisorptions</b> of atom on the Si (111) surface. From these curves, the characteristics, such as the pseudogap, {{forbidden}} bandwidth, energy curve, the trend of Fermi level in the graphics and the {{density of states}} at the Fermi level and so on, were analyzed and compared to for different elements absorption on the Si (111) surface. The density of states for <b>chemisorptions</b> is different for the different elements...|$|R
40|$|The {{curvature}} {{dependence of}} the physisorptions of H 2   on graphene surface and their barrier to the <b>chemisorptions</b> has been studied. The graphene with steeper curvature can adsorb H 2   stronger due to the more   sp 3   character of the carbon. However, for the negative curvature, the binding strength of the physisorption and the barrier to the <b>chemisorptions</b> are determined by steric repulsion {{as well as the}}   sp 3   character.   </table...|$|R
25|$|CO2 {{can bind to}} the MOF surface through either {{physisorption}} or <b>chemisorption,</b> where physisorption occurs through van der Waals {{interactions and}} <b>chemisorption</b> occurs through covalent bonds being formed between the CO2 and MOF surface. Once the MOF is saturated with CO2, the MOF would then be regenerated (CO2 {{is removed from the}} MOF to be transported elsewhere for sequestration or enhanced oil recovery) through either a temperature swing or a pressure swing. In a temperature swing, the MOF would be heated up until CO2 desorbs; temperature swing regeneration is usually used in post-combustion configurations where the heat is supplied from heat exchangers with the power plant. To achieve working capacities comparable to the amine solvent process, the MOF must be heated up to around 200 C. In a pressure swing, the pressure would be decreased until CO2 desorbs; this would usually be used in a pre-combustion carbon capture configuration.|$|E
25|$|Here (ads) {{refers to}} {{particles}} adsorbed on the catalyst surface and (adj) to particles of silver, directly {{adjacent to the}} oxygen atoms. In this process, 1,2-dichloroethane, vinyl chloride are used as inhibitors so as to prevent further oxidation of ethylene oxide to CO2 and H2O. Here, the chemisorbed chlorine hinders dissociative <b>chemisorption</b> of atomic oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to surface}} tension, {{adsorption}} {{is a consequence}} of surface energy. In a bulk material, all the bonding requirements (be they ionic, covalent or metallic) of the constituent atoms of the material are filled by other atoms in the material. However, atoms {{on the surface of the}} adsorbent are not wholly surrounded by other adsorbent atoms and therefore can attract adsorbates. The exact nature of the bonding depends on the details of the species involved, but the adsorption process is generally classified as physisorption (characteristic of weak van der Waals forces) or <b>chemisorption</b> (characteristic of covalent bonding). It may also occur due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
30|$|Using last {{experimental}} data, Elovich equation {{model was}} verified. The correlation coefficient {{did not show}} good linearity but the constant α and β increase with increasing temperature; thus, {{it can be said}} that both the rate of <b>chemisorptions</b> and availability of adsorption surface would increase.|$|R
30|$|Atomic layer {{deposition}} (ALD) is a {{new type}} of thin film deposition technology based on sequential self-limited and complementary surface <b>chemisorptions</b> reactions using precursor vapor with simple and precision thickness control, large area uniformity, and excellent three-dimensional conformality, especially for deposition of nano-laminated structure [18, 19].|$|R
40|$|Aromatic contaminants, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and 4 -chlorophenol (4 -CP), were photocatalytically {{degraded}} in aqueous solutions under {{visible light}} illumination. 2, 4 -D was degraded more rapidly with {{more amount of}} simultaneous hydrogen generation than 4 -CP. This is due to their difference in oxidative potentials, hydrophobic effects, electrostatic interactions and <b>chemisorptions</b> on the photocatalyst 3 %WO(x) /TiO(2) ...|$|R
25|$|Another {{approach}} to increasing adsorption in MOFs is {{to alter the}} system {{in such a way}} that <b>chemisorption</b> becomes possible. This functionality has been introduced by making a composite material, which contains a MOF and a complex of platinum with activated carbon. In an effect known as hydrogen spillover, H2 can bind to the platinum surface through a dissociative mechanism which cleaves the hydrogen molecule into two hydrogen atoms and enables them to travel down the activated carbon onto the surface of the MOF. This innovation produced a threefold increase in the room-temperature storage capacity of a MOF; however, desorption can take upwards of 12 hours, and reversible desorption is sometimes observed for only two cycles. The relationship between hydrogen spillover and hydrogen storage properties in MOFs is not well understood but may prove relevant to hydrogen storage.|$|E
25|$|Many {{potential}} uses of MOFs exist beyond hydrogen storage, such as gas purification, gas separation, {{gas storage}} (other than hydrogen), and heterogeneous catalysis. MOFs are promising for gas purification because of strong <b>chemisorption</b> {{that takes place}} between electron-rich, odor-generating molecules (such as amines, phosphines, oxygenates, alcohols, water, or sulfur-containing molecules) and the framework, allowing the desired gas {{to pass through the}} MOF. Gas separation can be performed with MOFs because they can allow certain molecules to pass through their pores based on size and kinetic diameter. This is particularly important for separating out carbon dioxide. Regarding gas storage, MOFs can store molecules such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, and oxygen due to their high adsorption enthalpies (similar to hydrogen). In principle, these same MOFs could also be used for catalysis because of their shape and size selectivity and their accessible bulk volume. Also, because of their very porous architecture, mass transport in the pores is not hindered. MOF Technologies Limited a company based in Belfast, United Kingdom are the largest manufacturing company for MOFs.|$|E
2500|$|Nanoparticles are {{valuable}} tools in identification of biomolecules, {{through the use}} of bio-tagging or labeling. Attachments of ligands or molecular coatings to the surface of a nanoparticle facilitate nanoparticle-molecule interaction, and make them biocompatible. Conjugation can be achieved through intermolecular attractions between the nanoparticle and biomolecule such as covalent bonding, <b>chemisorption,</b> and noncovalent interactions ...|$|E
30|$|Carbon dioxide usually adsorbs dissociatively on noble metals, and {{hydrogen}} facilitates adsorption. On supported Ru, Rh and Pd catalysts, <b>chemisorptions</b> of CO 2 {{in the presence}} of hydrogen lead to the formation of surface carbonyl hydride [57]. Dissociation of CO 2 promoted by hydrogen, the dissociation of surface carbonyl hydride into reactive surface carbon, {{and hydrogen}}ation of the latter are proposed as important steps in the hydrogenation process.|$|R
30|$|The {{physical}} adsorption behaviour of PP and APP is well supported by Langmuir’s adsorption isotherm. HCHO treated neem bark and ANB followed <b>chemisorptions</b> nature which is acknowledged by the good correlation of Temkin’s isotherm. SEM and comparative chart of FTIR spectra {{of all the}} four adsorbents are in favour of the results obtained. The second-order kinetic model fitted well with the observed data of all the four adsorbents.|$|R
30|$|A {{negative}} Δ G_ads^∘ {{suggest that}} the adsorption of P(2 ABT) onto the MS surface is a spontaneous process [41] and strongly attracted to MS [42]. Generally, values of Δ G_ads^∘ up to − 20  kJ mol− 1 are consistent with physisorption, while those around − 40  kJ mol− 1 or higher are associated with <b>chemisorptions</b> [43]. So, we suggest from the data in Table  5 that the adsorption is physically in natures.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{commonly}} encountered form of <b>chemisorption</b> in industry, {{occurs when a}} solid catalyst interacts with a gaseous feedstock, the reactant/s. [...] The adsorption of reactant/s to the catalyst surface creates a chemical bond, altering the electron density around the reactant molecule and allowing it to undergo reactions that would not normally be available to it.|$|E
2500|$|Chemical {{cartridge}} respirators use a cartridge {{to remove}} gases, {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), and other vapors from breathing air by adsorption, absorption, or <b>chemisorption.</b> [...] A typical organic vapor respirator cartridge is a metal or plastic case containing from 25 to 40nbsp&grams of sorption media such as activated charcoal or certain resins. [...] The service life of the cartridge varies based, among other variables, on the carbon weight and molecular weight of the vapor and the cartridge media, the concentration of vapor in the atmosphere, the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and the breathing rate of the respirator wearer. [...] When filter cartridges become saturated or particulate accumulation within them begins to restrict air flow, they must be changed.|$|E
2500|$|When {{chlorobenzene}} is hydrodechlorinated over {{nickel and}} silica, highly ordered structures of filamentous carbon form. When potassium and bromine are present, this reaction can occur at temperatures {{as low as}} [...] This is because the potassium and bromine aided in restructuring the active sites, thus causing destructive <b>chemisorption</b> of the reactant and also causing the a precipitate of carbon to form. Adding potassium hydroxide to the mixture of nickel and silica in the reaction made little change to the yield of the reaction. However, the addition of potassium bromide significantly increased the yield. Other alkali metal bromides also allow the reaction {{and the formation of}} filamentous carbon to occur. Such alkali metal bromides include cesium bromide.|$|E

These effects explain why the activity of Mn 2 +-containing iron catalysts is improved...|$|R
2500|$|SAMs {{are created}} by the <b>chemisorption</b> of [...] "head groups" [...] onto a {{substrate}} from either the vapor or liquid phase followed by a slow organization of [...] "tail groups". Initially, at small molecular density on the surface, adsorbate molecules form either a disordered mass of molecules or form an ordered two-dimensional [...] "lying down phase", and at higher molecular coverage, {{over a period of}} minutes to hours, begin to form three-dimensional crystalline or semicrystalline structures on the substrate surface. The [...] "head groups" [...] assemble together on the substrate, while the tail groups assemble far from the substrate. Areas of close-packed molecules nucleate and grow until the surface of the substrate is covered in a single monolayer.|$|E
2500|$|Adsorbate {{molecules}} adsorb readily {{because they}} lower the surface free-energy of the substrate and are stable {{due to the}} strong <b>chemisorption</b> of the [...] "head groups." [...] These bonds create monolayers that are more stable than the physisorbed bonds of Langmuir–Blodgett films. A Trichlorosilane based [...] "head group", for example in a FDTS molecule, reacts with an hydroxyl group on a substrate, and forms very stable, covalent bond [...] with an energy of 452 kJ/mol. Thiol-metal bonds [...] are {{on the order of}} 100 kJ/mol, making them fairly stable in a variety of temperatures, solvents, and potentials. The monolayer packs tightly due to van der Waals interactions, thereby reducing its own free energy. The adsorption can be described by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm if lateral interactions are neglected. If they cannot be neglected, the adsorption is better described by the Frumkin isotherm.|$|E
2500|$|Carbon dioxide adsorbs to a MOF through {{physisorption}} or <b>chemisorption</b> {{based on}} the porosity and selectivity of the MOF leaving behind a Greenhouse gas poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly. The carbon dioxide is then stripped off the MOF using temperature swing adsorption (TSA) or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) so the MOF can be reused. Adsorbents and absorbents require regeneration steps where the [...] {{is removed from the}} sorbent or solution that collected it out of the flue gas in order for the sorbent or solution to be reused. Monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, the leading amine for capturing , have a heat capacity between 3-4 J/g K since they are mostly water. Higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step. Thus, to optimize a MOF for carbon capture, low heat capacities and heats of adsorption are desired. Additionally, high working capacity and high selectivity are desirable in order to capture as much [...] as possible from the flue gas. However, there is an energy trade off with selectivity and energy expenditure. As the amount of [...] captured increases, the energy, and therefore cost, required to regenerate increases. A large drawback of using MOFs for CCS is the limitations imposed by their chemical and thermal stability. Current research is looking to optimize MOF properties for CCS, but it has proven difficult to find these optimizations that also result in a stable MOF. Metal reservoirs are also a limiting factor to the potential success of MOFs.|$|E
30|$|The results {{obtained}} from χ^ 2 analysis {{were presented in}} Table  2. It was evident from the Table  2, that Freundlich isotherm with smaller χ^ 2 value and correlation coefficient much closer to unity described the equilibrium sorption data better than the Langmuir isotherm. This indicates that, the active sites of the adsorbent were heterogeneously distributed and the fluoride adsorption was mainly through <b>chemisorptions</b> process. Similar results were also observed by earlier researchers (Sundaram et al. 2009).|$|R

Recovery of dye on silica was studied from 30 to 90  °C and observed that only 3.5 % was recovered from silica. The less recovery on silica proved the strong adsorption of dye on silica.|$|R
