5|$|Bryant and Milam were {{questioned}} by Leflore County sheriff George Smith. They admitted {{they had taken}} the boy from his great-uncle's yard but claimed they had released him the same night in front of Bryant's store. Bryant and Milam were arrested for kidnapping. Word got out that Till was missing, and soon Medgar Evers, Mississippi state field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Amzie Moore, head of the Bolivar County chapter, became involved. They disguised themselves as cotton pickers {{and went into the}} <b>cotton</b> <b>fields</b> in search of any information that might help find Till.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} period the Mahdi's family became wealthy from cotton {{production}} based on irrigation and migrant laborers, mainly their Baggara followers from Darfur and Kordofan. These western tribes {{had been the}} backbone of the original Mahdist movement. The riverine tribes were more inclined to side with the rival Khatmiyya movement. The government supported Abd al-Rahman in these commercial enterprises. Abd al-Rahman's economic activity, and the resulting wide range of contacts with merchants and owners of pump-schemes for irrigating <b>cotton</b> <b>fields,</b> gave him influence among Sudanese engaged in commerce. As of 1 January 1922 the government suspended payment of allowances to Mahdist notables other than the old and those whose movements were restricted. The allowance of Abd al-Rahman was increased somewhat, but only so that he could support old women and other incapable people whose allowances had been stopped.|$|E
5|$|Some cotton {{crops in}} the Southeast United States {{received}} needed rainfall from Danny, {{while others were}} harmed, as 100,000 acres of <b>cotton</b> <b>fields</b> in Alabama were too heavily damaged for their crop to be salvaged. The effects of Danny caused the gasoline production of Gulf Coast oil refineries to decline and thus contributed {{to an increase in}} gas prices in the months following Danny throughout the United States. A severe drought had been in place in the Mid-Atlantic region during the month of July. The high amount of rainfall caused by Danny helped to ease dry conditions in portions of the Mid-Atlantic, but not sufficiently to stop the drought from developing further in most areas from northern Virginia to southern New England.|$|E

5|$|The film {{shows how}} the demand for cotton in India {{has led to the}} {{planting}} of genetically modified (GM) cotton, and how the monopoly inherent in its use by seed companies causes an increase in the price of cotton, leading to suicides among farmers who lose their land to these companies because they cannot pay the higher seed prices. GM crops need more pesticides, causing environmental damage, birth defects leading to mental and physical disabilities among the Punjab people, and an increased rate of cancer. The film claims that sometimes the companies that produce the pesticides are the same ones that produce the needed medications. A similar scenario occurs in contaminated <b>cotton</b> <b>fields</b> in Texas, where pesticides are causing brain tumors. The garment industry is the second-most-polluting industry the world, according to the film, which is illustrated by leather tanneries pouring chromium into the Ganges River in Kanpur, India.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 Harold Knight {{spent several}} {{months at the}} Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, in America, {{painting}} portrait commissions of surgeons. Laura joined him there and was given permission to paint at the Baltimore Children's Hospital and in the black wards of the racially segregated Johns Hopkins Hospital. Whilst in Baltimore Knight painted a nurse, Pearl Johnson, who took her to meetings and concerts of the early American civil rights movement. Knight also hired a mother and child model to pose for the composition originally known as the Madonna of the <b>Cotton</b> <b>Fields.</b> Knight took these paintings back to London with her and they feature in the Path√© newsreel produced to mark her election as an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1927. Another portrait of Johnson, Irene and Pearl, shows two women {{against a backdrop of}} skyscrapers and was {{one of a number of}} portraits Knight painted in the late 1920s that appear strikingly modern. Miss Ealand, shown at the Royal Academy in 1928, depicts a woman with cropped hair wearing a jacket and holding a gun. The same year Knight's portrait of a women saxophone player was displayed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.|$|E

25|$|Adult weevils overwinter in well-drained {{areas in}} or near <b>cotton</b> <b>fields</b> after diapause. They emerge and enter <b>cotton</b> <b>fields</b> from early spring through midsummer, with peak {{emergence}} in late spring, and feed on immature cotton bolls. The female lays about 200 eggs over a 10- to 12-day period. The oviposition leaves wounds on {{the exterior of the}} flower bud. The eggs hatch in 3 to 5 days within the cotton squares (larger buds before flowering), feed for 8 to 10 days, and finally pupate. The pupal stage lasts another 5 to 7 days. The lifecycle from egg to adult spans about three weeks during the summer. Under optimal conditions, 8 to 10 generations per season may occur.|$|E

What befalls his parents on the <b>cotton</b> <b>field</b> was added for dramatic effect.... Though tension between father and son over civil rights issues fuels most of the drama in the film, Allen's son Charles Allen was not the radical political activist that Gaines's son is in the movie." ...|$|R

25|$|After {{the fall}} of Vicksburg, the Mississippi River from Cairo to the Gulf of Mexico was finally {{in control of the}} Union. As {{northern}} Louisiana, southern Arkansas and eastern Texas, with their vast <b>cotton</b> <b>fields,</b> were still an economic objective, controlling it would not only put millions into the U.S. Treasury, but also deprive the Confederacy of badly needed wartime funds that cotton, with its inflated value, would bring.|$|E
25|$|Out {{of former}} Soviet Union republics Uzbekistan {{continued}} and expanded {{the program of}} child labour on industrial scale to increase profits on {{the main source of}} Islam Karimov's income, cotton harvesting. In September, when school normally starts, the classes are suspended and children are sent to <b>cotton</b> <b>fields</b> for work, where they are assigned daily quotas of 20 to 60kg of raw cotton they have to collect. This process is repeated in spring, when collected cotton needs to be hoed and weeded. In 2006 it is estimated that 2.7 million children were forced to work this way.|$|E

The OD <b>cotton</b> <b>field</b> jacket was redesignated limited standard and issued until supplies were exhausted. Photographic evidence shows that soldiers continued to wear the older jacket {{all the way through the}} end of the war, due to supply shortages and squabbling between the Quartermaster Corps, and field commanders who all had their own ideas of what the troops should [...] "look like".
