5000|$|However, in Australia, the prefix [...] "centi" [...] {{has been}} limited to use with the metre (mainly {{by the general public}} not {{associated}} with the building industry)—unlike in Europe, where the <b>centilitre</b> may often be encountered.|$|E
50|$|Mouten Kop is an amber-coloured beer, style India Pale Ale, with {{an alcohol}} volume of 6% abv and a {{bitterness}} of 35 IBU.The ingredients are barley malt, water, hop, yeast and aromatic spices: coriander, cardamom and orange peel. Mouten Kop is bottle refermented beer. It {{is sold in}} bottles of 33 <b>centilitre.</b>|$|E

50|$|IBA Cocktails are {{measured}} in <b>centilitres</b> (cl) {{rather than the}} more commonly used millilitres (ml).|$|R
50|$|The formula can be {{simplified}} {{for everyday}} use by expressing the serving size in <b>centilitres</b> and the alcohol content literally as a percentage.|$|R
5000|$|The litre (equal to a cubic decimetre), {{millilitre}} (equal to a cubic centimetre), microlitre, {{and smaller}} are common. In Europe, the <b>centilitre</b> {{is often used}} for packaged products (such as wine) and the decilitre less frequently. (The latter two items include prefixes corresponding to an exponent that is not divisible by three.) ...|$|E
50|$|The PET {{line has}} the same shape of the glass bottles. The {{production}} started {{at the end of}} the 1990s with the aim of maintaining the same perlage and effervescence of the glass line. At the beginning, only the 50 centiliters size was produced, but since 2006, the production of the 33 and 75 <b>centilitre</b> bottles were added to the original one.|$|E
5000|$|The 10.7% abv Gulden Draak 9000 Quadruple is a pale quadrupel {{variant of}} the dark brown Gulden Draak. It is named after the postal code (9000) {{of the city of}} Ghent, Belgium. [...] Three {{different}} kinds of malt are used in brewing; for secondary fermentation a wine yeast is used. Gulden Draak is packaged in a black bottle in volumes of 33, 75, and 150 <b>centilitre,</b> and in kegs of 30 litres.|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} rates were 94 % and 90 % respectively. The measurements analysed were an open-ended {{and a set}} of closed-category questions concerning the latest drinking occasion. Results: The set of three closed questions used in 1995 yielded mean amounts of 6. 6 (girls) and 8. 7 (boys) <b>centilitres</b> of pure alcohol whereas the figures obtained from the open question were 8. 5 (girls) and 11. 8 (boys) <b>centilitres.</b> With the closed set extended in 1999 into five questions, the two figures among girls were 7. 7 (closed) and 7. 7 (open) centilitres; the corresponding figures among boys were 11. 3 (closed) and 11. 7 (open) <b>centilitres.</b> Individual level correlations between the two measures among girls were 0. 69 in 1995 and 0. 69 in 1999; and 0. 69 (1995) and 0. 65 (1999) among boys. The numbers of students reporting specific beverage type use were higher when using closed questions compared with an open question. Drunkenness self-reports related logically to amounts of alcohol drunk. Conclusions: The adolescent drinking amount self-reports seem reasonably reliable and valid both on a population and individual level. A set of closed questions may capture the amount drunk even better than an open question...|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} where the metric system was adopted as the official measuring system after the SI standard was established, common usage more closely follow contemporary SI conventions. For example, in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, consumer beverages are labelled almost exclusively using litres and millilitres. Hectolitres sometimes appear in industry, but <b>centilitres</b> and decilitres are rarely, if ever, used. Larger volumes are usually given in cubic metres (equivalent to 1 kL), or thousands or millions of cubic metres.|$|R
5000|$|The {{unofficial}} name of {{the group}} were, while they were based at Ljungbyhed AFB, [...] "En sexa Skåne" [...] which translate to [...] "six <b>centilitres</b> of Skåne Akvavit" [...] in English. Ljungbyhed AFB is situated in the county of Skåne (Scania in English) and Skåne is also a popular kind of Akvavit at the typical Scanian Smorgasbord. There are six airplanes in the group and 6cl is a typical Swedish snaps. The group also terminated some of their shows by doing a snaps glass with smoke in the air.|$|R
50|$|Although {{formerly}} in use, the SI disallows combining prefixes; the microkilogram or centimillimetre, for example, are not permitted. Prefixes {{corresponding to}} powers of one thousand are usually preferred, however, units {{such as the}} hectopascal, hectare, decibel, centimetre, and <b>centilitre,</b> are commonly used. In mathematical contexts, the unit prefixes are always {{considered part of the}} unit, so that, e.g., in exponentiation, 1 km2 means one square kilometre not one thousand square metre and 1 cm3 means one cubic centimetre not one hundredth of a cubic metre.|$|E
5000|$|The litre, {{though not}} an {{official}} SI unit, {{may be used}} with SI prefixes. The most commonly used derived unit is the millilitre, defined as one-thousandth of a litre, and also often referred to by the SI derived unit name [...] "cubic centimetre". It is a commonly used measure, especially in medicine and cooking. Other units {{may be found in}} the table below, where the more often used terms are in bold. However, some authorities advise against some of them; for example, in the United States, NIST advocates using the millilitre or litre instead of the <b>centilitre.</b>|$|E
50|$|Arabic {{coffee is}} usually served {{just a few}} centiliters at a time. The waiter/host serves the guest just {{enough to cover the}} bottom of the cup. Usually, the coffee is boiling hot, so larger amounts would take too long to cool to a {{drinkable}} temperature. The guest drinks it and if he wishes, he will gesture to the waiter not to pour any more. Otherwise, the host/waiter will continue to serve another few <b>centilitres</b> at a time until the guest indicates he has had enough. The most common practice is to drink only one cup since serving coffee serves as a ceremonial act of kindness and hospitality. Sometimes people also drink larger volumes during conversations.|$|R
5000|$|In the SI system, use of prefixes for {{powers of}} 1,000 is {{preferred}} {{and all other}} multiples discouraged. However, in countries where the metric system was established well before {{the adoption of the}} SI standard other multiples were already established, their use remains common. In particular, use of the centi (10−2), deci (10−1), deca (10+1) and hecto (10+2) prefixes are still common. For example, in many European countries, the hectolitre is the typical unit for production and export volumes of beverages (milk, beer, soft drinks, wine, etc.) and for measuring the size of the catch and quotas for fishing boats; decilitres are common in Switzerland and Scandinavia and sometimes found in cookbooks; <b>centilitres</b> indicate the capacity of drinking glasses and of small bottles. In colloquial Dutch in Belgium, a [...] "vijfentwintiger" [...] and a [...] "drieëndertiger" [...] (literally [...] "twenty-fiver" [...] and [...] "thirty-threer") are the common beer glasses, the corresponding bottles mention 25&thinsp;cL or 33&thinsp;cL. Bottles may also be 75&thinsp;cL or half size at 37.5&thinsp;cL for 'artisanal' brews or 70&thinsp;cL for wines or spirits. Cans come in 25&thinsp;cL, 33&thinsp;cL and 50&thinsp;cL a.k.a. 0.5&thinsp;L.|$|R
5000|$|The {{model was}} also {{launched}} in South Africa in 1991, {{where it was}} produced under licence by Delta. The [...] "Kadett" [...] name was retained for the hatchback Astras until 1999. The sedan and station wagon models were offered under the Astra name. The Kadett and Astra in South Africa won the title of 'Car of the Year' in two consecutive years (1994 and 1995) {{even though they were}} versions of the same car. South African nomenclature was denoted in <b>centilitres,</b> so the Astra and Kadett ranges featured 140, 160i, 180i and 200i models. The South African Astra turbo included a variant with the same turbocharged engine called the Opel Kadett 200t S. The 200t S was a specific name where Delta Motor Corporation wanted to show the specialty of the type, which could beat the BMW M3 in a quarter mile in that time. The [...] "t" [...] stands for the turbocharger. The engine (C20LET) in the Opel Astra and Kadett 200t S was sourced from the Opel Calibra and Opel Vectra A 4x4 2.0 16V turbo, four-wheel drive found in European markets, but local engineers converted the six-speed, four-wheel drive transmission (Getrag F28) to front-wheel drive only and as such it was unique to South Africa.|$|R
