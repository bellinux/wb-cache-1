60|$|His first step, {{now that}} he had a supply of ready money for his present necessities, was, to retain his bed at the public-house until further notice, and to write a formal note to Tom Pinch (for he knew Pecksniff would see it) {{requesting}} to have his clothes forwarded to London by coach, with a direction to be left at the office until called for. These measures taken, he passed the interval before the box arrived--three days--in making inquiries relative to American vessels, at the offices of various shipping-agents in the city; and in lingering about the docks and wharves, with the faint hope of stumbling upon some engagement for the voyage, as clerk or supercargo, or custodian of something or somebody, which would enable him to procure a free passage. But finding, soon, that no such means of employment were likely to present themselves, and dreading the consequences of delay, he drew up a short advertisement, stating what he wanted, and inserted it in the leading newspapers. Pending the receipt of the twenty or thirty answers which he vaguely expected, he reduced his wardrobe to the narrowest limits consistent with decent respectability, and carried the overplus at different times to the pawnbroker's shop, for <b>conversion</b> <b>into</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
40|$|New Equipment and {{improvement}} justifications {{are based on}} financial details and alternatives. The datum for all improvements begins {{with the cost of}} the status quo, i. e., no improvement as the launching point for alternatives. Justifications require knowing: 1) when things fail, 2) how things fail, and 3) <b>conversions</b> of failures <b>into</b> <b>money</b> statements. Reliability engineering principles help define when and how things fail to provide facts for life cycle costs comparisons to help decide the lowest long-term cost of ownership driven by a single estimator called net present value (NPV). NPV converts hardware issues and alternatives <b>into</b> <b>money</b> issues. Initial first costs are often a bad decision tool for making improvement decisions (lacking details and alternatives from engineering—the first cost may become the only decision criteria). The Engineering Department is responsibility for providing life cycle costs over the project life and they must provide more than a single alternative for the sales department to get the order. Knowledge about times to failure and failure modes are found by reliability technology. A short example illustrates the methodology. When and How Things Die Reliability engineering is concerned with predicting and avoiding failures—this is a strategi...|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} {{risk management}} {{is one of}} the most important problems in activities of any commercial banks and banking system on the whole. It concerns to the risk of involving a bank in money laundering with the help of conversion centres because, in spite of considerable efforts directed against the legalization of "dirty" cash, there hasn’t been established the effective control system against all these negative facts in the world yet. The problem covered in this article concerning the involvement of banks in the process of illegal <b>conversion</b> of <b>money</b> <b>into</b> cash and methods which counteract this negative fact is a basis for preservation of bank reputation. The topicality of this work is confirmed by the complication of conversion schemes and constant opening of conversion centres by the law enforcing bodies. The regulatory and legal framework of control against criminal income legalization through conversion operations; the disposition of standard acts which regulate these issues are considered there. It is defined the aim of conversion operations accomplishment and how it is achieved by criminals. The main features which describe conversion centres and the necessity of studying the illegal schemes of <b>conversion</b> of <b>money</b> <b>into</b> cash are presented. The author came to the conclusion that the most widespread way of conversion is involvement of banking institutions. It is proved that it’s necessary to study the influence of conversion centres on the activity of not only banking institutions but the economic system on the whole. There are made suggestions as to the detection of conversion schemes through the calculation of indices provided by statistic records; the conducting of field checks of clients’ activities and the implementation of currency control...|$|R
