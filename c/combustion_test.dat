40|$|Single burner <b>{{combustion}}</b> <b>tests</b> play a {{key role}} in the Siemens gas turbine combustion system development process. The main scope of these tests is to assess the performance of combustor design variants in terms emissions or combustion stability at gas turbine relevant operation conditions. Both emissions and combustion stability strongly depend on the flame front and flame position. A pragmatic approach to investigate the flame is to detect the chemiluminescence signal of the combustion intermediate species OH*. Thus, the OH*-chemiluminescence signal was recorded at high-pressure <b>combustion</b> <b>tests</b> to get more insight in the complex interactions between combustor design, operation conditions and combustion performance. To minimize the impact of the measurement system on the combustion behavior, the optical access to the test rig was realized by using a water-cooled probe with an UV-transparent endoscope. The probe was located in the test rig side-wall, downstream of the burner outlet, viewing towards the burner with a 90 ° angle relative to the endoscope orientation. The experimental setup was completed by a combination of bandpass filters and an ICCD camera. During the experiments acoustic pressure oscillations inside the combustion chamber were recorded simultaneously to the chemiluminescence images to allow for phase-sorting of the recorded images during the image post-processing. The postprocessed images then were correlated with the pressure oscillations to investigate the relationship of the heat release to the pressure oscillations. The measurements were carried out during single burner gas turbine <b>combustion</b> <b>tests</b> at realistic gas turbine operation conditions at a scaled pressure of 9 bar. This paper presents selected test results and discusses how they give new insight in the complex combustion processes at full-scale high-pressure gas turbine <b>combustion</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

40|$|Today {{hydrazine}} is {{the commonly}} used monopropellant for attitude- and orbit control of satellites and for powering probes or landers. Due to changing {{political and economic}} framework, (e. g. the REACH regulation in Europe) different propellants for replacing hydrazine are currently under development or qualification.
