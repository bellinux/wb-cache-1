The frame finite element has been developed using a mixed variational principle (complementary form) and using rotations as independent variables. The formulation has been validated for problems of large deflection and rotation, and for problems involving initially <b>curved</b> <b>members.</b> <b>Based</b> on the validation performed, {{it is expected that}} crash problems may be modelled using a single element per member thus retaining computational efficiency while performing an accurate analysis.

Superconic curves recently suggested by A. Greynolds are extensions of both conics and Cartesian ovals and have been applied to optics while they are not extensions of aspheric <b>curves</b> <b>based</b> on conics. In this work, we investigate another kind of superconic curves that are extensions of not only conics and Cartesian ovals but also aspheric <b>curves</b> <b>based</b> on conics.

If the designers' hand-drawn sketches can be realized as real curves, it would be effective in shortening the design period. We have developed a method to extract five degree Bezier <b>curves</b> <b>based</b> on a hand-drawn sketch. The basic techniques to detect <b>curves</b> <b>based</b> on a hand-drawn sketch are described. First, light intensity transformation, binarization of the hand-drawn sketch, and feature based erosion and dilation to smooth {{the edges of the}} binary sketch image are described. Then, line segment determination using the detected edges is described. Using the determined line segments a five degree Bezier curve generation is described. A curve shape modification algorithm is described to reconstruct a five degree Bezier curve. Examples of five degree fair curvature Bezier <b>curves</b> <b>based</b> on a sketch are given...|$|R

40|$|In this report, {{we examine}} several {{possible}} methods for generating PV supply <b>curves</b> <b>based</b> exclusively on rooftop deployment. We begin by introducing a framework methodology for a basic supply <b>curve</b> <b>based</b> on estimated distribution of population and buildings, rooftop availability and orientation, and geographical variation in resource. We then discuss limitations to this basic methodology and introduce alternative supply curves that consider additional factors – changes in PV efficiency and configuration, rooftop availability, and grid limitations – while emphasizing {{the data and}} methodological limitations to each approach. The resulting curves potentially {{could be used as}} inputs to other models or as stand-alone results...|$|R

The scheme extracts digital signature {{from the original}} palette image and embeds {{it back into the}} same palette image, avoiding additional signature file. Digital signature generation is employed using elliptic <b>curve</b> <b>based</b> public key cryptosystem. The performance of elliptic <b>curve</b> <b>based</b> public key cryptosystems is mainly appointed by the efficiency of the underlying finite field arithmetic. Instead of directly sending an original palette image to recipients, only the embedded copy is sent associated with signed digital signature. Experimental results show that security is achieved without sacrificing the image quality...|$|R
