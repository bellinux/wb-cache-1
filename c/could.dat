5|$|A non-safety fougasse <b>could</b> be {{built by}} simply burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads {{would have to}} be left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied <b>could,</b> theoretically, ignite the charge. Also, underground moisture <b>could</b> also easily ruin the charge {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|A {{security}} vulnerability {{was reported}} on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used {{the phone number}} of the sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users <b>could</b> update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing. The vulnerability <b>could</b> be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account. Within {{a few weeks of}} this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number (PIN) that its users <b>could</b> use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.|$|E
5|$|A senator <b>could</b> make a brief statement, {{discuss the}} matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote <b>could</b> be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator <b>could</b> talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they <b>could</b> keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} six venues—the Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range, the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex, the Jawaharlal Nehru Sports Complex, the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, the Siri Fort Sports Complex and the Yamuna Sports Complex—had varying {{capacities}} {{as reflected in the}} table as they <b>could</b> hold their allocated sport(s) in more than one facility. For example, the Yamuna Sports Complex's archery facility <b>could</b> hold 1,500 while its facility for table tennis <b>could</b> hold 4,297.|$|E
5|$|ATC also {{advised that}} I-29 ran North and South just East {{of the airport}} they <b>could</b> land on if they didn't think they <b>could</b> make the runway. The pilot opted to try for the runway instead.|$|E
5|$|According to Baum, even if an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization were {{to communicate}} using electromagnetic signals alone, it <b>could</b> send humanity information with which humans themselves <b>could</b> create lethal biological weapons.|$|E
5|$|Agamemnons first {{target service}} took place before her {{modifications}} were completed. On 19 March 1921, she {{was exposed to}} a cloud of poisonous gas {{to determine the effect}} of gas on a battleship. It was found that gas <b>could</b> penetrate the ship via her various openings, but the ship had not been sealed against gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned battleship <b>could</b> be obtained. On 21 September, she was subjected to machine-gun fire by strafing aircraft. These trials showed that such strafing <b>could</b> harass a battleship, but <b>could</b> not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities, and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA <b>could</b> take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they <b>could</b> not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they <b>could</b> to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they <b>could,</b> but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
5|$|Any (lunatic) person found {{wandering}} {{at large}} or not under proper care and control <b>could</b> be brought before two justices who <b>could</b> order the person's removal to an asylum. The police were usually responsible {{for bringing the}} person before the two justices.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} {{previous}} expansion drafts, players {{from both the}} American League (AL) and National League (NL) were available to the expansion clubs. Each existing club <b>could</b> protect 15 players on their 40-man roster from being drafted and only one player <b>could</b> be drafted from each team in each round. At {{the end of each}} round, NL teams <b>could</b> protect an additional three players and AL teams <b>could</b> protect an additional four. To further protect the AL teams, a maximum of eight AL teams <b>could</b> have three players chosen.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, he conducted experiments which showed that in the fission process, neutrons were emitted. In early 1939 he envisaged {{that a large number}} of fissions <b>could</b> occur and if this happened within a sufficiently short time, then considerable amounts of energy <b>could</b> be released. He went on to calculate that this process <b>could</b> occur in less than a microsecond, and as a consequence would result in an explosion.|$|E
5|$|Cancel the Ground Combat Vehicle – If the Army {{reconditioned}} {{its current}} Bradley instead of replacing them, the current {{capability of the}} IFV fleet <b>could</b> be maintained through 2030. The Army <b>could</b> continue to investigate {{ways to improve the}} current Bradleys, but it would not field any new or improved vehicles. The $24 billion saved in funding <b>could</b> be used on other programs.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on Titan <b>could</b> {{become far}} more {{habitable}} {{in the far}} future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, its surface temperature <b>could</b> rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect {{on the surface and}} enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together <b>could</b> create a habitable environment, and <b>could</b> persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E
5|$|David A. Wheeler's paper How to Prevent {{the next}} Heartbleed {{analyzes}} why Heartbleed wasn't discovered earlier, and suggests several techniques which <b>could</b> {{have led to}} a faster identification, as well as techniques which <b>could</b> have reduced its impact. According to Wheeler, the most efficient technique which <b>could</b> have prevented Heartbleed is an atypical test suite thoroughly performing what he calls negative testing, i.e. testing that invalid inputs cause failures rather than successes. Wheeler highlights that a single general-purpose test suite <b>could</b> serve as a base for all TLS implementations.|$|E
5|$|Defeated enemies {{would drop}} {{two types of}} items: cards, which either {{unlocked}} new characters or allowed the player to boost their characters' stats when increasing their level; and bullets, which <b>could</b> be used on cards that had been increased to their maximum level, to transform them into higher-ranking cards. The player <b>could</b> also find other power-up items scattered in the arenas, which <b>could</b> be used {{to increase the speed}} or strength of their characters, recover health points, or make aiming easier.|$|E
5|$|During single-player segments, {{the player}} <b>could</b> select two AI companions after {{selecting}} missions, which {{added to the}} player's total score {{at the end of}} these missions. During missions, the companions <b>could</b> be issued with Team Commands, which <b>could</b> either order them to attack or increase healing abilities while lowering their defensive capabilities. Each attempt at a mission used up the Cadet's stamina meter, which allowed a maximum of three missions at a time. The game used a job system similar to other entries in the Final Fantasy series, where different equipment and weapons alter a character's abilities in battle. Specific skills accompanied each job. Players <b>could</b> create multiple equipment sets, with each item and weapon ranked according to its rarity in-game. Materials gathered during missions <b>could</b> be used to upgrade the player's equipment and abilities.|$|E
5|$|Fixed {{pairs of}} mine rails were mounted above the stern and each pair <b>could</b> carry five Bréguet B4 mines. These <b>could</b> be {{extended}} using removable section stowed between decks to carry another thirty mines if necessary.|$|E
5|$|Ground that <b>could</b> bear heavy loads.|$|E
5|$|He 111 H-3: Similar to H-2, {{but with}} Jumo 211A-3 engines. Like the H-2, five MG 15 machine guns were standard. One A Stand MG FF cannon <b>could</b> be {{installed}} in the nose and an MG 15 <b>could</b> {{be installed in}} the tail unit.|$|E
5|$|He <b>could</b> deploy as many boats as he chose, {{being paid}} defined {{fees for the}} weight and {{distance}} of goods carried, and for passage of empty boats through each lock. Passenger fees were also defined. He <b>could</b> deploy armed guards to enforce regulations.|$|E
5|$|He {{perceived}} {{books as}} permanent objects that were invested with power. This power was {{unique in that}} it <b>could</b> transmit ideas to people of different times, cultures, and interests, and do so in ways other art forms <b>could</b> not. This ambition laced all of his work, particularly in his later years. Lissitzky was devoted {{to the idea of}} creating art with power and purpose, art that <b>could</b> invoke change.|$|E
5|$|Hetairai <b>could</b> be {{the most}} independent, wealthy, and {{influential}} women in Athens, and <b>could</b> form long-term relationships with rich and powerful men. The most successful hetairai were free to choose their clients, and sometimes became concubines of their former clients.|$|E
5|$|Hewecker, {{the last}} {{criminal}} certificate of division case, declined {{to reconsider the}} question {{on the grounds that}} Rider <b>could</b> have been decided on the narrower ground that a certificate of division <b>could</b> not issue on a matter committed to the district judge's discretion.|$|E
5|$|Huldrych Zwingli, {{a leading}} Protestant Reformer in Switzerland, taught three {{distinct}} baptisms: water baptism, teaching baptism (having been educated about the Christian religion) and Spirit baptism. While full baptism included all three, Zwingli {{emphasized that the}} external baptisms of water and teaching <b>could</b> not provide salvation. The inner baptism of the Spirit alone <b>could</b> save because it conferred faith. According to Zwingli, the three baptisms <b>could</b> be given separately; Spirit baptism <b>could</b> occur first or last in the sequence.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{were made}} to the {{original}} planetarium projector over the years, allowing for special effects that <b>could</b> show close-up displays of specific planets, and the Sun and Moon projectors <b>could</b> replicate the experience of a solar or lunar eclipse.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Bloomberg News {{reported}} that Manning <b>could</b> be visited by only those she had named before her imprisonment, {{and not by}} journalists. She <b>could</b> not be photographed or give interviews on camera. Manning {{was not allowed to}} browse the web, but <b>could</b> consult print news and have access to new gender theory texts.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} Athenian marriages, {{husband or}} wife <b>could</b> legally initiate a divorce. The woman's closest male relative (who {{would be her}} kyrios if she were not married) <b>could</b> also do so, apparently even against the couple's wishes. After divorce, the husband was required to return the dowry or pay 18 percent interest annually so the woman's livelihood would continue and she <b>could</b> remarry. If there were children {{at the time of}} the divorce, they remained in their father's house and he remained responsible for their upbringing. If a woman committed adultery, her husband was legally required to divorce her. A married epikleros would be divorced so she <b>could</b> marry her nearest relative.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it {{due to its}} unique shape, forming a complete meal that <b>could</b> be carried easily and eaten without cutlery. In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry <b>could</b> stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it <b>could</b> easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he <b>could</b> judge the quality of the voice acting since he <b>could</b> not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he <b>could</b> feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment <b>could</b> only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|In {{seeking to}} compete at the Winter Olympics, he set up the Ethiopian National Skiing Federation with his three {{brothers}} so that the sport <b>could</b> be recognised in the country. Teklemariam explained in interviews prior to the Games that he hoped his appearance would inspire other Ethiopians living in colder climates to take up sports. He suggested that cross-country skiing <b>could</b> be a sport that Ethiopians <b>could</b> naturally be proficient at, since it was an endurance sport.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{was given a}} {{customizable}} ship named the Nemesis, commanded by Sterling and his crew. The player's choices in the game would determine the crew they <b>could</b> hire, which in turn affected the ship's attributes. The vessel <b>could</b> be used to explore the Caribbean Sea and battle other crafts. During combat, the player <b>could</b> maneuver the ship, fire the cannons, or board the enemy vessel for hand-to-hand combat. If the enemy craft was boarded and the enemy crew was eliminated, the player received more loot than if it was destroyed. Loot salvaged in these battles <b>could</b> be sold in markets.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} before the FairTax is implemented, there <b>could</b> {{be a strong}} {{incentive}} for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit. After the FairTax is in effect, the credit <b>could</b> be paid off using untaxed payroll. If credit incentives do not change, opponents of the FairTax worry it <b>could</b> exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem. Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect <b>could</b> also allow individuals to pay off their existing (pre-FairTax) debt more quickly, and studies suggest lower interest rates after FairTax passage.|$|E
5|$|In the {{six weeks}} of {{intensive}} combat, RAF strength had been maintained to extent far greater than the Luftwaffe intelligence had believed possible. On the evening of 14 September, Fighter Command <b>could</b> muster 269 Supermarine Spitfire and 533 Hawker Hurricane fighters. The two vital groups <b>could</b> put up just over 500 fighters. No. 11 Group RAF had 310 fighters, including 92 Spitfires and 218 Hurricanes. No. 12 Group RAF <b>could</b> field 85 Spitfires and 109 Hurricanes. Should No. 10 Group RAF come into the battle, a further 48 Spitfires and 78 Hurricanes <b>could</b> be committed. Compared with 17 August, there were just 22 fewer Spitfires and Hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Its major {{components}} were a spaceplane orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which {{was bigger than}} the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was not reused. The shuttle <b>could</b> orbit in altitudes of 185–643km (115–400 miles) and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400kg (54,000lb). Missions <b>could</b> last from 5 to 17 days and crews <b>could</b> be from 2 to 8 astronauts.|$|E
5|$|Jesus {{is called}} a τέκτων (tektōn) in , {{traditionally}} understood as carpenter but <b>could</b> cover makers of objects in various materials, including builders. The gospels indicate that Jesus <b>could</b> read, paraphrase, and debate scripture, {{but this does not}} necessarily mean that he received formal scribal training.|$|E
5|$|Large {{explosive}} eruptions {{have occurred}} in the Southern Volcanic Zone; at least 25 large eruptions occurred in the Holocene; similar, future eruptions <b>could</b> have regional or even hemispheric effects as observed with the 2012 Puyehue-Cordon Caulle eruption. The town of Puerto Cisnes <b>could</b> experience ash falls of over , as <b>could</b> other towns such as Coyhaique. SERNAGEOMIN publishes a volcano hazard level for Mentolat.|$|E
