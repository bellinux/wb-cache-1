It has been claimed that all seventeen {{of these groups}} are represented in the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. Though this is disputed, the variety and sophistication of the Alhambra tilings have surprised modern researchers. Of the three regular tilings two are in the p6m wallpaper group and one is in p4m. Tilings in 2D with translational symmetry in just one direction can be <b>categorized</b> <b>by</b> the seven frieze groups describing the possible frieze patterns. Orbifold notation {{can be used to}} describe wallpaper groups of the Euclidean plane.|$|E
5|$|Lung cancers are {{classified}} according to histological type. This classification {{is important for}} determining management and predicting outcomes of the disease. Lung cancers are carcinomasâ€”malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. Lung carcinomas are <b>categorized</b> <b>by</b> the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope. For therapeutic purposes, two broad classes are distinguished: non-small-cell lung carcinoma and small-cell lung carcinoma.|$|E
40|$|Is {{processing}} of conceptual information as robust as {{processing of}} perceptual information early in development? Existing empirical {{evidence is insufficient}} to answer this question. To examine this issue, 3 - to 5 -year-old children were presented with a flexible categorization task, in which target items (e. g., an open red umbrella) shared category membership with one test item (e. g., a folded umbrella) and perceptual characteristics with another test item (e. g., a red mushroom). Participants were instructed to either <b>categorize</b> stimuli <b>by</b> the same dimension (i. e., perceptual similarity or category membership) in both phases of the task, or switch from <b>categorizing</b> <b>by</b> one dimension to <b>categorizing</b> <b>by</b> the other dimension. Results pointed to a strong asymmetry in switch costs: conceptual switch costs were higher than perceptual switch costs. These results suggest that processing of perceptual information remains more robust than processing of conceptual information at least until 5 years of age...|$|R

5|$|Ceres, the {{asteroid}} belt's only dwarf planet, is about 950km in diameter, whereas 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea have mean diameters {{of less than}} 600km. The remaining bodies range down {{to the size of}} a dust particle. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an asteroid family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within {{the asteroid}} belt are <b>categorized</b> <b>by</b> their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).|$|E

5|$|Breeds {{are often}} <b>categorized</b> <b>by</b> {{the type of}} their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are {{preferred}} for textiles. Most of these were derived from Merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the Corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American Columbia breed was developed by crossing Lincoln rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled Rambouillet ewes.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{established}} that people encode {{the race of}} each individual they encounter, and do so via computational processes {{that appear to be}} both automatic and mandatory. If true, this conclusion would be important, because <b>categorizing</b> others <b>by</b> their race is a precondition for treating them differently according to race. Here we report experiments, using unobtrusive measures, showing that <b>categorizing</b> individuals <b>by</b> race is not inevitable, and supporting an alternative hypothesis: that encoding by race is instead a reversible byproduct of cognitive machinery that evolved to detect coalitional alliances. The results show that subjects encode coalitional affiliations as a normal part of person representation. More importantly, when cues of coalitional affiliation no longer track or correspond to race, subjects markedly reduce {{the extent to which they}} <b>categorize</b> others <b>by</b> race, and indeed may cease doing so entirely. Despite a lifetime's experience of race as a predictor of social alliance, less than 4 min of exposure to an alternate social world was enough to deflate the tendency to <b>categorize</b> <b>by</b> race. These results suggest that racism may be a volatile and eradicable construct that persists only so long as it is actively maintained through being linked to parallel systems of social alliance...|$|R

5|$|War {{film is a}} film genre {{concerned}} with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them. Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often <b>categorized</b> <b>by</b> their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the Second World War. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical. Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{his trip}} to Italy, Jarrell created the {{sculpture}} Tribute to Ovambo Bellows, a conical-shaped painted tribute to the Ovambo people, {{which would be the}} basis for a new shift in his work, towards sculpture. The new works would be <b>categorized</b> <b>by</b> their heavy spiritual nature, reflective of African culture and heritage. Hausa Space - a Village (1993) represents the villages Jarrell visited in Nigeria. The houses that he saw were decorated with icons and symbols of spiritual and ritual meaning, painted in bright colors. These decorations are used to fight evil spirits, while Jarrell's pieces speak for peace. Many of the sculptures blend elements of African art and design; Sorcerer (1993) and Messenger of Information (1993) show his earlier influences from Senufo art and other inspirations related to the design, spirituality and people of Africa. Totemlike sculptures began to be created in 1995. The three sculptures making up the Ensemble series (1995) each stand over five feet tall and are painted with brilliant colors, topped off with a small animal. For the first time, in Days of the Kings (1995), horse racing appears in Jarrell's sculptures. Sixteen totems serve as tributes to African Americans in horse racing, reminiscent of the designs of the Bijogo and Alberto Giacometti. Epiphany (1996) memorializes the Million Man March, held in Washington, D.C. the previous year, an event that Jarrell described {{as one of the most}} important of that century. This piece, and other works, were later exhibited at the 1996 Summer Olympics.|$|E
