In order to identify <b>chatter</b> rapidly and gain the precious time for <b>chatter</b> suppression, a <b>chatter</b> monitoring system was established and an effective feature extraction method for boring <b>chatter</b> recognition was presented.

This study examines whether <b>chatter</b> can predict stock market performance, which metric of <b>chatter</b> has the strongest relationship, {{and what the}} dynamics of the relationship are. The authors aggregate <b>chatter</b> (in the form of product reviews) from multiple websites over a four year period across six markets and fifteen firms. They derive multiple metrics of <b>chatter</b> (volume, positive <b>chatter,</b> negative <b>chatter,</b> and 5 -start ratings) and use multivariate time series models to assess the short and long term relationship between <b>chatter</b> and stock market performance. They use three measures of stock market performance: abnormal returns, risk, and trading volume. The findings reveal that two metrics of <b>chatter</b> can predict abnormal returns with a lead of a few days. Of four metrics of <b>chatter,</b> volume shows the strongest relationship with returns and trading volume, followed by negative <b>chatter.</b> Whereas negative <b>chatter</b> has a strong effect on returns and trading volume with a short “wearin” and long “wearout,” positive <b>chatter</b> has no effect on these metrics. Negative <b>chatter</b> also increases volatility (risk) in returns. A portfolio analysis of trading stocks based on their <b>chatter</b> provides a return of 8 % over and above normal market returns. In addition to the investing opportunities, the results show managers that <b>chatter</b> is an important metric to follow to gauge the performance of their brands and products. Because <b>chatter</b> is available daily and hourly, it 2 can provide an immediate pulse of performance that is not possible with infrequent sales and earnings reports. The fact that negative <b>chatter</b> is more important than positive, indicates that negatives are more diagnostic than positives.

2500|$|Babbling-like {{behavior}} in songbirds, humans and some nonhuman primates {{has been previously}} researched, {{but it has not}} been researched until recently in non-primate mammals. [...] The sac-winged bat (Saccopteryx bilineata) is a social creature and the vocalizations that it produces depend on the social situation that the animal is in. This bat has a large repertoire of vocalizations with males being more vocal than females. Echolocation pulses, barks, <b>chatters,</b> and screeches are used in various social situations including courtship and territorial defense. Infants produce isolation calls if their mothers are absent, but the pups also produce vocalizations that mirror those of adults. Both sexes of infants babble, even though as an adult, the vocalizations are solely produced by males. Social context, mothers, and surrounding bats do not influence pups because the multiple vocalizations are combined regardless of the situation. Since there is not a social aspect correlated with the vocalizations, the productions of the sounds suggest that the pups vocalize for training. The pups repeat and combine adult vocalizations so that they resemble babbling in what humans, other primates and some songbirds do as infants. However, while human babbling increases social interactions, there are no social responses to babbling in bats. Babbling is common in infants that have a large repertoire of adult vocalizations to learn and this is seen in the pups of sac-winged bat.|$|E

40|$|AbstractChatter {{detection}} {{is necessary}} to carry out stable machining. It is extremely critical in high speed micromilling (spindle speeds > 100, 000 rpm) where the limited tool stiffness and small fluctuations in the cutting forces can lead to dynamic instability. <b>Chatter</b> can deteriorate the surface finish and is detrimental to the tool as well. Hence, <b>chatter</b> identification is important to obtain stable cutting parameters. This <b>chatter</b> free process parameters can be identified by carrying out experiments at different machining conditions. <b>Chatter</b> detection can be accomplished via in-process real time techniques based on force and displacement signals or off-line machined surface characterization. It may be noted that micromilling process uses a miniature end mill whose natural frequencies corresponding to higher modes can {{be as high as}} 10 KHz. Consequently, the sensor bandwidth should be sufficient to detect high <b>chatter</b> frequencies in high speed micromilling. The conventional way of detecting <b>chatter</b> via force sensor may not be applicable in high speed micromilling due to its limited bandwidth. The displacement sensors can also have issues with proper placement and the noise. The <b>chatter</b> surface identification is relatively easy via visual inspection of the surface topography but quantitatively specifying a surface parameter which captures <b>chatter</b> is challenging. To address the issues of <b>chatter</b> identification in high speed micromilling, three different experimental techniques have been studied for <b>chatter</b> characterization. Four different experimental conditions (two stable and two unstable processing conditions based on visual surface inspection of scanning electron micrographs) have been characterized by all three methods and a comparative assessment of different <b>chatter</b> detection techniques has been carried out in high speed micromilling of Ti 6 Al 4 V. It has been observed that force sensor is unable to identify the <b>chatter</b> and the displacement sensor is noisy but can be used to determine <b>chatter</b> under certain conditions. However, average power spectral density (APSD) obtained from the surface topography can clearly identify <b>chatter.</b> A critical average power spectral density has been identified for the determination of the onset of <b>chatter...</b>|$|R

Detecting {{the negative effects}} of <b>chatter</b> requires improved <b>chatter</b> detection techniques. The vibration signals collected from grinders are mainly nonstationary, nonlinear and multidimensional. Hence, bivariate empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) has been investigated as a multiple signal processing method.

However the material removal rate (MRR) is often limited by the occurrence of <b>chatter.</b> <b>Chatter</b> is a heavy vibration of the cutter, which results in a non-smooth workpiece surface, rapid tool wear and noise [1]. Therefore, to maximise production rates, the maximum MRR should be found where no <b>chatter</b> occurs.
