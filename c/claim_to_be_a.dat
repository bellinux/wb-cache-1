5|$|In 793 the {{vulnerability}} of the English east coast was exposed when the monastery at Lindisfarne was looted by Vikings and a year later Jarrow was also attacked, events which Steven Plunkett reasons would ensure that the East Anglians were governed firmly. Æthelberht's <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> king descended from the Wuffingas dynasty (suggested by the use of a Roman she-wolf and the title REX on his coins) could be because of a need for strong kingship {{as a result of the}} Viking attacks.|$|E

The bears are donated to charities throughout the Calgary area. A few of the bears are personally delivered by the players to the Alberta Children's Hospital, an event highly anticipated by patients attending the hospital.|$|E

5|$|So {{long as we}} exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} {{speak on behalf of}} or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E

Ghulam Ahmad's <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> subordinate (ummati) prophet within Islam has remained a central point of controversy between his followers and mainstream Muslims, who believe Muhammad {{to be the last}} prophet and await the physical return of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|More {{than one}} third of the content of The Urantia Book is devoted to a {{narrative}} of the life and teachings of Jesus, and the Judeo-Christian tradition is given an importance exceeding any other.

25|$|Native Americans {{view the}} whiteshaman {{with a mix}} of humor and contempt. It is not just the simple act of going outside their culture that is {{upsetting}} to Native Americans, but that they are misrepresenting the true Indian culture (their images are shadows of the true Indian style).

25|$|Post-modernism was {{introduced}} to Urdu literature by Gopi Chand Narang. Many other critics in Urdu literature are also attached to this approach to criticism. Post-modernism does not <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> movement and does not demand any writer to adopt a particular style of writing. It generally concentrates on a method of understanding contemporary literature {{in the light of}} its content—mostly examining features like feminism, dalit, regional and other types of literature as opposed to seeking uniformity in the global literature on the basis of internationally established trends.|$|E

25|$|The 19th century {{recognition}} of Mark as the earliest gospel {{led to the}} belief that it must therefore be the most reliable. This conclusion was refuted by two works published {{in the early decades of}} the 20th century: in 1901 William Wrede argued that Mark's sequence of episodes is in fact an artificial construct with theological motivation; and in 1919 Karl Ludwig Schmidt showed how the links between the episodes are the invention of the writer, thus undermining the gospel's <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reliable guide to the chronology of Jesus' mission. The modern consensus is that Mark's purpose was to present a theological message rather than to write history.|$|E
25|$|The {{first chapter}} of the Qayyúmu'l-Asmá' ("Tafsir on the Surah Yusuf") was written by the Báb {{on the evening of}} his {{declaration}} to Mullá Husayn, on the evening of May 22, 1844. The entire work, which is several hundred pages in length and is considered to be revelation by Bahá'ís, required forty days to write; {{it is one of the}} Báb's longer Arabic works. It was widely distributed in the first year of the Bábí movement, functioning as something of a Qur'an or Bible for the Bábís. In the book the Báb states his <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Manifestation of God, though the claim is disguised with other statements that he is the servant of the Hidden Imám. Táhirih translated the work into Persian.|$|E
25|$|Clone {{phishing}} {{is a type}} of {{phishing attack}} whereby a legitimate, and previously delivered, email containing an attachment or link has had its content and recipient address(es) taken and used to create an almost identical or cloned email. The attachment or link within the email is replaced with a malicious version and then sent from an email address spoofed to appear to come from the original sender. It may <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> resend of the original or an updated version to the original. This technique could be used to pivot (indirectly) from a previously infected machine and gain a foothold on another machine, by exploiting the social trust associated with the inferred connection due to both parties receiving the original email.|$|E

25|$|Gasparotto and Moduco {{would not}} be the only victims of Montefalco's investigations, however, for during late 1581 he had heard of a widow living in Udine named Anna la Rossa. While she did not <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> benandante, she did claim that she could see and {{communicate}} with the spirits of the dead, and so Montefalco had her brought in for questioning on 1 January 1582. Initially denying that she had such an ability to the inquisitor, she eventually relented and told him of how she believed that she could see the dead, and how she sold their messages to members of the local community willing to pay, using the money in order to alleviate the poverty of her family. Although Montefalco intended to interrogate her again at a later date, the trial ultimately remained permanently unfinished.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before the}} season began, Vibhaji died; his 12-year-old son Jaswantsinhji officially succeeded to the throne on 10 May, while Ranjitsinhji was playing for Sussex against the MCC, taking the new name Jassaji. The British {{appointed}} an Administrator to rule until he reached an appropriate age to assume the responsibility of a ruler. As Ranjitsinhji's fame increased throughout 1895, journalists pressed {{for more information on}} his background. Some stories circulated that his father was the ruler of an Indian state and that he had been deprived of his rightful position as ruler of Nawanagar; despite his protestations that this was not correct, it is likely that Ranjitsinhji was the source of these stories. It is possible he began planning to contest the position, prompted by the enquiries of the press and his <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> prince.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} Cossacks, some {{refuse to accept}} {{themselves}} {{as part of the}} standard ethnic Russian people, and <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> separate subgroup on par with sub-ethnicities such as the Pomors. In the 2002 Russian census the Cossacks were allowed to a have distinct nationality as a separate Russian sub-ethnical group. The Kuban Cossacks living in Krasnodar Kray, Adygea, Karachayevo-Cherkessia and some regions of Stavropol Krai and Kabardino-Balkaria counted 25,000 men. However, the strict governance of the census meant that only Cossacks who are in active service were treated as such, {{and at the same time}} 300,000 families are registered by the Kuban Cossack Host. Kuban Cossacks not politically affiliated with the Kuban Cossack Host, such as the director of the Kuban Cossack Choir Viktor Zakharchenko, have maintained at various times a pro-Ukrainian orientation. Zakharchenko has recently changed his position and proposes a unification of Ukraine and Russia.|$|E
