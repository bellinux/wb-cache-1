Brunelleschi was aware that a dome of enormous proportion could in fact be engineered without a keystone. The dome in Florence is supported by the eight large ribs and sixteen more internal ones holding a brick shell, with the bricks arranged in a herringbone manner.

25|$|De Re Aedificatoria, {{written by}} Leon Battista Alberti around 1452, {{recommends}} vaults with <b>coffering</b> for churches, {{as in the}} Pantheon, and the first design for a dome at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is usually attributed to him, although the recorded architect is Bernardo Rossellino. This would culminate in Bramante's 1505–06 projects for a wholly new St. Peter's Basilica, marking {{the beginning of the}} displacement of the Gothic ribbed vault with the combination of dome and barrel vault, which proceeded throughout the sixteenth century. Bramante's initial design was for a Greek cross plan with a large central hemispherical dome and four smaller domes around it in a quincunx pattern. Work began in 1506 and continued under a succession of builders over the next 120 years. The dome was completed by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana. The publication of Sebastiano Serlio's treatise, {{one of the most popular}} architectural treatises ever published, was responsible for the spread of the oval in late Renaissance and Baroque architecture throughout Italy, Spain, France, and central Europe.|$|E
500|$|A private {{staircase}} {{between the}} Parlour and the Withdrawing Room {{leads to the}} first floor. The Withdrawing Room has 16th-century carved wooden panelling, and a wooden ceiling with moulded <b>coffering,</b> which probably dates from 1559 when the Great Hall ceiling was added. The bay window in this room was also added in 1559, {{at the same time}} as the one in the Great Hall. The pair of windows bear the following inscription underneath their gables: ...|$|E
500|$|Beyond the {{vestibule}} {{is a wide}} aisled nave,seven bays long, its barrel-vaulted ceiling painted with trompe-l'œil <b>coffering</b> ("not very convincingly" [...] according to the Buildings of England guide), a chancel and a side chapel. The nave and aisles are separated by painted marble-effect stone Doric columns, which were originally partly panelled, They support a horizontal entablature rather than the more usual arches. The strict geometry of the interior – each bay of the aisles is a square, and the nave is three times wider than each aisle – gives it an [...] "austere Neoclassical appearance" [...] not normally associated with the Georgian era {{in which it was}} built.|$|E
500|$|During {{the reign}} of Emperor Trajan, domes and semi-domes over exedras were {{standard}} elements of Roman architecture, possibly due {{to the efforts of}} Trajan's architect, Apollodorus of Damascus, who was famed for his engineering ability. Two rotundas [...] in diameter were finished in 109 AD as part of the Baths of Trajan, built over the Domus Aurea, and exedras [...] wide were built as part of the markets north-east of his forum. The architecture of Trajan's successor, Hadrian, continued this style. Although considered an example of Hadrianic architecture, there is brickstamp evidence that the rebuilding of the Pantheon in its present form was begun under Trajan. Speculation that the architect of the Pantheon was Apollodorus has not been proven, although there are stylistic commonalities between his large coffered half-domes at Trajan's Baths and the dome of the Pantheon. Three [...] wide exedras at Trajan's Baths have patterns of <b>coffering</b> that, as in the Pantheon, align with lower niches only on the axes and diagonals and, also as in the Pantheon, that alignment is sometimes with the ribs between the coffers, rather than with the coffers themselves.|$|E
500|$|The shallow <b>coffering</b> in {{the dome}} {{accounts}} for a less than five percent reduction in the dome's mass, and is mostly decorative. The aggregate material hand-placed in the concrete is heaviest {{at the base of}} the dome and changes to lighter materials as the height increases, dramatically reducing the stresses in the finished structure. In fact, many commentators have cited the Pantheon as an example of the revolutionary possibilities for monolithic architecture provided by the use of Roman pozzolana concrete. However, vertical cracks seem to have developed very early, such that in practice the dome acts as an array of arches with a common keystone, rather than as a single unit. The exterior step-rings used to compress the [...] "haunches" [...] of the dome, which would not be necessary if the dome acted as a monolithic structure, may be an acknowledgement of this by the builders themselves. Such buttressing was common in Roman arch construction. The cracks in the dome can be seen from the upper internal chambers of the rotunda, but have been covered by re-rendering on the inner surface and by patching on the outside. The Pantheon's roof was originally covered with gilt bronze tiles, but these were removed in 663 by Emperor Constans II and replaced with lead roofing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} was also Japanese-influenced. The hall's {{walls and ceiling}} were paneled in dark, mahogany <b>coffering,</b> with a narrow, latticed stair {{in the center of}} the room rising steeply like a ship's gangway. Surrounding this are blue-and-white, Delft-tile murals and a Jacobean chimneypiece [...] gifts from the Queen of the Netherlands, in gratitude for one of Griscom's ships helping to rescue a Dutch ship that was sinking. The hall's ceiling has a large rectangular cut-out, framed by a latticed railing, that allows natural light to stream down from second-story windows.|$|E
2500|$|Sangallo's plan (1513), {{of which}} a large wooden model still exists, looks to both these predecessors. He {{realised}} the value of both the <b>coffering</b> at the Pantheon and the outer stone ribs at Florence Cathedral. He strengthened and extended the peristyle of Bramante {{into a series of}} arched and ordered openings around the base, with a second such arcade set back in a tier above the first. In his hands, the rather delicate form of the lantern, based closely on that in Florence, became a massive structure, surrounded by a projecting base, a peristyle and surmounted by a spire of conic form. According to James Lees-Milne the design was [...] "too eclectic, too pernickety and too tasteless to have been a success".|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} of the post office is built primarily of marble and of hardwoods. Its ceiling is constructed primarily of heavily contrasting marble <b>coffering.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{prominent}} {{example of}} Roman <b>coffering,</b> employed {{to lighten the}} weight of the dome, {{can be found in the}} ceiling of the rotunda dome in the Pantheon, Rome.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{excavated}} by Pietro Rosa in 1850 who reconstructed a single marble column and travertine supports. In 1852 segments of concrete vaulting with stuccowork <b>coffering</b> was unearthed but later destroyed in 1872.|$|E
50|$|The plan of {{the upper}} church is almost a Greek cross with nearly equal arms and the centre is crowned by the dome. Large Ionic columns, {{supporting}} a large entablature, cluster around the crossing and populate the wall spaces of the apsidal transepts, choir and nave. The windows in the apsidal vaults are each surmounted by a split pediment with a head in a scallop shell with octagonal <b>coffering</b> above, motifs which Cortona used in his fresco painting. However, apart from the altarpieces, the interior is white stucco; a surprising design decision for a church dedicated to {{the patron saint of}} painting (St. Luke), built for the painting academy in Rome and by a painter who had decorated some of the most opulent church vaults in Rome such as Santa Maria in Vallicella. The interior dome decoration has been attributed to Cortona's pupil and collaborator, Ciro Ferri; ribs and <b>coffering</b> are combined as they are at Santa Maria della Pace but here the forms of the <b>coffering</b> are far more fluid and almost shimmer with movement.|$|E
50|$|The oval entablature to {{the dome}} has a 'crown' of foliage and frames {{a view of}} deep set {{interlocking}} <b>coffering</b> of octagons, crosses and hexagons which diminish in size the higher they rise. Light floods in from windows in the lower dome that are hidden by the oval opening and from windows {{in the side of}} the lantern. In a hierarchical structuring of light, the illuminated lantern with its symbol of the Holy Trinity is the most brightly lit, the <b>coffering</b> of the dome is thrown into sharp and deep relief and light gradually filters downwards to the darker lower body of the church.|$|E

50|$|Between {{the gallery}} of portraits and the frieze of the <b>coffering,</b> {{the walls are}} adorned with a celebrated series of frescoes by Juan de Borgoña.

50|$|The interior, {{which can}} be reached from the {{original}} fifteenth-century door, has a short nave with cruciform vaulting and a tribune surmounted by a cupola. Cortona articulated {{the interior of the}} dome with octagonal <b>coffering</b> and a series of ribs radiating from the lantern. This is an early example of combining these two forms of dome decoration and was employed by Gianlorenzo Bernini in his later churches at Ariccia and Castelgandolfo.|$|E
5000|$|A coffer (or <b>coffering)</b> in {{architecture}} {{is a series}} of sunken panels {{in the shape of a}} square, rectangle, or octagon in a ceiling, soffit or vault. [...] A series of these sunken panels was often used as decoration for a ceiling or a vault, also called caissons ('boxes"), or lacunaria ("spaces, openings"), so that a coffered ceiling can be called a lacunar ceiling: the strength of the structure is in the framework of the coffers.|$|E
5000|$|Antoine Desgodetz's {{publication}} Les edifices antiques de Rome dessinés et mesurés très exactement (Paris 1682) {{with its}} engravings of the monuments and antiquities of Rome, provided suitable architectural details based on illustrations {{in this book}} for rooms including: The Marble Hall the columns of {{which are based on}} those of the Temple of Fortuna Virilis the <b>coffering</b> is based on the Pantheon, The Statue Gallery exedra are based on those at the Temple of Venus and Roma, in the Saloon the <b>coffering</b> of the cove is copied from the Basilica of Maxentius and the ceiling freize in the Drawing Room is from the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. Daniele Barbaro's translation with extended commentary of the De architectura (Ten books of Architecture) by Vitruvius, contains a woodcut interpretation of a plan of Vitruvius's Roman House and was in part the inspiration for the Marble Hall, especially the atrium which is shown flanked by six columns and with a coffered ceiling. Matthew Brettingham the younger stated that the concept for the Marble Hall was Lord Leicester's, inspired by [...] "Palladio's example of a Basilica, or tribunal of justice, exhibited in his designs for Monsignor Barbaro's translation of Vitruvius".|$|E
50|$|The Upper Tribune is an {{octagonal}} room surmounted with {{a central}} dome. The dome has octagonal <b>coffering</b> of a type derived from the Basilica of Maxentius. The half-moon lunette windows below the dome are called 'Thermal' or 'Diocletian' windows. Their use at Chiswick {{was the first in}} northern Europe. Running beneath the Diocletian windows in the frieze are several lion heads, a feature also associated with the Diocletian bath houses, with Old St Paul's Cathedral under Inigo Jones, and with the Temple of Jerusalem.|$|E
50|$|Between 1000 and 1200 AD the romanesque style {{became popular}} across Europe. While {{the name of}} the romanesque era refers to the {{tradition}} of roman architecture, it was actually a West- and Central European trend. Romanesque buildings appear rather bulky and compact. Typical features are circular arches, round or octagonal towers and cushion capitals on the pillars. In the early romanesque era, <b>coffering</b> on the ceiling was fashionable, while later in the same era, groined vault was more popular. The rooms became wider and the motivs of sculptures became more epic.|$|E
50|$|In 1864, in {{accordance}} with legislation sponsored by Representative Justin Morrill, Congress invited each state to contribute two statues of prominent citizens for permanent display in the room, which was renamed National Statuary Hall. The legislation also provided for {{the replacement of the}} chamber's floor, which was leveled and covered with the marble tile currently in the Hall. This modification, along with the replacement of the original wooden ceiling (which was painted to simulate three-dimensional <b>coffering)</b> with the present one in the early 20th century, eliminated most of the echoes that earlier plagued the room.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} was also Japanese-influenced.

50|$|Major {{works of}} {{restoration}} began in 1912 {{under the auspices}} of the state. Fragments of stone which had fallen from the portal were returned to place, the whole north wall of the choir was rebuilt and both the cross-vaulting of the aisles and the <b>coffering</b> of the nave were done away with. The walls of the crypt and its access stair were also rebuilt. In a later restoration the pavements of the nave and crypt were raised and remade using slabs of local stone. In the early 1990s structural works were undertaken to secure the building and its campanile.|$|E
5000|$|Beyond the {{vestibule}} {{is a wide}} aisled nave,seven bays long, its barrel-vaulted ceiling painted with trompe-l'œil <b>coffering</b> ("not very convincingly" [...] according to the Buildings of England guide), a chancel and a side chapel.

5000|$|Possibly {{the best}} known {{building}} in Valleseco can be found here; the Saint Vicente Ferrer's Temple. Of simple construction, {{it is also the}} oldest building in Valleseco (1898), highlighting the pulpit and the <b>coffering</b> in its interior, built in mudejar style. There are also some images of great historical and artistic value that come from the old chapel that preceded this church, and a reliquary, containing part of a bone of the saint's arm, is venerated. The greatest reliquary, however, is a German organ from the 18TH century which came from the Church of the Pino in Teror and which has been recently restored/ ...|$|E
5000|$|The bank is a terraced ashlar {{building}} in Gothic Revival style, with two storeys and seven bays. Nikolaus Pevsner {{describes it as}} [...] "later, smoother, equally Gothic" [...] by comparison with the nearby District Bank, which was designed by Alfred Waterhouse. Its roof of Westmorland green slate is described by local historian Jane Stevenson as [...] "beautiful". A band between ground and first floor is decorated with rectangular <b>coffering,</b> which matches the dentilled cornice under the eaves. There are also two plain stone bands, one {{on the ground floor}} beneath the windows and the other on the first floor {{at the level of the}} window heads.|$|E
50|$|Designed by Alexander Briullov {{following}} the Winter Palace fire of 1837, {{the room is}} decorated in the neoclassical style fashionable in the early 19th century, known as Pompeian. A ceiling, with a low segmental barrel vault with bands of shallow <b>coffering</b> stuccoed with classical motifs, is seemingly supported by a colonnade of engaged fluted Greek Doric columns with enriched echinus molding and no bases. A Greek key fret enriches the entablature that runs without a break round the room. The only furnishings were the dining chairs of Greek klismos type, formally ranged round the walls. When the Imperial family were to dine here, dining tables would be brought in, covered and laid, then removed afterwards.|$|E
50|$|The Hieronymites are an Augustinian order. The monastery church {{follows the}} usual plan for churches of this order, a Latin Cross with an {{elevated}} choir {{at the foot}} and the altar behind a wide staircase. The mannerist altarpiece of the main chapel is considered the point of departure of Andalusian sculpture as such; it is mainly the work of Pablo de Rojas. The richly decorated Renaissance interior features <b>coffering,</b> scalloping and sculptures, and is a late work of Renaissance humanism. The iconographic program highlights {{the military and the}} heroic grandeur of the Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, known as the Gran Capitán ("Great Captain"), who is buried in the crossing with his wife, Doña Maria de Manrique.|$|E
50|$|The vaults are {{decorated}} with frescoes (1907) by Giovanni da Ferraboschi of Bergamo, depicting the main incidents {{of the lives of}} Saints Peter and Paul, with relief decoration on <b>coffering</b> using classical motifs such as rosettes, leaves, heraldic emblems (a papal tiara and a bishop's mitre), as well as Celtic knotwork with grotesque faces. The decorations {{on the walls of the}} cathedral, including simulated inlaid polychrome marble, were made at the end of the 1950s by the decorator Enrico Lorrai of Cagliari (1908-1995). The floors have almost all been remade, firstly between 1950 and 1962 during the episcopate of Bishop Antonio Tedde and secondly between 1983 and 2003 during the episcopates of Bishops Gibertini and Orrù.|$|E
5000|$|Sangallo's plan (1513), {{of which}} a large wooden model still exists, looks to both these predecessors.

50|$|De Re Aedificatoria, {{written by}} Leon Battista Alberti and {{dedicated}} to Pope Nicholas V around 1452, recommends vaults with <b>coffering</b> for churches, {{as in the}} Pantheon, and the first design for a dome at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is usually attributed to him, although the recorded architect is Bernardo Rossellino. Under Pope Nicholas V, construction started between 1451 and 1455 on {{an extension of the}} old St. Peter's Basilica to create a Latin cross plan with a dome and lantern 100 braccia high over a crossing 44 braccia wide (about 24.5 meters wide). Little more than foundations and part of the choir walls were completed before work stopped with the death of Nicholas V. This innovation would culminate in Bramante's 1505-6 projects for a wholly new St. Peter's Basilica, and throughout the sixteenth century the Renaissance set of dome and barrel vault would displace use of Gothic ribbed vaults.|$|E
50|$|The {{church has}} medieval origins: it {{probably}} {{dates back to}} the papacy of Leo IV in 9th century. However, the former documents attesting its existence are papal bulls promulgated in 1198 and 1228, when the church was declared a branch of St. Peter's Basilica by Pope Innocent III. In 12th century Pope Innocent IV allowed it to the Sylvestrine Congregation; in 1620 the Vatican Chapter entrusted the church to the Franciscans and then to the Penitent Nuns, which, in 1644, charged Luigi Arrigucci (1575-1644) with the restoration of the building: because of these restorations, the church lost its basilican layout with three naves and became a single nave church with <b>coffering</b> on the ceiling. In the same period the nuns also built the annexed cloister, devoted to the prostitutes wishing to change their life; the cloister was demolished in 1887, during the building of the Lungotevere. In the same period the church, after having suffered 15 years of abandon and risked itself the destruction, was finally renovated.|$|E
50|$|The stone coffers of {{the ancient}} Greeks and Romans are the {{earliest}} surviving examples, but a seventh-century BC Etruscan chamber tomb in the necropolis of San Giuliano, which is cut in soft tufa-like stone reproduces a ceiling with beams and cross-beams lying on them, with flat panels filling the lacunae. For centuries, {{it was thought that}} wooden coffers were first made by crossing the wooden beams of a ceiling in the Loire Valley châteaux of the early Renaissance. In 2012, however, archaeologists working under Andrew Wallace-Hadrill at the House of the Telephus in Herculaneum discovered that wooden coffered ceilings were constructed in Roman times. Experimentation with the possible shapes in <b>coffering,</b> which solve problems of mathematical tiling, or tessellation, were a feature of Islamic as well as Renaissance architecture. The more complicated problems of diminishing the scale of the individual coffers were presented by the requirements of curved surfaces of vaults and domes.|$|E
