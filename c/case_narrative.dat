50|$|It {{was unclear}} {{for a long}} time whether or not there had been {{chemical}} weapons at Khamisiya, partly because of an alternate name used by the Iraqi military (Tal al Lahm), and partly because there were other munitions storage locations in the area, including Talil Air Base and in the nearby town of An Nasiriyah. By 1996, it became clear to the Department of Defense that nerve agents were present at the Khamisiya storage facilities. In April 2002, the United States Department of Defense released two reports related to operations at Khamisiyah during the Gulf War. The first report is a final version of its <b>case</b> <b>narrative</b> U.S. Demolition Operations at Khamisiyah. The second was a technical report detailing the modeling and risk characterization of possible chemical-warfare-agent exposure in the Gulf War.|$|E

40|$|The need {{to develop}} new models for {{preparation}} of school administrators has been a prominent concern in educational discourse in the last decade. Having been criticized for the inadequate preparation of the school leadership cadre, academic departments responsible for training future school administrators have had to revisit their approaches and to reframe their teaching philosophies to ensure the readiness of their graduates for the challenges and complexities of school leadership. This article reports on the new model of principals' training {{that has been used}} in York University's Principals' Qualification Program (PQP) from the late 1990 s onward. One component of the program brings traditional case methodology into a computer-mediated/on-line environment. The on-line <b>cases</b> are <b>narratives</b> from the everyday lives of the Ontario school administrators who serve as mentors in the on-line environment. Situating our discussion {{within the context of the}} rapidly changing educational landscape of Ontario, we focus on the PQP model to explore experientially generated <b>case</b> <b>narratives</b> as one method for teaching and learning the work of the local school administrator. We focus particularly on the teaching and learning embedded in computer-mediated or on-line <b>case</b> <b>narratives</b> used in training teachers for school leadership. We argue that the complexities of school leadership—the social, cultural, relational, ethical and moral context of school leadership—can be taught effectively through the reflective processes of on-line <b>case</b> <b>narratives.</b> We seek to contribute to the ongoing dialogue on the potential of new pedagogies and new technologies to help prepare the competent and responsible leaders for tomorrow's schools...|$|R
40|$|This {{instructional}} case {{is designed}} to develop students ’ understanding of target costing, cost reduction methods, and associated strategic considerations. The <b>case</b> <b>narrative</b> describes a new product offering along with key market, product design, and cost data used to establish the market price, profit objectives, and target cost for the new product. The <b>case</b> <b>narrative</b> also relates a problematic target costing scenario in which a management team discovers they cannot meet the board-approved target cost for the new product due to errors in initial cost calculations and must identify {{a solution to the}} problem given strategic, logistic, and target objective pressures. Case requirements ask students to analyze the company’s competitive strategy/advantage, analyze the target costing model, explain determination/implications of cost estimates, consider proposed solutions, explain cost reduction methods, and evaluate ethical considerations in light of the concerns described in the narrative. Successful completion of the case requires understanding, synthesis, and application of strategic positioning, value chain analysis, customer value analysis, life-cycle cost management, and business ethics concepts...|$|E
40|$|This paper, a phenomenological case study, {{describes}} the psychotherapy of Langu (pseudonym), a 21 -year-old student, who presented with Acute Stress Disorder following {{a series of}} motor accidents that affected him and his family. Langu's most distressing experience was having to identify his brother's mutilated and severely burned body. Because of {{the intensity of the}} intrusive re-experiencing of traumatic imagery and the degree of dissociative numbing, Langu participated in four intensive guided imagery sessions, which involved reliving the incident, and imaginal dialogues with his dead brother. Session records and supervision notes from the therapy process that unfolded over 22 sessions served as the basis for a thematically selective <b>case</b> <b>narrative.</b> Additional material was obtained from several research interviews with Langu over the following months. The narrative highlights the impact of the imagery work as well as relational aspects of the therapy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if applying change analysis to the narrative reports made by reviewers of hospital deaths increases {{the utility of}} this information in the systematic analysis of patient harm. DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of causes and contributory factors underlying patient harm in 52 <b>case</b> <b>narratives</b> linked to preventable deaths derived from a retrospective case record review of 1000 deaths in acute National Health Service Trusts in 2009. PARTICIPANTS: 52 preventable hospital deaths. SETTING: England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The nature of problems in care and contributory factors underlying avoidable deaths in hospital. RESULTS: The change analysis approach enabled explicit characterisation of multiple problems in care, both across the admission and also at the boundary between primary and secondary care, and illuminated how these problems accumulate to cause harm. It demonstrated links between problems and underlying contributory factors and highlighted other threats to quality of care such as standards of end of life management. The method was straightforward to apply to multiple records and achieved good inter-rater reliability. CONCLUSION: Analysis of <b>case</b> <b>narratives</b> using change analysis provided a richer picture of healthcare-related harm than the traditional approach, unpacking {{the nature of the}} problems, particularly by delineating omissions from acts of commission, thus facilitating more tailored responses to patient harm...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} example of a case study written for {{instructional}} purposes, in order to support the achievement of specific learning outcomes which include (i) identifying modes of failure and (ii) selecting appropriate soil parameter types and values. Case writing was based primarily on information from a detailed publicly available article, supplemented with additional input from one author of this article. The <b>case</b> <b>narrative</b> is accompanied by annotated calculations, which follow the general design philosophy of the project. The case focuses on two of the main issues for the geotechnical design of the highway embankments close to the Limerick Tunnel, which are founded on very soft organic fine grained material. First, secondary compression, which is sizeable for this highway project, required surcharging to reduce the rate of long-term settlement. Second, the low undrained shear strength and high compressibility of the foundation material required construction of the embankments in stages, to achieve a degree of consolidation necessary for increased vertical effective stress, increased shear strength and reduced compressibility. This paper includes the <b>case</b> <b>narrative,</b> excerpts from the accompanying calculations, and comments on the instructional decisions involved in the preparation of both...|$|E

40|$|The {{approach}} of vocational Bildung didactics (VBD) {{has been developed}} to investigate practical knowledge in matters of education for Bildung and phronesis (practical wisdom). <b>Case</b> <b>narratives</b> of unusual richness or success are {{at the core of}} the approach, each case representing an articulation of someone’s practical knowledge. The concept of a practice as developed by MacIntyre is introduced here as a way of situating the practical knowledge of Bildung and phronesis gained from <b>case</b> <b>narratives.</b> A series of case studies are discussed in order to examine the practices thus surfaced. The result is a differentiation of MacIntyre’s concept in two directions: one more specific called vocational practice and one more general called a cultural practice. This differentiation is then applied to the case studies and it is argued that it helps illuminate aspects of them that previously were difficult to comprehend within the framework of VBD. The conclusion is that biographical cases where cultural and vocational practices intersect are uniquely positioned to afford knowledge of how such intersections have been achieved through education and what they have meant for the person initiated into such matrixes. This, in turn, contributes to the insight with which we are able to design vocational education and training (VET) curricula that support initiation into dynamic vocational practices with a focus on the internal goods and virtues possible to develop through them...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{interdisciplinary}} {{analysis is}} based on an authentic coaching case. It permits a ‘binocular’ view of the company's organizational structures and the psychosocial structures of individual employees. Selected metaphors used by the management consultant in a <b>case</b> <b>narrative</b> are interpreted first from a psychoanalytical and then from an organizational point of view. Thus, the psychological reality of the client is mapped onto the culture of the multinational corporation. The psychoanalytical interpretation points out a dynamic of an affective “open versus closed”, “revealing versus concealing” in the coaching relationship. On this microscopic level a number of different shame affects can be distinguished. The organizational study of the referential multinational company‘s corporate culture makes correlating shame affects and feelings among employees on a macroscopic level highly likely...|$|E

40|$|This study {{discusses}} the assessment {{and treatment of}} a 21 -year old male who had suffered multiple traumas, which had culminated {{in the death of}} his younger brother. He presented with Acute Stress Disorder. The literature review examines a diverse range of theorists and discourses, that have addressed the psychological consequences of trauma and highlights the complexity of the phenomena involved. The case study, located in the South African context, aims to sensitise the reader to the unique dilemmas facing each trauma survivor, and serves to highlight specifically those areas, which are pertinent and further more contribute significantly to the recovery process. The <b>case</b> <b>narrative</b> consists of a detailed synopsis of the therapy process, extracted from the session record notes documented at the time. Several other sources of information, including contributions from the participant, were used to verify and validate the accuracy of the data included. The narrative is written in a style that conveys the intensity of the nature of trauma work {{and the manner in which}} both patient and clinician are frequently confronted with very difficult emotional work. Finally the discussion examines the <b>case</b> <b>narrative</b> through the use of a set of carefully selected hermeneutic questions. These focused on (I) key concepts from the work of Robert Lifton who highlights the existential dimensions of the impact of trauma; (2) the role of the image in encapsulating the complex traumatic and post-traumatic experience of the survivor as well as facilitating the emotional processing of the trauma is examined; (3) the contribution to the process of therapy of aspects of the therapeutic relationship; and (4) the concept of recovery in relation to the question of what constitutes 'trauma work'. In conclusion, several meta-theoretical issues related to trauma, the strengths and weaknesses inherent to the research and relevant future areas of research are highlighted. ...|$|E
