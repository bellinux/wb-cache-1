5|$|On 13 December 2000, BBC Radio 3 {{broadcast}} a new adaptation directed by Howard Davies starring Geraldine McEwan as Lady Bracknell, Simon Russell Beale as Jack Worthing, Julian Wadham as Algernon Moncrieff, Geoffrey Palmer as Canon <b>Chasuble,</b> Celia Imrie as Miss Prism, Victoria Hamilton as Gwendolen and Emma Fielding as Cecily, with music composed by Dominic Muldowney. The production {{was released on}} audio cassette.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 the Roundabout Theatre Company {{produced}} a Broadway revival {{based on the}} 2009 Stratford Shakespeare Festival production featuring Brian Bedford as director and as Lady Bracknell. It opened at the American Airlines Theatre on 13 January and ran until 3 July 2011. The cast also included Dana Ivey as Miss Prism, Paxton Whitehead as Canon <b>Chasuble,</b> Santino Fontana as Algernon, Paul O'Brien as Lane, Charlotte Parry as Cecily, David Furr as Jack and Sara Topham as Gwendolen. It was nominated for three Tony Awards.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Parker, an English {{director}} {{who had previously}} adapted An Ideal Husband by Wilde, made the 2002 film; it stars Colin Firth (Jack), Rupert Everett (Algy), Judi Dench (Lady Bracknell), Reese Witherspoon (Cecily), Frances O'Connor (Gwendolen), Anna Massey (Miss Prism), and Tom Wilkinson (Canon <b>Chasuble).</b> Parker's adaptation includes the dunning solicitor Mr. Gribsby who pursues Jack to Hertfordshire (present in Wilde's original draft, but cut {{at the behest of}} the play's first producer). Algernon too is pursued by a group of creditors in the opening scene.|$|E
50|$|The {{bottom floor}} is mostly {{historic}} parament and liturgical equipment: two <b>chasubles</b> from the 14th century, late Gothic costumes with Italian silk, velvet and gold brocade, and gold brocade <b>chasubles</b> donated by Maria Theresa (her son Maximilian Francis was Prince-Bishop of Münster from 1784 until 1801).|$|R
5000|$|Use of {{scapular}} [...] "Roman" [...] <b>chasubles,</b> whether {{with straight}} edges or in [...] "fiddleback" [...] form, is sometimes associated with traditionalism. However, some priests prefer them simply {{on grounds of}} taste and comfort, while for similar reasons some traditionalist priests prefer ampler <b>chasubles</b> of less stiff material.|$|R
50|$|Pope Benedict XVI {{sometimes}} used <b>chasubles</b> of the transitional style common {{at the end}} of the 16th century.|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} many radio {{versions}} of the play. In 1925 the BBC broadcast an adaptation with Hesketh Pearson as Jack Worthing. Further broadcasts of the play followed in 1927 and 1936. In 1977, BBC Radio 4 broadcast the four-act version of the play, with Fabia Drake as Lady Bracknell, Richard Pasco as Jack, Jeremy Clyde as Algy, Maurice Denham as Canon <b>Chasuble,</b> Sylvia Coleridge as Miss Prism, Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Gwendolen and Prunella Scales as Cecily. The production was later released on CD.|$|E
5|$|To {{commemorate the}} centenary {{of the first}} {{performance}} of the play, Radio 4 broadcast a new adaptation on 13 February 1995; directed by Glyn Dearman, it featured Judi Dench as Lady Bracknell, Michael Hordern as Lane, Michael Sheen as Jack Worthing, Martin Clunes as Algernon Moncrieff, John Moffatt as Canon <b>Chasuble,</b> Miriam Margolyes as Miss Prism, Samantha Bond as Gwendolen and Amanda Root as Cecily. The production was later issued on audio cassette.|$|E
25|$|The Islamic silk <b>chasuble,</b> {{with the}} main fabric {{probably}} made in Al-Andaluz, that Edmund had with him at his death remains in a local church, with a stole and maniple.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{dissertation}} is {{to cover}} brief history of Karlstejn till the 16 th century {{as well as the}} historical evolution of the castle as such, further detail description and technological analyses of <b>chasubles,</b> their iconography and comparison with relative subjects in European context. Original form of <b>chasubles</b> prior to their restauration in 70 s of the last century will be described according to the technological analysis, literature and photos from NPU archive...|$|R
50|$|Items {{observed}} included: church bells, missals, books, monstrance, chalices, cruets, crosses, candlesticks, lamps, dresses, votives, <b>chasubles,</b> covers, albs, surplices and belts.|$|R
5000|$|Velvet {{was another}} laudable fabric that became {{widespread}} from the East to the West and {{was known as}} the finest and most expensive material on the international market. Velvet was worn by the elite in ceremonial garments such as <b>chasubles,</b> and were used as linings for relics.|$|R
25|$|Three years later, the {{instruction}} Tres abhinc annos of 4 May 1967 gave permission {{for use of}} the vernacular even in the Canon of the Mass, and allowed it to be said audibly and even, in part, to be chanted; the vernacular could be used even at Mass celebrated without the people being present. Use of the maniple was made optional, and at three ceremonies at which the cope was previously the obligatory vestment the <b>chasuble</b> could be used instead.|$|E
25|$|Among the paleo-orthodox and {{emerging}} church movements in Protestant and evangelical churches, {{in which some}} Presbyterians are involved, clergy are {{moving away from the}} traditional black Geneva gown to such vestments as the alb and <b>chasuble,</b> but also cassock and surplice (typically a full length Old English style surplice which resembles the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite), which some, particularly those identifying with the Liturgical Renewal Movement, hold to be more ancient and representative of a more ecumenical past.|$|E
25|$|The altarpiece {{is in the}} 1650-century Baroque {{style and}} was painted and carved by {{anonymous}} artists. The painting shows the crucifixion, while the carved angels on the frame exhibit the passion-cycle implements: nails and a thorny crown. At {{the bottom of the}} altarpiece, under the image, are carved the coat of arms for Bjelkes, Juuls and Lindenows. A chalice and a silver altar dish from 1655 are preserved at Austrått. A <b>chasuble</b> from 1662 is preserved in the church's collection. The carved pulpit is from the early 17th century.|$|E
60|$|I {{have known}} him indulge in profane, ungentlemanly emphatics, When the Protestant Church has been divided {{on the subject of}} the proper width of a <b>chasuble's</b> hem; I have even known him to sneer at albs--and as for dalmatics, Words can't convey an idea of the {{contempt}} he expressed for THEM.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{surviving}} examples of Opus Anglicanum were designed for liturgical use. These exquisite and expensive embroidery pieces were often made as vestments, such as copes, <b>chasubles</b> and orphreys, or else as antependia, shrine covers or other church furnishings. Secular examples, now known mostly just from contemporary inventories, included various types of garments, horse-trappings, book covers and decorative hangings.|$|R
50|$|The Free Church of England is a {{conventional}} Anglican church body, worshipping in the Low Church tradition and holding {{to the principles}} of the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles. Presbyters and deacons wear surplice, scarf and hood; bishops wear rochet and chimere, though a wider range of liturgical vesture is coming into use. Pictures on their website show use of albs, <b>chasubles,</b> and stoles.|$|R
25|$|The cope, therefore, {{is often}} worn at Anglo-Catholic churches where the celebrant at the Eucharist would {{conventionally}} wear the <b>chasuble.</b> In general those clergy who robe wear a cassock, surplice, scarf and, occasionally, also an academic hood. Since about 1990 there {{has sometimes been}} a practice of wearing a long surplice without a cassock, particularly through the summer. Most clergy in the diocese, however, dispense even with these robes, conducting church services in street clothes ranging from {{a suit and tie}} or clerical collar, to smart casual attire.|$|E
25|$|John Paul II's {{body was}} clothed in the {{familiar}} white soutane, over which was placed a plain white alb. A stole, the symbol of ordained ministry, was placed around his neck. Over the inner vestments, John Paul II was clothed in a red <b>chasuble.</b> An ancient Byzantine custom, red is the colour of mourning for Popes. Around his collar, the pallium of white lamb's wool was draped. A white zucchetto and a white bishop's mitre adorned John Paul II's head. In his arm rested Paul VI's pastoral cross-staff, used by popes {{in place of the}} crozier. His hands clasped a rosary. At first, he lay in state in his favourite pair of Polish-made brown leather shoes, size 44-1/2, which he wore on his travels throughout the world. Later, following the example of his immediate predecessors, these were changed to plain red leather papal shoes.|$|E
25|$|Like many medieval {{works of}} art, the Madonna {{displays}} {{a very complex}} iconography. The statue shows the Virgin in a rather plain gown, while the oversized Christ child figure in her lap wears a precious pontifical gown. The size is meant to illustrate the importance of Christ as redeemer. In contrast Mary is depicted in a serving role, in accordance with Luke 1:38: And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. At {{the same time she}} embodies the Seat of Wisdom as the Throne of Solomon is described in 1 Kings 10:18: Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. Sitting on her lap is the Christ child, whose ornate <b>chasuble</b> betokens his significance as ruler of the heavens, the book his role as herald of the faith. Bearing in mind other medieval portrayals of Christ as teacher, it may be supposed that the child’s lost right arm was originally raised in a gesture of blessing. However, Christ’s face is turned towards his mother, while from any position Mary’s look seems directed towards the beholder. Thus Mary may arguably not only be interpreted as a passive devotee but also assumes the role of mediator between the people and the Redeemer.|$|E
5000|$|The cathedral also {{includes}} a chapel of the Blessed Virgin in which visitors can read the testament of Louis XVI engraved on a black marble wall three meters high. Another peculiarity is that a there is a treasure house and within there are ornaments, <b>chasubles</b> and old bishops' sticks ... This was also where Saint Vincent de Paul was ordained as a deacon in 1598.|$|R
50|$|Matisse {{designed}} the priests' vestments for the chapel, using the traditional ecclesiastical {{colors of the}} religious seasons: purple, black, pink/rose, green, and red. The Pope requested that the nuns send the vestments to Rome {{to be put in}} the Vatican's new museum of modern religious art. The nuns made copies of five of the sets of vestments, including <b>chasubles,</b> maniples, stoles, and coverings of the chalice, and sent them to Rome.|$|R
50|$|Matthew was {{a witness}} to {{charters}} of kings Robert II and Robert III, an occasional ambassador of the Scottish crown to England, and a frequent arbiter in disputes concerning various religious establishments. On 21 May 1401, he introduced a tax in his diocese to improve the deficient ornamenta of the diocese (i.e. <b>chasubles,</b> copes, dalmatics, etc.). According to the Martyrology of Glasgow, he died on 10 May 1408.|$|R
500|$|Apart from {{multiple}} [...] "made-for-television" [...] versions, The Importance of Being Earnest has been adapted for the English-language cinema {{at least three}} times, first in 1952 by Anthony Asquith who adapted the screenplay and directed it. Michael Denison (Algernon), Michael Redgrave (Jack), Edith Evans (Lady Bracknell), Dorothy Tutin (Cecily), Joan Greenwood (Gwendolen), and Margaret Rutherford (Miss Prism) and Miles Malleson (Canon <b>Chasuble)</b> were among the cast. In 1992 Kurt Baker directed a version using an all-black cast with Daryl Keith Roach as Jack, Wren T. Brown as Algernon, Ann Weldon as Lady Bracknell, Lanei Chapman as Cecily, Chris Calloway as Gwendolen, CCH Pounder as Miss Prism, and Brock Peters as Doctor <b>Chasuble,</b> set in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Cecily is {{studying}} with her governess, Miss Prism. Algernon arrives, {{pretending to be}} Ernest Worthing, and soon charms Cecily. Long fascinated by Uncle Jack's hitherto absent black sheep brother, she is predisposed to fall for Algernon in his role of Ernest (a name she is apparently particularly fond of). Therefore, Algernon, too, plans for the rector, Dr. <b>Chasuble,</b> to rechristen him [...] "Ernest".|$|E
500|$|The setting {{represents}} the Mass– the angels are clothed in Eucharistic vestments, with {{those on the}} far right dressed in a deacon's cope. None wear the celebrant's <b>chasuble,</b> suggesting Christ is the priest. The shed roof is a ciborium over an altar. A later addition to the painting, added perhaps in the 17th century, and since removed, was a gold paten on which the infant lay, clearly showing Jesus as the Eucharistic host. Mary, Joseph and the angels are the first to worship the infant Christ and the shed [...] "becomes the altar of the first mass". Upton explains that when viewed {{in the context of the}} first mass the iconography is more clearly defined.|$|E
50|$|Historically, Italy {{has had a}} long {{tradition}} of bright and colourful embroidery. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries monastic embroideries developed a simpler style where designs and motifs were voided on fine linen cloth with the outlines and background embroidered in coloured silk. Motifs were strongly influenced by traditional designs of bird or animal pairs surrounded by elaborate scrollwork. These early articles were most often used for religious purposes, e.g., altar cloths and <b>chasubles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Baroque {{church was}} built on a plan of {{the sign of the}} Latin cross. The facade of the church is two storied. Inside the church there are many {{valuable}} elements: main altar (Baroque) of St. Anthony of Padua, chapel of blessed Raphael Chyliński with his coffin, side altars (renovated), Baroque wooden ambo with St. Francis of Assisi painting, etc. Also, there are some valuable paintings and <b>chasubles</b> in the sacristy of the church.|$|R
50|$|The {{treasury}} houses many masterpieces {{of medieval}} goldsmith's works. The western European masters’ hands are praised by {{such items as}} the crown silver cross {{that has been used}} since the 13th century, the ornate chalices, Francesco Francia’s processional cross, {{the upper part of the}} well-known ‘Matthias-Calvary’ which is decorated in the rare ronde-bosse enamel technique. The Treasury also has a vast collection of traditional Hungarian and European textiles, including <b>chasubles,</b> liturgical vestments and robes.|$|R
500|$|Though Wilde {{deployed}} {{characters that}} were by now familiar—the dandy lord, the overbearing matriarch, {{the woman with}} a past, the puritan young lady—his treatment is subtler than in his earlier comedies. Lady Bracknell, for instance, embodies respectable, upper-class society, but Eltis notes how her development [...] "from the familiar overbearing duchess into a quirkier and more disturbing character" [...] can be traced through Wilde's revisions of the play. For the two young men, Wilde presents not stereotypical stage [...] "dudes" [...] but intelligent beings who, as Jackson puts it, [...] "speak like their creator in well-formed complete sentences and rarely use slang or vogue-words". Dr <b>Chasuble</b> and Miss Prism are characterised by a few light touches of detail, their old-fashioned enthusiasms, and the Canon's fastidious pedantry, pared down by Wilde during his many redrafts of the text.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the changes}} to the {{calendar}} that had accompanied the Reformation remained in place during the subsequent centuries. [...] In Saxony in the eighteenth century, in addition to chief festivals of Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, a number of festivals were also celebrated with Vespers and Holy Communion, including Saint Stephen, Saint John, the Circumcision, Epiphany, Purification of Mary, the Annunciation, the Ascension, Holy Trinity, Nativity of Saint John the Baptist, the Visitation (on July 2), and Saint Michael (on September 29). [...] When Holy Communion was celebrated, a <b>chasuble</b> {{was used in the}} color of the day, though especially at Lepzig, these colors were different from the ones normally used today. [...] In the twentieth century, Lutherans in Europe came {{under the influence of the}} Liturgical Movement and many Lutheran churches adopted new calendars and rubrics similar to the Roman Calendar as revised by Vatican II. [...] The Swedish Church also experienced a similar reform of its liturgy and calendar during this same period.|$|E
500|$|The {{documentary}} evidence is rather richer than the physical remains. [...] Part {{of the reason}} for both these facts is the taste among the late Anglo-Saxon elite for embroidering using lavish amounts of precious metal thread, especially gold, which both gave items a magnificence and expense worth recording, and meant that they were well worth burning to recover the bullion. [...] Three old vestments, almost certainly Anglo-Saxon, recycled in this way at Canterbury Cathedral in the 1370s, produced over £250 of gold – a huge amount. [...] Richly embroidered hangings were used in both churches and the houses of the rich, but vestments were the most richly embellished of all, of a [...] "particularly English" [...] richness. [...] Most of these were sent back to Normandy or burnt for their metal after the Norman conquest. [...] An image of part of a huge gold acanthus flower {{on the back of a}} gold-bordered <b>chasuble,</b> almost certainly depicting a specific real vestment, can be seen in the Benedictional of St. Æthelwold (fol. 118v).|$|E
50|$|This {{relatively}} stable era ended after on 26 December 1499 the Wursten Frisians had defeated the Great or Black Guard in , hired by Hadeln's Regent Magnus, the heir apparent of Saxe-Lauenburg to subject them. On New Year's Day 1500, the surviving mercenaries — trekking on towards Saxe-Lauenburgian Hadeln — ravaged and plundered the nunnery, before burning it to ashes. Choirbooks, documents, partially self-woven tapestries, <b>chasubles</b> and paraments {{were lost in}} the fire.|$|R
25|$|In 1948, Matisse {{began to}} prepare {{designs for the}} Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence, which allowed him to expand this {{technique}} within a truly decorative context. The experience of designing the chapel windows, <b>chasubles,</b> and tabernacle door—all planned using the cut-out method—had the effect of consolidating the medium as his primary focus. Finishing his last painting in 1951 (and final sculpture the year before), Matisse utilized the paper cut-out as his sole medium for expression up until his death.|$|R
2500|$|High Church, {{especially}} {{the very high}} Anglo-Catholic movement, is ritually inclined towards the use of incense, formal hymns, and {{a higher degree of}} ceremony. In addition to clergy vesting in albs, stoles and <b>chasubles,</b> the lay assistants may also be vested in cassock and surplice. The sung Eucharist tends to be emphasized in High Church congregations, with Anglo-Catholic congregations and celebrants using sung services almost exclusively. Marian devotion is sometimes seen in the Anglo-Catholic and some High Church parishes.|$|R
