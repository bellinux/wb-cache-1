50|$|A <b>combination</b> <b>reamer</b> has {{two or more}} cutting surfaces. The <b>combination</b> <b>reamer</b> is {{precision}} ground into a pattern that resembles the part’s multiple internal diameters. The advantage of using a <b>combination</b> <b>reamer</b> {{is to reduce the}} number of turret operations, while more precisely holding depths, internal diameters and concentricity. Combination reamers are mostly used in screw machines or second-operation lathes, not with Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines because G-code can be easily generated to profile internal diameters.|$|E

50|$|Combination reamers can be {{made out}} of cobalt, carbide, or high speed steel tooling. When using {{combination}} reamers to ream large internal diameters made out of material with lower surface feet per minute, carbide tips can be brazed onto a configured drill blank to build the reamer. Carbide requires additional care because it is very brittle and will chip if chatter occurs. It is common to use a drill bit or combination drill to remove the bulk of material to reduce wear, or {{the risk of the}} part pulling off on the <b>combination</b> <b>reamer.</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the time required}} to remove endodontic posts made of quartz and glass fibers, and compare them to a new glass fiber post designed for easy removal on the basis of efficiency and tooth damages. Methods: 40 human single-rooted teeth were treated endodontically and randomly assigned to four fiber posts groups: 1) was restored with Premier# 90 (Innotech); 2) with DT# 2 Lightpost (Dentsply); 3) with Unicore# 3 (Ultradent); 4) with a special, soft-cored “S” glass fiber post ER-Prosthetic# 3 (Overfibers). An impression of the canal was taken prior post cementation. The posts were luted with Panavia F and adhesive (Kuraray). All the specimens were mounted in a dental simulation unit to reproduce the difficulty of clinical conditions. The fiber posts were removed using a diamond bur /Gates and Largo <b>reamer</b> <b>combination.</b> The teeth were examined radiographycally 2 times seeking for cement, fiber composite debris and tooth damage. After post removal, another impression of the canal was taken for each tooth to {{evaluate the}} canal enlargement. Then, the specimens were fractured and observed microscopically. Results: No significant differences were found among the conventional posts (groups 1 - 3) as regards removal time and dental tissue loss (Kruskal-Wallis, alpha= 0. 05). The new soft-core concept applied to the ER-Prosthetics allowed a mean rank removal time significantly lower (P= 0. 001) than the mean rank of group 1 - 3 posts (Dunn's test). The canal enlargement was significantly lower with ER posts. Root perforation occurred in groups 1 to 3, but none was recorded in group 4. Conclusion: Removal of posts avoiding dental tissue loss is a difficult task when performed in simulated clinical conditions. A new post type conceived to be removed safely in a short time was very effective to reduce the removal time without tooth damages. Further studies will be necessary to validate this new concept...|$|R
