5|$|Ignosticism is {{the view}} that a <b>coherent</b> {{definition}} of a deity must be put forward before {{the question of the}} existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed. If the chosen definition is not <b>coherent,</b> the ignostic holds the noncognitivist view that the existence of a deity is meaningless or empirically untestable.|$|E
5|$|As the {{microscopic}} world was expanding, the macroscopic world was shrinking. Botanists such as John Ray worked {{to incorporate the}} flood of newly discovered organisms shipped from across the globe into a <b>coherent</b> taxonomy, and a <b>coherent</b> theology (natural theology). Debate over another flood, the Noachian, catalyzed the development of paleontology; in 1669 Nicholas Steno published an essay on how the remains of living organisms could be trapped in layers of sediment and mineralized to produce fossils. Although Steno's ideas about fossilization were well known and much debated among natural philosophers, an organic origin for all fossils would not be accepted by all naturalists {{until the end of}} the 18th century due to philosophical and theological debate about issues such as the age of the earth and extinction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Coherent</b> {{units are}} derived units that contain no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions. In the example above, one newton is the force required to accelerate {{a mass of}} one kilogram by one metre per second squared. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2. Since the newton {{is part of a}} <b>coherent</b> set of units, the constant of proportionality is 1.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} between the Mauryan and the Gupta eras (c. 200 BCE–500 CE) {{philosophical}} schools of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism were taking form and a <b>coherent</b> philosophical system of yoga began to emerge.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a <b>coherent</b> system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only <b>coherent</b> systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being <b>coherent</b> with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E
5|$|Other particles, such as {{electrons}} and neutrons, {{may be used}} to produce a diffraction pattern. Although electron, neutron, and X-ray scattering are based on different physical processes, the resulting diffraction patterns are analyzed using the same <b>coherent</b> diffraction imaging techniques.|$|E
5|$|The {{metric system}} was first {{implemented}} during the French Revolution (1790s) {{with just the}} metre and kilogram as standards of length and mass respectively. In the 1830s Carl Friedrich Gauss laid the foundations for a <b>coherent</b> system based on length, mass, and time. In the 1860s a group working {{under the auspices of}} the British Association for the Advancement of Science formulated the requirement for a <b>coherent</b> system of units with base units and derived units. The inclusion of electrical units into the system was hampered by the customary use of more than one set of units, until 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi identified the need to define one single electrical quantity as a fourth base quantity alongside the original three base quantities.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the MSE is to obtain a {{comprehensive}} cross-sectional description of the patient's mental state, which, when combined with the biographical and historical information of the psychiatric history, allows the clinician to make an accurate diagnosis and formulation, which are required for <b>coherent</b> treatment planning.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{established}} in 2006 when Alberta Transportation renumbered portions of Highways637, 45, 860, 36, and 28 between Highways 36 and 41, forming a more <b>coherent</b> route between St.Paul and Edmonton that involved only two numbered highways.|$|E
25|$|According to Gilmore and Perelomov, {{who showed}} it independently, the {{construction}} of <b>coherent</b> states {{may be seen as}} a problem in group theory, and thus <b>coherent</b> states may be associated to groups different from the Heisenberg group, which leads to the canonical <b>coherent</b> states discussed above. Moreover, these <b>coherent</b> states may be generalized to quantum groups. These topics, with references to original work, are discussed in detail in <b>Coherent</b> states in mathematical physics.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} <b>coherent</b> Germanic text preserved is the 4th century Gothic {{translation of}} the New Testament by Ulfilas. Early testimonies of West Germanic are in Old Frankish/Old Dutch (the 5th century Bergakker inscription), Old High German (scattered words and sentences 6th century and <b>coherent</b> texts 9th century), and Old English (oldest texts 650, <b>coherent</b> texts 10th century). North Germanic is only attested in scattered runic inscriptions, as Proto-Norse, until it evolves into Old Norse by about 800.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the aims}} of science is to find models that will account for as many {{observations}} as possible within a <b>coherent</b> framework. Together, Galileo's rethinking {{of the nature of}} motion and Keplerian cosmology represented a <b>coherent</b> framework that was capable of rivaling the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic framework.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the angelic tongues are <b>coherent,</b> intelligible to man. However, since Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice is itself related to sung praise at the Qumran community, there is a {{parallel}} with <b>coherent</b> angelic praise tongues in Testament of Job.|$|E

25|$|The SuperDARN radar project {{researches}} the high- and mid-latitudes using <b>coherent</b> backscatter {{of radio}} {{waves in the}} 8 to 20nbsp&MHz range. <b>Coherent</b> backscatter is similar to Bragg scattering in crystals and involves the constructive interference of scattering from ionospheric density irregularities.

25|$|<b>Coherent</b> {{techniques}} generate frequencies {{derived from}} a single, stable master oscillator. In most applications, a crystal oscillator is common, but other resonators and frequency sources can be used. Incoherent techniques derive frequencies from a set of several stable oscillators. The vast majority of synthesizers in commercial applications use <b>coherent</b> techniques due to simplicity and low cost.|$|E
25|$|Since all the {{constants}} {{in these}} relationships is unity, the units {{are said to}} be <b>coherent.</b> Two years later James Thomson, older brother of William Thomson introduced the term poundal as a <b>coherent</b> unit of force in the Foot–pound–second system (FPS) of measurement. The equivalent FPS unit of work was the foot-poundal.|$|E

25|$|In physics, {{specifically}} in quantum mechanics, a <b>coherent</b> {{state is the}} specific quantum state of the quantum harmonic oscillator, often described as a state which has dynamics most closely resembling the oscillatory behavior of a classical harmonic oscillator. It was the first example of quantum dynamics when Erwin Schrödinger derived it in 1926, while searching for solutions of the Schrödinger equation that satisfy the correspondence principle. The quantum harmonic oscillator and hence, the <b>coherent</b> states, arise in the quantum theory {{of a wide range}} of physical systems. For instance, a <b>coherent</b> state describes the oscillating motion of a particle confined in a quadratic potential well (for an early reference, see e.g.|$|E

25|$|During REM sleep, {{electrical}} connectivity {{among different}} parts of the brain manifests differently than during wakefulness. Frontal and posterior areas are less <b>coherent</b> in most frequencies, a fact which has been cited in relation to the chaotic experience of dreaming. However, the posterior areas are more <b>coherent</b> with each other; as are the right and left hemispheres of the brain, especially during lucid dreams.|$|E
