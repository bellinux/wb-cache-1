The mosaic floors were recreated by Italian craftsmen {{at a cost of}} $50 per square foot ($538.12 per square meter). A local firm was found that could reproduce the complicated process of sandblasting and hide glue application used to create the original feather chipped glass. This reproduced glass was used to restore the partitions and naturally lit corridors of Root's design. To recreate the doors and wood trim, Donnell purchased the firm that had created the original oak woodwork—and still used the same 19th century machinery. Perfect replicas of the original aluminum light fixtures were fabricated from early photographs and <b>carbon</b> <b>filament</b> light bulbs were obtained to recreate the original lighting effect. A single surviving aluminum staircase was discovered behind a wall, restored, and used as a model to rebuild the lobby stairways and metalwork. The wainscoting on the upper floors was restored with marble salvaged from the recently modernized, nearby 19 LaSalle and Manhattan Buildings. Marble was purchased from the same Italian quarry that supplied Root's original construction to restore the lobby walls and ceilings.|$|E

25|$|Various {{forms of}} {{incandescent}} light bulbs had numerous inventors; however, {{the most successful}} early bulbs were those that used a <b>carbon</b> <b>filament</b> sealed in a high vacuum. These were invented by Joseph Swan in 1878 in Britain and by Thomas Edison in 1879 in the US. Edison’s lamp was more successful than Swan’s because Edison used a thinner filament, giving it higher resistance and thus conducting much less current. Edison began commercial production of <b>carbon</b> <b>filament</b> bulbs in 1880. Swan's light began commercial production in 1881.|$|E
25|$|Early lightbulbs with <b>carbon</b> <b>filaments</b> {{also used}} <b>carbon</b> monoxide, nitrogen, or mercury vapor. <b>Carbon</b> <b>filaments</b> however operate at lower {{temperatures}} than tungsten ones, so {{the effect of}} the fill gas was not significant as the heat losses offset any benefits.|$|R

50|$|They {{have also}} {{investigated}} carbon as memory material, focusing in particular on oxygenated amorphous carbon {{to address the}} issue of low endurance due to the difficulty of breaking the conductive <b>carbon</b> <b>filaments.</b> In oxygenated amorphous carbon, oxygen is added as a dopant to facilitate the breaking of the <b>carbon</b> <b>filaments</b> because it is known that carbon-based materials, when exposed to oxygen, break down by so-called Joule heating.|$|R
25|$|In 1897, German {{physicist}} and chemist Walther Nernst developed the Nernst lamp, {{a form of}} incandescent lamp that used a ceramic globar and did not require enclosure in a vacuum or inert gas. Twice as efficient as <b>carbon</b> <b>filament</b> lamps, Nernst lamps were briefly popular until overtaken by lamps using metal filaments.|$|E
25|$|In 1850 Swan {{began working}} on a light bulb using {{carbonized}} paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860 {{he was able to}} demonstrate a working device, and obtained a British patent covering a partial vacuum, <b>carbon</b> <b>filament</b> incandescent lamp. However, the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate electric source resulted in an inefficient light bulb with a short lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Swan's {{carbon rod}} lamp and <b>carbon</b> <b>filament</b> lamp, while functional, were still {{relatively}} impractical due to low resistance (needing very expensive thick copper wiring) and short running life. While {{searching for a}} better filament for his light bulb, Swan inadvertently made another advance. In 1881 he developed and patented a process for squeezing nitro-cellulose through holes to form conducting fibres. His newly established company (which by merger eventually became the Edison and Swan United Company) used Swan's cellulose filaments in their bulbs. The textile industry has also used this process.|$|E
25|$|Consumption of {{incandescent}} light bulbs grew {{rapidly in the}} US. In 1885, an estimated 300,000 general lighting service lamps were sold, all with <b>carbon</b> <b>filaments.</b> When tungsten filaments were introduced, about 50 million lamp sockets existed in the US. In 1914, 88.5 million lamps were used, (only 15% with <b>carbon</b> <b>filaments),</b> and by 1945, annual sales of lamps were 795 million (more than 5 lamps per person per year).|$|R

Involves use of roller squeegee to ensure filaments continuously wet with resin during winding.

Lends itself to full automation and involves use of filaments and matrix-precursor resins in their simplest forms, thereby reducing costs...|$|R

25|$|The city {{is noted}} for one world record. A 110+ year old 4-watt light bulb, called the Centennial Light, {{housed in the}} Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department main station, is still burning.

The Guinness Book of World Records, Ripley's Believe It or Not, and General Electric {{have concluded that the}} bulb has been burning continuously since 1901 with the exception of power failures and three times it was disconnected for moves to new stations. The light bulb was manufactured by the Shelby Electric Company and was hand blown with a <b>carbon</b> <b>filament.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 13 December 1904, Hungarian Sándor Just and Croatian Franjo Hanaman {{were granted}} a Hungarian patent (No. 34541) for a {{tungsten}} filament lamp that lasted longer and gave brighter light than the <b>carbon</b> <b>filament.</b> Tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the Hungarian company Tungsram in 1904. This type {{is often called}} Tungsram-bulbs in many European countries. Filling a bulb with an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen retards the evaporation of the tungsten filament compared to operating it in a vacuum. This allows for greater temperatures and therefore greater efficacy with less reduction in filament life.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan {{developed}} a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880. On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown {{at a meeting of}} the Newcastle Chemical Society, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. This bulb lasted about 40 hours. Swan then turned his attention to producing a better <b>carbon</b> <b>filament</b> and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' in the early 1880s and obtained British Patent 4933 that same year. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house, Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity. The first street in the world to be lit by an incandescent lightbulb was Mosley Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. It was lit by Joseph Swan's incandescent lamp on 3 February 1879.|$|E

This was purposefully designed this way to circumvent the Edison patents. Many of these lamps were used by the Westinghouse Electric Company for lights at the World's Fair of Chicago in 1893.

2500|$|Although {{the patent}} {{described}} several ways {{of creating the}} <b>carbon</b> <b>filament</b> including [...] "cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways", {{it was not until}} several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered a carbonized bamboo filament that could last over 1,200hours. The idea of using this particular raw material originated from Edison's recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of Battle Lake in the present-day state of Wyoming, where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on July 29, 1878, from the Continental Divide.|$|E
