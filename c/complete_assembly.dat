5|$|The bitter {{rivalry between}} Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia flared up in 1919, when UGA mocked Tech's {{continuation}} of football during the United States' involvement in World War I. Because Tech {{was a military}} training ground, it had a <b>complete</b> <b>assembly</b> of male students. Many schools, such as UGA, lost all of their able-bodied male students to the war effort, forcing them to temporarily suspend football during the war. In fact, UGA did not play a game from 1917 to 1918.|$|E
25|$|Collins {{was laid}} down in February 1990. The two most complex {{sections}} of the first submarine were constructed by Kockums' shipyard in Malmö, Sweden, while the other four sections and <b>complete</b> <b>assembly</b> of the submarine occurred at Australian Submarine Corporation's facility in Port Adelaide, South Australia. It was originally planned to construct the first submarine completely overseas, {{but by the time}} the tender was awarded, it had been decided to build all six submarines in Australia; the increase in cost by not building the lead ship in the winning designer's home shipyard were believed to be offset by the additional experience provided to Australian industries.|$|E

25|$|There {{are more}} than 100 classes of RNA {{modifications}} that have been found, a majority {{of which are in}} tRNA and rRNA while only three modified nucleotides have been discovered inside a coding sequence of mRNA: m6A, 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and inosine. The relevance of pseudouridine in rRNA has been documented where pseudouridylation is required for ribosome biogenesis and translational accuracy. The importance of pseudouridylation additionally seen in snRNA where specific pseudouridine residues have been located and identified as a needed component of pre-mRNA splicing. Previous research has focused specifically at the modifications of U2 spliceosomal RNA which are required for snRNP assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. U2 in comparison to other spliceosomal snRNAs has the most extensive modifications, including 13 pseudouridines as well as a 5' trim ethyl guanosine (TMG) cap and others. It is a mixture of modifications involving that of the pseudouridine residues that assist in the <b>complete</b> <b>assembly</b> of the 17S U2 snRNP particle needed for splicing.|$|E
2500|$|Fuel {{was added}} to the fire in 1919, when UGA mocked Tech's {{continuation}} of football during the United States' involvement in World War I. At the time, Tech was a military training ground and had a <b>complete</b> <b>assembly</b> of male students. Many schools, such as UGA, had lost the vast majority of their able-bodied male students to the war effort, forcing them to temporarily suspend football during the war. As a result, UGA did not play a football game from 1917–18. When UGA renewed its program in 1919, the student body staged a parade, which mocked Tech's continuation of football during times of war. The parade featured a tank shaped float emblazoned with the words [...] "UGA IN ARGONNE" [...] followed by a yellow-clad donkey and a sign that read [...] "TECH IN ATLANTA." [...] This act led directly to Tech cutting athletic ties with UGA and canceling several of UGA's home football games at Grant Field (UGA commonly used Grant Field as its home field). Tech and UGA did not compete in athletics until the 1921 Southern Conference basketball tournament. Regular season competition was not renewed until a 1925 agreement between the two institutions.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 December 2013, Boeing {{joined the}} wings and {{fuselage}} for the first 767-2C to be adapted into a KC-46A. On 23 December 2013, the first two PW4062 engines were delivered. The first of four 767-2C provision freighters were to <b>complete</b> <b>assembly</b> {{by the end of}} January 2014. Once assembled, it would go through ground vibration and instrumentation testing and have body fuel tanks added. The first test flight would occur during summer 2014 and include measuring its rate of climb and descent. The Engineering Manufacturing and Design (EMD) model would be integrated with instrumentation, electronics, and technologies needed to become a military-standard KC-46A by January 2015. Seven low-rate production KC-46s are to be delivered in 2015, 12 in 2016, and 15 delivered annually from 2017 to 2027. The KC-46A can carry [...] of fuel, 10 percent more than the KC-135, and [...] of cargo. It has both a probe and drogue and a boom and receptacle to conduct multiple refueling missions on a single mission. Survivability is improved with infrared countermeasures and the aircraft has limited electronic warfare capabilities. The airframe can be configured to carry 114 passengers and to serve as an aero-medical evacuation aircraft. The last of four test aircraft began assembly on 16 January 2014.|$|E
