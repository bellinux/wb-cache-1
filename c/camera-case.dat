30|$|LIR {{developed}} for Akatsuki, the first Japanese Venus Climate Orbiter, the first lightweight infrared camera {{to use an}} uncooled micro-bolometer array as an image sensor. The infrared camera observes the thermal emission from the cloud top of Venus in the wavelength region 8 – 12 µm to obtain two-dimensional distributions of temperature and wind vector at the cloud top, where the temperature is typically as low as 230 K. The flight model of LIR has been manufactured and its performance was confirmed by several tests in a vacuum environment. It {{has been shown that}} the target performance of NETD∼ 0.3 K at an object temperature of ∼ 230 K is achieved by averaging several tens of images acquired within a few minutes. This NETD corresponds to a height difference at a cloud top of 100 m for an average temperature profile. The <b>camera-case</b> temperature should be stabilized within the temperature range of 293.5 – 304.6 K in order to take an image of an object having a temperature as low as 203 K. The tolerances of the bolometer array to sunlight, the mechanical environment, and high-energy protons, have been tested and satisfy the requirements. It is also confirmed that the shutter mechanism has enough endurance for the mission life of two years.|$|E
