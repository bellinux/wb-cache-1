40|$|International audienceBACKGROUNDThe {{development}} of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> that enable benchmarking between organizations {{is an important}} mechanism for accountability, organizational learning, and performance improvement. In the province of Quebec (Canada), 21 rehabilitation organizations developed a <b>common</b> set of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> through interorganizational collaboration. PURPOSEThe aims {{of this study were}} to describe the rehabilitation organizations' use of a <b>common</b> set of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> and to identify the factors influencing such use. APPROACHA qualitative survey was performed. Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with executives (n = 18) working at 16 rehabilitation organizations using a <b>common</b> set of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> A thematic analysis of the factors of use was performed according to the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. The use of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> was categorized as purposeful, political, or passive. FINDINGSOur results showed that all organizations used the <b>common</b> set of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> Four factors were identified as important to all the rehabilitation organizations to explain their interest in comparative performance indicators: the need to develop their own <b>performance</b> <b>indicators,</b> the compatibility of performance information with organizational needs, complexity/simplicity of performance information, and the support offered by their common association. Sixty-three percent of rehabilitation organizations made purposeful or political use of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators.</b> Three main factors contributed to typify those organizations from the others: the perceived quality of the <b>performance</b> <b>indicators,</b> the leadership of decision makers, and the resources available. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONSOur results showed that use of <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> can support the initiation of projects for improving the quality of care.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{consistent}} way of assessing {{the performance of}} second generation biofuel production using energy market scenarios.

40|$|Abstract: The state {{authorities}} in Germany used to fund public sector research without con-trolling {{the performance of}} the research units. This has changed during past decade, where the dominant mechanism by which formerly unconditional state funds are allocated nowadays is indicator-based <b>performance</b> measurement. The <b>indicator</b> sets used to measure the research-related performance in the German public science sector are usually very narrow, often con-sisting exclusively of finished doctoral theses and third-party funds. Using a unique dataset of 473 German research units from astrophysics, nanotechnology, economics and biotechnology, this paper outlines principles for the construction of sensible indicator sets for the perform-ance measurement of scientific research groups. It is argued that scientific production is mul-tidimensional. Thus one-sided indicator sets that fail to cover the relevant output dimensions give rise to incentives that will ultimately lower {{the performance of the}} science sector in total. Indicator sets should strive for sustainable incentives, which can be guaranteed if the sets are broad enough. As a starting point it is shown that the very <b>common</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicator</b> "acquired third-party funds " may affect research efficiency negatively, especially if the level of third-party funds is already very high. Therefore, we conclude that third-party funds should be used with great care, if at all...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to analyse}} and {{critique}} <b>common</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> for the policing of organised crime, and {{to propose a}} new approach. Design/methodology/approach - This paper was based on key respondent interviews with staff at an organised crime-policing agency; literature review; analytical work and {{construction of a new}} model. Findings - KPIs and other targets drive the policing of organised crime. Often these ultimately constitute numerical targets - amount of drugs seized; number of key nominals arrested, etc. - which are crude and which the research evidence base on the reduction or prevention of organised crime activity does not support as being suitable measures of success. Success in contemporary organised crime policing is increasingly becoming defined in terms of "harm reduction" (often at the "community level"). A new performance management framework for organised crime-policing agencies is proposed, which is more sensitive than traditional measures to harm reduction. The proposed model comprises three components: programme logic; a pathway approach; and the use of evaluation panels. Research limitations/implications - The empirical research was only conducted in one organised crime agency and therefore provides a case study approach to performance management. The literature review suggests that the performance management framework of that agency was similar to other comparable agencies around the world, but more comparative research would be needed to confirm that. The model proposed would benefit from piloting and evaluation. Practical implications - The analysis and modelling provided in this paper create the groundwork for the development of more effective performance indicators and targets in organised crime policing. Originality/value - This lies in the attempt to tie business model drivers into policing that is more sensitive to reducing the adverse social outcomes of organised crime than traditional drivers that tend to create formal, rather than substantive, police interventions...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, navigation-related {{forecasts}} {{in central}} Europe cover short- to medium-range lead times {{linked to the}} travel times of vessels to pass the main waterway bottlenecks leaving the loading ports. Without doubt, this aspect is still essential for navigational users, but {{in light of the}} growing political intention to use the free capacity of the inland waterway transport in Europe, additional lead time supporting strategic decisions is more and more in demand. However, no such predictions offering extended lead times of several weeks up to several months currently exist for considerable parts of the European waterway network. This paper describes the set-up of a monthly to seasonal forecasting system for the German stretches of the international waterways of the Rhine, Danube and Elbe rivers. Two competitive forecast approaches have been implemented: the dynamical set-up forces a hydrological model with post-processed outputs from ECMWF general circulation model System 4, whereas the statistical approach is based on the empirical relationship ("teleconnection") of global oceanic, climate and regional hydro-meteorological data with river flows. The performance of both forecast methods is evaluated in relation to the climatological forecast (ensemble of historical streamflow) and the well-known ensemble streamflow prediction approach (ESP, ensemble based on historical meteorology) using <b>common</b> <b>performance</b> <b>indicators</b> (correlation coefficient; mean absolute error, skill score; mean squared error, skill score; and continuous ranked probability, skill score) and an impact-based evaluation quantifying the potential economic gain. The following four key findings result from this study: (1) as former studies for other regions of central Europe indicate, the accuracy and/or skill of the meteorological forcing used has a larger effect than the quality of initial hydrological conditions for relevant stations along the German waterways. (2) Despite the predictive limitations on longer lead times in central Europe, this study reveals the existence of a valuable predictability of streamflow on monthly up to seasonal timescales along the Rhine, upper Danube and Elbe waterways, and the Elbe achieves the highest skill and economic value. (3) The more physically based and the statistical approach are able to improve the predictive skills and economic value compared to climatology and the ESP approach. The specific forecast skill highly depends on the forecast location, the lead time and the season. (4) Currently, the statistical approach seems to be most skilful for the three waterways investigated. The lagged relationship between the monthly and/or seasonal streamflow and the climatic and/or oceanic variables vary between 1 month (e. g. local precipitation, temperature and soil moisture) up to 6 months (e. g. sea surface temperature). Besides focusing on improving the forecast methodology, especially by combining the individual approaches, the focus is on developing useful forecast products on monthly to seasonal timescales for waterway transport and to operationalize the related forecasting service...|$|E
