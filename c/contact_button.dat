5000|$|It {{is thought}} that WSJM-FM {{was one of the}} world's first {{completely}} automated radio stations, built and designed by Brian Brown in 1963 when Brown was only 10 years old. The station broadcast in a classical format, called [...] "More Good Music (MGM)" [...] and five-minute bottom-of-the-hour news feeds from the Mutual Broadcasting System. The heart of the automation was an 8 x 24 telephone stepping relay which controlled two reel-to-reel tape decks, one twelve inch Ampex machine which provided the main program audio and a second RCA seven inch machine which provided [...] "fill" [...] music. The tapes that these machines played were originally produced in the MWF's Madison, Wisconsin production facility by WSJM Chief Engineer Richard E. McLemore (and later in-house at WSJM) with special sub-audible cue tones used to signal the end of a song. The stepping relay was [...] "programmed" [...] by slide switches {{in the front of the}} two relay racks which housed the equipment. The news feeds were triggered by a microswitch which was attached to a Western Union clock and tripped by the minute hand of the clock. and then reset the stepping relay. Originally, 20-minute station identification was accomplished by a simulcast switch in the control booth for sister station WSJM, whereupon the disc jockey in the booth would announce [...] "This is WSJM AM and... (then pressing the momentary <b>contact</b> <b>button)</b> ...WSJM-FM, St. Joseph, Michigan." [...] This only lasted about six months, however, and a standard tape cartridge player was wired in to announce the station identification and triggered by the Western Union clock.|$|E

40|$|When reaching, {{children}} with dystonia exhibit movements that are slower and more variable than normal children. We hypothesize that in dystonia {{there is an}} increase in signal-dependent noise so that there is increased variability with increas-ing speed. This hypothesis predicts that slower movement in {{children with}} dystonia is at least partly due to a compensatory strategy to reduce variability by decreasing speed. To test this hypothesis, we measured the speed of arm movement while children attempted to <b>contact</b> <b>buttons</b> of different sizes. We tested 23 control children and 15 {{children between the ages of}} 4 and 16 years with dystonia owing to either cerebral palsy, idiopathic dystonia not due to the DYT 1 (torsin A) muta-tion, or other identified causes. A consistent inverse relationship between movement time and button size was seen for both the control children and the children with dystonia. The variance of movement speed increased with the average speed for all subjects. Children with dystonia moved significantly more slowly at all button sizes, and their movement speed was more sensitive to changes in button size. Therefore, part of the reduction in speed in dystonia is due to rela-tively greater difficulty in contacting small targets. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis of increased signal-dependent noise in children with dystonia, and we present a simple computational model that provides a possible explanation for the origin of this noise.

50|$|Infrared light {{makes up}} the {{invisible}} section of the electromagnetic spectrum. This light, also classified as heat, transmits signals between the transmitter and receiver of the remote system. Telecommand systems usually include a physical remote, which contains four key parts: buttons, integrated circuit, <b>button</b> <b>contacts,</b> and a light-emitting diode. When the buttons on a remote are pressed they touch and close their corresponding contacts below them within the remote. This completes the necessary circuit on the circuit board along with a change in electrical resistance, which is detected by the integrated circuit. Based on the change in electrical resistance, the integrated circuit distinguishes which button was pushed and sends a corresponding binary code to the light-emitting diode (LED) usually located {{at the front of}} the remote. To transfer the information from the remote to the receiver, the LED turns the electrical signals into an invisible beam of infrared light that corresponds with the binary code and sends this light to the receiver. The receiver then detects the light signal via a photodiode and it is transformed into an electrical signal for the command and is sent to the receiver’s integrated circuit/microprocessor to process and complete the command. The strength of the transmitting LED can vary and determines the required positioning accuracy of the remote in relevance to the receiver. Infrared remotes have a maximum range of approximately 30 feet and require the remote control or transmitter and receiver to be within a line of sight.|$|R
40|$|A new 6 -degree {{of freedom}} {{dynamometer}} is presented. Six load cells measure the normal forces at the contact points of a three groove kinematic coupling. Three toggle clamps {{are used to}} preload the machine, {{so that it does}} not come apart. The device was designed, analyzed, built and tested. The error will mainly depend on frictional forces, load cells error and the toggle clamps. Frictional forces affect hysteresis, absorption and settlement of the coupling. Different solutions have been designed and tested to reduce friction. First, we tried direct contact between three stainless-steel rods and the stainless-steel load cells. The results were fully distorted due to the high friction of hard steel. We also tried three stainless-steels rods with flexures to <b>contact</b> the steel <b>button</b> cells. The results were much better and more repeatable, but absorption was not good enough. Finally, we tried using Teflon. Teflon is stuck to a steel plate that touches the contact points, leaving Teflon free of high stresses and allowing it to reduce friction between the contacts. The outcome was acceptable. In this case, hysteresis will be reasonably low, absorption is moderate and settlement-based problems are small for small preloads. Fortunately, settlement ability will be improved thanks to vibrations. Future investigations shall look towards low friction solutions, since the sturdiest and most user-friendly design will be the one that minimizes friction during the settlement process. by Jaime Moreu Gamazo.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{an optical}} sensor system, which is integrated into an industrial push-button. The sensor allows to classify {{the type of}} material that is in <b>contact</b> with the <b>button</b> when pressed into different material categories {{on the basis of}} the material's so called "spectral signature". An approach for a safety sensor system at circular table saws on the same base has been introduced previously on SIAS- 2007. This contactless working sensor is able to distinguish reliably between skin, textiles, leather and various other kinds of materials. A typical application for this intelligent push-button is the use at possibly dangerous machines, whose operating instructions include either the prohibition or the obligation to wear gloves during the work at the machine. An exemple of machines at which no gloves are allowed are pillar drilling machines, because of the risk of getting caught in the drill chuck and being turned in by the machine. In many cases this causes very serious hand injuries. Depending on the application needs, the sensor system integrated into the push-button can be configured flexibly by software to prevent the operator from accidentally starting a machine with or without gloves, which can decrease the risk of severe accidents significantly. Especially two-hand controls are incentive to manipulation for easier handling. By equipping both push-buttons of a two-hand control with material classification properties, the user is forced to operate the controls with his bare fingers. That limitation disallows the manipulation of a two-hand control by a simple rodding device...|$|R

It was reported by Red Bull on the following lap that eighth-placed Webber had no mechanical issues. Webber made an early pit stop on lap seven for the medium compound tyres but his crew had a minor problem fitting his left-front wheel which meant he was stationary for 7.9 seconds, and rejoined in 18th position.

The published article is copyrighted by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. and can be found at: [URL] sound broadcast systems have been used to address a variety of ecological questions, and show great potential as a management tool. Such systems need to be reliable because treatments are often applied {{in the absence of a}} human observer and system failure can cause methodological ambiguity. During the breeding seasons of 2012 and 2013, we used a sound broadcast system previously described by Farrell and Campomizzi (2011) in an experiment evaluating the use of post-breeding song in forest-bird habitat selection in southern Indiana, USA. This system incorporates a portable compact disc (CD) player where the play button is permanently depressed using manual compression so that when a timer connects an electrical current to the unit, the CD player automatically starts. Despite exhaustive efforts to find a reliable way to manually compress the play button on numerous CD player models, play button failure was the most significant source of broadcast system failure (88 %) in 2012. We attempted to resolve this problem in 2013 by removing the need for manual compression and soldering the play <b>button</b> <b>contact</b> poles on each CD players' integrated circuit boards. Though we did experience broadcast system failures during < 5 % of treatment periods in 2013, none of those were attributable to play button failure. By removing all possibility of failure from manual play button compression we improved our system reliability. Thus, soldering the CD player play button on such broadcast systems represents a methodological improvement that can be used by researchers and managers interested in sound broadcast...|$|R
50|$|McLaren secured fifth place. Following {{their first}} season without a podium finish in 2013, the team saw Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button finish {{second and third}} in Australia. Both drivers {{recorded}} points finishes in Malaysia, but were {{forced out of the}} Bahrain Grand Prix with clutch issues, and failed to score points in China and again in Spain. The team managed to recover in Monaco, with Button finishing sixth and Magnussen tenth after <b>contact</b> with Räikkönen. <b>Button</b> finished fourth in Canada after a string of late-race retirements helped him move up the order. Magnussen used his recent knowledge of the circuit to finish seventh in Austria, while Button's attempt at a different strategy failed, leaving him in eleventh. Button and Magnussen were fourth and seventh respectively in Britain. Button finished eighth in Germany, ahead of Magnussen, who was involved in a first-lap altercation with Massa. Button finished tenth in Hungary, while Magnussen was outside the points. In Belgium, Magnussen finished sixth ahead of Button, but was given a twenty-second time penalty after the race, demoting him to twelfth. In Italy, Magnussen and Button originally finished seventh and ninth respectively, but Magnussen received another time penalty—this time for five seconds—demoting him to tenth, while Button promoted to eighth. Magnussen took the final point in Singapore, while Button was forced out when his engine shut down. Button finished fifth in Japan, while Magnussen was outside the points. The team took fourth and fifth place in Russia, with Button finishing in front of Magnussen. Magnussen took eighth in the United States, while Button failed to score points. Button finished fourth in Brazil whilst Magnussen finished ninth. In Abu Dhabi, Button finished fifth, while Magnussen finished outside the points.|$|R
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap <b>contact</b> between Jenson <b>Button,</b> Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy graining, particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from bad to worse when an anti-roll bar on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop {{in order to make it}} to the finish, only to tear up a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he slid down to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|R
