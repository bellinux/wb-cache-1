5|$|The root {{structure}} of B.prionotes exhibits two common environmental adaptations. Firstly, this species is phreatophytic, that is, its long taproot extends {{down to the}} water table, securing it a <b>continuous</b> <b>water</b> supply through the dry summer months, when surface water is generally unavailable. This not only helps ensure survival over summer, but allows plants to grow then. Though the supply of water is the taproot's primary function, the ground water obtained typically contains ionic concentrations of chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium that are adequate for the plant's nutritional needs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background We {{previously}} {{developed a}} high-throughput system called 'Ice-Cap' for growing Arabidopsis seedlings in a 96 -well format and rapidly collecting tissue for subsequent DNA extraction and genotyping. While the originally described Ice-Cap method {{is an effective}} tool for high-throughput genotyping, one shortcoming of {{the first version of}} Ice-Cap is that optimal seedling growth is highly dependent on specific environmental conditions. Here we describe several technical improvements to the Ice-Cap method that make it much more robust and provide a detailed protocol for implementing the method. Results The key innovation underlying Ice-Cap 2. 0 is the development of a <b>continuous</b> <b>watering</b> system. The addition of the watering system allows the seedling growth plates to be incubated without a lid {{for the duration of the}} growth period, which in turn allows for much more uniform and robust seedling growth than was observed using the original method. We also determined that inserting wooden skewers between the upper and lower plates prior to tissue harvest made it easier to separate the plates following freezing. Seedlings grown using the Ice-Cap 2. 0 method remain viable in the Ice-Cap plates twice as long as seedlings grown using the original method. Conclusion The <b>continuous</b> <b>watering</b> system that we have developed provides an effective solution to the problem of sub-optimal seedling growth that can be encountered when using the originally described Ice-Cap system. This novel watering system and several additional modifications to the Ice-Cap procedure have improved the robustness and utility of the method. </p...|$|R

25|$|The Tibitoc water {{production}} plant, {{located in}} the suburbs of Bogota, supplies almost 30% of Bogota's residents. To ensure <b>continuous</b> <b>water</b> supply, a rehabilitation project of the water plant and water mains was carried out. This is a 20-year project that began in 1998. An investment of US$22 million over three years was made by Veolia Water Solutions & Technologies to rehabilitate the entire water treatment process including physical pretreatment, coagulation, flocculation, sand filtration, neutralization and disinfection. Additionally, there was an investment of US$35 million to rehabilitate the Tibitoc water production plant water main lines. Other improvements were made to operating guidelines and the monitoring of the facility.|$|E

25|$|Service {{quality is}} {{generally}} good with <b>continuous</b> <b>water</b> supply. In early 2008 private operators published {{for the first}} time consolidated performance indicators on service quality. It showed that 99.7% of samples complied with bacteriological standards for drinking water quality, but only 82.3% of samples complied with standards for the discharge of treated wastewater. The share of unplanned water service interruptions was less than 3%. The indicators do not include statistics on sewer overflows. A decree of May 2007 requires public service providers to provide the same information on service quality to the public that has been provided by private service providers, beginning in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Continued {{research}} has revealed some shortcomings and simplifications {{in the original}} theory. For instance, channel proteins are described as having a <b>continuous</b> <b>water</b> channel through their center, which is now known to be generally untrue (an exception being nuclear pore complexes, which have a 9nm open water channel). Also, free diffusion on the cell surface is often limited to areas a few tens of nanometers across. These limits to lateral fluidity are due to cytoskeleton anchors, lipid phase separation and aggregated protein structures. Contemporary studies also indicate that much less of the plasma membrane is “bare” lipid than previously thought and in fact much of the cell surface may be protein-associated. In spite of these limitations, the fluid mosaic model remains a popular and often referenced general notion for the structure of biological membranes.|$|E

25|$|According to {{a survey}} by the {{regulatory}} body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed <b>continuous</b> <b>water</b> supply. On average, customers received water 12 hours per day. Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. One of the reasons is that, because of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the cities}} of Hubli, Belgaum and Gulbarga {{in the state of}} Karnataka, the private {{operator}} Veolia increased water supply from once every 2–15days for 1–2hours, to 24hours per day for 180,000 people (12% {{of the population of the}} 3 cities) within 2years (2006–2008). This was achieved by carefully selecting and ring-fencing demonstration zones (one in each city), renovating the distribution network, installing meters, introducing a well-functioning commercial system, and effective grass-roots social intermediation by an NGO, all without increasing the amount of bulk water supplied. The project, known by its acronym as KUWASIP (Karnataka Urban Water Sector Improvement Project), was supported by a 39.5million loan from the World Bank. It constitutes a milestone for India, where no large city so far has achieved <b>continuous</b> <b>water</b> supply. The project is expected to be scaled-up to cover the entire area of the three cities.|$|E
25|$|Efficiency {{and service}} quality {{improved}} substantially {{over the following}} years. The level on non-revenue water decreased from an estimated 36% in 2005 to 10% in 2009; one quarter of residents received <b>continuous</b> <b>water</b> supply (although the average supply remained at only 7hours per day) in 2009; the share of metered connections increased from 2% in 2007 to 26% in 2009; the number of customers increased; and the company recovered its operating costs plus a portion of capital costs. Identifying and legalising illegal connections was {{an important element in}} the reduction of non-revenue water. The utility prides itself today of the good drinking water quality provided and encourages its customers to drink from the tap. The utility also operates a wastewater treatment plant that meets discharge standards. The private utility pays salaries that are higher than civil service salaries and conducts extensive training programs for its staff. It has also installed a modern system to track and resolve customer complaints. Furthermore, it conducts independent annual customer satisfaction surveys. JUSCO’s vision is to be the preferred provider of water supply and other urban services throughout India. Together with Ranhill Malaysia it won a 25-year concession contract for providing the water supply in Haldia City, West Bengal.|$|E

25|$|Past {{projects}} {{financed by}} KfW include a water supply project in Wadi Musa; an integrated poverty-oriented project targeted at refugees and squatters which included investments in {{water supply and}} sanitation; sewage disposal for Greater Irbid; and a trunk sewer and associated pumping stations linking up to the wastewater treatment plant As-Samra near Amman. In Wadi Musa the Euro 11.3 million project achieved, for a brief period, <b>continuous</b> <b>water</b> supply {{as well as a}} reduction in distribution losses. The project was co-financed by France and, concerning sanitation, by the US. The Euro 16.3 m poverty-oriented infrastructure project implemented by the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) of Jordan increased access to water and sanitation in two squatter settlements and four refugee camps. The investments in the camps were chosen in close dialogue with the residents who were organized in Community Improvement Committees, and were carried out between 1999 and 2002. The project complemented the World Bank-financed Community Infrastructure Development Project. The Euro 60.1 m Greater Irbid sewage disposal project (1994–2002) included the construction of two wastewater treatment plants and the associated sewer infrastructure connecting 202,000 residents, as well as training for operational staff. Both treatment plants operated satisfactorily four years after they had been completed. Residual sludge is being properly disposed on a landfill.|$|E
500|$|Cucurbita species {{fall into}} two main groups. The first group are annual or {{short-lived}} perennial vines and are mesophytic, i.e. they require {{a more or less}} <b>continuous</b> <b>water</b> supply. The second group are perennials growing in arid zones and so are xerophytic, tolerating dry conditions. Cultivated Cucurbita species were derived from the first group. Growing [...] in height or length, the plant stem produces tendrils to help it climb adjacent plants and structures or extend along the ground. Most species do not readily root from the nodes; a notable exception is C.ficifolia, and the four other cultivated mesophytes do this to a lesser extent. The vine of the perennial Cucurbita can become semiwoody if left to grow. There is wide variation in size, shape, and color among Cucurbita fruits, and even within a single species. C.ficifolia is an exception, being highly uniform in appearance. The morphological variation in the species C.pepo and C.maxima is so vast that its various subspecies and cultivars have been misidentified as totally separate species.|$|E
