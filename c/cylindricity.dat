5000|$|... 2007 - The TalyRond 395, a fully {{automated}} roundness and <b>cylindricity</b> instrument, {{introduced a new}} trend of automated, multiple measurements (such as surface texture and roundness) on the same instrument.|$|E
50|$|Since honing {{is a high}} {{precision}} process, it is also relatively expensive. Therefore, it is only used in components that demand {{the highest level of}} precision. It is typically the last manufacturing operation before the part is shipped to a customer. The dimensional size of the object is established by preceding operations, the last of which is usually grinding. Then the part is honed to improve a form characteristic such as roundness, flatness, <b>cylindricity,</b> or sphericity.|$|E
5000|$|Roundness is {{the measure}} of how closely {{the shape of an}} object {{approaches}} that of a mathematically perfect circle. Roundness applies in two dimensions, such as the cross sectional circles along a cylindrical object such as a shaft or a cylindrical roller for a bearing. In geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, control of a cylinder can also include its fidelity to the longitudinal axis, yielding <b>cylindricity.</b> The analogue of roundness in three dimensions (that is, for spheres) is sphericity.|$|E
5000|$|In {{metrology}} and {{the fields}} that it serves (such as manufacturing, machining, and engineering), {{total indicator reading}} (TIR), also known by the newer name full indicator movement (FIM), {{is the difference between}} the maximum and minimum measurements, that is, readings of an indicator, on the planar, cylindrical, or contoured surface of a part, showing its amount of deviation from flatness, roundness (circularity), <b>cylindricity,</b> concentricity with other cylindrical features, or similar conditions. The indicator traditionally would be a dial indicator; today dial-type and digital indicators coexist.|$|E
50|$|Primary form {{is used in}} surface {{metrology}} {{to refer}} to the over-all shape of a surface which can be measured quantitatively, as contrasted with more local or higher-spatial frequency variations in the surface dimensions such as surface waviness or surface roughness or surface finish. Examples of primary form include surface flatness, surface roundness, and surface <b>cylindricity.</b> Each of these classes of primary form can be quantitatively defined in several different ways depending upon the intended purpose of the surface, such a statistical least squares flatness, and overall flatness (aka max-min flatness).|$|E
50|$|The {{process is}} {{intended}} to replace or limit traditional grinding operations. Hard turning, when applied for purely stock removal purposes, competes favorably with rough grinding. However, when it is applied for finishing where form and dimension are critical, grinding is superior. Grinding produces higher dimensional accuracy of roundness and <b>cylindricity.</b> In addition, polished surface finishes of Rz=0.3-0.8z cannot be achieved with hard turning alone. Hard turning is appropriate for parts requiring roundness accuracy of 0.5-12 micrometres, and/or surface roughness of Rz 0.8-7.0 micrometres. It is used for gears, injection pump components, hydraulic components, among other applications.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes a part {{may require}} higher {{accuracy}} {{of form and}} size than can be provided by boring. For example, even in optimized boring, the amount that the diameter varies on different portions of the bore is seldom less than 3 micrometre (.0001 inches, [...] "a tenth"), and it may easily be 5 to 20 micrometre (.0002-.0008 inches, [...] "2 to 8 tenths"). Taper, roundness error, and <b>cylindricity</b> error of such a hole, although they would be considered negligible in most other parts, may be unacceptable for a few applications. For such parts, internal cylindrical grinding is a typical follow-up operation. Often a part will be roughed and semifinished in the machining operation, then heat treated, and finally, finished by internal cylindrical grinding.|$|E
5000|$|For most lathe boring applications, {{tolerances}} {{greater than}} ±0.010 in (±0.25 mm) are easily held. Tolerances from there down to ±0.005 in (±0.13 mm) are usually held without especial difficulty or expense, even in deep holes. Tolerances between ±0.004 in (±0.10 mm) and ±0.001 in (±0.025 mm) are where the challenge begins rising. In deep holes with tolerances this tight, the limiting factor {{is just as}} often the geometric constraint as the size constraint. In other words, it may be easy to hold the diameter within [...]002" [...] at any diametrical measurement point, but difficult to hold the <b>cylindricity</b> of the hole to within a zone delimited by the [...]002" [...] constraint, across more than 5 diameters of hole depth (depth {{measured in terms of}} diameter:depth aspect ratio). For highest-precision applications, tolerances can generally be held within ±0.0005 in (±0.013 mm) only for shallow holes. In some cases tolerances as tight as ±0.0001 in (±0.0038 mm) can be held in shallow holes, but it is expensive, with 100% inspection and loss of nonconforming parts adding to the cost. Grinding, honing, and lapping are the recourse for when the limits of boring repeatability and accuracy have been met.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − Products with {{cylindrical}} {{surfaces are}} manufactured in many (e. g. paper, chemical, steel, heating or shipping) industries. It is required that regular estimations of <b>cylindricity</b> profiles be {{made during the}} production process. The reference methods {{can be used for}} measurement of <b>cylindricity.</b> The <b>cylindricity</b> deviation includes the roundness deviation in different cross-sections of an object, the relative change of its diameter and the non-centricity of profiles in relation to the nominal axis of the object. The reference measurement systems applied nowadays enable measurement of roundness profiles in relation to fixed points of support in different cross-sections of the measured object. Furthermore, it is possible to evaluate the relative difference of the diameters. However, in traditional reference measurement systems there is no possibility of measurement of the non-concentricity of profiles. That is why appropriate reference systems for measurement of <b>cylindricity</b> have had to be developed. ...|$|E
40|$|Drilling {{is one of}} {{the most}} useful metal cutting {{processes}} and is used in various applications, such as aerospace, electronics, and automotive. In traditional drilling methods, the thrust force, torque, tolerance, and tribology (surface roughness) are related to the cutting condition and tool geometry. In this paper, the effects of a pre-center drill hole, tool material, and drilling strategy (including continuous and non-continuous feed) on thrust force, surface roughness, and dimensional accuracy (<b>cylindricity)</b> have been investigated. The results show that using pre-center drill holes leads to a reduction of the engagement force and an improvement in the surface quality and <b>cylindricity.</b> Non-continuous drilling reduces the average thrust force and <b>cylindricity</b> value, and High Speed Steels HSS-Mo (high steel speed + 5 – 8 % Mo) reduces the maximum quantity of cutting forces. Moreover, <b>cylindricity</b> is directly related to cutting temperature and is improved by using a non-continuous drilling strategy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cylindricity</b> {{specification}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important geometrical specifications in geometrical product development. This specification can be referenced from the rules and examples in tolerance standards and technical handbooks in practice. These rules and examples are described in the form of natural language, which may cause ambiguities since different designers may have different understandings on a rule or an example. To address the ambiguous problem, a categorical data model of <b>cylindricity</b> specification in the next-generation Geometrical Product Specifications (GPS) was proposed at the University of Huddersfield. The modeling language used in the categorical data model is category language. Even though category language can develop a syntactically correct data model, it is difficult to interpret the semantics of the <b>cylindricity</b> specification explicitly. This paper proposes an ontology-based approach to interpret the semantics of <b>cylindricity</b> specification on the basis of the categorical data model. A scheme for translating the category language to the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language (OWL 2) is presented in this approach. Through such a scheme, the categorical data model is translated into a semantically enriched model, i. e. an OWL 2 ontology for <b>cylindricity</b> specification. This ontology can interpret the semantics of <b>cylindricity</b> specification explicitly. As the benefits of such semantic interpretation, consistency checking, inference procedures and semantic queries can be performed on the OWL 2 ontology. The proposed approach could be easily extended to support the semantic interpretations of other kinds of geometrical specifications...|$|E

This paper presents a novel approach for machining holes on brittle material-quartz, using the in-house developed micro abrasive jet machine, wherein the nozzle is given a feed rate equal to the average rate of change of the workpiece thickness. The experiments are conducted to study {{the effect of this}} novel approach to the shape of the machined hole by measuring the entrance diameter and exit diameter and hence calculated the taper angle.

40|$|Abstract − In many {{industries}} (for example, in paper, electric or ship industry), {{large and}} heavy cylindrical elements play very important role. Such workpieces should posses very good quality {{of form and}} dimensions. Sometimes, they may be deformed under certain operating conditions, e. g. due to a high temperature or great external or internal loads. Consequently, wear and damage of the working surfaces are observed. Therefore <b>cylindricity</b> deviations of such workpieces should be measured during their manufacturing and exploitation. However, some of the workpieces cannot be measured accurately by existing measuring instruments because they are too large or too heavy and therefore they cannot {{be placed on the}} measuring table of the instrument. This is why the industries manufacturing or applying cylinders expect that measurements of <b>cylindricity</b> profiles will be made directly on the machine tool or in the work area. In the paper methods allowing such measurements are investigated. The methods are divided into two main groups: multisensor and V-block methods. Most important advantages and disadvantages of both groups of methods allowing accurate in situ <b>cylindricity</b> measurements are given as conclusions. The radius change measurements of <b>cylindricity</b> profiles are of a high metrological level. Characterised by high accuracy, they provide complete information of the analysed surface. However, the radius change measuring instruments are applied only if it is possible to place the workpiece on the measuring table...|$|E
40|$|After the 1916 {{success of}} General {{relativity}} that explained gravity by adding {{time as a}} fourth dimension, physicists {{have been trying to}} explain other physical fields by adding extra dimensions. In 1921, Kaluza and Klein has shown that under certain conditions like <b>cylindricity</b> (∂ g_ij/∂ x^ 5 = 0), the addition of the 5 th dimension can explain the electromagnetic field. The problem with this approach is that while the model itself is geometric, conditions like <b>cylindricity</b> are not geometric. This problem was partly solved by Einstein and Bergman who proposed, in their 1938 paper, that the 5 th dimension is compactified into a small circle S^ 1 so that in the resulting cylindric 5 D space-time R^ 4 × S^ 1 the dependence on x^ 5 is not macroscopically noticeable. We show that if, in all definitions of vectors, tensors, etc., we replace R^ 4 with R^ 4 × S^ 1, then conditions like <b>cylindricity</b> automatically follow [...] i. e., these conditions become fully geometric.

This research is done in cooperation with the company Schut Geometrical Metrology, manufacturing coordinate measuring machines primarily for use in metrology. A point set P results from measuring a part. Based on the <b>cylindricity</b> of P the part is accepted or rejected. This research has two distinct goals.

40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} hole quality on AISI H 13 {{hardened}} steel using high-speed drilling. Specimens were machined with new and worn out drills with 8. 6 mm diameter and (TiAl) N coating. Two levels of cutting speed and {{three levels of}} cooling/lubrication systems (flooded, minimum lubrication quantity, and dry) were used. The hole quality is evaluated on surface roughness (Ra) parameter, diameter error, circularity, and <b>cylindricity</b> error. A statistical analysis of the results shows that the cooling/lubrication system significantly affects the hole quality for all measured variables. This analysis indicates that dry machining produces the worst results. Higher cutting speeds not only prove beneficial to diameter error and circularity errors, but also show no significant difference on surface roughness and <b>cylindricity</b> errors. The effects {{of the interaction between}} the cooling/lubrication systems, tool wear, and cutting speed indicate that only <b>cylindricity</b> error is influenced. Thus, the conclusion is that the best hole quality is produced with a higher cutting speed using flooded or minimum lubrication quantity independent of drill wear...|$|E
40|$|Evaluating <b>cylindricity</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} application in metrology. In this paper, we focus on <b>cylindricity</b> evaluation based on radial form measurements. The standard characterization of <b>cylindricity</b> is the notion of zone cylinder, i. e. the cylindrical crown contained between two coaxial cylinders with minimum radial separation and containing all the data points. Unfortunately, the construction of the zone cylinder is a very complex geometric problem, which can be formulated as a nonlinear optimization. Recently a new method (referred to here as the hyperboloid method) has been discussed, which avoids the direct construction of the zone cylinder of a point set, but approximates it with guaranteed accuracy through a computationally very efficient iterative process based on a linearization of the underlying problem. The iterations can be viewed as the construction of a sequence of “zone hyperboloids ” tending to the desired “zone cylinder. ” An important requirement of the method, however, is that the initial position of the cylindrical specimen axis be nearly vertical, since significant deviations from this condition essentially invalidate the process. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to remove this shortcoming of the hyperboloid technique by providing a simple procedure for appropriately initializing the data (axis estimation). Axis estimation and the hyperboloid technique constitute an integrated methodology for <b>cylindricity</b> evaluation, which is currently the most effective. The theoretical foundations of the method are reviewed from a viewpoint that highlights its essential features and intuitively explains its effectiveness. The analytical discussion is complemented by experimental data concerning a few significant samples...|$|E

Besides, it is crucial because it can determine the performance of the parts like the application used in transmission system.

Cylindrical parts can be produced by using many machines and processes that are available. Numerous factors in manufacturing processes may cause a cylindrical part to depart from its ideal shape. It is essential to design proper experiment for assessing <b>cylindricity.</b> Therefore, the choice of the best combination parameters is important to control the cylindrical geometry.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} the effect of {{drilling}} parameters on tool wear and hole quality in terms of diameter error, roundness, <b>cylindricity,</b> and surface roughness. In this work, the drilling was conducted using uncoated carbide tool with diameter of 4 ± 0. 01 mm with point angle of 135 ° and helix angle of 30 °. The drilling was done at different levels of spindle speed (18 and 30 mmin- 1) and feed rate (0. 03, 0. 045 and 0. 06 mmrev- 1). Austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 L was the workpiece material. Comparatives analysis was done on hole diameter, roundness, <b>cylindricity,</b> and surface roughness of the drilled holes by experimentation. From the result, the hole quality characteristics are mostly influenced by cutting speed and feed rate. An exception was for circularity error where a two tail t-test for circularity error indicates that cutting speed and feed rate give no significant influence on circularity error. As the cutting speed increases, the surface roughness decreases (1. 09 μm). Contrary, when the feed rate increases, the surface roughness value increases as well. For <b>cylindricity</b> error, lower cutting speed and lower feed rate will give better result. In terms of diameter error, feed rate influences more than cutting speed. Minimum diameter error was achieved when low cutting speed and low feed rate were employed...|$|E

This paper presents a new approach aimed at extending the method proposed for profile monitoring to surface monitoring. In this case, a geometric specification (such as <b>cylindricity,</b> flatness, etc.) is assumed to characterize the machined surface.

A further aim is to use grey relational analysis {{to improve the quality of}} the drilled holes. The machining parameters were measured according to 3 (3) full factorial parameter designs (27 experiments with independent process variables). The experiments were carried out under various cutting parameters with different spindle speeds and feed rates. Drilling tests were done using WC carbide, high-speed steel (HSS), and TiN-coated carbide drills. The experiment design was accomplished by application of the statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results show that the thrust force is mainly influenced by the tool materials and the feed rate, which has a strong influence on the exit delamination factor.
