40|$|The asset {{participation}} {{relationship between}} the state and the corporate entity is an essential determinant of corporate value in the natural resource sector. Natural re-sources deplete, with the result that oil reserve replacement is an accepted imperative for companies that derive earnings and balance sheet values from global resource assets. Corporate asset values in the sector are underpinned by entitlement to future reserves. Specifically, I show that the global nature of government participation varies and that it matters in which country reserves are held since entitlement structures directly deter-mine how the state and corporate producers share economic rents from resource assets. My global Oil and Gas (O&G) sector study provides market evidence of economic and state variable limits on the value of globalization. Findings revise the low oil price paradigm covered in prior studies and provide evi-dence that, for O&G producers concerned with reserve replacement, global asset values are directly affected by state entitlement terms. In developed OECD countries, state and <b>corporate</b> <b>agent</b> participation terms are price insensitive, and take the form of concession contracts with royalty or profit taxation terms. By contrast, in emerging NON-OECD countries state agents participate on production sharing terms that are linked to the market price of oil. Relative to comparable OECD oil assets, the value of <b>corporate</b> <b>agent</b> participation in Non-OECD O&G assets is limited by explicit and progressive state agent participation terms that favour sovereign state agent returns. I show that unless price sensitive entitlement clauses are is included in the value of cash flow expectations, state participation terms potentially invert risk return convention under conditions of increasing oil prices. The Fama and French (1993) framework is used to provide market evidence of economic state variable limits on the returns for O&G companies with relatively high asset holdings in Non-OECD countries...|$|E

Complementing and extending the concepts developed in the SIMSEG simulation environment of Working Paper No. 60 this report proceeds in two steps. (1) it outlines the basic constructs and consumer behavior phenomena implemented in the ACM in a nontechnical manner. (2) it elaborates the formal structure and relationships in full detail. The ACM was never headed for mimicking any real consumer market. However, it is ambitious enough to capture a number of behavioral mechanisms that are deemed crucial for exposing the Artificial Firms ’ analytical and strategic agents to a challenging artificial marketplace. 1 Purpose of the Artificial Consumer Market as a simulation environment The Artificial Consumer Market (ACM) is part of an Artificial Economy (AE) project headed for exploring the consequences of economic agents ’ learning behaviors that gradually increase in complexity.

40|$|Recently, {{a number}} of people have argued that certain {{entities}} embodied by groups of agents themselves qualify as agents, with their own (analogs of) beliefs, desires, and intentions; even, some claim, as moral agents. However, others have independently argued that fully-fledged moral agency involves a capacity for reactive attitudes such as guilt and indignation, and these capacities might seem beyond the ken of “collective” or “corporate” agents. Individuals embodying such agents can of course be ashamed, proud, or indignant about what the agent has done. But just as an entity needs to have its own beliefs, desires, and intentions to qualify as a bona fide agent, the required capacity for reactive attitudes is a capacity to have one’s own reactive attitudes. If fully-fledged moral agency requires reactive attitudes, the <b>corporate</b> <b>agent</b> must itself be capable of (analogs of) guilt and indignation. In this paper, we argue that at least certain corporate agents are. Or, more precisely, we argue that if there are bona fide corporate agents, these agents can have the capacities that are both associated with guilt and indignation and plausibly required for moral agency; in particular certain epistemic and motivational capacities...|$|E

Middle managers occupy a pivotal role within the complex working environment of colleges, translating the purpose and vision of the college into practical activity and outcomes, yet there is little empirically-based understanding of the roles they perform. Case study research at four colleges drew on data from senior managers, middle managers and their teams, college documents and observation of meetings. The enquiry focused upon the aspects of role performed by the managers, the environment for management within which they carry out their role, and features of the college environment which enable and impede them in their work. Five aspects of role were identified and discussed, those of <b>corporate</b> <b>agent,</b> implementer, staff manager, liaison and leader. Analysis focused upon the managers' resolution of the tension between the mechanical need to support whole-college homogeneity, and the organic need to develop departmental specialisms and respond to the differentiated needs of staff, students and clients. Factors within the college environment which impact positively and negatively upon the role were discussed and modelled in order to locate the key influences upon the effectiveness of the manager role, and thereby the effectiveness of the college. The emergent factors were: the college structures and territories; the design of college operational systems; the position of the manager in relation to the college structure, purpose and values; the coherence and status of the manager role; the degree of autonomy experienced by the manager, and the manager's identification with leadership. The research generated reflection on whole-college coherence, role coherence and professionalism. Discussion throughout the investigation focused upon emerging definitions of professionalism within further education colleges, and, whilst the concept is not yet fully defined, hopefully this study will contribute to its understanding...|$|E
40|$|Defence date: 10 January 2014 Examining Board: Professor Dennis Patterson, European University Institute, Law (Supervisor) Professor Rainer Baubock, European University Institute, SPS Professor Leif Wenar, King’s College London Professor Georges Pavlakos, Antwerp University. While the {{discourse}} surrounding corporate responsibilities is ubiquitous these days, justificatory accounts of corporate responsibilities, i. e. normative {{accounts of the}} grounds upon which responsibilities are to be articulated {{are not part of}} the discussion. The lack of justificatory accounts is particularly stark with respect to potential responsibilities of corporate agents concerning the socio-economic rights of poor population in ‘burdened’ societies. As corporations have garnered public power through the constitutive force of the investment regime, no satisfactory account of correlative responsibilities is articulated. This thesis argues that this lack is caused by an existent disciplinary parallelism that foregoes engagement with the structural issue of corporate responsibilities as viewed under an institutional lens: Where liberal justice theory assumes away corporate agency for its institutional bias, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Business and Human Rights (BHR) mirror justice theory by assuming the <b>corporate</b> <b>agent</b> to be merely a private, economic agent. This thesis argues that this parallelism allows for a troubling lacuna in normative proposals that satisfactorily deal with the responsibilities corporate agents ought to be ascribed as public powers. In as much, this thesis problematizes the question of responsibilities corporate agents hold in light of their role in the creation, perpetuation and potential abatement of poverty. Since this is a question that concerns the side of the duty-bearer, the thesis focuses on an understanding of the agency of the corporation and the normative implications to be drawn from such an understanding. Arguing the lack of satisfactory justificatory accounts of corporate responsibilities that provide for guidance on corporate investment in burdened society, this thesis ends by developing a Basic Structure Model (BSM) as a viable tool to fill the lacuna in satisfactory normative proposals. In as much, the BSM can serve as a normative benchmark against which corporate engagement in burdened societies can be evaluated and reform can be effectuated...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} health reform under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 {{will depend upon}} the {{sustainability}} of a brand new and infrastructure of entities, relationships, and procedures. So far, neither jurists, legislators, policy-makers, providers, payers, nor patients have identified an organizing paradigm to implement or regulate this vast new infrastructure. Legal scholars have been curiously absent from this policy discussion, offering little if any insight into the role law plays beyond the familiar political debates about health reform. This article draws a legal chair {{to the table and}} takes a refined look at the legal basis for implementing the health reform. Building upon fiduciary law that already governs numerous aspects of medical relationships, in this article I present a new paradigm called the “fiduciary medicine model” to advance the proposition that fiduciary law – particularly agency theory – provides the best conceptual model for understanding and organizing this nation’s emerging health care system. I argue here that fiduciary law should replace contract and tort rules to better address the inevitable challenges that reformers will face. Although courts and scholars currently apply fiduciary law in a haphazard manner to regulate some interactions between providers, payers, and individual patients, I argue to correct this limited view. First, I clarify that one size fiduciary law does not fit all medical relationships. This correction alone will have far-reaching impact as it will help to rectify the Supreme Court’s error in the landmark case, Pegram v. Herdrich. Next I show that within America’s medical industrial complex, patients no longer act individually as principals in medical agency relationships, but instead function in aggregate, contractual groups. The agents with whom these patient groups contract are networks of providers, insurers, health plans, and employers who also act as agents, sub-agents, and principals among themselves. To make sense of this tangle, I introduce lessons learned from economic agency theory. Next, building on popular sovereignty literature, I offer a completely new analogy to show that in health care, the state operates through government officials, much like a <b>corporate</b> <b>agent</b> of the people. In fact, the principal-agent relationship {{lies at the heart of}} our democratic form of government. Thus agency law may be read to impose a fiduciary duty upon government to manage competing interests in health care in accordance with the social norms of our democracy – justice, equality, and liberty – and to implement expressed societal goals. The article concludes by offering a model enabling statute, patterned after the Uniform Prudent Investor Act, designed to address some of the most likely objections to the fiduciary medicine model...|$|E

40|$|This article investigates {{whether it}} is {{possible}} and recommendable that corporate criminal responsibility should be introduced for international crimes and that the International Criminal Court should therefore have jurisdiction over legal entities. This article adopts the French proposal on corporate criminal liability, presented during the drafting process of the Rome Statute, as preliminary normative framework, and links this framework with case law of both domestic and international criminal courts in which individual business leaders stood trial on charges of complicity in international crimes. The recurrent question is whether {{it would have been}} fair and feasible in those situations to hold the legal entity which these <b>corporate</b> <b>agents</b> were representing criminally responsible as well.

The author argues that the cases which have been investigated represent particularly strong instances of corporate involvement in international crimes.
