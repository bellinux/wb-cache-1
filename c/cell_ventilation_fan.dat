40|$|The {{use of a}} {{mechanical}} <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> is one strategy that can be employed to reduce high air temperature build up in a car passenger compartment when it is parked in the sun. This study developed a numerical simulation to investigate the effects of using a <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> on the air temperature inside the passenger compartment when it is parked in the open space during a sunny day. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method was used to perform the numerical simulations. FLUENT software was employed to develop the passenger compartment model and simulate the air flow conditions inside the passenger compartment. The validation of the numerical simulation was done by comparing the air temperatures from the CFD simulation results against the air temperatures at two selected points obtained from the field measurement from 12 pm to 3 pm. On average, the air temperature prediction at {{the front and rear}} compartment show good agreement with the measured data, with a difference of about 2. 5 % and 1. 6 %, respectively. The validated numerical simulation was used to perform a parametric study to investigate the effects of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> location, number of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>fans</b> as well as the air velocity at the <b>ventilation</b> <b>fans,</b> on the air temperature and air flow pattern inside the passenger compartment. A threedimensional (3 D) steady-state simulation results show that placing one <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> at the rear deck with an air velocity of 2. 84 m/s reduces the air temperature at the front and rear compartment by 4 °C. Placing four <b>ventilation</b> <b>fans</b> at the roof lowers the air temperatures at the front and rear compartments by 6 °C and 7 °C, respectively. Increasing the air velocity from 2. 84 m/s to 15. 67 m/s at four <b>ventilation</b> <b>fans</b> placed at the roof suggests the highest reduction of the air temperature inside the passenger compartment by 8 °C...|$|R

It was found from a measurement that the air temperature inside the passenger compartment could raise up to 48 °C. Computational fluid dynamics method was used to develop model of the compartment and carry out flow simulations to predict the air temperature distribution at 1 pm for two conditions: without <b>ventilation</b> <b>fans</b> and with <b>ventilation</b> <b>fans.</b> The effects of fan location, number of fans used and fan airflow velocity were examined.

When three fans were used, an additional 3. 4 % temperature reduction was attained. Placing two <b>ventilation</b> <b>fans</b> at the middle of the roof also reduced the air temperature by 17 %. When four fans were used a further 4. 8 % temperature reduction was achieved. Increasing the airflow velocity at the four fans placed at the roof, from 2. 84 m/s to 15. 67 m/s, caused only a small reduction in the air temperature inside the passenger compartment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{aimed at}} establishing {{the ability of}} a tunnel <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> to operate without risk of mechanical failure in the event of aerodynamic stall. The research establishes the aerodynamic characteristics of a typical tunnel <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> when operated in both stable and stalled aerodynamic conditions, with and without an anti-stall stabilisation ring, with and without a “nonstalling” blade angle and at full, half, and one quarter design speed. It also measures the fan’s peak stress, thus facilitating an analysis of the implications of the experimental results for mechanical design methodology. The paper concludes by presenting three different strategies for tunnel <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> selection in applications where the selected fan will most likely stall. The first strategy selects a fan with a low-blade angle that is nonstalling. The second strategy selects a fan with a high-pressure developing capability.

40|$|Tunnel <b>ventilation</b> <b>fans</b> are {{subjected}} to pressure pulses {{as a consequence of}} trains passing the ventilation shafts within which they are installed. These pressure pulses alter the volume flow rate through a <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan,</b> and consequently the static pressure field around fan blades. Today's trains typically travel through railway tunnels faster than has been the historic norm. Additionally, platform screen doors are now a standard feature of metro systems. Both result in the trains involved inducing larger pressure pulses than industrial fan designers have traditionally assumed. Although tunnel <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> in-service failures are rare, engineers increasingly associate those failures with new or renovated tunnel systems with larger pressure pulses. Consequently, we require insight into the aerodynamic and mechanical consequences that occur with subjecting a tunnel <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> to a pressure pulse. In the research reported in this paper, the authors model the pressure pulse induced by a train in a tunnel system as a rapidly changing fan volume flow rate. The authors computed the fan operating point by means of a large eddy simulation with a one-equation sub-grid scale turbulence model. The authors undertook the computation using the open source computational fluid dynamic code OpenFOAM. An analysis of the computational results provides an insight into the effects of turbulent structures that develop within the fan blade passage. The analysis indicates that a pressure pulse too brief to drive a tunnel <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> into stall still results a doubling of the unsteady aerodynamic and mechanical forces to which the blade is subjected. A doubling of unsteady mechanical forces as a consequence of a pressure pulse constitutes an increase significant enough to contribute to the tunnel ventilation fan's in-service mechanical failure...|$|R

So, it is relatively challenging to appropriately control mine <b>ventilation</b> <b>fans</b> {{in order to maintain}} Occupational Health and Safety standards for workers. Moreover, advanced ventilation control systems can bring major improvements in high environmental impact mine sites. This project focuses on the study, investigation and development of a new control system for the exhaust mine <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> at the Crocodile Gold mine site which is located 60 Km North of Pine Creek. Employed in the control system are a Programmable Logic Array (PLC) and a Human Machine Interface (HMI) that provides both flexibility of control & ease of operation.

This paper describes research and development that showed the feasibility of a regenerative blower that is uniquely suited to meet these requirements. We proved feasibility through component tests, blower tests, and design analysis. Based on the requirements for the Constellation Space Suit Element (CSSE) Portable Life Support System (PLSS) <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan,</b> we designed the critical elements of the blower. We measured the effects of key design parameters on blower performance using separate effects tests, and used {{the results of these}} tests to design a regenerative blower that will meet the <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> requirements.

The proof-of-concept blower produced the flow rate and pressure rise needed for the CSSE ventilation subsystem while running at 5400 rpm, consuming only 9 W of electric power using a non-optimized, commercial motor and controller and inefficient bearings.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) developed, and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) recently approved, a new residential ventilation Standard 62. 2 - 2003, which would require many new homes to have a mechanical ventilation system. However, Standard 62. 2 sizes <b>ventilation</b> <b>fans</b> {{in such a way}} that the tighter the home, and the more it needs mechanical ventilation, the less likely it is to receive the minimum ventilation rate of 0. 35 air-changes/hour. This thesis uses the multi-zone building airflow software model CONTAMW to compare hourly air-change rates in a typical new home during a typical meteorological year in the moderate climate of Houston Texas. Two building parameters are varied in this analysis: leakage area (or airtightness), and <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> size. There are three leakage scenarios: typical new construction, energy-efficient new construction, and tightest construction in the U.

Air-change results are analyzed for time spent under-ventilated, adequately ventilated, and over-ventilated, and for exhaust ventilation efficiency, which is defined as percent of total ventilation attributable to the fan. Results indicate that exhaust fans sized according to Standard 62. 2 improve ventilation only marginally in typical new construction, while energy-efficient or tighter homes would be significantly under-ventilated. This thesis suggests revising Standard 62. 2 to: 1) size <b>ventilation</b> <b>fans</b> to ensure a minimum ventilation rate, regardless of house tightness, and 2) address the impact of tightness on ventilation system performance...|$|R
