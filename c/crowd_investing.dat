The term equity crowdfunding {{is often used}} to describe <b>crowd</b> <b>investing</b> into both debt and equity based instruments when they are offered on an equity crowdfunding platform. The first known equity based crowdfunding platform for startups was launched as a private beta in June, 2009 by Grow VC Group followed by full commercial launch in February 2010 The first US. based company ProFounder launched model for startups to raise investments directly on the site in May 2011, but deciding later to shut down its business due regulatory reasons preventing them from continuing, having launched their model prior to JOBS Act. Early platforms include CrowdCube and Seedrs in the UK. Others like the European startup Exorot.com invest their own money in every new startup on top of investment received from others on their website.|$|E

30|$|Crowdfunding is a {{relatively}} new way of collecting small amounts of funding by directly appealing to potential investors via the Internet. It often requires investors to judge project risks. Research suggests that risk judgment associated with loans and ventures may require special knowledge and expertise (Diacon 2004; Glaser and Weber 2007). However, individual investors in a pure <b>crowd</b> typically <b>invest</b> relatively small amounts of money and receive {{a relatively}} small stake of a company in return (e.g., Malmendier and Shanthikumar 2007). Thus, they may not have the necessary expertise to reach a high-quality risk judgment.|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsEquity {{crowdfunding}} is {{a phenomenon}} that is emerging at this very moment. Although charity funding has existed for probably, centuries and reward based for years there is natural development and continuation aspiring now. The next big step is equity crowdfunding open for broad public. So far, only certain qualified private investors and private entities were eligible. The challenge is to open it for everyone. The process will truly take off when regulation authorities in the countries around the globe will adopt the laws and rules for that. New rules apply to crowdfunding platforms from October 2014 in UK and in USA; {{they are in the}} final process of negotiation. There are many opportunities and pitfalls. First, the current equity crowdfunding experience studied to draw some conclusions for future development. Few examples from already funded projects used to illustrate the points. This work focuses on the key areas of public available crowdfunding also called <b>crowd</b> <b>investing.</b> Probable solutions discussed and criticism from experienced private investors addressed. Different countries are trying to overcome the fact that their securities regulations and laws adopted long before the term crowdfunding came into life. Few countries exemptions from current regulations studied and compared. Based on the information collected a model for equity crowdfunding process is discussed. Discussion includes proposal to special equity crowdfunding security note and what properties it should have. Some thoughts on further process regulation like continuous funding campaign, internal and external audits by venture backers are described. A potential evolutionary way of funding through funds and further development of crowdfunding platforms is proposed. The whole crowdfunding process is looked at solely through perspective of a technological startup venture searching for the funding and other cases are omitted. The most attention is paid to equity in form of securities funding. Lending, as being mostly, a straightforward process, is touched briefly and mostly overlooked. Further research section lists opportunities for investigation as the whole process rolls out over time...|$|E

40|$|Equity-based {{crowdfunding}} is {{an increasingly}} popular source to fund start-ups. In equity-based crowdfunding, {{a form of}} crowdsourcing, many crowdfundees collectively fund a start-up by providing parts of the requested funding in prospect of financial returns. While extant research has provided insights into the crowd’s motives for participating in various forms of crowdsourcing initiatives, we know little about the motivations that drive the <b>crowd</b> to <b>invest</b> in start-ups via crowdfunding. In literature, there are ongoing calls to investigate this phenomenon since {{it is expected that}} motives for investing in start-ups via crowdfunding differ from motives for engaging in other forms of crowdsourcing initiatives. Against this background, this research aims at investigating why crowdfundees fund start-ups. In this research-in-progress paper we build on related literature t...|$|R

Regarding the structure of this thesis, we will firstly explain in details what are the roots of the crowdfunding, describe the different type of platforms and in which context they are used. In the second and third part, we will see how crowdfunding represent a boost for the entrepreneurial initiative and how digital marketing is influencing the process of a raising fund campaign. Finally, thanks a research that has been conducted on 46 respondents, we will analyze the behavior of the crowd regarding the marketing approach used by crowdfunders. As findings, we can state that a crowdfunder must establish a project with a substantial quality content that will pull the crowd toward the project, and choose the right approach in selecting an adapted crowdfunding platforms and rewards...|$|R
40|$|In Crowdfunding platforms, {{people turn}} their {{prototype}} ideas into real products by raising {{money from the}} <b>crowd,</b> or <b>invest</b> in someone else's projects. In reward-based crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, selecting accurate reward delivery duration becomes crucial for creators, backers, and platform providers to keep the trust between the creators and the backers, and the trust between the platform providers and users. According to Kickstarter, 35 % backers did not receive rewards on time. Unfortunately, {{little is known about}} on-time and late reward delivery projects, and there is no prior work to estimate reward delivery duration. To fill the gap, in this paper, we (i) extract novel features that reveal latent difficulty levels of project rewards; (ii) build predictive models to identify whether a creator will deliver all rewards in a project on time or not; and (iii) build a regression model to estimate accurate reward delivery duration (i. e., {{how long it will take}} to produce and deliver all the rewards). Experimental results show that our models achieve good performance [...] 82. 5 % accuracy, 78. 1 RMSE, and 0. 108 NRMSE at the first 5 % of the longest reward delivery duration...|$|R

40|$|Newspapers {{and weekly}} {{magazines}} {{catering to the}} <b>investing</b> <b>crowd</b> often rank funds according to the returns generated in the past. Aside from satisfying sheer curiosity, these numbers are probably also the basis on which investors pick a fund to invest in. In this article, we fully characterize the equilibrium in a game between a mutual fund manager of unknown ability who controls the riskiness of his portfolio and investors who only observe realized returns. We derive conditions under which (i) investors invest in the fund if the realized return falls within some interval, i. e., is neither too low nor too high, (ii) an informed fund manager picks a portfolio of minimal riskiness and (iii) an uninformed mutual fund manager will pick a portfolio with higher risk, “gambling” on a lucky outcome, (iv), when the fee structure is endogenous, both types of manager choose the same fraction-of-fund fee structure. Our {{results are consistent with}} empirical evidence about the lack of persistence of top performance, and about the very wide use of fraction-of-fund fee structure among mutual funds...|$|R
5000|$|In {{ecological}} {{terms the}} reproductive {{pattern of the}} American kestrel leans towards a small bird [...] "r-selection" [...] strategy. [...] In r/K selection theory, selective pressures are hypothesised to drive evolution {{in one of two}} generalized directions: r- or K-selection. [...] R-selected species are those that place an emphasis on a high growth rate, typically exploiting less-crowded ecological niches, and produce many offspring, each of which has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood (i.e., high r, low K). By contrast, K-selected species display traits associated with living at densities close to carrying capacity, and typically are strong competitors in such <b>crowded</b> niches that <b>invest</b> more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood (i.e., low r, high K). Between these two extremes the American kestrel {{is one of the few}} raptor species that lean towards being r-selected. They are able to breed at one year old, have few non-breeding adults in the population, and have larger broods. Their population growth rate is high relative to larger raptors, which typically lean towards being K-selected.|$|R

As a piece of color, and light and shade, it is altogether [...] marvellous. Of all the fifty figures which the picture contains, there [...] is not one which in any way injures or contends with another; nay, [...] there is not a single fold of garment or touch of the pencil which [...] could be spared; every virtue of Tintoret, as a painter, is there in [...] its highest degree,--color at once the most intense and the most [...] delicate, the utmost decision in the arrangement of masses of light, [...] and yet half tones and modulations of endless variety; and all [...] executed with a magnificence of handling which no words are energetic [...] enough to describe. I have hardly ever seen a picture in which there [...] was so much decision, and so little impetuosity, and in which so [...] little was conceded to haste, to accident, or to weakness. It is too [...] infinite a work to be describable; but among its minor passages of [...] extreme beauty, should especially be noticed the manner in which the [...] accumulated forms of the human body, which fill the picture from end [...] to end, are prevented from being felt heavy, by the grace and [...] elasticity of two or three sprays of leafage which spring from a [...] broken root in the foreground, and rise conspicuous in shadow against [...] an interstice filled by the pale blue, grey, and golden light in which [...] the distant <b>crowd</b> is <b>invested,</b> the office of this foliage being, in an [...] artistical point of view, correspondent to that of the trees set by [...] the sculptors of the Ducal Palace on its angles. But they have a far [...] more important meaning in the picture than any artistical one. If the [...] spectator will look carefully at the root which I have called broken, [...] he will find that in reality, it is not broken, but cut; the other [...] branches of the young tree having lately been cut away. When we [...] remember that one of the principal incidents in great San Rocco [...] Crucifixion is the ass feeding on withered palm leaves, we shall be at [...] no loss to understand the great painter's purpose in lifting the [...] branch of this mutilated olive against the dim light of the distant [...] sky; while, close beside it, St. Joseph of Arimathea drags along the [...] dust a white garment--observe, the principal light of the [...] picture,--stained with the blood of that King before whom, five days [...] before, his crucifiers had strewn their own garments in the way.|$|R
