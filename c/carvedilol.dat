25|$|The {{progress}} in β-blocker development {{led to the}} introduction of drugs with variety of properties. β-blockers were developed having a relative selectivity for cardiac β1-receptors (for example metoprolol and atenolol), partial adrenergic agonist activity (pindolol), concomitant α-adrenergic blocking activity (for example labetalol and <b>carvedilol)</b> and additional direct vasodilator activity (nebivolol). In addition, long-acting and ultra-short formulations of β-blockers were developed. In 1988, Sir James Black was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on drug development.|$|E
25|$|Until {{recently}} (within {{the last}} 20 years), β-blockers were contraindicated in CHF, owing to their negative inotropic effect {{and ability to}} produce bradycardia – effects which worsen heart failure. However, current guidelines recommend β-blocker therapy for patients with systolic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction after stabilization with diuretic and ACEI therapy, irrespective of symptomatic severity or blood pressure. As with ACEI therapy, {{the addition of a}} β-blocker can decrease mortality and improve left ventricular function. Several β-blockers are specifically indicated for CHF including: bisoprolol, <b>carvedilol,</b> nebivolol and extended-release metoprolol. The antagonism of β1 inotropic and chronotropic effects decreases the amount of work the heart must perform. It is also thought that catecholamines and other sympathomimetics have an effect on cardiac remodeling, and blocking their activity can slow the deterioration of cardiac function.|$|E
25|$|The main {{goals of}} {{treatment}} in angina pectoris are relief of symptoms, slowing {{progression of the}} disease, and reduction of future events, especially heart attacks and death. Beta blockers (e.g., <b>carvedilol,</b> propranolol, atenolol) have {{a large body of}} evidence in morbidity and mortality benefits (fewer symptoms, less disability and longer life) and short-acting nitroglycerin medications have been used since 1879 for symptomatic relief of angina. Calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine (Adalat) and amlodipine), isosorbide mononitrate and nicorandil are vasodilators commonly used in chronic stable angina. A new therapeutic class, called If inhibitor, has recently been made available: Ivabradine provides pure heart rate reduction leading to major anti-ischemic and antianginal efficacy. ACE inhibitors are also vasodilators with both symptomatic and prognostic benefit. Statins are the most frequently used lipid/cholesterol modifiers, which probably also stabilize existing atheromatous plaque. Low-dose aspirin decreases the risk of heart attack in patients with chronic stable angina, and was part of standard treatment. However, in patients without established cardiovascular disease, the increase in hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal bleeding offsets any benefits and it is no longer advised unless the risk of myocardial infarction is very high.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>carvedilol</b> {{is bound to}} plasma proteins (98%), mainly to albumin. <b>Carvedilol</b> is a basic, hydrophobic compound with a steady-state volume of distribution of 115 L. Plasma clearance ranges from 500 to 700 mL/min.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carvedilol</b> {{blockade}} of α1 receptors causes vasodilation of blood vessels. This inhibition leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance and an antihypertensive effect. There is no reflex tachycardia response due to <b>carvedilol</b> {{blockade of}} β1 receptors on the heart.|$|E

50|$|The mean {{half-life}} of <b>carvedilol</b> following {{oral administration}} ranges from 7 to 10 hours. <b>Carvedilol</b> has two enantiomers: R(+)-carvedilol and S(-)-carvedilol. R(+)-carvedilol undergoes preferential selection for metabolism, so the mean half-life of the enantiomer is about 5 to 9 hours compared with 7 to 11 {{hours for the}} S(-)-enantiomer.|$|E
50|$|The agents <b>carvedilol</b> and {{labetalol}} {{are both}} α- and &beta;-blockers.|$|E
50|$|According to the FDA, <b>carvedilol</b> {{should not}} be used in people with {{bronchial}} asthma or bronchospastic conditions. It {{should not be}} used in people with second- or third-degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome, severe bradycardia (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or a decompensated heart condition. People with severe hepatic impairment are also advised to not take <b>carvedilol.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nebivolol {{is unique}} as a beta-blocker. Unlike <b>carvedilol,</b> {{it has a}} nitric oxide (NO)-potentiating, vasodilatory effect via {{stimulation}} of β3 receptors. Along with labetalol, celiprolol and <b>carvedilol,</b> {{it is one of}} four beta blockers to cause dilation of blood vessels in addition to effects on the heart. However, recent studies question the clinical relevance of this property to Nebivolol's efficacy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carvedilol</b> may mask {{symptoms}} of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), resulting in hypoglycemia unawareness. This is termed beta blocker induced hypoglycemia unawareness.|$|E
50|$|Some beta {{blockers}} (e.g., labetalol and <b>carvedilol)</b> exhibit mixed antagonism of both β- and α1-adrenergic receptors, which provides additional arteriolar vasodilating action.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carvedilol</b> is not {{recommended}} for people with uncontrolled bronchospastic disease (e.g. current asthma symptoms) as it can block receptors that assist in opening the airways.|$|E
50|$|Absorption is slowed when {{administered}} with food, however, it {{does not}} show {{a significant difference in}} bioavailability. Taking <b>carvedilol</b> with food decreases the risk of orthostatic hypotension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carvedilol</b> was {{discovered}} by Fritz Wiedemann at Boehringer Mannheim and was initially approved in the U.S. in 1995. On October 20, 2006, the FDA approved an extended-release formulation.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{frequently}} cited articles include work on <b>Carvedilol</b> [...] and cardiac hypertrophy. He {{is also the}} author of a book on heart disease, Before It Happens To You.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carvedilol</b> {{is both a}} non-selective beta {{adrenergic}} receptor blocker (β1, β2) and an alpha {{adrenergic receptor}} blocker (α1). The S(-) enantiomer accounts for the beta blocking activity whereas the S(-) and R(+) enantiomer have alpha blocking activity.|$|E
50|$|In addition, <b>carvedilol</b> is {{indicated}} {{in the treatment of}} hypertension and to reduce risk of mortality and hospitalizations in a subset of people following a heart attack. It can be used alone or with other anti-hypertensive agents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carvedilol,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coreg among others, is a beta blocker used for {{treating}} mild to severe congestive heart failure (CHF), left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) following heart attack in people who are otherwise stable, and for treating high blood pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Beta {{blockers}} {{block the}} beta receptors on heart muscle and other cells, {{making them more}} relaxed and less responsive to stress hormones. <b>Carvedilol</b> also blocks alpha receptors, which are found on blood vessels, and relaxes the blood vessels, dilating them, which lowers blood pressure and vascular resistance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carvedilol</b> {{reversibly}} binds to beta adrenergic receptors on cardiac myocytes. Inhibition {{of these}} receptors prevents {{a response to}} the sympathetic nervous system, leading to decreased heart rate and contractility. This action is beneficial in heart failure patients where the sympathetic nervous system is activated as a compensatory mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Bernstein {{joined the}} Columbia University faculty in 1993 in the Division of Circulatory Physiology, where he {{established}} its clinical research program. As a clinical investigator, he accumulated a large {{experience with the}} beta-blocker <b>carvedilol</b> prior to the application by its developer (GlaxoSmithKline) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).|$|E
50|$|He {{has been}} {{chairman}} or {{a member of}} the steering committee of many large-scale international drug trials that have influenced treatment of cardiovascular disease. These include the <b>Carvedilol</b> Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) Trial, OPTIMAAL (angiotensin receptor antagonist in heart failure), and SENIORS (management of heart failure in the elderly).|$|E
50|$|A Beta-3 {{adrenergic}} antagonist (β3-adrenoceptor antagonist) is an adrenergic antagonist which {{blocks the}} Beta-3 adrenergic receptors of cells, with either high specificity (an antagonist which is selective for β3 adrenoceptors) like L-748,328, L-748,337 and SR 59,230A or non-specifically (an antagonist for β3 and for β1 or β2 adrenoceptors) like the non-selective betablocker <b>Carvedilol.</b>|$|E
50|$|Negative inotropic agents {{decrease}} myocardial contractility, and {{are used}} to decrease cardiac workload in conditions such as angina. While negative inotropism may precipitate or exacerbate heart failure, certain beta blockers (e.g. <b>carvedilol,</b> bisoprolol and metoprolol) have been believed to reduce morbidity and mortality in congestive heart failure. Quite recently, however, the effectiveness of beta blockers has come under renewed critical scientific scrutiny.|$|E
50|$|He {{has contributed}} {{to a number of}} {{clinical}} trials, including the first trials of <b>Carvedilol,</b> in heart failure and acute myocardial infarction; the first clinical trial of 7E3 (and its chimeric form), in patients with coronary artery disease; the first clinical trial of Ranolazine in stable angina. He also developed TC-99m tetrofosmin (Myoview) for myocardial perfusion imaging in man in conjunction with Amersham International (now GE).|$|E
50|$|<b>Carvedilol</b> is {{indicated}} {{in the management of}} congestive heart failure (CHF), commonly as an adjunct to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors) and diuretics. It has been clinically shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations in people with CHF. The mechanism behind its positive effect when used long-term in clinically stable CHF patients is not fully understood, but is thought to contribute to remodeling of the heart, improving upon its structure and function.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carvedilol</b> {{is about}} 25% to 35% {{bioavailable}} following oral administration due to extensive first-pass metabolism. The compound is metabolized by liver enzymes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 via aromatic ring oxidation and glucuronidation, then further conjugated by glucuronidation and sulfation. Compared with the parent compound, the three active metabolites exhibits only one-tenth of the vasodilating {{effect of the}} parent compound. However, the 4’hydroxyphenyl metabolite is about 13-fold more potent in ß-blockade than the parent compound.|$|E
50|$|In {{one study}} after 10 weeks of {{treatment}} with an ARB called losartan (Cozaar), 88% of hypertensive males with sexual dysfunction reported improvement {{in at least}} one area of sexuality, and overall sexual satisfaction improved from 7.3% to 58.5%. In a study comparing beta-blocker <b>carvedilol</b> with valsartan, the angiotensin II receptor blocker not only had no deleterious effect on sexual function, but actually improved it. Other ARBs include candesartan (Atacand), telmisartan (Micardis), and Valsartan (Diovan), fimasartan (Kanarb).|$|E

50|$|Hydralazine is {{not used}} as a primary drug for {{treating}} hypertension because it elicits a reflex sympathetic stimulation of the heart (the baroreceptor reflex). The sympathetic stimulation may increase heart rate and cardiac output, and in people with coronary artery disease may cause angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. Hydralazine may also increase plasma renin concentration, resulting in fluid retention. To prevent these undesirable side effects, hydralazine is usually prescribed in combination with a β-blocker (e.g., propranolol) and a diuretic. Beta-blockers licensed to treat heart failure in the UK include bisoprolol, <b>carvedilol,</b> and nebivolol.|$|E
