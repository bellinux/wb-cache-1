5|$|In {{addition}} to its use in folk medicine, P.atriplicifolia is sometimes used in Russia to flavor a vodka-based cocktail. Its flowers are eaten in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, including Kashmir, adding a sweet flavor to salads; {{they can also be}} crushed to yield a blue <b>colorant</b> that can be employed in cosmetics or as a textile dye. This species is considered a candidate for use in phytoremediation because of its rapid growth, tolerance for harsh conditions, and ability to accumulate toxic heavy metals from polluted soil.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had {{developed}} a glassy material known as faience, which they treated {{as a type of}} artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a <b>colorant,</b> typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials {{in the form of a}} paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} cheaper Mexican {{cochineal}} {{led to an}} abrupt slump in the Polish cochineal trade, and the 1540s saw a steep decline in quantities of the red dye exported from Poland. In 1547, Polish cochineal disappeared from the Poznań customs registry; a Volhynian clerk noted in 1566 that the dye no longer paid in Gdańsk. Perennial knawel plantations were replaced with cereal fields or pastures for raising cattle. Polish cochineal, which until then was mostly an export product, continued to be used locally by the peasants who collected it; it was employed not only for dyeing fabric {{but also as a}} vodka <b>colorant,</b> an ingredient in folk medicine, or even for decorative coloring of horses' tails.|$|E

Acquisition of <b>colorants</b> by extraction techniques is shown in several representatives of natural <b>colorants.</b> The thesis also contains some most frequently used analytical methods (UV/VIS spectrometry, chromatography, electrophoresis and polarography), which are used for detection and determination of food <b>colorants.</b> Terms of coloring foodstuffs are defined by the applicable laws of the Czech Republic and the European Union, which are also part of this work...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has been}} {{initiated}} {{to determine a}} set of six basis <b>colorants</b> which are the best representation of artwork such as paintings. That is, their spectral information can be accurately reconstructed by linear combinations of the six estimated <b>colorants.</b> Since each painting is possibly created by different <b>colorants,</b> the six estimated <b>colorants</b> are image dependent. The clue leading to the six estimated <b>colorants</b> is the six eigenvectors determined from the corresponding spectral measurements. The relationship between the six eigenvectors and estimated <b>colorants</b> is merely the linear transformation (or geometrical rotation). Based on this faith, a constrained-rotation engine using MATLAB was devised to perform the transformation from the eigenvectors {{to a set of}} all-positive vectors as the estimated <b>colorants.</b> Once a set of reasonable <b>colorants</b> is uncovered, this set of <b>colorants</b> can be used to synthesize the original artwork with the least metameric effect between the reproductions and originals...|$|R

5|$|Many {{contemporary}} uses {{of uranium}} exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 {{is the only}} naturally occurring fissile isotope, which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 {{and to a lesser}} degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating. Uranium is used as a <b>colorant</b> in uranium glass, producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early photography.|$|E

It causes and will cause severe tension to the {{consumers}} as the sensitivity of people increases to general health. This work was carried out to study and compare between the possible toxic effect of some natural (tumeric, carmine and chlorophyll) and synthetic (fast green, annatto and sunset-yellow), food <b>colorants</b> on liver and kidney function of young male albino rats. Such effect might explain hyperactivity of children that was claimed associated with consumption of food <b>colorants.</b> The study revealed that administration of both natural and synthetic food <b>colorants</b> (permitted dose) significantly increases serum AST and serum urea.

Some of the <b>colorants</b> used have a retard destructive effect on some vital organ functions, which extends even after the recovery period. Therefore, large quantities and /or long periods of <b>colorants</b> administration should not be used as additive in man's diet or as a drink.

40|$|The {{colorfastness}} {{of several}} traditional Japanese <b>colorants</b> upon exposure to atmospheric ozone was {{tested in a}} chamber exposure experiment. Samples, {{in the form of}} <b>colorants</b> applied to paper, dyes on silk cloth, and <b>colorants</b> on a nineteenth- century Japanese woodblock print, were exposed to an atmosphere containing 0 • 40 parts per million ozone at 220 C and 50 % RH, in the absence of light, for 12 weeks. Color differences, calculated from the measured diffuse reflectance spectra, were used to assess the rate and extent of the ozone fading. Of the <b>colorants</b> applied to paper, orpiment was the only inorganic pigment that showed severe color loss after ozone exposure. Several organic <b>colorants</b> on paper also reacted, including the widely used plant <b>colorants</b> ɑi (indigo) and ukon (turmeric).

To this purpose the following variables: orbital stirring speed, pH, temperature, sucrose and yeast extract concentrations and incubation time were studied through two fractional factorial, one full factorial and a central composite factorial designs. The re-gression analysis pointed out that sucrose and yeast extract concentrations were the variables that in-fluenced more in <b>colorants</b> production. Under the best conditions (yeast extract concentration around 10 g/L and sucrose concentration of 50 g/L) an increase of 10, 33 and 23 % respectively to yellow, or-ange and red <b>colorants</b> absorbance was achieved.
