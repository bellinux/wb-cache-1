Modifications of poly(GMA-co-EGDMA) with various diamines (1, 2 -diaminoethane, 1, 4 -diaminobutane, 1, 6 -diaminohexane and 1, 8 -diaminooctane), 2 -fluoroethylamine, glutaraldehyde and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>chloride</b> were carried out. The {{influence of the}} interaction between Candida antarctica lipase B (Cal-B) and various carriers during immobilization on the loading and hydrolytic activity (hydrolysis of para-nitrophenyl acetate) of the immobilized Cal-B were studied. Immobilization of Cal-B was performed at different temperatures and pH values. Cal-B immobilized at 30 °C and pH 6. 8 was leading to increased activities. Purely physical adsorption between enzyme and copolymer was observed on carriers in which amine or fluorine groups were introduced into the carrier structure by modification with various diamines or 2 -fluoroethylamine. As a consequence enzyme loading and activity decreases. In contrary, modification of the poly(GMA-co-EGDMA) with glutaraldehyde and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>chloride</b> results in a covalent connection between enzyme and carrier. The obtained results show a significant increase in Cal-B activity. The influence of the amount of glutaraldehyde and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>chloride</b> used for modification was screened. Increasing the amount of glutaraldehyde or <b>cyanuric</b> <b>chloride</b> used for modification resulted in an increase of the enzyme loading. Consequently, higher amount of glutaraldehyde used led to a higher fraction of the enzyme molecules that are covalently connected on to the carrier. As the amount of glutaraldehyde or <b>cyanuric</b> <b>chloride</b> used for modifications increases, activity of immobilized C. antarctica lipase B primarily increases, showing the highest value for 0. 66 % and 0. 050 % w/w, respectively, and subsequently decreases.

In particular the site of the chemical coupling reaction between DMPA and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>chloride</b> is found to be located in homogeneous solution rather than proceeding via an interfacial process although the rate of the reaction is effectively controlled by the speed at which solid can enter the solution. © 1993 American Chemical Society...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) with {{molecular}} mass of 5 kDa activated with succinimidyl carbonate and <b>cyanuric</b> <b>chloride,</b> separately was covalently attached to human {{red blood cells}} (RBCs). Inhibition of agglutination by blood-type specific antisera (anti-D) was employed to evaluate {{the effect of the}} polymer coating. The remaining single cells after incubation with anti-D sera were counted using a simple hemocytometer (Improved Neubauer Ruling). The extent of surface coating was evaluated by addition of FITC labeled-anti-D to the cells and recording the fluorescence intensity ratio of FITC-anti-D bound cells of the PEG-RBCs versus control (uncoated) RBCs. The morphology of RBCs was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effect of polymer coating, based on the immunological response of RBCs, using two kinds of activated mPEG, at optimum conditions of PEGylation was compared. It was found that succinimidyl carbonate at its optimum condition (pH= 8. 7, temperature = 14 °C and reaction time = 60 min) is more effective than <b>cyanuric</b> <b>chloride</b> at its optimum condition (pH= 8. 7, temperature = 14 °C and reaction time = 30 min) for RBC coating with mPEG.
