40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} the programme work of eight Central European <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> in two West European capitals between 2000 and 2008 : the Hungarian, Polish, Slovak and Czech <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> in Paris and Berlin. In the 1990 s {{the principle of}} a foreign cultural policy itself, {{as well as its}} instruments, were fundamentally questioned in the four Visegrád states. These institutions also faced many critics, including in France and Germany. Nevertheless the Visegrád states have chosen to maintain the <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> they had in the French and German capitals and, if needed, to create some more. This {{raises the question of whether}} these institutions developed a long-term plan. The present study assumes that the special character and added value of national <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> abroad is based on the potential to promote dialogue between representatives of different cultures. The central question addressed in this paper is: to what extent do the <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> of the Visegrád states in Paris and Berlin intend to position themselves as a forum for intercultural dialogue at the beginning of the 21 st century? Firstly, this paper wants to make a contribution to a field of research – the <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> of the Visegrád states – which has not yet been the subject of much study. A thus far nonexistent analysis of the programme work of the eight <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> and their perception by the public between 2000 and 2008 is conducted. Secondly, this study aims to provide the <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> with impetus for the reflection on their future role in the European Union (EU). The analysis is based on comprehensive empirical material, which was collected for the purpose of this study. Before the programme work of the eight <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> between 2000 and 2008 is addressed, an overview of their history is presented. In order to answer the question of the dialogic approach of the analysed <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> at the beginning of the 21 th century, their objectives during the years 2006 and 2008, which are published by the Ministries and the institutes in the internet, are first analyzed. The analysis then focuses on the local implementation of the objectives. By means of an analysis of the programme work of the eight institutes between 2000 and 2008, it is examined thereafter, whether some elements that are beneficial to the intercultural dialogue are incorporated in practice. Using a survey of the audience, the impression of visitors regarding the <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> and how important the dialogic approach is with regard to the perception of the visitors is also investigated. The analysed <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> represent countries which have joined the EU in 2004. In this context, the attention was directed to the new member states. The final part of the analysis addresses the question, whether the examined <b>cultural</b> <b>institutes</b> have noticed and incorporated this new dynamic, in order to become part of the intercultural European dialogue...|$|R
