5|$|As {{the galactic}} plane passes through it, Serpens Cauda {{contains}} many massive OB stars. Several {{of these are}} {{visible to the naked}} eye, such as NW Serpentis, an early Be star that {{has been found to be}} somewhat variable. The variability is interesting; according to one study, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the first discovered hybrids between Beta Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars. Although not visible to the naked eye, HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of three very hot O-type stars. A member of the cluster NGC 6604, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type. Also an eclipsing binary, the HD 166734 system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each other. Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is HD 161701, a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B-type primary and an Ap secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of mercury and manganese and an Ap star.|$|E

25|$|Overall, the few Gladiators and CR.42s {{clashed with}} a {{substantial}} parity: considering all theaters, the kill ratio was 1.2-to-1 {{in favour of}} the former, a ratio {{similar to that of}} the BF.109 and the Spitfire in the Battle of Britain, a duel considered evenly balanced by most historians. However, the Gladiator (optimised for dogfighting) met with only little success against the relatively fast Italian bombers, shooting down only a handful of them and suffering almost as many losses in the process, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the reasons for its quick retirement from first-line duty; the CR.42 on the other hand was successful against early British bombers, shooting down a hundred of them with minimal losses.|$|E

Islamic scholars debated over creating Pakistan and its potential to become a true Islamic state The majority of Barelvis supported the creation of Pakistan and believed that any co-operation with Hindus would be counter productive. Most Deobandis, who were led by Maulana Husain Ahmad Madani, were opposed to the creation of Pakistan and the two-nation theory.

25|$|Dundas's most {{significant}} {{challenge of the}} battle was navigating both the Naiad and the crippled Belleisle through the rising storm {{to the safety of}} Gibraltar. By 22 October they had lost contact with {{most of the rest of}} the fleet, but Dundas persevered, several times having to haul the ships off the coast as strong winds threatened to drive them onshore. Better weather on the morning of 23 October allowed Dundas to make more sail, but the return of the gale in the afternoon placed both ships in difficulties. During the afternoon the crews had a fright when a ship-of-the-line was spotted speeding up from the south. At first it seemed that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> of the squadron that had escaped from Trafalgar under Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, but after an exchange of signals the mystery ship was revealed to be , rushing northwards to join the fleet. Naiad and Belleisle battled the weather for the rest of the day; several times the tow rope snapped, but it was reattached by the Naiad sailing close enough to the unmanageable hulk of the Belleisle for a rope to be thrown across, as the sea was too rough to risk launching boats. At 1940 that evening the two ships collided, damaging Naiads jolly boat and smashing away most of the starboard quarter gallery.|$|E
25|$|On Monday 28 December, {{the first}} day of the runoff campaign, the {{incumbent}} president Stjepan Mesić indicated that he supports Ivo Josipović to be his successor. He praised his manifesto and said Croatia needs a president working actively against corruption and for justice. He also insulted Milan Bandić saying it was impossible he only spent 3million kuna for the campaign saying he knows how much a campaign costs. He pleaded for more transparency and called on him to release the names of those who were really financing his campaign. Bandić responded by saying that Mesić hasn't released the names of his donors to this day and that he was a part of both of his campaigns so he knows how nontransparent they were. Mesić called Bandić a liar saying he was the only one in those days to release the name of every single person who contributed to his victory. He said his campaign reports were published, on Croatian, not English, clearly referring to the fact that Bandić couldn't speak proper English. He also suggested there <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> debate held entirely in English, mocking Bandić since he previously claimed he speaks the language. Bandić responded saying he would be glad to attend that debate only if Mesić was moderating it, referring to the fact that the president himself was also not an English speaker. He also called the president an 'old man' saying it was only natural he forgot about the help he provided him during his two campaigns.|$|E
