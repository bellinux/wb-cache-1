The semantic model vectors are extracted using a set of discriminative semantic classifiers, each being an ensemble of SVM models trained from thousands of labeled web images, for a total of 280 generic concepts. Our study reveals that the pro-posed semantic model vectors representation outperforms—and is complementary to—other low-level visual descriptors for video event modeling. We hence present an end-to-end video event detection system, which combines semantic model vectors with other static or dynamic visual descriptors, extracted at the frame, segment, or full <b>clip</b> <b>level.</b> We perform a comprehensive empir-ical study on the 2010 TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection tas...|$|E

The encoding reduces the pose information from an image to a single column, dramatically diminishing the input requirements for the network, but retaining the essential information for recognition. The encoding is applied to the task of recognizing and localizing signed gestures in British Sign Language (BSL) videos.

This paper proposes a high level semantic feature in a low dimensional space to represent the essential characteristic of different motion classes. On the basis of the statistic training of Gauss Mixture Model, this feature can effectively achieve motion matching on both global <b>clip</b> <b>level</b> and local frame level.

40|$|Estimation of the {{acoustic}} parameters Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Reverberation Time (T 60), Direct-to-Reverberant Ratio (DRR), and <b>clipping</b> <b>level</b> from degraded speech are open research questions. These parameters {{are important for}} determining speech quality and intelligibility, and they are widely applicable to speech enhancement and speech recognition systems. Whilst SNR, T 60, and DRR are useful priors for dereverberation schemes, indications of clipping and the <b>clipping</b> <b>level</b> are useful for signal restoration. This thesis investigates how accurately and robustly to noise and, {{in the case of}} clipping detection, robustness to the coding and decoding process it is possible to estimate these parameters non-intrusively from degraded speech in real-time or near real-time, and introduces a range of novel algorithms. Alongside the algorithms, an international research challenge was staged for which a novel noisy reverberant speech corpus was developed to determine the state-of-the-art in T 60 and DRR estimation. In tests, the algorithms presented in this thesis were highly competitive, being able to estimate T 60 with Pearson correlation coefficient, ρ = 0. 608 and DRR with ρ = 0. 314.

40|$|Abstract—In tone {{reservation}} (TR) based OFDM systems, {{the peak}} to average power ratio (PAPR) reduction performance mainly {{depends on the}} selection of the peak reduction tone (PRT) set and the optimal target <b>clipping</b> <b>level.</b> Finding the optimal PRT set requires an exhaustive search of all combinations of possible PRT sets, which is a nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP-hard) problem, and this search is infeasible for the number of tones used in practical systems. The existing selection methods, such as the consecutive PRT set, equally spaced PRT set and random PRT set, perform poorly compared to the optimal PRT set or incur high computational complexity. In this paper, an efficient scheme based on genetic algorithm (GA) with lower computational complexity is proposed for searching a nearly optimal PRT set. While TR-based clipping is simple and attractive for practical implementation, de-termining the optimal target <b>clipping</b> <b>level</b> is difficult. To overcome this problem, we propose an adaptive clipping control algorithm.

Timestamp: 00 : 12 - 00 : 36. Clipping is an unpleasant recording artifact that occurs when an audio signal’s level rises above a microphone’s or AD converter’s maximum input level. As more audio and video recordings are being taken on mobile devices (sometimes in high sound level conditions such as live concerts), clipping has become an issue that users encounter frequently. We present ClipAway: a web application that analyzes an audio file and automatically removes clipping from the audio file. The following scenario illustrates the service we supply: 1) A user attends a live concert and creates an audio recording of the concert. 2) The user listens to the recording at home and notices clipping, which causes the listening experience to be unsatisfactory. 3) The user uploads the audio recording to the ClipAway website. 4) Audio processing occurs in the browser, and the user then exports a qualityenhanced version of the recording. 5) The listening experience with the resulting audio file has significantly improved. The advantage of browser-based processing is that it is more familiar and accessible to most users than a native solution, which would likely require the user to install a standalone software or a digital audio workstation hosting a plugin for quality enhancement. The declipping algorithm is split into two sections: clipping detection and clipping correction. Clipping detection involves the automatic estimation of the <b>clipping</b> <b>level</b> and the subsequent localization of clipped regions. The <b>clipping</b> <b>level</b> is determined by identifying anomalies in the signal’s amplitude histogram near the positive and negative endpoints. The locations of clipping are determined by identifying samples with amplitudes close to the <b>clipping</b> <b>level</b> where the signal has a near-horizontal slope. Clipping correction involves replacing short clipped regions using spline interpolation and replacing long clipped regions through linear interpolation of time-frequency bin magnitudes...|$|R

The steered captioning model is the first attention model to smartly guide an attention model to appropriate locations in a video by using visual attributes. The Multi-stream Hierarchical Boundary model combines a fixed hierarchy recurrent architecture with a soft hierarchy layer by using intrinsic feature boundary cuts within a video to define clips. This thesis also introduces a novel parametric Gaussian attention which removes the restriction of soft attention techniques which require fixed length video streams. By carefully incorporating Gaussian attention in designated layers, the proposed models demonstrate state-of-the-art video captioning results on recent datasets...|$|E

40|$|Event {{retrieval}} {{and recognition}} {{in a large}} corpus of videos necessitates a holistic fixed-size visual representation at the video <b>clip</b> <b>level</b> that is comprehensive, compact, and yet discriminative. It shall comprehensively aggregate information across relevant video frames, while suppress redundant information, leading to a compact representation that can effectively differentiate among different visual events. In search for such a representation, we propose to build a spatially consistent counting grid model to aggregate together deep features extracted from different video frames. The spatial consistency of the counting grid model is achieved by introducing a prior model estimated from a large corpus of video data. The counting grid model produces an intermediate tensor representation for each video, which automatically identifies and removes the feature redundancy across the different frames. The tensor representation is subsequently reduced to a fixed-size vector representation by averaging over the counting grid. When compared to existing methods on both event retrieval and event classification benchmarks, we achieve significantly better accuracy with much more compact representation.

The complexity of each algorithm is compared in terms of hardware operations. One solution is a variation of a recent Lucent patent called vector subtraction that avoids the division in the scaling operation for a minor reduction in the SNR (< 0. 5 dB for 3 iterations).
