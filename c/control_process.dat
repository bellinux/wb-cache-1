This two-disc edition was also included in a box set titled World War II Collection, along with two documentaries produced by Spielberg, Price For Peace (about the Pacific War) and Shooting War (about war photographers, narrated by Tom Hanks). The film was released on Blu-ray Disc on April 26, 2010 in the UK and on May 4, 2010 in the US, as part of Paramount Home Video's premium Sapphire Series. However, only weeks after its release, Paramount issued a recall due to audio synchronization problems.

40|$|Cognitive <b>control</b> <b>processes,</b> such {{as those}} {{involved}} in response inhibition or task switching, have {{been the focus of}} much recent research. Few studies, however, have considered how such processes work together in tasks that require multiple <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> This paper reports a computational study of random sequence generation and the cognitive <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> involved therein. The task, which is argued to involve multiple <b>control</b> <b>processes,</b> produces several dependent measures. These measures are held to be differentially dependent on the differential efficacy of the various underlying <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> Initial simulations demonstrate that the model is capable of reproducing subject performance on the basic task. Additional simulations explore differential interference effects of different secondary tasks (held to interfere with different <b>control</b> <b>processes)</b> on the different random generation dependent measures. The work illustrates how the putative <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> may interact in the production of successive responses during the random generation task...|$|R
40|$|Generally, {{so-called}} <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> {{are thought}} to be necessary when we must perform one out of several competing actions. Some examples include performance of a less well-practiced action instead of a well-practiced one (prepotency); learning a new action (novelty); and rapidly switching from one action to another (task-switching). While it certainly is difficult to perform the desired action in these circumstances, it is less clear that a separate set of <b>processes</b> (e. g., <b>control</b> <b>processes)</b> are necessary to explain the observed behavior. Another way to approach the study of <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> is to investigate physiological dependent measures (e. g., electrophysiological or neuroimaging measures). Although these offer another avenue of inquiry into <b>control</b> <b>processes,</b> they have yet to furnish unambiguous evidence that <b>control</b> <b>processes</b> exist. While this might suggest that there are no <b>control</b> <b>processes,</b> {{it is also possible that}} our methods are insufficiently sensitive to measure <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> We have investigated this latter possibility using tasks that are neuroanatomically distinct, though within the same modality (vision). This approach did not yield evidence for a separable set of <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> However, recent works using a task-switching paradigm in which subjects switch between a visual and an auditory task suggest that switching both task and modality may be importantly different than switching task within a given modality. This may represent a way forward in the study of <b>control</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R
