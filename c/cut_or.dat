Due to the subject matter and length of the episode, several scenes had to be <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> trimmed for time, since so much was being placed in the episode. A review by Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club was complimentary towards the story, and Sava also applauded Dunham's voice-acting.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} plant, {{meaning that}} it is resilient to cold and freezing climatic conditions, dies back {{at the end of}} its growing season, has creeping rootstalks, and lives for over two years. It grows vigorously from seed over a period of 2–5 years, and thrives particularly well in freshly disturbed, <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> eroded peat. E.angustifolium is protogynous.|$|E

5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in the cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
5|$|Industrial use of {{diamonds}} {{has historically been}} associated with their hardness, which makes diamond the ideal material for cutting and grinding tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, <b>cut,</b> <b>or</b> wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common industrial applications of this property include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. Less expensive industrial-grade diamonds, known as bort, with more flaws and poorer color than gems, are used for such purposes. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E

A 2007 study of the north tower's collapse published by researchers of Purdue University determined that, since the plane's impact had stripped off much of the structure's thermal insulation, the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless {{of the number of}} columns <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> damaged by the impact.|$|E

5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit. Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending <b>cuts</b> <b>or</b> borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|R
5|$|Ostrom {{suggested}} that Deinonychus could kick with the sickle claw {{to cut and}} slash at its prey. Some researchers even {{suggested that}} the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. Other {{studies have suggested that}} the sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs to the victim. In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} recordings of the different versions, especially of the Berlioz adaptation featuring a female Orfeo. The British contralto Kathleen Ferrier and American mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne were especially notable interpreters. In recent years, recordings and stage productions of the Vienna version of the opera have featured countertenors {{in the role of}} Orpheus. Countertenors Derek Lee Ragin, Jochen Kowalski, René Jacobs, James Bowman, and Michael Chance have recorded Orfeo ed Euridice. The role of Orfeo has also been performed and recorded by tenors and even baritones such as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, who has made three recordings of the role. Until recent times, most recordings of all versions were <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> altered in some way.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E

5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the rates of self-harm are much higher among young people with the average age of onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young people could be as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E

Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
5|$|The ice trade {{began in}} 1806 {{as the result}} of the efforts of Frederic Tudor, a New England entrepreneur, to export ice on a {{commercial}} basis. In New England, ice was an expensive product, consumed only by the wealthy who could afford their own ice houses. Nonetheless, icehouses were relatively common amongst the wealthier members of society by 1800, filled with ice <b>cut,</b> <b>or</b> harvested, from the frozen surface of ponds and streams on their local estates during the winter months. Around the neighbouring New York City area, the hot summers and rapidly growing economy had begun to increase local demand for ice towards the end of the 18th century, creating a small-scale market amongst farmers who sold ice from their ponds and streams to local city institutions and families. Some ships occasionally transported ice from New York and Philadelphia for sale to the southern U.S. states, in particular Charleston in South Carolina, laying it down as ballast on the trip.|$|E

5|$|The subalpine waxy cap (Hygrophorus subalpinus) is {{somewhat}} similar in appearance to R.brevipes but lacks its brittle flesh, {{and it has}} a sticky, glutinous cap. The Pacific Northwest species Russula cascadensis also resembles R.brevipes, but has an acrid taste and smaller fruit bodies. Another lookalike, R.vesicatoria, has gills that often fork near the stipe attachment. R.angustispora is quite similar to R.brevipes, but has narrower spores measuring 6.5–8.5 by 4.5–5µm, and it does not have the pale greenish band that sometimes develops in the latter species. The European look-alike R.delica is widely distributed, although rarer in the northern regions of the continent. Similar to R.brevipes in overall morphology, it has somewhat larger spores (9–12 by 7–8.5µm) with a surface ornamentation featuring prominent warts interconnected by a zebra-like patterns of ridges. The milk-cap mushroom Lactifluus piperatus can be distinguished from R.brevipes by the production of latex when the mushroom tissue is <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> injured.|$|E
5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.|$|E
5|$|Stelae {{have become}} {{threatened}} {{in modern times}} by plundering for sale on the international art market. Many stelae are found in remote areas and their size and weight prevents them from being removed intact. Various methods are used to <b>cut</b> <b>or</b> break a stela for easier transport, including power saws, chisels, acid and heat. When a monument is well preserved, the looters attempt to cut off its face for transport. Even when successful, this results in damage to inscriptions {{on the sides of}} the stela. At worst, this method results in complete fragmentation of the stela face with any recoverable sculpture removed for sale. Traceable fragments of well known monuments have been purchased by American museums and private collectors in the past. When such monuments are removed from their original context, their historical meaning is lost. Although museums have justified their acquisition of stelae fragments with the argument that such objects are better preserved in an institution, no stela has been sold in as good a condition as it was in its original location. After 1970 there was a sharp drop in Maya stelae available on the New York art market due to the ratification of a treaty with Mexico that guarantees the return of stolen pre-Columbian sculpture that was removed from the country after the ratification date. In the early 1970s some museums, such as that of the University of Pennsylvania, responded to international criticism by no longer purchasing archaeological artefacts that lack a legally documented history, including place of origin, previous owners and an export license. Harvard University also instituted a similar policy in the early 1970s.|$|E
