Andy vehemently protests the breakup and says their {{relationship}} <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> if she just pretends to still love him. Erin walks outside to Pete, saying she could not do it. Pete tells her he is okay with this, since all he wants is for her to be happy. Emboldened by this, she gives him a kiss, runs back up to Andy's office, and breaks up with him. In her brief breakup speech she repeats her complaints about his three-month absence, not realizing that he is talking to David Wallace on speakerphone.|$|E

500|$|By [...] "All the Madame's Men", McCown-Levy {{felt that}} Agents of Hydra was [...] "the most {{consistently}} entertaining arc the series has ever done. The show has had higher highs, but never this constant {{a level of}} quality. I've argued several times of late that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has been getting steadily better each season, and even in a year that had strong arcs like Ghost Rider and LMD, this final storyline tops them all ... the show has essentially managed to create an alternate reality where it <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> longstanding issues and address unfinished character beats, all while smartly delivering action and thrills ... And insofar as this keeps working, it's managed to turn the TV equivalent of a fun B-movie into a superior television show." [...] Overall, Schwartz awarded the season an 8.8 out of 10, stating the season was [...] "the best [...] ever been, maturing as a show and learning the right lessons from what's come before." [...] She praised the pod format, saying it [...] "helped tighten the season {{and give it a}} stronger throughline" [...] and added that each new pod the season introduced was more successful than the previous, with the Agents of Hydra pod and Framework story arc possibly the strongest of the entire series. Schwartz also spoke fondly of the guest stars throughout the season, particularly Jansen, who she called [...] "the season's MVP" [...] and felt [...] "stole the show" [...] with Aida, who was [...] "the standout new character" [...] of the season. Some negatives on the season were the additional villains, Eli Morrow and the Superior (not [...] "a particularly standout villain", and never [...] "as imposing or terrifying as he should have been", respectively), and some of the early effects work, though she also praised [...] "the great CGI work" [...] with Ghost Rider. Den of Geeks Rob Leane also praised the pod format, saying it [...] "fixed the 22-episode problem". He felt the Ghost Rider pod had amazing visual effects, and was a [...] "natural" [...] length that other series may have stretched further. He also highlighted Wen's performance as LMD May in the LMD pod and the Agents of Hydra pod's Mack and Hope storyline, and praised the guest performances of Luna and Jansen (feeling that bringing the latter two together in the finale [...] "was the perfect way to wrap things up"). Leane called the season [...] "a master class in how Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. can thrive going forward ... the writers keep throwing in more sci-fi concepts, the special effects team keep delivering, and the cast keep stepping up their game to keep up with it all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy is}} most closely {{allied with the}} scientist–practitioner model in which clinical practice and research is informed by a scientific perspective, clear operationalization of the problem, and an emphasis on measurement, including measuring changes in cognition and behavior and in the attainment of goals. These are often met through [...] "homework" [...] assignments in which {{the patient and the}} therapist work together to craft an assignment to complete before the next session. The completion of these assignments– which {{can be as simple as}} a person suffering from depression attending some kind of social event– indicates a dedication to treatment compliance and a desire to change. The therapists can then logically gauge the next step of treatment based on how thoroughly the patient completes the assignment. Effective cognitive behavioral therapy is dependent on a therapeutic alliance between the healthcare practitioner and the person seeking assistance. Unlike many other forms of psychotherapy, the patient is very involved in CBT. For example, an anxious patient may be asked to talk to a stranger as a homework assignment, but if that is too difficult, he or she <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> an easier assignment first. The therapist needs to be flexible and willing to listen to the patient rather than acting as an authority figure.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Joe Klein of Time magazine in October 2008, Barack Obama expressed his intention {{to try to work}} with India and Pakistan to resolve the crisis. He said he had talked to Bill Clinton about it, as Clinton has experience as a mediator. In an editorial in The Washington Times, Selig S Harrison, director of the Asia Programme at the Center for International Policy and a senior scholar of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars called it Obama's first foreign policy mistake. In an editorial, The Australian called Obama's idea to appoint a presidential negotiator [...] "a very stupid and dangerous move indeed". In an editorial in Forbes, Reihan Salam, associate editor for The Atlantic, noted [...] "The smartest thing President Obama could do on Kashmir is probably nothing. We have to hope that India and Pakistan <b>can</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> their differences on Kashmir on their own". The Boston Globe called the idea of appointing Bill Clinton as an envoy to Kashmir [...] "a mistake". President Obama subsequently appointed Richard Holbrooke as special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan. President Asif Ali Zardari hoped that Holbrooke would help mediate to resolve the Kashmir issue. Kashmir was later removed from Holbrooke's mandate. [...] "Eliminating ... Kashmir from his job description ... is seen as a significant diplomatic concession to India that reflects increasingly warm ties between the country and the United States," [...] The Washington Post noted in a report. Brajesh Mishra, India's former national security adviser, was quoted in the same report as saying that [...] "No matter what government is in place, India is not going to relinquish control of Jammu and Kashmir". [...] "That is written in stone and cannot be changed." [...] According to The Financial Times, India has warned Obama that he risks [...] "barking up the wrong tree" [...] if he seeks to broker a settlement between Pakistan and India over Kashmir.|$|E
