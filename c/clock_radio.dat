2500|$|Emerson Radio {{pioneered the}} Smartset <b>clock</b> <b>radio</b> which {{automatically}} sets {{itself with the}} correct time and date using the WWV atomic clock time signal to accurately set the clock's time when the alarm clock is powered-on and after a power outage.

2500|$|On February 2, Phil awakens at his Punxsutawney bed {{and breakfast}} to Sonny & Cher's [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] on the <b>clock</b> <b>radio</b> and the declaration, [...] "It's Groundhog Day!" [...] He tapes a half-hearted report on Punxsutawney Phil and the town's festivities. Rita wants to stay and cover {{some of the other}} events, but Phil wants to return to Pittsburgh immediately. The blizzard—the one that Phil {{predicted}} would miss the area—resolves the issue by blanketing the region in snow, stranding them in Punxsutawney. Phil shuns the celebrations and retires to bed early.|$|E

50|$|<b>Clock</b> <b>radios</b> are {{powered by}} AC {{power from the}} wall socket. In {{the event of a}} power interruption, older {{electronic}} digital models used to reset the time to midnight (00:00) and lose alarm settings. This would cause failure to trigger the alarm even if the power is restored. To solve this issue, they trigger the alarm at 00:01 after a reset, so that at least the user is able to correct the clock and alarm settings. Most of the recent <b>clock</b> <b>radios</b> use a battery backup to maintain the time and alarm settings. Some advanced <b>radio</b> <b>clocks</b> (not to be confused with <b>clocks</b> with AM/FM <b>radios)</b> have a feature which sets the time automatically using signals from atomic clock-synced time signal radio stations such as WWV, making the clock accurate and immune to time reset due to power interruptions.|$|R

5000|$|He does. Adam {{takes his}} sister {{to the mall}} {{on the day he}} puts his plan into action. Pushing her in her {{stroller}} through the aisles of the electronics store, he quickly pilfers a <b>clock</b> <b>radio</b> while no one is watching. He leaves the store without incident. It is no ordinary <b>clock</b> <b>radio,</b> however, at least by 1983 standards. Rather than waking a sleeper with the radio or an alarm pulse, this particular model will play an audio cassette at the designated time of alarm. This is central to his plan, which includes returning the <b>clock</b> <b>radio</b> to the store after setting it to play a prerecorded message the next day. He spends his remaining time at the mall asking passers-by to read one word each into a portable tape recorder he has borrowed from his father. In total, the message reads: [...] "Beware, you will be hurt if you do not do as I say. Go to the bathroom and lock the door." [...] After recording this message, he places the tape into the <b>clock</b> <b>radio</b> and then returns to the electronics store. He explains to Vanessa, the sales clerk, that his sister inadvertently placed the <b>clock</b> <b>radio</b> in the stroller and he did not notice it at the time. Vanessa is overjoyed, as she had feared that the missing <b>clock</b> <b>radio</b> would be deducted from her paycheck. Adam now believes that he is the last person that anyone would suspect of being a thief, as he returned an item when he could have simply kept it.|$|E

50|$|While {{the input}} signal to an audio power amplifier, {{such as the}} signal from an {{electric}} guitar, may measure {{only a few hundred}} microwatts, its output may be a few watts for small consumer electronics devices, such as <b>clock</b> <b>radios,</b> tens or hundreds of watts for a home stereo system, several thousand watts for a nightclub's sound system or tens of thousands of watts for a large rock concert sound reinforcement system. While power amplifiers are available in standalone units, typically aimed at the hi-fi audiophile market (a niche market) of audio enthusiasts and sound reinforcement system professionals, most consumer electronics sound products, such as <b>clock</b> <b>radios,</b> boom boxes and televisions have relatively small power amplifiers that are integrated inside the chassis of the main product.|$|R
