5000|$|Very {{early in}} his career, McSavaney {{determined}} to master the 'craft of photography' in order to adequately express his vision of what his mental photograph should represent. Applying and sometimes extending Ansel's teachings in making an [...] "expressive print", Ray honed and matured his artistic seeing and technical skills in two especially striking Los Angeles locations. One was the abandoned Uniroyal Tire Factory alongside a then busy highway, now a much busier Los Angeles freeway; [...] the other a major construction project in the city center, known as Bunker Hill, Los Angeles Redevelopment.In working on those unusually <b>contrasty</b> scenes, McSavaney soon discovered that his photographic skills were grossly inadequate. He was challenged by the technical pitfalls presented by scenes with extreme luminance ranges. Adams had discussed in detail just such pitfalls in his book on the Camera. With all that in mind in preparation for those difficult projects, McSavaney thoroughly experimented with several of Adams’ techniques for developing film exposed under extreme tonal ranges and lighting conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{character}} {{known as}} Bolt initially {{started out as}} a red, bipedal dog named Henry as designed by Chris Sanders. He, in difference to Bolt, would be {{aware of the fact that}} he is an actor. Henry, as well as Sander’s idea for the movie, was eventually scrapped when John Lasseter and some colleagues from Pixar reviewed the project. The character was subsequently redesigned and made into a White German Shepherd, although changes were done to the muzzle, ears and overall body-structure to give the character a more distinctive and expressive appearance. To make Bolt's movement seem more realistic and in-line with that of real canines, the animation department studied the body language and locomotion of real white shepherds and utilized virtual bone-structure in the CGI-models.Personality-wise, the new Bolt would be more naïve and insecure conveying more pathos than Henry. At the same time, the art department worked to give Bolt a whimsical nature with a pose which excels confidence, thus allowing the character to have a <b>contrasty</b> personality and a body language which reflects that.|$|E

[...] Robin Muir has summed up his legacy: [...] "His portraits still look starkly modern, half a century on. His street photographs are haunting documents too, a singular vision of three great cities. After two major retrospectives in London institutions, the Victoria & Albert Museum (1984) and the National Portrait Gallery (1996), and an entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, his place in the pantheon of twentieth century British photographers might be secured."

50|$|A newer form of {{a hybrid}} system is the {{combination}} of passive phase-detection auto-focus and passive contrast auto-focus, sometimes assisted by active methods, as both methods need some visible contrast to work with. Under their operational conditions, phase-detection auto-focusing is very fast, since the measurement method provides both information, the amount of offset and the direction, so that the focusing motor can move the lens right into (or close to) focus without additional measurements. Additional measurements on the fly, however, can improve accuracy or help keep track of moving objects. However, the accuracy of phase-detection auto-focus depends on its effective measurement basis. If the measurement basis is large, measurements are very accurate, but can only work with lenses with a large geometrical aperture (e.g. 1:2.8 or larger). Even with high <b>contrasty</b> objects, phase-detection AF cannot work at all with lenses slower than its effective measurement basis. In order to work with most lenses, the effective measurement basis is typically set to between 1:5.6 and 1:6.7, so that AF continues to work with slow lenses (at least {{for as long as}} they are not stopped down). This, however, reduces the intrinsical accuracy of the autofocus system, even if fast lenses are used. Since the effective measurement basis is an optical property of the actual implementation, it cannot be changed easily. Very few cameras provide multi-PD-AF systems with several switchable measurement bases depending on the lens used in order to allow normal auto-focusing with most lenses, and more accurate focusing with fast lenses.Contrast AF does not have this inherit design limitation on accuracy as it only needs a minimal object contrast to work with. Once this is available, it can work with high accuracy regardless of the speed of a lens; in fact, for as long as this condition is met, it can even work with the lens stopped down. Also, since contrast AF continues to work in stopped-down mode rather than only in open-aperture mode, it is immune to aperture-based focus shift errors phase-detection AF systems suffer since they cannot work in stopped-down mode. Thereby, contrast AF makes arbitrary fine-focus adjustments by the user unnecessary. Also, contrast AF is immune to focusing errors due to surfaces with repeating patterns and they can work over the whole frame, not just near the center of the frame, as phase-detection AF does. The down-side, however, is that contrast AF is a closed-loop iterative process of shifting the focus back and forth in rapid succession. Compared to phase-detection AF, contrast AF is slow, since the speed of the focus iteration process is mechanically limited and this measurement method does not provide any directional information. Combining both measurement methods, the phase-detection AF can assist a contrast AF system to be fast and accurate at the same time, to compensate aperture-based focus-shift errors, and to continue to work with lenses stopped down, as, for example, in stopped-down measuring or video mode.|$|E

40|$|Color {{photographs}} of a geometrically thin relativistic accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole are obtained and displayed. Photographs in optical and X-ray wavelengths {{as well as}} a bolometirc picture are also obtained and compared with one another. When the temperature at the inner region of the disk is some K, the X-ray and bolometric images are rather <b>contrasty,</b> while the brightness of the disk in the optical image gradually decreases from the inner region toward the fringe. X-ray light curves when the relativistic accretion disk is eclipsed by its companion are calculated. It is demonstrated that light curves exhibit asymmetric profiles due to the relativistic Doppler effect by the disk rotation. This light curve asymmetry inherent in the relativistic disk provides an alternative strategy to search for and detect the accretion disk around a compact object. Such an observation will verify the disk model and bring the space-time information near the compact object...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to verify the distribution of the tree and shrubs species along the soil humiditygradient in the punctual headwaters environment localized at the Santa Cruz stream watershed, Lavras, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. To understanding the vegetation it was performed a structural survey of shrubs and trees stratum of three degraded and disturbedheadwaters. In each sampled headwaters it was instaled 4 plots of 50 x 10 m located above (P 1), below (P 2), on the right (P 3) and onthe left (P 4) of the headwaters. The area around of the headwaters was separated in two gradients of species. The first gradientconsisted in species present in the plot P 2, following the river bed and in the firsts 10 m length of the plots P 1, P 3 and P 4. The secondgradient comprised of species present in the plots P 1, P 3 and P 4 from of the 10 m length of each plot.

40|$|Dedicated to Professor H. Boschma on the {{occasion}} of his seventieth birthday. INTRODUCTION The family Burhinidae or Stone Curlews, consists of large ploverlike birds which have no hind toe, long yellow legs with thickened tibiotarsal joints, hence the sometimes used popular name of "thickknee". The head is relatively big and very round and the eye is yellow, large and very striking. The bill is short and stout. The plumage is very cryptic when the bird is at rest, but in flight or in postures with wings raised a rather striking <b>contrasty</b> pattern becomes visible in the wing. All members of this family are nocturnal in their habits and during the day time they often squat on the ground among rocks and vegetation and are then difficult to spot unless they move. Stone Curlews are mostly found in tropical and temperate regions and they are represented by two species on the African continent. These two species are Burhinus vermiculatus (Cabanis) and B. capensis (Lichtenstein). The main difference between these two species is the fact that B. vermiculatus has a distinct pale bar bordered by a somewhat darker area on the inward edge, on each of the wings. B. capensis lacks this bar. The European species B. oedicnemus (L.) is very similar to B. vermiculatus and also has the bar. Of the two African species B. vermiculatus is never found far from water, hence its South African name of Water Dikkop. B. capensis, popularly called the Cape Dikkop, occurs in dry situations. Little to nothing is known about the behaviour of the former and we are only slightly better informed about the behaviour of the latter...|$|E
40|$|Autoradiographic image {{intensification}} {{methods for}} recovering {{the images of}} underexposed step wedges, resolution targets and radiographs were investigated. The fog level of the intensified image was decreased by treating the film in a subproportional photographic reducer (mixture of potassium ferricyanide and sodium thiosulfate) prior to activation with S- 35 thiourea. The fog level of intensified images of a step wedge decreased from a density of 1. 32 to. 12, the maximum contrast increased from 2. 08 to 5. 52, the relative speed increase calculated at 0. 6 above fog level increased from 3. 05 to 4. 06 while resolution remained the same at 5. 0 lines per millimeter. Radiographs of underexposed images were recovered by using this autoradiographic image intensification method. The underexposed radiograph {{was developed in the}} conventional manner using the Kodak X-Omat processor and treated in the subproportional photographic reducer to lower the fog density. The silver image of the underexposed radiograph was made radioactive with a solution of sulfur- 35 thiourea, air-dried and exposed to another emulsion. The intensified image was also developed in the conventional manner. Its diagnostic usefulness was judged by experienced radiologists as optimal, adequate, poor but diagnostic, or totally unacceptable in comparison to optimally exposed radiographs. Of the six underexposed radiographs involving various body regions studied following intensification, five were consistently rated adequate. This technique, when fully developed and applied will result in reduced radiation dose to patients undergoing radiologic examinations. A significant difference exists between the intensified image of a double-coated and single-coated emulsion. When both emulsions are treated in a subproportional reducer prior to activation with S- 35 thiourea, the intensified image obtained from a single-coated emulsion has less base plus fog density, higher gamma, and is more <b>contrasty</b> than that of a double-coated emulsion. These results indicate that to make deliberate underexposures, it is better to use a singlecoated than a double-coated emulsion...|$|E
40|$|Mould {{and blue}} stain attacks {{has become a}} growing problem in the {{construction}} industry. These attacks cause problems of various kinds. If it occurs indoors, it may cause health problems and in cases where mould is outside and fully visible problems become mainly of aesthetic nature. This thesis {{is a part of}} a TCN-project (Mould growth on sapwood boards exposed outdoors: Impact of drying process) which was conducted in 2009 at LTU Skellefteå and SP Trätek. One of the goals of the TCN-project was to reduce mould risk of tongued and grooved boards by temperature treatment. This thesis is a part of that work. The thesis consists of two parts: A. Determine whether heat pressing on the flat sides of unplaned lateral exchange of spruce has any effect on mould susceptibility. Is it possible to make the sugars at the surface and the surface itself less attractive to fungi by contact heating? The work contains the following main elements: § Scanning of wood surfaces with line camera before and after mould test § Heating experiments in veneer press § Mould test in climate chamber § Visual assessment of mould growth with self-made grading system B. Evaluation of the software MouldAnalyser 1. 0. The purpose of the program is to determine percentage of mould growth in scanned RGB images of infested wood surfaces. The wood used in conducted experiments was 22 x 100 mm boards of spruce. The test material consisted of five 30 cm long specimens per group (= 10 surfaces) and nine references (untreated). Three temperatures and three treatment times were selected for the heat pressing. Temperatures: 140 °C, 170 °C and 200 °C Times: 1 min, 3 min and 10 min A total of 9 groups (3 times x 3 temperatures) The mould test lasted for eight weeks in a climate chamber with a relative humidity of 95 % and a temperature of 22 °C. The evaluation of the mould growth was made with a four-point mould scale. Conclusions A. It is possible to make wood surfaces less attractive to mould by contact heating. All three press temperatures and two out of three (3 min and 10 min) press times resulted in significantly lower mean mould growth than the reference group. (All significant differences are at significance level 0, 05). B.
