6000|$|The {{outrigger}} launch {{referred to}} was a goodly-sized boat, {{fitted with a}} small engine and screw propeller. Its chief peculiarities were two long poles or spars, which lay along its sides, projecting beyond the bows. These were the outriggers. At the projecting end of each spar was fixed an iron <b>case,</b> <b>bearing</b> some resemblance in shape and size to an elongated kettle-drum. These were the torpedoes. I heard the lieutenant explain to my mother that if one of these torpedoes chanced to explode where it hung, it would blow the boat and men to atoms. To which my mother replied, [...] "Horrible!" [...] and asked how, in that case, the crew could fire it and escape. Whereupon he responded, [...] "You shall see presently." ...|$|E

And one lady observed, as a <b>case</b> <b>bearing</b> upon the present, that her husband was often quite light-headed from anxiety on similar occasions, and that once, when her little Johnny was born, it was nearly a week before he came to himself again, during the whole of which time he did nothing but cry 'Is it a boy, is it a boy?' in a manner which went to the hearts of all his hearers.|$|E

To investigate the IGHV mutational status impact on genetic lesions, this study combined single nucleotide polymorphism-arrays and IGHV sequencing in 83 cases.

40|$|Duplex {{hardening}} is {{a process}} in which conventional heat-treatments such as secondary or case hardening are followed up by surface nitriding to achieve exceptional properties, particularly in the context of aeroengine bearings. Hardness values in excess of 1 000 HV can in principle be achieved, and although the hardness decreases as a function of depth below the surface, some level of enhancement can occur to a depth of up to 0. 2 mm. The process can be applied to both through hardened and <b>case</b> hardened <b>bearing</b> steels such as M 50 and M 50 NiL respectively, with concomitant increases in rolling contact fatigue resistance and tribological properties. The process has not yet been universally adopted and is ripe for a critical assessment. KEY WORDS: duplex hardening; nitriding; <b>case</b> hardening; <b>bearing</b> steels...|$|R
