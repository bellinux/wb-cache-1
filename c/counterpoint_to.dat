5|$|Light {{falls on}} the {{pictorial}} space from the left, creating shadows against the back wall, the strongest cast by the girl's hennin. The depth of space provided by the back wall gives room for this detailing, which Charles Sterling believes is indebted to van Eyck. The light throws a murky but curved shadow {{on the wall behind}} the girl and acts as a <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> the contour of her cheek and hairline.|$|E
5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{following}} the Union of Lublin, became a <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> the absolute monarchies gaining power in Europe. Its quasi-democratic political system of Golden Liberty, albeit limited to nobility, was mostly unprecedented {{in the history}} of Europe. In itself, it constituted a fundamental precedent for the later development of European constitutional monarchies.|$|E
5|$|The smaller, higher pitched gong, the thicker of the two, {{is called}} the panentekan by the Maguindanao and the p'malsan or pumalsan by the Maranao. Found on the player’s left, it is mainly played on the weaker double and triple beats of the rhythmic structure, in <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> the pangandungan's part.|$|E

50|$|In 1945, Juana Lumerman {{spent a year}} exhibiting, {{traveling}} and working in Brazil. Throughout Lumerman's career, dynamic images of carnival, soccer and tango were <b>to</b> serve as <b>counterpoints</b> <b>to</b> more statically structured, more metaphysical, cityscape and still life themes in her painting.|$|R
5000|$|In {{one of the}} 2005 e-mails {{obtained}} by class-action lawsuit plaintiffs, the company's communications consultants had written about plans to track Hayes' speaking engagements and prepare audiences with Syngenta's <b>counterpoints</b> <b>to</b> Hayes's message on atrazine. Syngenta subsequently stated {{that many of the}} documents unsealed in the lawsuits refer to [...] "ideas that were never implemented." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Buddhism during {{the sixth century}} was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence from the Chinese Tang and Sui Dynasties led to {{the foundation of the}} first permanent capital in Nara. Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of Chang'an as a template for its design. A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design. The {{introduction of}} the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> the excesses of the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|Captain Archibald Haddock (Capitaine Haddock in Hergé's {{original}} version) is a Merchant Marine sea {{captain and}} Tintin's best friend. Introduced in The Crab with the Golden Claws, Haddock is initially {{depicted as a}} weak and alcoholic character, but later evolves to become genuinely heroic and even a socialite after he finds a treasure from his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (Chevalier François de Hadoque in the original version). The Captain's coarse humanity and sarcasm act as a <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> Tintin's often-implausible heroism; he is always quick with a dry comment whenever the boy reporter seems too idealistic. After he and Tintin find Red Rackham's treasure, Captain Haddock lives in the luxurious mansion Marlinspike Hall (Le château de Moulinsart in the original French).|$|E
5|$|In England, ruined medieval castles became fashionable {{again in}} the middle of the 18th century. They were {{considered}} an interesting <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> Palladian classical architecture, and gave a degree of medieval allure to their owners. Some keeps were modified to exaggerate this effect: Hawarden, for example, was remodelled to appear taller but also more decayed, the better to produce a good silhouette. The interest continued and, in the late 18th and 19th century, it became fashionable to build intact, replica castles in England, resulting in what A. Rowan has called the Norman style of new castle building, characterised by the inclusion of large keeps; the final replica keep to be built in this way was at Penrhyn between 1820 and 1840.|$|E
2500|$|Kimmel {{began his}} {{television}} career as the comedic counterpart to Ben Stein {{on the game}} show Win Ben Stein's Money, which began airing on Comedy Central in 1997. His quick wit and [...] "everyman" [...] personality were <b>counterpoints</b> <b>to</b> Stein's monotonous vocal style and faux-patrician demeanor. The combination earned the pair an Emmy award for Best Game Show Host.|$|R
50|$|A fugue {{usually has}} two main sections: the {{exposition}} and the body. In the exposition, each voice plays its own {{adaptation of the}} theme, in either a subject or an answer; they also provide countersubjects (<b>counterpoints)</b> <b>to</b> the following voices as they enter. The exposition usually ends on either a I or V chord, and is then followed by the body.|$|R
50|$|This current {{exhibition}} tract {{has thus}} far allowed the museum to attempt at tentative but nevertheless less canonical, and perhaps necessary re-consideration of the bodies of work of artists it has {{had a hand in}} validating through its collections. It has likewise created opportunities for LMM to interrogate its own museological track amidst the parallel practices of other institutions it works alongside with or to which it serves as de facto <b>counterpoints</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Solaris {{features}} Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale prelude for organ, Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 639, played by Leonid Roizman, and an electronic score by Eduard Artemyev. The prelude {{is the central}} musical theme of Solaris. Tarkovsky initially wanted the film to be devoid of music and asked composer Artemyev to orchestrate ambient sounds as a musical score. The latter proposed subtly introducing orchestral music. In <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> classical music as Earth's theme is fluid electronic music as the theme for the planet Solaris. The character of Hari has her own subtheme, a cantus firmus based upon J. S. Bach's music featuring Artemyev's composition atop it; it is heard at Hari's death and at story's end.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the first film was made, {{the cast and crew}} signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy. They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of his fame and success, while The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) was still being {{performed}} in London, Wilde had the Marquess of Queensberry prosecuted for criminal libel. The Marquess was the father of Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The libel trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for gross indecency with men. After two more trials he was convicted and sentenced to two years' hard labour, the maximum penalty, and was jailed from 1895 to 1897. During his last year in prison, he wrote De Profundis (published posthumously in 1905), a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials, forming a dark <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> his earlier philosophy of pleasure. Upon his release, he left immediately for France, never to return to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life. He died destitute in Paris at the age of 46.|$|E
2500|$|Yale law {{professor}} William Eskridge, a harsh {{critic of the}} decision, has called it [...] "the most frequently criticized example of excessively strict stare decisis." [...] It is often <b>counterpointed</b> <b>to</b> the Court's decision in the 1940 trust case Helvering v. Hallock, where Justice Felix Frankfurter explicitly rejected the idea, embraced by Blackmun in Flood, that the Court should consider congressional inaction as a tacit statement of acquiescence with one of its existing holdings, however questionable they may have seemed. Eskridge notes {{that there are many}} reasons besides express lack of intent that would forestall Congressional action to remedy a flawed Court decision.|$|R
40|$|When I am {{involved}} in interdisciplinary collaborations with mathematicians and scientists, physical models and objects have proved <b>to</b> be powerful <b>counterpoints</b> <b>to</b> virtual models and data sets. I will discuss my use of rapid prototyping {{to make such}} objects, and contrast that to my earlier screen-based and online artworks. The use of rapid prototyping reconfirms {{the importance of the}} material properties of objects in my art practice, but accessing rapid prototyping machines is not easy. I will highlight some of the limitations of the rapid prototyping process and suggest reasons why fine art objects made with these processes are relatively rare...|$|R

While Stumpy's {{appearance}} and demeanour epitomise existential ennui, Freddie [...] - [...] as befits his tender years [...] - [...] {{is a vital}} and innocent spirit, insuppressibly enthusiastic and trusting; the pair provide two different <b>counterpoints</b> <b>to</b> the single-minded irascibility of the protagonist.Other recurring minor characters include robots (and their natural enemies, bears), ninjas, Daleks (from Doctor Who) and various evil masterminds. Dick Cheney, Kofi Annan, and other world leaders have also appeared as characters on occasion.|$|R
5|$|John Greyson became {{interested}} in offering a <b>counterpoint</b> <b>to</b> the Patient Zero story as early as 1987, when the Patient Zero meme began entering the public consciousness following the publication of Randy Shilts's book And the Band Played On. The book described the cluster study {{which led to the}} popular identification of flight attendant Gaëtan Dugas as the vector through which HIV was first brought to North America. It should be noted, however, that Shilts himself never claimed that Dugas was the first. In early 1991 Greyson was given a development grant for the script from the Canadian Film Centre, of which Greyson is an alumnus. Over the next year Greyson, in collaboration with Film Centre partners Louise Garfield and Anna Stratton, continued to develop the script, eventually presenting it with producer Alexandra Raffé in a workshop format. During the first half of 1992, the production team secured additional development funding from the Canada Council, Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation. By June of that year the script and the songs were completed and that autumn, with funds from the Telefilm Canada and OFDC grants along with revenue from the sale of British broadcast rights to Channel 4, pre-production and casting got underway. Principal photography began in November 1992 and wrapped after five weeks. Sneak previews took place at the Seattle International Film Festival and a number of LGBT film festivals across the United States before its official debut in September 1993 at Toronto's Festival of Festivals.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} unique {{collection}} of Scottish outsider art, labelled Art Extraordinary, as {{a window into}} the often neglected small spaces of asylum care in the early twentieth century. By drawing upon materials from the Art Extraordinary collection and its associated archives, this paper demonstrates the importance of incorporating small and everyday spaces of care – such as gardens, paths, studios and boats – into the broader historical narratives of psychiatric care in Scotland. Examples of experiential memorialization and <b>counterpoints</b> <b>to</b> asylum surveillance culture will be illuminated. The significance of using ‘outsider’ art collections as a valuable source in tracing geographical histories will be highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore the messages and impact of three young adult dystopian trilogies, The Hunger Games, Divergent and The Uglies. In particular, the role of the American female teenager in political, economic and social spheres is discussed through examining the three female teenaged protagonists of these novels. For comparative purposes, George Orwell’s 1984 and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World function as <b>counterpoints</b> <b>to</b> the young adult novels; the analysis of these different novels will prove that young adult dystopian novels show young adult women that their choices and actions can be integral to their societies on a political, economic and social level...|$|R
