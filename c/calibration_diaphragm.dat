40|$|A {{pressure}} switch assembly comprising a body portion and a switch mechanism having a contact element operable between opposite limit positions is described. A diaphragm chamber {{is provided in}} the body portion which mounts therein a system diaphragm and a <b>calibration</b> <b>diaphragm</b> which are of generally the same configuration and having outer faces conforming to {{the inner and outer}} walls of the diaphragm chamber. The space between the inner faces of the diaphragms defines a first chamber section and the space between the outer face of one of the diaphragms and the outer wall of the diaphragm chamber defines a second chamber section. The body portion includes a system pressure port communicating with one of the chamber sections and a calibration pressure port communicating with the other chamber section. An actuator connected to one of the diaphragms and the contact element of the switch operates upon pressure change in the diaphragm sections to move said contact element between limit positions...|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Section J of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE The procedure describes the mechanics of the stabilometer, including procedures for operation, <b>calibration,</b> and <b>diaphragm</b> installation. The stabilometer is used to establish R-values for treated and untreated soils and stability values for bituminous mixtures. B. APPARATUS AND MATERIALS 1. A stabilometer and stage base are required as shown in Figure 1. 2. A standard metal specimen with a nominal outside diameter of 101. 5 mm and a length of 165 mm. 3. A pressure-checking device shall consist of one of the following: a. An Ashton double area gage tester with a hydraulic system is accept- able. a. A diaphragm pretensioning installation device is required illustrated in Figure 2. and as b. c. A Bourdon tube gage with a maximum capacity of 1. 4 MPa. The gage shall be sensitive to 0. 5 % of the total scale. It shall be a hydraulic system with minimum dial face diameter of 150 mm. A dead weight tester is acceptable. 4. A diaphragm installation kit shall consist of the following...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{accurate}} determination of high vacuum pressure are reviewed with particular {{attention paid to}} the 10 - 6 to 10 - 5 Torr range. The first method is characterized by calculating the pressure generated from {{a knowledge of the}} characteristics and geometry of the vacuum chamber. Static and dynamic expansion techniques are examined. The second method establishes a pressure in the vacuum chamber by balancing an input of gas against a pumping speed and measuring the resulting pressure with a suitable gauge. McLeod, spinning rotor, hot-filament ion, and capacitance diaphragm gauges are discussed. Additionally, new results for ion and capacitance diaphragm gauges are presented including an extension of the range of capacitance diaphragm gauges down to 10 - 6 Torr through the use of averaging and a new technique for the direct <b>calibration</b> of capacitance <b>diaphragm</b> gauges between 10 - 6 and 10 - 4 Torr which uses gravity to deflect the diaphragm and generate apparent pressures...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{transpiration}} {{effects are}} commonly encountered in low pressure measurements with capacitance diaphragm gauges. They {{arise from the}} temperature difference between the measurement volume and the temperature stabilised manometer. Several approaches have been proposed to correct for the pressure difference, but surface and geometric effects usually require that the correction is determined for each gas type and gauge individually. Common (semi) empirical corrections are based on studies of atoms or small molecules. We present a simple <b>calibration</b> method for <b>diaphragm</b> gauges and compare transpiration corrections for argon and styrene at pressures above 1 Pa. We find that characteristic pressures at which the pressure difference reaches half its maximum value, are compatible with the universal scaling p_ 1 / 2 = 2 {η·{v_th / d, thus essentially depending on gas viscosity η, thermal molecular speed v_th and gauge tubing diameter d. This contradicts current recommendations based on the Takaishi and Sensui formula, which show an unphysical scaling with molecular size. Our results support the Miller or Šetina equations where the pressure dependency is basically determined by the Knudsen number. The use of these two schemes is therefore recommended, especially when thermal transpiration has to be predicted for new molecules. Implications for investigations on large polyatomics are discussed. Comment: 15 pages, 7 figures Several minor corrections (erroneous values and units in Tabs 1 and 2, formulas). Sections 3 and 4 have been refined upon reviewer requests: incorrect assumptions about dimensions (Fig. 3) and temperature sensitivity of the CDG were eliminated. Formulas have been rephrased to be in line with original definitions in Refs 30 and 44. No effect on the main conclusion...|$|R
