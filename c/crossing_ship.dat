50|$|If a ship {{wants to}} cross a traffic-lane it should do so at a right angle to avoid {{endangering}} ship traffic using the traffic-lanes (although traffic in the lane does not automatically have the right-of-way). To minimize {{the amount of time}} a <b>crossing</b> <b>ship</b> spend crossing the traffic-lanes, there should be a right angle between the lane direction and the keel direction - even if currents might shift the actual direction of the ship's movement to some angle other than 90 degrees.|$|E

40|$|Connectivity {{among the}} islands in {{eastern part of}} Indonesia is low and {{operation}} offerry ineffective and inefficient so that it requires the optimal fleet of new ferries. This research aimed to obtain the flowchart model of the <b>crossing</b> <b>ship</b> design optimization based {{on the impact of}} the request condition, infrastructures, and oceanography. This was a quantitative research using an optimization technique with linear programming method. Data used were the secondary data obtained from the previous research result, demand conditions based on load characteristic, infrastructure based on port facility, oceanographic based on wave high and wind velocity, and data the crossing ships operating in eastern part of Indonesia. The flowchart model of the <b>crossing</b> <b>ship</b> design optimization has been obtained using inequality constraints of the ratio of Loa/H (12 - 16, 5), ratio of Loa/B (3, 47 - 4, 52), ratio B/T (5, 1 - 6, 67), ratio of H/T (1, 4 - 1, 68), Froude number Fn ??? 0, 3, freeboard Fb ??? 1, 76. Loa 1, 43 mm, block coefficient CB (0, 37 - 0, 69), ship stability MG (0, 5 - 2, 2 m), and rolling period Troll ??? 7 seconds, with equation constrain of the ship weight balance ((??V?????W) /??V ??? 0, 05). The optimization of the <b>crossing</b> <b>ship</b> design with the objective function gets the significant minimum ship operational cost which lies on the ship steel weight (WST) that is linear with the ship price rise (PS) ...|$|E
50|$|The Japanese {{government}} in August 1942 announced that no neutral ship, even a Red <b>Cross</b> <b>ship,</b> {{would be allowed}} to enter Japanese waters. Red Cross parcels intended for Allied PoWs in Japan were accordingly stockpiled in Vladivostok, Russia, and a single ship was ultimately permitted to transport some of these to Japan in November 1944. How many of these actually reached the PoWs is not known, and the sinking of the Red <b>Cross</b> <b>ship</b> prevented any future shipments from being made.|$|R

50|$|For water crossings, {{a tunnel}} is {{generally}} more costly to construct than a bridge.

50|$|Despite {{being told}} of this decision, Jaeger {{continued}} to protest it. He presented multiple arguments. First, {{there was no}} possible way to transport the Jews off of the island. Second, Jaeger argued that the Italians on Corfu presented a greater threat than the Jews, “against whom incidentally there have never been any complaints”. Third, {{he noted that the}} Greeks on the island supported the Jews. Fourth, a Red <b>Cross</b> <b>ship</b> was in the harbor delivering aid. This ship could potentially witness deportations and fuel ‘atrocities propaganda’, fueling the Allies' propaganda campaign.|$|R
