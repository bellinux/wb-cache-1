5|$|Bank1 {{electronically}} transmits {{the check}} {{image and the}} MICR line data captured from the original check to the paying bank (Bank2) for settlement. If no agreement exists between Bank1 and Bank2 to exchange check images and data, Bank1 must provide either the original <b>check</b> <b>or</b> the legal equivalent of the substitute check to Bank2.|$|E
5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers <b>check</b> <b>or</b> checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces {{on the table in}} front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of common}} usage of {{compiler}} pragmas {{would be to}} disable certain features, such as run-time type <b>checking</b> <b>or</b> array subscript boundary <b>checking,</b> <b>or</b> to instruct the compiler to insert object code {{in lieu of a}} function call (as C/C++ does with inline functions).|$|R

5|$|NHL 17, an {{ice hockey}} {{simulation}} video game, uses the Ignite engine, created by Electronic Arts. During a game, players maneuver around the ice with normal skating and deking {{and are able}} to seamlessly pass to teammates to create scoring chances. If a player scores a goal, they are able to celebrate the way they want to; many new celebrations were added to the game. One newly added celebration was a mimicked version of baseball player José Bautista's iconic bat flip that occurred during the 2015 American League Division Series. Defensively, the player can skate their way to the puck carrier and have a chance to break up the play. The player has multiple ways of doing so; pushing the carrier off of the puck, delivering a body <b>check,</b> <b>or</b> pushing them towards the boards of the ice. If they wish, the player can enable the On-Ice Trainer, a system made to assist the player as they play. NHL 17 features game presentation {{in the style of the}} NHL on NBC, with commentary being provided by Mike Emrick (play-by-play), Eddie Olczyk (color) and Ray Ferraro (ice-side reporter), with the network's score bug appearing on-screen as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in <b>check</b> <b>or,</b> optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E

25|$|Different sets {{of rules}} set {{different}} limits {{on what is}} considered perpetual. For example, club xiangqi rules allow a player to <b>check</b> <b>or</b> chase six consecutive times using one piece, twelve times using two pieces, and eighteen times using three pieces before considering the action perpetual.|$|E
25|$|Since in xiangqi {{the general}} is usually safest in his {{original}} position before the endgame phase, attacking the general commonly involves forcing the general {{out of his}} original position with <b>check</b> <b>or</b> with threats.

25|$|Two {{common types}} of toss-ups include buzzer-beaters and {{pyramidal}} tossups. Buzzer-beaters (also known as speed <b>check</b> <b>or</b> quick-recall questions) are relatively short, rarely {{more than two}} sentences long, and contain few clues. This type of question is written specifically to test quick recall skills of players, and does not discriminate the different levels of knowledge that the players possess.|$|E

40|$|The type {{system of}} most modern {{functional}} programming languages {{is based on}} Milner's polymorphism. A compiler <b>or</b> interpreter usually <b>checks</b> (<b>or</b> infers) the types of functions and other values by directly inspecting the source code of a program.

25|$|Casinos: In this method, an {{individual}} {{walks into a}} casino and buys chips with illicit cash. The individual will then play for a relatively short time.

25|$|The {{process of}} verifying and {{enforcing}} {{the constraints of}} types—type checking—may occur either at compile-time (a static <b>check)</b> <b>or</b> at run-time. If a language specification requires its typing rules strongly (i.e., more or less allowing only those automatic type conversions that do not lose information), one can refer to the process as strongly typed, if not, as weakly typed. The terms are not usually used in a strict sense.|$|E

25|$|Research is {{primarily}} performed in non-human primates {{such as the}} rhesus macaque. These studies can be used both to <b>check</b> <b>or</b> predict human results and to validate the fMRI technique itself.

It is also expensive to maintain a colony of larger animals such as the macaque.|$|E
25|$|Resorts may ban persons {{convicted of}} sex, drug, or violent crimes. Policies vary, but might include doing a {{criminal}} record <b>check</b> <b>or</b> checking a sex offender registry.
