500|$|Max Bemis {{was raised}} [...] "in a strong Jewish environment." [...] Many of Bemis' lyrics borrow from his Jewish roots, and contain {{elements}} of Jewish humor. [...] While most of band's earlier songs {{are free of}} any such inspiration, the songs of ...Is a Real Boy and In Defense of the Genre include references to Jewish heritage. [...] "Alive with the Glory of Love," [...] Say Anything's first single, has a main subject of a relationship affected by World War II and the Holocaust, based on Bemis's grandparents, [...] while [...] "Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too" [...] includes mentions of [...] "the old shul" [...] and a rabbi's teachings. [...] A strong example from In Defense comes from the lyrics of [...] "Died a Jew". The song includes several references to the Jewish people and its history along with mentions of [...] "the murder of God" [...] and Bemis' departures from kosher. [...] References to religion come again in [...] "Fed to Death" [...] on Say Anything, referring to a 'man from Nazareth' who would one day 'spring to life to smile and <b>clear</b> <b>your</b> name' but until then 'nail yourself upon the cross and hang your head in shame.' ...|$|E
500|$|... "Next" [...] {{was written}} by Jenna Bans and Kevin Murphy and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. While developing storylines for the second season, series creator Marc Cherry stated, [...] "I want to keep {{finding new ways to}} talk about issues that relate to everyday women," [...] explaining that the show needs to focus on [...] "small, real, everyday issues" [...] {{in order to keep the}} audience interested. Cherry cited the Lynette storyline as an example of this strategy: [...] "Lynette will have a job next season (returning to her advertising roots), so I want to address how difficult it is to go to work all day and then come home and be expected to also take care of your house." [...] Huffman recognized that her character's storylines needed a change of pace, but hoped that Lynette's domestic life would still play an integral role this season. [...] "My hope is to not get lost in the corporate world; that it's still a home and family/husband and children story," [...] she explained. [...] "But how many times can you go, 'Kids, <b>clear</b> <b>your</b> plates!'" [...] The episode also introduced Joely Fisher as Lynette's new boss, Nina Fletcher. Fisher describes her character as [...] "nasty," [...] elaborating: [...] "Lynette suddenly has to come up against this tiger lady who never stops reminding Lynette that she's childless by choice. Even though Nina is not a housewife, she is desperate in her own way." [...] Due to the death of his character, Steven Culp did not return to the series for the second season. For the open casket scene in [...] "Next", producers created a life mask of the actor. Savant was promoted to series regular after appearing as a recurring guest star throughout the first season.|$|E

It is not I who speaks; / It is a love that is desperate, / It is the grief of a wounded heart".) Arturo continues to describe the [...] "torturing madness of a burning heart" [...] while Valdeburgo explains that, for Alaide's peace of mind, Arturo must leave her in peace and that he should fulfill his promises to Isoletta by marrying her. [...] Reluctantly, Arturo agrees to return to marry Isoletta, but asks that Alaide attend his wedding so he can see her one last time. Valdeburgo agrees.|$|E

[...] Game Informers Andrew Reiner wrote [...] "True Crime is the first game {{to come along and}} truly give the Grand Theft Auto series a run for its money." [...] However, he called Nick Kang [...] "quite easily the most annoying new character in video games." [...] GameSpy's Russ Fischer wrote [...] "there's more to True Crime than GTA emulation." [...] GameSpot's Jeff Gertsmann called Kang [...] "completely unlikeable" [...] and [...] "an unnecessarily cocky jerk." [...] Of the gameplay, he wrote [...] "it makes decent attempts with its different styles of gameplay, but none of them are particularly well done." [...] Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell was critical of the graphics, citing [...] "low-resolution textures, some clipping issues, a rather horrible depth of field effect and a lack of screen-filling vistas." [...] He also called Kang [...] "one of the most unlikeable folks I've ever had the displeasure of thumbing around a third-person action game". However, he concluded [...] "it's a respectable enough game in its own right." ...|$|E

[...] He praised the gameplay, especially the Good Cop/Bad Cop system and the upgrades system. He also praised the absence of loading screens. However, he wrote of the graphics, [...] "there are far too many clipping issues that come up far too often to be ignored. Similarly, the camera ties into the clipping problems so {{that there will be}} times when the camera will float through and behind a wall or tree during a fight so that you can't see the action at all." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime is an enjoyable game if you can <b>clear</b> <b>your</b> mind of Grand Theft Auto expectations [...] It's a lot of fun despite the burden of the camera system and other technical glitches. It doesn't, nor should it, replace Grand Theft Auto by any means. True Crime has enough good to counter the bad and stand on its own." [...] Boulding and Tom McNamara scored the PC version 8 out of 10, writing [...] "the multiplayer that many of us have been salivating for is almost disorientingly low-budget." [...] They were also critical of the controls and graphics, concluding [...] "the rich fighting component and the shooting and driving mechanics aren't translated well to the PC, with awkward controls, poor texture quality, and odd visual bugs. Plus, multiplayer, the hot magnet exclusive to the PC version, is decidedly half-baked." ...|$|E
