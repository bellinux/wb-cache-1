40|$|Glucocorticosteroids {{are widely}} used in the {{treatment}} of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Initially there was much enthusiasm for their use, arising from the striking relief of symptoms seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with <b>corticosteroids.</b> When the wide array of potentially serious adverse effects became apparent, the use of <b>corticosteroids</b> decreased. More recently, however, the careful use of <b>corticosteroids</b> in patients with rheumatoid arthritis has been generally accepted. New insights into the mechanisms of action of <b>corticosteroids,</b> especially their effects on the immune system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, have provided more insight into, and rationale for, the use of <b>corticosteroids</b> in rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical data on the effectiveness of low dosage oral <b>corticosteroids,</b> high dosage systemic <b>corticosteroids</b> and intra-articular injections of <b>corticosteroids</b> are scarce, In contrast, data on the adverse effects of oral low dosage <b>corticosteroids</b> are abundant.

40|$|<b>Corticosteroids</b> {{are used}} to treat a variety of conditions; discontinuing them during preg-nancy {{sometime}} exacerbates these conditions. <b>Corticosteroids</b> are available alone or in combina-tion with other drugs for systemic, inhaled, and topical use. Systemic <b>corticosteroids</b> are used for autoimmune and infl ammatory conditions. Inhaled steroids are now first-line treatment for asthma. Topical <b>corticosteroids</b> are frequently used to treat allergic and infl ammatory dermatologic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Existing data on the safety of <b>corticosteroids</b> during preg-nancy, particularly during the fi rst trimester, are often confl icting and diffi cult to interpret.

5|$|All <b>corticosteroid</b> hormones share {{cholesterol}} as {{a common}} precursor. Therefore, {{the first step in}} steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The other source of cholesterol is synthesis in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low. In the lysosome, cholesterol esters are converted to free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.|$|E
5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural <b>corticosteroid</b> injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} intravenous <b>corticosteroids</b> in the acute management of pediatric orbital cellulitis with subperiosteal abscess. Methods: The inpatient records of all patients treated for orbital cellulitis with subperiosteal orbital abscess between January 2001 and August 2003 were reviewed. The use of <b>corticosteroids,</b> length of hospital stay, need for surgical drainage, treatment course, and clinical outcomes were reviewed. A t test and Fisher exact test analysis were calculated to evaluate statistical significance. Results: Twelve patients received intravenous <b>corticosteroids</b> and 11 patients did not receive <b>corticosteroids.</b> All patients had complete resolution of their abscess without complications. Length of hospitalization between the patients treated with and without intravenous <b>corticosteroids</b> was not significantly different (p 0. 26). Four of 12 patients treated with intravenous <b>corticosteroids</b> underwent orbitotomy for drainage of the abscess, and 6 of 11 patients treated without intravenous <b>corticosteroids</b> underwent surgical drainage (p 0. 20). Two of 12 patients treated with <b>corticosteroids</b> received intravenous antibiotics after discharge, whereas 7 of 11 in the group not treated with <b>corticosteroids</b> received intravenous antibiotics after discharge (p 0. 03). Conclusions: The use of intravenous <b>corticosteroids</b> does not appear to adversely affect clinical outcomes and may be beneficial in the treatment of pediatric orbital cellulitis with subperiosteal abscess.

5|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is a congenital {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate <b>corticosteroid</b> synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} cancers {{in the brain}} come from {{elsewhere}} in the body – most commonly the lung, breast and skin. Cancers of brain tissue can also occur, and originate from any tissue {{in and around the}} brain. Meningioma, cancer of the meninges around the brain, is more common than cancers of brain tissue. Cancers within the brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position, with symptoms including headache and nausea, or the gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing, swallowing, talking, or as a change of mood. Cancers are in general investigated through the use of CT scans and MRI scans. A variety of other tests including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for the cause of the cancer and evaluate the type and stage of the cancer. The <b>corticosteroid</b> dexamethasone is often given to decrease the swelling of brain tissue around a tumour. Surgery may be considered, however given the complex nature of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable.|$|E

40|$|When fitness {{benefits}} {{of investment in}} sons and daughters differ, animals are predicted to manipulate the sex ratio of their offspring. Sex ratio manipulation occurs in many taxa, but the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon in vertebrates remain largely unknown. Factors favoring skewed sex ratios, such as reduced maternal condition or food availability, also induce elevated <b>corticosteroids.</b> Recent experimental studies support a causal relationship between <b>corticosteroids</b> and sex ratio. Evidence of a natural correlation between maternal <b>corticosteroids</b> and offspring sex ratio has been lacking, however. Without such evidence, the importance of <b>corticosteroids</b> in influencing sex ratios in natural populations was unknown. We measured baseline <b>corticosteroids</b> in 19 free-ranging female white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys) and the sex ratios of their offspring. Females with high <b>corticosteroids</b> produced more daughters than females with low hormone levels. We then conducted a controlled, field-based experiment investigating the effects of moderately increased maternal <b>corticosteroids</b> on offspring sex ratios {{to determine if the}} observed correlation reflects a causal relationship between maternal <b>corticosteroids</b> and offspring sex ratio. Hormone-implanted females produced more female embryos than control females.
