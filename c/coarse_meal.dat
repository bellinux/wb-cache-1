60|$|Close {{under the}} Calton Hill there runs a certain narrow avenue, part street, part by-road. The head of it faces {{the doors of}} the prison; its tail descends into the sunless slums of the Low Calton. On one hand it is {{overhung}} by the crags of the hill, on the other by an old graveyard. Between these two the roadway runs in a trench, sparsely lighted at night, sparsely frequented by day, and bordered, when it has cleared the place of tombs, by dingy and ambiguous houses. One of these was the house of Collette; and at his door our ill-starred John was presently beating for admittance. In an evil hour he satisfied the jealous inquiries of the contraband hotel-keeper; in an evil hour he penetrated into the somewhat unsavoury interior. Alan, to be sure, was there, seated in a room lit by noisy gas-jets, beside a dirty table-cloth, engaged on a <b>coarse</b> <b>meal,</b> and in the company of several tipsy members of the junior Bar. But Alan was not sober; he had lost a thousand pounds upon a horse-race, had received the news at dinner-time, and was now, in default of any possible means of extrication, drowning the memory of his predicament. He to help John! The thing was impossible; he couldn't help himself.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} morning the tap {{at the bottom}} of the boiler was turned, and the syrup came out bright and clear,--about the colour of sherry wine. The scum descended unbroken on the surface of the liquor; and when the copper was nearly empty the tap was closed, and the scum and what little liquor remained was taken out. The bright syrup was now again poured into the boiler, the fire re-lighted, and the syrup was kept boiling, to evaporate the water and condense the syrup down to the point at which it would crystallize. It required many hours' boiling to effect this, any scum which rose to the surface being carefully taken off with a skimmer. At last it was found that the syrup on the skimmer began to crystallize, and Mr. Hardy pronounced it to be fit to draw off into the large washing tubs to crystallize. A fresh batch of canes was now crushed, and so the process was repeated until all the canes were cut. It took a fortnight altogether, but only five days of this were actually occupied in cutting and crushing the canes. As the sugar crystallized it was taken out,--a dark, pulpy-looking mass, at which the young Hardys looked very doubtfully,--and was placed in a large sugar hogshead, which had been procured for the purpose. In the bottom of this eight large holes were bored, and these were stopped up with pieces of plantain stalk. Through the porous substance of these stalks the molasses or treacle slowly drained off. As the wet sugar was placed in the cask, layers of slices of plantain stems were laid upon it, as the spongy substance draws the dark colouring matter out from the sugar. The plantain grows freely in South America, and Mr. Hardy had planted a number of this graceful tree near his house; but these had not been advanced enough to cut, and he had therefore procured a sufficient quantity from a friend at Rosario. It was three months before the drainage of the molasses quite ceased; and the Hardys were greatly pleased, on emptying the hogshead and removing the plantain stems, to find that their sugar was dry, and of a very fairly light colour. The sugar-canes did not require planting again, as they will grow for many years from the same roots; and although the canes from old stools, as they are called, produce less sugar than those of the first year's planting, the juice is clearer, and requires far less trouble to prepare and refine. Before another year came round, the boys made a pair of wooden rollers of eighteen inches in diameter. These were covered with strips of hoop iron, nailed lengthways upon them at short intervals from each other, thereby obtaining a better grip upon the canes, and preventing the wood from being bruised and grooved. These rollers were worked by a horse mill, which Mr. Hardy had ordered from England. It was made for five horses, and did a great deal of useful work, grinding the Indian corn into fine flour for home consumption and for sale to neighbouring settlers, and into <b>coarse</b> <b>meal,</b> and pulping the pumpkins and roots for the pigs and other animals.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Food type white sorghum (ATx 631 xRTx 436) grown in College Station, 2001 was used to produce direct expanded snacks. Corn meal was used as reference. Sorghum grains were analyzed for their density, hardness, weight, and size. Sorghum was decorticated to remove 0 (whole) and 20 % of its initial weight. Both whole (WS) and decorticated sorghums (DS) were milled and sifted into <b>coarse</b> and fine <b>meals.</b> Meals were analyzed for chemical composition and physical properties. All meals were extruded with a single screw cooking-extruder (Wenger X- 20) using optimum extrusion conditions for <b>coarse</b> corn <b>meal.</b> The extrudates were analyzed for physical and sensory properties. Particle size distributions of <b>coarse</b> <b>meals</b> from WS and DS were adjusted to equal the particle size of corn meal. Decortication reduced fat, protein and fiber contents and lighten the color of the sorghum grains. Fine meals had higher pasting viscosities than <b>coarse</b> <b>meals.</b> Extrudates from <b>coarse</b> DS <b>meal</b> had the highest expansion ratio among sorghum extrudates. The environmental scanning electron microscope showed that extrudates from fine DS meal had thick cell walls probably due to the starch being overcooked and the extrudate structure collapsing after expansion. Extrudates from both DS meals were white with a bland taste. Particle size was important to produce good snacks but the composition, especially fat content, had more effect than the particle size. Extrudates from both WS meals had low expansion due to the higher fat and fiber and reduced starch contents. Fat and fiber act as lubricants during extrusion. Extrudates from WS were very hard and off-white with a mild after-taste. The extrusion conditions for WS and DS milled products would require adjustments to produce expanded snacks with properties similar to those of <b>coarse</b> corn <b>meal.</b> Sorghum can be used as raw material alone for direct expanded snacks. Extrudates from DS meals had excellent characteristics that were similar to extrudates from corn and other commercial extruded snacks. The mild flavor and light color suggests that sorghum can compete with rice in extruded snacks. The WS extrudates can be used to produce whole grain high fiber snacks...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} feeding {{different}} grinding levels {{and the effect}} of pelleted feed were tested on the salmonella-prevalence of finishing pigs. The feed was given to pigs in the weight interval from 27 to 99 kilos. The pigs were given dry feed ad libitum. The experiment comprised approximately 1, 000 finishers divided into four groups. In the test both meal and pelleted feed were used. The conclusions are: I. Meal feed gave a significantly lower salmonella level than heat-treated, pelleted feed. 2. The number of salmonella positive pigs were lower when using coarse grinding, but the effect of grinding level was not significant (P= 0. 08). 3. Pelleted feed gave a significantly higher production economy compared to meal feed - mainly due to a better feed conversion. 4. The content of starch in manure was affected by both grinding level and the pelleting process. Analyses showed approximately 25 times more starch in manure when using <b>coarse</b> grinded <b>meal</b> feed compared to fine grinded pelleted feed. 5. Pelleted feed gave a significantly poorer gastric health than meal feed. 6. The gastric health was considerably better when using <b>coarse</b> grinded <b>meal</b> feed compared to the other groups tested. It has been concluded that use of <b>coarse</b> grinded <b>meal</b> feed gives a better protection against salmonella, but the poorest economy.

5000|$|Native Americans {{had been}} using ground corn (maize) for food {{thousands}} of years before European explorers arrived in the New World.European settlers, especially those who resided in the English Southern Colonies, learned the original recipes and processes for corn dishes from the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Creek, and soon they devised recipes for using cornmeal in breads similar to those made of grains available in Europe. Cornbread {{has been called a}} [...] "cornerstone" [...] of the Cuisine of the Southern United States. Cornmeal is produced by grinding dry raw corn grains. A <b>coarser</b> <b>meal</b> (compare flour) made from corn is grits. Grits are produced by soaking raw corn grains in hot water containing calcium hydroxide (an alkaline salt), which loosens the grain hulls (bran) and increases the nutritional value of the product (by increasing available niacin and available amino acids). These are separated by washing and flotation in water, and the now softened slightly swelled grains are called hominy. Hominy, posole in Spanish, also is ground into masa harina for tamales and tortillas. This ancient Native American technology has been named nixtamalization. Besides cornbread, Native Americans used corn to make numerous other dishes from the familiar hominy grits to alcoholic beverages (such as Andean chicha). Cornbread was popular during the American Civil War because it was very cheap and could be made in many different forms—high-rising, fluffy loaves or simply fried (as unleavened pone, corn fritters, hoecakes, etc.) ...|$|R

The method of preparing desiccated vegetables was to squeeze them in a press to remove most of their juice and then bake them for several hours in a low temperature oven. The vegetables like dried peas kept well if kept dry {{and a piece of}} dried vegetables the size of a fist when put in water and cooked could feed four. The recommended food to take per adult for the four- to six-month trip was 150 lb of flour, 20 lb of corn meal, 50 lb of bacon, 40 lb of sugar, 10 lb of coffee, 15 lb of dried fruit, 5 lb of salt, half a pound (0.25 kg) of saleratus (baking soda), 2 lb of tea, 5 lb of rice, and 15 lb of beans. Condiments like: mustard, cinnamon, nutmeg, vinegar, pepper and other spices were usually included. Ex-trappers, ex-army soldiers and Indians often used pemmican made by pounding jerky until it was a <b>coarse</b> <b>meal,</b> putting it into a leather bag and then pouring rendered fat (and sometimes pulverized dried berries) over it—this was very light weight, could keep for months and provided a lot of energy. Some families took along milk cows and goats for milk and chickens (penned in crates tied to the wagons) for eggs and chicken dinners. Additional food like pickles, canned butter, cheese or pickled eggs were occasionally carried, but canned goods were expensive and relatively heavy to carry and food preservation was primitive, so few perishable items could be safely kept for the four to six-month duration of the trip. These provisions were usually kept in water-tight containers and carried inside the covered wagon to minimize getting wet. At river crossings their food usually had to be removed and carried across on a boat or raft to keep it dry—one of the reasons toll bridges or ferries were popular. Meat filled barrels (200 lb) were often bought and then, to reduce weight, the bacon and ham were usually transferred to bran filled sacks and stuck {{in the bottom of the}} wagons to stay as cool as possible—the barrel being discarded. In hot weather bacon and ham was often hauled in large barrels packed in bran so the hot sun would not melt the fat. Medicinal supplies carried usually consisted of salves and ointments, laudanum (about the only effective pain medicine then and much over used), and a few home remedies.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{questions}} have been raised on the possible semi-endogenous status of the alleged xenobiotic thyreostatic drug thiouracil; thiouracil has been detected in the urine of various animals (livestock and domesticated) at concentrations between 1 and 10 mu g L(- 1) and also in human urine. Although several studies suggest Brassicaceae-derived feed as potential origin, no traces of thiouracil have been detected in feed so far. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate the origin of thiouracil in the urine of livestock and humans. To this purpose various Brassicaceae feed and food sources (e. g., rapeseed, rapeseed <b>coarse</b> <b>meal,</b> cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli) were investigated for the presence of thiouracil. In addition, the impact of the Brassicaceae-related beta-thioglucosidase enzyme was evaluated. This myrosinase enzyme appeared to be crucial, because without its catalyzed hydrolysis no thiouracil could be detected in the various Brassicaceae-derived samples. Therefore, a sample pretreatment with incorporated enzymatic hydrolysis was developed after ensuring the quality performance of the extracted myrosinase mixture with a single-point glucose assay. Upon enzymatic hydrolysis and LC-MS(2) analysis, thiouracil was successfully detected in samples of traditional rapeseed, rapeseed-' 00 ' variety <b>coarse</b> <b>meal</b> (values of erucic acid < 2 % and glucosinolates < 25 mu mol g(- 1)), and rapeseed cake at 1. 5, 1. 6, and 0. 4 mu g kg(- 1), respectively.

All corn varieties had excellent pericarp removal at the optimum cooking time. Tortillas from QPM had better pliability and rollability after storage compared to FGM and HPC. HPC tortillas had lower rupture force after storage. The use of QPM for tortilla production may reduce energy and sewage cost, and could produce a tortilla with longer shelf stability with improved nutritional value. Decorticated and non-decorticated QPM, FGM and HPC grain were processed into corn meal and direct expanded snacks. A modified short scale dry milling system was used to produce the corn meal. QPM produced more <b>coarse</b> <b>meal</b> with greater fat content compared to FGM. Decortication decreased fiber content and <b>coarse</b> <b>meal</b> yield. Non-decorticated meal had greater protein, fiber and fat content compared to decorticated meal.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the ochratoxin contamination of the most important potential sources of OTA. The OTA content of cereal samples for human consumption (36 baking wheat, 16 wheat flour and 6 maize <b>coarse</b> <b>meal</b> samples) and feed grain samples (30 feeding wheat, 32 feeding maize and 20 feeding barley samples) collected in the mid-phase or at the end of the storage period and of 50 commercial coffee samples was determined. The analyses were performed by immunoaffinity column - high-performance liquid chromatography (IAC-HPLC). The limit of detection of the method was 0. 1 ng/g. Of the wheat samples intended for human consumption, 8. 3 % contained OTA at 0. 29 ng/g on the average (OTA ranges: 0. 12 - 0. 5 ng/g; Table 2). The OTA contamination of wheat flour and maize meal samples for human consumption was similar to that of the baking wheat samples. OTA contamination was found in 26. 7 % of the feeding wheat, 15. 6 % of the feeding maize and 35 % of the feeding barley samples. The average values and the ranges of OTA levels found in the above samples were 12. 2 and 0. 3 - 62. 8 ng/g, 4. 9 and 1. 9 - 8. 3 ng/g, and 72 and 0. 14 - 212 ng/g, respectively (Table 3). Sixty-six percent of the coffee samples were contaminated with OA (average level: 0. 57 ng/g, ranges: 0. 17 - 1. 3 ng/g; Table 4). OTA contamination of baking wheat samples was found to be relatively low, presumably as a result of the favourable weather at harvest and the optimal storage conditions. Calculations made on the basis of the obtained results show that the daily OTA intake of an adult human from edible cereals is only 6. 7 ng, while the amount taken up with coffee is 4. 1 ng daily. The high prevalence and high levels of OTA contamination in feed grains can be explained by the unfavourable storage conditions, and this finding suggests that OA-related health problems may arise in animals, and that foods of animal origin may be contaminated with this mycotoxin...|$|E
40|$|Pastries {{are very}} popular among the Russian population. Pastry {{are the most}} {{promising}} targets for the enrichment of their function ingredients [...] One {{of the most promising}} feedstocks for the production of flour confectionery products is flour from grain crops ofspring triticale. The different varieties of triticale were studied in particular, triticale flour grade "Ukro" for use in technologies of shortbread-butter cookies with enhanced food value. The first {{in the history of our}} country varieties of spring triticale "Ukro" was included in the State Register of selection achievements since 2004. Triticale is characterized by high-protein content. Triticale, protein is higher than in wheat by amino acids lysine and tryptophan, minerals (calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron), B vitamins. It was pointed the choice and ratio of prescription ingredients. Recipe shortbread-butter cookies based on the seeded triticale flour and flour from <b>coarse</b> whole <b>meal</b> grain, grade "Ukro", with high consumer properties was developed. Cake samples prepared on the basis of flour triticale exceed the reference sample of prime grade wheat flour. Biscuits have a high content of complete protein, vitamins, macro - and microelements, dietary fibers, high gustatory qualities. The influence of prescription components on organoleptic and physical-chemical properties of sandy butter cookies was studied. The nutritional and biological value was calculated. It was state the daily needs of the organism in these materials when using 100 g.  As a result of the conducted studies proved the feasibility of the use of flour from grain triticale in the production of flour confectionery products of functional purpose. </p...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{second thing}} {{from which a}} child suffers in prison is hunger. The food that is given to it {{consists}} {{of a piece of}} usually bad-baked prison bread and a tin of water for breakfast at half-past seven. At twelve o'clock it gets dinner, composed of a tin of <b>coarse</b> Indian <b>meal</b> stirabout (skilly), and at half-past five it gets a piece of dry bread and a tin of water for its supper. This diet {{in the case of a}} strong grown man is always productive of illness of some kind, chiefly of course diarrhoea, with its attendant weakness. In fact, in a big prison astringent medicines are served out regularly by the warders as a matter of course. In the case of a child, the child is, as a rule, incapable of eating the food at all. Any one who knows anything about children knows how easily a child's digestion is upset by a fit of crying, or trouble and mental distress of any kind. A child who has been crying all day long, and perhaps half the night, in a lonely dim-lit cell, and is preyed upon by terror, simply cannot eat food of this coarse, horrible kind. In the case of the little child to whom Warder Martin gave the biscuits, the child was crying with hunger on Tuesday morning, and utterly unable to eat the bread and water served to it for its breakfast. Martin went out after the breakfasts had been served and bought the few sweet biscuits for the child rather than see it starving. It was a beautiful action on his part, and was so recognised by the child, who, utterly unconscious of the regulations of the Prison Board, told one of the senior wardens how kind this junior warden had been to him. The result was, of course, a report and a dismissal." ...|$|R
40|$|Kafirin and zein are alcohol-soluble prolamin-type {{proteins}} {{that can be}} used to make biodegradable, environmental-friendly bioplastic films and coatings. Despite this potential, there is no commercial process for kafirin extraction. Zein, though commercially produced, is expensive. Factors affecting kafirin and zein extraction and bioplastic quality were studied. Specifically, the effects of sorghum and maize grain particle size, inclusion of glacial acetic acid and sodium hydroxide in the aqueous ethanol extractant on extract filtration time, protein preparation purity and yield; as well as effect of heating kafirin and zein films on water uptake and film digestibility were investigated. Sorghum meal with particle size > 1 mm gave more rapid extract filtration time than sorghum flour with particle size < 250 ?m, due to larger inter-particle spaces. Sorghum flour yielded a kafirin preparation with lower purity (50 %) than sorghum meal (58 %). Kafirin extracted from distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) had a higher purity (78 %) than kafirin from sorghum meal (68 %) and zein (69 %). Washing decorticated sorghum and maize meals to remove starch prior to protein extraction substantially increased protein preparation purity. Inclusion of sodium hydroxide resulted in a slightly higher protein preparation purity and yield than inclusion of acetic acid. SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions revealed more dimers in kafirin than zein, while kafirin from DDGS contained polymers, indicating polymerisation due to cross-linking occurring during DDGS drying. All films absorbed water but remained whole on soaking. Heat treated films prepared from kafirin extracted from washed sorghum meal absorbed less water (approximately 42 %), compared to zein films (approximately 47 %) due to its greater hydrophobicity and heat induced intermolecular disulphide cross-linking. Heating had no effect on DDGS kafirin film water uptake because it was highly cross-linked. In vitro pepsin and total digestion were less for kafirin films than zein films, probably due to the greater hydrophobicity of kafirin. Heating the films resulted in reduced digestibility, probably due to heat induced disulphide bonding. Extraction of kafirin and zein from <b>coarse</b> <b>meal</b> enables more rapid filtration than from fine flour. Acetic acid-ethanol method appears to be a simpler extraction procedure than NaOHethanol method as it does not require protein neutralisation. Washing decorticated sorghum and maize meals prior to protein extraction improves protein preparation purity. Sorghum DDGS shows potential as a starting material for kafirin extraction for use in film making, based on high purity and low film water uptake. Heating the films decreases water uptake properties and reduces film digestibility. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. tm 2016 Food ScienceMScUnrestricte...|$|E
