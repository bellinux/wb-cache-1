40|$|This {{document}} {{constitutes the}} final report {{for the study of}} humidity effects and loading rate on soluble core (PVA/MB composite material) mechanical and thermal properties under Contract No. 100345. This report describes test results procedures employed, and any unusual occurrences or specific observations associated with this test program. The primary objective of this work was to determine if cured soluble <b>core</b> <b>filler</b> material regains its tensile and compressive strength after exposure to high humidity conditions and following a drying cycle. Secondary objectives include measurements of tensile and compressive modulus, and Poisson's ratio, and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for various moisture exposure states. A third objective was to compare the mechanical and thermal properties of the composite using 'SG' and 'CG' type extendospheres. The proposed facility for the manufacture of soluble cores at the Yellow Creek site incorporates no capability for the control of humidity. Recent physical property tests performed with the soluble <b>core</b> <b>filler</b> material showed that prolonged exposure to high humidity significantly degradates in strength. The purpose of these tests is to determine if the product, process or facility designs require modification to avoid imparting a high risk condition to the ASRM...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{experimental study}} was undertaken {{to examine the}} suitability of pulsed current {{gas metal arc welding}} of 12 mm thick P 91 steels in groove joint configurations with metal <b>cored</b> <b>filler</b> wire. Both the single and multipass welds showed satisfactory bead morphology, tensile strength and toughness especially at higher groove angles of 60 and 750 for the selected range of welding current and speeds. The weld metal compositions showed considerably high presence of Ni, Mn and Si with little loss of other alloying elements. The weld properties were primarily affected by the heat input per unit length of weld and the groove angle. The maximum ultimate tensile strength and toughness of the welds were found to be around 845 MPa and 125 J, respectively, for a heat input of 1. 38 kJ/mm and a groove angle of 75 degrees. The use of metal <b>cored</b> <b>filler</b> wires could enhance the welding speed by 20 % and filler wire deposition rate by 42 % compared to that with the solid wires. Overall, the present study showed that the pulsed current gas metal arc welding of medium to high thickness P 91 steels using metal <b>cored</b> <b>filler</b> wires could provide higher deposition rate and welding speed, and enhanced weld bead properties in comparison to solid wires.

40|$|International audienceSeveral {{compositions}} {{of metal}} <b>cored</b> <b>filler</b> wire were manufactured {{to define the}} best welding conditions for homogeneous welding, by Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process, of a modified AISI 444 ferritic stainless steel dedicated to automotive exhaust manifold applications. The patented grade is know under APERAM trade name K 44 X and has been developed to present improved high temperature fatigue properties. All filler wires investigated contained 19 %Cr and 1. 8 %Mo, equivalent to the base metal K 44 X chemistry, but various titanium and niobium contents. Chemical analyses and microstructural observations of fusion zones revealed the need of a minimum Ti content of 0. 15 % to obtain a completely equiaxed grain structure. This structure conferred on the fusion zone a good ductility even in the as-welded state at room temperature. Unfortunately, titanium additions decreased the oxidation resistance at 950 °C if no significant Nb complementary alloying was made. The combined high Ti and Nb additions {{made it possible to}} obtain for the welded structure, after optimized heat treatment, high temperature tensile strengths and ductility for the fusion zones and assemblies, rather close to those of the base metal. 950 °C aging heat treatment was necessary to restore significantly the ductility of the as welded structure. Both fusion zone and base metal presented rather homogenized properties. Finally, with the optimized composition of the <b>cored</b> <b>filler</b> wire - 0. 3 Ti minimum (i. e. 0. 15 % in the fusion zone) and high Nb complementary additions, the properties, including the thermal fatigue strength, of the K 44 X assemblies are excellent...|$|R
40|$|This study details a {{fabrication}} methodology envisaged {{to manufacture}} Glass/BMI honeycomb core aerogel-filled sandwich panels. Silica aerogel granules {{are used as}} <b>core</b> <b>fillers</b> to provide thermal insulation properties with little weight increase. Experimental heat transfer studies are conducted on these panels to study the temperature distribution between their two surfaces. Numerical studies are also carried out to validate the results. Despite exhibiting good thermal shielding capabilities, the Glass/BMI sandwich panels are found to oxidise at 180 ºC if exposed directly to heat. In order to increase the temperature bearing capacity and the operating temperature range for these panels, a way of coating them from outside with high temperature spray paint was tried. With a silicone-based coating, the temperature sustainability of these sandwich panels is found to increase to 350 ºC. This proved {{the effectiveness of the}} formed manufacturing process, selected high temperature coating, the coating method as well as the envisaged sandwich panel concept...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeven {{compositions}} {{of metal}} <b>cored</b> <b>filler</b> wires for Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), containing {{the same weight}} percent of chromium (Cr) and molybdenum (Mo) as 444 steel, but with different titanium (Ti) and niobium (Nb) contents were investigated. Experimental results {{pointed out that the}} filler wire Ti content required to be twice time more than the amount expected in the deposited metal. This was due to the low Ti transfer ratio during arc welding. Moreover, Ti increased the wetting angle and promoted penetration. It was supposed that Ti affected the weld pool surface tension what led to inward Marangoni convection. Columnar to equiaxed grain transiton (CET) was also promoted thanks to the precipitation in the weld pool of Ti rich refractory compounds which act as heterogeneous nucleation sites for equiaxed grains. A minimum 0. 3 % Ti was required in the filler wire to form a completely equiaxed grain structure in the fusion zone. Niobium in the filler wire did not seem to have any effect on penetration, wetting and grain structure of the fusion zone...|$|R
40|$|Sandwich {{structures}} are increasingly applied on naval vessels and mega yachts. Considerations {{for the application}} of sandwich {{structures are}} weight reduction, fire insulation, maintenance, RCS reduction and functional combinations, such as radar transparency, aperture incorporation, conformal arrays and ballistic incorporation. At TNO, research into (measures enhancing) the blast, shock, ballistic and fire performance of sandwich panels is ongoing. The work presently reported focuses on the validation of a number of failure models for blast loaded sandwich panels fitted into steel joints. Typical failure modes for these constructions are: failure of the adhesive bond between steel and sandwich, core failure (see Fig. 1), delamination and in-plane (compression) failure of the FRP facings (see also Fig. 2). The failure models for delamination, adhesive bond failure and foam <b>core</b> or <b>filler</b> material failure were developed at TNO over the past decade and form together the so-called failure prediction tool, or FPT. The FPT was implemented in the explicit finite element code LS-Dyna. These models were extensively validated for underwater shock [1]...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation conducted to improve the weather resistance of plywood assemblies used in prefabricated housing manufacture. Specifically, this work involved water sealers for edge joints (called edge sealers), the prevention of surface transfer of water vapor through plywood (called vapor barriers), and fillers for structural defects in the wood (called <b>core</b> void <b>fillers).</b> Two edge sealers for plywood were developed that were considered successful in resisting water permeation. One was a quick drying paint formulated by the addition of 30 per cent leaded zinc oxide to 70 per cent Arco primer paint No. 156. However, a better but slower drying sealer was found in the use of two coats of 40 per cent leaded zinc oxide and 60 per cent glyceryl phthalate varnish. Two vapor barriers were developed that were successful in combatting moisture condensation in the stud space of exterior wall assemblies. One of these was an aluminum-gilsonite paint. The other was an aluminum foil bonded to the plywood. Either would reduce the moisture diffusion through wood in excess of 95 per cent. A method is presented that would make the use of aluminum foil economically feasible. A <b>filler</b> for <b>core</b> voids consisting of an asbestos extended resoreinol glue mixture was developed. The filler showed optimum resistance to weather conditions, heat and water bleeding, and had an excellent pot life...|$|R
5000|$|For {{dowel bar}} retrofit, dowels, bond breaker, {{expansion}} caps, dowel bar support chairs, foam <b>core</b> insert, caulking <b>filler,</b> non-shrink concrete backfill material and submittals are needed. The dowels {{need to be}} smooth, round, epoxy and made of bond breaker coated steel conforming to requirements. The bond breaker {{is to be applied}} on all surfaces of the dowel bar. The expansion caps belong {{at each end of the}} dowel bar and the dowel bar support chairs are used to firmly hold the dowels centered in the slots during backfill operations. The foam core insert is used to re-establish the joint or crack, which allows the bar within each side of the slot to expand and contract. The caulking filler is used to prevent backfill material from flowing into the joint or crack. Non-shrink concrete backfill material that is tested as rapid set concrete patching materials is recommended for use on DBR projects.|$|R
40|$|Wear and {{corrosion}} are severe {{problems in}} gas and diesel engine components {{and to prevent}} these problems, number of solutions are available. In this thesis one of the possible solutions, cladding of engine components is studied with a state-of-the-art welding process, Cold Metal Transfer. CMT is a rather new and cost-effective method of welding and cladding with a limited heat input and a large variety of available materials. During this thesis, {{a great number of}} cladding tests with different cobalt-base alloy filler materials on different metallic base materials were run. These tests aimed to optimize the cladding parameters for a <b>cored</b> Co-alloy <b>filler</b> wire. Another region of interest was to optimize the tribological properties of the coatings in order to reduce friction coefficient and increase the wear resistance of the components. In this thesis, a powder feeder was used to spray particles into the melt pool during cladding. It was discovered that CMT is able to restrain problems traditional overlay welding pro-cesses exhibit: high heat input resulting in unwanted changes of the base material, which also leads to high dilution and large amount of spattering during the process. The to-and-fro movement of the filler wire reduces the heat input and the precise process control with mechanical droplet detachment reduces the amount of spattering greatly. The CMT-process optimization was successful for Co-base filler wire, and optimal param-eters were achieved by cladding tests and analyzation of the results. The optimization resulted in low-diluted (< 5 %) Stellite-coating (450 - 500 HV 1) with a proper fusion bond and a narrow Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) ...|$|R
40|$|Decreasing {{the carbon}} {{footprint}} {{through use of}} renewable materials has environmental and societal impact. Foams are a valuable constituent in buildings by themselves or as a core in sandwich composites. Kenaf is a Southeast USA plant that provides renewable <b>filler.</b> The <b>core</b> of the kenaf is porous with a cell size in a 5 - 10 micrometer range. The use of kenaf core in foams represents a novel multiscalar cellular structural composite. Rigid polyurethane foams were made using free foaming expansion with kenaf <b>core</b> as <b>filler</b> with loadings of 5, 10 and 15 %. Free foaming was found to negatively affect the mechanical properties. An innovative process was developed to introduce a constraint to expansion during foaming. Two expansion ratios were examined: 40 and 60 % (decreasing expansion ratio). MicroCT and SEM analysis showed a varying structure of open and closed cell pores. The mechanical, thermal insulation, acoustic properties were measured. Pure PU foam showed improved cell size uniformity. Introducing kenaf core resulted in decreasing the PU performance in the free expansion case. This was reversed by introducing constraints. To understand the combined impact of having a mixed close cell and open cell architecture, finite element modeling was done using ANSYS. Models were created with varying percentages of open, closed, and bulk cells to encompass entire range of foam porosities. Net zero energy building information modelling was conducted using EnergyPlus was conducted using natural fiber composite skins. Environmental impacts for instance global warming potential, acidification, eutrophication, fossil fuel consumption, ozone depletion, and smog potential of the materials used in construction was studied using life cycle assessment. The results showed improvement on energy consumption and carbon footprint...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective This study {{evaluated}} the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth restored with {{fiber reinforced composite}} posts, using three resin composite core build-up materials, (Clearfil Photo Core (CPC), MultiCore Flow (MCF), and LuxaCore Z-Dual (LCZ)), and a nanohybrid composite, (Tetric N-Ceram (TNC)). Material and Methods Forty endodontically treated lower first premolars were restored with quartz fiber posts (D. T. Light-Post) cemented with resin cement (Panavia F 2. 0). Samples were randomly divided into four groups (n= 10). Each group was built-up {{with one of the}} four core materials following its manufacturers’ instructions. The teeth were embedded in acrylic resin blocks. Nickel-Chromium crowns were fixed on the specimens with resin cement. The fracture resistance was determined using a universal testing machine with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min at 1350 to the tooth axis until failure occurred. All core materials used in the study were subjected to test for the flexural modulus according to ISO 4049 : 2009. Results One-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparisons test indicated that the fracture resistance was higher in the groups with CPC and MCF, which presented no statistically significant difference (p> 0. 05), but was significantly higher than in those with LCZ and TNC (p< 0. 05). In terms of the flexural modulus, the ranking from the highest values of the materials was aligned with the same tendency of fracture loads. Conclusion Among the cores used in this study, the composite <b>core</b> with high <b>filler</b> content tended to enhance fracture thresholds of teeth restored with fiber posts more than others...|$|R
40|$|In its {{deployment}} as {{a pebble}} bed reactor (PBR) critical facility from 1992 to 1996, the PROTEUS facility was designated as HTR-PROTEUS. This experimental program was performed {{as part of}} an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Coordinated Research Project (CRP) on the Validation of Safety Related Physics Calculations for Low Enriched HTGRs. Within this project, critical experiments were conducted for graphite moderated LEU systems to determine core reactivity, flux and power profiles, reaction-rate ratios, the worth of control rods, both in-core and reflector based, the worth of burnable poisons, kinetic parameters, and the effects of moisture ingress on these parameters. One benchmark experiment was evaluated in this report: Core 4. Core 4 represents the only configuration with random pebble packing in the HTR-PROTEUS series of experiments, and has a moderator-to-fuel pebble ratio of 1 : 1. Three random configurations were performed. The initial configuration, Core 4. 1, was rejected because the method for pebble loading, separate delivery tubes for the moderator and fuel pebbles, may not have been completely random; this core loading was rejected by the experimenters. Cores 4. 2 and 4. 3 were loaded using a single delivery tube, eliminating the possibility for systematic ordering effects. The second and third cores differed slightly in the quantity of pebbles loaded (40 each of moderator and fuel pebbles), stacked height of the pebbles in the core cavity (0. 02 m), withdrawn distance of the stainless steel control rods (20 mm), and withdrawn distance of the autorod (30 mm). The 34 coolant channels in the upper axial reflector and the 33 coolant channels in the lower axial reflector were open. Additionally, the axial graphite fillers used in all other HTR-PROTEUS configurations to create a 12 -sided core cavity were not used in the randomly packed <b>cores.</b> Instead, graphite <b>fillers</b> were placed on the cavity floor, creating a funnel-like base, to discourage ordering effects during pebble loading. Core 4 was determined to be acceptable benchmark experiment...|$|R
