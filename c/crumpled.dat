5|$|Geologically the Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{was once}} {{part of a large}} and shallow sea that covered most of southern California. As the San Joaquin Hills rose and river sediments were deposited, land gradually emerged to form the present-day Orange County coast. Sulphur Creek is located in a <b>crumpled,</b> hilly area {{in the southern part of}} this range, formed differently from the continuous mountain chain to the north. Historically, being south of Aliso Creek, the Sulphur Creek watershed was part of the territory of the semi-nomadic Acjachemen Indian group, conquered by Spanish conquistadors in the 17th and 18th centuries and renamed the Juaneño by them.|$|E
5|$|Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL {{who participated}} in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which {{significantly}} contradicts Pfarrer's account. Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version. According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him {{on the right side of}} the head. Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom, where the SEALs found him <b>crumpled</b> and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot bin Laden repeatedly in the chest until he was dead. According to Bissonnette, the weapons in the room—an AK-47 rifle and a Makarov pistol—were unloaded.|$|E

As a sophomore, <b>Crumpler</b> caught 24 passes for a total of 278 yards, with four of those catches being touchdowns. In his junior season, <b>Crumpler</b> had 20 catches for 191 yards. His senior season concluded with him amassing 23 catches for 287 yards and one touchdown and he finished second in All-American voting.|$|R
5|$|The idea of Jesse riding go-karts {{by himself}} to relax was {{inspired}} by Aaron Paul and other crew members who often went kart racing between filming of Breaking Bad episodes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During one of the party scenes at Jesse's house, Jesse keeps throwing <b>crumpled</b> dollar bills {{at the mouth of}} a sleeping man wearing a dress shirt and tie with no pants until he finally gets one inside his mouth. Catlin thought of the idea, and it was property master Trina Siopy actually throwing the bills off-screen; she got one into the actor's mouth on her second try. The scenes in Jesse's house were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy.|$|E

[...] The high compressive strength exhibited by dense <b>crumple</b> formed cellulose paper is of interest towards impact dissipation applications and has been proposed as an approach to utilising waste paper.|$|R
50|$|A {{misconception}} about <b>crumple</b> zones sometimes voiced is {{that they}} reduce safety for the occupants of the vehicle by allowing the body to collapse, therefore risking crushing the occupants. In fact, <b>crumple</b> zones are typically located in front of and behind {{the main body of}} the car (which forms a rigid 'safety cell'), compacting within the space of the engine compartment or boot/trunk. Modern vehicles using what are commonly termed 'crumple zones' provide far superior protection for their occupants in severe tests against other vehicles with <b>crumple</b> zones and solid static objects than older models or SUVs that use a separate chassis frame and have no <b>crumple</b> zones.|$|R

40|$|We {{find that}} in two {{dimensions}} wires can <b>crumple</b> into different morphologies and present the associated morphological phase diagram. Our results are based on experiments with different metallic wires and confirmed by numerical simulations using a discrete element model. We show that during <b>crumpling,</b> the number of loops increases according to a power-law with different exponents in each morphology. Furthermore, we observe a power-law divergence of the structure's bulk stiffness similar to what is observed in forced <b>crumpling</b> of membranes...|$|R

The fans booed on cue. Hopkins used the full five minutes to recuperate.|$|E
25|$|For {{incidentally}} discovered dermoids, diagnosed on ultrasound {{by their}} pathognomonic echogenic fat, either surgical removal or yearly follow up is indicated, regardless of patient age. For peritoneal inclusion cysts, {{which have a}} <b>crumpled</b> tissue-paper appearance and tend to follow the contour of adjacent organs, follow up is based on clinical history. Hydrosalpinx, or fallopian tube dilation, can be mistaken for an ovarian cyst due to its anechoic appearance. Follow-up for this is also based on clinical presentation.|$|E
50|$|They {{do tend to}} {{come off}} worse when {{involved}} in accidents with SUVs without <b>crumple</b> zones {{because most of the}} energy of the impact is absorbed by the vehicle with the <b>crumple</b> zone — however, even for the occupants of the 'worse off' car, this will still often be an improvement — as the result of two vehicles without <b>crumple</b> zones colliding will usually be more hazardous to both vehicle's occupants than a collision that is at least partly buffered.|$|R

25|$|The topological {{dependence}} of mechanical properties in solids {{is of interest}} in disciplines of mechanical engineering and materials science.

25|$|Originally {{the nozzle}} {{protruded}} from the back, but this {{turned out to}} be aerodynamically disadvantageous. In June 2004, between flights 14P and 15P, a fairing was added, smoothly extending the fuselage shape to meet the flared end of the nozzle. On flight 15P the new fairing overheated, due to being black on the inside and facing a hot, black nozzle. The fairing softened, and the lower part <b>crumpled</b> inwards during boost. Following that flight the interior of the fairing was painted white, and some small stiffening ribs were added.|$|E

25|$|Most early landscapes {{are clearly}} imaginary, {{although}} from {{very early on}} townscape views are clearly intended to represent actual cities, {{with varying degrees of}} accuracy. Various techniques were used to simulate the randomness of natural forms in invented compositions: the medieval advice of Cennino Cennini to copy ragged crags from small rough rocks was apparently followed by both Poussin and Thomas Gainsborough, while Degas copied cloud forms from a <b>crumpled</b> handkerchief held up against the light. The system of Alexander Cozens used random ink blots to give the basic shape of an invented landscape, to be elaborated by the artist.|$|E
