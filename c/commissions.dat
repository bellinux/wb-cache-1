40|$|Does the European <b>Commission</b> (<b>Commission)</b> {{manage to}} {{transform}} and re-direct the roles played by <b>Commission</b> civil servants? To test the old neo-functionalist claim on loyalty transfer among civil servants, {{this article provides}} fresh survey and interview data on seconded national experts in the <b>Commission.</b> The transformative powers of the <b>Commission</b> are tested by assessing {{the extent to which}} seconded national experts adopt supranational role perceptions. Theoretically, the emergence of supranational role perceptions is accounted for by considering (i) processes of pre-socialisation outside the <b>Commission,</b> (ii) processes of resocialisation inside the <b>Commission,</b> and (iii) organisational incompatibility between the <b>Commission</b> and domestic ministries and agencies from which the secondees originate. The empirical analysis shows that secondees evoke multiple loyalties, notably towards own profession, own DG and Unit and towards the EU and the <b>Commission</b> as wholes. Crucially, the data reported demonstrate that the <b>Commission</b> indeed instils supranational role perceptions into secondees. This observation reflects processes of re-socialisation inside the <b>Commission,</b> the organisational composition of the <b>Commission</b> as well as organizational incompatibilities between the <b>Commission</b> and domestic ministries and agencies. The data does not report robust evidence of pre-socialisation outside the <b>Commission.</b> Hence, the <b>Commission</b> is indeed a ‘hothouse for supranationalism’...|$|R

5|$|Any Croatian citizen {{over age}} 18 {{may be a}} {{candidate}} in presidential, parliamentary or local government elections, provided that {{a sufficient number of}} endorsements by Croatian voters is obtained beforehand. Croatian elections are relatively well-regulated; regulations include spending limits, annual donation limits, a limitation on the number of endorsed candidates and election lists and regulations governing media coverage. Voting takes place in polling stations in Croatia and abroad, monitored by an electoral board and observers at each station. Ballots consist of an alphabetical list of candidates, or an election list with ordinal numbers (which are circled to indicate a vote). All votes are counted by hand. The State Electoral Commission publishes official results and handles complaints, supported by county, city and town electoral <b>commissions</b> during local elections.

5|$|Cairano's career covers {{just over}} two decades (circa 1490–1510), a {{relatively}} short period, during which, moreover, the majority of works produced is concentrated in the latter decade.

Numerous sculptures also stemmed from private <b>commissions,</b> especially funerary tombs, as well as secular cycles such as that of the Caesars. In many works, there is an evident, and sometimes overwhelming architectural component that indicates the careful preparations made by Cairano in this field. Cairano was lauded, as for example by the municipality of Chiari where he was explicitly named lapicida architectum et ingeniarum optimum.|$|E
5|$|Coffin's {{attempts}} to find business in the Midwest were thwarted by the well-established presence there of several notable landscape architects in Chicago {{but she was not}} short of <b>commissions</b> despite this failure.

Her work was widely featured in popular magazines and professional journals, at Coffin's own instigation as part of an overt marketing strategy. She sought to reach the wealthy and powerful women who made up an important part of the readership of publications such as the Garden Club of America's Bulletin. Coffin commissioned some of America's leading landscape photographers to take photographs of her creations and promoted her work through slide lectures.
