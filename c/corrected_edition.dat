5|$|During the 1650s, Ashmole {{devoted a}} great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650, he {{published}} Fasciculus Chemicus under the anagrammatic pseudonym James Hasolle. This work was an English translation of two Latin alchemical works, one by Arthur Dee, the son of John Dee. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in privately held manuscripts. A <b>corrected</b> <b>edition</b> using Ashmole's two errata sheets and the additional chapter seven of a piece by Thomas Charnock was published in 2011. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He {{appears to have been a}} collector of alchemical writings and a student of alchemy rather than an active practitioner, and refers to himself as a pupil of William Backhouse. His final alchemical publication was The Way to Bliss in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits. Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both Galenic and Paracelsian principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. The Way to Bliss recommends ways to prevent illness: a balanced diet, moderate exercise and enough sleep. His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as Isaac Newton.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} {{status of the}} Clementine Vulgate and the mass of manuscript material discouraged {{the creation of a}} critical edition of the Vulgate. In 1734 Vallarsi published a <b>corrected</b> <b>edition</b> of the Vulgate. Most other later editions were limited to the New Testament and did not present a full critical apparatus, most notably Karl Lachmann's editions of 1842 and 1850 based primarily on the Codex Amiatinus and Codex Fuldensis, Fleck's edition of 1840, and Constantin von Tischendorf's edition of 1864. In 1906 Eberhard Nestle published Novum Testamentum Latine, which presented the Clementine Vulgate text with a critical apparatus comparing it to the editions of Sixtus V (1590), Lachman (1842), Tischendorf (1854), and Wordsworth and White (1889), as well as the Codex Amiatinus and Codex Fuldensis.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{invention}} of the printing press, the editio princeps of the Astronomica was published in Nuremberg around 1473 by the astronomer Regiomontanus from an error-riddled Italian copy. The text was then critically edited by Joseph Justus Scaliger, whose first edition was published in Paris in 1579; a second and improved edition, collated at least partially from the Codex Gemblacensis, was published in Leiden in 15991600, and a third edition was published in 1655 after Scaliger's death by Johann Heinrich Boeckler. An updated edition was published by Richard Bentley in 1739. Then, in five volumes between 1903 and 1930, Housman published what is considered by many scholars the authoritative edition of the poem (with an additional editio minor in 1932). According to Volk, [...] " [...] work is famoussome might say notoriousfor its bold handling of the text, its incisive commentary, and its merciless ... invective against other scholars." [...] In 1977, G. P. Goold published a Loeb English translation, collated both from manuscript M and from photographs of various manuscripts which had once belonged to Housman; this release marked {{the first time that the}} poem had been translated into English prose (the first book of the Astronomica had previously been translated into English by Edward Sherburne in 1674, and Thomas Creech had translated the entire poem into English verse in 1697). Goold's translation (complete with substantial introductory notes and diagrams) was called [...] "masterly" [...] by Volk and Steven Green, both of whom argued that it [...] "marked a significant development in the accessibility of Manilius to a larger audience". Goold later issued a second edition of his translation in 1992, as well as a <b>corrected</b> <b>edition</b> in 1997 that included information from W. S. Watt's article [...] "Maniliana".|$|E

50|$|Paulus was {{a passionate}} Ciceronian, and perhaps his chief {{contributions}} to scholarship are the <b>corrected</b> <b>editions</b> of Cicero's letters and orations (Epistolae ad familiares in 1540, Epistolae ad Atticum and Epistolae ad Marcum Iunium Brutum et ad Quintum Ciceronem fratrem in 1547), his own epistles in a Ciceronian style, and his Latin version of Demosthenes' Philippics (Demosthenis orationes quattuor contra Philippum, 1549). Throughout {{his life he}} combined the occupations of a scholar and a printer. As a scholar he is remembered for four elegant Latin treatises on Roman antiquities. His <b>correct</b> <b>editions</b> of the classics, printed in a splendid style, were highly esteemed, yet sales did not always support such productions; in 1556 he received for a time external support from the Venetian Academy founded by Federigo Badoaro.

2500|$|In {{consequence}} of the continual disputes over printing privileges, successive printings of the Authorized Version were notably less careful than the 1611 edition had been – compositors freely varying spelling, capitalization and punctuation – and also, over the years, introducing about 1,500 misprints (some of which, like the omission of [...] "not" [...] from the commandment [...] "Thou shalt not commit adultery" [...] in the [...] "Wicked Bible", became notorious). The two Cambridge editions of 1629 and 1638 attempted to restore the proper text – while introducing over 200 revisions of the original translators' work, chiefly by incorporating into the main text a more literal reading originally presented as a marginal note. A more thoroughly <b>corrected</b> <b>edition</b> was proposed following the Restoration, {{in conjunction with the}} revised 1662 Book of Common Prayer, but Parliament then decided against it.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{university}} Pâquet taught {{a number of}} classes, and became dean of the faculty of theology in 1871, a position he'd maintain until 1879. His last five lectures in his 1871-1872 laws of the nations course specifically discussed the explosive topic of liberalism. In them, he refuted the most radical form based on the arguments from various papal teachings, revealing himself a moderate ultramontane and carefully avoiding to touch the more troublesome local aspects (the rise of the Liberal Party of Canada, which its opponents saw as [...] "an anti-catholic party"), primarily because [...] "the term {{did not have the}} same meaning [...] as in Europe." [...] These teachings were seen by all as displaying [...] "bulletproof orthodoxy", which didn't keep Pelletier from denouncing them on his own alone in newspapers and a pamphlet. These attacks proved fruitless, and the text was hailed in La Civiltà Cattolica as [...] "the most faithful echo of Roman doctrines." [...] A revised and <b>corrected</b> <b>edition</b> was issued in 1877 in Rome.|$|E
2500|$|After Gerard's {{death in}} 1612, an enlarged, revised and <b>corrected</b> <b>edition</b> of the Herball was issued in 1633 and reprinted {{as a third}} edition in 1636. These editions were edited by Thomas Johnson, an apothecary and {{botanist}} who lived in London, under commission from the heirs to the estate of John Gerard. His edition contained many corrections and new information based on empirical observation. He added over 800 new species and 700 figures. Through anecdotal comments, Johnson carefully distanced himself from the original work. For example, he wrote of the entry on the saffron crocus, [...] "Our author in this chapter was of many minds." [...] The plant drawings in the 1633 and 1636 editions used hundreds of woodblocks originally made for an edition of Rembert Dodoens's original herbal, the basis of Gerard's work. The woodblocks were shipped from Antwerp to London for the purpose. Johnson's revisions are the most well known versions {{and the ones that}} most later authors generally refer to, sometimes called Gerard emaculatus ("Gerard freed from blemishes"). Long attributed to John Ray, this description is thought to have been used earlier by John Goodyer amongst others.|$|E

2500|$|Flavianus {{belonged to}} the Nicomachi, an {{influential}} family of senatorial rank. His father was the pagan politician and historian Virius Nicomachus Flavianus, and had a brother. He married Galla, daughter of Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, from whom he received several letters and whose family had a long-time friendship and alliance with the Nicomachi; [...] it was probably in occasion of Flavianus' wedding that the [...] "Nicomachorum-Symmachorum" [...] diptych was produced. As tradition for his family, he was patron of Naples, and, sharing a common interest in his family, he edited works of pagan authors of the Roman literature: in particular, around 408 he produced a <b>corrected</b> <b>edition</b> the first ten books of the Ab Urbe condita of Livy, while he was staying near Enna (he had estates in Sicily). His edition had been corrected by Victorinus before him, then bought by Symmachus, and finally, after Flavianus' edition, emended another time by his nephew Appius Nicomachus Dexter; all of the manuscripts of the first ten books of Livy's Ab Urbe condita that were subsequently copied through the Middle Ages into modern times are derived by this single manuscript, thanks to whom those books have survived.|$|E
