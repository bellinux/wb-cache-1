Evidence suggests that usage of a <b>lid</b> <b>clamp</b> and absorbable sutures would result in reduced lid contour abnormalities and granuloma formulation post-surgery. Early intervention is beneficial as the rate of recurrence is higher in more advanced disease.|$|R

5000|$|Because of Kelly's {{commitments}} to other film projects, production was delayed for a while, {{and it did}} not begin until 1953. Minnelli and Kelly considered shooting the film on location in Scotland, but due to its unpredictable climate, high production costs, and MGM President Dore Schary's eagerness of films being made on a low budget, the idea was canned. Kelly and producer Arthur Freed traveled to Scotland to confirm for themselves if the weather was too unreliable, and they agreed with the studio. In Kelly's biography it was stated that [...] "the weather was so bad that we had to agree with the studio. So we came back to the United States and started looking for locations here. We found some highlands above Monterey Big Sur that looked like Scotland. But then the studio had an economy wave, and they <b>clamped</b> the <b>lid</b> on that idea." [...] Much to the disappointment of the cast and crew and the delight of Dore Schary, filming had to take place on the sound stages at MGM instead.|$|R

During this time he also invented a <b>lid</b> <b>clamp</b> for wooden egg cases, which became [...] "the first of {{a long line of}} products completely designed and fabricated in our factory."

40|$|Dr. Parrish {{states that}} with {{influenza}} ban removed {{the public is}} not observing even basic precautions. If conditions do not improve strict regulations may be put back in place. • Dr. Parrish: “Since the closing order was taken off two weeks ago {{there has been no}} change for the better in the influenza epidemic. This means that we have not made the improvement expected of us at that time. The order was removed only after all reports had shown that the cases and deaths were on the decrease. If individuals and doctors in attendance had observed proper precautions in caring for and isolating cases the epidemic would gradually have faded away. We put the responsibility on the individual when we lifted the ban. In order to make people observe a few common sense health rules and to keep them aware of the danger that lies in the disease we may have to <b>clamp</b> the <b>lid</b> on again and put it on tight. It has been the case in many cities, but I believed that Portlanders had been educated to the dangers of the disease. Evidently they have not, and so it may again be necessary to plunge the city into gloom, both economic and social. ”• There are 75 patients at the emergency hospital. This number is an increase of 50 % over the number of patients last week. It “is believed to presage a return of the epidemic. ”• All of the hospitals in the city are filled – with influenza and other cases. Some rooms are available but nurses and attendants are scarce. • The plans to close the Auditorium this week are cancelled. It is believed that the building will not be returned to its usual use for another two weeks, at least. • There is a recurrence of influenza in Seattle and it is seen as a warning for Portland because Portland’s epidemic is approximately one week behind Seattle’s.
