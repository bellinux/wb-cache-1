40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Randomized {{clinical}} trial. OBJECTIVES: To {{analyze the}} immediate treatment effects of cervical mobilization and therapeutic ultrasound {{in patients with}} neurogenic <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain.</b> BACKGROUND: Different treatment modalities have been described for patients with neurogenic <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain.</b> Although {{it has been suggested}} that a more specific approach, like cervical mobilization, would be more effective, effect studies are scarce. METHODS AND MEASURES: Twenty patients with subacute peripheral neurogenic <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> were assessed. Besides other criteria, patients were included if a cervical segmental motion restriction was present which could be regarded as a possible cause of the neurogenic disorder. Patients were randomly assigned to a mobilization or ultrasound group. Mobilization consisted of a contralateral lateral glide technique. The range of elbow extension, symptom distribution, and pain intensity during the neural tissue provocation test for the median nerve were used as outcome measures. Results were analyzed using a 2 -way mixed-design ANOVA. RESULTS: Significant differences in treatment effects between the 2 groups could be observed for all outcome measures (P or =. 0521). CONCLUSIONS: When a cervical dysfunction can be regarded as a cause of the neurogenic disorder or as a contributing factor that impedes natural recovery, a cervical lateral glide mobilization has positive immediate effects in patients with subacute peripheral neurogenic <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain.</b> This movement-based approach seems preferable to ultrasound. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> is {{a painful}} {{condition}} which, when chronic, {{might lead to}} high levels of disability. Limited data from small studies have reported that the lateral glide mobilisation is effective on reducing pain in the short-term. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} establish whether the lateral glide mobilisation technique was effective in reducing pain in the long-term. Methods Literature reviews on <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> provided the rational to conduct a phase III trial. An audit and a preliminary study were used to inform methods for the trial. A single-centre randomised clinical trial was conducted on participants with chronic <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain.</b> Participants were randomised to receive either the lateral glide with self-management or self-management alone. The trial was powered to detect a between group difference of 20 mm on worst pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) at 52 weeks follow-up. Results Ninety-nine participants were recruited to the trial. There was a non-significant between-group difference for mean VAS(worst pain) scores at 52 week follow-up (p= 0. 52; 95...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Background: Efficacy of {{epidural}} {{local anesthetics}} plus steroids {{for the treatment}} of <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> is uncertain. Methods: A prospective study randomized 160 patients with <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> resistant to conventional therapy. Patients were divided into 4 groups {{on the basis of the}} time between pain onset and treatment initiation: group A, 40 patients with pain onset 15 to 30 days; group B, 40 patients with pain from 31 to 60 days; group C, 40 patients, 61 to 180 days; and group D, 40 patients with pain > 180 days. Patients of each group were randomized to receive an epidural block with bupivacaine and methylprednisolone at intervals of 4 to 5 days (Single ii#cction) or continuous epidural bupivacame every 6, 12, or 24 hours plus methylprednisolone every 4 to 5 days (Continitos epidural). The maximum duration of treatment (9 blocks in Single injection, and 30 days in Contintios epidural) was dependent on achieving Pain Control (PC) > 80 % [PC is defined by this formulae: (100) (VAS(intial), - VASfi,,. 1) /VASinitia 1]. Follow-up at I rilonth and 6 Months compared PC and the number of pain-free hours of sleep. Results: One hundred forty-one patients completed the study. The 4 groups had similar characteristics. At the 1 -month and 6 -month follow-up analysis based on the time between pain onset and treatment initiation showed that patients of group D, who received the Continuous epidural treatment, had significantly greater PC and significantly more pain-free hours of sleep compared with similar patients in Single injection. Conclusions: Therapy with continuous epidural local anesthetic and methylprednisolone provides better control of chronic <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> compared with Single injcction.

40|$|Deep Oscillation® is an {{apparatus}} that produces low frequency electromagnetic radiations able to modulate immune reactions and, therefore, applicable to pain, tumour and inflammation treatments. The {{aim of this}} study is to evaluate how the Deep Oscillation® therapy works on conventional therapy resistant patients as the apparatus can be applied either to trauma derived fom surgical wounds or on sports post-traumatic oedema, low back pain and/or sciatalgic pain and <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain.</b> METHODS:In the first part of the study, 34 cases of recent surgical wounds have been treated with Deep Oscillation® with 3 times a week visits for 20 minutes. In the same way 30 cases of sports post-traumatic oedema, 20 cases of low back pain and/or sciatalgic pain and 10 cases of <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> were treated. Among these patients, 15 cases had also undergone contemporaneous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs intravenous drip, electrolytes and vitamins to verify the probable synergetic efficacy of both treatments. RESULTS:The results confirm that in some cases the Deep Oscillation® treatment is effective since the first/third therapy up to the restitutio ad integrum. It has also been demonstrated that the maximum efficiency of the Deep Oscillation® and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs synergetic treatment is probably due to the electromagnetic radiations able to facilitate the pharmacological uptake. CONCLUSION:This study confirms the capacity of the electrostatic energy, released by Deep Oscillation®, to stimulate the patient's neurosensory system, raising his pain threshold and facilitating his pharmacological uptake and restoring his functional recovery more quickl...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chronic {{shoulder}} and neck pain {{is a very}} common and costly condition, for which manipulative physiotherapy is frequently recommended, although evidence to support its use is limited. This study examined {{the effectiveness of a}} scheme of manipulative physiotherapy examination and treatment in the management of a subject with neurogenic <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain.</b> Methods: A single case study ABC design was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} manipulative physiotherapy. The patient was a 44 -year old woman with an eight-month history of left-sided neurogenic <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain.</b> Clinical examination demonstrated signs of upper quadrant neural tissue mechanosensitivity suggesting that neural tissue was the origin of the subject's complaint of pain. Corroborative magnetic resonance imaging verified that the cause for the patient's radicular signs and symptoms was discal pathology at the C 5 / 6 intersegmental level. The study involved three phases Phase A was a four-week pre-assessment phase; Phase B was a four-week treatment phase; Phase C was a two-week home exercise phase. Before phase A and at the end of each phase the patient's function (Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire), pain (Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire or SF-MPQ) and cervical and left shoulder abduction range of motion were measured. Manipulative physiotherapy treatment consisted of a lateral glide mobilisation technique of C 5 on C 6 towards the right side, performed by a physiotherapist with a postgraduate qualification in manipulative physiotherapy. Treatment was 3 sessions per week for 2 weeks and 2 sessions per week for 2 weeks. The two-week home exercise phase consisted of the patient performing an active cervical right side flexion movement. Results: From the end of Phase A to the 1 month follow-up there was a 42 % improvement in functional disability; there was a 70 % reduction in pain level recorded in the VAS aspect of the SF-MPQ; shoulder abduction increased from 280 to 1400 and cervical right side flexion increased from 180 to 520. Because of the controversy regarding performing statistical tests on single case studies, and because there was obvious clinical improvement, no statistical tests were performed on the results. Conclusion: This treatment protocol produced beneficial effects on functional disability, pain and cervical and shoulder mobility in a patient with chronic <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain.</b> These improvements were maintained until a one-month follow-up. The single case design of the study limits generalisation of the findings, but the results give further impetus for a clinical trial...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of surgery, physiotherapy or a cervical collar {{in the treatment}} of chronic <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> of radicular origin was evaluated in a prospective, randomised study comprising 81 patients of both sexes, 28 - 64 years of age, referred for possible neurosurgical treatment. After neurological and radiological examination and giving their informed consent, they were randomised to one of the three treatments. The surgery group underwent anterior decompression and single level fusion by bovine graft. The conservatively treated groups received individual physiotherapy or a rigid cervical collar for three months. The effects were evaluated at three months and 12 months later with respect to pain, tender points, sensory disturbance, muscle strength, neck and shoulder joint mobility, postural control, mood and health status. All treated groups improved, although the improvement rate differed. The surgically treated group was significantly better at three months, but one year later, {{there was no significant difference}} between the three groups. The studies variables also included the patients? balance in comparison with a healthy control group and the occurrence of headache. Before treatment, the patients manifested significantly poorer postural control than sex and age- matched controls. Three months after treatment the surgery group showed a significantly improved postural performance and the collar group showed the poorest. Forty-nine of the 81 patients were classified as having cervical headache and 24 of these reported that their headache had improved at the three months? control. Patients with cervical headache reported significantly more <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> and higher tenderness score than patients with cervical radiculopathy with no headache. No one-year follow-up was performed concerning balance and headache. It may be concluded that pain intensity, sensory disturbance, muscle strength and health status can be expected to improve most rapidly after surgery, but a slow improvement with conservative treatments makes the one-year results about equal...|$|E
40|$|Self-report data on {{musculoskeletal}} discomfort {{were collected}} from several hun-dred VDT users in two agencies of a state government. Aspects of worker posture and workstation design were objectively assessed for 40 of the VDT users. Multiple regression analyses were {{used to examine the}} relationship between these ergo-nomic variables and musculoskeletal discomfort. Effects of ergonomic factors on musculoskeletal discomfort were clearly evident in the analyses. Regression mod-els explained up to 38 % of the variance in discomfort at different body sites. Of special interest was that leg discomfort increased with low, soft seat pans, sug-gesting that postural constraint is more important than thigh compression as a risk factor for leg discomfort in VDT work. In addition, arm discomfort increased with increases in keyboard height above elbow level, supporting arguments for low placement of the keyboard. Finally, high levels of neck and shoulder girdle dis-comfort observed in the study population suggest the need for further attention to the control of <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> syndromes in VDT work...|$|E
40|$|A {{single case}} study ABC design {{was used to}} {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of manipulative physiotherapy in a 44 -year-old woman with an 8 -month history of neurogenic <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain.</b> Clinical examination demonstrated significant signs of upper quadrant neural tissue mechanosensitivity indicating that neural tissue was the dominant tissue of origin for the subject's complaint of pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed correlating discal pathology at the C 5 / 6 intersegmental level. The study involved a 4 -week pre-assessment phase, a 4 -week treatment phase and a 2 -week home exercise phase. Functional disability was measured using the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire and pain was assessed using the McGill Short Form Pain Questionnaire. Cervical motion was measured by a cervical range of motion device (CROM) and the range of shoulder abduction with a mediclino inclinometer. Manipulative physiotherapy treatment involved a cervical lateral glide mobilization technique. Following treatment, visual analysis revealed beneficial effects on pain, functional disability as well as cervical and shoulder mobility. These improvements were maintained over the home exercise phase and at 1 -month follow-up. The single case limits generalization of the findings, but the results support previous studies in this area and gives further impetus to controlled clinical trials. <br/...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Observation of the {{occurrence}} of protective muscle activity is advocated in assessment of the peripheral nervous system by means of neural provocation tests. However, no studies have yet demonstrated abnormal force generation in a patient population. OBJECTIVES: To analyze whether aberrations in shoulder girdle-elevation force during neural tissue provocation testing for the median nerve (NTPT 1) can be demonstrated, and whether possible aberrations can be normalized following cervical mobilization. STUDY DESIGN: A single-blind randomized comparative controlled study. SETTING: Laboratory setting annex in a manual therapy teaching practice. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty patients with unilateral or bilateral neurogenic <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain.</b> METHODS: During the NTPT 1, we used a load cell and electrogoniometer to record continuously the shoulder-girdle elevation force {{in relation to the}} available range of elbow extension. Following randomization, we analyzed the immediate treatment effects of a cervical contralateral lateral glide mobilization technique (experimental group) and therapeutic ultrasound (control group). RESULTS: On the involved side, the shoulder-girdle elevation force occurred earlier, and the amount of force {{at the end of the}} test was substantially, though not significantly, greater than that on the uninvolved side at the corresponding range of motion. Together with a significant reduction in pain perception after cervical mobilization, a clear tendency toward normalization of the force curve could be observed, namely, a significant decrease in force generation and a delayed onset. The control group demonstrated no differences. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrations in force generation during neural provocation testing are present in patients with neurogenic pain and can be normalized with appropriate treatment modalities. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{group of}} 113 women and 73 men with periarthritis of the {{shoulder}} have been studied in detail. Electromyography showed 4 patients with neuralgic amyotrophy who had been referred for the shoulder study but were excluded on this basis. Nerve conduction studies showed little difference between the periarthritic group and a control group, apart from some reduction in amplitude and potential, and in women a suggestion of an increased latency. Duration of the action potential was equal. 6 patients had an undoubtedly long latency compatible with median nerve compression. Degenerative changes {{were found in the}} glenohumeral joints in 6 - 9 %. Degenerative changes were found at the acromioclavicular joints in 31 % of the men and 44 % of the women. Calcification was found around 11 {{of the shoulder}} joints. There was frequently a previous history of 'rheumatism' before the episode of periarthritis. In one-third of the women 'nonspecific rheumatism' had occurred. <b>Cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> and a previous episode of shoulder pain had occurred more often in the women. Arthrography was performed in 7 patients and there was a reduction in volume of material that could be injected in only one patient. There was obliteration of the axillary fold in that patient, and a torn capsule in a patient who had previously been manipulated. Lateral cervical spine x-rays were compared with films from an epidemiological survey. The disc space/vertebral body height ratio was taken, overcoming the magnification effects shown by technical alterations in the method of taking films. Good intra- and interobserver correlation was found for this ratio, but not for the width of the canal. There was no difference in the disc/body ratio between the periarthritic and control group in the upper cervical region. In the C 5 / 6 and C 6 / 7 intervertebral discs there was evidence of more disc degeneration in the periarthritic group. The differences from the control group were not great because of the high incidence of disc space narrowing and osteophytosis after the age of 45 years in the general population...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> (CP) is a highincidence and {{prevalent}} condition. Cervical lateral glide (CLG) is a firstline {{treatment of}} CP. There is a current lack of enough high-quality randomized controlled double-blind clinical trials that measure {{the effectiveness of}} neural tissue mobilization techniques such as the CLG and its specific effect over CP. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the effect of CLG neural mobilization in treating subjects who suffer from CP, compared with the complete absence of treatment. This investigation was a singlecenter, blinded, parallel randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). One hundred forty-seven individuals were screened in a medical center from July to November 2015. Fifty-eight participants were diagnosed with CP.. Participants were recruited and randomly assigned into two groups of 29 subjects. The intervention group received CLG treatment, and the control group (CG) was assigned to a six-week waiting list to receive treatment. Randomization was carried out by concealed computer software randomized printed cards. The primary outcome was pain intensity, reported through the Numeric Rating Scale for Pain (NRSP). Secondary outcomes were physical function involving the affected upper limb using the Quick DASH scale and ipsilateral cervical rotation (ICR) using a CROM device. Assessments were made at baseline and one hour after treatment. The CLG group NRSP mean value was significantly (P< 0. 0001) superior to those obtained by the CG. Subjects treated with CLG reported an average NRSP decrease of 2. 16 points (35 %). CROM device and Quick DASH outcome values also reported significant (P < 0. 0001) improvements only in the CLG group. Cohen’s d showed a very large effect of the CLG intervention at subject discharge. Due to the lack of dipper subgroup analysis and additional reproductions of the applied protocol, the authors considered the generalization of the study results to be impossible. CLG is superior to the absence of treatment in reducing pain and increasing the affected upper limb function of subjects who suffer from CP. CLG may be considered an effective treatment in specific cases of CP. SIN FINANCIACIÓN 2. 820 JCR (2016) Q 1, 32 / 155 Medicine, general and internalUE...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} case of two {{patients}} who developped delayed malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) following radiotherapy. Case report: the first patient is a sixty year-old woman with a 2 years history of right <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain</b> and weakness. The neurological examination depicted severe weakness, atrophy and loss of sensation in the right C 5 and C 6 territories. A subclavicular hardened and enlarged lymph node was noted. Her past medical history was notable for a Hodgkin’s disease (HD) treated with radiation therapy (> 40 Gy) 35 years earlier. Brachial plexus MRI revealed a tumoral mass arising from the right brachial plexus. Biopsy of the subclavicular mass revealed a poorly differentiated malignant tumour consisting of spindle cells showing moderate polymorphism and a high mitotic index. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for the S- 100 protein, the CD 56 and for the epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and a diagnosis of MPNST of the brachial plexus was proposed. The second case is a 36 year-old man referred for a history of right sciatic neuralgia that appeared 3 years earlier. The medical history of the patient was notable for a right seminoma, treated by orchidectomy and prophylactic radiotherapy (24 Gy) 5 years earlier. The neurologic examination revealed right L 5 and S 1 radicular territories involvement, and the CT of the pelvis demonstrated a nodular mass {{at the level of}} the greater sciatic foramen. A surgical biopsy was performed and the neuropathological findings were consistent with a diagnosis of low-grade MPSNT. Discussion: MPNSTs are rare tumors accounting for 3 to 10 % of all tissues sarcomas. Half of the cases described are sporadic, while the other half tend to appear in patients suffering from tumor prone conditions, such as neurofibromatosis type 1. Although secondary neoplasms are known complications of radiotherapy, descriptions of peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNST) are scarce. The exact pathophysiology of radiation-induced PNSTs remains unclear but vascular alterations, direct damages to axon or Schwann cell and nerve compression by soft tissue fibrosis are thought to play a role. Although surgical removal sometimes followed by chemotherapy is the mainstay of MPNSTs, they usually carry a poor prognosis. Our 2 cases emphasize that the possibility of radiation-induced MPNST has to be kept in mind when investigating a localized neuropathy in a previously irradiated area. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to verify the value of {{computed}} tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of the "crowned dens" syndrome, not only in crystal deposition diseases, but also in other rheumatic or nonrheumatic conditions. Materials and methods. Thirty-eight patients (15 men and 23 women; mean age 55 years; age range 35 – 79) with neck pain were examined and divided into two groups: (1) patients already identified as rheumatic and referred for further investigation of the atlantoaxial region; (2) patients with symptoms confined to the cervical spine, with inconclusive radiographic findings. Unenhanced CT of the cervical spine (Tomoscan SR 7000 Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands) was performed in all patients. There were 11 cases of rheumatoid arthritis (ten women and one man), two calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease (both women), one of systemic sclerosis (a woman), one of osteoarthritis (a man), one of seronegative arthritis (a man), four of neoplasm (one woman and three men) with suspected cervical involvement, one (a man) of haematological disease (lymphoma), one (a woman) of menopausal osteoporosis, ten (five men and five women) of recent or previous trauma with suspected involvement of the skull base and first cervical vertebrae and six of unknown painful cervical dysfunction (three men and three women). Results. CT demonstrated calcific deposits around the dens in 12 patients (three men and nine women), in the transverse and alar ligaments, and in the anterior atlantooccipital membrane. CT revealed horseshoe- or crown-like calcification surrounding the odontoid process. In our series, other rheumatic diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis, showed similar irregular calcifications of the atlantoaxial joint. Discussion. In calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease, the spine may be the only site of involvement, generally asymptomatic. Crystals located in the transverse ligament of the atlas give rise to the crowned dens syndrome, usually in patients affected by severe degenerative lesions of the atlantoaxial joint and peripheral chondrocalcinosis. Symptoms may be absent, or a neurological compressive syndrome may develop. Symptoms tend to worsen with age. The diagnosis is not always easy, as the symptoms are similar to those of other diseases, such as meningitis, <b>cervicobrachial</b> <b>pain,</b> occipitotemporal headache, calcific tendinitis of the longus colli muscle, spondylodiscitis and retropharyngeal abscess. Conclusion. CT is the gold standard in identifying crowned dens syndrome, as it is able to depict the shape and site of calcification and any bone erosions. Radiography of other joints (wrist, knee, pubic symphysis) may help to ascertain whether the disease is due to calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate or hydroxyapatite crystals, and is therefore recommended for routine patient management. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated for the study of neurological complications...|$|E
