40|$|A large {{theoretical}} {{literature suggests}} that …nancial frictions provide a mechanism which ampli…es and propagates macroeconomic shocks.

Motivated by these results, in this paper we re-examine the quantitative role of …nancial frictions in business cycles to address the following question: is there something wrong with the <b>credit</b> <b>multiplier?</b> Our answer is no. In coming to this answer, we work with a model with reproducible capital and collateral constraints within two setups, a general and a partial equilibrium.

In particular, in a model with reproducible capital, general equilibrium dynamics counteract the logic of price ‡uctuations described by theoretical models, thus preventing the <b>credit</b> <b>multiplier</b> from being triggered. The partial equilibrium setup allows us to con…rm our previous claim: absent the general equilibrium e¤ects, the <b>credit</b> <b>multiplier</b> is indeed an e¤ective amplifying mechanism of shocks into the economy.

Compared with saddle-path equilibria, boom-bust and sunspot equilibria are associated with both lower welfare and debt overhang, that is, a crowding-out effect of credit : when the economy is highly leveraged, it uses savings to cut down foreign debt, at the expense of both human and physical investment. Numerical examples show that volatility arises at rather low values of financial development and for debt-to-GDP ratios that fall within the range of available estimates. Finally, the effects of shocks to the world interest rate on output and consumption are amplified and persistent in the debt overhang regime. international financial markets, endogenous borrowing constraints, small open economy, debt overhang, business cycles, indeterminacy, sunspot equilibria...|$|E

30|$|There is also {{an intense}} debate {{on the role of}} <b>credit</b> <b>multiplier</b> in {{establishing}} the external financing – cash flows relationship. The <b>credit</b> <b>multiplier</b> is considered as an additional instrument, which makes the relationship between cash flows and external funds less negative. Financially constrained firms suffer more from adverse selection costs than the financially unconstrained firms do. Therefore, creditors require more loan guarantees, mainly in terms of pledging tangible assets, in order to save their contracts while lending to financially constrained firms. Thus, financially constrained firms are likely to invest excess of their internal funds in tangible assets such as plant, property, and equipment. Possession of more tangible assets makes easy for financially constrained firms to acquire external funds. Several previous studies including Campello & Hackbarth (2012), Almeida & Campello (2007), Bernanke et al. (1996), and Kiyotaki & Moore (1997) have suggested that the tangibility of assets increases the capability of financially constrained firms to seek new funds. Almeida & Campello (2007) provided evidence that firms increase their tangible assets when they are in periods of positive income shocks which in turn increase firms’ capacity for new credit and as a result more tangible assets and so on. Almeida & Campello (2010) and Gracia & Mira (2014) demonstrated that financially constrained firms are more sensitive to increase the holdings of tangible assets. Therefore, the <b>credit</b> <b>multiplier</b> effect is expected to be more prominent in case of financially constrained firms than for unconstrained firms.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of asset {{liquidity}} (“tangibility”) on firm policies {{in the presence of}} financing constraints. We do so in a real options framework that allows for the simultaneous determination of investment and financing. In the presence of financing imperfections, firms that operate more tangible assets have larger credit capacity. By expanding the firm’s capital base, the investment process engenders a feedback effect in which investment (in tangible assets) helps relax financing constraints, which in turn allows for additional investment, easing financing further, and so on. Our model formalizes the endogenous mechanism through which asset tangibility amplifies the impact of shocks to the firm’s opportunity set onto the firm’s investment and financing across time – a firm-level <b>credit</b> <b>multiplier.</b> Examining a large sample of manufacturing firms over the 1971 — 2005 period, we find support for our model’s prediction that asset tangibility boosts investment spend-ing when firms face financing constraints.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a two-country multi-frictional model where the freeze on liquidity access to commercial banks {{in one country}} raises unemployment rates via credit rationing in both countries. The expenditure-switching channel, whereby asymmetric monetary shocks traditionally lead to negative comovements of home and foreign outputs, is considerably weakened via opposite forces driving the exchange rate. Meanwhile, it is proved that financial market integration forms a transmission channel per se, without resorting to international cross-holdings of risky assets. The search and matching modeling serves two purposes. First, it accounts for {{the time needed to}} restore a normal level of confidence following financial market disruptions. Second, it allows dissociating pure liquidity contractions from non-walrasian financial shocks, arriving despite global excess savings and due to heterogeneity in the quality of the banking system. The former induce negative comovements of home and foreign outputs, in accordance with the literature, whereas the new type of financial shocks does generate financial contagion. matching theory, financial markets, <b>credit</b> rationing, financial <b>multiplier,</b> international transmission, financial crises, open economy macroeconomics...|$|R

40|$|When {{firms are}} able to pledge their assets as collateral, {{investment}} and borrowing become endogenous: pledgeable assets support more borrowings that in turn allow for further investment in pledgeable assets. We show that this <b>credit</b> <b>multiplier</b> has {{a significant effect on}} investment when firms face credit constraints. Specifically, investment—cash flow sensitivities will be increasing in the degree of tangibility of financially constrained firms ’ assets. If firms are unconstrained, however, investment—cash flow sensitivities are unaffected by asset tangibility. This theoretical prediction allows us to use a “differences in differences ” approach to identify the effect of financing frictions on corporate investment: we compare the differential (marginal) effect of asset tangibility on the sensitivity of investment to cash flow across different regimes of financial constraints. Using two layers of cross-sectional contrasts helps address the concern that inferences based on investment—cash flow sensitivities are biased when Q does a poor job in controlling for investment opportunities. We implement our testing strategy on a large sample of manufacturing firms drawn from COMPUSTAT between 1971 and 2000.

40|$|We define {{liquidity}} as {{the flexibility}} to move goods (money) from one project (investment) to another. We show that credit constraints on demand by themselves can cause an under-supply of liquidity, without the uncertainty, intermediation, asymmetric information or complicated international financial framework used in other models in the literature. In this respect liquidity is like a commodity: according to our offsetting distortions principle, a distortion in the demand for any good can often be understood as an inefficiency of supply. We show that the liquidity under-supply is a non-monotone function of the credit constraint. This result is also a particular case of a more general principle applying to any commodity with supply alternatives: second best supply inefficiency is non-monotone in the demand distortion. Defining liquidity as flexibility ensures {{that there will be}} alternatives, and thus non monotonicity. If we interpret the credit constraints as the degree of financial development in the economy, our second proposition suggests that when financial markets are very undeveloped, as in some emerging markets, financial innovation may paradoxically make government intervention (taxation) more necessary. Finally, we think about the magnitude of the under-supply {{in the context of a}} specific demand distortion. We model the credit constraint by assuming that borrowers will default unless their promises are covered by collateral. Further, we assume that only an exogenous proportion beta of a durable good can serve as collateral. This parameter will represent the degree of financial development of the economy. We show that when the price of the collateral is endogenous, the magnitude of the under supply can be much larger. Any policy intervention that affects the interest rate in equilibrium will have two effects on the borrowing constraint: a direct effect, also present in the case when the credit constraint is exogenous, and an indirect effect through the price of the collateral. We explore our findings by solving and simulating a particular case in which utilities for the consumption good and collateral are quadratic.
