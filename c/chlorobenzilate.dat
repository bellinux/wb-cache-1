50|$|There is no {{data on the}} {{carcinogenic}} {{effects of}} <b>chlorobenzilate</b> in humans. However, when mice were administered the substance orally, carcinogenic effects were observed. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has therefore classified <b>chlorobenzilate</b> as a probable human carcinogen (Group B2). The International Agency for Research on Cancer has concluded that there is insufficient information available to evaluate the carcinogenicity of <b>chlorobenzilate</b> in humans.|$|E
50|$|International {{trade in}} <b>chlorobenzilate</b> is {{regulated}} by the Rotterdam Convention.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chlorobenzilate</b> is a {{persistent}} organic pollutant and is very toxic to aquatic invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|In {{the pure}} state, <b>chlorobenzilate</b> is a colorless to pale yellow solid, but the {{commercial}} product is a brownish liquid. It {{is only slightly}} soluble in water, but miscible with acetone, toluene and methanol.|$|E
50|$|After {{carcinogenicity}} {{was established}} in mice, the use of <b>chlorobenzilate</b> was banned in the United States in 1979, except for citrus cultivation. After 1999, it was banned completely. In the European Union, its use is also currently banned.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorobenzilate</b> is a {{pesticide}} that is {{not currently}} used in the USA or Europe. It was originally developed by Ciba-Geigy and introduced in 1952. It {{was used as an}} acaricide against mites on citrus trees, including deciduous fruit trees. It has been detected as a residue on tomatoes found in Japanese markets in 2005. It is a non-systemic pesticide that works through contact and as a neurotoxin: it disrupts the functioning of the nervous system.|$|E
5000|$|Most POPs (including dieldrin) {{bioaccumulate}} in the fatty {{tissues of}} humans and other animals. The Stockholm Convention banned 12 POPs, nicknamed [...] "the dirty dozen".

This took force on 17 May 2004. Australia ratified the Convention only three days later and became a party to it in August that year.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} samples of four {{species of the}} most {{consumed}} fishes (Sefid, koli, kilca and kafal fish) were analyzed for concentrations of <b>Chlorobenzilate</b> (organochlorine pesticides). Fish were captured using electric fishing on four sites (Chalous and Babolsar city and Khazar Abad and Miankaleh regions) in Mazandaran provinces of Iran. Quantitative determination of the <b>Chlorobenzilate</b> was performed by gas chromatography electron-capture detection (GC–ECD). Samples contained detectable concentrations of <b>Chlorobenzilate</b> but at concentrations below the maximum residue limit (MRL). No different found between kinds of fishes in each sites about <b>Chlorobenzilate</b> concentrations {{but there are two}} groups of sites that were significantly different from one another in terms of <b>Chlorobenzilate</b> concentrations. According to insecticides analyzed in four kinds of fishes the Kafal in the hunting region of Khazar abad had greatest amount of 0. 038 PPM. Kilca from Babolsar had the highest amount of <b>Chlorobenzilate,</b> 0. 035 PPM (P< 0. 05). In the case of Sefid and Koli fishes in regions, significant difference was not seen. It is necessary to mention that no research has so far been done to be a criterion for comparison in this area sites. However, the concentrations of <b>Chlorobenzilate</b> residues in the muscle were found to be lower than the FAO/WHO recommended permissible and should not be public concern among peoples in Mazandaran province...|$|E
40|$|Rhodotorula {{gracilis}} metabolizes <b>Chlorobenzilate</b> (ethyl 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilate) and Chloropropylate (isopropyl 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilate) {{to several}} metabolites in a basal medium supplemented by sucrose and by several intermediates of the citric acid cycle. Three identified metabolites {{resulting from the}} degradation of either acaricide, were 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilic acid, 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone, and carbon dioxide. <b>Chlorobenzilate,</b> i. e., ethyl ester of 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilic acid, was more easily hydrolyzed than Chloropropylate, i. e., isopropyl ester of this acid, so that larger amounts {{of carbon dioxide and}} 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone were obtained from <b>Chlorobenzilate</b> degradation. Regardless of acaricides used, longer incubation caused a higher accumulation of 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone. The probable steps of the degradation pathway are: <b>Chlorobenzilate</b> (or Chloropropylate) → 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilic acid → 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone plus carbon dioxide. It appears that the decarboxylation of 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilic acid to 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone was hindered by α-ketoglutarate and enhanced by succinate...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} {{activities of}} the mitochondrial Na+, K+ - and Mg 2 + -ATPases, from different organs of Torpedo fish, have been measured. The enzyme Na+, K+ - ATPase, from electric organ and brain tissues of the Torpedo fish, showed greater activity than that, extracted from the muscle and liver tissues. The activities of Mg 2 +- ATPase, obtained from the muscle and liver tissues {{were found to be}} more active than that, obtained from the tissues of electric organ and brain. The measurements of in vitro inhibition of both enzymes by certain neurotoxic pesticides: DOT, dicofol and <b>chlorobenzilate,</b> as well as, by the specific inhibitor, ouabain, were assessed. The results showed that, DOT caused strong inhibition on the muscle and liver Mg 2 +- ATPases, Isovalues were 8 and 10 ILMrespectively. However, dicofol showed strong inhibitory effects on the electric organ or brain Na+, K+ -ATPases activities, with Iso values equal to 6 and 14 ILM respectively. <b>Chlorobenzilate</b> showed very slight inhibitory effects on the activities of both enzymes. Ouabain showed very strong inhibition of the electric organ Na+, K+ - ATPase activity with an Isovalue equal to 41 LM...|$|E
40|$|A goiaba Ã uma das frutas tropicais mais populares e de grande aceitaÃÃo no Brasil e no mundo. A fruta goiaba pode ser alvejada por diversas pragas, reduzindo consideravelmente o rendimento da produÃÃo ocasionando a escassez da fruta no mercado. Visando o aumento da produtividade e consequentemente atender a demanda da populaÃÃo sÃo empregadas elevadas quantidades de agrotÃxicos com o intuito de combater as possÃveis pragas que venham acarretar a deterioraÃÃo da fruta. Dessa maneira, o desenvolvimento de mÃtodos analÃticos para a determinaÃÃo multirresÃduos de agrotÃxicos em alimentos Ã {{fundamental}} para o monitoramento da qualidade dos produtos consumidos pela populaÃÃo, alÃm de possibilitar aos ÃrgÃos reguladores a obtenÃÃo de resultados mais rÃpidos e confiÃveis. Neste trabalho, foi adaptado e validado um mÃtodo para a determinaÃÃo de agrotÃxicos na fruta goiaba, executando-se o preparo da amostra atravÃs do mÃtodo QuEChERS modificado, substituindo-se o solvente acetonitrila apÃs a etapa de limpeza (clean up) por solvente ciclohexano / acetato de etila 1 : 1 e adiÃÃo de carvÃo ativo para maior limpeza do extrato. Os limites de detecÃÃo (LD) variaram entre 0, 002 e 0, 010 mg kg- 1 e os limites de quantificaÃÃo (LQ) variaram entre 0, 005 e 0, 030 mg kg- 1. Todas as curvas analÃticas construÃdas usando o solvente e a matriz apresentaram significÃncia estatÃstica. Quando comparadas Ãs curvas analÃticas, verificou-se forte efeito matriz para o clorobenzilato, diferentemente do hexaclorobenzeno e da ametrina onde o efeito de matriz foi pouco significativo. Nas anÃlises de amostras de goiaba comercializada na cidade de Fortaleza, foi detectado a presenÃa de agrotÃxicos em 7 amostras. Dos agrotÃxicos detectados, apenas a trifloxistrobina Ã permitida para a cultura da goiaba, entretanto a concentraÃÃo deste composto Ã inferior ao limite mÃximo de resÃduo permitido para a goiaba (LMR = 0, 050 mg kg- 1) segundo a ANVISA. Guava {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and widely accepted in Brazil and worldwide tropical fruits. The fruit can be targeted by various pests, reducing considerably the yield thus causing a slowdown or even a shortage of fruit on the market. Aiming the increase in productivity and ultimately the population's demand high amounts of pesticides are used in order to counter potential pests that may lead to a deterioration of the fruit. Thus, the development of analytical methods for multiresidue determination of pesticides in food is essential for the efficient monitoring of these compounds in the products consumed by the population, enabling regulators to obtain faster and more reliable results. In this work a method for the determination of pesticides in guava was developed and validated, running the sample preparation by modified QuEChERS method, replacing the acetonitrile solvent after cleaning step by cyclohexane / ethyl acetate solvent acetate 1 : 1 and addition of activated charcoal to extract greater cleanliness. The limits of detection (LOD) ranged between 0. 002 and 0. 010 mg kg - 1 and the limits of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 0. 005 to 0. 030 mg kg- 1. All calibration curves constructed in solvent and in matrix showed statistical significance when compared to the analytical curves and a strong matrix effect for <b>chlorobenzilate,</b> unlike hexachlorobenzene and ametrina where the matrix effect was negligible. In the analyzes of samples of guava sold in the city of Fortaleza, pesticides were found in 7 samples. Pesticides detected, trifloxystrobin is only allowed for the cultivation of guava, however the concentration of this compound is below the maximum residue limit allowed for guava (MRL = 0. 050 mg kg- 1) according to ANVIS...|$|E
