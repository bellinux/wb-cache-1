500|$|Four main {{strategies}} {{have been used}} by translators. The first leaves all characters' names unchanged and in their original spelling: thus the name is respected and readers reminded of the original <b>cultural</b> <b>setting,</b> but the liveliness of the pun is lost. Eva Malagoli varied this source-oriented approach by using both the English Christian names and the adjective earnest, thus preserving the pun and the English character of the play, but possibly straining an Italian reader. A third group of translators replaced Ernest with a name that also represents a virtue in the target language, favouring transparency for readers in translation over fidelity to the original. For instance, in Italian, these versions variously call the play L'importanza di essere Franco/Severo/Fedele, the given names being respectively the values of honesty, propriety, and loyalty. French offers a closer pun: [...] "" [...] is both a first name and the quality of steadfastness, so the play is commonly known as De l'importance d'être Constant, though Jean Anouilh translated the play under the title: Il est important d'être Aimé ("" [...] is a name which also means [...] "beloved"). These translators differ in their attitude to the original English honorific titles, some change them all, or none, but most leave a mix partially as a compensation for the added loss of Englishness. Lastly, one translation gave the name an Italianate touch by rendering it as Ernesto; this work liberally mixed proper nouns from both languages.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} claimed that {{blending}} {{processes such as}} trade and exchange have always been {{more important in the}} evolution of cultural similarities and differences among human populations than the branching process of population fissioning. In this paper, we report the results of a novel comparative study designed to shed light on this claim. We fitted the bifurcating tree model that biologists use to represent the relationships of species to 21 biological data sets that have been used to reconstruct the relationships of species and/or higher level taxa and to 21 <b>cultural</b> data <b>sets.</b> We then compared the average fit between the biological data sets and the model with the average fit between the <b>cultural</b> data <b>sets</b> and the model. Given that the biological data sets can be confidently assumed to have been structured by speciation, which is a branching process, our assumption was that, if cultural evolution is dominated by blending processes, the fit between the bifurcating tree model and the <b>cultural</b> data <b>sets</b> should be significantly worse than the fit between the bifurcating tree model and the biological data <b>sets.</b> Conversely, if <b>cultural</b> evolution is dominated by branching processes, the fit between the bifurcating tree model and the <b>cultural</b> data <b>sets</b> should be no worse than the fit between the bifurcating tree model and the biological data sets. We found that the average fit between the <b>cultural</b> data <b>sets</b> and the bifurcating tree model was not significantly different from the fit between the biological data sets and the bifurcating tree model. This indicates that the <b>cultural</b> data <b>sets</b> are not less tree-like than are the biological data sets. As such, our analysis does not support the suggestion that blending processes have always been more important than branching processes in cultural evolution. We conclude from this that, rather than deciding how cultural evolution has proceeded a priori, researchers need to ascertain which model or combination of models is relevant in a particular case and why...|$|R
2500|$|The {{affiliation}} to {{the avant-garde}} {{came with a}} sharp critique of Romanian culture, accused by Fondane of promoting imitation and parochialism. During a period which ended with his 1923 departure, the young poet sparked polemic {{with a series of}} statements in which, reviewing the impact of local Francophilia, he equated Romania with a colony of France. This theory proposed a difference between Westernization and [...] "parasitism": [...] "If a foreign intellectual direction is always useful, an alien soul is always a danger." [...] He did not cease to promote foreign culture at home, but stated a complex argument about the need to recognize differences in culture: his global conclusion about civilizations, which he viewed as equal but not identical, built on Gourmont's theory about an [...] "intellectual constancy" [...] throughout human history, as well as on philosopher Henri Bergson's critique of mechanism. In parallel, Fondane criticized the <b>cultural</b> <b>setting</b> of Greater Romania, noting that it was so Bucharest-focused that Transylvanian authors only became widely known by attending the capital's Casa Capșa restaurant. In his retrospective interpretation of Romanian literature, the avant-garde essayist stated that there were precious few authors who could be considered original, primarily citing Ion Creangă, the peasant writer, as a model of authenticity. While stating this point in his Imagini și cărți din Franța, Fondane cited in his favor a traditionalist culture critic, historian Nicolae Iorga.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "pseudoscience" [...] {{is derived}} from the Greek root pseudo meaning false and the English word science, which is itself derived from the Latin word [...] "scientia", meaning [...] "knowledge". Although the term has been in use since at least the late 18th century (e.g. used during 1796 by James Pettit Andrews in {{reference}} to alchemy) the concept of pseudoscience as distinct from real or proper science seems to have become more widespread during the mid-19th century. Among the first recorded uses of the word [...] "pseudo-science" [...] was during 1844 in the Northern Journal of Medicine, I 387: [...] "That opposite kind of innovation which pronounces what has been recognized as a branch of science, to have been a pseudo-science, composed merely of so-called facts, connected together by misapprehensions under the disguise of principles". An earlier recorded use of the term was in 1843 by the French physiologist François Magendie. During the 20th century, the word was used pejoratively to describe explanations of phenomena which were claimed to be scientific, but which were not in fact supported by reliable experimental evidence. From time to time, though, the usage of the word occurred in a more formal, technical manner around a perceived threat to individual and institutional security in a social and <b>cultural</b> <b>setting.</b>|$|E
