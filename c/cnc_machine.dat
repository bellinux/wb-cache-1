30|$|<b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> {{systems are}} inevitably confronted with {{frequent}} changes in energy behaviors {{because they are}} widely used to perform various machining tasks. It {{is a challenge to}} understand and analyze the flexible energy behaviors in <b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> systems. A method to model flexible energy behaviors in <b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> systems based on hierarchical objected-oriented Petri net (HOONet) is proposed. The structure of the HOONet is constructed of a high-level model and detail models. The former is used to model operational states for <b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> systems, and the latter is used to analyze the component models for operational states. The machining parameters having great impacts on energy behaviors in <b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> systems are declared with the data dictionary in HOONet models. A case study based on a CNC lathe is presented to demonstrate the proposed modeling method.

40|$|Abstract — Computer Numerically Controlled (<b>CNC)</b> <b>machining</b> of splitblock {{waveguide}} circuits {{has become}} the primary method of constructing terahertz waveguide circuits.

At both the University of Arizona and Arizona State University, we have developed techniques for machining splitblock waveguide circuits using purpose-built ultra high precision <b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> centers designed for micromachining. These systems combine the automation of a traditional <b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> center, including a high capacity toolchanger, workpiece and tool metrology systems and a large work volume, with the precision of custom laboratory systems.

30|$|Based on the {{characteristics}} of the flexible energy behaviors in <b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> systems mentioned above, the energy consumption of <b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> systems is divided into the energy consumed by the operational states of the machine tools (e.g., standby and processing). It can be conceived as a set of discrete events triggered by the operational state change during the <b>machining</b> process. Simultaneously, <b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> systems are inevitably confronted with frequent changes in energy behaviors because they are widely used to perform various machining tasks. To effectively model the energy consumption, the approaches need to support the concepts of object-orientation including modularization and encapsulation. Since a hierarchical object-oriented Petri Net (HOONet) is a kind of discrete event modeling method and integrates the merits of object-oriented programming and Petri nets, it offers more flexibility for adapting to variances in <b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> systems. Therefore, a HOONet is used to model the flexible energy behaviors of <b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> systems. The structure of a HOONet is constructed with a high-level model and detail models. The former is used to model the operational states of <b>CNC</b> <b>machining</b> systems, and the latter is used to analyze the component modes of the operational states. The machining parameters are declared with the data dictionary (DD) in HOONet models.|$|R

2500|$|From 1984 to 1991, Federal Ordnance of South El Monte, California sold a semi-auto {{version of}} the M14 rifle. [...] Initially named the M14 or M14A, the rifle {{utilized}} an aftermarket semi-auto receiver fitted with surplus USGI M14 parts. [...] All receivers were machined from castings of AISI 8620 alloy steel. Except for the first fifty receivers, the castings were supplied by Electro Crisol Metal, S.A. of Santander, Spain, then imported to the US for heat treatment, finish machining, and exterior phosphate treatment. M14 and M14A receivers were heat-treated using the carburizing process by a firm in Santa Ana, California, followed by finish machining on a <b>CNC</b> <b>machine</b> at Federal Ordnance in South El Monte. [...] Federal Ordnance M14 and M14A receivers were heat-treated and carburized according to USGI M14 requirements. [...] Each completed production rifle was proof fired, then tested for functioning by firing three rounds. [...] USGI parts and bolts were used extensively in Federal Ordnance rifles through at least serial number 88XX. [...] In 1989, Federal Ordnance renamed the rifle the M14SA and M14CSA. [...] Rifles in the 93XX serial range and higher have modified receivers designed to accept Chinese-made bolts, barrels, and other parts owing to a shortage of original USGI components. [...] Approximately 51,000 complete Federal Ordnance M14 rifles and 60,000 or more receivers were manufactured before production was halted in late 1991.|$|E

Even though <b>CNC</b> <b>machines</b> are major contributors to the production capacity of enterprises, the interoperability between <b>CNC</b> <b>machines</b> and both CAx systems and other <b>CNC</b> <b>machines</b> remains difficult due to the low level part programming language that is used (GM codes) to programme the machines.
