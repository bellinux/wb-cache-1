5|$|In March 1898, a {{resolution}} {{was introduced in}} <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> commission to erect a monument to Lafayette in Paris {{on behalf of the}} United States. The bill passed the Senate, and hearings were held before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Chicago businessman and philanthropist Ferdinand Peck testified in support of the bill, which though favored by the committee was not considered by the House due to higher priorities during the Spanish–American War.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{his earlier}} battle with Stevens, Blaine {{led the fight}} in <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> strong dollar. After the {{issuance}} of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the {{value of the dollar}} stood at a low ebb. A bipartisan group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F. Butler and Democrat George H. Pendleton, wished to preserve the status quo and allow the Treasury to continue to issue greenbacks and even to use them to pay the interest due on pre-war bonds. Blaine called this idea a repudiation of the nation’s promise to investors, which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and his hard money allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Vancouver Centennial Corporation {{hoped to}} sell {{commemorative}} half dollars at the planned celebration, and persuaded Representative Albert Johnson of Washington state to introduce {{legislation in the}} House of Representatives. In May 1924, he and Senator Wesley Jones, also of Washington state, introduced legislation in their houses of <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> half dollar commemorating the centennial of Fort Vancouver. The bills were not given any hearings. Indiana Representative Albert Vestal, {{the chairman of the}} House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, met with Johnson and persuaded him to introduce a bill for a medal instead. Vestal reasoned that the Treasury Department was opposing more commemorative coin issues, as these were finding their way into circulation and confusing the public. On February 3, 1925, Jones introduced a bill for a medal, and on the 12th, Johnson did the same.|$|E

At least a portion of these missiles will be installed on the navy's s.|$|R
5|$|Willkie {{enrolled}} at Indiana School of Law in late 1915. He {{was a top}} student, and graduated with high honors in 1916. At the commencement ceremony, with {{the state supreme court}} present, he gave a provocative speech criticizing his school. The faculty withheld his degree, but granted it after two days of intense debate. Willkie joined his parents' law firm, but volunteered for the United States Army on April 2, 1917, the day President Woodrow Wilson asked <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> declaration of war against Germany. An army clerk transposed his first two names; with Willkie unwilling to invest the time to have the bureaucracy correct it, he kept his name as Wendell Lewis Willkie. Commissioned as a first lieutenant, Willkie was sent for artillery training, meaning he did not embark for France until September 1918. In January of that year, he married Edith Wilk, a librarian from Rushville, Indiana; the couple had one son, Philip. The war ended before Willkie reached the front, and he spent his time defending soldiers who had slipped away for time in Paris against orders. He was recommended for promotion to captain, but was discharged in early 1919 before the paperwork went through.|$|E

50|$|When Van Voorhis {{moved to}} Zanesville he became {{involved}} in the Republican Political Committee Organization. He was admitted to the bar in 1874.In 1892, he was nominated <b>for</b> 53d <b>Congress.</b> He served in 53rd-58th <b>Congresses,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> total of 12 years.

50|$|In {{a letter}} {{circulated}} to all MPs {{on the day}} of the vote, the Conservative MP Steve Baker claimed the public appetite for the vote could be seen with the strength of support in each constituency for the People's Pledge campaign and the number of supporters that attended the <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> EU Referendum on Sat 22 October.|$|R
50|$|When {{campaigning for}} {{president}} during 1928, one of Herbert Hoover's promises to help beleaguered farmers {{had been to}} increase tariffs of agricultural products. Hoover won, and Republicans maintained comfortable majorities in the House and the Senate during 1928. Hoover then asked <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> increase of tariff rates for agricultural goods and a decrease of rates for industrial goods.|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} such admirable efforts, however, Woodbury was clearly an {{obsolete}} ship, and in barely serviceable condition due to rotting timbers and worn out boilers. In 1913, the Revenue Cutter Service succeeded in its request to <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> replacement vessel, which was slated to enter service in 1915.|$|E
25|$|Years later, {{the crew}} of the Liberty petitioned the Texas <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> share of the prize money of the Pelicano. The Judiciary Committee ruled that since the District Court of Brazoria had {{admiralty}} jurisdiction and had properly condemned the Pelicano, {{the crew of}} Liberty was entitled to a just share of the prize.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{was forced to}} give way and to make vague but significant concessions. It was announced that the ultimate aim of British rule was Indian self-government, and moves in that direction were promised. Besant was freed in September 1917, welcomed by crowds all over India, and in December she took over {{as president of the}} Indian National <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year.|$|E

25|$|After the war ended, the Democrats regained {{power in}} central and western Kentucky, which the former slaveholders and their culture dominated. Because this area was the more populous and the Democrats also passed {{legislation}} essentially disfranchising freedmen, the white Democrats controlled politics {{in the state and}} sent mostly their representatives to <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> century. In the mid-1960s, the federal Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act ended legal segregation of public facilities and protected voting rights of minorities.|$|E
25|$|On October 23, 2014, the Governor of Guerrero, Ángel Aguirre Rivero, asked <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{leave of}} absence in order to step down from office. According to Mexican law, state {{governors}} cannot resign but may ask for a {{leave of absence}}; though an uncommon decision in Mexico, Aguirre decided to leave his post, pressured by his party and public opinion. State lawmakers voted to replace Rivero with Rogelio Ortega Martínez, who will serve until October 2015.|$|E
50|$|In 1857 an Anglican lay missionary named William Duncan brought Christianity to Lax Kw'alaams. But, {{feeling that}} the {{dissipated}} fort atmosphere was bad for the souls of his Tsimshian followers, he relocated with more than 800 of his flock to Metlakatla, at Metlakatla Pass just to the south.

25|$|In 1934, Peadar O'Donnell {{and other}} left-wing {{republicans}} left the IRA and founded the Republican <b>Congress.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> brief time, they revived the ICA as a paramilitary force, {{intended to be}} an armed wing for their new movement. According to Brian Hanley's history of the IRA, the revived Citizen Army had 300 or so members {{around the country in}} 1935. However, the Congress itself split in September 1934 and led to an ICA split with it. One fraction was led by Michael Price and Nora Connelly which had left congress while the opposing fraction led by O'Donnell and Roddy Connelly were loyal to those that stayed.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Pennington {{supported}} Harrison's political ambitions, but {{changed his}} position when the governor began initiating pro-slavery policies within the Indiana Territory, {{which was established}} in 1800 from the western portion of the Northwest Territory. On December 28, 1802, Harrison asked the U.S. <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ten-year suspension of Article VI of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 that prohibited slavery in the territory. Harrison argued that the anti-slavery clause discouraged migration of slave-owning settlers into the territory, but his request was denied. In September 1803 Harrison and his pro-slavery supporters introduced measures in the territorial general assembly that allowed indentured servitude, a form a slavery, within the territory. In 1805, when President Thomas Jefferson delegated his authority to Harrison to make appointments to the territory's Legislative Council, the territorial governor appointed his pro-slavery political supporters, who continued efforts to legalize slavery within the territory.|$|E
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{came under}} heavy scrutiny amongst mainly Democrats, who charged that NAFTA {{resulted in a}} loss of American jobs. NAFTA also contained no provisions for labor rights; according to the Bush administration, the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable Mexico's government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws. Bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the NAFTA trade talks. Such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vote, thereby avoiding {{a situation in which the}} president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that Congress wished to change. While initial signing was possible during his term, negotiations made slow, but steady, progress. President Clinton would go on to make the passage of NAFTA a priority for his administration, despite its conservative and Republican roots—with the addition of two side agreements—to achieve its passage in 1993. NAFTA remains controversial for its impact on wages, jobs, and overall economic growth.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of Congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on {{factors such as}} congressional leadership, presidential political influence, historical circumstances such as war, and individual initiative by members of Congress. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson made the presidency less powerful than <b>Congress</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> considerable period afterwards. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush. However, in recent years, Congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the War Powers Resolution. Nevertheless, the Presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century. Executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of Congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret; in return, knowing they {{may be in the}} dark about executive branch activity, congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies. Many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies, and this is a task that Congress is ill-suited for. Congress is slow, open, divided, and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or {{do a good job of}} overseeing such activity, according to one analysis.|$|E
