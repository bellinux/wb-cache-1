They have five {{hydroxyl}} groups (−OH) and a <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group</b> (C=O) and are cyclic when dissolved in water.

25|$|The cyano {{group in}} HCN {{can add to}} the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group</b> to form cyanohydrins, R−CH(OH)CN. In this {{reaction}} the CN− ion is the nucleophile that attacks the partially positive carbon atom of the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group.</b> The mechanism involves a pair of electrons from the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group</b> double bond transferring to the oxygen atom, leaving it single bonded to carbon and giving the oxygen atom a negative charge. This intermediate ion rapidly reacts with H+, such as from the HCN molecule, to form the alcohol group of the cyanohydrin.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} step of the {{reaction}} mechanism, the peroxyacid protonates the oxygen of the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group.</b> This makes the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group</b> more susceptible to attack by the peroxyacid. Next, the peroxyacid attacks the carbon of the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group</b> forming {{what is known as the}} Criegee intermediate. Through a concerted mechanism, one of the substituents on the ketone migrates to the oxygen of the peroxide group while a carboxylic acid leaves. This migration step is thought to be the rate determining step. Finally, deprotonation of the oxocarbenium ion produces the ester.|$|E
30|$|The albumin <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups</b> {{were only}} 30 – 36  % of the serum total <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups</b> under all conditions, {{suggesting}} that the other serum proteins are equally or even more carbonylated than albumin. However, in absolute terms, the albumin <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups</b> were significantly different in control, mono- and poly-arthritic rats. Thus, as ascorbic acid the serum albumin <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups</b> may also be regarded as possible indicators {{of the severity of}} arthritis. Moreover, the changes in the serum levels of ascorbic acid and albumin <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups</b> appeared in monoarthritis before the other systemic modifications that were evaluated here, such as the inflammatory response in the contralateral paw and the serum protein profile.|$|R

25|$|While the {{addition}} to the electron-rich alkenes and alkynes is mainly electrophilic, the nucleophilic addition {{plays an important role}} for the carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds, and especially its most important representative, the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group.</b> This process is often associated with an elimination, so that after the reaction the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group</b> is present again. It is therefore called addition-elimination reaction and may occur in carboxylic acid derivatives such as chlorides, esters or anhydrides. This reaction is often catalyzed by acids or bases, where the acids increase by the electrophilicity of the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group</b> by binding to the oxygen atom, whereas the bases enhance the nucleophilicity of the attacking nucleophile.|$|E
25|$|Monosaccharides are {{classified}} according to three different characteristics: {{the placement of}} its <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group,</b> the number of carbon atoms it contains, and its chiral handedness. If the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group</b> is an aldehyde, the monosaccharide is an aldose; if the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group</b> is a ketone, the monosaccharide is a ketose. Monosaccharides with three carbon atoms are called trioses, those with four are called tetroses, five are called pentoses, six are hexoses, and so on. These two systems of classification are often combined. For example, glucose is an aldohexose (a six-carbon aldehyde), ribose is an aldopentose (a five-carbon aldehyde), and fructose is a ketohexose (a six-carbon ketone).|$|E

In comparison with other derivatization methods reported in the literature, this method is simple, specific and can be used to detect <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups</b> in triterpenoids which have low polarity and are poorly or non-ionizable.

Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) can also add to the <b>carbonyl</b> <b>group.</b> After the elimination of water, this will result in an oxime. An ammonia derivative of the form H2NNR2 such as hydrazine (H2NNH2) or 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine can also be the nucleophile and after the elimination of water, resulting in the formation of a hydrazone, which are usually orange crystalline solids.

40|$|A novel {{method that}} permits the {{quantitative}} detection and classification of various <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups</b> in lignins has been developed. The proposed method was optimized with the quantitative trifluoromethylation {{of a series}} of carbonyl-containing lignin-like model compounds.

The various <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups</b> present in lignins were also investigated by trifluoromethylating them in the presence of catalytic amounts of tetramethylammonium fluoride (TMAF), followed by hydrolysis with TMAF in tetrahydrofuran. By using a variety of selective reactions, it became possible to assign a number of prominent 19 F NMR signals to a variety of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups</b> present in lignins.

40|$|Measurements of {{submicron}} particles by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in 14 campaigns in North America, Asia, South America, and Europe {{were used to}} identify characteristic organic functional group compositions of fuel combustion, terrestrial vegetation, and ocean bubble bursting sources, each of which often {{accounts for more than}} a third of organic mass (OM), and some of which is secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from gas-phase precursors. The majority of the OM consists of alkane, carboxylic acid, hydroxyl, and <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups.</b> The organic functional groups formed from combustion and vegetation emissions are similar to the secondary products identified in chamber studies. The near absence of <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups</b> in the observed SOA associated with combustion is consistent with alkane rather than aromatic precursors, and the absence of organonitrate groups can be explained by their hydrolysis in humid ambient conditions. The remote forest observations have ratios of carboxylic acid, organic hydroxyl, and nonacid <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups</b> similar to those observed for isoprene and monoterpene chamber studies, but in biogenic aerosols transported downwind of urban areas the formation of esters replaces the acid and hydroxyl groups and leaves only nonacid <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups.</b> The <b>carbonyl</b> <b>groups</b> in SOA associated with vegetation emissions provides striking evidence for the mechanism of esterification as the pathway for possible oligomerization reactions in the atmosphere.
