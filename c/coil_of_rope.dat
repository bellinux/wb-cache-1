500|$|Bundy {{was arrested}} on August 16, 1975 in Granger, another Salt Lake City suburb, by a Utah Highway Patrol officer who {{observed}} him cruising a residential area in the pre-dawn hours, then fleeing at high speed after seeing the patrol car. The officer noticed that the Volkswagen's front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats, and searched the car. He found a ski mask, a second mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> an ice pick, and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools. Bundy explained that the ski mask was for skiing, {{he had found the}} handcuffs in a dumpster, and the rest were common household items. However, Detective Jerry Thompson remembered a similar suspect and car description from the November 1974 DaRonch kidnapping, and Bundy's name from Kloepfer's December 1974 phone call. In a search of Bundy's apartment, police found a guide to Colorado ski resorts with a checkmark by the Wildwood Inn, and a brochure advertising the Viewmont High School play in Bountiful (where Debra Kent had disappeared), but nothing sufficiently incriminating to hold him. He was released on his own recognizance. (Bundy later said that searchers missed a collection of Polaroid photographs of his victims, which he destroyed after he was released.) ...|$|E
6000|$|The whispered communication, above {{referred}} to, had {{the effect}} of causing Bluenose to spring up from the <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> and exclaim--"You don't say so!" ...|$|E
60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} Ned took a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> and sauntered {{off to the}} spot he had indicated, where he was {{presently}} joined by the ten men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal--I--shore--rustled--all the line--aboot heah," [...] he drawled, pantingly, as {{he threw}} lassoes and <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> at Neale's feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's impossible! An army of old women, with <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>ropes</b> {{made out}} <b>of</b> time-honoured prejudices, could not draw you back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Meb-la-che-bah!" [...] {{shouted the}} biggest Arab, {{and at once}} two others wound <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> around the Woggle-Bug and tied the ends in hard knots.|$|R
6000|$|... "Something in the water," [...] cried Jack Shales, hastily {{catching}} up a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> and throwing it overboard with that promptitude which is peculiar to seamen.|$|E
60|$|The two boon companions sat {{listening}} in silence. Then Copley Banks {{glanced at the}} steward, and the man took a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> from the shot-rack behind him.|$|E
60|$|Miss Stivergill, to whom {{nothing seemed}} difficult, {{and who had}} by that time stopped her share in the noise, went into a {{cupboard}} and fetched thence a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jim laughed. It {{really was}} funny {{to see the}} old man wound round and round with <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> from his knees up to his chin.|$|R
60|$|Then it {{returned}} to the <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>ropes,</b> and, sitting down, began to chew one of them, keeping a serious eye, however, on the branch above.|$|R
60|$|He groped in the bunks: {{they were}} all empty. Then he moved towards the forepeak, which was {{hampered}} with <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> and spare chandlery in general.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look out! catch hold!" [...] cried a gruff voice, as {{a sailor}} sent a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> {{whirling}} over the raft. Jarwin caught it, {{took a turn}} round the mast, and held on.|$|E
60|$|I {{hurry to}} {{the bow of}} the boat, and find not George, but the irrepressible Wise, sitting on a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> a little dirtier and rather more {{dilapidated}} than I can remember having seen him.|$|E
60|$|He {{ran to the}} side, {{lifted a}} <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> off its belaying-pin, threw it on the deck, cut the rope clear, and hauled it to the raft, to one end of which he made it fast.|$|E
60|$|A single effort {{showed that}} they were {{powerless}} here. The door was strong, it was fastened outside, and it was heavily weighted with <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> and other substances.|$|R
60|$|All {{the young}} {{boys and the}} toughs and {{the men in the}} band got down on the lower deck forward, where the boat was dirtiest and where the anchor was and the <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|R
60|$|Now, however, {{people were}} grouped upon the stone quay, with its litter <b>of</b> fish-baskets and <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> waiting expectantly, for to-day the largest ship ever built in Tetby, by Tetby hands, {{was to start}} upon her first voyage.|$|R
60|$|He made {{fast the}} pail {{to the long}} <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> put it over the wheel, and allowed it to descend by letting the rope slip through his hands. Before it had gone far, however, he checked it.|$|E
60|$|Sam had {{sufficient}} sense {{to know that}} all his pleadings for mercy would be in vain, and he held his peace until Phil returned with a long <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> which had {{been used as a}} boat's painter.|$|E
60|$|Charlie ran in again, {{seized a}} <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> bound {{his hands and}} feet securely, and dragged him into the hut. Then he dashed some cold water on his face. The man opened his eyes, and tried to move.|$|E
60|$|In {{a quarter}} of an hour they arrived at their destination, and entered the shop, which smelt {{strongly}} <b>of</b> tar; <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> <b>of</b> all sizes were piled up one upon another by the walls, while on shelves above them were blocks, lanterns, compasses, and a great variety of gear of whose use the boys were ignorant. The chandler was standing at his door.|$|R
60|$|The men, {{who came}} along {{gradually}} and with difficulty, began {{to remove the}} barrels, <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> and spare sails stowed there. Several of them were overpowered by the smoke, {{and had to be}} carried up again; and others came down and took their places.|$|R
5000|$|... lead solo, {{in which}} the climber uses a {{self-locking}} device {{which is used to}} arrest a fall. One end <b>of</b> the <b>rope</b> may be anchored below the climber with the <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> in a bag on the climber's back, or for single-pitch climbs the device may be secured at ground level, and the climber tied into the end <b>of</b> the <b>rope.</b>|$|R
60|$|Kneeling down, {{he enjoyed}} a long, {{refreshing}} drink {{of the clear}} water, but as he started to regain his feet a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> was suddenly thrown about him, pinning his arms to his sides and rendering him absolutely helpless.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been here away," [...] said the mate, who stood up in the bow with a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> at his feet, and a boat-hook in his hand. [...] "Hold on, lads, did any one hear a cry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{one at a}} time, and me first." [...] Carson {{took the}} part <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> from Smoke's hand. [...] "You'll have to cast off. I'll take the rope and the pick. Gimme your hand so I can slip down easy." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{took his}} heavy Winchester, {{and threw a}} <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> thin <b>rope</b> over his shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt she}} was {{thoroughly}} fitted out before she sailed. She certainly looks like it," [...] Wilkinson replied as {{he glanced at}} the <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>ropes.</b> [...] "We shall get up anchor at daybreak. I want to be under sail before the Tigre. It would not look smart for a line-of-battle ship to be under weigh before a brig." ...|$|R
60|$|This was true. The marine stores, <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> kegs, charts, telescopes, log-lines, sextants, foreign shells, model ships, Chinese idols--all were gone, {{excepting}} a table, a chair, a child's crib in a corner, and the hammock, which latter {{looked more}} like an overwhelmingly heavy cloud than ever, as it hung over the clean but desolate scene.|$|R
60|$|An old {{fisherman}} stood, with a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> in his hand, {{close to}} the water's edge. Several of the others stood close to him, and four of them had hold of {{the other end of}} the rope. When the boat was within fifty yards of shore, the sail was lowered; but she still drove straight on before the wind, with scarce an abatement in her speed. A man stood in her bow, also with a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> in his hand, and, as he approached, threw it far ahead. The fisherman rushed waist deep into the water and caught the end of it, which in a moment was knotted to the one in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|But Jim was too nimble for him. He ran to {{the stern}} of the vessel, leaped on the bulwarks, flung the end of the <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> among the men, and shouting, [...] "Hold on taut, boys!" [...] sprang into the sea.|$|E
60|$|The mate, with a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> in his hand, {{rushed to}} the side, but his benevolent efforts were {{frustrated}} by the engineer, who, seeing the boatâ€™s head making straight for him, saved his life by an opportune dive. The steamer rushed by.|$|E
60|$|Dick now {{set down}} the lantern, {{went to the door}} and {{returned}} with a <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> stout <b>rope.</b>|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{two women}} "drawing water in Maya village. " The woman on the left stands {{on the edge of}} the well {{adjusting}} the pully system suspended over the well by a wood cross beam. On the ground next to her is a bucket. The woman on the right holds a <b>rope.</b> Four <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> sit {{on the edge of the}} well...|$|R
6000|$|When {{they had}} sailed {{through a small}} stream into the lake adjoining, the out-look, who was {{swinging}} in a hammock hung between {{the tops of the}} two masts, sang out, [...] "Prince ahead!" [...] Instantly all was activity on board the vessel. Story books were tucked under <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> <b>rope,</b> hem-stitching and embroidery were laid aside, and every woman was at her post.|$|R
