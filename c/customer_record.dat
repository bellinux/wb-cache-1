5000|$|The [...] "ideal" [...] {{implementation}} of SSOT {{as described above}} is rarely possible in most enterprises. This is because many organisations have multiple information systems, each of which needs access to data relating to the same entities (e.g., customer). Often these systems are purchased [...] "off-the-shelf" [...] from vendors and cannot be modified in non-trivial ways. Each of these various systems therefore needs to store {{its own version of}} common data or entities, and therefore each system must retain its own copy of a record (hence immediately violating the SSOT approach defined above). For example, an ERP (enterprise resource planning) system (such as SAP or Oracle e-Business Suite) may store a customer record; the CRM (customer relationship management) system also needs a copy of the <b>customer</b> <b>record</b> (or part of it) and the warehouse despatch system might also need a copy of {{some or all of the}} customer data (e.g., shipping address). In cases where vendors do not support such modifications, it is not always possible to replace these records with pointers to the SSOT.|$|E

Although the second attribute can be realized by reporting the billing <b>customer</b> <b>record</b> in real time, this tends to congest the signaling channel, which is not desirable. In this paper, we propose several schemes for the provision of a quick billing status report which maintains low-signaling traffic. The performance of these schemes is derived analytically.

The article proposes a method that uses various data attributes of passenger records to infer the same customer in a different week (i. e., attempts to track the same customer from week to week). The general idea behind the measure is that if two records are considered similar, ideally every trip in one <b>customer</b> <b>record</b> should have a close counterpart in the other record. The research develops a similarity function designed to maximize the percentage of positive ticket identification over a number of weeks. Once similarity has been established, customer travel patterns can be useful in helping the operator identify new routes, new timetables, and strategic decisions in relation to satisfying public transport customer demands...|$|E
