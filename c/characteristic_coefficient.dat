40|$|Additive {{manufactured}} {{lattice structures}} show a high potential for lightweight design. Currently, these structures have a periodical build-up, {{which leads to}} disadvantageous stress states. On the one hand, unfavorable bending loads on the single struts appear. This can be avoided by an adaption of {{the course of the}} structure to the main stress directions inside the part. On the other hand, different stress values are appearing inside the single struts. Therefore, a procedure for the optimization of the struts diameters is presented. Thus, it becomes possible to achieve equal stresses in the whole structure and gain a better lightweight performance. The initial structure with uniform strut diameters has a mass of 104 g, and the force at which the limit of elasticity is reached for this structure is 518. 5 N. From these values, a <b>characteristic</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 8, 891 N/g can be calculated for the ratio of load capacity to mass. To realize the optimization of the strut diameters, two tools have been created for the software Siemens NX 7. 5 32 bit by using the NX Open. NET API. With the help of these tools, it was possible to generate three differen optimized structures. The first structure has been build up with CBEAM elements, which have fixed connections among each other in the respective nodes and it was optimized with a maximum von-Mises stress as optimization goal. The resulting structure is very inhomogeneous, has a mass of 106 g, a maximum stress of 31. 38 N/mm² and a <b>characteristic</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 4. 96 N/g. Furthermore, {{it can be seen that}} the distribution of the stress over the structure is very inhomogeneous. The second structure was build up with released rotational degrees of freedom at the nodes and constraint and it was optimized with a maximum von-Mises stress as optimization goal. The result has a mass of 58. 1 g, a maximum von-Mises stress of 31. 94 N/mm², a <b>characteristic</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 8. 891 N/g and the distribution of the stress over the structure is way more homogeneous than for the optimization presented before. However, the manual effort is quite big for this method. The third structure has been build up with fixed connections among each other in the respective nodes and it was optimized with an average von-Mises stress as optimization goal. With the help of this structure was it possible to run an automated optimization which led to a good result. The resulting structure has a mass of 57. 5 g, a maximum von-Mises stress of 31, 95 N/mm², a <b>characteristic</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 8, 891 N/g and the distribution of the stress over the structure is also almost homogeneous.

40|$|A pulsed arc heater was {{designed}} and manufactured at Centrospazio to equip a new hypersonic high-enthalpy blow-down wind tunnel capable of producing flows with a specific total enthalpy up to 2. 5 MJ/kg. The heater mainly consists of two coaxial electrodes, separated by a constrictor, and a plenum chamber. The flow is heated by an electric arc ignited between the electrodes and sustained by the discharge of a large capacitor bank. The plenum chamber allows the flow to reach thermo-chemical equilibrium before the expansion in the wind tunnel nozzle. A numerical model was developed to simulate the unsteady behavior of the arc heater. The model was used during the design phase to optimize the geometrical and temporal parameters of the heater and the flow residence time. Experimental results from preliminary characterization compare favorably with numerical predictions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Harvesting {{thermoelectric}} energy mainly {{relies on}} the Seebeck effect that utilizes a temperature difference between two ends of the device for driving the diffusion of charge carriers. However, {{in an environment that}} the temperature is spatially uniform without a gradient, the pyroelectric effect has to be the choice, which is based on the spontaneous polarization in certain anisotropic solids due to a time-dependent temperature variation. Using this effect, we experimentally demonstrate the first application of pyroelectric ZnO nanowire arrays for converting heat energy into electricity.

40|$|One of the {{principal}} differences between locomotion in granular soils using legs when compared with wheels is that the drag between the leg assembly and the regolith material provides additional thrust. Experimental work is presented which demonstrates that this additional force is substantial, and can significantly augment legged vehicle Drawbar Pull. The paper also demonstrates that the drag force depends in a highly non-linear manner on sinkage depth, and linearly on leg cross section yet is only weakly dependent on leg cross-sectional shape, leg material frictional properties, or leg velocity. Comparison with modelled forces using established wedge theory techniques demonstrates poor correlation between predicted and actual results; in contrast, a modelling approach based on {{an analysis of the}} dynamics of granular materials produces an excellent correlation with experimental results and enables the drag force to be accurately characterised by deriving a constant coefficient which is characteristic of the soil material. Future work will investigate the relationship between this <b>characteristic</b> <b>coefficient</b> and the physical properties of the soil material to develop a robust method of predicting the coefficient for any soil. © 2013 ISTVS.

40|$|We {{consider}} the Clairaut {{theory of the}} equilibrium ellipsoidal figures for differentiated non-homogeneous bodies in non-synchronous rotation adding to it a tidal deformation due {{to the presence of}} an external gravitational force. We assume that the body is a fluid formed by n homogeneous layers of ellipsoidal shape and we calculate the external polar flattenings and the mean radius of each layer, or, equivalently, their semiaxes. To first order in the flattenings, the general solution can be written as ϵ_k= H_k*ϵ_h and μ_k= H_k*μ_h, where H_k is a <b>characteristic</b> <b>coefficient</b> for each layer which only depends on the internal structure of the body and ϵ_h, μ_h are the flattenings of the equivalent homogeneous problem. For the continuous case, we study the Clairaut differential equation for the flattening profile, using the Radau transformation to find the boundary conditions when the tidal potential is added. Finally, the theory is applied to several examples: i) a body composed of two homogeneous layers; ii) bodies with simple polynomial density distribution laws and iii) bodies following a polytropic pressure-density law.

40|$|International audienceLaser {{drilling}} in the percussion regime is commonly used in the aircraft industry to drill sub-millimetre holes in metallic targets. Characteristic laser intensities {{in the range of}} 10 MW cm− 2 are typically employed for drilling metallic targets. With these intensities the temperature of the irradiated matter is above the vaporization temperature and the drilling process is led by hydrodynamic effects. Although the main physical processes involved are identified, this process is not correctly understood or completely controlled. A major <b>characteristic</b> <b>coefficient</b> of laser-matter interaction for this regime, which is the absorptivity of the laser on the irradiated surface, is still unknown, because of the perturbing effects due to laser beam geometrical trapping inside the drilled hole.

The high water content slurries are converted to materials with superior dewatering properties by adding long-chain synthetic polymers. Given the solid and liquid composition of a slurry, a high settling rate alongside a high solids content can be achieved by optimizing the various polymers parameters: ionic type (T), charge density (C), molecular weight (M), and dosage (D). This paper developed a statistical model to predict field performance of a selected metal mine slurry using laboratory test data. Results of sedimentationconsolidation tests were fitted using the method of least squares. A newly devised polymer <b>characteristic</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Cp) that combined the various polymer parameters correlated well with the observed dewatering behavior as the R 2 equalled 0. 95 for void ratio and 0. 84 for hydraulic conductivity.

Further, the void ratio-effective stress and the hydraulic conductivity-void ratio relationships were found to be e = a σ ′ b and k = 10 (c + e d), respectively. ...|$|E

It is shown that due to the isoperibolic boundary condition, the thermal behaviour at the established periodic state can be managed according to different orders, i. e. either a continuous or fluctuating contribution. A complete analytical solution is proposed for the complex problem model, then a simplified model is proposed. Finally, a simple homogeneous equivalent thin body model approximation with a <b>characteristic</b> <b>coefficient</b> function of a biphasic flow mixing law is sufficient for describing the thermal behaviour of the media under isoperibolic conditions.
