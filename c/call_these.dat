5|$|Red wattlebirds are noisy animals, {{producing}} {{a range of}} raucous calls. Pairs of birds appear to duet, particularly at food sources, with the male {{producing a}} loud cackle and the female a whistling call. The male's cackle is loudest between 1and 3kHz frequency. A guttural-sounding call, it has been variously described as having a squawking, coughing or hiccuping sound. Males cackle when foraging by themselves, when with other birds, or when declaring their territory to other birds. The whistling call consists of up to five rapid whistles {{that may or may}} not ascend in tone and are repeated 3–4 times. Both sexes commonly utter a single chock note that may be harsh and guttural or have 4–5 harmonics. This is thought to be a contact <b>call.</b> <b>These</b> calls all carry over long distances.|$|E

25|$|Like other Christian churches, Pentecostals {{believe that}} certain rituals or ceremonies were instituted as a pattern and command by Jesus in the New Testament. Pentecostals {{commonly}} <b>call</b> <b>these</b> ceremonies ordinances. Many Christians <b>call</b> <b>these</b> sacraments, but this term is not generally used by Pentecostals and certain other Protestants {{as they do}} not see ordinances as imparting grace. Instead the term sacerdotal ordinance is used to denote the distinctive belief that grace is received directly from God by the congregant with the officiant serving only to facilitate rather than acting as a conduit or vicar.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} of the amphikinetic root nouns is disputed. Since these words have no suffix, they {{differ from the}} amphikinetic polysyllables in the strong cases (no o-grade) and in the locative singular (no e-grade suffix). Some scholars prefer to <b>call</b> <b>these</b> nouns amphikinetic and the corresponding polysyllables holokinetic (or holodynamic, from holos = whole).|$|E
25|$|The problem arises with non-European {{languages}}. Many constructions {{in these}} languages share {{at least one}} property with the canonical European passive, but not all. While it seems justified to <b>call</b> <b>these</b> constructions passive when comparing them to European languages' passive constructions, as a whole the passives of the world's languages do not share a single common feature.|$|E

25|$|In 1809, Louis Poinsot rediscovered Kepler's figures, by {{assembling}} star pentagons {{around each}} vertex. He also assembled convex polygons around star vertices to discover two more regular stars, the great icosahedron and great dodecahedron. Some people <b>call</b> <b>these</b> two the Poinsot polyhedra. Poinsot {{did not know}} if he had discovered all the regular star polyhedra.|$|E
25|$|Other {{senses of}} graph stem from {{different}} {{conceptions of the}} edge set. In one more general conception, E is a set together with a relation of incidence that associates with each edge two vertices. In another generalized notion, E is a multiset of unordered pairs of (not necessarily distinct) vertices. Many authors <b>call</b> <b>these</b> types of object multigraphs or pseudographs.|$|E
25|$|There {{are seven}} {{families}} of isogonal each family having a real-valued parameter determining the overlap between sides of adjacent tiles or the ratio between the edge lengths of different tiles. Two {{of the families}} are generated from shifted square, either progressive or zig-zagging positions. Grünbaum and Shephard <b>call</b> <b>these</b> tilings uniform although it contradicts Coxeter's definition for uniformity which requires edge-to-edge regular polygons. Such isogonal tilings are actually topologically identical to the uniform tilings, with different geometric proportions.|$|E

25|$|Given such a pairing, {{some natural}} numbers are paired with subsets that contain {{the very same}} number. For instance, in our example the number 2 is paired with the subset {1, 2, 3}, which {{contains}} 2 as a member. Let us call such numbers selfish. Other natural numbers are paired with subsets that do not contain them. For instance, in our example the number 1 is paired with the subset {4, 5}, which does not contain the number 1. <b>Call</b> <b>these</b> numbers non-selfish. Likewise, 3 and 4 are non-selfish.|$|E
25|$|With these massacres came formal {{orders for}} forced evacuation; also, a 'scorched earth' policy was initiated: farms were destroyed, crops and forests burned and villages razed. There were many {{reported}} atrocities and {{a campaign of}} mass killing universally targeted at residents of the Vendée regardless of combatant status, political affiliation, age or gender. By July 1796, the estimated Vendean dead numbered between 117,000 and 500,000, out of a population of around 800,000. Some historians <b>call</b> <b>these</b> mass killings the first modern genocide, specifically because intent to exterminate the Catholic Vendeans was clearly stated, though others have rejected these claims.|$|E
25|$|Legal writing values precedent, as {{distinct}} from authority. Precedent means the way things have been done before. For example, a lawyer who must prepare a contract and who has prepared a similar contract before will often re-use, with limited changes, the old contract for the new occasion. Or a lawyer who has filed a successful motion to dismiss a lawsuit may use the same or a very similar form of motion again in another case, and so on. Many lawyers use and re-use written documents in this way and <b>call</b> <b>these</b> re-usable documents templates or, less commonly, forms.|$|E

25|$|We can {{now give}} a {{complete}} description of w = z½. To do {{so we need}} two copies of the z-plane, each of them cut along the real axis. On one copy we define the square root of 1 to be e0 = 1, {{and on the other}} we define the square root of 1 to be e'iπ = 1. We <b>call</b> <b>these</b> two copies of the complete cut plane sheets. By making a continuity argument we see that the (now single-valued) function w = z½ maps the first sheet into the upper half of the w-plane, where 0 ≤ arg(w) < π, while mapping the second sheet into {{the lower half of the}} w-plane (where π ≤ arg(w) < 2π).|$|E

500|$|The Japanese started {{designing}} the B64 class, which {{was similar to}} the Alaska but with [...] guns. News of the Alaskas led them to upgrade the design, creating Design B-65. Armed with 356mm guns, the B65s would have been the best armed of the new breed of battlecruisers, but they still would have had only sufficient protection to keep out eight-inch shells. Much like the Dutch, the Japanese got as far as completing the design for the B65s, but never laid them down. By the time the designs were ready the Japanese Navy recognized that they had little use for the vessels and that their priority for construction should lie with aircraft carriers. Like the Alaskas, the Japanese did not <b>call</b> <b>these</b> ships battlecruisers, referring to them instead as super-heavy cruisers.|$|E
500|$|The {{simplest}} possible cellular automata have a one-dimensional {{array of}} cells, {{each of which}} can hold a binary value (either 0 or 1), with each cell having a neighborhood consisting only of it and its two nearest cells on either side; these are called the elementary cellular automata. [...] If the update rule for such an automaton causes each cell to always remain in the same state, then the automaton is reversible: the previous state of all cells can be recovered from their current states, because for each cell the previous and current states are the same. Similarly, if the update rule causes every cell to change its state from 0 to 1 and vice versa, or if it causes a cell to copy the state from a fixed neighboring cell, or if it causes it to copy a state and then reverse its value, it is necessarily reversible. [...] <b>call</b> <b>these</b> types of reversible cellular automata, {{in which the state}} of each cell depends only on the previous state of one neighboring cell, [...] "trivial". Despite its simplicity, the update rule that causes each cell to copy the state of a neighboring cell is important in the theory of symbolic dynamics, where it is known as the shift map.|$|E
