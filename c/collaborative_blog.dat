40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that edu-blogs, or blogs used for {{educational}} purposes, are gaining popularity in K- 12 education. Many teachers are beginning to use blogs as an instructional tool. Some teachers are implementing class blogs to enrich student knowledge, while others are using their own blogs to communicate with students, parents and other teachers.

Less was written about teachers writing their own blogs and the possible benefits for teaching and learning.
