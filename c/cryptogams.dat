5|$|In 1828 Alexandre Brongniart's son, the {{botanist}} Adolphe Brongniart, {{published the}} introduction to a longer work {{on the history of}} fossil plants. Adolphe Brongniart concluded that the history of plants could roughly be divided into four parts. The first period was characterized by <b>cryptogams.</b> The second period was characterized by the appearance of the conifers. The third period brought emergence of the cycads, and the fourth by the development of the flowering plants (such as the dicotyledons). The transitions between each of these periods was marked by sharp discontinuities in the fossil record, with more gradual changes within the periods. Brongniart's work is the foundation of paleobotany and reinforced the theory that life on earth had a long and complex history, and different groups of plants and animals made their appearances in successive order. It also supported the idea that the Earth's climate had changed over time as Brongniart concluded that plant fossils showed that during the Carboniferous the climate of Northern Europe must have been tropical.|$|E

50|$|The {{vegetation}} of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island is {{a mixture}} of rush/grass, forb, <b>cryptogam</b> tundra, <b>cryptogam</b> herb barren, and sedge/grass,moss wetland. The rush/grass, forb, <b>cryptogam</b> tundra covers the bulk of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island. It consists mostly of very low-growing grasses, rushes, forbs, mosses, lichens, and liverworts. These plants typically cover about 40-80 percent of the surface of the ground. The soils are typically moist, fine-grained, and often hummocky. The <b>cryptogam</b> herb barren consists of dry to wet barren landscapes with scattered, herbs, lichens, mosses, and liverworts. Sedges, dwarf shrubs, and peaty mires are normally absent. These plants form a sparse (2-40%) and low-growing plant cover that often occurs as dark streaks on the otherwise barren lands, composed largely of bryophytes and cryptogamic crusts. Sedge/grass,moss wetlands, which occur on the northwest and southeast ends of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island, consist of wetland complexes dominated by sedges, grasses, and mosses. These wetlands occupy low, perennially wet parts of the landscape.|$|R

We used inventory data from four distinct vegetation types, near Hobart Tasmania, to address the proposition that vegetation type, vascular plant taxon composition, and environmental variables can act as surrogates for mosses and macrofungi in reservation planning. The four vegetation types proved distinct in their taxon composition for all macrofungi, mosses, and vascular plants. We tested {{the strength of the}} relationships between the composition of <b>cryptogam</b> taxonomic groups and vascular plant composition and between the environmental variables and canopy cover. Taxon composition of woody vascular plants and vascular plants was the best predictor of the taxon composition of mosses and macrofungi.

500|$|The strictest {{definition}} of [...] "plant" [...] includes only the [...] "land plants" [...] or embryophytes, which include seed plants (gymnosperms, including the pines, and flowering plants) and the free-sporing <b>cryptogams</b> including ferns, clubmosses, liverworts, hornworts and mosses. Embryophytes are multicellular eukaryotes descended from an ancestor that obtained its energy from sunlight by photosynthesis. They have life cycles with alternating haploid and diploid phases. The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, {{known as the}} gametophyte, nurtures the developing diploid embryo sporophyte within its tissues for {{at least part of}} its life, even in the seed plants, where the gametophyte itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte. Other groups of organisms that were previously studied by botanists include bacteria (now studied in bacteriology), fungi (mycology) – including lichen-forming fungi (lichenology), non-chlorophyte algae (phycology), and viruses (virology). However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi (including lichens) and photosynthetic protists are usually covered in introductory botany courses.|$|E

6000|$|The lowest {{forms of}} {{vegetable}} life--the cellular plants--have {{been found in}} Lower Silurian deposits {{in the form of}} three species of marine algae; and in the whole Silurian formation fifty species have been recognised.

We have indications, however, of a still more ancient vegetation, in the carbonaceous shales and thick beds of graphite far down in the Middle Laurentian, since there is no other known agency than the vegetable cell by means of which carbon can be extracted from the atmosphere and fixed in the solid state. These great beds of graphite, therefore, imply the existence of abundance of vegetable life at the very commencement of the era of which we have any geological record.[192] ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{department}} of anatomy and development, a host of accurate and patient inquirers, aided by novel methods of preparation, which enable the anatomist to exhaust the details of visible structure and to reproduce them with geometrical precision, have investigated every important group of living animals and plants, {{no less than the}} fossil relics of former faunæ and floræ. An enormous addition has thus been made to our knowledge, especially of the lower forms of life, and it may be said that morphology, however inexhaustible in detail, is complete in its broad features. Classification, which is merely a convenient summary expression of morphological facts, has undergone a corresponding improvement. The breaks which formerly separated our groups from one another, as animals from plants, vertebrates from invertebrates, <b>cryptogams</b> from phanerogams, have either been filled up, or shown to have no theoretical significance. The question of the position of man, as an animal, has given rise to much disputation, with the result of proving that there is no anatomical or developmental character by which he is more widely distinguished from the group of animals most nearly allied to him, than they are from one another. In fact, in this particular, the classification of Linnæus has been proved to be more in accordance with the facts than those of most of his successors.|$|E

40|$|Changing {{temperature}} {{regimes and}} precipitation {{patterns in the}} Subarctic will impact on vegetation composition and diversity including those of bryophyte and lichen communities, which are major drivers of high-latitude carbon and nutrient cycling and hydrology. 2. We investigated {{the relative importance of}} such impacts at different temporal, spatial and plant functional scales in subarctic Sphagnum fuscum-dominated peatlands, comprising both an in situ warming experiment and natural climatic and topographic gradients in northern Sweden and Norway. We applied multivariate analyses to investigate the relationships among <b>cryptogam</b> and vascular plant species composition and abiotic (temperature, moisture) and biotic (Sphagnum growth) regimes at various scales. 3. At the short-term temporal scale (4 -year warming experiment), increased temperature yielded no clear effect on <b>cryptogam</b> or vascular plant species composition. Spatially, direct effects of temperature were decisive for overall species composition across regions (macro-scale) rather than within one region (meso-scale). Moisture and Sphagnum growth were drivers of species composition at all spatial scales, and Sphagnum growth itself depended on its position on the microtopographic gradient and on temperature. 4. Grouping of bryophytes and lichens at increasing scales of functional aggregation from species, growth form to the major higher taxon level (Sphagnum, other mosses, liverworts, lichens) revealed mostly increasing correlation with climate regimes and Sphagnum growth. Excluding liverworts from the analysis tended to reduce the correlation. 5. Abundances of lichens, liverworts, non-Sphagnum mosses and (to a lesser degree) vascular plants were negatively related to Sphagnum abundance. Few <b>cryptogam</b> and vascular plant species showed a positive relationship with Sphagnum abundance. Correspondingly, <b>cryptogam</b> species richness and Shannon Index on peatlands strongly declined as Sphagnum abundance increased, while indices for vascular plants showed no significant relationship. 6. Synthesis. Scale, be it spatial or functional, strongly determined which environmental drivers showed the clearest relationships with vegetation composition and diversity. Our findings will help to optimize predictions about long-term effects of climate on peatland vegetation composition, and subsequently its feedbacks to carbon and water cycles, at the regional scale. © 2009 British Ecological Society...|$|R

40|$|Numbers of {{red deer}} (Cervus elaphus) in the Highlands {{have more than}} doubled in the last few decades and {{conservation}} organisations have expressed concern over their potential impacts on the natural heritage. Bryophytes and lichens represent a substantial component of Scottish biodiversity and northwest Scotland has <b>cryptogam</b> assemblages that are rare elsewhere in the world. Few studies have separated the impacts of red deer from those of sheep and none has focused on the response of important bryophyte and lichen assemblages to red deer management. This thesis has started to address this shortfall in scientific knowledge. Research was centred at Letterewe and neighbouring estates near Loch Maree, Wester Ross where there has been no sheep grazing for decades. Existing exclosures were used to compare blocks of <b>cryptogam</b> communities associated with specific habitats either side of the deer fence. In this way bryophyte and lichen species cover, diversity, dominance and richness associated with low-lying siliceous rocks, globally rare wet heath/bog and the internationally important epiphytic Lobarion lichen community were investigated. Other approaches involved comparing <b>cryptogam</b> communities found on boulder tops inaccessible to red deer with those that were accessible, attempting to correlate red deer dung densities with localised impact to liverwort-rich oceanic heath and by contrasting summit moss-heath vegetation between two estates that have different mean deer densities. Liverworts associated with the mixed hepatic mat were also compared either side of a long-standing deer fence at Knoydart.

40|$|ABSTRACT. To {{support the}} {{determination}} of hydrophytic vegetation in wetland delineations in Alaska, USA, {{a series of tests}} were conducted to develop a group of “test positive ” species to be used in a “cryptogam indicator. ” In 2004, non-vascular <b>cryptogam</b> species (bryophytes, lichens, and fungi) from Interior and South-Central Alaska in the vicinities of Fairbanks and Anchorage were collected at a series of ten 50 × 50 cm plots along two 30 m transects in each of six upland and five wetland sites. Nineteen moss and liverwort species were selected from 86 species surveyed to test for wetland fidelity. In 2005, a plot-based analysis of frequency and cover data yielded a revised list of 17 bryophyte species that were specific to wetland communities dominated by black spruce, Picea mariana (P. Mill.) B. S. P. Fungi and lichens were found to be inadequate wetland indicators in the sampled locations because the lichen species were sparsely distributed and the fungi were too ephemeral. The <b>cryptogam</b> indicator was thus restricted to bryophytes. Also in 2005, bryophytes were analyzed for their presence on microtopographic positions within the landscape, including tops of hummocks and hollows at the bases of hummocks. Upland bryophyte species were found on hummock tops inside the wetland boundary, but were not abundant in the hollows (p < 0. 05). The fidelity of the species selected for use in the <b>cryptogam</b> indicator was tested. It was determined that if more than 50 % of all bryophyte cover present in hollows is composed of {{one or more of the}} 17 wetland bryophytes tested in 2005, then vascular vegetation can be considered to be hydrophytic (p < 0. 001) ...|$|R
