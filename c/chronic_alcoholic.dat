Tuberculin testing of 98 inmates revealed that 80. 6 % of the <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> and 33. 3 % of the other offenders had positive skin tests.

40|$|Objective: To {{carry out}} a {{comprehensive}} study on gastrointestinal symptoms, motility and autonomic neuropathy in <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> before and one year after abstinence. Methods: Dyspeptic symptoms (questionnaires), fasting and postprandial gallbladder and gastric motility (ultrasonography), oro-cecal transit time (lactulose H 2 -breath test), stool form score (indirect marker of colonic transit), and autonomic neuropathy (sweat spot test, R-R ratio) were assessed at baseline in 268 subjects (136 <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> and 132 healthy controls). A subgroup of 39 patients was re-evaluated after 12 months of abstinence. Results: <b>Chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> had increased dyspepsia, delayed gastric emptying and oro-cecal transit time but faster gallbladder emptying, with slightly accelerated colonic transit. Sympathetic, but not parasympathetic, autonomic dysfunction was found. Dyspeptic symptoms and functional alterations of gastric emptying and oro-cecal transit tests were still present after 12 -month abstinence, whereas gallbladder motility, stool form score and sympathetic function improved. Conclusions: <b>Chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> exhibit combined and interdependent presence of dyspeptic symptoms, impaired motility {{at different levels of}} the gastrointestinal tract, with sympathetic dysfunction. Only a few of these abnormalities improve after one year of abstinence from alcohol...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Alcohol {{abuse is}} a known social problem world wide.

40|$|Blood vitamin status (B 1, B 2 and B 6) was {{assessed}} by erythrocytic enzyme activation tests in 7 male and 1 female <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> (mean age (±s. d.), 43 · 12 (13 · 7) years; range, 25 - 64 years) on admission and 6 hr later {{on the same day}} after oral administration of a single dose of polyvitamin. Seven out of 8 patients were found to be deficient in vitamin B 1, 5 in B 6 and none in B 2. But after single-dose oral therapy, tendency to improvement of blood vitamin status was clearly evident in all patients.

40|$|In 34 <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics,</b> {{subdivided}} {{into two groups}} {{according to the state}} of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH), beta-endorphin (beta-EP), ACTH and cortisol levels were determined in basal conditions in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Hormonal concentrations were correlated with brain damage and mnesic function. The results indicate the reduced CSF beta-EP content in <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> and suggest that peripheral beta-EP may penetrate into the CSF compartment when there is BBB damage. They also sustain the different origins of central and peripheral pro-opiocortin-related peptides, and support the concept that beta-EP, beta-LPH and ACTH may be autonomously regulated at the central level. Moreover, both morphological brain damage and mnesic impairment in <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> are unrelated to CSF peptide levels.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between three types of norms and chronic alcoholism. Three types of norms&mdash; proscriptive, prescriptive, and nonscriptive&mdash; were used as categories to investigate the norms of American <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics.</b> Five sources of norms were used to identify the reference groups who were perceived as influencing the alcoholics’ drinking patterns. The reference groups included co-workers, church, family, friends, and parents. Among 85 American subjects, chronic alcoholism tended to be highest in a proscriptive environment, lower in a prescriptive environment, and lowest in a nonscriptive environment. Proscriptive norms were those which were perceived as stating directly that a person should not drink excessively at all. The sources of the proscriptive norms were analyzed. Church and parents were found to be the perceived sources of proscriptive norms for the <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> studied.

40|$|ABSTRACT Serum {{homocysteine}} concentrations {{have been}} shown to be a sensitive functional indicator of intracellular folate, vitamin B- 12, and vitamin B- 6 status. Chronic alcoholism is known to interfere with one-carbon metabolism, for which the above vitamins serve as coenzymes. In the present study, these vitamins were assessed in 32 <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> and 3 1 healthy volunteers by measuring blood vitamin concentrations as well as serum homocysteine concentrations. In <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics,</b> serum pyridoxal 5 ’-phosphate and red blood cell folate concentrations were significantly lower than in the control subjects (P < 0. 00 1 and P = 0. 008, respectively). Mean serum homocysteine was twice as high in <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> than in nondrinkers (P < 0. 001). Beer consumers had significantly lower concentrations of homocysteine compared with drinkers of wine or spirits (P = 0. 05). These results suggest that by interfering with folate or vitamin B- 6 metabolism, chronic alcohol intake may impair the disposal of homocysteine through the transmethylation or transsulfuratio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Standardized {{investigations}} on resting {{heart rate}} variability (HRV) should provide more information on acamprosate's human pharmacodynamic properties because acamprosate interacts with several neurotransmitter systems which are also involved in maintaining autonomic neurocardiac balance. We performed HRV measurements prospectively in 69 healthy controls and 19 <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> to prove the hypotheses that: (1) compared to healthy controls, <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> show disturbances in neurocardiac vagal function; and (2) in alcoholics, acamprosate treatment (6 - 8 days) should further decrease parasympathetic activity if acamprosate interacts with central y-aminobutyric acidA receptors in vivo. Cardiovagal dysfunction was initially present in 21 % of the alcoholics. After treatment, however, their neurocardiac sympathetic-parasympathetic balance improved significantly...|$|R
40|$|S UMM A R Y Twenty {{cases of}} pellagra, {{diagnosed}} on neuropathological grounds, were found among 74 necropsy cases of chronic alcoholism. Although these patients had presented with various mental, neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms, {{the diagnosis of}} pellagra had not been established clinically because, in the majority, there were no skin lesions. It is emphasised that whenever <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> exhibit certain mental, neurological or gastrointestinal symp-toms, one should strongly suspect pellagra {{even in the absence}} of skin lesions (pellagra sine pelle agra). Pellagra is a disease caused primarily by niacin deficiency. It is characterised by the classical triad of dermatitis, diarrhoea and dementia. If un-treated, patients eventually die. Some people there-fore add "death " to the triad, thus making " 4 D's". Nowadays, the disease has virtually disappeared in developed countries, except in association with chronic alcoholism. The conspicuous association between severe alcoholism and pellagra has been commented upon clinically by many previous workers. 1 - 4 We found 20 cases showing neuropathological features of pellagra among 74 <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> who came to necropsy. The pellagra had not been suspected clinically, because of the absence of characteristic skin manifestations. The aim of this paper is to show the clinical and pathological find-ings of these cases of niacin-deficiency encephalo-pathy and to call attention to "pellagra sine pelle agra " among <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics.</b> Cases and methods Between 1965 to 1979, 758 <b>chronic</b> <b>alcoholics</b> were admitted to our hospital.
