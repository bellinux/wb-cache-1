40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method {{to examine the}} performance evaluation of mutual funds in incomplete markets. Based on the no arbitrage condition, we develop bounds on admissible performance measures. We suggest new ways of ranking mutual funds and provide a diagnostic instrument for evaluating the admissibility of candidate performance measures. Using a monthly sample of 320 equity funds, we show that admissible performance values can vary widely, supporting the casual observation that investors disagree on the evaluation of mutual funds. In particular, we cannot rule out that more than 80 % of the mutual funds are given positive values by some investors. Moreover, we empirically demonstrate that potential inference errors embedded in existing parametric performance measures <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>important</b> magnitude.

For cingulum analysis from diffusion tensor MR imaging, tractography and tract of interest method {{have been adopted}} for tract-based analysis. Because tractography performs fiber tracking according to local diffusion measures, they can be sensitive to noise and tracking errors can be accumulated along the fiber. For more accurate localization of cingulum, we attempt to define it by skeleton extraction using the tensors' information throughout the tract of cingulum simultaneously, which {{is quite different from}} the idea of tractography. In this study, we introduce an approach to extract the skeleton of cingulum using active contour model, which allows us to optimize the location of cingulum in a global sense based on the diffusion measurements along the entire tract and contour regularity. Validation of this method on synthetic and experimental data proved that our approach is able to reduce the influence of noise and partial volume effect, and extract the skeleton of cingulum robustly and reliably. Our proposed method provides an approach to localize cingulum robustly, which is a very important feature for tract-based analysis and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>important</b> practical utility...|$|E

In the present study, the in vitro tests were undertaken to evaluate {{the effect of these}} electric currents on the activity of the proteolytic pancreatic digestive enzymes. A simulator generating the typical electrical activity of pig gut was used for these studies. The electric current emitted by the simulator was transmitted to the samples, containing enzyme and its substrate, using platinum plate electrodes. All samples were incubated at 37 degrees C for I h. The changes in optical density, corresponding to enzyme activity, in samples stimulated for I h with ELEC was compared with that not exposed to ELEC. The obtained results show that the electrical current with the characteristics of the myoelectrical migrating complex (MMC) has an influence on pancreatic enzyme activity. Increased endopeptidase and reduced exopeptidase activity was noticed in samples treated with ELEC.

Variation in the gene (CYP 1 A 2) has been reported to be associated with differential efficacy of therapeutic drugs and adverse drug reactions. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the extent of variation in the coding and exonflanking non-coding regions of CYP 1 A 2, 762 chromosomes from members of five ethnic groups (Afar, Amhara, Anuak, Maale and Oromo) distributed in a rough north east to south west transect across Ethiopia were re-sequenced. Substantial variation was observed, much of which was novel. As a consequence, a diagnostic test based on previously known variation cannot predict functional variation in Ethiopians. Evidence of purifying selection acting on CYP 1 A 2 was found and coalescent date estimates of CYP 1 A 2 variants were old, with many pre-dating expansions of anatomically modern human out of Africa. Variants within the transcription factor 7 -like 2 gene (TCF 7 L 2), which are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T 2 D), were common in multiple Ethiopian populations. TCF 7 L 2 haplotype distribution varied among groups suggesting that T 2 D susceptibility may also vary, with most groups likely having a West African TCF 7 L 2 risk for the disease and some having more of a European TCF 7 L 2 risk. Many CYP 1 A 2 and TCF 7 L 2 haplotypes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>important</b> predictive value in the planning and provision of healthcare. These findings are not only of benefit to native Ethiopians, but are also of increasing importance in the planning of healthcare intervention in the developed world, where growing numbers of individuals with recent Ethiopian descent are living.

There is a necessity for knowing what the future holds. Following sustainable development companies has begun to adopt standardized environmental management systems like EMAS and ISO 14001. The companies that use scenario methods are often companies that also use environmental management and standardized management systems, which also is the case in this study. The aim of the study is to examine how future oriented studies can be used to develop the environmental strategic arena, by suggesting possible work procedures. The aim is also to describe how different future studies and techniques theoretically can be used within the strategic environmental area and to examine the use of future studies within different companies. Four Semi-structured interviews were made with companies that both use EMS and future studies. The interviews and the theoretical framework in study were used to answer the aim. The results indicate that company future studies only {{have an effect on the}} market area and not the company EMS, the influence at the best is only indirect. The companies are more focused on factors that can change the market and economical aspects surrounding their products and services, than on factors that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>important</b> in making strategic important decisions about the appearance {{of the future}} environmental arena.

Forecasting can help the user in the beginning of the planning process of EMS, with its short term visions the user can create an understanding about which way to go and this can then be complemented with backcasting. External scenarios used in the other three companies should be able to be integrated with the environmental area of the companies.

Methods: Retrospective chart review. Out of 33 patients with SMCP, who were registered by the Groninger cleft lip and palate team of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) over approximately 20 years (1990 until July 2011), 29 nonsyndromic patients with a proven diagnosis of SMCP were included in this study: 17 males and 12 females. From these patients, speech and hearing were examined as part of the routine diagnostic and treatment protocol on communicative abilities. The number of patients with SMCP and the age at time of diagnosis were evaluated. The percentages of problems in resonance, articulation and hearing, present at time of diagnosis, were compared with the percentages of problems found after surgical treatment. Results: Out of 800 patients with clefts, 29 patients (4 %) were diagnosed with SMCP. SMCP was initially diagnosed at a median age of 3; 8 years (0; 0 - 42; 3 years). All patients presented {{one or more of the}} following symptomatic complaints at time of diagnosis: hypernasality (66 %), problems in articulation (45 %), conductive hearing loss (38 %) and / or nutritional problems (31 %). A typical anatomical variation of the palate was a bifid uvula (96 %). Following surgery, a hypernasal speech and nutritional problems were no longer observed. The articulation problems remained persistent after plastic surgery and the age of diagnosis appeared to be no significant predictor of these articulation problems. Hearing problems appeared more difficult to treat effectively. An improvement in hearing was observed but normal hearing was not achieved. During the intervening period, often a combination of treatments was performed. Pharyngoplasty appeared to be successful in treating hypernasality, with a success rate of 78 % after 1 operation and 100 % after 2 operations. Conclusion: SMCP is a rare cleft of the palate which is, despite symptoms of velopharyngeal insufficiency and the presence of a bifid uvula, often diagnosed late. The age at time of diagnosis has only lasting consequences for speech development with regard to problems in articulation. Hearing problems are more difficult to treat effectively on the long term. Recommended is to examine throat, nose and ears in children with obvious anatomical variations of the palate and mild problems in speech, hearing and / or nutrition. In this examination, assessment of the velum <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>important</b> diagnostic value because these problems can be caused by a submucous cleft of the palate. ...|$|E
40|$|Musculoskeletal pain {{disorder}} (MSD) is {{a common}} cause for long-term work absenteeism among {{both women and men}} in the western world, including the Nordic countries. Musicians represent a profession highly afflicted with pain disorders, especially the areas of the neck, shoulder, arm, hand and the upper and lower back. During the last decades an abundant amount of research has reported associations between MSD and motor control disturbances. Common findings include altered neuromuscular coordination and reduced movement precision, as well as reduced strength, endurance and mobility. These disturbances can be of importance for recurrence and duration of the disorders, but also for work ability. Presumably, this can be of specific significance, with risk for absenteeism among professions with high demands on motor control. Musicians are highly dependent on fine motor control, such as fast and accurate finger movements, as well as postural and muscular endurance. Although the amount of research on motor control in pain disorders is extensive, only a few studies have investigated sensorimotor functions among musicians with musculoskeletal pain disorders. Altered posture has been reported, where one study reported dysfunction of the postural stability systems of the low back, shoulder and neck among musicians with playing related disorders (1). However, this study lacked an asymptomatic control group. A couple of studies have reported increased sensorimotor disturbances of the hand and arm among music students with symptoms compared to asymptomatic controls (2, 3). A few studies have investigated muscle activity of superficial neck-shoulder muscles in musicians with neck pain while playing the violin or viola, but the results are incoherent reporting both increased and reduced muscle activity, e. g. (4, 5). Taken together, altered motor control appears to be a concern for musicians with playing related MSD. There is, though, a need for further investigation into motor control functioning among musicians and the association with MSD, especially whilst playing musical instrument. Increased insights in this area <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>important</b> value for prevention and rehabilitation strategies. References 1. Steinmetz A et al.

Experiments <b>were</b> carried out to study the ability of GAGs to inhibit the adhesion of two intestinal micro-organisms (enteropathogenic Escherichia coli serotype 0119 and Salmonella fyris) to Caco- 2 and Int- 407 cell lines. RESULTS: The study showed that the GAGs had an anti-adhesive effect on the two pathogenic strains studied with different degrees of inhibition. In particular, in the presence of human milk GAGs, the adhesion of S. fyris to Caco- 2 cells and to Int- 407 cells of both tested strains was significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that GAGs in human milk <b>can</b> <b>be</b> one <b>of</b> the <b>important</b> defensive factors against acute diarrheal infections in breast-fed infants...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the study of recent {{scientific}} literature about the development of attachment, the author answers the following questions: which are the postulates the theory of attachment has about the stability of the patterns of attachment, which level of stability in the patterns of attachment from infancy to adulthood these studies illuminate and which factors significantly influence the (in) stability of the patterns of attachment in time. The theory of attachment assumes that normal circumstances elicit stability. Changes, however, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> the result <b>of</b> <b>important</b> events influencing the sensitivity of the object of attachment. Agreement has not yet been reached regarding the percentage of stability in the patterns <b>of</b> attachment. There <b>is</b> more agreement regarding attachment in adulthood than that in childhood. The results depend on the size and characteristics of the subjects of the research, the measuring instruments, type of data analysis etc. The author concludes that attachment is a dynamic system influenced by significant changes in life (the cognitive development of the child, external care, parents&# 39; divorce, different stressful situations). As the influence of stressful events on the individual person&# 39; s quality <b>of</b> attachment <b>is</b> examined, it is necessary to consider also his&# 47;her temperamental characteristics, role of other people in their lives, etc...|$|R
40|$|Public {{sector is}} being {{currently}} under intensified pressure {{to increase efficiency}} and improve quality of its activity. The pressure of government, local society, stake holders and media stimulates public sector development and motivates to experiment with new management methods. In the article basic premises of comparative analysis of public sector institutions efficiency are presented. In the global studies on comparative analysis of efficiency the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is the leading method applied. In the article the general concept and key features of the DEA method are described. The examples of DEA implementation in different areas of public sector worldwide are presented. The conclusion is formulated that undertaking similar studies in Polish environment is justified. Considerations are illustrated with the calculation of Polish public technical universities efficiency. In the DEA model proposed the didactic subsidy comprises the input {{and the number of}} students and scientific grants is treated as the output. It is indicated {{that the majority of the}} universities under scrutiny possesses reserves of technical and allocative efficiency. The authors are convinced that the comparative analysis <b>of</b> efficiency <b>can</b> <b>be</b> one <b>of</b> the <b>important</b> stimulators <b>of</b> public service quality, public spending and public institutions management improvement. DEA method, efficiency, public sector, higher education institution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Proper and {{effective}} Software Project Management (SPM) {{is usually the}} most important factor in the outcome of a project for many companies in “modern graphical printing industry production ” (MGPIP) and their project engineers and managers [7]. Article opens new analytical directions for proper management of the software project in MGPIP, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> one <b>of</b> the <b>important</b> reasons for success. By using effective project management techniques a project manager can improve the chances of success in graphical printing production. Problem is how to analytically combine these techniques into a practical and best effective workable process? For effective solution one need a balanced process that covers the management and production of the entire project from inception to completion. This work proposes that only few simulation models (and stochastic simulations) can analytically (and on scientific research basis) solve specific management and engineering organisational, controlling and monitoring problems of SPM in MGPIP. Mentioned simulation models are bases for simulations of components of whole graphical production process, from digital records arrivals to finished printing plate. Why to simulate components of whole graphical production process, from digital records arrivals to finished printing plate? Possible important answer is that nowadays MGPIP is in a time of big changing of (especially “mass printing”) production technology in a way of to integration traditional printing with digital printing, and moving in the space of digital printing fo...|$|R
40|$|In {{semi-arid}} regions, variability <b>of</b> rainfall inputs <b>is</b> high {{at different}} {{time and space}} scales. Thus, intense and highly variable hydro-meteorological events, which generate both potential resource and hazards, <b>are</b> <b>of</b> major interest. The Merguellil watershed {{is characterized by a}} large majority of rainfall in the form of storms, particularly violent in spring and autumn. Storms <b>of</b> summer <b>are</b> short and violent and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> the origin <b>of</b> <b>important</b> floods. Due to the strong rainfall variability, precipitation and hydrological regime are very irregular. This is what led us to think of a detailed study of rainy events. It was founded that two statistical distributions of parameters characterizing events are dominated (log normal, exponential). Thus, our objective consists in studying, in its globality, the collected pluviographic data {{in order to make a}} synthesis and analysis which should make it possible the generation of fictitious events to better control the rainfall risk and to study the response of the watershed faces to several types of rainfall. As result, we obtained hyetographs of the height studied rain gauges. These hyetographs show several types <b>of</b> events that <b>are</b> well in conformity with the observed reality. This generation is an advantageous tool in terms of both its robustness and its performance. Its relevance is based on the analysis of the fine time structure of recorded rainfall events. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> made over several years, and would permit us to avoid being constrained by sample size. Generating rainfall events provides extensive time-related rainfall data that are consistent at all time steps, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen as solution, even partially, of data lack in hydrological study...|$|R
40|$|Diabetic foot {{ulceration}} {{is a major}} complication {{for patients}} with diabetes mellitus. If not adequately treated, these ulcers may lead to foot infection, and ultimately to lower extremity amputation, which imposes a major burden to society and great loss in health-related {{quality of life for}} patients. Early identification and subsequent preventive treatment have proven useful to limit the incidence of foot ulcers and lower extremity amputation. Thus, the development of new diagnosis tools has become an attractive option. The ultimate objective <b>of</b> our project <b>is</b> to develop an intelligent telemedicine monitoring system for frequent examination on patients’ feet, to timely detect pre-signs of ulceration. Inflammation in diabetic feet <b>can</b> <b>be</b> an early and predictive warning sign for ulceration, and temperature has been proven to be a vicarious marker for inflammation. Studies have indicated that infrared dermal thermography <b>of</b> foot soles <b>can</b> <b>be</b> one <b>of</b> the <b>important</b> parameters for assessing the risk of diabetic foot ulceration. This paper covers the feasibility study of using an infrared camera, FLIR SC 305, in our setup, to acquire the spatial thermal distribution on the feet soles. With the obtained thermal images, automated detection through image analysis was performed to identify the abnormal increased/decreased temperature and assess the risk for ulceration. The thermography for feet soles of patients with diagnosed diabetic foot complications were acquired before the ordinary foot examinations. Assessment from clinicians and thermography were compared and follow-up measurements were performed to investigate the prediction. A preliminary case study will be presented, indicating that dermal thermography in our proposed setup <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a screening modality to timely detect pre-signs of ulceration...|$|R
