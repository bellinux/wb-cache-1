40|$|This eleborate {{study is}} aimed at {{analysis}} of complete methods machining. There are characterized particular methods and their effect on the surfaceÂ´s quality of machined area in this study. Concluding {{part of the study}} includes practical demonstration of machining by using cemented <b>carbide-tipped</b> <b>tool</b> and polycrystalline diamond and evaluation of this demonstration...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of cutting tools nanostructured coatings on {{the parameters of}} machined parts surface layer has been researched. The interaction between friction characteristics of coated tools and shear plane angle during machining has been determined. The results of different materials cutting with coated <b>carbide-tipped</b> <b>tools</b> have been shown...|$|R
50|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of cement board is the weight per square foot. It is approximately {{twice that of}} gypsum board, making handling by one person difficult. Cutting of cement board must also be done with <b>carbide-tipped</b> <b>tools</b> and saw blades. Due to its hardness, pre-drilling of fasteners is often recommended. Finally, cement board is initially more expensive than water resistant gypsum board but may provide better long term value.|$|R
40|$|Simple tool reduces set-up and {{machining}} time {{by more than}} 70 percent. Unorthodox tooling arrangement used to machine three prongs on end of specialpurpose wrench. Modified <b>carbide-tipped</b> spot-facing <b>tool</b> rotated at 1, 400 to 1, 600 revolutions per minute in small milling machine and applied to work piece, held with its corners in spaces of three-cornered collect...|$|R
40|$|The use of TiN {{coatings}} {{on cutting}} tools for general ferrous machining applications to enhance tool life and increase productivity is now well established. However, application of coatings to the <b>carbide-tipped</b> cutting <b>tools</b> using the PVD {{process is a}} new activity. In this investigation a new experimental approach was used, in which TiN coatings were applied to carbide-tipped circular saw segments. The four cathode PVD technique was used for deposition at a low coating temperature. This results in a fine-grain, thin, hard film with excellent adherence to the substrate. When deposited on tools, coating acts as a chemical and thermal barrier between the tool and workpiece. Applications including machining mild steel and stainless steel benefit from the coating. Comparison between coated carbide-tipped circular saws and uncoated carbide-tipped circular saws is presented. The cutting test results have shown that TiN-coated carbide-tipped circular saws presented much better performance and longer tool life than the uncoated saws. This information will be useful {{in the development of}} a coating system applied to the carbide-tipped circular saw using PVD...|$|R
