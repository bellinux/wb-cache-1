Gata 3 was shown in the chicken to be an <b>enhancer-binding</b> <b>protein</b> containing a zinc-finger domain. We have isolated a full-length human Gata 3 cDNA and characterized its role in TCR gene regulation. Northern blot analysis showed that the Gata 3 mRNA is present in T-cell, but not B-cell, macrophage or HeLa cell lines. The in vitro transcribed and translated Gata 3 cDNA product bound specifically to the enhancer elements of at least three TCR genes containing the above consensus sequence. This binding specificity was consistent with the in vivo activity of the TCR enhancer-binding element in transient transfection assays. Hence, the Gata 3 protein, together with other T-cell-specific <b>enhancer-binding</b> <b>proteins,</b> may form the basis of tissue-specific expression of the TCR genes...|$|R

40|$|Eukaryotic <b>enhancer-binding</b> <b>proteins</b> {{are often}} modular in design {{in that they}} are {{composed}} of physically separable domains that can function independently of one another (18, 46, 55). Detailed analyses have identified regions involved in specific DNA recognition and others involved in activation of transcription.

As outlined below, members of a family of prokaryotic <b>enhancer-binding</b> <b>proteins</b> are also modular in structure. However, one member of the family, the NTRC protein (nitrogen regulatory protein C; also called NRI) of enteric bacteria, is apparently an exception.

40|$|Control of {{transcription}} in prokaryotes {{often involves}} direct contact of regulatory proteins with RNA polymerase from binding sites located {{adjacent to the}} target promoter. Alternatively, {{in the case of}} genes transcribed by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the alternate sigma factor ς 54, regulatory proteins bound at more distally located enhancer sites can activate transcription via DNA looping by taking advantage of the increasing flexibility of DNA over longer distances. While this second mechanism offers a greater possible flexibility in the location of these binding sites, {{it is not clear how}} the specificity offered by the proximity of the regulatory protein and the polymerase intrinsic to the first mechanism is maintained. Here we demonstrate that integration host factor (IHF), a protein that induces a sharp bend in DNA, acts both to inhibit DNA-looping-dependent transcriptional activation by an inappropriate <b>enhancer-binding</b> <b>protein</b> and to facilitate similar activation by an appropriate <b>enhancer-binding</b> <b>protein.</b> These opposite effects have the consequence of increasing the specificity of activation of a promoter that is susceptible to regulation by proteins bound to a distal site...|$|R

The extracts showed a dose-dependent antioxidant activity in all tests. AE was the most potent antioxidant in copper and ferric ion chelation assays, whereas AE-D was the most potent in superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays, reducing power assay, and total antioxidant capacity analysis. Only ME showed a cytotoxic effect against 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. Lipid accumulation decreased in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes in the presence of AE and AE-D extracts (0. 5 to 1. 0 mg/mL).

Many developmentally regulated genes in M. xanthus are transcribed from σ 54 promoters, and these genes require <b>enhancer-binding</b> <b>proteins.</b> Here we report the finding of an unusual group of 12 genes encoding σ 54 -dependent <b>enhancer-binding</b> <b>proteins</b> containing a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain as their N-terminal sensory domain. FHA domains in other proteins recognize phosphothreonine residues. An insertion mutation in one of these genes, Mx 4885, caused a cell autonomous aggregation and sporulation defect. In-frame deletion mutants showed that the FHA domain is necessary for proper Mx 4885 function. The altered pattern of developmental gene expression in the mutant implied that Mx 4885 is on the pathway of {{response to}} the morphogenetic C-signal. Immunoblots specific for C-signal and FruA imply that the site of Mx 4885 action is downstream of FruA synthesis on the C-signal transduction pathway.

Here, we examine the relationship between E 2 A DNA binding activity and activation of the endogenous, chromosomal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus. Using sterile I(mu) transcription as an indicator of IgH enhancer activity, we see a direct correlation between E 2 A DNA binding activity and I(mu) transcription in stable BxT hybrids. We also observe a 1000 -fold stimulation of endogenous I(mu) transcription in fibroblasts that express high levels of E 47 and less stimulation in cells that express E 12.

The microaerobic induction of the prxS-rpoN 2 operon is mediated by the alternative sigma factor RpoN and the <b>enhancer-binding</b> <b>protein</b> NifA. The RpoN-dependent promoter is also active under low-nitrogen conditions through the <b>enhancer-binding</b> <b>protein</b> NtrC. An additional symbiosis-specific weak promoter is located between prxS and rpoN 2. Constitutive expression of prxS confers enhanced survival and growth to R. etli {{in the presence of}} H 2 O 2. Single prxS mutants are not affected in their symbiotic abilities or defence response against oxidative stress under free-living conditions. In contrast, a prxS katG double mutant has a significantly reduced (> 40 %) nitrogen fixation capacity, suggesting a functional redundancy between PrxS and KatG, a bifunctional catalase-peroxidase. In vitro assays demonstrate the reduction of PrxS protein by DTT and thioredoxin. PrxS displays substrate specificity towards H 2 O 2 (Km = 62 microM) over alkyl hydroperoxides (Km > 1 mM). Peroxidase activity is abolished in both the peroxidatic (C 56) and resolving (C 156) cysteine PrxS mutants, while the conserved C 81 residue is required for proper folding of the protein.

De novo mutation of CHD 7 is {{a major cause of}} CHARGE syndrome, a genetic condition characterized by multiple congenital anomalies. To gain insights to the function of CHD 7, we used the technique of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to map CHD 7 sites in mouse ES cells. We identified 10, 483 sites on chromatin bound by CHD 7 at high confidence. Most of the CHD 7 sites show features of gene enhancer elements. Specifically, CHD 7 sites are predominantly located distal to transcription start sites, contain high levels of H 3 K 4 mono-methylation, found within open chromatin that is hypersensitive to DNase I digestion, and correlate with ES cell-specific gene expression. Moreover, CHD 7 co-localizes with P 300, a known <b>enhancer-binding</b> <b>protein</b> and strong predictor of enhancer activity. Correlations with 18 other factors mapped by ChIP-seq in mouse ES cells indicate that CHD 7 also co-localizes with ES cell master regulators OCT 4, SOX 2, and NANOG. Correlations between CHD 7 sites and global gene expression profiles obtained from Chd 7 (+/+), Chd 7 (+/-), and Chd 7 (-/-) ES cells indicate that CHD 7 functions at enhancers as a transcriptional rheostat to modulate, or fine-tune the expression levels of ES-specific genes. CHD 7 can modulate genes in either the positive or negative direction, although negative regulation appears to be the more direct effect of CHD 7 binding. These data indicate that <b>enhancer-binding</b> <b>proteins</b> can limit gene expression and are not necessarily co-activators.

Equilibrium binding studies indicate that the dissociation constants for mu EBP-E binding to site E within the enhancer and to a binding site within the V 1 heavy-chain promoter are quite low, about 2 x 10 (- 11) M. Comparison of four mu EBP-E recognition sequences detects only limited sequence similarity among binding sites...|$|R
