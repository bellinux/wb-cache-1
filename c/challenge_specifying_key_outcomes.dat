The evidence base has been constrained by inadequate understanding {{of the theory of}} change behind the policy intervention, insufficient development of evaluation theory and method and a lack of information {{about the impact of the}} interventions on the <b>key</b> <b>outcomes</b> that they are designed to affect. This article seeks to address the third of these limitations—namely, a focus on the impact of ABIs on <b>key</b> <b>outcomes</b> that reflect the quality of life of the people who live in depressed areas. However, it also considers issues relating to the other two key factors. The article illustrates how the impacts of ABIs on <b>key</b> <b>outcomes</b> might be assessed by drawing upon recent findings that have emerged from an evaluation of one of the largest ABI programmes that has been deployed in England, that of the Single Regeneration Budget. 1.

Furthermore, the report indicates that Commerce has made progress toward achieving two of the selected <b>key</b> <b>outcomes.</b> However, progress toward achieving the remaining two outcomes is unclear largely because of weaknesses related to measuring performance. Specifically, some of the measures are output-oriented, rather than outcome oriented; some measures have known limitations, which Commerce acknowledges; many of the measures used to assess performance in the past are being discontinued for the future; and Commerce plans to rely on one, narrowly focused measure to demonstrate progress for each performance goal related to these <b>key</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Furthermore, other data exist within the International Trade Administration (ITA) that could support additional measures related to these performance goals. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{use more}} {{effectively}} the limited resources available for conservation {{there is an}} urgent need to identify which conservation approaches {{are most likely to}} succeed. However, measuring conservation success is often difficult, as it is achieved outside the project time frame. Measures of implementation are often reported to donors to demonstrate achievement but it is unclear whether they really predict conservation success. We applied a conceptual framework and score-card developed by the Cambridge Conservation Forum (CCF) to a sample of 60 conservation activities to determine the predictive power of implementation measures versus measures of <b>key</b> <b>outcomes</b> (later steps in the models defined in the CCF tools). We show that assessing <b>key</b> <b>outcomes</b> is often more difficult than quantifying the degree of implementation of a project but that, while implementation is a poor predictor of success, <b>key</b> <b>outcomes</b> provide a feasible and much more reliable proxy for whether a project will deliver real conservation benefits. The CCF framework and evaluation tool provide a powerful basis for synthesizing past experience and, with wider application, will help to identify factors that affect the success of conservation activities...|$|R
