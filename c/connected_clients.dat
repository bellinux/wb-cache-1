50|$|A game server (also {{sometimes}} referred to as a host) is a server which is the authoritative source of events in a multiplayer video game. The server transmits enough data about its internal state to allow its <b>connected</b> <b>clients</b> to maintain their own accurate version of the game world for display to players. They also receive and process each player's input.|$|E
50|$|Cache invalidation {{can be used}} to push new {{content to}} a client. This method {{functions}} as an alternative to other methods of displaying new content to <b>connected</b> <b>clients.</b> Invalidation is carried out by changing the application data, which in turn marks the information received by the client as out-of-date. After the cache is invalidated, if the client requests the cache, they are delivered a new version.|$|E

5000|$|The POP {{protocol}} {{requires the}} currently connected client {{to be the}} only client connected to the mailbox. In contrast, the IMAP protocol specifically allows simultaneous access by multiple clients and provides mechanisms for clients to detect changes made to the mailbox by other, concurrently <b>connected,</b> <b>clients.</b> See for example RFC3501 section 5.2 which specifically cites [...] "simultaneous access to the same mailbox by multiple agents" [...] as an example.|$|E
50|$|At first, servers were {{isolated}} {{from one another}} as with Napster, but later versions of the eDonkey2000 server software enabled servers to form a search network. This allowed servers to forward search queries from their locally <b>connected</b> <b>clients</b> to other servers, allowing clients to effectively find peers connected to any server on the server network, thereby increasing download swarm size. It also allowed clients to find and download files not available from clients connected to the same server.|$|E

50|$|Each year, the drawn current {{amount of}} <b>connected</b> <b>clients</b> {{since last year}} is determined. This amount must be {{supplied}} no later than the fifth subsequent year of new investments into the German power grid, which are not older than five years or for which construction has initiated the power company. This more current is produced in an environmentally friendly way, {{which one of the}} main points is that makes the transition to a real green electricity provider sensible of also applying this criterion.|$|E
50|$|There are non-modem devices (which {{includes}} smartphones) {{and services}} that can detect CID information. An NCID gateway collects CID data from these other sources and passes {{it on to the}} main NCID server. From there the CID data is distributed to all <b>connected</b> <b>clients,</b> just like CID data collected from a traditional modem. One example of a non-modem device is a VoIP (Voice over IP) service that collects CID data as SIP packets. Another example is the Whozz Calling series of Ethernet Link devices that obtain CID information from multiple POTS (Plain old telephone service) lines.|$|E
50|$|The ANGONIX is a {{physical}} infrastructure through which Internet service providers (ISPs) exchange Internet traffic between their networks. It acts as a traffic aggregating Hub, where <b>connected</b> <b>clients</b> can share content with other providers that are also connected at this point. The purpose of this infrastructure is to improve Internet services for local customers. Often, geographically neighboring clients need to travel long distances {{to be able to}} interconnect, due to the configuration of the network providing them the Internet services. The ANGONIX will minimize these distances for the Angolan Internet users thus improving speed, accessibility and availability at a reduced cost.|$|E

5000|$|Publish/subscribe: This {{is the way}} for {{an object}} to {{announce}} the occurrence of {{a signal to the}} interested parties. The object's service process broadcasts a message that the bus passes only to the <b>connected</b> <b>clients</b> subscribed to the object's signal. The message carries the object path, the name of the signal, the interface to which the signal belongs, and also the values of the signal's parameters (if any). The communication is one-way: there are no response messages to the original message from any client process, since the sender knows neither the identities nor the number of the recipients.|$|E
50|$|Adobe Media Server is a hub. Flash based {{applications}} {{connect to}} the hub using Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP). The server can send and receive data {{to and from the}} connected users with live web FLV player installed. <b>Connected</b> <b>clients</b> can make Remote procedure calls (RPC) on the server-side and the server can call methods on specific clients. A SharedObject can be used to synchronize complicated data structures and call remote methods on multiple clients in one go by having clients subscribe to a shared object. Standard ActionScript objects are transported across the NetConnection using the Action Message Format (AMF) which is handled transparently by the server and flash client.|$|E
5000|$|... ownCloud is a {{suite of}} {{client-server}} software for creating file hosting services and using them. ownCloud is functionally {{very similar to the}} widely used Dropbox, with the primary functional difference being that ownCloud is free and open-source, and thereby allowing anyone to install and operate it without charge on a private server. It also supports extensions that allow it to work like Google Drive, with online document editing, calendar and contact synchronization, and more. Its openness eschews enforced quotas on storage space or the number of <b>connected</b> <b>clients,</b> instead having hard limits (like on storage space or number of users) defined only by the physical capabilities of the server.|$|E
50|$|<b>Connecting</b> <b>clients</b> run pre-installed or {{downloaded}} viewer applications via {{one of many}} {{remote desktop}} protocols. Clients can include thin clients, PCs, workstations, mobile and handheld devices running a variety of operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and others.|$|R

50|$|When {{the server}} daemon is started, It starts up a forker thread (kcifsd/0) at {{initialization}} time and open a dedicated port 445 for listening to SMB requests. Whenever new clients make request, forker thread {{will accept the}} client connection and fork a new thread for dedicated communication channel between the client and the server. It allows for parallel processing of SMB requests (commands) from clients as well as allowing for new clients to make new connections. Each instance is named kcifsd/1~n to indicate <b>connected</b> <b>clients.</b> Depending on the SMB request types, each new thread can decide {{to pass through the}} commands to the user space (cifsd), currently DCE/RPC commands are identified to be handled through the user space.|$|E
50|$|Presence, {{particularly}} MPOP, requires {{collaboration between}} {{a number of}} electronic devices (for example IM client, home phone, cell phone, and electronic calendar) and the presence services each of them are connected with. To date, {{the most common and}} wide-scale implementations use closed systems, with a SPOP (Single Point of Presence, where a single device publishes state). Some vendors have upgraded their services to automatically log out <b>connected</b> <b>clients</b> when a new login request reaches the server from a newly connecting different device. For presence to universally work with MPOP support, multiple devices must be able to not only intercommunicate among each other, the status information must also be appropriately handled by all other interoperable, connected presence services and the MPOP scheme for their clients.|$|E
