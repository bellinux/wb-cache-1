40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an easy-to-use yet {{comprehensive}} {{model for a}} system of cointegrated commodity prices. While retaining the exponential affine structure of previous approaches, our model allows for an arbitrary number of cointegration relationships. We show that the cointegration component allows capturing well-known features of commodity prices, i. e., upward sloping (<b>contango)</b> <b>and</b> downward sloping (<b>backwardation)</b> term-structures, smaller volatilities for longer maturities and an upward sloping correlation term structure. The model is calibrated to futures price data of ten commodities. The results provide compelling evidence of cointegration in the data. Implications for the prices of futures and options written on common commodity spreads (e. g., spark spread and crack spread) are thoroughly investigated...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new factor {{model for the}} term structure of futures prices of commodities. This model fills {{a gap in the}} literature by providing not only flexibility on the deterministic drivers of the term structure’s (TS) curve but also a clear meaning of the stochastic factors implied by the model. These benefits allow the user of the model to predict, and to protect himself against, changes in the slope and concavity of the TS curve. In particular, these new factors are identified as the spot price, the slope and the concavity of the curve, and they directly tackle the phenomena defined as <b>contango</b> <b>and</b> <b>backwardation</b> movements. It is shown that the model provides a good fit for the term structure’s curve under the historical measure. Conditions on the processes of the factors are obtained under an equivalent measure which ensures an absence of arbitrage. Explicit expressions for the term structure of volatilities and correlations are also provided. The paper concludes with a set of derivatives inspired by the new factors which could be used to protect an investor against <b>contango</b> <b>and</b> <b>backwardation</b> movements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This study {{analyses}} {{the market}} behavior and price discovery in Indian Agriculture Commodity Markets. Commodity future trading was permitted in 2003. The commodity derivatives market in India has witnessed a phenomenal growth. The functioning of future market came under scrutiny during 2008 - 2009 due to price rise {{and the role}} of futures market in stabilizing spot prices was widely studied. The study considered average monthly spot and future prices of nine agriculture commodities viz. wheat, chana, soybean oil, jute, mentha oil,rubber, potato, crude palm oil and cardamom trading on MCX and NCDEX during 2009 - 2010. Granger causality test have been used to test the price discovery i. e., the effect of future market on spot market and vice-versa. The market behavior was studied with the help of backwardation and contango. The result of the study says that the price discovery mechanism is quite different for different commodities but it suggests that causality can be used in forecasting spot and futures prices. Most of the commodities showed bi-directional causality between spot and future prices. The <b>contango</b> <b>and</b> <b>backwardation</b> helps in identifying the hedging opportunities in the market. The research field taken for the study is Indian Agriculture Commodity Market.

40|$|Recent rapidly {{rising and}} {{volatile}} energy commodities prices and financial price manipulation scandals {{have brought the}} pricing mechanisms of crude oil derivatives to the fore of both popular press and policy initiatives. Among {{the most important of}} such commodities is Brent Crude. Brent Crude and its complex of derivative products make Brent Crude potentially more opaque and thus susceptible to price manipulation than other commodities. In spite of the importance of Brent to the world economy and world energy prices, and its complex of derivative pricing, relatively little work has been done to explore the potential for, and evidence of, price manipulation in the Brent Crude complex. This paper seeks to address this lack by proposing a method to test whether price squeezes have occurred in Brent Crude. This paper builds on previous work which proposed an a priori test for evidence of manipulation and the theory of storage. Previous work (Barrera-Rey and Seymour 1996) posited that the very close-to-delivery end of the forward curve for Brent should not be simultaneously in <b>contango</b> <b>and</b> <b>backwardation,</b> while other work (Geman and Smith 2012) proposed using an econometric prediction and a model based on the theory of storage to detect manipulation in commodity markets. Our work builds on these approaches by developing a more detailed model of calendar spreads in the Brent Crude complex. In Brent, a particular area of potential manipulation is from the relatively illiquid and more opaque physical OTC forward market (where prices are ‘assessed’ by Platts during a short ‘window’ of time) and the more liquid ICE futures market. Our model relates prompt ICE futures calendar spreads to prompt-over-dated OTC forward spreads. The model then tests whether the a priori indicators of manipulation as suggested by Barrera-Rey and Seymour are statistically consistent with the process which drives spreads historically. We find that in most all cases, the indicated period of manipulation is statistically different. We further investigate whether other factors, such as liquidity (volume and open interest) or world oil market conditions (using WTI spreads) or other forward market conditions could be driving our results. The statistical difference is found to be invariant to the inclusion of these other explanatory variables. We conclude that the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of price manipulation and that the test provides a model and method for detecting such cases. ...|$|E

Measuring the idiosyncratic volatility of 27 commodity futures contracts with traditional pricing models that fail to account for <b>backwardation</b> <b>and</b> <b>contango</b> leads to the puzzling finding that idiosyncratic volatility is significantly negatively priced cross-sectionally.

40|$|With {{the growth}} of {{alternative}} investment vehicles such as hedge funds and the resulting search for "new" asset classes, the interest in the commodity market has been growing within the financial sector. The commodity futures markets have been successfully providing a platform for investors and industrial participants as an alternative investment vehicle and a tool for risk management. The storable commodity futures markets are characterised by two distinct market conditions: <b>backwardation</b> <b>and</b> <b>contango,</b> which are directly linked to market fundamentals such as inventory levels and thus influence the price dynamics and functioning of the commodity futures market. While there exists {{a large body of}} {{research in the area of}} commodity derivatives, research on the linkage between market dynamics and the market conditions as determined by fundamentals is very limited. Accordingly, this thesis aims to investigate the different market dynamics of metal futures markets under these two conditions. The issues under examination include the futures price discovery function, the forecasting performance of the futures price, the long-run cost-of-carry equilibrium and short-run time-varying adjustment, and the price volatility and its relationship with inventory levels and trading volume. The empirical findings suggest, for the first time, that the price discovery function depends on the state of the storable commodity markets: futures prices are found to be upward biased predictors of the future spot prices when the market is in <b>contango</b> <b>and</b> are downward biased when the market is in backwardation. Nonparametric bootstrap simulations confirm that the forecast errors are negative in a <b>backwardation</b> market <b>and</b> are positive in a <b>contango</b> market, <b>and</b> moreover the forecast errors are larger under the former market condition than the latter. The empirical results also show that the price volatility is higher in a backwardation market than in a contango market as indicated by the negative relationship between price volatility and inventory levels. We also show that the spot volatility is generally higher than the futures price volatility and the difference is greater when the inventory level is low. Moreover, the impact of trading volume on the futures price volatility is found to be stronger when the market is in backwardation in some of the markets. In short, the empirical findings in this thesis suggest that the functioning of the metal spot and futures market is dependent on market conditions of which the inventory level is an important indictor as implied by the theory of storage. The empirical findings have strong implications for practitioners (particularly, trading houses, funds and banks) who could potentially form different trading strategies based on the distinct market behaviour under the two market conditions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the measurement of}} hedging efficiency. It is argued that conventional measures of the efficiency of risk management operations my be unreliable in commodities where the available hedge represents {{the value of the}} commodity for forward, rather than prompt, delivery. Considerable biases can arise when the time structure of prices is not considered, which tend to lead to overstatement of the efficiency of the hedging vehicle. As an alternative we propose the use of simulations of hedges. The use of simulations not only produces very different results to standard financial formulae, but also demonstrates the sensitivity of the effectiveness of hedging to the time structure of prices. This produces some direct inferences for optimal hedging behaviour. Our simulations consider how effective crude oil futures are for the hedging of various streams of tradeable crude oil. The futures contracts, used alone in a hedging strategy, are shown to perform unpredictably in the hedging of dated Brent, which is the direct price index for some 16 million barrels per day of crude oil trade, and whose influence, particularly in the Far East, is still expanding. We contend that the reason for this poor hedging performance is the non-randomness of the basis risk between futures and prompt crude oil. This basis tends to trend, and we consider hedging effectiveness in three regimes, <b>contangos</b> <b>and</b> both narrowing <b>and</b> widening <b>backwardations.</b> We find that the hedging effectiveness is highly dependent on the time structure regime. Because of the potential size and volatility of the basis, under some conditions using futures as a hedging instrument can produce more risk than unhedged positions. This also has implications for market structure, with the development of informal markets to help hedge the risk that can not be hedged by the use of the futures. The implication of our analysis is that the potential gains are considerable for futures market users who are unable, or unwilling, to access the subsidiary informal markets, should a futures contract whose value more closely proxies that of dated Brent be available...|$|R

Significant momentum profits are identified in both outright futures and spread trading strategies when the spot premium and the term premium are used to form winner and loser portfolios.

Dynamic trading strategies based on contracts with extreme <b>backwardation,</b> extreme <b>contango,</b> <b>and</b> extreme hedging pressures are also tested.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the hypothesis of}} Tilton et al.

It is further observed that: First, investor demand on the futures market is highly correlated with spot and futures prices during backwardation, but lesser during weak <b>contango,</b> <b>and</b> the least correlated during strong contango. Second, the efficiency of the futures market is related to the degree of correlation between spot and futures price changes.

Therefore, we extend the hypothesis that the preference of holding a long position in the futures market is due to the anticipation of insufficient supply of CPO which happens during the backwardation period...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Given {{the current}} turmoil in {{financial}} markets, {{the search for}} alternative assets to diversify away from traditional equity portfolios is stronger than ever. Inspired by the diversification potential of commodities and the recent bull-run in commodity prices, the interest in commodity indexes and structured products has revived. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the relative merits of passive commodity investments. We evaluate the individual performance of commodities relative to traditional choices of asset allocation. Even though commodities generate equity-like returns, their substantial volatility and downside risk indicate that they do not present a good stand-alone investment. Nonetheless, we show that passive commodity investments are excellent vehicles for portfolio diversification. Using the Fama & Schwert (1977) model, we further demonstrate that commodities are able to (partially) hedge unexpected inflation.

40|$|We {{construct}} a general multi-factor model for estimation and calibration of commodity spot prices and futures valuation. This extends the multi-factor long-short model in Schwartz and Smith (Manag Sci 893 - 911, 2000) and Yan (Review of Derivatives Research 5 (3) : 251 - 271, 2002) in two important aspects: firstly we allow {{for both the}} long and short term dynamic factors to be mean reverting incorporating stochastic volatility factors and secondly we develop an additive structural seasonality model. In developing this non-linear continuous time stochastic model we maintain desirable model properties such as being arbitrage free and exponentially affine, thereby allowing us to derive closed form futures prices. In addition the models provide an improved capability to capture dynamics of the futures curve calibration in different commodities market conditions such as <b>backwardation</b> <b>and</b> <b>contango.</b> A Milstein scheme is used to provide an accurate discretized representation of the s. d. e. model. This results in a challenging non-linear non-Gaussian state-space model. To carry out inference, we develop an adaptive particle Markov chain Monte Carlo method. This methodology allows us to jointly calibrate and filter the latent processes for the long-short and volatility dynamics. This methodology is general and {{can be applied to}} the estimation and calibration of many of the other multi-factor stochastic commodity models proposed in the literature.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyze the {{diversification}} effect brought by crude oil Futures contracts, the most liquid commodity Futures, into a portfolio of stocks. The studies that have documented the very low- and essentially negative-correlations between commodities and equities typically rely on normally distributed returns, {{which is not the}} case for crude oil Futures and stocks indexes. Moreover, the particular time-to-maturity chosen for the Future contract used as an investment vehicle is an important matter that needs to be addressed, in presence of forward curves switching between <b>backwardation</b> <b>and</b> <b>contango</b> shapes. Our goal in this paper is twofold: (a) we introduce copula functions to have a better representation of the dependence structure of oil Futures with equity indexes; (b) using this copula representation, we are able to analyze in a precise manner the "maturity effect" in the choice of crude oil Future contract with respect to its diversification benefits. Our finding is that, in the case of distant maturities Futures, e. g., 18 months, the negative correlation effect is more pronounced whether stock prices increase or decrease. This property has the merit to avoid the hurdles of a frequent roll over while being quite desirable in the current trendless equity markets.

40|$|The {{existence}} of backwardation has attracted considerable attention in commodity markets {{because of the}} negative carrying cost puzzle. This dissertation estimates the causes of backwardation of stochastic prices in grain markets. The research extends existing research by considering local market responses and uncertainty. ^ The Beta coefficient from the single index model {{is defined as the}} measure of risk averse preference for the farmer at a specific location. With the flexible least squares technique, the time-varying beta estimators can reveal the up-to-date price risk change for a site. The uncertainty associated with space and time was examined with the real option pricing evaluation (ROPE) approach, which can calculate the present value for an irreversible store/sell decision option that a farmer faces under uncertainty. ^ To consider the possible stochastic demand and the specific decision behavior for local site, a multi-demand-multi-supply (MDMS) model is developed in this study. Development of MDMS model also contributes to solve the possible aggregation problems by analyzing local data. Price spread between deferred futures price and spot price is defined as the dependent variable. Storage level, transaction costs, risk preference index, option value, demand shock dummy, and a set of four quarterly dummies are considered in the regression equation for corn. Forty observations from the first quarter of 1988 to the fourth quarter of 1997 in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Ohio are selected for the corn industry. The wheat market was examined for the same states except Iowa. ^ The empirical outcomes for corn are consistent with the results in previous models. Based on the statistical evidences, transaction costs, uncertainty, seasonality, and external impact are all statistically significant. Very little support for the role of risk aversion was found. Positive coefficients for the first three terms imply that they will expand the size of backwardation if their values increase. This confirms the two major goals for this research. First, the option value can describe the degree of uncertainty well. Second, uncertainty concern significantly influences the size of the price spread <b>and</b> <b>backwardation</b> as well. However, the statistical results are not satisfactory for wheat industry. ...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{markets have}} become {{increasingly}} sophisticated, requiring modelling techniques of analogous calibre. This thesis deals with models of changing regime for the petroleum complex. Modelling the conditional distribution of energy prices as a regime switching process is motivated by the market-specific characteristics of oil: different market conditions, such as <b>backwardation</b> <b>and</b> <b>contango,</b> involve different dynamics. The first empirical part examines the very short-end of the futures curve volatility. To address in a realistic way the potential diverse response of oil volatility to fundamentals across high and low volatility regimes, augmented regime volatility models are employed. Results indicate that volatility can be decomposed to a highly persistent conditional volatility process and a relatively short-lived non-stationary process. Apart from evaluating the size of price risk, risk managers must also design a framework for mitigating their exposures. This {{is the focus of}} the second empirical part which estimates dynamic hedge ratios. Linking the concept of disequilibrium with that of uncertainty across high and low volatility regimes, a state-dependent error correction model with timevarying second moments is introduced. Finally, the third empirical part, examines the information content of the dependence structure between correlated petroleum futures curves. Term structure is decomposed into level, slope and curvature shocks. Introducing a multiregime framework, these factors are utilised to study inter-commodity and inter-market spreads. Results suggest markedly different state-dependent speeds of mean reversion and volatility/correlation dynamics across regimes. Overall, the employed models provide superior forecasting performance and indicate that state-dependent dynamics may provide significant benefits to market participants. The findings of this thesis have important implications for energy market trading and risk management, as well as energy market operations, such as refining and budget planning, by providing valuable information on the oil price volatility dynamics and the ability to predict risk.
