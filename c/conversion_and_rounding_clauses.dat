50|$|The move {{to smaller}} units (e.g. {{millilitre}} vs fluid ounce, gram vs ounce) allows manufacturers to move sizes of packaging {{up and down}} with more precision using whole numbers. For example, a 2-ounce bag of chips may be altered to 50 grams, then to 45 grams. Likewise, a variety of packaging sizes may arise, such as 690 grams (about 24 oz) or 1200 grams (about 42 oz), resulting from <b>conversion</b> <b>and</b> <b>rounding</b> of customary units. However, the precise adjustment of packaging sizes is also possible using customary units, e.g. the 2-ounce bag can be downsized to 1.8 and 1.6 ounces as well.|$|R

50|$|BCD {{was used}} in many early decimal computers, and is {{implemented}} in the instruction set of machines such as the IBM System/360 series and its descendants, Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX and the Motorola 68000-series processors. Although BCD per se is not as widely used {{as in the past}} and is no longer implemented in newer computers' instruction sets (such as ARM; x86 does not support BCD instructions in long mode any more) decimal fixed-point and floating-point formats are still important and continue to be used in financial, commercial, and industrial computing, where subtle <b>conversion</b> <b>and</b> fractional <b>rounding</b> errors that are inherent in floating point binary representations cannot be tolerated.|$|R
40|$|Inferno is an {{operating}} system {{well suited to}} applications {{that need to be}} portable, graphical, and networked. This paper describes the fundamental floating point facilities of the system, including: tight rules on expression evaluation, binary/decimal <b>conversion,</b> exceptions <b>and</b> <b>rounding,</b> <b>and</b> the elementary function library. Although the focus of Inferno is interactive media, its portability across hardware and operating platforms, its relative simplicity, and its strength in distributed computing make it attractive for advanced scientific computing as well. Since the appearance of a new operating system is a relatively uncommon event, this is a special opportunity for numerical analysts to voice their opinion about what fundamental facilities they need. The purpose of this short paper is to describe numerical aspects of the initial release of Inferno, and to invite comment before the tyranny of backward compatibility makes changes impossible.

40|$|Features {{are central}} to all major {{theories}} of syntax and morphology. Yet {{it can be a}} non-trivial task to determine the inventory of features and their values for a given language, and in particular to determine whether to postulate one feature or two in the same semantico-syntactic domain. We illustrate this from tense-aspect-mood (TAM) in Kayardild, and adduce principles for deciding in general between one-feature and two-feature analyses, thereby contributing to the theory of feature systems and their typology. Kayardild shows striking inflectional complexities, investigated in two major studies (Evans 1995 a; <b>Round</b> 2013), <b>and</b> it proves particularly revealing for our topic. Both Evans <b>and</b> <b>Round</b> claimed that <b>clauses</b> in Kayardild have not one but two concurrent TAM features. While it is perfectly possible for a language to have two features of the same type, it is unusual. Accordingly, we establish general arguments which would justify postulating two features rather than one; we then apply these specifically to Kayardild TAM. Our finding is at variance with both Evans and Round; on all counts, the evidence which would motivate an analysis in terms of one TAM feature or two is either approximately balanced, or clearly favours an analysis with just one. Thus even when faced with highly complex language facts, we can apply a principled approach {{to the question of whether}} we are dealing with one feature or two, and this is encouraging for the many of us seeking a rigorous science of typology. We also find that Kayardild, which in many ways is excitingly exotic, is in this one corner of its grammar quite ordinary...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} the study of feed quality and its effect on the performance of the fluid catalytic cracking unit using Port-Harcourt Refinery Company (PHRC) as a case study. The important feed qualities used are the hydrocarbon content and a hydrotreated feed. Data on the feed properties used in PHRC were collected and a product mass balance was carried out on the fluid catalytic cracking unit. <b>Conversion</b> <b>and</b> gasoline yield of the unit were found to be 73. 43 vol % and 52. 07 vol % respectively. On comparison with cracking of aromatic feed, from literature, with 61. 3 vol % <b>conversion</b> <b>and</b> 45. 64 vol % gasoline yields, the feed is said to be paraffinic because of its higher <b>conversion</b> <b>and</b> gasoline yield. On comparison with that collected for hydrotreated feed, 80. 62 vol % <b>conversion</b> <b>and</b> 63. 9 vol % gasoline yield, it is concluded that feed hydrotreating increases <b>conversion</b> <b>and</b> gasoline yield by a significant amount...|$|R
