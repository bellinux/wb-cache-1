The test parameter was an embedded length. The paper first presents test results, and shows methods to evaluate strength and stiffness. The strength was evaluated, considering three kinds of resisting action; anchor bolt-base plate action, prying action of the embedded portion of the CFT column, and tension of vertical reinforcing bars in the foundation. The stiffness was evaluated, considering the deformations of anchor bolts, base plate, and concrete compressed by the base plate and the <b>column</b> <b>tube.</b> It is show that the maximum strength and the initial stiffness of each specimen were fairly well estimated by the proposed evaluation method...|$|E

It is supposed that the well trajectories can have geometrical imperfections {{in the shape of}} cylindrical spiral or plane cosinusoidal curves. The system of ordinary differential equations is derived {{on the basis of the}} theory of curvilinear flexible elastic rods. It permits one to describe static effects of the drill column bending accompanying the processes of its raising, lowering and rotating inside the bore-hole. Through the use of this system the direct and inverse problems of the drill column deforming are formulated for calculation of internal and external resistance forces acting on the drill <b>column</b> <b>tube.</b> The methods for numerical solution of the constructed equations are elaborated.

In this paper, the compressive tests on this joint were carried out after the cyclic reversed loading. First the cyclic loading experiment results were introduced briefly, then the compressive tests were presented. The bearing capacity, crack patterns, deformation, strain of the reinforcements of the specimens were studied. These specimens were also compared with the other specimens only under compressive test. The results show that the specimens have good ductility. The concrete of the reinforced concrete (RC) ring beam cracked before the yield of the steel ring bars or the buckling of the steel tube. Although the cyclic loading caused some damage on the ring beam, it had few effects on the axial bearing capacity. The RC ring beam can still confine the joint zone and ensure the capacity of the joint zone was not lower than the CFST column...|$|E

In {{order to}} study the {{mechanical}} behavior of the joint between concrete filled steel tubular column and beam with discontinuous <b>column</b> <b>tube</b> at the joint zone under axial pressure, the finite element analysis software ANSYS is adopted for parametric analysis and the analysis results are compared with experimental ones. The principal compressive stress is mainly transmitted by the inside area of the joint which is subjected to local compression if it is low, but extends to more outside areas of the joint if it is high. The radial compressive stress, which is the confined stress of the ring beam to the core concrete of the joint, keeps {{the same as that}} the width of the ring beam equal to the diameter of the core area of the joint.

A gel containing positively charged ligands was synthesized from derivatized acrylamide monomers.

The separation was suppressed by the glucose-transport inhibitor cytochalasin B. The interactions between d-glucose, the transport inhibitor forskolin and Glut 1 were analyzed by quantitative frontal affinity chromatography. The dissociation constants at room temperature were 6. 8 mM for d-glucose binding and 1. 8 μM for glucose-displaceable binding of forskolin, in good agreement with published values.

The combination of RPC and steel tube will compensate the brittleness of RPC and enhance the stability of steel tube, and the loading capacity of the RPC filled steel tube will be improved. Five RPC filled steel <b>tube</b> <b>columns</b> are designed and tested to obtain the ultimate load bearing capacity, the deformation and the strain information. During the loading process, the concrete and the steel tube of the RPC filled steel <b>tube</b> <b>columns</b> are loaded simultaneously. The loading results show that the deformation of the RPC filled steel <b>tube</b> <b>columns</b> are mainly in elastic phase before the loading capacity is up to the ultimate value. The test load decreases to be 80 %~ 90 % of the ultimate loading value and then it changes to be smooth. The failure mode of the RPC filled steel <b>tube</b> <b>columns</b> is ductile. The test loading capacity is compared with the formula from the reference.

The fire resistance of this composite column was investigated experimentally. One circular steel <b>tube</b> <b>column</b> filled with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete and one circular steel <b>tube</b> <b>column</b> filled with high- strength concrete were tested under axial load and fire. The test results show that the axial deformations of both kinds of the composite columns under the same load level have experienced three stages variation:the initial expansion deformation stage,the compression deformation gradual growth stage and the damage stage with the dramatic increasing in compression deformation. The second compression stable development stage of the circular steel tube filled with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete is much longer than that of the circular steel <b>tube</b> <b>column</b> filled with high-strength concrete. Thus the fire endurance of the circular steel tube filled with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete reaches 166 minutes while the fire endurance of the circular steel <b>tube</b> <b>column</b> filled with high-strength concrete only reaches 46 minutes.
