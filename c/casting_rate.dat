However, little attention has been given to the possibility of accelerating the slow <b>casting</b> <b>rate</b> obtained with dispersed or coagulated advanced ceramic slips by the use of heating the slip. This paper investigates the effect of elevated temperature on the rheological properties and casting rates of four slips: one dispersed electrostatically, one dispersed electrosterically and two which are based on electrostatic dispersion followed by the addition of direrent salt levels to achieve coagulated slips. It is observed that the use of elevated temperatures results in increases in the casting rates in all cases, however the coagulated slips behave dofferently to dispersed slips. The latter display casting rates which increase linearly with increasing temperature whilst coagulated slips display an initial rapid increase after which the <b>casting</b> <b>rate</b> decreases signtcantly. This is believed to be due to the interaction between the permeability of the green body and the state of dispersion of the slip. A further observation arising from the work is that there is generally an enhanced <b>casting</b> <b>rate</b> when microwave energy is used to heat the slips compared to that achieved with a convection oven. The mechanism of acceleration is believed to be due to the rate of water movement through the cast being increased more than the rate of water uptake by the cast...|$|E

Perfect texturing/orientation of BNNTs within the melt-spun ribbons is difficult to achieve, and the tubes are mostly randomly oriented within the ribbons, having only a sort of quasi-alignment along the casting direction. Viscosity of the melt can be controlled by its overheating; this may result in better nanotube orientation under casting, but the overheating can lead to the negative phenomenon of BNNTs floating to the upper molten zone and inhomogeneous tube distribution in the ribbons after casting.|$|E

A questionnaire survey, completed by 297 golf clubs, {{was used to assess}} the severity of casting, along with cultural and chemical methods of control, at a time four years after the withdrawal of chlordane when the residual effects of this material have begun to diminish. Problems of casting were reported to be greater on tees and fairways than on greens, with 42 % of tees and 49 % of fairways being reported to have moderate or severe problems of casting. Nearly two-thirds of respondents suggested that <b>rates</b> of <b>casting</b> had increased compared with the period before December 1992 when chlordane was available and 22 % of responses suggested that casting was now a much greater problem. <b>Casting</b> <b>rates</b> were higher on parkland courses and courses converted from agricultural land than on links or moorland areas.

5000|$|Pressure casting: Specially {{developed}} {{polymeric materials}} allow a mould {{to be subject}} to application external pressures of up to 4.0 MPa-so much higher than slip casting in plaster moulds where the capillary forces correspond to a pressure of around 0.1 - 0.2 MPa. The high pressure leads to much faster <b>casting</b> <b>rates</b> and, hence, faster production cycles. Furthermore, the application of high pressure air through the polymeric moulds upon demoulding the cast means a new casting cycle can be started immediately in the same mould, unlike plaster moulds which require lengthy drying times. The polymeric materials have much greater durability than plaster and, therefore, it is possible to achieve shaped products with better dimensional tolerances and much longer mould life.

50|$|Starting a {{continuous}} casting machine involves placing a dummy bar (essentially a curved metal beam) up through the spray chamber to close off {{the base of the}} mould. Metal is poured into the mould and withdrawn with the dummy bar once it solidifies. It is extremely important that the metal supply afterwards be guaranteed to avoid unnecessary shutdowns and restarts, known as 'turnarounds'. Each time the caster stops and restarts, a new tundish is required, as any uncast metal in the tundish cannot be drained and instead freezes into a 'skull'. Avoiding turnarounds requires the meltshop, including ladle furnaces (if any) to keep tight control on the temperature of the metal, which can vary dramatically with alloying additions, slag cover and deslagging, and the preheating of the ladle before it accepts metal, among other parameters. However, the <b>cast</b> <b>rate</b> may be lowered by reducing the amount of metal in the tundish (although this can increase wear on the tundish), or if the caster has multiple strands, one or more strands may be shut down to accommodate upstream delays. Turnarounds may be scheduled into a production sequence if the tundish temperature becomes too high after a certain number of heats or the service lifetime of a non-replaceable component (i.e., the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) in a thin-slab casting machine) is reached.|$|R
