In {{the last few}} years, there is increased use of the extrusion process for production of food products. This process is, besides other things, used for obtaining directly expanded products, which are immediately packed and sent on market after mechanical and thermal treatment in extruder, or after drying for a short time. One of these food products is “snack” food. Snack food is made with twin corotating screw extruders, in which raw materials are submitted to high temperatures and short time, with intensive expansion and rapid pressure drop. For the production of this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> products, basic ingredients like corn, wheat, rye and rice, with the maximum of 9 % of proteins, are used.

40|$|Background: Food {{consumption}} {{is a major}} factor to fulfill the nutritional needs of a person. Food {{consumption is}} influenced by several factors, such as the level of income, food availability, public awareness toward nutrition, and socio-cultural factors. Riau Province is one of the provinces that the food consumption is still relatively low and Kampar Regency occupies a very high position in the food insecurity index and hunger vulnerability index. There is 49. 21 % of the population that could potentially be food shortages. This is supported by the occurrence of nutritional problems in communities associated with the availability of food, low purchasing power and the inability to gain access to nutritious food. Objective: To identify the patterns of food consumption and family food security in Kampar regency in Riau province. Method: The study was an observational research with cross sectional design. Samples are a family in Kampar regency as many as 105 families selected by using cluster sampling conducted in August-September 2015. Statistical analysis was performed by chi-square test and logistic regression. Results: The statistical analysis shows that the majority of respondents had food consumption patterns with the category of unfulfilled as 64. 77 % and for the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> security as 60. 96 % was in the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> insecure. The results of chi-square statistical test showed that there was a significant correlation between food consumption patterns to family food security in Kampar regency Riau Province (p 0, 000). The results of the bivariate analysis it is known that there was a significant correlation between the variables of the number of family member, food access, food expenses, energy consumption and protein consumption to the level of family food security in Kampar regency of Riau province indicated by a value of p < 0. 05. Conclusion: There is a significant correlation between the patterns of food consumption toward family food security in Kampar regency Riau province.
