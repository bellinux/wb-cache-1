5000|$|Bubble {{pressure}} method {{is commonly used}} to measure the dynamic surface tension for the system containing surfactants or other impurities because it does not require <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> <b>measurement</b> and has high accuracy even though the measurement is done rapidly. [...] “Bubble {{pressure method}}” can be applied to measure the dynamic surface tension, particularly for the systems which contain surfactants. [...] Moreover, this method is an appropriate technique to apply to biological fluids like serum because it does not require a large amount of liquid sample for the measurements.|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} way of measuring {{the contact angle}} of a sessile drop is with a contact angle goniometer, which allows the user to measure the contact angle visually. A droplet is deposited by a syringe which is positioned above the sample surface, and a high resolution camera captures the image from the profile or side view. The image can then be analyzed either by eye (with a protractor) or more often is measured using image analysis software. This type of measurement {{is referred to as}} a static <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to that method, {{it is also possible}} to simply do tests using liquids with no polar component to their surface energies, and then liquids that do have both polar and dispersive components, and then linearize the equations (see table 1). First, one performs the standard sessile drop <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> <b>measurement</b> for the solid in question and a liquid with a polar components of zero (=0; [...] =) The second step is to use a second probe liquid that has both a dispersive and a polar component to its surface energy, and then solve for the unknowns algebraically. The Fowkes theory generally requires the use of only two probe liquids, as described above, and the recommended ones are diiodomethane, which should have no polar component due to its molecular symmetry, and water, which is commonly known to be a very polar liquid.|$|E

30|$|The {{wettability}} of the MDF specimens {{was measured}} by the <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> method known as goniometer method. <b>Contact</b> <b>angle</b> <b>measurements</b> were performed using a CAM 101 optical <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> meter (KSV Instruments Ltd., Helsinki, Finland), equipped with a video camera, which collected one image per second. Using the sessile drop method, which is the most widely used procedure, the <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> was determined simply by aligning tangent with the sessile drop profile at the point of contact with the solid surface. An imaging system was used to measure <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> and droplet shape for the tested surfaces of the samples.

The surface energy of polycarbonate was found to increase (60 percent) during UV/O 3 treatment. However, calculations on PMMA were hampered by the formation of a water soluble surface product. On PTFE surfaces, the UV/O 3 treatment etched the surface causing large increases in surface roughness, rendering <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> <b>measurements</b> impossible.
