40|$|In the {{previous}} {{paper on the}} Ag+-HPLC of conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) on a silica-based stationary phase, we examined the relative retentions of the CLAs, their methyl esters (<b>CLAMEs),</b> and stearic acid. The retention of the CLAs far exceeds {{the sum of the}} retention of the <b>CLAMEs</b> and stearic acid. In this paper we isolate the interactions at the silica surface by determining the retentions of the same compounds on the NH 4 + cation exchanger that is the precursor to the Ag+ column in the manufacturing process. On the NH 4 + column, the <b>CLAMEs</b> are very weakly retained, but the sum of the retentions of the <b>CLAMEs</b> plus stearic acid is equal to that of the CLAs. It was determined that stearic acid is retained to the same degree on both the NH 4 + and Ag+ stationary phases. By implication, the CLA carboxylic acid functionality does not interact with Ag+ and thus three-centre complexes of the Ag+ with the CLA bonds and carboxyl group do not occur. (Independent supporting evidence is also presented.) A model for CLA retention on the Ag+ stationary phase that explains the synergy of retention is presented. It involves a random arrangement of collapsed Ag+ alkyl sulphonate bonded phase on the silica surface. The nature of retention on the NH 4 + stationary phase is also discussed. Partial separation of the CLAs on the NH 4 + stationary phase shows that bond interactions with the silica surface also contribute to the separations of the CLAs, the <b>CLAMEs,</b> and other unsaturated analytes. As was found on the Ag+ column in the absence acetonitrile, normal phase elution occurs and log k versus log (% strong solvent) plots for all analytes are linear on the NH 4 + column. (Where the specific displacement mechanism of unsaturates from the Ag+ by ACN was present, the log-linear plots were straight lines) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{projected}} diode assisted Neutral Point Diode <b>Clamed</b> (NPC-MLI) {{with the}} photovoltaic system produces a maximum voltage gain that is comparatively {{higher than those}} of other boost conversion techniques. This paper mainly explores vector selection approach pulse-width modulation (PWM) strategies for diode-assisted NPC-MLI to obtain a maximum voltage gain without compromising in waveform quality. To obtain a high voltage gain maximum utilization of dc-link voltage and stress on the power switches must be reduced. From the above issues in the diode assisted NPC-MLI leads to vector selection approach PWM technique to perform capacitive charging in parallel and discharging in series to obtain maximum voltage gain. The operation principle and the relationship of voltage gain versus voltage boost duty ratio and switching device voltage stress versus voltage gain are theoretically investigated in detail. Owing to better performance, diode-assisted NPC-MLI is more promising and competitive topology for wide range DC/AC power conversion in a renewable anergy application.

Even if the phenomenon is quite weak on the Walloon tourist market, it is important {{from the point of}} view of farmers for who agritourism is a mean of supplementary incomes. Based on crossed informations and data coming from surveys of potential tourists carried out in tourist poles, life-histories of local tenants and interviews of privileged witnesses as well as content analysis of promotional folders and websites, the position of agritourism on the Walloon tourist market is analysed. It is showed firstly that agritourism is a niche market, which risk dissociating itself from the first pathway if the links between the farm and the tourism continue to weaken. Most of the time agritourism is complementary to other tourist offers but it can also compete with some other forms of tourism in particular cases. Furthermore the demand influences agritourism development through different images and representations that may go off the agricultural practices than with which farmers need to adapt their activities. Finally, different diversifications are developed according to geographic settings. Peer reviewe...|$|E
