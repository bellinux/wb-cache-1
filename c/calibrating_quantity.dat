40|$|The phase {{response}} of a transducer {{acting as a}} transmitter or receiver of sound is important in many industrial applications, such as fiscal measurements of natural gas, therein multipath ultrasonic transit-time flow meters, measurements on the velocity of sound in the gas, as well as quality measurements on natural gas. A recurring challenge when attempting to measure the {{phase response}} of transducers acoustically are the estimates of both the separation distance between the transmitter and receiver {{as well as the}} speed of sound in the media. Small deviations in both are associated with large deviations in the measured phase. For example, at 100 kHz given a sound speed in air of 343 m/s, a deviation of only ± 1 mm in the measured distance between the transmitter and receiver gives a phase deviation of ± 105 º, and for 300 kHz the phase deviation is ± 315 º. In the current work, laser sensors are employed to determine the separation distance between the transmitter and receiver. The uncertainty associated with the distance measurement is estimated to be 40 µm. Utilizing the lasers, piezoelectric disks operating in air are calibrated using the reciprocity method for both magnitude and phase. The <b>calibrated</b> <b>quantities</b> are the transmitting voltage response and the receiving voltage sensitivity, and the frequency range of primary interest is 70 - 125 kHz, where a SNR larger than 40 dB is expected. The <b>calibrated</b> <b>quantities</b> are compared to FE-simulations, and around 90 - 105 kHz the deviations between the simulated and measured phases are less then 15 º for the receiving voltage sensitivity, and approximately 6. 5 º for the transmitting voltage response. 8 measurements on the repeatability of the measurement set-up have been performed and the standard deviation about the mean is calculated to 2 º for the same frequency range. The measurement uncertainties are developed for magnitude and indicates an uncertainty of approximately 0. 3 dB. This is comparable to the uncertainties provided by commercial transducer producers, such as Brüel & Kjær...|$|R

40|$|Interface {{delamination}} {{is reported}} to be the dominant mode of failure in the stepped lap joints in CFRP composites. The load transfer between the patch and panel takes place through thin adhesive layer. And it being weak link makes it prone to damages. However, not much work was reported in literature to understand the complex mixed-mode delamination of adhesive layer in CFRP laminates. Our study aims at modelling mixed-mode delamination under quasi-static loading conditions for single and double stepped lap unidirectional CFRP composite joint. Modified Cohesive mode- 1 Crack and Mixed mode cohesive zone modelling developed by Benzeggagh and Kanane (1995) are used to model the ductile adhesive failure. The mode- 1 and 2 fracture toughness required for Beneggagh-Kanane model are obtained through standard experiments. We calibrated the numerical DCB under opening mode loading with the cohesive crack (in method- 1) and the mixed mode delamination (method- 2) to obtain the cohesive crack length and mixed mode parameter. Through the calibration we showed that the mixed-mode delmaination modelling can be either modelled using the modified cohesive crack or Benzeggagh-Kanane model. The <b>calibrated</b> <b>quantities</b> is used in understnading the single and double stepped lap joint. Modified cohesive crack is superior of Benzeggagh-Kanane model in estimating the damage intiation load and ultimate failure load...|$|R

40|$|Storing, transmitting, and {{manipulating}} information {{using the}} electron spin resides {{at the heart}} of spintronics. Fundamental for future spintronics applications is the ability to control spin currents in solid state systems. Among the different platforms proposed so far, semiconductors with strong spin-orbit interaction are especially attractive as they promise fast and scalable spin control with all-electrical protocols. Here we demonstrate both the generation and measurement of pure spin currents in semiconductor nanostructures. Generation is purely electrical and mediated by the spin dynamics in materials with a strong spin-orbit field. Measurement is accomplished using a spin-to-charge conversion technique, based on the magnetic field symmetry of easily measurable electrical <b>quantities.</b> <b>Calibrating</b> the spin-to-charge conversion via the conductance of a quantum point contact, we quantitatively measure the mesoscopic spin Hall effect in a multiterminal GaAs dot.

40|$|Abstract. This chapter {{reviews the}} way in which 3 D plant and canopy models have been used in the field of remote sensing. The focus of the chapter is on remote sensing of crops at {{microwave}} and optical wavelengths, although other applications are discussed. A brief review of remote sensing of crops is presented, followed by an evaluation of the motivation for using various types of 3 D models with remotesensing data. A discussion of current issues and areas requiring future work is provided. REMOTE SENSING OF CROPS Crop monitoring using earth observation (EO) is of major importance for its potential economic value to farm managers, levying or subsidizing bodies, and commodities and futures markets. It is also of value because of the role crops and cropping practices play in wider scientific and societal issues such as the environmental impact of farm-chemical inputs and carbon sequestration (Schlesinger 1999; Robertson et al. 2000). In addition, crops serve as a useful, controlled environment in which to develop generic EO science of wider application. The key capability of remote sensing in this context is to provide regular sets of spatial observations of radiometric properties of earth surface vegetation. EO instruments can be deployed in support of crop monitoring in a variety of ways, including in-field sensors, airborne systems and satellites, obtaining information at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Deriving estimates of state and rate variables of vegetation canopies has long been a goal of remote-sensing science. Traditionally, this has been attempted on the basis of empirical relationships between remote observations and (measured or modelled) biophysical parameters. For radar applications, relationships are usually derived by <b>calibrating</b> observed <b>quantities</b> (leaf area index (LAI), biomass etc.) with backscatter. For optical measurements, similar quantities are often related to vegetation indices, in a...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{goal is to}} better understand mixing processes in estuaries. Of particular interest are the processes {{at work in the}} Haro Strait region between Washington State and British Columbia, which are modulated by a spring/neap cycle in tidal velocities. OBJECTIVES The field phase of the Haro Strait experiment took place in the summer of 1996 and involved a collaborative effort between MIT, WHOI and IOS. Our objectives are to understand the dynamics associated with intense coastal mixing processes in which separation of tidal flows past topography leads to formation of fronts accompanied by instability and mixing. During this year, we have begun to analyze this data in two different areas. First, we wanted to better quantify the large-scale dynamics. This means estimating horizontal layer transports, rates and amounts of mixing that take place. Second, we want to use these results to understand the importance of smaller-scale mixing that occurs at convergence fronts within this region. APPROACH The first task after the cruise was to organize and <b>calibrate</b> the large <b>quantities</b> of acoustic and hydrographic data collected by the IOS group.

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] custom radiation monitoring system was developed by Oregon State University {{at the request of the}} Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute to measure radioactive cesium contaminants in the ocean waters near Fukushima Dai’ichi Nuclear Power Plant. The system was to be used on board the R/V Ka’imikai-O-Kanaloa during a 15 d research cruise to provide real-time approximations of radionuclide concentration and alert researchers to the possible occurrence of highly elevated radionuclide concentrations. A NaI(Tl) scintillation detector was coupled to a custom-built compact digital spectroscopy system and suspended within a sealed tank of continuously flowing seawater. A series of counts were acquired within an energy region corresponding to the main photopeak of ¹³⁷Cs. The system was <b>calibrated</b> using known <b>quantities</b> of radioactive ¹³⁴Cs and ¹³⁷Cs in a ratio equating to that present at the reactors’ ocean outlet. The response between net count rate and concentration of ¹³⁷Cs was then used to generate temporal and geographic plots of ¹³⁷Cs concentration throughout the research cruise in Japanese coastal waters. The concentration of ¹³⁷Cs was low but detectable, reaching a peak of 3. 8 ± 0. 2 Bq/L...|$|R
40|$|Determination of {{circulating}} blood volume was undertaken {{as a part}} of a study of the disturbed physiology in pellagra, chiefly for the purpose of finding out whether shrinkage of plasma volume existed in patients who were suffering from a disease frequently characterized by severe diarrhea. Such a shrinkage would be of great importance of itself, and would obviously have a bearing upon the interpretation of the composition of the plasma determined at the same time. The existence of anemia can hardly be established nor its severity estimated-so long as we are in ignorance- of the plasma volume. It was also considered possible that the magnitude of the {{circulating blood}} volume might be correlated with certain of the features of the skin lesions, such as the degree of exudation of serum. I have used the dye method of Keith, Rowntree and Geraghty (1) modified as follows: A 3 per cent aqueous solution of brilliant vital red (National Analine Company) was made up 'the afternoon before use, and sterilized at 100 °C. for 8 minutes. With a sterile <b>calibrated</b> pipette the <b>quantity</b> of this solution for each patient was placed in a sterile 50 cc. flask. The volume used for- each patient was approxi-mately 1 cc. for each 15 kilos of body weight. At the bedside, the dye was drawn from the flask through a sterile needle, which was then discarded, into a sterile Luer syringe which had just been rinsed with sterile distilled water. The dye left in the flask was taken up in a small quantity of sterile distilled water. After taking blood for chemical studies and to provide plasma for preparation of dye stand-ard, the dye was injected through the same needle and the remaining dye washed out of the syringe with the patient's circulating blood by emptying and filling the syringe twice.
