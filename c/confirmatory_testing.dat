5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes <b>confirmatory</b> <b>testing</b> with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E

Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has been the principal target for laboratory testing to identify active infection by HBV. We aimed to find out diagnostic validity of the Liaison chemiluminescent method compared to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for HBV detection in the routine clinical diagnostic laboratory. Materials and Methods: From 350 patients suspicious of having infection with HBV, serum samples were separated and used for testing HBsAg by two methods of Liaison chemiluminescent immunoassay, with HBsAg <b>confirmatory</b> <b>test</b> and PCR method. Results: According to the PCR results as assumed as gold standard method with 100 % sensitivity and specificity, detection rate sensitivity of chemiluminescent with <b>confirmatory</b> <b>test</b> was 96 % and its specificity was 100 %, and for chemiluminescent without <b>confirmatory</b> <b>test</b> sensitivity and specificity were 100 % and 70 %, respectively.

The modified CLSI ESBL <b>confirmatory</b> <b>test</b> was performed with cefotaxime and ceftazidime disks with and without clavulanate, on which both boronic acid (BA) and EDTAwere dispensed. A total of 162 genotypically confirmed ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae isolates (83 carbapenemase/ESBL producers, 25 AmpC/ ESBL producers, and 54 ESBL-only producers) were examined. For comparison, 139 genotypically confirmed ESBL-negative En-terobacteriaceae isolates (94 of them possessed carbapenemases and 20 possessed AmpCs) were also tested. The standard CLSI ESBL <b>confirmatory</b> <b>test</b> was positive for 106 of the 162 ESBL producers (sensitivity, 65. 4 %) and showed false-positive results for 4 of the 139 non-ESBL producers (specificity, 97. 1 %).

40|$|Background Data on {{the cost}} {{effectiveness}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and vaccination strategies for prevention of vertical transmission of HBV in resource limited settings is sparse. Methods A decision tree model of HBV prevention strategies utilised data from a cohort of 7071 pregnant women on the Thailand-Myanmar border using a provider perspective. All options included universal HBV vaccination for newborns in three strategies: (1) universal vaccination alone; (2) universal vaccination with screening of women during antenatal visits with rapid diagnostic test (RDT) plus HBV immune globulin (HBIG) administration to newborns of HBV surface antigen positive women; and (3) universal vaccination with screening of women during antenatal visits plus HBIG administration to newborns of women testing HBV e antigen positive by <b>confirmatory</b> <b>test.</b> At {{the time of the}} study, the HBIG after <b>confirmatory</b> <b>test</b> strategy was used. The costs in United States Dollars (US$), infections averted and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and sensitivity analyses were conducted. A willingness to pay threshold of US$ 1200 was used. Results The universal HBV vaccination was the least costly option at US$ 4. 33 per woman attending the clinic. The HBIG after (RDT) strategy had an ICER of US$ 716. 78 per infection averted. The HBIG after <b>confirmatory</b> <b>test</b> strategy was not cost-effective due to extended dominance. The one-way sensitivity analysis showed that while the transmission parameters and cost of HBIG had the biggest impact on outcomes, the HBIG after <b>confirmatory</b> <b>test</b> only became a cost-effective option when a low test cost was used or a high HBIG cost was used. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that HBIG after RDT had an 87 % likelihood of being cost-effective as compared to vaccination only at a willingness to pay threshold of US$ 1200. Conclusions HBIG following <b>confirmatory</b> <b>test</b> is not a cost-effective strategy for preventing vertical transmission of HBV in the Thailand-Myanmar border population.

40|$|The {{specificity}} of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) used for early infant diagnosis (EID) of HIV infection is < 100 %, leading some HIV-uninfected infants to be incorrectly identified as HIV-infected. The World Health Organization recommends that infants undergo a second NAAT to confirm any positive test result, but implementation is limited. Our {{objective was to}} determine the impact and cost-effectiveness of confirmatory HIV testing for EID programmes in South Africa. Using the Cost-effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC) -Pediatric model, we simulated EID testing at age 6 weeks for HIV-exposed infants without and with <b>confirmatory</b> <b>testing.</b> We assumed a NAAT cost of US$ 25, NAAT {{specificity of}} 99. 6 %, NAAT sensitivity of 100 % for infants infected in pregnancy or at least 4 weeks prior to testing, and a mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) rate at 12 months of 4. 9 %; we simulated guideline-concordant rates of testing uptake, result return, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation (100 %). After diagnosis, infants were linked to and retained in care for 10 years (false-positive) or lifelong (true-positive). All parameters were varied widely in sensitivity analyses. Outcomes included number of infants with false-positive diagnoses linked to ART per 1, 000 ART initiations, life expectancy (LE, in years) and per-person lifetime HIV-related healthcare costs. Both without and with <b>confirmatory</b> <b>testing,</b> LE was 26. 2 years for HIV-infected infants and 61. 4 years for all HIV-exposed infants; clinical outcomes for truly infected infants did not differ by strategy. Without <b>confirmatory</b> <b>testing,</b> 128 / 1, 000 ART initiations were false-positive diagnoses; with <b>confirmatory</b> <b>testing,</b> 1 / 1, 000 ART initiations were false-positive diagnoses. Because <b>confirmatory</b> <b>testing</b> averted costly HIV care and ART in truly HIV-uninfected infants, it was cost-saving: total cost US$ 1, 790 /infant tested, compared to US$ 1, 830 /infant tested without <b>confirmatory</b> <b>testing.</b> <b>Confirmatory</b> <b>testing</b> remained cost-saving unless NAAT cost exceeded US$ 400 or the HIV-uninfected status of infants incorrectly identified as infected was ascertained and ART stopped within 3 months of starting.

We also excluded clinical harms to HIV-uninfected infants incorrectly treated with ART after false-positive diagnosis (e. g., medication toxicities); including these outcomes would further increase the value of <b>confirmatory</b> <b>testing.</b> Without <b>confirmatory</b> <b>testing,</b> in settings with MTCT rates similar to that of South Africa, more than 10 % of infants who initiate ART may reflect false-positive diagnoses. <b>Confirmatory</b> <b>testing</b> prevents inappropriate HIV diagnosis, is cost-saving, and should be adopted in all EID programmes...|$|E
