Two remaining stake owners Darius Gudelis and Vilnius <b>City</b> <b>Municipality</b> retained their rights to the club (1/4 each).

Shortly after becoming new owner of the club, Guoga sparked discussions about changing the club's name and invited the public to offer their ideas since the team no longer have connections with the Vainauskas' newspaper Lietuvos rytas. The idea was strictly criticised by the club's elite fans group B Tribūna (Rytas Ultras), who told that the only team they will support is black-white-red Rytas. On June 21, 2017, the new owners organized a meeting, during which first changes were made: public institution Krepšinio rytas was renamed to Statyba in order to remember the historical BC Statyba, Darius Gudelis replaced Martynas Purlys in the club's director position and it was decided that the club's name Lietuvos rytas will be changed in not longer than 1-year term with the most likely but not yet final choice being Rytas. Guoga also told media that it is very likely that at least two Lithuanian basketball stars will participate in the team activities, bearing in mind Jonas Valančiūnas, Linas Kleiza and Arvydas Macijauskas. On July 4, 2017, Gudelis announced that former assistant coach Alberto Blanco and Linas Kleiza are joining the club, whose first task will be assisting Rimas Kurtinaitis to bring together new roster of the team. On July 13, 2017, press conference was held during which it was announced that Kleiza also became shareholder of the club by receiving part of the Guoga's stake, was named vice-president of the club and will also act as sports director.
