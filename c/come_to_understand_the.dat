5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. As they <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> workings of the Borg, La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using the Borg drone as {{a weapon of mass}} destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E

25|$|Davidson's work is {{well noted}} for its unity, as he has brought a similar {{approach}} {{to a wide variety}} of philosophical problems. Radical interpretation is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves imagining that you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not understand at all. How could you <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> language? One suggestion is that you know a theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is that sentence, or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its truth value, this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the biconditional (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning.|$|E

At first, he refused to believe that the diseases were carried by mosquitos because, he reasoned, the native population would have been more affected. At this time, the nature of human acquired immunity to diseases was not well understood. The Chicago Tribune, in an article about conditions in the canal, referred to the notion that yellow fever was carried by mosquitos as [...] "bugaboo". However, by January 1906, Magoon had long <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> role of mosquitos in the transmission of diseases, as evidenced in a New York Times article wherein Magoon addressed criticisms of his administration in detail; by then he had undertaken a vigorous and ambitious plan to eliminate the swamps that bred mosquitos.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{opposed to}} the {{inclusion}} of a bill of rights in the Constitution, he had gradually <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> importance of doing so during the often contentious ratification debates. By taking the initiative to propose amendments himself through the Congress, he hoped to preempt a second constitutional convention that might, it was feared, undo the difficult compromises of 1787, and open the entire Constitution to reconsideration, thus risking the dissolution of the new federal government. Writing to Jefferson, he stated, [...] "The friends of the Constitution, some from an approbation of particular amendments, others from a spirit of conciliation, are generally agreed that the System should be revised. But they wish the revisal to be carried no farther than to supply additional guards for liberty." [...] He also felt that amendments guaranteeing personal liberties would [...] "give to the Government its due popularity and stability". Finally, he hoped that the amendments [...] "would acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free government, and as they become incorporated with the national sentiment, counteract the impulses of interest and passion". Historians continue to debate the degree to which Madison considered the amendments of the Bill of Rights necessary, and to what degree he considered them politically expedient; in the outline of his address, he wrote, [...] "Bill of Rights—useful—not essential—".|$|E
500|$|Final Destination films, for {{the film}} and media studies scholar Eugenie Brinkema, are {{characterized}} by their {{move away from the}} typical horror antagonist and towards the certainty and inevitability of death. This makes the films inconsistent with many analyses of horror, according to which horror films require a monster. Final Destination films depart from other horror films, and even other horror films aimed at teens, in that they feature [...] "no families, no repression; no psychic, geographic, or domestic hauntings; and no sexuality—neither the pursuit of pleasure in the slasher convention of easy bodily access nor the monstrosity of sexual difference". The films, Brinkema argues, are not about the seeking of pleasure, as are paradigmatic slashers, but are instead about the avoidance of pain and death; they are [...] "constitutively bitter, anhedonic, paranoid, and sad". In the films, death becomes its own cause; the premonition of the roller-coaster derailment in Final Destination 3 is without context or cause, but the fact that some characters are able to avoid the death they would have had grounds the necessity of their deaths, in the order that they would have died on the roller coaster. Thus, [...] "Death's list" [...] or [...] "Death's design" [...] is realized. Final Destination 3 spends as much time interpreting deaths as displaying them. Wendy's close analysis of photographs allows her to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> deaths, but is inevitably too late. In the franchise's films, Brinkema says, [...] "one must closely read to survive (for a spell), and yet reading changes absolutely nothing at all". Thus, the characters [...] "might as well" [...] have stayed on the roller coaster.|$|E

500|$|Rose is {{introduced}} in the eponymous premiere episode of the 2005 series. There, she is saved from an Auton attack by the mysterious alien Time Lord known as the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), and assists him in preventing an invasion of Earth. Subsequently, the Doctor invites Rose to be his travelling companion, taking her {{to the end of}} the world and giving her a [...] "superphone" [...] so she can remain in contact with her mother Jackie (Camille Coduri), and boyfriend Mickey (Noel Clarke). In their travels through time and space, Rose learns the importance of not tampering with history, when she attempts to save the life of her father Pete Tyler (Shaun Dingwall), who had died when she was a baby. Throughout these journeys, she and the Doctor are haunted by two mysterious recurring words: 'Bad Wolf'. Rose, the Doctor, and new companion Captain Jack (John Barrowman) <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> meaning of this phrase when they encounter an unstoppable army of evil alien Daleks on the space station Satellite 5. To return to the Doctor after he sends her home to Earth in series finale [...] "The Parting of the Ways", Rose tears open the console of the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, and becomes suffused with the power of the time vortex. Returning, she uses her power over the infinity of time and space to spread the words [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] over its entirety, then saving the universe from the Dalek invasion. [...] Rose resurrects Jack, who died from Dalek fire, and destroys the Dalek fleet before the Doctor drains the energy out of her—by kissing her—to save her life from its harmful effects. Rose is horrified as the Doctor appears to die and regenerates into a new man (David Tennant), who proceeds to take the TARDIS and a terrified Rose to Earth, abandoning Jack on Satellite 5.|$|E

2500|$|Noddings {{believes}} {{that it would be}} a mistake to try to provide a systematic examination of the requirements for caring; nevertheless, she does suggest three requirements for caring (Caring 1984, 11-12). She argues that the carer (one-caring) must exhibit engrossment and motivational displacement, and the person who is cared for (cared-for) must respond in some way to the caring (1984, 69). Noddings' term engrossment refers to thinking about someone in order to gain a greater understanding of him or her. Engrossment is necessary for caring because an individual's personal and physical situation must be understood before the one-caring can determine the appropriateness of any action. 'Engrossment' need not entail, as the term seems to suggest, a deep fixation on the other. It requires only the attention needed to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> position of the other. Engrossment could not on its own constitute caring; someone could have a deep understanding of another person, yet act against that person's interests. Motivational displacement prevents this from occurring. Motivational displacement occurs when the one-caring's behaviour is largely determined by the needs of the person for whom she is caring. On its own, motivational displacement would also be insufficient for ethical caring. For example, someone who acted primarily from a desire to accomplish something for another person, but failed to think carefully enough about that other person's needs (failed to be correctly engrossed in the other), would fail to care. Finally, Noddings {{believes that}} caring requires some form of recognition from the cared-for that the one-caring is, in fact, caring. When there is a recognition of and response to the caring by the person cared for, Noddings describes the caring as [...] "completed in the other" [...] (1984, 4).|$|E
