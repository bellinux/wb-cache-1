The company can be an airline company or a market intermediary offering contracts on this important commodity.

50|$|Triangular {{arbitrage}} (also {{referred to}} as <b>cross</b> <b>currency</b> arbitrage or three-point arbitrage) is the act of exploiting an arbitrage opportunity resulting from a pricing discrepancy among three different currencies in the foreign exchange market. A triangular arbitrage strategy involves three trades, exchanging the initial currency for a second, the second currency for a third, and the third currency for the initial. During the second trade, the arbitrageur locks in a zero-risk profit from the discrepancy that exists when the market cross exchange rate is not aligned with the implicit cross exchange rate. A profitable trade is only possible if there exist market imperfections. Profitable triangular arbitrage is very rarely possible because when such opportunities arise, traders execute trades that {{take advantage of the}} imperfections and prices adjust up or down until the opportunity disappears.|$|E
5000|$|A {{constant}} maturity swap is {{an interest rate}} swap where the interest rate on one leg is reset periodically, but with reference to a market swap rate rather than LIBOR. The other leg of the swap is generally LIBOR, but may be a fixed rate or potentially another {{constant maturity}} rate. Constant maturity swaps can either be single currency or <b>cross</b> <b>currency</b> swaps. Therefore, the prime factor for a constant maturity swap is {{the shape of the}} forward implied yield curves. A single currency constant maturity swap versus LIBOR is similar to a series of differential interest rate fixes (or [...] "DIRF") {{in the same way that}} an interest rate swap is similar to a series of forward rate agreements. Valuation of constant maturity swaps depend on volatilities of different forward rates and therefore requires a stochastic yield curve model or some approximated methodology like a convexity adjustment, see for example Brigo and Mercurio (2006).|$|E
50|$|When the 1973 {{oil crisis}} {{affected}} the world capitalist economy, economic restructuring {{was used to}} remedy the situation by geographically redistributing production, consumption, and residences.City economies across the globe moved from goods-producing to service-producing outlets.Breakthroughs in transportation and communications made industrial capital much more mobile. Soon, a quaternary or producer services emerged as a fourth basic economic sector where routine low-wage service employment moved to low-cost sites and advanced corporate services centralized in cities. These technological upheavals brought about changes in institutional arrangements with the prominence of large corporations, allied business and financial services, nonprofit and public sector enterprises. Global cities such as New York and London become centers for international finance and headquarters for multinational corporations offering <b>cross</b> <b>currency</b> exchange services as well as buildup of foreign banking and trading.

In all these urban areas the corporate complex grows offering banking, insurance, advertising, legal council, and other service functions.

40|$|Abstract. The nominal {{exchange}} rate {{is both a}} macroeconomic variable equilibrating international markets and a …nancial asset that embodies expectations and prices risks associated with <b>cross</b> border <b>currency</b> holdings. Recognizing this, we adopt a joint macro-…nance strategy to model the {{exchange rate}}. We incorporate into a monetary exchange rate model macroeconomic stabilization through Taylor-rule monetary policy on one hand, and on the other, market expectations and perceived risks embodied in the cross-country yield curves. Using monthly data between 1985 and 2005 for Canada, Japan, the UK and the US, we employ a state-space system to model the relative yield curves between country-pairs using the Nelson and Siegel (1987) latent factors, and combine them with monetary policy targets (output gap and in‡ation) into a vector autoregression (VAR) for bilateral exchange rate changes. We …nd strong evidence that both the …nancial and macro variables are important for explaining exchange rate dynamics and excess currency returns, especially for the yen and the pound rates relative to the dollar. Moreover, by decomposing the yield curves into expected future yields and bond market term premiums, we show that both expectations about future macroeconomic conditions and perceived risks are priced into the currencies. These …ndings provide support for {{the view that the}} nominal exchange rate is determined by both macroeconomic as well as …nancial forces...|$|R
