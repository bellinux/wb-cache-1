5|$|Grass is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their molars are {{particularly}} suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life. Most grass-eating mammals are quite large {{and have a}} long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by coprophagy, the eating of their own feces. However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called cecotropes, which recycle B vitamins, fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion. The cecotropes (or <b>caecal</b> pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behaviour with rabbits. In geriatric boars or sows (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.|$|E

6000|$|Sir Godfrey was a rationalist and a residuum. Very much of him, {{too much}} perhaps, {{had gone into}} the acquirement and perfect {{performance}} of the <b>caecal</b> operation; the man one met in the social world was what was left over. It had the effect of being quiet, but in its unobtrusive way knobby. He had a knobby brow, with an air about it of having recently been intent, and his conversation was curiously spotted with little knobby arrested anecdotes. If any one of any distinction was named, he would reflect and say, [...] "Of course,--ah, yes, I know him, I know him. Yes, I did him a little service--in '96." ...|$|E
60|$|Benham's mother, whom he saw {{quarterly}} {{and also}} {{on the first of}} May, because it was her birthday, touched and coloured his imagination far more than his father did. She was now Lady Marayne, and a prominent, successful, and happy little lady. Her dereliction had been forgiven quite soon, and whatever whisper of it remained was very completely forgotten during the brief period of moral kindliness which followed the accession of King Edward the Seventh. It no doubt contributed to her social reinstatement that her former husband was entirely devoid of social importance, while, on the other hand, Sir Godfrey Marayne's temporary monopoly of the <b>caecal</b> operation which became so fashionable in the last decade of Queen Victoria's reign as to be practically epidemic, created a strong feeling in her favour.|$|E

50|$|The {{appendix}} (or vermiform appendix; also cecal <b>caecal</b> appendix; vermix; or vermiform process) is a blind-ended tube {{connected to}} the cecum, from which it develops in the embryo. The cecum is a pouchlike structure of the colon, located at the junction of the small and the large intestines.|$|E
50|$|When haying, pikas harvest {{plants in}} a {{deliberate}} sequence, corresponding to their seasonal phenology. They seem {{to assess the}} nutritional value of available food and harvest accordingly. Pikas select plants that have the higher caloric, protein, lipid and water content. Forbs and tall grass tend to be hayed more than eaten directly. Haypiles tend to be stored under the talus near the talus-meadow interface although they may be constructed on the talus surface. Males generally store more vegetation than females and adults usually store more than juveniles. Pikas deposit two kinds of fecal droppings: Hard brown round pellets and <b>caecal</b> pellets that are soft black shiny strings that form in the caecum. <b>Caecal</b> pellets have more energy value than stored plant food and the pika may consume them directly or store them for later.|$|E
5000|$|The re-ingestion of <b>caecal</b> content {{also serves}} to {{maintain}} the ringtail possum’s energy balance. Ringtail possums gain much of their gross energy from reingestion. The common ringtail possum has a daily maintenance nitrogen requirement (MNR) of 290 mg N/kg0.75. Common ringtail possums gain much of their MNR from consuming their nitrogen-rich <b>caecal</b> pellets. They would have to gain 620 mg N/kg0.75 otherwise. The ringtail possum recycles 96% of its liver's urea, which is then transferred into the caecum and made into bacterial protein. Only re-ingestion makes this effective and the bacterial protein must be digested in the stomach and the amino acids subsequently absorbed in the small intestine. [...] This recycling also allows the possum to conserve water and urinate less. Reingestion allows the possum to live on low nitrogen eucalyptus leaves which is particularly important during late lactation.|$|E
50|$|Their {{relatively}} big shell has an onic or turriform {{shape with}} a common, prominent, spiral sculpture. The radula shows a rhachidian tooth with no basal cusps. Their stomach has a <b>caecal</b> appendix at its pyloric end. They have a Hydrobia-like central nervous system, a simple penis and a characteristic, big seminal receptacle {{at the end}} of a prominent spiral of the coiled oviduct.|$|E
5000|$|Caudotestis ventichthysi is {{a species}} of flatworm inhabiting {{hydrothermal}} vent fishes (particularly Ventichthys biospeedoi) in the south eastern Pacific Ocean. It can be distinguished from its family by its symmetrical testicular configuration; its uterus passing between the testes. Furthermore, what differentiates it from its cogenerates is <b>caecal</b> length; cirrus sac length; its internal seminal vesicle's shape; [...] extent and arrangement, as well as forebody length and egg-size.|$|E
50|$|What {{distinguishes the}} {{digestive}} {{system of the}} common ringtail possum {{from that of the}} koala and the greater glider is the <b>caecal</b> content transfers directly back to the stomach. Because of this, the ringtail possum is able to gain more protein. This is also done by lagomorphs like rabbits and pikas. Hard faeces are produced during the night while feeding and are not eaten, while soft faeces are produced during the day during rests and are eaten.|$|E
50|$|This {{endoparasite}} {{causes a}} condition often called strongylosis or 'grouse disease' and {{which can be}} the cause of regular crashes in grouse populations. When the adult worm burrows into the caeca walls it causes a lot of damage and internal bleeding which in itself is harmful to the grouse. The worms ultimately reduce the digestive efficiency thus affecting the condition of the grouse.The eggs of the strongyle worm found in the <b>caecal</b> droppings of Red Grouse, hatch out into a microscopic larvae stage. Living within the dropping they feed off bacteria and organic matter they develop through two moults reaching their third larval stage, 'L3'. The 'L3' larvae is now at its infective stage so it 'swims' up heather stalks, on a thin film of liquid, to the young shoots where it is most likely to be ingested by a host. Once in the body of a host they enter one of the two caecum in the intestine of the host where the larvae develop into adult worms. The adults mate within the caeca and the female can lay over 100 eggs a day which are passed out in the <b>caecal</b> dropping.|$|E
50|$|After ingestion, {{the virus}} destroys the lymphoid follicles in the bursa of Fabricius {{as well as}} the {{circulating}} B-cells in the secondary lymphoid tissues such as GALT (gut-associated lymphoid tissue), CALT (conjunctiva), BALT (Bronchial) <b>caecal</b> tonsils, Harderian gland, etc. Acute disease and death is due to the necrotizing effect of these viruses on the host tissues. Kidney failure is a common cause of mortality. If the bird survives and recovers from this phase of the disease, it remains immunocompromised which means it is more susceptible to other diseases.|$|E
50|$|In a {{mouse model}} of sepsis caused by <b>caecal</b> {{ligation}} and puncture, RvD2 decreased local and systemic bacterial burden, excessive cytokine production and neutrophil recruitment, while increasing peritoneal mononuclear cells and macrophage phagocytosis {{as well as}} animal survival; in a mouse model of burn-related sepsis, RvD2 likewise increased survival when mice were injected with a lethal amount of endotoxin. RvD2 also reduced neutrophil accumulation, plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, and plasma levels of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor while increasing perfusion recovery {{as well as the}} number of regenerating myocytes in injured muscle tissue in a mouse model of hind limb ischemia.|$|E
5000|$|Cecotropia , also caecotrophia , <b>caecal</b> pellets, {{or night}} feces, {{are the product}} of the cecum, a part of the {{digestive}} system in mammals of the order lagomorpha, which includes two families: Leporidae (hares and rabbits), and Ochotonidae (pikas). Cecotropes are passed through the intestines and subsequently reingested for added nutrients in a process known as [...] "cecotrophy", [...] "cecophagy", [...] "pseudorumination", [...] "refection", coprophagia or [...] "coprophagy". Reingestion is also practiced by a few species of rodent (such as the capybara and guinea pig), marsupials (particularly their young) and possibly two species of primate (gorillas and chimpanzees).|$|E
5000|$|When <b>caecal</b> pellets are wet and runny (semi-liquid) {{and stick}} to the rabbit and {{surrounding}} objects they are called ontermittent soft cecotropes (ISCs). This is different from ordinary diarrhea and is usually caused by a diet too high in carbohydrates or too low in fiber. Soft fruit or salad items such as lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes are possible causes. Increasing dietary fiber and decreasing carbohydrates should restore the gut flora to normal in the cecum and return gastrointestinal tract motility to normal. This can be avoided by providing a healthy diet of unlimited grass hay as the main part with fibrous green foods such as broccoli and cabbage and limited high fiber/low energy pellets. Note also {{that there are other}} more serious but uncommon causes such as cancer, intestinal obstructions and abscesses.|$|E
50|$|The adult female worm resides {{within the}} adult male worm's gynaecophoric canal, {{which is a}} {{modification}} of the ventral surface of the male, forming a groove. The paired worms move against {{the flow of blood}} to their final niche in the mesenteric circulation, where they begin egg production (>32 days). The S. mansoni parasites are found predominantly in the small inferior mesenteric blood vessels surrounding the large intestine and <b>caecal</b> region of the host. Each female lays approximately 300 eggs a day (one egg every 4.8 minutes), which are deposited on the endothelial lining of the venous capillary walls. Most of the body mass of female schistosomes is devoted to the reproductive system. The female converts the equivalent of almost her own body dry weight into eggs each day. The eggs move into the lumen of the host's intestines and are released into the environment with the faeces.|$|E

50|$|With {{some other}} parasites young birds {{play host to}} more of the parasites than adults, as the adults develop {{immunity}} to the parasites {{but not in the}} case of the strongyle worm. With age the worm burden in grouse generally increases as each worm in the intestine of the grouse has to be individually ingested and the adult birds appear to have little resistance to the parasite. The burden of worms is obtained when the birds feed on heather and the young birds feed mainly on insects, for this reason this parasite has little direct bearing on chick survival but can badly affect adults and immature birds.High worm burdens in grouse can lead to mortality and poor condition leading to easy predation and poor reproduction. The strongyle worm burrows into the <b>caecal</b> mucosa which affects the bird's ability to control the scent it emits making them particularly susceptible to mammalian predators who hunt using scent. High burden leading to poor condition of the hen grouse may not affect the clutch size but can affect her ability to incubate the eggs or brood the chicks so this parasite may indirectly affect chick mortality.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{anaerobic}} status of the <b>caecal</b> biotope in the rabbit through the measurement of its redox potential (Eh). Since the <b>caecal</b> content has a high viscosity, {{the duration of the}} Eh measurement is high (10 to 20 min) and two methods were compared in 10 week- old rabbits: in vivo vs. post-mortem. In addition, Eh, pH and temperature of the <b>caecal</b> digesta were analysed according to caecotrophy and three periods in the day (soft faeces production: 08 : 00 - 10 : 00 h and 12 : 00 - 14 : 00 h; hard faeces production: 17 : 00 - 19 : 00 h) were compared, using 34 rabbits aged 65 d and weighing 2. 3 kg. <b>Caecal</b> Eh decreased 2 min after measurement began, and then stabilised from 20 min onwards (from − 152 to 221 mV, P< 0. 001), in contrast to <b>caecal</b> pH which remained constant over time.

40|$|Campylobacter jejuni is an {{important}} zoonotic foodborne pathogen causing acute gastroenteritis in humans. Chickens are often colonized at very high numbers by C. jejuni, up to 10 (9) CFU per gram of <b>caecal</b> content, with no detrimental effects on their health. Farm control strategies are being developed to lower the C. jejuni contamination of chicken food products {{in an effort to}} reduce human campylobacteriosis incidence. It is believed that intestinal microbiome composition may affect gut colonization by such undesirable bacteria but, although the chicken microbiome is being increasingly characterized, information is lacking on the factors affecting its modulation, especially by foodborne pathogens. This study monitored the effects of C. jejuni chicken <b>caecal</b> colonization on the chicken microbiome in healthy chickens. It also evaluated the capacity of a feed additive to affect <b>caecal</b> bacterial populations and to lower C. jejuni colonization. From day- 0, chickens received or not a microencapsulated feed additive and were inoculated or not with C. jejuni at 14 days of age. Fresh <b>caecal</b> content was harvested at 35 days of age.
