40|$|A {{numerical}} {{analysis of the}} mode of deformation of the main load-bearing components of a typical frame sloping shaft headgear was performed. The analysis was done by a design model consisting of plane and solid finite elements, which were modeled in the program «LIRA». Due to the numerical results, the regularities of local stress distribution under a <b>guide</b> <b>pulley</b> bearing were revealed and parameters of a plane stress under both emergency and normal working loads were determined. In the numerical simulation, the guidelines to improve {{the construction of the}} joints of <b>guide</b> <b>pulleys</b> resting on sub-pulley frame-type structures were established. Overall, the results obtained are the basis for improving the engineering procedures of designing steel structures of shaft sloping headgear...|$|R

50|$|The {{lower part}} of the bow of the vessel, instead of being made solid as usual, is {{composed}} of two iron flaps, each hinged at the top, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. When closed, the outer surfaces of these flaps correspond to the general shape of the bow, and, when the torpedo machinery is not being worked, they are kept down in their places by means of chains attached to them near their lower edges, and passing in through a pair of hawsepipes situated between the flaps. Each chain, after entering its hawsepipe, is attached to an iron rod, these rods passing into the vessel through stuffing-boxes at the inner ends of the hawsepipes. From the inner ends of these rods chains are led, over <b>guide</b> <b>pulleys,</b> to the ends of a winch, situated as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and by means of this winch, which is worked by hand, the flaps can be closed when required. The opening of the flaps is effected by the arrangements shown in Figs. 1 and 4, from which it will be seen that each flap has a chain attached to its outside, and that these chains, after being led up over <b>guide</b> <b>pulleys</b> supported by brackets placed {{at the level of the}} gunwale, are crossed and then led down through hawseholes in the deck to the winch below. The chains for opening, in fact, form continuations of those for closing the flaps, or vice versa.|$|R

The trajectory of conveyor chain links which respectively meshed and ran on sprockets and <b>chain</b> <b>guides</b> was recorded by a high speed camera. Furthermore, impact-contact forces by a collision of components in the conveyor chain drive system during rotation were analysis.

50|$|Although {{variations}} exist, {{as noted}} below, most rear derailleurs have several components in common. They have a cage that holds two <b>pulleys</b> that <b>guide</b> the <b>chain</b> in an S-shaped pattern. The pulleys {{are known as}} the jockey <b>pulley</b> or <b>guide</b> <b>pulley</b> (top) and the tension pulley (bottom). The cage rotates in its plane and is spring-loaded to take up chain slack. The cage is positioned under the desired sprocket by an arm that can swing back and forth under the sprockets. The arm is usually implemented with a parallelogram mechanism to keep the cage properly aligned with the chain as it swings back and forth. The {{other end of the}} arm mounts to a pivot point attached to the bicycle frame. The arm pivots about this point to maintain the cage at a nearly constant distance from the different sized sprockets. There may be one or more adjustment screws that control the amount of lateral travel allowed and the spring tension.|$|R
