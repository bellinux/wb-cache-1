50|$|<b>Clofoctol</b> is a {{bacteriostatic}} antibiotic. It {{is used in}} {{the treatment}} of respiratory tract and ear, nose and throat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria.It is marketed in France under the trade name Octoplus and in Italy as Gramplus.|$|E
40|$|A {{microbiological}} assay {{was undertaken}} {{to measure the}} amounts of <b>clofoctol</b> in human plasma and pulmonary tissue, and to investigate its pharmacokinetics. <b>Clofoctol</b> was extracted from samples using ethanol and the concentration of drug in the extracts {{was determined by the}} broth macrodilution method using as reference microorganisms S. aureus ATCC 29213 and B. cereus NCIB 8122, whose MIC values were 0. 537 and 1. 074 micrograms/ml respectively. This procedure allows the almost complete recovery of the drug and makes it possible to detect amounts of <b>clofoctol</b> as low as 5. 5 micrograms/ml. Results indicate that <b>clofoctol</b> is well absorbed after a single rectal dose of 1. 5 g, with a plasma Cmax at the 30 th min after administration and an average AUC value of 80. 91 micrograms/ml/h. The Cmax of lung tissue (which was higher than the plasmatic one) occurred at the 90 th min and the average AUC value was 229. 65 micrograms/ml/h, indicating good penetration of <b>clofoctol</b> into human lung tissue and appreciable tissue storage of the drug...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>clofoctol</b> {{was investigated}} in rat plasma and tissues after both oral and rectal treatment at a single dose of 300 mg/kg. After oral administration the plasmatic peak was 2. 12 +/- 0. 92 microgram/ml, occurring at the 90 th min, with T/ 2 of 121. 45 +/- 23. 41 min. After rectal administration a plasmatic peak of 1. 97 +/- 0. 61 microgram/ml was reached at the 20 th min with T/ 2 of 41. 07 +/- 12. 30 min. The kinetic profile of the drug in tissues exhibited a pattern {{similar to that in}} the plasma, since the maximal peak of <b>clofoctol</b> in tissues following rectal administration occurred before that obtained after oral administration. Tissue concentrations significantly higher than plasmatic ones were obtained through both administration routes. The present results indicate that <b>clofoctol</b> is well absorbed after both oral and rectal administration; however rectal treatment produces more rapid absorption and elimination compared with oral treatment...|$|E
40|$|Uropathogenic E. coli is a {{major cause}} of urinary tract infections (UTIs), but current {{antibiotics}} do not always effectively clear the persistent infection. To identify drugs that eliminate uropathogenic E. coli persisters, we screened a clinical drug library consisting of 1524 compounds using high throughput drug exposure assay in 96 -well plates. Bacterial survival was assessed by growth on LB plates. We identified 14 drug candidates (tosufloxacin, colistin, sparfloxacin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin, enrofloxacin and sarafloxacin, octodrine, <b>clofoctol,</b> dibekacin, cephalosporin C, pazufloxacin, streptomycin and neomycin), which had high anti-persister activity. Among them, tosufloxacin and colistin had the highest anti-persister activity and could completely eradicate E. coli persisters in 3 days in vitro while the current UTI antibiotics failed to do so. Our findings may have implications {{for the development of a}} more effective treatment for UTIs...|$|E
