30|$|Bipolar {{disorder}} {{is characterized by}} recurrent episodes of depression and (hypo)mania and {{in the form of}} sub-syndromal mood swings. A substantial proportion of patients with bipolar disorder does not experience full remission, remains symptomatic during inter-episode periods and experience daily mood swings above what is experienced by healthy individuals (Bopp et al. 2010; Judd et al. 2003; Joffe et al. 2004). Mood instability between affective episodes is associated with substantial disability and poor prognostic factors such as increased risk of hospitalization, high risk of relapse, and impaired functioning (Bopp et al. 2010; Judd et al. 2003; Joffe et al. 2004; Kupka et al. 2007; MacQueen et al. 2003; Strejilevich et al. 2013; Patel et al. 2015). This emphasizes the serious nature of bipolar disorder. Noticing the clinically and functionally impact of mood instability, mood instability has been suggested as a target for treatment and may be a more sensitive outcome measure in randomized <b>controlled</b> <b>maintenance</b> trials (RCT) than for example relapse or recurrence of affective episodes (Bopp et al. 2010; Bonsall et al. 2012; Saunders et al. 2016).

40|$|SummaryBacterial endosymbionts play {{essential}} {{roles for}} many organisms, and thus specialized mechanisms have evolved during evolution that guarantee {{the persistence of}} the symbiosis during or after host reproduction [1, 2]. The rice seedling blight fungus Rhizopus microsporus represents a unique example of a mutualistic life form in which a fungus harbors endobacteria (Burkholderia sp.) for the production of a phytotoxin [3]. Here we report the unexpected observation that in the absence of endosymbionts, the host is not capable of vegetative reproduction. Formation of sporangia and spores is restored only upon reintroduction of endobacteria. To monitor this process, we succeeded in GFP labeling cultured endosymbionts. We also established a laserbeam transformation technique for the first controlled introduction of bacteria into fungi to observe their migration to the tips of the aseptate hyphae. The persistence of this fungal-bacterial mutualism through symbiont-dependent sporulation is intriguing from an evolutionary point of view and implies that the symbiont produces factors that are essential for the fungal life cycle. Reproduction of the host has become totally dependent on endofungal bacteria, which in return provide a highly potent toxin for defending the habitat and accessing nutrients from decaying plants. This scenario clearly highlights the significance for a <b>controlled</b> <b>maintenance</b> of this fungal-bacterial symbiotic relationship...|$|E

40|$|ITER is an {{experimental}} thermonuclear reactor, {{which is supposed}} to solve challenges with energy resources in the future. Once the reactor is finished, it will require maintenance operations at times. Because of radiation in the reactor, maintenance operations are remotely controlled and therefore a remote diagnostics application is required for monitoring this remotely <b>controlled</b> <b>maintenance</b> system. This thesis focuses on developing the remote diagnostics application for remote handling systems of ITER. The application will be developed in co-operation with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland LTD and Tampere University of Technology. Aim of the project is to develop application for monitoring status and condition of the maintenance equipment and save acquired data into archives for investigation purposes. One of the main requirements for the application is that the application should be customisable and flexible. Application should be usable also with other types of equipment, not only with maintenance equipment. The application is rule-based and the operator should be able to create and edit these rules without aborting or recompiling the application. This caused some architectural problems to solve. The application is developed with graphical LabVIEW development software, which allowed many different approaches to the architectural problem. As a result of this thesis, a prototype of the Remote Diagnostics Application was created. The prototype was demonstrated for the customer in May 2017. Developing the application will continue and plans for the future development process are already done...|$|E
40|$|<b>Controlled</b> <b>maintenance</b> of {{multipotent}} {{stem cells}} {{is a key}} component for the development and sustainment of complex multicellular organisms. Various signalling pathways contribute to these processes being either lineage specific or more ubiquitously distributed over different tissue types. Transcription factors are considered as the primary propagators of signals that induce multipotent precursor cells to differentiate into specified cell types. These processes are required to revolve in a constrained and timely manner, with different cell types using variable sets of transcription factors and time scales. microRNA molecules represent an efficient and specific class of regulatory non-coding RNA molecules that efficiently constrain and specify differentiation cascades. New findings suggest that various endogenous non-coding RNA species, whose expression is governed through elaborate transcription factor networks, contribute to the regulation of genomewide transcriptional output. Here, evidence is presented of microRNA and transcription factor connectivity during differentiation cascades. First, these two classes of RNA regulatory molecules are shown to share a common target, lipoprotein lipase, and exert dynamical regulation over its expression during adipogenic differentiation. Second, investigating the genome-wide initial events of adipogenic and osteoblastic lineage commitment cascades reveals extensive transcription in non-protein-coding genomic regions. Further analysis of a select cohort of these non-coding transcripts allows for inferring transcription factor binding dynamics through enhancer-related RNA sequences as well as suggests a more wide-spread role for long non-coding RNA species in regulating transcriptional output. These findings contribute to unravelling basic transcriptional circuitry during cellular transitions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{heating system}} {{is widely used}} because it can sustain wide range of {{temperature}}. So temperature control is of prime importance. The heating systems are used for <b>controlled</b> <b>maintenance</b> of indoor ambient characteristics in optimal manner. The objective of these systems is to achieve comfortable and pleasant sensation of people staying in the warm area. The heating control problem is tackled by a fuzzy control scheme. Fuzzy logic systems are employed to maintain the room temperature in required range by determines the maximum and minimum for temperature. One important Artificial Intelligence tool for automatic control {{is the use of}} fuzzy logic controllers, which are fuzzy rule-based systems comprising expert knowledge in form of linguistic rules. These rules are usually constructed by an expert in the field of interest who can link the facts with the conclusions. Fuzzy Logic is a paradigm for an alternative design methodology, which can be applied in developing both linear and non-linear systems for embedded control. By using fuzzy logic, designers can realize lower development costs, superior features and better end product performance. In control systems {{there are a number of}} generic systems and methods which are encountered in all areas of industry and technology. From the dozens of ways to control any system, it turns out that fuzzy is often the very best way. The only reasons are faster and cheaper. One of successful application that used fuzzy control is heating control system.

40|$|Detailed {{physical}} oceanographic and sedimentological data, {{collected from}} a coastal embayment and adjoining inner continental shelf, {{are used to}} exemplify the changes in sediment transport vectors which take place when wave action is superimposed upon that of tidal currents. The area selected for study is one which is subjected to large tidal ranges (10. 2 m on spring tides) and occasional storm-induced swell waves (with a predicted 50 -year maximum wave height of 15 m). Bedload transport vectors are determined, {{on the basis of}} self-recording current meter observations combined with transport formulae and fluorescent or radioactive sand tracer studies, for: 1. (i) an ‘open’ area of the inner shelf, with regular bathymetry running parallel to the coastline; 2. (ii) a ‘near-coastal’ location, where current flow is constricted by the coastline itself; and 3. (iii) in the vicinity of a linear sandbank, which rises some 10 m above the surrounding sea bed. On the basis of analyses carried out for various tidal and wave conditions, the outer (‘open’) area is considered to be one through which sedimentary material passes from the offshore deep water areas to adjacent beaches. Here, the net transport paths are susceptible to wave action and can reverse during storms, in comparison to tidal currents alone. Inshore, the sandbank is at the ‘distal’ end of the transport system: sand is concentrated onto the bank by recirculating tidal currents, but is removed from its crestline by wave action. Wave action also intensifies sand transport rates around such an effectively ‘closed’ system, enhancing the hydrodynamically <b>controlled</b> <b>maintenance</b> process...|$|E

When there is more extensive left sided colonic disease, the efficacy of 5 -ASA rectal preparations is not as high, but it is still much improved over that seen with oral 5 -ASA preparations. There is no data available for total colonic disease of either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. There is no <b>controlled</b> <b>maintenance</b> data available for Crohn's disease using 5 -ASA preparations and no controlled or comparison data available for rectal preparations in Crohn's disease. There are no controlled dose-response studies of 5 -ASA in patients with Crohn's disease. Thus, the most "therapeutic" dose is not known. The author's anecdotal evidence reports char patients with Crohn's disease affecting the rectum or left colon respond poorly to 5 -ASA enemas. However. with continued use of more than six weeks at least a 50 to 60 % respone is seen. In contrast, virtually all patients with ulcerative proctitis respond by six weeks and all are controlled by 10 to 12 weeks. When oral 5 -ASA is compared with conventional oral sulfasalazine therapy, the efficacy is comparable. However, with 5 -ASA the incidence of side effects is considerably lower; the number of patients discontinuing therapy is less; patient compliance is better, especially for the long term; dosage increase following inadequate action is more readily possible; and bacterial activation of the drug given is not necessary...|$|E

40|$|The public {{perception}} of spiders and scorpions is skewed towards the potential harm they can inflict in humans, despite recent scientific evidence that arachnid venom components might be useful as bioinsecticides or even human therapeutics. Nevertheless, arachnids are becoming more popular as pets in Europe, America and Asia, raising the question for regulatory agencies in these regions {{as to whether they}} need to take measurements to protect their citizens. In order to decide upon the necessary regulatory steps, they first need to determine which arachnids are actually dangerous to humans. This review therefore provides an overview of the current literature on verified bites and stings from spiders and scorpions with the aim of assessing their potential danger for human health. As a guideline, we also provide a list of those arachnid genera that we consider as potentially dangerous, which includes 10 spider and 11 scorpion genera. The arachnid genera classified as dangerous comprise {{less than a quarter of}} all extant scorpion species and only 0. 5 % of all spiders species, with the actual number most likely being much lower than that, as not all species in those genera might turn out to pose an actual threat for humans. In conclusion, we found that only a small percentage of scorpions and a minute percentage of all spiders can be considered as potentially dangerous to humans. While in some countries of origin the high incidence of envenomations by dangerous arachnids can result in a serious problem to the health system, we assessed the risk that the same species pose when kept as pets under <b>controlled</b> <b>maintenance</b> conditions as significantly lower.

40|$|Vesicle {{exocytosis}} involves {{number of}} essential protein families that cooperatively mediate physical attachment between the vesicle and the plasma membrane, including Rab GTPases, Sec 1 /Munc 18 proteins, and SNARE proteins. We have examined two specific molecules in the regulated exocytotic pathway, Munc 18 c and Rab 27 a, at sites of SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion in tissues {{integral to the}} <b>controlled</b> <b>maintenance</b> of blood glucose, adipocytes and pancreatic β-cells. We have hypothesized that Munc 18 c regulates the progression of GLUT 4 storage vesicle (GSV) trafficking and fusion via the insulin-induced alteration of its binding to the t-SNARE syntaxin 4. Our results indicate that Munc 18 c interaction with a conformationally folded syntaxin 4 acts as a negative regulator GSV docking. By comparison, syntaxin 4 mutants that promote a SNARE complex-forming conformation demonstrate {{a shift in the}} state of Munc 18 c interaction that is sufficient for GSV docking, and is likely to mimic insulin activation of GSV trafficking, resulting in increased GLUT 4 at the plasma membrane. Upstream of SM proteins, Rab GTPases and their effector proteins assist with the transport to and docking of vesicles at the plasma membrane, where they are believed to interact directly with the Munc 18 /syntaxin complex. We focused on identifying sites of Rab 27 a action in the insulin secretory pathways using membrane capacitance measurements of pancreatic β-cells isolated from Rab 27 a-null (ashen) mice. We demonstrate that Rab 27 a exerts dual roles in insulin granule exocytosis, facilitating the glucose-induced refilling of releasable granule pools while also limiting release from these pools. In summary, the investigations of this dissertation support a role for Munc 18 c and Rab 27 a in controlling both the timing and magnitude of vesicle docking and priming (i. e., SNARE complex formation) at the plasma membrane, thereby acting as crucial regulators in the regulated exocytotic pathways in glucose regulatory tissues...|$|E
40|$|Auxin is a {{structurally}} simple molecule, yet it elicits {{many different}} responses in plants. In Chapter 1 {{we have reviewed}} how specificity in the output of auxin signaling could be generated by distinct regulation and the unique properties {{of the members of}} the Aux/IAA and ARF transcription factor families. In Chapter 2 we further investigated the generation of specificity in auxin responses by generating a set of sensitive transcriptional reporter lines for all Arabidopsis ARFs. This facilitated a comprehensive identification of the ARF complement within a cell/tissue of interest. Our analysis of ARF expression in the root meristem revealed both ubiquitous and specific ARF expression patterns and ARF subsets that distinguished the actively dividing cells from those undergoing elongation. Moreover, a striking correlation between cell type and ARF expression patterns was revealed in the early Arabidopsis embryo, where each cell type expressed a unique ARF complement. In Chapter 3 we characterized a novel cell-autonomous auxin response is required for hypophysis specification and root meristem initiation, and identify Aux/IAA and ARF transcription factors that mediate this response. We show that auxin response components in the proembryo and the suspensor are intrinsically different, and their regulated, lineage-specific expression creates a prepattern enabling different developmental auxin responses. Surprisingly, we find that, in addition to mediating hypophysis specification, auxin response also acts to maintain suspensor cell identity. We show that auxin <b>controlled</b> <b>maintenance</b> of suspensor cell identity includes repression of the embryonic program. This finding gave us an experimental system in which to investigate suspensor cell identity and embryonic transformation.   In Chapter 4 the targeted and specific inhibition of auxin response in the suspensor was coupled to new embryo dissection techniques and a microarray based approach was used to generate a unique dataset which was subsequently mined for cell identity regulators. Unexpectedly, inhibition of auxin response induced the misregulation of thousands of genes, prior to gross morphological changes, revealing a high degree of transcriptional plasticity in these cells. This complicated the identification of regulators. Moreover, the dataset also included secondary/indirect changes in embryo expressed genes, which were inevitable given the connectivity and developmental connectedness between the embryo and suspensor. One of the most striking findings from analysis of the dataset generated in Chapter 4 was the convergent regulation of members of many gene families involved in all facets of auxin homeostasis, as investigated in Chapter 5. It appears that transient auxin response inhibition is sensed as an auxin minimum and in general auxin homeostasis genes were activated or repressed in such a way that would increase cellular auxin levels (and response). Finally, many bHLH superfamily members were misregulated upon the inhibition of suspensor auxin response and subsequently found to have specific expression patterns in the embryo, the focus of in Chapter 6. Several bHLHs were shown to lose their lineage specific expression patterns upon inhibition of auxin response in the suspensor, validating further research to place these factors into the auxin response pathways controlling cell identity in the embryo.  ...|$|E
