5|$|<b>Cervical</b> cancer {{nearly always}} {{involves}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a virus with numerous strains, several of which predispose to precancerous {{changes in the}} <b>cervical</b> epithelium, particularly in the transformation zone, {{which is the most}} common area for <b>cervical</b> cancer to start. HPV vaccines, such as Gardasil and Cervarix, reduce the incidence of <b>cervical</b> cancer, by inoculating against the viral strains involved in cancer development.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cervical</b> {{incompetence}} is {{a condition}} in which shortening of the cervix due to dilation and thinning occurs, before term pregnancy. Short <b>cervical</b> length is the strongest predictor of preterm birth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cervical</b> polyps, {{which are}} benign {{overgrowth}}s of endocervical tissue, if present, may cause bleeding, or a benign overgrowth {{may be present}} in the <b>cervical</b> canal. <b>Cervical</b> ectropion refers to the horizontal overgrowth of the endocervical columnar lining in a one-cell-thick layer over the ectocervix.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cervical</b> {{stenosis}} {{refers to}} an abnormally narrow <b>cervical</b> canal, typically associated with trauma caused by removal of tissue for investigation or treatment of cancer, or <b>cervical</b> cancer itself. Diethylstilbestrol, used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent preterm labour and miscarriage, is also strongly associated {{with the development of}} <b>cervical</b> stenosis and other abnormalities in the daughters of the exposed women. Other abnormalities include: vaginal adenosis, in which the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix becomes columnar; cancers such as clear cell adenocarcinomas; <b>cervical</b> ridges and hoods; and development of a cockscomb cervix appearance.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cervical</b> canal is {{a passage}} through which sperm must travel to {{fertilize}} an egg cell after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including <b>cervical</b> caps and <b>cervical</b> diaphragms aim to block or prevent {{the passage of}} sperm through the <b>cervical</b> canal. <b>Cervical</b> mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the Creighton model and Billings method, due to its changes in consistency throughout the menstrual period. During vaginal childbirth, the cervix must flatten and dilate to allow the fetus to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use {{the extent of the}} dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 {{systematic}} review found consistent evidence that circumcision {{was associated with}} a decreased risk of <b>cervical</b> cancer, <b>cervical</b> dysplasia, HSV-2, chlamydia, and syphilis among women. The evidence was less consistent in regards to the potential association of circumcision with women's risk of HPV and HIV.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cervical</b> {{agenesis}} {{is a rare}} congenital {{condition in}} which the cervix completely fails to develop, often associated with the concurrent failure of the vagina to develop. Other congenital <b>cervical</b> abnormalities exist, often associated with abnormalities of the vagina and uterus. The cervix may be duplicated in situations such as bicornuate uterus and uterine didelphys.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cervical</b> cancer can {{be treated}} with either LDR, PDR or HDR brachytherapy.|$|E
5|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) is {{the most}} commonly transmitted sexually transmitted infection, affecting both men and women. While most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared by the immune system, some types of the virus cause genital warts, and other types, if untreated, cause various forms of cancer, including <b>cervical</b> cancer, and penile cancer. Genital warts and <b>cervical</b> cancer {{are the two most}} common problems resulting from HPV.|$|E
5|$|Lymphatic vessels {{from the}} {{parathyroid}} glands drain into deep <b>cervical</b> lymph nodes and paratracheal lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|Potentially precancerous {{changes in}} the cervix can be {{detected}} by <b>cervical</b> screening, using methods including a Pap smear (also called a <b>cervical</b> smear), in which epithelial cells are scraped {{from the surface of}} the cervix and examined under a microscope. The colposcope, an instrument used to see a magnified view of the cervix, was invented in 1925. The Pap smear was developed by Georgios Papanikolaou in 1928. A LEEP procedure using a heated loop of platinum to excise a patch of <b>cervical</b> tissue was developed by Aurel Babes in 1927. In some parts of the developed world including the UK, the Pap test has been superseded with liquid-based cytology.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. <b>Cervical</b> diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. <b>Cervical</b> caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken <b>cervical</b> mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the <b>cervical</b> canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken <b>cervical</b> mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cervical</b> canal {{is lined}} with a single layer of column-shaped cells, while the ectocervix is covered with {{multiple}} layers of cells topped with flat cells. The two types of epithelia meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, {{which can lead to}} cancer of the cervix. <b>Cervical</b> cytology tests can often detect <b>cervical</b> cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of <b>cervical</b> cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe's neck {{vertebrae}} have {{ball and}} socket joints. In particular, the atlas–axis joint (C1 and C2) allows the animal to tilt its head vertically and reach more branches with the tongue. The point of articulation between the <b>cervical</b> and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie {{between the first and}} second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh <b>cervical</b> vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra <b>cervical</b> vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven <b>cervical</b> vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of mammals have seven <b>cervical</b> vertebrae (bones in the neck), including bats, giraffes, whales and humans. The exceptions are the manatee and the two-toed sloth, which have just six, and the three-toed sloth which has nine <b>cervical</b> vertebrae. All mammalian brains possess a neocortex, a brain region unique to mammals. Placental mammals have a corpus callosum, unlike monotremes and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|A <b>cervical</b> mucus plug, {{called the}} operculum, forms inside the <b>cervical</b> canal during pregnancy. This {{provides}} a protective seal for the uterus against {{the entry of}} pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during {{the first stage of}} childbirth or shortly before. It is visible as a blood-tinged mucous discharge.|$|E
5|$|A {{result of}} {{dysplasia}} is usually further investigated, such as {{by taking a}} cone biopsy, which may also remove the cancerous lesion. <b>Cervical</b> intraepithelial neoplasia is a possible result of the biopsy, and represents dysplastic changes that may eventually progress to invasive cancer. Most cases of <b>cervical</b> cancer are detected in this way, without having caused any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include vaginal bleeding, discharge, or discomfort.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} ankylosaur osteoderms was {{published}} in 2000, and reviewed the armour of Struthiosaurinae. The group was represented by the single genus Struthiosaurus, known from head, <b>cervical,</b> dorsal, sacral, and caudal scutes. Only a few head osteoderms were identified, so it is unknown {{how much of the}} skull was armoured. Many <b>cervical</b> and dorsal scutes have been preserved alongside species of Struthiosaurus. They include <b>cervical</b> bands, which are groups of osteoderms fused together and attached to the vertebrae, and large spines found on the shoulders of nodosaurids like Sauropelta and Edmontonia, although it is not known if the spines were fused like the later of separate like the former. It is quite possible that small ovoid scutes found on Struthiosaurus could have formed a pelvic shield like polacanthids. The caudal scutes of struthiosaurines are small and rough. Even though osteoderms are well-known, it is not certain where they were positioned on the body.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} episode, 2% may {{experience}} a further episode {{within the first}} month. After this, there is a 1% annual risk of recurrence. Those {{with high blood pressure}} and dissections in multiple arteries may have a higher risk of recurrence. Further episodes of <b>cervical</b> artery dissection are more common in those who are younger, {{have a family history of}} <b>cervical</b> artery dissection, or have a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or fibromuscular dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|Barrier {{contraceptives}} are {{devices that}} attempt to prevent pregnancy by physically preventing sperm from entering the uterus. They include male condoms, female condoms, <b>cervical</b> caps, diaphragms, and contraceptive sponges with spermicide.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy is {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} early or locally confined <b>cervical</b> cancer and is a standard of care in many countries.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{treatment}} for <b>cervical</b> or prostate cancer can cause acute and transient urinary {{symptoms such as}} urinary retention, urinary incontinence or painful urination (dysuria).|$|E
5|$|<b>Cervical</b> {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for <b>cervical</b> cancer using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from <b>cervical</b> cancer, since most cases occur in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} {{methods that}} rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar-based methods. Methods that require observation {{of one or more}} of the three primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, <b>cervical</b> mucus, and <b>cervical</b> position) are known as symptoms-based methods. Urine test kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors.|$|E
5|$|Globally, <b>cervical</b> {{cancer is}} the fourth commonest cancer amongst women, {{particularly}} those of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, <b>cervical</b> cancer accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, <b>cervical</b> {{cancer is the}} commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, <b>cervical</b> {{cancer was}} the third-most common cancer in women worldwide, with rates varying {{geographically}} {{from less than}} one to more than 50 cases per 100,000 women. It is {{a leading cause of}} cancer-related death in poor countries, where delayed diagnosis leading to poor outcomes is common. The introduction of routine screening has resulted in fewer cases of (and deaths from) <b>cervical</b> cancer, however this has mainly taken place in developed countries. Most developing countries have limited or no screening, and 85% of the global burden occurring there.|$|E
5|$|Like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, {{and other}} styracosternans, Eolambia has <b>cervical</b> {{vertebrae}} {{which are very}} opisthocoelous, meaning that their front ends are strongly convex while their back ends are strongly concave. Unusually, {{the front end of}} the third <b>cervical</b> is set slightly higher than the back end, which is not seen in any other <b>cervical</b> vertebrae. Vertebrae from further back in the neck have a greater angle between the elongate articular processes known as the postzygapophyses, and also more elongate transverse processes. On the transverse processes, there are further articular processes – the rounded parapophyses and rod-like diapophyses – are located. In the rearmost cervicals, there is also a deep depression separating the postzygapophyses, and the neural spines have steeply-angled front margins, which has the effect of creating prominent spike-like projections.|$|E
5|$|Prognosis of {{spontaneous}} <b>cervical</b> arterial dissection involves neurological and arterial results. The overall functional prognosis {{of individuals with}} stroke due to <b>cervical</b> artery dissection {{does not appear to}} vary from that of young people with stroke due to other causes. The rate of survival with good outcome (a modified Rankin score of 0–2) is generally about 75%, or possibly slightly better (85.7%) if antiplatelet drugs are used. In studies of anticoagulants and aspirin, the combined mortality with either treatment is 1.8–2.1%.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A <b>cervical</b> screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. <b>Cervical</b> stenosis, the narrowing of the <b>cervical</b> opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
5|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} at the <b>cervical</b> (neck) level {{result in}} full or partial tetraplegia (also called quadriplegia). Depending {{on the specific}} location and severity of trauma, limited function may be retained.|$|E
5|$|The holotype FMNH PR1821 is {{the only}} fully {{described}} specimen of Cryolophosaurus. The specimen consists of an incomplete skull and mandibles lacking most of their front half; nine maxillary teeth; a fragmentary sixth <b>cervical</b> centrum; <b>cervical</b> vertebrae 7-10; several posterior <b>cervical</b> ribs; several anterior dorsal vertebrae; most mid and posterior dorsal vertebrae; several dorsal ribs; the fifth sacral vertebrae; three chevrons; many partial and complete caudal vertebrae and centra; two partial humeri; a proximal radius; a proximal ulna; a partial ilium; a proximal pubis; both ischia, but only one distal; two incomplete femora; the distal end of a tibia; the distal end of a fibula, and the astragalus and calcaneum. In 2013, new material of Cryolophosaurus was unearthed in Antarctica. The description of this material {{has not yet been}} published in a non-abstract form.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of streptococcal pharyngitis are a sore throat, fever of greater than , tonsillar exudates (pus on the tonsils), and large <b>cervical</b> lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|Using {{hormonal}} combined contraceptive pills {{also helps}} {{in reducing the}} chances of PID by thickening the <b>cervical</b> mucosal plug & hence preventing the ascent of causative organisms from the lower genital tract.|$|E
25|$|A {{whiplash}} injury from {{an automobile}} accident is called a <b>cervical</b> acceleration–deceleration injury. Cadaver {{studies have shown that}} as an automobile occupant is hit from behind, the forces from the seat back compress the kyphosis of the thoracic spine, which provides an axial load on the lumbar spine and <b>cervical</b> spine. This forces the <b>cervical</b> spine to deform into an S-shape where the lower <b>cervical</b> spine is forced into a kyphosis while the upper <b>cervical</b> spine maintains its lordosis. As the injury progresses, the whole <b>cervical</b> spine is finally hyper-extended.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide, <b>cervical</b> {{cancer is}} both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an {{estimated}} 528,000 cases of <b>cervical</b> cancer occurred, with 266,000 deaths. This is about 8% of the total cases and total deaths from cancer. About 70% of <b>cervical</b> cancers occur in developing countries. In low-income countries, {{it is the most}} common cause of cancer death. In developed countries, the widespread use of <b>cervical</b> screening programs has dramatically reduced rates of <b>cervical</b> cancer. In medical research, the most famous cell line known as HeLa was developed from <b>cervical</b> cancer cells of a woman named Henrietta Lacks.|$|E
25|$|The Australian <b>Cervical</b> Cancer Foundation (ACCF), {{founded in}} 2008, {{promotes}} 'women’s health by eliminating <b>cervical</b> cancer and enabling treatment {{for women with}} <b>cervical</b> cancer and related health issues, in Australia and in developing countries.' Ian Frazer, one of the developers of the Gardasil <b>cervical</b> cancer vaccine, is the scientific advisor to ACCF. Janette Howard, the wife of former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, was diagnosed with <b>cervical</b> cancer in 1996, and first spoke on her battle with the disease in 2006.|$|E
