5000|$|The crisis {{came to a}} head {{during the}} April 1925 General Conference. Smith's brother Israel A. Smith, a member of the Presiding Bishopric (who would later succeed his brother as church president), feared terrible {{consequences}} if President Smith forced a vote on his Supreme Directional <b>Control</b> <b>document.</b> In a letter to his brother dated April 5, Israel wrote: [...] "If you, because of the mere force of numbers, drive out the strong belief and feelings of the opposition, you shall become responsible to that degree of falling away, the loss of faith, the division which may ensue." [...] The document was debated for a full five days, April 7-11, and finally passed on a vote of 915 to 405, becoming General Conference Resolution (GCR) 849. In response, the Presiding Bishopric resigned, along with Apostle John Rushton; the conference also failed to sustain a second opposition apostle, Thomas W. Williams, ending his ministry in that office. [...] On April 18, Smith issued a revelation (enshrined as Section 135 in the Community of Christ's Doctrine and Covenants) indicating divine approval of his course of action with regard to the Supreme Directional <b>Control</b> <b>document</b> and the resignation of the Bishopric.|$|E

This term paper examines, thru interviews, which factors that have an influence on the subjects contents in the A course of Social Sciences at Swedish high schools. Having interviewed four active teachers at three different schools, it shows that <b>control</b> <b>documents</b> like subject- and national curricula have little to say {{about what kind of}} subject that should been taught. Teachers seem rather to rely on local collegiate consensus, the textbook, locally prepared <b>control</b> <b>documents,</b> and adjusting to program directions while choosing material. In the final discussion the risk of structuring the subject around the text book is being investigated, along the fact that new locally <b>control</b> <b>documents</b> need to be written even for basic planning structures. Given the fact that the <b>control</b> <b>documents</b> are couched in general terms, the paper finally claims on account on this matter that pupils rights’ for equal education are being jeopardized.   Key words: Didactics, Social Sciences, Education, National Curriculum, Social Sciences Curriculum, Selection Matter...|$|R

5000|$|The International Space Station Cupola {{was first}} {{conceived}} in 1987 by Space Station Man-Systems Architectural Control Manager Gary Kitmacher as a workstation for operating the station’s Canadarm2 robotic arm, maneuvering vehicles outside the station, and observing and supporting spacewalks. He likened the use as {{similar to that}} of the Shuttle Orbiter Aft Flight Deck. There were to have been two Cupolas, one on either end of the racetrack shape formed by the station modules and nodes. It was initially named the [...] "windowed workstation", to distinguish it from other computer-based workstations inside of the station and from which the crew could operate the station’s systems. Once the idea was initially accepted, a number of people went to work. Human factors specialist Frances Mount began to develop the rationale and operational scenarios for the Cupola, and got considerable support from Chief Astronaut John Young and Shuttle Commander Gordon Fullerton. Charles Wheelwright, who had defined the specifications for every window on every prior United States manned spacecraft, began to define the design specifications of the Cupola windows. Laurie Weaver, who had just started with NASA as a student intern ("Co-Op"), began to work on a series of different configurations for the Cupola. She started with Kitmacher’s idea, based on the Shuttle Aft Flight Deck, in this case two Aft Flight Decks mounted back to back, placed atop a short cylinder. An inexpensive mock-up made of PVC tubes was built and tested underwater, where critical dimensions could be measured to ensure that two crew members in zero-g would have adequate access. Then she built a series of small cardboard models, looking at a variety of different alternative shapes. The different configurations and their positive and negative attributes were presented at a series of Crew Station Reviews over the next year in which participants rated each. The Cupola that evolved was octagonal in shape, with eight similar windows around the periphery, four quadrant windows overhead, and mounted on a cylinder. The module was designed to fully contain at least two crewmembers [...] "floating" [...] side by side in zero-g neutral body posture. About this time, Kitmacher and designer Jay Cory applied the term Cupola for the first time. Kitmacher wrote the requirements and the name into the Man-Systems Architectural <b>Control</b> <b>Document</b> and into the requests for proposals for Work Package 1 at MSFC and Work Package 2 at JSC. Later, Kitmacher went on to lead the Man-Systems group, leading the first lunar outpost and moonbase studies and the Cupola reappeared on several of his rover and module designs.|$|E
