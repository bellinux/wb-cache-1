The user can perform full global docking, or focus on par-ticular residues that are implicated in binding.

30|$|To {{carry out}} the blind docking protocol, the entire surface of the CYP 3 A 4 was divided into 90 focus docking regions.

To identify the most preferred binding locations, we combined all docking results and ranked them with the lowest binding energy of the largest <b>docking</b> <b>cluster.</b> As we are not only interested in the binding energies as indicators for adequate binding, we defined a hit as the docking run that includes at least 20 % of the total population in its largest cluster. Finally, the solvent-exposed atoms that were used to construct the docking boxes have been used as markers for the binding locations.|$|R

40|$|Homotypic yeast vacuole fusion {{occurs in}} three stages: (i) priming reactions, which are {{independent}} of vacuole <b>clustering,</b> (ii) <b>docking,</b> in which vacuoles cluster and accumulate fusion proteins and fusion regulatory lipids at a ring-shaped microdomain surrounding the apposed membranes of each docked vacuole, where fusion will occur, and (iii) bilayer fusion/compartment mixing. These stages require vacuolar SNAREs, SNARE-chaperones, GTPases, effector complexes, and chemically minor but functionally important lipids. For each, we have developed specific ligands that block fusion and conditions that reverse each block. Using them, we test whether docking entails a linearly ordered series of catalytic events, marked by sequential acquisition of resistance to inhibitors, or whether docking subreactions are cooperative and/or reversible. We find that each fusion protein and regulatory lipid is needed throughout docking, indicative of a reversible or highly cooperative assembly of the fusion-competent vertex ring. In accord with this cooperativity, vertices enriched in one fusion catalyst are enriched in others. Docked vacuoles finally assemble SNARE complexes, yet still require physiological temperature and lipid rearrangements to complete fusion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Reverse docking {{approaches}} have been explored {{in previous studies}} on drug discovery to overcome some problems in traditional virtual screening. However, current reverse docking approaches are problematic in that the target spaces of those studies were rather small, and their applications were limited to identifying new drug targets. In this study, we expanded the scope of target space {{to a set of}} all protein structures currently available and developed several new applications of reverse docking method. Results We generated 2 D Matrix of docking scores among all the possible protein structures in yeast and human and 35 famous drugs. By <b>clustering</b> the <b>docking</b> profile data and then comparing them with fingerprint-based clustering of drugs, we first showed that our data contained accurate information on their chemical properties. Next, we showed that our method could be used to predict the druggability of target proteins. We also showed that a combination of sequence similarity and docking profile similarity could predict the enzyme EC numbers more accurately than sequence similarity alone. In two case studies, 5 -flurouracil and cycloheximide, we showed that our method can successfully find identifying target proteins. Conclusions By using a large number of protein structures, we improved the sensitivity of reverse docking and showed that using as many protein structure as possible was important in finding real binding targets. </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{performance}} of the ZDOCK and ZRANK algorithms in CAPRI rounds 13 - 19 and introduce a novel measure atom contact frequency (ACF). To compute ACF, we identify the residues that most often make contact with the binding partner in the complete set of ZDOCK predictions for each target. We used ACF to predict the interface of the proteins, which, in combination with the biological data available in the literature, is a valuable addition to our docking pipeline. Furthermore, we incorporated a straightforward and efficient clustering algorithm with two purposes: (1) to determine <b>clusters</b> of similar <b>docking</b> poses (corresponding to energy funnels) and (2) to remove redundancies from the final set of predictions. With these new developments, we achieved at least one acceptable prediction for targets 29 and 36, at least one medium-quality prediction for targets 41 and 42, and at least one high-quality prediction for targets 37 and 40; thus, we succeeded for six {{out of a total of}} 12 targets...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEnergy {{evaluation}} using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) enables sampling {{billions of}} putative complex structures and hence revolutionized rigid protein–protein docking. However, in current methods, efficient acceleration is achieved only {{in either the}} translational or the rotational subspace. Developing an efficient and accurate docking method that expands FFT-based sampling to five rotational coordinates is an extensively studied but still unsolved problem. The algorithm presented here retains the accuracy of earlier methods but yields at least 10 -fold speedup. The improvement is due to two innovations. First, the search space is treated as the product manifold SO(3) ×(SO(3) ∖S 1), where SO(3) is the rotation group representing {{the space of the}} rotating ligand, and (SO(3) ∖S 1) is the space spanned by the two Euler angles that define the orientation of the vector {{from the center of the}} fixed receptor toward the center of the ligand. This representation enables the use of efficient FFT methods developed for SO(3). Second, we select the centers of highly populated <b>clusters</b> of <b>docked</b> structures, rather than the lowest energy conformations, as predictions of the complex, and hence there is no need for very high accuracy in energy evaluation. Therefore, it is sufficient to use a limited number of spherical basis functions in the Fourier space, which increases the efficiency of sampling while retaining the accuracy of docking results. A major advantage of the method is that, in contrast to classical approaches, increasing the number of correlation function terms is computationally inexpensive, which enables using complex energy functions for scoring...|$|R
40|$|Bovine viral {{diarrhoea}} virus (BVDV), a major pathogen in {{cattle and}} other ruminants, {{has been used}} as a surrogate in vitro model for the development of HCV inhibitors. Recently, we have identified a very potent and selective benzimidazole derivative (227 G) that: i) targets the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of both BVDV and HCV, ii) allows the selection of BVDV resistant mutants characterized by the point mutation I 261 M located in the finger domain of the enzyme. This work deals with the effects of 227 G and I 261 M on the function of the wt and mutated BVDV RdRp, respectively, investigated by using non-conventional approaches that include molecular dynamics, <b>cluster</b> analysis, flexible <b>docking</b> and metadynamics. Briefly, binding of 227 G to the wt RdRp induces conformational changes that prevent entrance of the RNA primer into the enzyme's polymerization cavity. Viceversa, the I 261 M mutation results in structural changes that allow access of the primer to the polymerization cavity and binding of 227 G into a site different from that occupied by the inhibitor in the wt enzyme...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLectins {{display a}} variety of {{strategies}} for specific recognition of carbohydrates. In several lectin families from different origin, one or two calcium ions {{are involved in the}} carbohydrate binding site with direct coordination of the sugar hydroxyl groups. Our work implied a molecular docking study involving a set of bacterial and animal calcium-dependant lectins in order to compare the ability of three docking programs to reproduce key carbohydrate-metal interactions. Flexible docking was performed using AutoDock, DOCK and GLIDE softwares. All docking packages were almost able to predict the carbohydrate binding orientations but not in every instance the result was obvious to evaluate. DOCK showed good results according to crystallographic information but not in all tested cases the lowest energy conformation identified the experimental data. GLIDE presented the same difficulty in result analysis but the lowest energy pose was always a satisfactory solution, able to mimic the real carbohydrate orientation. AutoDock showed a reasonable accuracy in sugar orientation prediction based on <b>docking</b> <b>cluster</b> number ranking and most accurate distances between calcium and sugar hydroxyl groups.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies on orexin peptides and receptors have indicated amino acids important for ligand binding and receptor activation. However, {{a better understanding}} of specific pairwise interactions would benefit small molecule discovery. Results We constructed a set of three-dimensional models of the orexin 1 receptor based on the 3 D-structures of the orexin 2 receptor (released while this manuscript was under review), neurotensin receptor 1 and chemokine receptor CXCR 4, conducted an exhaustive docking of orexin-A 16 – 33 peptide fragment with ZDOCK and RDOCK, and analyzed a total of 4301 complexes through multidimensional scaling and <b>clustering.</b> The best <b>docking</b> poses reveal two alternative binding modes, where the C-terminus of the peptide lies deep in the binding pocket, on average about 5 – 6  Å above Tyr 6. 48 and close to Gln 3. 32. The binding modes differ in the about 100 ° rotation of the peptide; the peptide His 26 faces either the receptor’s fifth transmembrane helix or the seventh helix. Both binding modes are well in line with previous mutation studies and partake in hydrogen bonding similar to suvorexant. Conclusions We present two binding modes for orexin-A into orexin 1 receptor, which help rationalize previous results from site-directed mutagenesis studies. The binding modes should serve small molecule discovery, and offer insights into the mechanism of receptor activation...|$|R
40|$|Density {{functional}} theory calculations {{were used}} to investigate the stability of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) attached to nanoparticles. The total energies and the adhesion energies between the CNTs and the nanoparticles were calculated for systems where the nanoparticles were either pure Ni or Ni carbide. It {{was found that the}} adhesion between the CNT and a pure Ni cluster is stronger than between the same CNT and a Ni carbide cluster although the energy difference was small compared to the total adhesion energies. This adhesion strength implies that CNTs are likely to remain attached to both pure Ni and Ni carbide clusters and that either pure Ni or Ni carbide <b>clusters</b> may be <b>docked</b> onto the open CNT ends to achieve continued growth or electronic contacts between CNTs and electrode materials. The system with a CNT attached to a pure Ni cluster was found to be energetically favored compared to a system containing the same CNT attached to a Ni carbide. The difference in total energy implies that a CNT should act as a sink for C atoms dissolved in the Ni carbide cluster, which means that the dissolved C atoms will be drained from the cluster, yielding a pure metal in the zero Kelvin thermodynamic limit. It is argued that this draining procedure is likely to occur even if carbon is added to the cluster at a proper rate, for example, during CNT growth...|$|R
40|$|Docking of a {{flexible}} ligand to a rigid protein, followed by molecular dynamics (MD) studies to allow {{movement of the}} protein is {{shown to be a}} useful method for investigating pharmacologically relevant interactions. Studies of MMB lectins (beta-sheet proteins with shallow binding sites) reveal the importance of dimerisation to the activation of all of the carbohydrate binding sites of these lectins, finalising site III into a shape that can accommodate mannose. Aloe lectin was shown to have the overall fold of a MMB lectin and to be capable of forming a dimeric unit, shown to be stable using MD simulations in a water box. Docking shows that only two binding sites in the aloe dimer are thought to be able to bind mannose, as alterations in the residues vital for binding have occurred, and this is supported by the absence of a <b>cluster</b> of <b>docked</b> conformations in these sites. The presence of many 'sticky' patches on the exterior of aloe lectin are observed, revealing extended binding areas consistent {{with other members of the}} family. The motions of the mannose molecules in the binding areas during the molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the hydrogen bonds observed in these protein-carbohydrate complexes are dynamic in nature and can be constantly breaking and reforming. Docking of atropine to the GPCR m 1 AchR (an alpha-helical transmembrane protein with and enclosed binding site) indicates the presence of two key hydrogen bonds with Ser 109 and Asn 110. The main influences on docking seem to be shape and size of the ligand rather than charge considerations, although the negatively charged end of the binding pocket orients the molecules in the majority of the dockings in the same direction. Docking studies of atropine and selected analogues to m 1 AchR and two mutants, Tyr 381 Phe and Tyr 381 Ala, produce data which correlate well with experimentally determined pIC 50 values and a prediction of pIC 50 of previously untested antagonists for this system. Molecular dynamics studies show differential movement in the transmembrane helices for MD studies with acetylcholine, atropine and no ligand bound and rearrangement of some key hydrogen bonds. This leads to a model of inverse agonist functionality for atropine and its analogues involving the prevention of helical movement by the aromatic tail groups of these ligands...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the bacterial leucine transporter from Aquifex aeolicus (LeuT(Aa)) {{has been used as}} a model for mammalian Na+/Cl [...] dependent transporters, in particular the serotonin transporter (SERT). The crystal {{structure of}} LeuT(Aa) liganded to tricyclic antidepressants predicts simultaneous binding of inhibitor and substrate. This is incompatible with the mutually competitive inhibition of substrates and inhibitors of SERT. We explored the binding modes of tricyclic antidepressants by homology modeling and docking studies. Two approaches were used subsequently to differentiate between three <b>clusters</b> of potential <b>docking</b> poses: 1) a diagnostic SERTY 95 F mutation, which greatly reduced the affinity for [H- 3] imipramine but did not affect substrate binding; 2) competition binding experiments in the presence and absence of carbamazepine (i. e., a tricyclic imipramine analog with a short side chain that competes with [3 H] imipramine binding to SERT). Binding of releasers (para-chloroamphetamine, methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine/ecstasy) and of carbamazepine were mutually exclusive, but Dixon plots generated in the presence of carbamazepine yielded intersecting lines for serotonin, MPP+, paroxetine, and ibogaine. These observations are consistent with a model, in which 1) the tricyclic ring is docked into the outer vestibule and the dimethyl-aminopropyl side chain points to the substrate binding site; 2) binding of amphetamines creates a structural change in the inner and outer vestibule that precludes docking of the tricyclic ring; 3) simultaneous binding of ibogaine (which binds to the inward-facing conformation) and of carbamazepine is indicative of a second binding site in the inner vestibule, consistent with the pseudosymmetric fold of monoamine transporters. This may be the second low-affinity binding site for antidepressants...|$|R
40|$|Cdc 25 phosphatases {{involved}} in cell cycle checkpoints are now active {{targets for the}} development of anti-cancer therapies. Rational drug design would certainly benefit from detailed structural information for Cdc 25 s. However, only apo- or sulfate-bound crystal structures of the Cdc 25 catalytic domain have been described so far. Together with previously available crystalographic data, results from molecular dynamics simulations, bioinformatic analysis, and computer-generated conformational ensembles shown here indicate that the last 30 - 40 residues in the C-terminus of Cdc 25 B are partially unfolded or disordered in solution. The effect of C-terminal flexibility upon binding of two potent small molecule inhibitors to Cdc 25 B is then analyzed by using three structural models with variable levels of flexibility, including an equilibrium distributed ensemble of Cdc 25 B backbone conformations. The three Cdc 25 B structural models are used in combination with flexible <b>docking,</b> <b>clustering,</b> and calculation of binding free energies by the linear interaction energy approximation to construct and validate Cdc 25 B-inhibitor complexes. Two binding sites are identified on top and beside the Cdc 25 B active site. The diversity of interaction modes found increases with receptor flexibility. Backbone flexibility allows the formation of transient cavities or compact hydrophobic units {{on the surface of the}} stable, folded protein core that are unexposed or unavailable for ligand binding in rigid and densely packed crystal structures. The present results may help to speculate on the mechanisms of small molecule complexation to partially unfolded or locally disordered proteins.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{system for}} docking a miniature spacecraft {{with a larger}} spacecraft has been developed by engineers at the Johnson Space Center. Engineers working on Mini AERCam, a free-flying robotic camera, needed {{to find a way}} to successfully dock and undock their miniature spacecraft to refuel the propulsion and recharge the batteries. The subsystems developed (see figure) include (1) a docking port, designed for the larger spacecraft, which contains an electromagnet, a ball lock mechanism, and a service probe; and (2) a <b>docking</b> <b>cluster,</b> designed for the smaller spacecraft, which contains either a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. A typical docking operation begins with the docking spacecraft maneuvering into position near the docking port on the parent vehicle. The electromagnet(s) are then turned on, and, if necessary, the docking spacecraft is then maneuvered within the capture envelope of the docking port. The capture envelope for this system is approximated by a 5 -in. (12. 7 -cm) cube centered on the front of the docking-port electromagnet and within an angular misalignment of < 30. Thereafter, the magnetic forces draw the smaller spacecraft toward the larger one and this brings the spacecraft into approximate alignment prior to contact. Mechanical alignment guides provide the final rotational alignment into one of 12 positions. Once the docking vehicle has been captured magnetically in the docking port, the ball-lock mechanism is activated, which locks the two spacecraft together. At this point the electromagnet(s) are turned off, and the service probe extended if recharge and refueling are to be performed. Additionally, during undocking, the polarity of one electromagnet can be reversed to provide a gentle push to separate the two spacecraft. This system is currently being incorporated into the design of Mini AERCam vehicle...|$|R

The method {{is based on the}} integration of the configurational integral over clusters obtained from multiple docked positions. We use a test set of 100 PDB protein-ligand complexes and ensembles of 101 docked positions generated by Wang et al [2] for each ligand in the test set. To test the suggested method we compare the averaged root-mean square deviations (RMSD) of the top-scored ligand docked positions, accounting and not accounting for entropy contributions, relative to the experimentally determined positions. We demonstrate that the method increases docking accuracy by 10 - 21 % when used in conjunction with the AutoDock scoring function, by 2 - 25 % with G-Score, by 7 - 41 % with D-Score, by 0 - 8 % with LigScore, by 1 - 6 % with PLP, by 0 - 12 % with LUDI, by 2 - 8 % with F-Score, by 7 - 29 % with ChemScore, by 0 - 9 % with X-Score, by 2 - 19 % with PMF, and by 1 - 7 % with DrugScore.

40|$|Pancreatic beta-cells secrete insulin in {{response}} to increase in blood glucose concentration with a rapid first phase and slower, sustained second phase. This secretion pattern is similar in entire pancreas, isolated islets of Langerhans and single beta-cells and it is disrupted in type 2 -diabetes. Insulin stored in secretory vesicles has to undergo preparatory steps upon translocation to the plasma membrane which include docking and priming before being released by exocytosis. A {{better understanding of the}} molecules involved in these steps is required to determine the rate limiting factors for sustained secretion. Here these processes were studied in real time using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, which enables observation of insulin granules localized at the plasma membrane. A pool of granules morphologically docked at the plasma membrane was found to be depleted upon repeated stimulations. Recovery of the docked pool of granules took tens of minutes and became rate limiting for sustained secretion. Shorter depolarization stimuli did not deplete the docked pool and allowed rapid recovery of releasable granules. When a new granule arrived at the plasma membrane, docking was initiated by de novo formation of syntaxin/munc 18 <b>clusters</b> at the <b>docking</b> site. Two-thirds of the granules which arrived at the plasma membrane failed to recruit these proteins and hence failed to dock. Priming involved recruitment of several other proteins including munc 13, SNAP 25 and Cav 1. 2 channels. Exocytosing granules were in close proximity to Ca 2 + influx sites with high degree of association with Cav 1. 2 channels. This is because of the association of these channels to exocytosis site through syntaxin and SNAP 25. During exocytosis the assembled release machinery disintegrated and the proteins at the release site dispersed. Syntaxin dispersal was initiated already during fusion pore formation rather than after release during exocytosis. This was studied using a newly developed red fluorescent probe - NPY-tdmOrange 2 which was the most reliable pH sensitive red granule marker to label insulin granules. Overall these data give new insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in biphasic insulin secretion. Disturbances in the secretion at the level of granule docking and fusion may contribute to the early manifestations of type- 2 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Entry of HIV- 1 {{into human}} lymphoid {{requires}} activities of viral envelope glycoproteins gp 120 and gp 41, and two host-cell proteins, the primary receptor CD 4 and a chemokine co-receptor. In addition, a third cell-surface protein called protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) {{is found to}} play a major role in HIV- 1 entry. PDI is capable of mediating thio-disulfide interchange reactions and could enable the reduction of gp 120 disulfide bonds, which triggers the major conformational changes in gp 120 and gp 41 required for virus entry. In this scenario, inhibition of HIV- 1 entry can be brought about by introducing agents that can block thiol-disulfide interchange reaction of cell surface PDI. There have been studies with agents that inhibit PDI activity, but the exact mode of binding remains to be elucidated; this might provide insights to develop new drugs to target PDI. This study attempts to perceive the mode of binding of dithionitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), and its structurally related compounds on PDI enzyme. Results We performed molecular docking simulation with six different inhibitors (ligand), which includes DTNB, NSC 695265, thionitrobenzoic acid, 2 -nitro- 5 -thiocyanobenzoic acid, 2 -nitro- 5 -sulfo-sulfonyl-benzoic acid and NSC 517871 into the redox-active site [C 37 -G 38 -H 39 -C 40] of the PDI enzyme and the activity was inferred by redox inhibitory models. All ligands showed favorable interactions and most of them seemed to bind to hydrophobic amino acids Ala 34, Trp 36, Cys 37, Cys 40, His 39, Thr 68 and Phe 80. The redox inhibitory conformations were energetically and statistically favored and supported the evidence from wet laboratory experiments reported in the literature. Conclusion We demonstrated that in silico docking experiment can be effectively carried out to recognize the redox inhibitory models of PDI with inhibitor molecules. Interestingly we found that number of <b>docked</b> <b>clusters</b> with each ligand varies in the range of five to eight and conveys that the binding specificity of each inhibitor varies for PDI. We also identified that Cys 37 of the enzyme plays an important role in hydrogen bonding with inhibitors. This residue can be considered to being an active site for anti-HIV drug design. Therefore, by inhibiting PDI, one can, not only prevent the viral entry but also circumvent the problem of viral resistance</p...|$|R
