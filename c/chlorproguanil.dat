50|$|Chlorproguanil/dapsone (sold commercially as Lapdap) was a fixed dose {{antimalarial}} combination containing <b>chlorproguanil</b> and dapsone, which act synergystically against malaria. The {{drug was}} withdrawn in 2008 following increasing evidence of toxicity {{in the form}} of haemolysis occurring in patients with G6PD deficiency.|$|E
50|$|The {{spread of}} {{drug-resistant}} malaria in Africa has encouraged {{the development of}} new, low-cost antimalarial drugs. Plasmodium falciparum, one of the Plasmodium species that causes malaria, has developed resistance both to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, {{two of the most}} common treatments for malaria. Artemisinin, another antimalarial drug, had been developed in the 1980s but was too expensive for large-scale use. This led GlaxoSmithKline to develop Lapdap, a combination drug consisting of <b>chlorproguanil</b> and dapsone. Lapdap was licensed in the United Kingdom starting in October 2003.|$|E
50|$|One {{advantage}} of Lapdap had was that <b>chlorproguanil</b> and dapsone are both low-cost drugs. Another was that {{by virtue of}} being of a combination drug, it was less likely to cause drug resistance. However, because dapsone causes hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, and because G6PD deficiency affects 10-25% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, it was discovered that Lapdap is not safe for use in Africa. It was available in many African countries for four years before GlaxoSmithKline took it off the market in February 2008.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made of Lapudrine (<b>chlorproguanil)</b> and Maloprim (pyrimethamine +dapsone) as malaria chemoprophylactics when given every two weeks for 3 years to Gambian {{children under the age of}} 5 years. Both drugs produced falls in spleen and malaria parasite rates and an increase in packed cell volume. Maloprim, but not <b>chlorproguanil,</b> significantly reduced the incidence of episodes of fever accompanied by malaria parasitaemia. Children who received Maloprim, but not those who received <b>chlorproguanil,</b> grew better than children in the placebo group. This finding suggests that brief clinical episodes of malaria are more important in impairing growth than more prolonged periods of asymptomatic parasitaemia. No serious side-effect attributable to either drug was observed.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the CYP 2 C 19 substrates, mephenytoin, methsuximide and mephobarbitone on the {{metabolism}} of proguanil and <b>chlorproguanil</b> by human liver microsomes were studied. All of the CYP 2 C 19 substrates significantly inhibited (P < 0. 05) the formation of both cycloguanil and chlorcycloguanil from their parent compounds. In the presence of mephenytoin (50 and 100 microM) the extent of proguanil cyclisation was decreased by 66 % and 67 % whilst the cyclisation of <b>chlorproguanil</b> was decreased by 51 % and 70 %, respectively. Methsuximide (50 and 100 microM) inhibited cycloguanil formation by 68 % and 77 % and chlorcycloguanil formation by 43 % and 58 %, respectively. In the presence of mephobarbitone (50 and 100 microM) the cyclisation of proguanil and <b>chlorproguanil</b> to their active metabolites was reduced by 24 % and 42 % and 48 % and 63 %, respectively. In addition, proguanil and <b>chlorproguanil</b> were shown to be mutual competitive inhibitors of metabolism to their triazine metabolites. In the presence of proguanil (50 and 100 microM) the Km value for chlorcycloguanil production was increased by 118 % and 200 %, respectively, with little change in Vmax. Similarly, chorproguanil (50 microM) increased the Km for the in vitro cyclisation of proguanil by 50 % with no alteration in Vmax.

Combinations of dapsone (approximately 4 mg/kg) plus ether proguanil (approximately 8 mg/kg; DP regimen; N = 10) or <b>chlorproguanil</b> (approximately 1. 4 mg/kg; DC regimen; N = 16) were given once a day for 3 days to adult Thai patients with acute, uncomplicated, falciparum malaria. The two regimens were well tolerated and had no side-effects, but the cure rates, assessed at 28 -day follow-up, were only 10 % for DP (60 % with RI response and 30 % with RII) and 14 % for DC (29 % with RI response and 57 % with RII). The mean (S. D.) fever-clearance times in those patients who were cured (S) or whose infections recrudesced (RI response) were 103 (56) h for those given DP and 90 (42) h for 6 those given DC. The corresponding parasite-clearance times were 83 (46) for DP and 53 (21) h for DC. In-vitro susceptibility testing of isolates obtained both before treatment and at recrudescence demonstrated marked resistance to cycloguanil, dapsone, chloroquine and mefloquine.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To compare {{treatment}} and protection against falciparum malaria in pregnant and non-pregnant women with three drug regimens. DESIGN [...] Prospective intervention study with six weeks' follow up. Patients received {{one of three}} drug regimens in order of entry. SETTING [...] Primary care hospital and secondary girls' school in rural western Kenya. PATIENTS [...] 158 of 988 pregnant women (89 primigravid and 69 multigravid) in the third trimester and 105 of 1488 non-pregnant schoolgirls of reproductive age were parasitaemic (more than 500 asexual forms/microliter. These women were divided into three treatment groups by gravid state. INTERVENTIONS [...] Women were treated with chloroquine base 25 mg/kg over three days or pyrimethamine 75 mg and sulfadoxine 1500 mg as a single dose or <b>chlorproguanil</b> 1. 2 mg/kg and dapsone 2. 4 mg/kg as a single dose. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Parasitaemia and haemoglobin concentrations measured at seven day intervals for six weeks. RESULTS [...] Primigravid {{women were more likely}} to be parasitaemic on follow up than multigravidas or nulligravidas, whose response was about the same. Parasites did not clear by day 7 in primigravidas in six (20 %) of 30 who received chloroquine, three (8 %) of 35 treated with pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine, and none of 23 treated with <b>chlorproguanil</b> and dapsone. At day 28, 83 %, 19 %, and 67 % of primigravidas in these treatment groups were parasitaemic. Haemoglobin concentrations rose in all women, but improvement was sustained only in women who remained free of parasites.

40|$|The {{combination}} of <b>chlorproguanil</b> and dapsone is being considered {{as an alternative}} antimalarial to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in Africa, because of its greater efficacy against resistant parasites, and its shorter half-lives, which exert less selective pressure {{for the emergence of}} resistance. A triple artesunate-chlorproguanil-dapsone combination is under development. In a previous study of relatively low-dose chlorproguanil-dapsone in multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria in Thailand failure rates were high. Proguanil is inexpensive, widely available and very similar to <b>chlorproguanil.</b> The safety and efficacy of artesunate-dapsone-proguanil (artesunate 4 mg/kg, dapsone 2. 5 mg/kg, proguanil 8 mg/kg daily for three days), was studied prospectively in 48 Thai adult patients with acute falciparum malaria followed daily for 28 days. Eleven of these had a recrudescence of their infection. Genotyping of Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) indicated that the Pfdhfr I 164 L mutation was the main determinant of therapeutic outcome; all 11 failures carried this mutation (failure rate 11 / 37; 30 %) whereas none of the 11 infections with 'wild type' 164 genotypes failed. The addition of artesunate considerably augments the antimalarial activity of the biguanide-dapsone combination, but this is insufficient for infections with parasites carrying the highly antifol-resistant Pfdhfr I 164 L mutation...|$|E
40|$|The {{disposition}} of chlorproguanil/dapsone (one daily dose for 3 d of 1. 2 and 2. 4 mg/kg respectively) {{has been studied}} in young children with Plasmodium falciparum malaria, to provide data complementary to a clinical trial of this drug combination. Unbound concentrations of chlorcycloguanil (the active metabolite of <b>chlorproguanil)</b> and dapsone in clinical samples have been related to the unbound drug concentrations which produced defined outcomes in tests in vitro of drug efficacy and toxicity. Twelve children with uncomplicated malaria were treated: all cleared parasitaemia within 72 h and made uneventful recoveries. After the first dose of chlorproguanil/dapsone the maximum unbound chlorcycloguanil concentration in clinical samples (19 ng/mL [about 60 nM]) was 2 orders of magnitude above the 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) value for this drug against the K 39 stain of P. falciparum, while falling 2 orders of magnitude below its IC 50 against human bone marrow cells; the maximum unbound dapsone concentration in clinical samples (160 ng/mL [about 645 nM]) was 10 -fold higher than its IC 50 against the K 39 strain. However, because of the rapid elimination of <b>chlorproguanil</b> from the body (half-life 12. 6 +/- 6. 3 h), the minimum fractional inhibitory concentrations of unbound chlorcycloguanil/dapsone against the K 39 strain were probably exceeded {{for no more than}} 6 d. These data, together with the clinical trial, will be helpful in deciding whether current chlorproguanil/dapsone doses are optimal for the treatment of falciparum malaria...|$|E

A recent study from Malawi reported this mutation at a prevalence of 4. 7 % in parasites from human immunodeficiency virus-positive pregnant women by using a real-time PCR method.

40|$|Abstract. Standard {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} methods often cannot detect drug-resistance mutations in Plasmodium falciparum infections if the mutation is present in 20 % of the parasites.

Using this assay, we confirmed {{the presence of the}} mutation in P. falciparum infections in Malawi. Drug resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is wide-spread in Malawi and is conferred by mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS). 1 – 4 The combination of five mutations (DHFR- 51,- 59, and- 108, and DHPS- 437 and- 540) has been strongly associated with SP failure. 5, 6 Other mutations, such as DHFR- 164, DHPS- 581, and DHPS- 613, develop later and sequentially add to SP re-sistance. 7 – 9 In addition, mutations in DHFR- 164 can confer resistance to pyrimethamine and <b>chlorproguanil.</b> 7, 10 This mu-tation is particularly important because its presence could limit the usefulness of the new artemisinin combinatio...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There were an {{estimated}} 207 million cases of malaria in 2012 of which 91 % {{were due to}} Plasmodium falciparum. Antimalarial drug resistance constitutes {{a major problem in}} the efforts to control malaria. Drug resistance typically arises by the gradual accumulation of genetic changes that enable parasites to tolerate gradually increasing drug concentrations until fully resistant parasites develop. The aim of this thesis was to determine temporal and geographic frequencies of genetic polymorphisms linked to P. falciparum and P. vivax resistance after exposure to various antimalarial drugs. METHODS: Polymorphisms in P. falciparum and P. vivax multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr 1 and pvmdr 1), dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr and pvdhfr) genes, P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps), V-type H+ pyrophosphatase (pfvp 2), Na+/H+ exchanger- 1 (pfnhe 1) and multidrug-resistant protein 1 (pfmrp 1) genes were determined in field samples. P. falciparum and P. vivax samples from Honduras, where drug resistant malaria has not been detected, were analysed for paper I. Samples from Honduras, Colombia, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Tanzania, Iran, Thailand and Vanuatu that represented varying origins and frequency of chloroquine (CQ) resistant P. falciparum malaria were analysed for paper II. Samples from 4 villages in Liberia in 1978 after children were administered village specific treatments of CQ, pyrimethamine (PYR), <b>chlorproguanil</b> or placebo monthly for 2 years were used for paper III.

40|$|Background: To {{assess the}} effect on malaria prevalence, village {{specific}} monthly administrations of pyrimethamine, <b>chlorproguanil,</b> chloroquine or placebo were given to children in four previously treatment-naive Liberian villages, 1976 - 78. Plasmodium falciparum in vivo resistance developed to pyrimethamine only. Selection of molecular markers of P. falciparum resistance after 2 years of treatment are reported. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 191 study children in a survey in 1978. Polymorphisms in pfcrt, pfmdr 1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmrp 1 and pfnhe 1 genes were determined using PCR-based methods. Results: Pfcrt 72 - 76 CVIET was found in one chloroquine village sample, all remaining samples had pfcrt CVMNK. Pfmdr 1 N 86 prevalence was 100 %. A pfmdr 1 T 1069 (ACT -> ACG) synonymous polymorphism was found in 30 % of chloroquine village samples and 3 % of other samples (P = 0. 008). Variations in pfnhe 1 block I were found in all except the chloroquine treated village (P < 0. 001). Resistance associated pfdhfr 108 N prevalence was 2 % in the pyrimethamine village compared to 45 - 65 % elsewhere, including the placebo village (P = 0. 001). Conclusions: Chloroquine treatment possibly resulted {{in the development of}} pfcrt 72 - 76 CVIET.

Methods: 1238 children aged 6 months to 10 years with uncomplicated malaria were randomized to receive CD or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and followed for 28 days. The first dose was supervised, subsequent doses given unsupervised at home. G 6 PD genotype was determined to assess the interaction between treatment and G 6 PD status in their effects on anaemia.

40|$|The artemisinins {{are playing}} an {{increasingly}} important role in treating multidrug-resistant malaria. The artemisinin, artesunate, is currently in use in Southeast Asia and is advocated for use in Africa. In these areas, {{more than one million}} people die of malaria each year, with the highest mortality occurring in children and pregnant women. To test the developmental toxicity in ICH-compliant animal studies, embryofetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits treated with artesunate alone or a three-drug combination (CDA) consisting of <b>chlorproguanil</b> hydrochloride, Dapsone, and artesunate in the ratio 1. 00 : 1. 25 : 2. 00. Developmental toxicity seen with CDA could be attributed to the administered dose of artesunate. The hallmark effect of artesunate exposure was a dramatic induction of embryo loss, apparent as abortions in rabbits and resorptions in both rats and rabbits. In addition, low incidences of cardiovascular malformations and a syndrome of skeletal defects were induced at or close to embryolethal doses of artesunate in both rats and rabbits. The cardiovascular malformations consisted of ventricular septal and vessel defects. The skeletal syndrome consisted of shortened and/or bent lonc, bones and scapulae, misshapen ribs, cleft sternebrae, and incompletely ossified pelvic bones. These developmental effects were observed largely {{in the absence of any}} apparent maternal toxicity. The no or low adverse effect levels were in the range of 5 to 7 mg/kg/day artesunate. Encouragingly, no adverse drug-related developmental effects have been observed in a limited number of pregnant women (more than 100 first trimester and 600 second and third trimester) treated with artemisinins, primarily artesunate.

40|$|The need to {{consider}} using dapsone in pregnant women for its antimalarial activity is becoming greater in areas where Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine and pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine is rapidly increasing. Dapsone {{in combination with other}} antimalarials might provide a valuable alternative for both treatment and prophylaxis. This review assesses the clinical pharmacology of dapsone and its adverse drug reactions in relation to haemolysis, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency, blood dyscrasias and methaemoglobinaemia. Studies are summarised reporting its use in leprosy, dermatological and other conditions, and malaria, in relation to maternal and infant outcomes. A total of 924 pregnancies were identified during which dapsone therapy was taken. Only limited data are available and this precludes a meaningful quantitative benefit-risk analysis. Mild degrees of haemolysis consistently occur with continued therapy, although adverse effects may be less likely with intermittent treatment, as most reported adverse effects have occurred with long-term use of dapsone. There are a number of gaps in knowledge where more data are needed. These include no data on pharmacokinetics in pregnancy and whether these are altered with co-administration of <b>chlorproguanil.</b> Potential complications in women with severe anaemia are unknown and there is no information on haemolytic effects in women or the fetus with G 6 PD deficiency. The use of dapsone in HIV-infected women in malarious areas could carry increased risks because of the immunosuppressive actions of the drug. Trials of dapsone therapy in pregnancy should be considered in malarious areas where there is good reason for its deployment. Controlled trials have provided data on maternal tolerance, and dapsone in combination with other antimalarial drugs can offer clear benefit in terms of improved birthweight.

Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected up to 24 h post-first dose. The pharmacokinetic analysis included 115 patients. For CPG, there was no significant effect of artesunate on C-max or AUC(0 - 24), except the 90 % confidence interval (CI) for AUC(0 - 24) for the 4 mg/kg artesunate dose was slightly below that for the standard bioequivalence range (90 % CI 0. 78, 1. 11); this was not considered clinically relevant. Artesunate increased the CCG AUC(0 - 24) by 6 - 17 % and C-max by 0 - 16 %. Artesunate had no significant effect on the rate or extent of absorption of DDS. For MADDS, artesunate increased the AUC(0 - 24) by 13 - 47 % and C-max by 8 - 45 %. For 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg artesunate dosing, artesunate AUC(0 -a) was 64. 6, 151 and 400 ng center dot h/ml and C-max 48. 9, 106 and 224 ng/ml respectively; DHA AUC(0 -a) was 538, 1, 445 and 3, 837 ng center dot h/ml and C-max 228, 581 and 1, 414 ng/ml respectively. Using a power model, the point estimates of slope were greater than 1 for artesunate AUC(0 -t) by 16 % and C-max by 5 % and for DHA by 39 and 21 % respectively. Artesunate did not significantly affect CPG or DDS pharmacokinetics. For CCG and MADDS, small to moderate increases in exposure with artesunate dosing were observed. There was a greater than proportional increase in artesunate and DHA exposure with increasing artesunate dose. These effects are not considered to be clinically relevant. It {{should be noted that the}} CPG-DDS-artesunate programme has now been stopped following unacceptable haematological toxicity in patients with glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency during a phase III trial. In addition, the CPG-DDS combination has been withdrawn from clinical use...|$|E
40|$|Chlorproguanil-dapsone (Lapdap), {{developed}} as a low-cost antimalarial, was withdrawn in 2008 after concerns about safety in G 6 PD deficient patients. This trial was conducted in 2004 to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CD and comparison with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) under conditions of routine use in G 6 PD normal and G 6 PD deficient patients with uncomplicated malaria in The Gambia. We also {{examined the effects of}} a common genetic variant that affects <b>chlorproguanil</b> metabolism on risk of treatment failure. 1238 children aged 6 months to 10 years with uncomplicated malaria were randomized to receive CD or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and followed for 28 days. The first dose was supervised, subsequent doses given unsupervised at home. G 6 PD genotype was determined to assess the interaction between treatment and G 6 PD status in their effects on anaemia. The main endpoints were clinical treatment failure by day 28, incidence of severe anaemia (Hb< 5 g/dL), and haemoglobin concentration on day 3. One third of patients treated with AL, and 6 % of patients treated with CD, did not complete their course of medication. 18 % (109 / 595) of children treated with CD and 6. 1 % (36 / 587) with AL required rescue medication within 4 weeks, risk difference 12 % (95 %CI 8. 9 %- 16 %). 23 children developed severe anaemia (17 (2. 9 %) treated with CD and 6 (1. 0 %) with AL, risk difference 1. 8 %, 95 %CI 0. 3 %- 3. 4 %, P =  0. 02). Haemoglobin concentration on day 3 was lower among children treated with CD than AL (difference 0. 43 g/dL, 95 % CI 0. 24 to 0. 62), and within the CD group was lower among those children who had higher parasite density at enrollment. Only 17 out of 1069 children who were typed were G 6 PD A- deficient, of these 2 / 9 treated with CD and 1 / 8 treated with AL developed severe anaemia. 5 / 9 treated with CD had a fall of 2 g/dL or more in haemoglobin concentration by day 3. AL was well tolerated and highly effective and when given under operational conditions despite poor adherence to the six-dose regimen. There were more cases of severe malaria and anaemia after CD treatment although G 6 PD deficiency was uncommon. Clinicaltrials. gov NCT 00118794...|$|E
