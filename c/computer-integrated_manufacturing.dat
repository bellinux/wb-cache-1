40|$|A {{number of}} current {{manufacturing}} sectors are striving hard to introduce innovative long-term strategies into their operations. As a result, many scholarly {{studies have found}} it fruitful to investigate advanced manufacturing strategies such as agile, <b>computer-integrated,</b> and cellular <b>manufacturing.</b> Through the example of downstream cases, manufacturing sectors have learned that financial benefits garnered through automated technologies cannot be counted on as a sole measure to ensure their success in today’s competitive and fluctuating marketplaces. The objective {{of this study is}} to integrate those advanced techniques with sustainable operations, to promote advanced sustainable manufacturing so those manufacturing sectors can thrive even in uncertain markets. To establish this connection, this study analyzes the drivers of advanced sustainable manufacturing through a proposed framework validated through a case study in India. Common drivers are collected from the literature, calibrated with opinions from experts, and analyzed through an analytical hierarchy process (AHP), which is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. This study reveals that quality is the primary driver that pressures manufacturing sectors to adopt advanced sustainable manufacturing. Manufacturers can easily note the top ranked driver and adopt it to soundly implement advanced sustainable manufacturing. In addition, some key future scopes are explored along with possible recommendations for effective implementation of advanced sustainable manufacturing systems...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{free-form surface}} design usually require tedious control-point {{manipulation}} and/or painstaking constraint specification via unnatural mouse-based interfaces. This paper presents a novel haptic approach for the direct manipulation of physics-based B-spline surfaces. Our method permits users to interactively sculpt virtual yet real material {{with a standard}} haptic device, and feel the physically realistic presence of virtual B-spline objects with force feedback throughout the design process. We aim to develop various haptic sculpting tools to expedite the direct manipulation of B-spline surfaces with haptic feedback and constraints. One significant contribution {{of this paper is}} that point, normal, and curvature constraints can be specified interactively and modified naturally using forces. We propose and formulate a dual representation for Bspline surfaces in both physical and mathematical space. This massspring model is mathematically constrained by the B-spline surface throughout the sculpting session. The equations of motion controlling the physical behavior of the B-spline surface are solved using a tractable numerical solver in real-time. The integration of haptics with traditional geometric modeling will increase the bandwidth of human-computer interaction, and thus shorten the time-consuming design cycle. We envision that this integrated approach promises a much greater potential in <b>computer-integrated</b> design and <b>manufacturing,</b> haptic interface, interactive graphics, medical applications, and virtual environments...|$|R

40|$|Thorough {{investigation}} and planning are essential {{steps in the}} deployment of Flexible Manufacturing Systems. At the present time, the most popular method of planning and analysis of these systems is computer-based modelling and simulation of which many varieties are commercially available. Ideally, during the modelling phase, the modeller should {{pay particular attention to}} such important details as reliability, damage propagation patterns, condition monitoring scenarios and the supervision aspects of these system as these factors are critical to the operation and performance of any envisaged configuration of FMS or its subsystems. In practice however, these are among the most neglected aspects of the models being constructed at the present time. This is in part because the present generation of commercially available simulation languages and environments are in many respects ill-equipped to deal with the challenges posed by the modelling of FMS. This thesis investigates the potential suitability of contemporary reliability and fault-mode description and analysis tools for inclusion within simulation models. Contemporary research work in analytical arid simulation-based reliability and fault-mode modelling and analysis of <b>computer-integrated</b> and flexible <b>manufacturing</b> systems have been investigated. A number of guidelines for the development of CIM and FMS simulation models have been developed. Four standard FMS models are developed and utilized as application examples in thesis. Analytical reliability techniques have been re-examined with special reference to the modelling of <b>computer-integrated</b> and flexible <b>manufacturing</b> systems. The potential sources of error and pitfalls of discrete-event simulation modelling have been outlined. The effect of the host languages, the different simulation time advancement modes, and the traditionally prescribed break-down modelling techniques have been investigated. Contemporary technology, programming and modelling concepts have been illustrated using PCModel and PROLOG. Fundamentals of "accurate" knowledge-based simulation modelling have been described and an alternative object-like structural implementation in a declarative environment has been proposed for the simulation models and tools. A detailed examination of the pre-requisites for the accurate simulation of reliability, fault-mode, and condition monitoring aspects of FMS has been performed. Some of the reliability and fault-mode modelling and analysis tools have been considered for their potential suitability as discrete-event simulation tools. Various possible resource-aging modes, health monitoring modules, and repairability /maintenance models have been developed. Micro-failure modelling and analysis has been proposed {{as an alternative to the}} traditional macro-failure modelling and analysis. Techniques for modelling of systems incorporating combinations of new and used equipment have been developed. A multi-phase development and demonstration of simulation models incorporating the tools and concepts proposed and cultivated during the course of the research has been undertaken. In each case, the model's evolution and the subsequent variations in its behaviour have been followed and examined from its bare-bone prototype to its fully developed stage. The research results in better understanding of reliability, condition monitoring and knowledge representation issues in simulation...|$|R
