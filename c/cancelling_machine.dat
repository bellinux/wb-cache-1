50|$|In {{the early}} days of stamps, {{cancellation}} with a pen was common. Today stamps are almost always cancelled with an inked handstamp or a machine cancel as this is quicker to apply. Pen cancels are still sometimes seen today when a postal official needs to cancel stamps missed by the automatic <b>cancelling</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Daguin {{machine was}} one of the first <b>cancelling</b> <b>machines</b> used by the French postal administration. It was created by [...] (1849-1888). Its first {{official}} use took place in June 1884 in Paris. It could cancel three thousand covers per hour.|$|R
50|$|Between June 1884 and {{the first}} years of the 20th century, the Daguin machine was a success in French post offices. But, it was {{replaced}} in towns because of the competition with new electric <b>cancelling</b> <b>machines.</b> They were faster and the mail was moved mechanically.|$|R
50|$|The {{field was}} opening to {{a slew of}} new developers. The next decade brought new {{competitors}} to the postal <b>cancelling</b> <b>machine</b> business, with the American Postal Machine Company introducing a line of devices in the 1890s noted for their speed. Soon there were scores of competitors hungry for business from the exploding volumes of United States mail.|$|E
50|$|But, the {{competition}} with electrical <b>cancelling</b> <b>machine</b> won when large and pictorial cancellations when Daguin commercial marks were text only. In the 1950s the last Daguin machines lasted in small post offices. For these, the PTT ordered a thousand Secap H in April 1952 and another thousand of Secap BB in 1960. Contracts for Daguin commercial cancellation were ordered {{not to be}} renewed and replaced with ondulated lines. Finally, all commercial printed by Daguin machine were forbidden in 1957.|$|E
5000|$|Leavitt, a {{resident}} of Malden, Massachusetts, was born in 1827 at Hingham, Massachusetts, the son of Martin Lincoln Leavitt, and began working in the early 1870s on a continuous <b>cancelling</b> <b>machine</b> [...] - [...] one that could mechanically sort and stamp envelopes. The postage stamp itself was a relatively new invention, introduced in the U.S. in 1847, and {{within a couple of}} decades the volume of U.S. mail began overwhelming hand cancelling, the only practical method of cancelling each stamp so it could not be reused.|$|E
50|$|The US Post Office Department started {{experiments}} with fluorescent compounds {{in the early}} 1960s. An 8 c air mail stamp issued in 1963 was the first stamp printed for trials with new <b>cancelling</b> <b>machines.</b> The 5 c City Delivery issue of 1963 was the first commemorative issue produced with tagging.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974, Herbert H. Harrington, then {{president}} of the club, wrote to several members of Congress to object to the removal of town names from canceled postage due to the introduction by the United States Postal Service of automated sorting and <b>canceling</b> <b>machines,</b> which he said were, [...] "taking the romance out of post marks." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1919, Pitney was {{introduced}} to Walter Bowes, an industrialist who had success marketing a Post Office stamp <b>canceling</b> <b>machine.</b> In April 1920, the Pitney-Bowes Postage Meter Company was formed.

5000|$|For {{the third}} time in a row, the {{corporate}} powers behind Walt Disney Properties have once again pressured promoter Live Nation into <b>cancelling</b> <b>Machine</b> Head‘s performance at a House of Blues venue on Disney property, this time the December 4th show in Orlando, FL, say the band in a statement: “While no one is willing to provide evidence that would prove unfavorable to Disney, sources close to events have suggested that Machine Head remains on a “banned list”, and while Dethklok, All That Remains and Black Dahlia Murder will still be allowed to play, the corporate powers at Disney have refused to allow Machine Head to perform." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{awarding}} Leavitt's new machine a {{gold medal}} at its 1881 exhibition, the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association noted that Leavitt's subsequent improvements on his original patent had perfected the earlier postal card <b>cancelling</b> <b>machine,</b> [...] "allowing letters of large or small size, either thick or thin, to be operated on to perfection." [...] A number of improvements, including a feeder box, a system of double rollers and a movable impression shaft meant that Leavitt's new invention {{could be used for}} all manners of letters, instead of for just a standard-sized card. [...] "The machine works to perfection," [...] the judges noted, [...] "and saves a great deal of labor." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1907, the {{remainder}} of the stamps of Labuan were overprinted [...] "STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.", some with new denominations, and in 1910 new large-format stamps appeared with values of $25 and $500 (although available for postage, their more usual use was fiscal). George V replaced his father on stamps beginning in 1912, reusing the frames and replacing only the vignettes. These stamps were overprinted in 1922 to mark the Malaya-Borneo Exhibition. The Straits Settlements also joined in the Silver Jubilee for George V in 1935. The last issue of the Straits Settlements was for George VI beginning in 1937. The first <b>cancelling</b> <b>machine</b> was supplied in 1914, probably a Robertson machine from New Zealand.|$|E
5000|$|Following the Armistice on 11 November 1918 the Polish {{authorities}} {{set to work}} to organise {{a postal}} service. Instructions were issued to temporarily use existing stamps and modify or replace <b>cancelling</b> <b>machines</b> with Polish place names.

50|$|Green was {{a member}} of the New York State Senate (38th D.) from 1901 to 1904, sitting in the 124th, 125th, 126th and 127th New York State Legislatures. On September 19, 1903, Green was arrested for {{conspiracy}} in connection with the sale of time-recording clocks and <b>cancelling</b> <b>machines</b> (supplied by the Doremus Machine Co.) to the Post Office. After many delays, he was tried in February 1906 in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia; and was acquitted.|$|R
50|$|A machine {{postmark}} or machine cancellation is a postmark or cancellation on {{mail that}} is applied by a mechanical device {{rather than with}} the use of a handstamp. Nearly all machine-cancellation devices apply both postmark and cancellation simultaneously. While some mail is <b>cancelled</b> using handstamps, <b>machine</b> cancellation is ubiquitous, and in the industrialized nations the vast majority of mail is <b>cancelled</b> by <b>machine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Leavitt's initial models [...] "had serious defects which {{rendered}} its use impracticable", noted a later U.S. Patent Court {{decision of}} 1901. Following Howard's work, {{the machine was}} taken to a Boston post office in 1883, where it was used to sort letters for several hours each day, apparently successfully. Howard's improvements on Leavitt's initial machine [...] - [...] including triggers which prevented the deposit of ink on the machine's pressure roll when no envelope was engaged [...] - [...] worked successfully. But Howard's model was shelved and never introduced commercially.Following the tests, Howard tinkered with his version of Leavitt's <b>cancelling</b> <b>machine</b> to make it quieter and easier to use. But Howard's machine was eventually shelved after its testing. Later, when a competing inventor came up with a modified machine (after having studied prints of Howard's model), the U.S. Patent Courts held the machine did not infringe on Leavitt's initial patent. Because Howard had never introduced his variation, the new model was simply a 'failed experiment'.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1881, Daguin {{recorded}} a first patent (#143668). The machine {{appeared in a}} drawing like a sewing machine under which the mail was moved and cancelled. But a sentence in the patent described what the final machine would look like: [...] "a stamping and <b>cancelling</b> <b>machine</b> with an articulated stamp carrier functioning by hand". Machines described in patents #151332 and #151355 recorded on 30 September 1882, completed three times in 1883, were closer to this sentence than the initial drawing. The machine was fixed to the table. The clerk moved a metallic arm whose extremity hold two datestamp carriers. The clerk lowered the arm toward the mail: the gesture permitted the inking of the datestamps thank to an upward roll. A [...] "touching piston" [...] immobilized the piece of mail firmly on the table: a clear postmark could be made in one move and a spring quickly raised the arm upward. Daguin explained that the piston and the spring avoided blur of ink on the letter. However the postal clerk must pay attention to his second hand that moved the mail on the table.|$|E
50|$|In 1919, Pitney {{joined forces}} with Walter Bowes, an {{entrepreneur}} who had achieved prominence in postal circles through his company, the Universal Stamping Machine Company, which manufactured post office <b>canceling</b> <b>machines.</b> In 1920, the two companies merged to create the Pitney-Bowes Postage Meter Company. In 1926, PBPM Co. (as it was then known) merged with Edward Franks' Franking Company of America and was consolidated and renamed as the Franks Universal Postage Company, or {{sometimes referred to as}} The Universal Postage Trust.|$|R
5000|$|The $3 million postal annex {{opened in}} May 1940 with 1,632 postal clerks, {{carriers}} and laborers {{responsible for the}} processing of 2,000,000 pieces of mail per day. The facility, which was kept open 24 hours a day, was equipped with the latest facilities for rapid handling of mail, including conveyors, chutes, weighing <b>machines,</b> <b>cancelling</b> <b>machines,</b> and sorting and facing tables. At {{the time of its}} opening, it was considered [...] "the most modern and efficient" [...] post office in the nation.

50|$|The first {{supercomputer}} using PERCS {{technology was}} intended to be the Blue Waters system, however the high costs and complexity of the system resulted in its contract being <b>canceled.</b> The <b>machine</b> was subsequently delivered by Cray Inc, using a combination of GPUs and CPUs for processing, and a network with reduced global bandwidth capabilities.|$|R
25|$|A 3-cent Washington-head coil stamp (Scott 389) {{issued in}} 1911 is {{commonly}} referred to as the Orangeburg coil. It was printed with the flat-plate press on single-line watermarked paper with vertical, gauge 12, perforations. The Post Office produced only a small batch of these stamps (it would soon switch over to gauge 8½ perforations for coils) and apparently sold them all to the Bell Pharmaceutical Company, which used 3¢ coil stamps to send samples of their products to physicians through the mail. The actual quantity issued remains unknown. The earliest known use on cover is dated April 27, 1911. Due to the quantity of mail, they were put through the first-class <b>canceling</b> <b>machine</b> at Orangeburg, New York and were mailed third-class. Because these stamps were used on third class mail, most were eventually discarded. Owing to its limited and specific usage philatelists were at first unaware of this issue for approximately two years and so very few examples were saved and collected in mint condition, which accounts for their rarity of this issue today. Approximately twelve covers have been certified as genuine by the Philatelic Foundation. The Orangeburg coils are the rarest coils of the Washington-Franklin issues.|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>machine</b> <b>cancelling</b> devices {{like the}} French Daguin machine or the Italian Dani Machine also applied both the [...] "killer" [...] {{and the date}} stamp simultaneously.

40|$|Continued on page 2 About 1970, I had happily re-entered {{the world}} of philately as a world wide {{collector}} and had branched out into collecting and exhibiting topicals. I fell among evil companions who convinced me that anybody who was anybody in philately collected postal history- especially Colorado Postal History. I wasn’t even too sure what postal history was, but they were eager to teach me. Postal history does involve the stamps to a certain degree, but mostly it involves the study of post office locations, postal cancellations (including manuscript <b>cancels</b> and <b>machine</b> <b>cancels)</b> {{as well as any}} other markings on the cover and the contents of the cover. Some collectors even collect “incoming mail ” and covers addressed to important people {{at the time of the}} letter. Often, the collector that focuses in on a very specific local area seeks to secure an example of each cancellation used within that area. The study of postal history requires an interest in and study of the overall history of the local area collected. I have been interested in the history of Colorado since studying it in elementary school. These evil companions tried to impress m...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} {{period of the}} {{issuance}} of postage stamps in the United States a number of patents were issued for <b>cancelling</b> devices or <b>machines</b> that increased (or were purported to increase) the difficulty of washing off and reusing postage stamps.

40|$|Vibration dynamic {{absorber}} is in use {{to reduce}} machinery vibrations. This paper presents a novel idea {{for using the}} mass-spring absorber as an energy harvester. The aim is to tune the absorber to <b>cancel</b> the <b>machine</b> vibration and produce maximum vibration of the absorber mass {{to act as an}} energy harvester. The main vibrating system is damped and assumed as a SDOF. A new frequency is defined called harvesting frequency at which the amplitude of the absorber mass vibration is maximum. It is shown that his frequency is dependent only on the mass ratio of the absorber and independent of the main system damping ratio. The optimal operation of the proposed system is investigated for damping ratio between 0. 1 and 0. 4 and mass ratio between 0. 05 and 4. 5. The absorber succeeds to eliminate completely the main system vibrations at a tuning condition and provides high vibration amplitude at the absorber mass at the new defined harvesting frequency. ...|$|R
50|$|Throughout the {{lifespan}} of The Legend of Zelda series, {{a number}} of titles (including main series titles as well as re-releases and spin-offs) in varying states of completeness have had their releases cancelled. Perhaps the earliest of these was Gottlieb's The Legend of Zelda Pinball <b>Machine</b> (<b>cancelled</b> 1993). After securing a license from Nintendo to produce two Nintendo-franchise-based pinball machines, pinball designer Jon Norris was tasked with designing the table. Before it was completed, Gottlieb decided to repurpose the game with an American Gladiators theme. Licensing for this version ultimately fell through and the game was released as simply Gladiators (November 1993).|$|R
