50|$|Ballooning: Prolonged {{operation}} under excessive loading, very abrupt {{application of}} load, or operating a torque converter {{at very high}} RPM may cause {{the shape of the}} converters housing to be physically distorted due to internal pressure and/or the stress imposed by inertia. Under extreme conditions, ballooning will cause the <b>converter</b> <b>housing</b> to rupture, resulting in the violent dispersal of hot oil and metal fragments over a wide area.|$|E
50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the impeller inside the torque converter, the pump is typically a gear pump mounted between the torque converter and the planetary gearset. It draws transmission fluid from a sump and pressurizes it, which is needed for transmission components to operate. The input for the pump is connected to the torque <b>converter</b> <b>housing,</b> which in turn is bolted to the engine's flexplate, so the pump provides pressure whenever the engine is running and there is enough transmission fluid, but the disadvantage is that when the engine is not running, no oil pressure is available to operate the main components of the transmission, and is thus impossible to push-start a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission. Early automatic transmissions also had a rear pump for towing purposes, ensuring the lubrication of the rear-end components.|$|E

5000|$|It had a 1-C+C-1 wheel {{arrangement}} in two half-frames, connected in the center. Each frame {{had a pair}} of three phase AC induction motors driving a jackshaft through gearing and a spring drive; side rods then drove the wheels. Three phase power for the 4 massive motors was supplied from the single phase overhead supply via a large rotary <b>converter</b> <b>housed</b> {{in the body of the}} locomotive. Combined rated output of the motors was , but the converter could only supply a short term [...] or a continuous [...] With three-phase induction motors there was no way to control the speed of the motors; changing the wiring of the motor poles allowed for two speed settings, 10.3 and 20.6 mph, which were considered enough to drag heavy freight trains up and down steep grades.|$|R
40|$|The main {{instrumentation}} platform {{consisted of}} eddy correlation sensors {{mounted on a}} scaffold tower at a height of 4. 2 m above the peat surface. The sensors were attached to a boom assembly which could be rotated into the prevailing winds. The boom assembly was mounted on a movable sled which, when extended, allowed sensors {{to be up to}} 2 m away from the scaffolding structure to minimize flow distortion. When retracted, the sensors could easily be installed, serviced or rotated. An electronic level with linear actuators allowed the sensors to be remotely levelled once the sled was extended. Two instrument arrays were installed. A primary (fast-response) array consisted of a three-dimensional sonic anemometer, a methane sensor (tunable diode laser spectrometer), a carbon dioxide/water vapor sensor, a fine wire thermocouple and a backup one-dimensional sonic anemometer. The secondary array consisted of a one-dimensional sonic anemometer, a fine wire thermocouple and a Krypton hygrometer. Descriptions of these sensors may be found in other reports (e. g., Verma; Suyker and Verma). Slow-response sensors provided supporting measurements including mean air temperature and humidity, mean horizontal windspeed and direction, incoming and reflected solar radiation, net radiation, incoming and reflected photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil heat flux, peat temperature, water-table elevation and precipitation. A data acquisition system (consisting of an IBM compatible microcomputer, amplifiers and a 16 bit analog-to-digital <b>converter),</b> <b>housed</b> in a small trailer, was used to record the fast response signals. These signals were low-pass filtered (using 8 -pole Butterworth active filters with a 12. 5 Hz cutoff frequency) and sampled at 25 Hz. Slow-response signals were sampled every 5 s using a network of CR 21 X (Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan Utah) data loggers installed in the fen. All signals were averaged over 30 -minute periods (runs) ...|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{its unique}} {{operating}} characteristics, Turboglide {{did not require}} large changes in engine RPM even with very large differences in car speed or desired engine output. In fact, accelerating from rest, the engine speed would remain nearly constant (with no movement of the accelerator), even as the vehicle accelerated. The actual RPM would {{be a function of}} the pressure applied to the accelerator. One interesting effect during acceleration was the [...] "audio" [...] transition from the first gear turbine (occurring about 2 seconds after takeoff with moderate throttle), then progressing through the remaining 2 turbines which were not so audible (A similar audio effect occurs with a stepped 3-speed automatic... with the first gear having a characteristic whine).At full throttle, Turboglide will maintain the engine RPM within a narrow (~400 rpm) span of speed around 3500-4000 rpm where the best engine output is maintained, and the car will accelerate with a strong [...] "slingshot effect" [...] to catch up as the ratios drop imperceptibly as the car speed increases along the road. The effect is very similar to that of a jet aircraft during the take-off phase, since the engine maintains a strong high speed and the car accelerates, smoothly and strongly, from rest to maximum. In the normal light traffic driving, the Turboglide automatically selects the highest (namely the lowest numerically) practical ratio and the engine speeds run in the 1000-2500 rpm range, saving fuel and improving the throttle response of the car to the small pedal motions. Turboglide also offered a 'Grade Retarder' range for providing engine braking when necessary, a driving condition which could absorb close to [...] of power above to what was available via the engine compression, by counter-rotating the turbines in the converter and soaking up the vehicle energy by agitating the oil inside the <b>converter</b> <b>housing.</b> No low range was provided with Turboglide, as in the Drive range the ratio was always automatically and perfectly matched to the requirements of the operator (all ranges being always engaged, low and intermediate would freewheel on the 'sprag-clutches' as needed), and with the Grade Retarder providing a very efficient engine brake.|$|E
40|$|The {{general-purpose}} {{heat source}} provides power for space missions by transmitting {{the heat of}} {sup 238 }Pu decay to an array of thermoelectric elements in a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG). Because {{the potential for a}} launch abort or return from orbit exists for any space mission, the heat source response to credible accident scenarios is being evaluated. This test was designed to provide information on the response of a loaded RTG to impact by a fragment similar to the type of fragment produced by breakup of the spacecraft propulsion module system. The results of this test indicated that impact by a thin aluminum fragment traveling at 306 m/s may result in significant damage to the <b>converter</b> <b>housing,</b> failure of one fueled clad, and release of a small quantity of fuel...|$|E

The main objective {{of this paper is to}} create a smart dc micro-grid capable of 100 % autonomous zero net electric energy in the cluster of buildings to facilitate a low-carbon sustainable electricity supply system under considerations of urban and rural scenarios. The propose model comprises of house clusters with an autonomous communication developed for the residential area, taking the consideration of stochastic behavior of wind and solar irradiation. Voltage droop and Slope compensation peak current mode control technique for the synchronous bidirectional boost converters is employed for the energy storage systems (ESSs). The bidirectional <b>converter</b> stage for <b>house</b> clusters plays a pivotal role in standalone operation. In case a battery pack is laid off from any house cluster, the dc bus voltage still be stabilized due to the proximity bidirectional converter stages of other house clusters or community bank. The houses in the cluster comprise of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), solar photo voltaic (PV), battery bank and variable load. The proposed model is simulated on MATLAB/Simulink environment and suffices the real time environment...|$|R
