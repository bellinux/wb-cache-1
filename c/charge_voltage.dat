At optical and {{infrared}} wavelengths it can refer to a variety of imaging device types, but in common usage it refers to two-dimensional devices that are sensitive in the infrared spectrum. Devices sensitive in other spectra are usually referred to by other terms, such as CCD (charge-coupled device) and CMOS image sensor in the visible spectrum. FPAs operate by detecting photons at particular wavelengths and then generating an electrical <b>charge,</b> <b>voltage,</b> or resistance in relation to the number of photons detected at each pixel. This <b>charge,</b> <b>voltage,</b> or resistance is then measured, digitized, and used to construct an image of the object, scene, or phenomenon that emitted the photons.|$|E

This limits the overall efficiency of the Wind Machine to 20 %. This study proposed to design and develop a Buck Boost Controller for the effective utilization of the wind machine. By implementing a controller based Buck Boost converter, the voltage produced at the lower wind speeds can also be utilized effectively by boosting it to the rated <b>charging</b> <b>voltage</b> of the battery. Also {{if the wind}} speed is high (> 14 m/s), the DC output voltage will increase to more than 65 V.

40|$|Klystron rf {{stability}} in the linac of ATF, Accelerator Test Facility at KEK, is important to make beam injection into the damping ring stable. The current pulse-to-pulse fluctuation of the output rf is 0. 4 % peak-to-peak in the amplitude and 1. 5 degree in the phase. The linac beam energy is correlated with rf amplitude fluctuation directly. In order to make more stable beam injection, storage and extraction in the damping ring, pulse-to-pulse jitter of injected beam energy should be reduced to half of it. By the analysis of rf fluctuation, the amplitude and the phase jitter are correlated with a <b>charging</b> <b>voltage</b> of the modulator. The <b>charged</b> <b>voltage</b> of the modulator is also correlated with the slope of charging rise cycle. The peak of the charging waveform slope which is a few ms in advance of a deQ trigger control gives a possibility of a feedforward to stabilize the <b>charged</b> <b>voltage.</b> We developed a new deQ circuit with a feedforward function which reduces a <b>charged</b> <b>voltage</b> fluctuation into about a half of it.

5000|$|The {{difficulty}} in constructing high-quality, high-resolution FPAs {{derives from the}} materials used. Whereas visible imagers such as CCD and CMOS image sensors are fabricated from silicon, using mature and well-understood processes, IR sensors must be fabricated from other, more exotic materials because silicon is sensitive only in the visible and near-IR spectra. Infrared-sensitive materials commonly used in IR detector arrays include mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe, [...] "MerCad", or [...] "MerCadTel"), indium antimonide (InSb, pronounced [...] "Inns-Bee"), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs, pronounced [...] "Inn-Gas"), and vanadium(V) oxide (VOx, pronounced [...] "Vox"). A variety of lead salts can also be used, but are less common today. None of these materials can be grown into crystals anywhere near the size of modern silicon crystals, nor do the resulting wafers have nearly the uniformity of silicon. Furthermore, the materials used to construct arrays of IR-sensitive pixels cannot be used to construct the electronics needed to transport the resulting <b>charge,</b> <b>voltage,</b> or resistance of each pixel to the measurement circuitry. This set of functions is implemented on a chip called the multiplexer, or readout integrated circuits (ROIC), and is typically fabricated in silicon using standard CMOS processes. The detector array is then hybridized or bonded to the ROIC, typically using indium bump-bonding, and the resulting assembly is called an FPA.|$|E

The widely used energy storage in {{photovoltaic}} system applications is the lead-acid battery and the knowledge of its state-of-charge (SOC) is important in effecting efficient control and energy management. However, SOC cannot be measured while the battery is connected to the system. This study adjusts and validates two estimation models: battery state-of-charge model using ampere-hour counting method and battery <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> model. For the battery state-of-charge model, the SOC is estimated by integrating the charge/discharge current over time while the battery <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> characteristic response is modelled by using the equation-fit method which expresses the battery <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> variations by a 5 th order polynomial in terms of the state-of-charge and current. These models are realized using the MATLAB program.

In this work, an optical emission from eccentric electrode-type PAED reactor operated by 0. 3 and 0. 5 kJ pulsed power supplies are experimentally investigated.

40|$|The AMRL flyer {{sensitivity}} test apparatus (FSTA) uses the electric gun technique to accelerate 50 pm thick plastic flyer plates of about 3. 5 mm in diameter to high velocity. Impacting high explosives with the flyer plates generates short duration shock pulses with sufficient energy to cause ignition.

40|$|Frequency {{characteristics}} and {{their dependence on}} <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> for a packed electric double layer capacitor (EDLC), which consists {{of a series of}} connected EDLC cells, are characterized and modeled based on small ac signal analysis. The results indicate that rated capacitance of a packed EDLC is valid only at frequencies lower than 0. 01 Hz at the rated <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> but the capacitance is lower for frequencies higher than 0. 01 Hz and for lower charge voltages. A conventional simple RC-equivalent circuit, consisting of a capacitor and a resistance in series, is inadequate for expressing EDLC frequency characteristics; therefore, a second-order RC equivalent circuit is used as a model for a packed EDLC. The <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> dependency in the frequency characteristics of packed EDLC is evaluated, based on this equivalent circuit.

The results indicated that all the AlCrN coatings exhibited a dense columnar microstructure. Higher <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> could facilitate a denser coating microstructure. As the <b>charge</b> <b>voltage</b> increased up to 450 V or higher, the microvoids along the column boundaries disappeared and the coatings became fully dense. The main phase in the AlCrN coatings was the c-(Al, Cr) N solid solution phase with NaCl-type phase structure.
