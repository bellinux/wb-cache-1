[...] And on his brest a bloodie crosse he bore, [...] The deare remembrance of his dying Lord, [...] For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore, [...] And dead, as living ever, him ador'd: [...] Upon his shield the like was also scor'd, [...] For soveraine hope, which in his helpe he had, [...] Right faithfull true he was in deede and word; [...] But of his cheere[120] did seeme too solemne sad; [...] Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad.[121] ...|$|E

50|$|Dijon {{was last}} used in 1984, {{and by then}} {{turbo-charged}} engines were almost ubiquitous, save the Tyrrell team who were still using the Cosworth V8 engine. The international motorsports governing body at the time, FISA, had instituted a policy of long-term contracts with only one circuit per Grand Prix. The choice was between Dijon and Ricard- the small Prenois circuit had cars lapping in the 1 minute 1 second range, and Ricard was the main testing facility for Formula One at the time. So it was Ricard that was chosen, and it hosted the race from 1985-1990. From 1986 onwards Formula One used a shortened version of the circuit, after Elio de Angelis's fatal crash at the fast Verriere bends. De Angelis was not injured by the crash, however his car caught fire {{and there were no}} marshals to help him as it was a test session, and he died of smoke inhalation in hospital the next day. These 2 fast corners and the whole top section of the circuit was not used for the last 5 races. Prost won the final 3 races there, the 1988 one being a particularly dramatic win; he overtook his teammate Ayrton Senna at the <b>Curbe</b> de Signes {{at the end of the}} ultra fast Mistral Straight and held onto the lead all the way to the finish, and the 1990 (by which time turbo-charged engines had been banned) event was led for more than 60 laps by Italian Ivan Capelli and Brazilian Maurício Gugelmin in underfunded, Adrian Newey designed Leyton-House cars - 2 cars that had failed to qualify at the previous event in Mexico. Prost, now driving for Ferrari after driving for McLaren from 1984-1989, made a late-race charge and passed Capelli to take the victory; Gugelmin had retired earlier.|$|E

During the period of the flat level of egg laying <b>curbe</b> (35 – 49 weeks) from these hens weekly were harvested eggs which were after that grouped related to their weight in the small (50 – 57 g), medium (58 – 62 g) and big (63 – 68 g) eggs categories and then were incubated. Incubation indexes followed were the fecundity, dead embrios and hatching percent. The highest level of fecundity was realised earlier in the big eggs category and then decrease gradual. Dead embryos percent has higher values {{during the first week of}} incubation. In the next two weeks decreases, but as a fact of a bad incubation regime. For the big and small eggs the dead embryos percent is higher...|$|E

There {{has been no}} corresponding increase in Swedish trade with the United States. This serves as motivation for our interest in price setting/invoicing in a third currency. We investigate the role of pricing in the importers', exporter's or a third currency in a simple model with pre-set prices. The firm of study is a risk neutral monopolist exporter who faces a linear demand <b>curbe.</b> Expected prices, quantities and profits depend on the price setting currency chosen. Also the curvature of realised profits {{as a function of}} exchange rate surprises depends on the price setting currency chosen. In an extension we discuss the role of competition from a third country in a model of Bertrand competition in differentiated goods. Invoicing; exchange rate fluctuations; pricing of exports...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} and pervasive presence of state-owned enterprises represented a substantial peculiarity of Italian capitalism {{for a long}} time, from the 1930 s {{to the end of}} the 20 th century. Historiography stressed the relevance of state-owned enterprises for the development of capital-intensive industries but also argued that they might in some way have <b>curbe</b> dthe growth of the private sector of the economy. Recent research gave a detailed map of the extension of the major Italian state-owned groups. However, their links with private companies and, more generally, their role in the Italian corporate network remain largely unexplored. This paper explores this subject by using the interlocking directorates technique. In particular, this paper assesses Chiesi's thesis according to which in the mid- 1970 s the Italian corporate newtork was marked by the presence of two centres, one state-owned and the other private, which were clearly distinct one from the other. The analysis is based on the database Imita. db - which contains data on more than 300, 000 Italian joint-stock companies - and focuses on the years 1972 and 1983. For both benchmark years the paper presents several indicators of network analysis and a prosopographic research. The paper argues that - contrary to the results obtained by Chiesi using a different sample - in 1972 the Italian corporate network was very cohesive and characterized by the presence of one large centre, comprising both the major private and state-owned companies. However, in 1983 a substantial change had occurred. The cohesion of the system had sharply decreased and state-owned enterprises had disappeared from its centre. Now the structure of the Italian corporate network seemed more in line with Chiesi's argument, with the presence of two distinct centres: one larger and private and the other smaller and state-owned, clearly disconnected one from the other...|$|E
