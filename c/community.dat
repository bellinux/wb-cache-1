40|$|In this paper, we {{divide the}} <b>communities</b> in Central China into four groups, namely {{ecological}} high-poverty <b>communities,</b> non-ecological high-poverty <b>communities,</b> sustainable <b>communities</b> and non-ecological low-poverty <b>communities.</b> We use 2000 and 2006 data for 498 counties to conduct analysis and comparison between sustainable and unsustainable <b>communities</b> {{in order to}} define determinants of the development pathways to sustainable <b>communities.</b> The comparison of the variable means between the groups of ecological high-poverty <b>communities</b> and non-ecological high-poverty <b>communities</b> in 2006 indicates {{that there is no}} significant difference in the dimensions related to economy, society and environment, with the exception of average output value per industrial enterprise. The non-ecological low-poverty <b>communities</b> are more likely to have a higher proportion of secondary industry, higher total industrial output value, higher average output value per industrial enterprise and higher intensity of infrastructure construction, compared to the sustainable <b>communities.</b> The factors that determine whether the <b>communities</b> will choose the pathway to sustainable <b>communities</b> are found to be landscape, social conditions of secondary industry and agriculture and economic development level. Hence, the policies that aim at promoting sustainability for the unsustainable <b>communities</b> will have to focus on different strategies and actions for non-ecological high-poverty and non-ecological low-poverty <b>communities...</b>|$|R
