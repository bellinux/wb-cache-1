40|$|This text {{is focused}} on the {{presentation}} of jihad in Czech newspapers over the course of 10 years after September 11 th, 2001 in three periods – the first period runs from September 11 th, 2001 to September 11 th, 2002, followed by the years 2006 – 2007 and 2010 – 2011. The main aim of this work is to compare two different political journals (Lidové Noviny and Právo) and find out if there are some similarities or differences in constructing representations of Islam through the term jihad. This has been done in two steps. In the first step, the term jihad is analyzed throughout the articles. In the second step, two different theories (<b>clash</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilization</b> and multiculturalism), which might be implicitly involved in media discourse, are used for further analysis of these articles. The methodology combines two approaches – qualitative and quantitative content analyses. Eight different frames of jihad are defined through qualitative analysis: (1) duty, (2) defence/revenge, (3) holy war, (4) undefined, (5) jihad of sword, (6) “self-improvement”, (7) semantic shift of jihad and (8) global jihad. The most interesting is the seventh category, which uses the term out of its religious meaning, as synonymous with a fight, chaos, aggression etc. Furthermore, this work will show that left-wing and right-wing journals don’t fulfill the expectations corresponding to their political rhetoric. Articles from left-wing journals contain much more signs <b>of</b> the <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilization</b> than they do of multiculturalism. Thus, the main result is that the political dichotomy between the right-wing and left-wing is disappearing in the Czech Republic...|$|R

Through an analysis of Karakoç’s writing, the article situates post–WWII era Islamist thought in Turkey in relation to politics of the Cold War competition, global intellectual trends, and decolonization movements. In this context, the article focuses on the Islamist appropriation of Arnold Toynbee’s ideas on civilizational relations in world history and how Toynbee’s writings were utilized in critiques of modernization theory and westernization movements in postcolonial Muslim societies, {{as well as the}} Cold War superpower competition in world politics.

In fact, this study goes intentionally and consciously against the basic assumptions that attempted to present MENA as an “Arab Land” or “Islamic World”. MENA has witnessed the rising of the earliest Mediterranean civilizations that formed what is known now as the “western civilization”. Hence, this study proposes a challenging idea {{about the relationship between}} Islam and MENA polities. This idea is based on the simple fact that Islam is an Araba cultural product, that is not adapted to MENA polities. In other words, this study is proposing a new view that can be summarized as MENA’s <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilization.</b> Moreover, {{the findings of this study}} proposes that Islam is a collapsing paradigm and the future of MENA is not moving according to an Islamic agenda.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis investigates why Iraq's Sunnis resorted to violent collective action, rather than non-violent political action, following Saddam's overthrow. Using social movement theory, I argue that decreasing political opportunity, existing mobilizing structures with violent repertoires, and effective framing {{of the opposition}} as kufr (non-Muslim) explain the emergence of Iraq's Sunni insurgency. I posit that Sunnis felt a profound grievance in the decreased political opportunity following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Furthermore, mobilization nearly always utilizes existing networks and adapts {{the characteristics of the}} physical spaces and organizational structures from which the movement emerges. I argue that the disbanded military and militant Islamist networks comprised the bulk of the first insurgent groups, and that these groups used their existing repertoires to shape Iraq's political environment. I then trace the frames used throughout the conflict, illustrating that the common theme is opposition to rule by kufr - whether it be Coalition nations or Iraqi Shi'a - and this provides a concrete target for the insurgency. Examined collectively, these three factors provide a sufficient explanation for the Sunni insurgents' turn to violence to address their political grievances. This argument stands in constrast to the <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> <b>civilization</b> and "Cosmic War" arguments, which offer insufficient explanations...|$|R
