25|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to reduce the {{concentration}} of inclusions. In order to reduce oxide formation the metal can be melted with a flux, in a vacuum, or in an inert atmosphere. Other ingredients can be added to the mixture to cause the dross to float to the top where it can be skimmed off before the metal is poured into the mold. If this is not practical, then a special ladle that pours the metal from the bottom can be used. Another option is to install <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> into the gating system. Otherwise swirl gates can be formed which swirl the liquid metal as it is poured in, forcing the lighter inclusions to the center and keeping them out of the casting. If some of the dross or slag is folded into the molten metal then it becomes an entrainment defect.|$|E

50|$|One {{improvement}} over the standard design of ceramic vacuum filter is to use serialized pore size distributions of non-fibrous porous <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters.</b> The porosity {{of this type of}} ceramic can be varied from 20% to 60% by volume, which allows a low-pressure drop of liquid and gas flow. Custom sizes from 1 mm diameter/0.5 mm bore of porous <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> are available for a range of designs. A non-fibrous porous ceramic filter is more resistant in alkaline and acidic conditions compared to fibrous <b>ceramic</b> <b>filters.</b> Thus, it has a longer service life as it has good wearing and erosion resistance as well as being able to withstand high temperatures.|$|E

50|$|A vacuum <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> is {{designed}} to separate liquids from solids for dewatering purposes. The device consists of a rotator, slurry tank, <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> plate, distributor, discharge scraper, cleaning device, frame, agitating device, pipe system, vacuum system, automatic acid dosing system, automatic lubricating system, valve and discharge chute. The operation and construction principle of vacuum <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> resemble those of a conventional disc filter, but the filter medium {{is replaced by a}} finely porous ceramic disc. The disc material is inert, has a long operational life and is resistant to almost all chemicals.

50|$|After {{couple of}} years in service the radio might become {{insensitive}} to narrow-band FM signals {{as it has been}} reported by several users.

Since design of the intermediate frequency path is similar to other VX-series radios, the failure mode is common with other models. The original design skips the DC blocking capacitors in the output of the filter which are otherwise recommended by the component manufacturer.

The results showed that the <b>ceramic</b> <b>filter</b> has a critical role in the reduction of the velocity and surface turbulence of the liquid metal and hence the creation of double oxide film defects in the naturally-pressurised running system. The reduction in the melt velocity was measured to be about 50 %.

50|$|Whilst {{the vacuum}} ceramic filter {{has proved to}} be a great innovation, there are still some {{limitations}} involved when operating the equipment. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>filters</b> exhibit large fluctuations in the recoiling washing pressure (0.05~0.35 MPa).
