2500|$|Any set can {{be given}} the <b>cocountable</b> topology, in which a set is defined as open if it is either empty or its {{complement}} is countable. [...] When the set is uncountable, this topology serves as a counterexample in many situations.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cocountable</b> {{topology}} (also {{called the}} [...] "countable complement topology") on any set X {{consists of the}} empty set and all <b>cocountable</b> subsets of X.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} a space that is not {{sequential}} is the <b>cocountable</b> topology on an uncountable set. Every convergent sequence in such a space is eventually constant, hence every set is sequentially open. But the <b>cocountable</b> topology is not discrete. In fact, {{one could say that}} the <b>cocountable</b> topology on an uncountable set is [...] "sequentially discrete".|$|E
50|$|The <b>cocountable</b> {{topology}} on a countable set is the discrete topology. The <b>cocountable</b> topology on an uncountable set is hyperconnected, thus connected, locally {{connected and}} pseudocompact, but neither weakly countably compact nor countably metacompact, hence not compact.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cocountable</b> {{topology}} or countable complement topology on any set X {{consists of}} the empty set and all <b>cocountable</b> subsets of X, that is all sets whose complement in X is countable. It follows that the only closed subsets are X and the countable subsets of X.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a <b>cocountable</b> {{subset of}} a set X is a subset Y whose {{complement}} in X is a countable set. In other words, Y contains all but countably many elements of X. While the rational numbers are a countable subset of the reals, for example, the irrational numbers are a <b>cocountable</b> subset of the reals. If the complement is finite, then one says Y is cofinite.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cocountable</b> {{extension}} topology is the topology on {{the real}} line generated by the union of the usual Euclidean topology and the <b>cocountable</b> topology. Sets are open in this topology {{if and only if}} they are of the form U \ A where U is open in the Euclidean topology and A is countable. This space is completely Hausdorff and Urysohn, but not regular (and thus not Tychonoff).|$|E
5000|$|Every set X {{with the}} <b>cocountable</b> {{topology}} is Lindelöf, since every nonempty open set omits only countably many points of X. It is also T1, as all singletons are closed.|$|E

5000|$|Referring to {{a subset}} of an {{uncountable}} set, [...] "almost all" [...] is sometimes used to mean all the elements except for a countable set" [...] (that is, it is a <b>cocountable</b> subset).|$|E
50|$|In {{discrete}} mathematics, {{one uses}} the term almost all to mean cofinite (all but finitely many), <b>cocountable</b> (all but countably many), for sufficiently large numbers, or, sometimes, asymptotically almost surely. The concept is particularly important {{in the study of}} random graphs.|$|E
50|$|The set of all subsets of X {{that are}} either {{countable}} or <b>cocountable</b> forms a σ-algebra, i.e., it is closed under the operations of countable unions, countable intersections, and complementation. This σ-algebra is the countable-cocountable algebra on X. It is the smallest σ-algebra containing every singleton set.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a {{cofinite}} {{subset of}} a set X is a subset A whose complement in X is a finite set. In other words, A contains all but finitely many elements of X. If the complement is not finite, but it is countable, then one says the set is <b>cocountable.</b>|$|E
50|$|If X is an {{uncountable}} set, any two open sets intersect, {{hence the}} space is not Hausdorff. However, in the <b>cocountable</b> topology all convergent sequences are eventually constant, so limits are unique. Since compact sets in X are finite subsets, all compact subsets are closed, another condition usually related to Hausdorff separation axiom.|$|E
40|$|We study {{conditions}} on automorphisms of Boolean algebras {{of the form}} P(λ) /I_κ (where λ is an uncountable cardinal and I_κ is the ideal of sets of cardinality less than κ) which allow one to conclude that a given automorphism is trivial. We show (among other things) that every cardinality-preserving automorphism of P(2 ^κ) /I_κ^+ which is trivial on all sets of cardinality κ^+ is trivial, and that MA_ℵ_ 1 implies that every automorphism of P(R) /Fin is trivial on a <b>cocountable</b> set.

40|$|We {{show that}} every {{injective}} homological ring epimorphism f:R [...] > S where S_R has flat dimension at most one {{gives rise to}} a 1 -cotilting R-module and we give sufficient conditions under which the converse holds true. Specializing to the case of a valuation domain R, we illustrate a bijective correspondence between equivalence classes of injective homological ring epimorphisms originating in R and cotilting classes of certain type and in turn, a bijection with a class of smashing localizing subcategories of the derived category of R. Moreover, we obtain that every cotilting class over a valuation domain is a Tor-orthogonal class, hence it is of <b>cocountable</b> type even though in general cotilting classes are not of cofinite type...|$|E
40|$|It is {{a welcome}} fact that recent popular books on {{mathematics}} cover not just elementary topics, {{but some of the}} more advanced ones, such as the Riemann hypothesis, the Hilbert problems, and the million-dollar problems. Leonard Wapner chose the Banach-Tarski paradox (BTP) to write about. An interesting choice. It is one of the (very) few great mathematical results that can be fully understood by anyone: a solid ball can be split into a finite number of parts that can be rearranged into a similar decomposition of two balls, both as large as the original. A similar proof shows that any two bodies in 3 -space are likewise equidecomposable, assuming they are bounded and both have nonempty interior (this gives the title of the book). This result, which appeared in the 1924 volume of Fundamenta Mathematicæ, was preceded in 1914 by the following result of Hausdorff. There is a <b>cocountable</b> subset of S 2 that can be decomposed as A ∪ B ∪ C such that A, B, C, and A ∪ B are all congruent. As it already has the character of saying 1 = 2 and as the proof of BTP leans heavily on its proof, the latter could perhaps be called the Hausdorff-Banach-Tarski paradox...|$|E
40|$|F be {{a family}} of subspaces of X. We say that X is jointly metrizable on F, or that X is F-metrizable, {{if there is a}} metric d on the set X such that d metrizes all subspaces of X which are in F, that is, the {{restriction}} of d to A generates the subspace topology on A, for each A ∈ F. 1 Example: Take an arbitrary non-metrizable space X, and let d be the standard discrete metric on X, that is, d(x, y) = 1, for any distinct points x, y of X. Then d doesn’t metrize the space X, since X is not metrizable, but d obviously metrizes every discrete subspace of X. Thus, every topological space X is jointly metrizable on all discrete subspaces of X. 2 Proposition: Suppose that γ = {Xα: α ∈ A} is a disjoint family of metrizable subspaces of a space X. Then X is jointly metrizable on γ. Proof. For each α ∈ A, fix a metric dα on the subspace Xα which generates the topology of this subspace. We may assume that dα(x, y) ≤ 1, for any distinct x, y ∈ Xα. Now we define a metric d on X as follows: d(x, y) = dα(x, y) if x, y ∈ Xα for some α ∈ A; otherwise, we put d(x, y) = 1 if x and y are distinct. Clearly, d is a metric on X which metrizes every subspace Xα in γ. 3 Compactly Metrizable Spaces Definition. We say that a topological space X is compactly metrizable, or that X is jointly metrizable on compacta, if X is jointly metrizable on the family of all compact subspaces of X. The following result is obvious. Proposition. Every subspace of a compactly metrizable space is compactly metrizable. 4 Proposition. Any compactly metrizable space X is a T 1 -space. Proof. Since every compact subspace of X is metrizable, every compact subspace of X is closed in X. But every finite space is compact. Hence, X is a T 1 -space. 5 Remark. Not every compactly metrizable space is Hausdorff. Example: Take an uncountable set X with the <b>cocountable</b> topology in which the only closed sets are countable sets and the set X. The space X is not Hausdorff, since any two nonempty open subsets of X have a non-empty intersection. On the other hand, every countable subspace of X is closed in X and discrete. Thus, all compact subspaces of X are discrete. Therefore, X is compactly metrizable...|$|E
