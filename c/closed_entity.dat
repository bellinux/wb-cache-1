40|$|Background {{in music}} psychology. Emotion {{and meaning in}} music can in general be studied in two {{different}} ways. On the one hand, empirical aesthetics (e. g. Berlyne 1971) tries to explain responses to music such as pleasure, preference, or physiological responses (e. g. arousal) by analysing informational properties of the music (complexity, structure, tempo, mode etc.). On the other hand, researchers investigate the function of music and its emotional qualities in everyday life (e. g. Sloboda 2001). Both quantitative and qualitative methods in music psychology try to generate meaning and emotion in music {{at the expense of}} actual, individual experience. Some approaches (e. g. Imberty 1979, 1981), however, try to link musical structures, musical expressivity and psychoanalytical concepts. Background in music philosophy. Phenomenology and postmodern philosophy criticise traditional psychology’s construction of a subject as a <b>closed</b> <b>entity.</b> This concept was deconstructed by e. g. Nietzsche, Heidegger and Derrida, who argued that the separation of any phenomenon from the observer as rational/conscious entity (Kant, Descartes) is a metaphysic construction.

Monelle 1992). Aims.

40|$|The {{household}} is {{a crucial}} focus of both waste and wider environmental policy, being seen as a central site of socio -economic-environmental change, a space in which people may perform their civic responsibilities and where individual and wider imperatives are brought together. Yet policy makers have shown limited appreciation and understanding of what happens inside the home. So in contemporary waste policy, for example, households remain a ‘closed entity’ in which everyday routines and practices remain hidden. Increasingly, though, it is acknowledged by social scientists that the lived experiences of environmental and waste management in the home are significant issues requiring further study, but how we might go about trying to study them is proving a challenging question. Conventional pro-environmental behaviour research has often tended to study behaviours in ways abstracted from the social contexts in which these take place. This has prompted recent research involving repeat in-depth interviews with householders and more ethnographic approaches, the use of reflexive diaries and narrative methodologies. Curiously, however, {{there has been little}} research considering environmental management(s) in the home which has focussed on waste itself. This paper seeks to add to the discussion, by focusing on everyday processes within households, using a qualitative approach of ‘getting in the bin’ of households - that is, an interview approach which takes respondents’ discarded waste as a starting point from which we ask them to discuss the lived experience(s) and activities of everyday life. More broadly by developing insights from what has been termed a ‘realist governmentality’ perspective the paper seeks to offer a more nuanced and finely grained analysis of governing in situ, exploring the extent to which governmental ambitions in relation to waste are accommodated, resisted or [re]worked at the household level. The paper draws illustratively on case studies from a Leverhulme-funded research project based in Kingston-Upon-Thames, an outer London borough in the UK. The approach used a focus on the contents of household waste bins to develop a narrative approach driven by householders centred on stories about pro-environmental practice. The paper will deal with three elements of the research approach: texturing narratives of waste, generating narratives of recycling in practice, and producing narratives of understanding. The outcome is development of a more thoroughgoing understanding of how processes within the home shape waste governance, moving beyond treating the home as a <b>closed</b> <b>entity...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} Western {{classical}} {{music and the}} development of its notational system show that composers have tried to control more and more aspects of their compositions as precisely as possible. Total serialism represents the culmination of compositional control. Given this progressively increasing compositional control, the emergence of chance music, or aleatoric music, in the mid-twentieth century is a significantly interesting phenomenon. In aleatoric music, the composer deliberately incorporates elements of chance in the process of composition and/or in performance. Consequently, aleatoric works challenge the traditional notion of an art work as a <b>closed</b> <b>entity</b> fixed by its author. The philosophical root of aleatoric music can be traced to post structuralism, specifically its critique of the Enlightenment notion of the author as the creator of the meaning of his or her work. Roland Barthes' declaration of "the death of the author" epitomizes the Poststructuralists' position. Distinguishing "Text" from "Work," Barthes maintains that in a "Text," meanings are to be engendered not by the author but by the reader. Barthes conceives aleatoric music {{as an example of the}} "Text," which demands "the birth of the reader. " This essay critically re-examines Barthes' notion of aleatoric music, focusing on the complicated status of the reader in music. The readers of a musical Text can be both performers and listeners. When Barthes' declaration of the birth of the reader is applied to the listener, it becomes problematic, since the listener, unlike the literary reader, does not have direct access to the "Text" but needs to be mediated by the performer. As Carl Dahlhaus has remarked, listeners cannot be exposed to other possible renditions that the performer could have chosen but did not choose, and in this respect, the supposed openness of an aleatoric piece is closed and fixed at the time of performance. In aleatoric music, it is not listeners but only performers who are promoted to the rank of co-author of the works. Finally, this essay explores the reason why Barthes turned to music for the purpose of illustrating his theory of text. What rhetorical role does music play in his articulation of "Work" and "Text"? Precisely because of music's "difference" as a performance art, music history provides the examples of the lowest and the highest moments in Barthes' theory of text, that is, those of Work and Text. If, for Barthes, the institutionalization of the professional performer in music history demonstrates the advent of Work better than literary examples, the performer's supposed dissolution in aleatoric music is more liberating than any literary moments of Text. This is because the figure of music - as performance art-provides Barthes with a reified and bodily "situated" model of the Subject...|$|E
40|$|Seismology is {{the study}} of the {{vibration}} of the Earth. Seismologists pay much attention to the main source of Earth vibration: earthquakes. But also other seismic sources, like mining blasts, ocean storms and windmills, are studied. All these sources induce seismic waves, which can eventually be recorded as ground vibrations. These seismic records contain not only information about the sources, but also about the part of the Earth through which the waves have propagated. This thesis focuses on a main subclass of seismology: seismic imaging. With seismic imaging, seismic records are studied with the aim to unravel the structure and composition of the Earth. Seismic imaging finds its main use in extracting information about the solid Earth that is within our reach. With {{the current state of the}} art, we can only mine minerals from the upper 0. 2 percent. Imaging the deep (i. e., unreachable) Earth finds its main use in hazard assessment. Through imaging the deep Earth, we can better understand the dynamics of our planet, manifested in, amongst others, earthquakes and volcanism. By forecasting how the Earth will reshape, we can sensibly adapt. Seismic characterization of the subsurface also improves our ability to assess the direct impact of earthquakes. A large part of the current deep-Earth images are obtained through tomographic inversion. These images are successful for identifying large-scale structural anomalies, like (remnants of) subducting slabs. However, they lack the resolution to accurately image discontinuities in space. Sharp discontinuities, like the interface between sedimentary and crystalline rock, lead to conversions and reflections of seismic waves. It is those reflections that are most suitable for imaging the discontinuities. The technique developed to do this is called seismic reflection imaging (SRI). Though SRI is considered to be an advanced technique for imaging the subsurface, the dense and wide source (and receiver) distribution requirement thus far limited the use for deep-Earth imaging. Deep-Earth imaging is done primarily with natural sources. Their limited and irregular distribution and their unpredictable occurrence time is inconvenient for SRI. In this thesis we work on a methodology to alleviate the stringent requirement on the source distribution. This methodology is called seismic interferometry (SI). SI is a remapping operation. With SI, the responses from many sources are combined to create the response as if there were a source at a receiver position. The response from this "virtual" source could contain both surface waves and body waves. We apply SI such that especially (reflected) body waves are retrieved, because it are these waves that are used for SRI. When we apply SI to a regularly-spaced array of receivers, we could turn uncontrolled natural sources into a well-organized succession of virtual sources, which is amenable for SRI. The aim of this work is to improve the imaging of the interior of the Earth by the application of body-wave SI to naturally induced seismic data. A prior study focused on the exploration-scale (i. e., the part of the Earth that is being mined). In this thesis, we focus on low-frequency waves (< 2 Hz), which contain especially information about the deep Earth. In Part I we consider applications to earthquake recordings. In Part II we evaluate the retrieval of reflections using microseisms. Part I starts by looking into the global-scale configuration. For this configuration, two seismic stations (or two arrays of stations) may be located anywhere on the globe and reflectors may be located anywhere in depth. We derive and numerically test relations to retrieve the complete response between two stations, using worldwide seismicity. The SI relations are valid for a <b>closed</b> <b>entity</b> for seismic waves, like the Earth is by approximation. The relations do not account for inelastic losses, by which eventually all seismic energy is transformed to heat. Though normally of negligible influence, the SI relations do account for the rotation of the Earth. In practice, the distribution of the larger earthquakes is not wide enough to retrieve complete responses between any two points on the Earth. However, still relevant primary reflections can be retrieved with a limited dense distribution of seismicity, like from the Tohoku (2011) aftershock sequence. Part I proceeds by zooming in to the lithospheric-scale configuration. The lithosphere is the part of the solid Earth where most (seismic) activity takes place. It makes up the crust and the upper part of the mantle. It is this part of the Earth that, broken into plates and fueled by convection in the mantle, undergoes birth (at midoceanic ridges), collisions (resulting in stunning topography) and death (subduction back into the mantle). Inspecting the Earth in depth unveils a part of the history of the lithosphere and gives an indication of the processes still ongoing. Information about the structure of the lithosphere is hidden in the coda of wavefields that arrive due to distant seismicity. We test a few different SI approaches to extract this information. We use synthetic data with similar characteristics as field data recorded during the Laramie broad-band experiment (2000 - 2001). This was an array of seismic stations in Wyoming, USA, to study an suture zone. We evaluate the requirements for obtaining multi-offset reflection responses. These multi-offset reflections are important for obtaining a velocity model. We estimate this model for the subsurface below the Laramie array and we use it to map the extracted reflections to a reflectivity image of the lithosphere. In the remainder of part I, we focus again on the lithospheric scale. This time, we assume that a velocity model is already available through other means. Consequently, only single-offset reflection responses are required to make an image. We use global phases to obtain zero-offset reflection responses. We show the robustness of the method with data from the Hi-CLIMB experiment (2002 - 2005). This was a large and well-sampled seismic array, passing the Himalayas and a significant part of the Tibetan Plateau. The successive application of SRI leads to an image of the Indian-Eurasian Plate collision. The rediscovery of body waves in low-frequency noise (< 1 Hz) opened up the research for Part II of this thesis. The noise are in fact microseisms: Earth vibrations that are indirectly caused by ocean gravity waves. High-amplitude ocean waves are caused when storms, leading to persistent wind fields, cross an ocean. We retrieve reflection responses from body-wave noise using SI approaches similar to the ones used for earthquake recordings. The main difference between applications to noise and (large) earthquake responses is that the origin of large earthquakes is known, whereas the origin of noise is generally not known. Therefore, the main challenge for noise applications is to unravel the noise illumination. For this purpose, we use a well-sampled areal array in Egypt to study the noise illumination in different frequency bands. We only select the noise records with a favorable body-wave content and process them into separate reflection responses, of both the lithosphere and the upper crust. We further evaluate what basin-scale information can be extracted from the retrieved reflections. The wavelengths of the reflections extracted from low-frequency noise are too long to image a sedimentary basin in detail. However, the sharp boundary between the sediments and the underlying crystalline rocks can be delineated. For the same dataset from Egypt, we compare the information that is extracted with SI with the information that is obtained when using two other passive seismic techniques, namely horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio and receiver function. In the appendices we discuss a few spin-off developments from the main research. In Appendix A we work out an alternative SI relation that integrates over midpoints between receiver positions, instead of over sources. Using this relation, reflections can already be retrieved using only a single source. However, a well-sampled array of receivers needs to be available and an additional evaluation needs to be performed. In Appendix B we develop a technique to estimate loss factors from plane-wave transmission responses. The losses are estimated from amplitude ratios, obtained before and after applying autocorrelation. In Appendix C we present a method that was inspired by SI. Crosscorrelations of diffractions from the core-mantle boundary are used to swiftly scan anomalies in the crust and mantle. Finally, in Appendix D we discuss an alternative implementation of SI: SI by multidimensional deconvolution. With this technique the outcome of SI may be improved. However, well-sampled arrays of receivers are required and additional processing needs to be implemented. In this thesis, we show that the application of SI to earthquake recordings is sufficiently mature to yield high-resolution images of the lithosphere. Relations for imaging deeper structures are worked out and modus operandi are thought through. However, the reality check is still to be encountered with field-data applications. Furthermore, we show that the applications of SI to microseisms can be used to yield information about a basin depth. Moreover, we show the great promise of microseism applications for unveiling a lithosphere in depth, using only a few days of noise recordings. The more repetitive character of microseism sources with respect to earthquakes, in fact makes them more amenable for monitoring applications, if their yearly variations and radiation characteristics are well understood.

This activity tends to become morerepresentative because of the position of the largest pension funds. They have divulged, through websites and other media, their investment politics focused on companies with good governance practices, social and environmental responsibility; they have also put to the disposal their first principals and values based on the use of a strategic management directed to social and environmental responsibility. In such case, through a descriptive and exploratory research, this work intends to analyze the concepts and practices of the three largest brazilian pension funds (PREVI, PETROS and FUNCEF), which represent about 46 % of R$ 394, 68 billions, the total of investments done by <b>Closed</b> <b>Entities</b> of Complementary Provident in Brazil. Thus, using a conceptual model characterized by its implicity and wealth of information, a comparative analysis between the contents of websites of the mentioned pension funds is going to be established...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} recover the {{function}} of universal history, which was to place particulars into relation with universals. By the 20 th century universal history was largely discredited because of an idealism that served to lend epistemic coherence to the overwhelming complexity arising from universal history's comprehensive scope. Idealism also attempted to account for history's being "open" [...] for the human ability to transcend circumstance. The paper attempts {{to recover the}}se virtues without the idealism by defining universal history not by its scope {{but rather as a}} scientific method that provides an understanding of any kind of historical process, be it physical, biological or human. While this method is not new, it is in need of a development that offers a more robust historiography and warrant as a liberating historical consciousness. The first section constructs an ontology of process by defining matter as ontic probabilities rather than as <b>closed</b> <b>entities.</b> This is lent warrant in the next section through an appeal to contemporary physical science. The resulting conceptual frame and method is applied to the physical domain of existents, to the biological domain of social being and finally to the human domain of species being. It is then used to account for the emergence of human history's initial stage [...] the Archaic Socio-Economic Formation and for history' stadial trajectory [...] its alternation of evolution and revolution...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the lifeworld of the high-achieving young adolescent. A literature study was undertaken to determine the developmental level of young adolescents and their corresponding needs. The Bio-ecosystemic theory of Bronfenbrenner was used as theoretical basis to explore the level of influence in the life of the young adolescent. The role parental involvement plays in the life-experience and perceptions of young adolescents was also investigated. The results of the study indicated that the environment or lifeworld of young adolescents plays a big role in all the different aspects of their development. Parents, who are the <b>closest</b> <b>entities</b> in their lifeworld, have the strongest influence. Parental values, beliefs and attitudes are communicated through verbal and non-verbal interactions. Positive and negative conditional regard were found to be motivational tools used by parents to encourage young adolescents to perform according to their expectations. Young adolescents often internalise or introject parental values, beliefs and attitudes as a result of the level of their moral development. Unrealistic or perfectionistic expectations often lead to high levels of anxiety and stress. This could interfere with their normal developmental tasks of which identity formation, the development of self-control and self-regulation appear to be very important aspects. From the findings of the study, guidelines for parents and educators were compiled in support of young adolescents who find themselves in a high-achieving academic environment.
