25|$|On 2 April, CSKA club {{president}} Aleksandar Tomov transferred his <b>controlling</b> <b>block</b> {{of shares}} to Milko Georgiev and Borislav Lazarov, with club supporters intending {{to find a}} new owner and major sponsors capable of paying off the club's numerous debts. On 24 April, it was officially announced the club's new controlling owner would be the corporation Finance Marketing Company Ltd. CSKA finished the season in fifth position, but due to the unfunded debts, the BFU refused to issue the club a license for A Group for the upcoming season, instead sending the club to the South-Western V group, the third tier of Bulgarian football.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the initial}} success of its {{flagship}} Atlantic City property, Resorts International struggled {{to compete with}} its competition as more casinos were developed on the boardwalk. Newer and more extravagant resorts began to erode market share and interest in the property during the 1980s, and Resorts International added to the problem by not making any significant upgrades to the property. Instead, the company focused on expanding its operations in the market by announcing in the mid 1980s its plans {{to develop a new}} property in Atlantic City called the Taj Mahal Casino. Financial difficulties, however, prevented Resorts International from ever completing the Taj Mahal project, and in 1987 the company became a takeover target when Donald Trump purchased a <b>controlling</b> <b>block</b> of Resorts International stock.|$|E
5000|$|In {{publicly}} held companies, [...] "poison pills" [...] refer to various methods to deter takeover bids. Takeover bids are attempts by a bidder to obtain {{control of a}} target company, either by soliciting proxies to get elected to the board or by acquiring a <b>controlling</b> <b>block</b> of shares and using the associated votes to get elected to the board. Once {{in control of the}} board, the bidder can manage the target. As discussed below, targets have various takeover defenses available, and several types of defense have been called [...] "poison pills" [...] because they harm not only the bidder, but the target (or its shareholders) as well.

50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to {{navigate}} through Groken Castle to rescue Princess Margarita. The player can push certain objects throughout the game to accomplish progress.

The prince must also carry a key that matches the color of the door he intends to be open. The player can navigate the castle {{with the help of a}} map that can be obtained from the first room that he/she begins.

50|$|The Castle is an MSX game {{released}} by ASCII Corporation in 1986. The game is set within a castle containing 100 rooms, {{most of which}} contain one or more puzzles.

In some rooms, the prince can only advance to the next room by aligning cement blocks, Honey Jars, Candle Cakes, and Elevator <b>Controlling</b> <b>Block.</b> Additionally, the player's progress is blocked by many doors requiring a key of the same color to unlock, and a key is removed from the player's inventory upon use. The prince must be standing on a platform next to the door to be able to unlock it, and cannot simply jump or fall and press against the door. The player can navigate the castle {{with the help of a}} map that can be obtained early in the game.

50|$|Kazzinc JSC {{operated}} {{most of the}} country’s {{lead and}} zinc mining and metallurgical enterprises. It also produced copper and precious metals. It employed about 22,000 people in mining, beneficiation, metallurgy, power generation, and auxiliary production. The company was established in 1997 through the merger of eastern Kazakhstan’s three main nonferrous metals companies—Leninogorsk (now Ridder) Polymetallic complex, Ust-Kamenogorsk Lead and Zinc complex, and Zyryanovsk Lead Complex. The <b>controlling</b> <b>block</b> of shares in Kazzinc was sold {{by the state to}} the private sector, with Glencore International AG of Switzerland becoming the company’s main investor. In addition to Kazzinc, ZAO Yuzhpolimetal Corp. produced about 60,000 t/yr of lead metal from its Shymkent lead plant; and Kazakhmys produced more than 20,000 t/yr of zinc metal at the Balkhash zinc plant (Notarov, 2005).Kazzinc’s development strategy called for it to join the ranks of the world’s leading producers of lead and zinc. Almost all Kazakhstan’s lead and zinc production was exported, which placed Kazakhstan already among the world’s leading lead and zinc exporting countries. In 2005, Kazakhstan’s lead and zinc producing enterprises were operating below capacity. The Ust-Kamenogorsk complex had the capacity to produce more than 150,000 t/yr of lead and 240,000 t/yr of zinc; the Ridder complex, 25,000 t/yr of lead and 110,000 t/yr of zinc; and the Balkhash zinc plant, 100,000 t/yr of zinc. The Shymkent lead plant was working far below capacity owing to a lack of raw material.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies block {{trades and}} tender offers as {{alternative}} means for transferring corporate control in firms with a dominant minority blockholder and an otherwise dispersed ownership structure. Incumbent and new controlling parties strictly prefer to trade the <b>controlling</b> <b>block.</b> From a social point of view, however, {{this method is}} inferior to tender offers, because it preserves {{a low level of}} ownership concentration which induces more inefficient extraction of private control benefits. This discrepancy is caused by the free-riding behaviour of small shareholders. Moreover, the <b>controlling</b> <b>block</b> trades at a premium which reflects, in part, the surplus that the incumbent and the acquirer realize by avoiding a tender offer and the consequent transfer to small shareholders. Therefore, factors that alter the pay-offs of small shareholders in a tender offer (e. g. supermajority rules, disclosure rules and non-voting shares) also alter the block premium. Finally, the paper argues that greenmail, like block trading, enables the controlling parties to preserve low levels of ownership concentration and large private control benefits. block premia; greenmail; takeover regulation; tender offers...|$|E
