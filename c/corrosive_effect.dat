2500|$|Phenol and its vapors are {{corrosive}} to the eyes, the skin, and {{the respiratory}} tract.

Long-term or repeated exposure of the substance may have harmful effects on the liver and kidneys. There is no evidence that phenol causes cancer in humans. Besides its hydrophobic effects, another mechanism for the toxicity of phenol may be the formation of phenoxyl radicals.|$|E

2500|$|Early humanists saw no {{conflict}} between reason and their Christian faith (see Christian Humanism). They inveighed against {{the abuses of}} the Church, but not against the Church itself, much less against religion. For them, the word [...] "secular" [...] carried no connotations of disbeliefthat would come later, in the nineteenth century. In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply {{to be in the}} world rather than in a monastery. Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own (although Petrarch himself was in Minor Orders and was employed by the Church all his life). He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue, inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer. By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base, however, the methods of the humanists, combined with their eloquence, would ultimately have a <b>corrosive</b> <b>effect</b> on established authority.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1964, after Khánh {{decided to}} take more power for himself by declaring a state of {{emergency}} and introducing a new constitution, Buddhists launched protests against the new junta, claiming that there was a plot to revive the Diêm era by predominantly Catholic groups such as Cần Lao veterans and Đại Việt supporters, pinpointing Khiêm and Thiệu, both Catholics who had been favoured by Diêm. Khánh's concessions to the Buddhists sparked opposition from Khiêm and Thiệu, who tried to remove Khánh in favour of Minh, recruiting other officers. Khiêm said [...] "Khánh felt there was no choice but to accept since the influence of [...] Trí Quang was so great that he could not only turn {{the majority of the people}} against the government but could influence the effectiveness of the armed forces".

60|$|Mrs. Rooth {{was very}} fond of a moral and had never lost her taste for edification. She delighted in a {{beautiful}} character and was gratified to find so many more than she had supposed represented in the contemporary French drama. She never failed to direct Miriam's attention {{to them and to}} remind her that there is nothing in life so grand as a sublime act, above all when sublimely explained. Peter made much of the difference between the mother and the daughter, thinking it singularly marked--the way one took everything for the sense, or behaved as if she did, caring only for the plot and the romance, the triumph or defeat of virtue and the moral comfort of it all, and the way the other was alive but to the manner and the art of it, the intensity of truth to appearances. Mrs. Rooth abounded in impressive evocations, and yet he saw no link between her facile genius and that of which Miriam gave symptoms. The poor lady never could have been accused of successful deceit, whereas the triumph of fraud was exactly what her clever child achieved. She made even the true seem fictive, while Miriam's effort was to make the fictive true. Sherringham thought it an odd unpromising stock (that of the Neville-Nugents) for a dramatic talent to have sprung from, till he reflected that the evolution was after all natural: the figurative impulse in the mother had become conscious, and therefore higher, through finding an aim, which was beauty, in the daughter. Likely enough the Hebraic Mr. Rooth, with his love of old pots and Christian altar-cloths, had supplied in the girl's composition the esthetic element, the sense of colour and form. In their visits to the theatre there was nothing Mrs. Rooth more insisted on than the unprofitableness of deceit, as shown by the most distinguished authors--the folly and degradation, the <b>corrosive</b> <b>effect</b> on the spirit, of tortuous ways. Their companion soon gave up the futile task of piecing together her incongruous references to her early life and her family in England. He renounced even the doctrine that there was a residuum of truth in her claim of great relationships, since, existent or not, he cared equally little for her ramifications. The principle of this indifference was at bottom a certain desire to disconnect and isolate Miriam; for it was disagreeable not to be independent in dealing with her, and he could be fully so only if she herself were.|$|E
