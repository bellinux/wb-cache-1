5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the <b>convention</b> <b>center</b> as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the <b>Convention</b> <b>Center</b> was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E
