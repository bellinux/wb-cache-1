40|$|A {{matching}} function methodology is used {{to investigate}} the macroeconomic effects of labor market program (LMP) <b>commencements</b> on youth unemployment outflows in Australia using unpublished data that classify <b>commencements</b> and outflows by duration of unemployment. The results indicate that LMPs have had significant effects on outflows from short-term unemployment. There is a net positive effect from LMP <b>commencements</b> on short-term unemployed female outflow rates. However, females experienced negative spillover effects from male LMP <b>commencements.</b> These spillover effects appear {{to be associated with}} wage subsidy programs and suggest the net impact of such programs may have been overstated in previous studies.
