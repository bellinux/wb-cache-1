40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} of the spatial inventor networks in Sweden by examining the residence of inventors and <b>coinventors</b> in Swedish patent applications to the European Patent Office. Several factors are found to influence the spatial affinity. We find that spatial affinity is strongly influenced by the general size of the nodes, as measured by population. In addition, affinities are strongly influenced by distance, but different technologies responded differently to distance. The most distance-sensitive technology, i. e. with the highest agglomeration of <b>coinventors,</b> was almost three times as sensitive to distance as the least sensitive. Interestingly, "Information technology" was the least distance-sensitive technology, which would be in line with predictions of "the death of distance". Higher affinity was also registered for many technologies when more university researchers were employed in one of the regions. Hence, a technology division is appropriate for understanding the span of innovation networks over regions, and how these could develop in response to policy initiatives.

To answer the research question, it was analyzed inventors’ data collected from EPO-PastSat database from 1979 until 1999. The results show that, consistent to previous research, teams produce better inventions than lone inventors. Moreover, specialist inventors benefit from collaboration more than generalists, {{but only if the}} team have a significant number of <b>coinventors.</b> Lastly, the positive impact on invention quality is more relevant for experienced inventors...|$|R

Several factors are found to influence the spatial affinity of regions. We find that spatial affinity extends beyond the region if it has less own R&D-related resources (business R&D, university R&D and patenting); if it is close to the other region and if it is relatively small. The resources of that other region plays a positive role if, in analogue fashion, that region has more R&D-related resources. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the formation of}} networks in which each agent is assumed to possess some information of value to the other agents in the network. Agents derive payoff from having access to the information of others through communication or spillovers via the links between them. Linking decisions are based on network-dependent marginal payoff and a network independent noise capturing exogenous idiosyncratic effects. Moreover, agents have a limited observation radius when deciding to whom to form a link. I find that for small noise the observation radius does not matter and strongly centralized networks emerge. However, for large noise, a smaller observation radius generates networks with a larger degree variance. These networks can also be shown to have larger aggregate payoff. I then estimate the model using a network of <b>coinventors</b> and scientific collaborations in physics and economics, and find that the model can closely reproduce a variety of observed patterns. I show that local search is important in all the empirical networks considered, but that economists tend to search more broadly for new collaboration opportunities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Many {{important}} (particularly industry) {{solutions to}} research problems {{are included in}} patents, but not in academic publications. We studied patents invented by researchers associated with the annual IEEE/IFIP Business-Driven IT Management (BDIM) workshops and selected for in-depth analysis 4 granted patents and 19 pending patent applications most closely related to BDIM topics. These patents address diverse applications, most commonly resource allocation and contract management. Similarly, they have diverse official classifications, most often the International Patent Classification classes G 06 Q 10 / 00 and G 06 F 17 / 60 and the US Patent Classification class 705 / 7. We found that all analyzed patents were invented by either IBM or HP employees and determined the most prolific inventors, both those associated with the BDIM workshops and additional <b>coinventors.</b> Our year-by-year analysis indicates some growth in interest in BDIM-related innovation. By examining citations by and citations of the studied 23 patents, we found additional BDIMrelated patents. We also concluded that only 4 patents emphasize ease of operation, important for crossing the chasm between early and mainstream customers. Additional information and insights about the BDIM area from our study complement the past academic literature surveys and can guide future patent analyses.

40|$|In {{the book}} "Ferroelectric and Antiferroelectric Liquid Crystals" by S. T. Lagerwall, the concept "polar liquid crystals" is {{proposed}} for the concept earlier known as "ferroelectric liquid crystals", reserving the word "ferroelectric liquid crystals" for the case of "surface stabilization". Thus Lagerwall in this way, by redefinition, becomes the <b>coinventor</b> of "ferroelectric liquid crystals". The trouble is that a closer look on the invention reveals a state of bad logic and a total confusion. The concepts "polar", "ferroelectric", "hysteresis", "SSFLC" and "bistability" are essential {{in the writing of}} Lagerwall, but these words are not used in a rigorous way. Also the pictorial evidence used by Lagerwall to illustrate the discovery of surface stabilized liquid crystals raises several questions. An alternative view of the physics of SSFLC cells is presented. Comment: 46 pages, 8 figures, review of book "Ferroelectric and Antiferroelectric Liquid Crystals" by Sven T.

40|$|Although mature {{clinical}} {{data from}} multiple ongoing studies {{have not yet}} been reported, it appears that, although vemurafenib can achieve rapid and clinically valuable remissions, elimination of detectable minimal residual disease (MRD) has not yet been reported even after complete response. 7 Currently, the most sensitive standard test for HCL MRD is flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate. As shown in this study, the ability of bone marrow stromal cells to block the effect of BRAF inhibition suggests a possible mechanism for persistence of HCL in the bone marrow by flow cytometry after clearance of MRD by other studies. However, persistence of MRD only in the bone marrow is common in HCL after other types of treatments as well. 5 Clinical relapse within several months has been documented after partial response to vemurafenib. 8 How long patients can be maintained after relapse from complete or partial remission before requiring additional therapy has yet to be reported. Thus far, other treatments for HCL that are associated with elimination of HCL MRD include cladribine alone, at least in a minority of cases, purine analogs combined with rituximab in a majority of cases, and the anti-CD 22 recombinant immunotoxin moxetumomab pasudotox. 5, 10 It will be exciting to determine whether MRD elimination and prevention of relapse in HCL can be achieved by combining targeted approaches and lead to chemotherapy-free initial and salvage treatment of this disease.

40|$|Antibiotic‐resistant {{bacteria}} ‘superbugs’ are {{an emerging}} threat {{to public health}} due to the decrease in effective antibiotics {{as well as the}} slowed pace of development of new antibiotics to replace those that become ineffective. The need for new antimicrobial agents is a well‐documented issue relating to world health. Tremendous efforts have been given to developing compounds that not only show high efficacy, but also those that are less susceptible to resistance development in the bacteria. However, the development of newer, stronger antibiotics which can overcome these acquired resistances is still a scientific challenge because a new mode of antimicrobial action is likely required. To that end, amphiphilic, cationic polymers have emerged as a promising candidate for further development as an antimicrobial agent with decreased potential for resistance development. These polymers are designed to mimic naturally occurring host‐defense antimicrobial peptides which act on bacterial cell walls or membranes. Antimicrobial‐peptide mimetic polymers display antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria including drug‐resistant strains and are less susceptible to resistance development in bacteria. These polymers also showed selective activity to bacteria over mammalian cells. Antimicrobial polymers provide a new molecular framework for chemical modification and adaptation to tune their biological functions. The peptide‐mimetic design of antimicrobial polymers will be versatile, generating a new generation of antibiotics toward implementation of polymers in biomedical applications.
