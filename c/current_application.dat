The <b>current</b> <b>application</b> icon in the upper {{right-hand}} corner of the menu bar cycles between open applications; {{it is not a}} menu. System 6 supports 24bits of addressable random access memory (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with no provision for virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has a hard drive capacity limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a drive. This limitation was not increased until System 7.5 which first increased the limit to 4GB.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} purpose of HSL and HSV and similar models, and their most common <b>current</b> <b>application,</b> is in color selection tools. At their simplest, some such color pickers provide three sliders, {{one for each}} attribute. Most, however, show a two-dimensional slice through the model, along with a slider controlling which particular slice is shown. The latter type of GUI exhibits great variety, because of the choice of cylinders, hexagonal prisms, or cones/bicones that the models suggest (see the diagram {{near the top of}} the page). Several color choosers from the 1990s are shown to the right, most of which have remained nearly unchanged in the intervening time: today, nearly every computer color chooser uses HSL or HSV, at least as an option. Some more sophisticated variants are designed for choosing whole sets of colors, basing their suggestions of compatible colors on the HSL or HSV relationships between them.|$|E
