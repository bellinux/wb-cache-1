We use the largest consistent set (LCS) (Chwe (1994)) as the solution concept for stability. We show that there exists a value function such that for every <b>component</b> <b>balanced</b> and anonymous allocation rule, the corresponding LCS does not contain any strongly efficient network. Using Pareto efficiency, a weaker concept of efficiency, we get a more positive result. However, then also, at least one environment of networks (with a <b>component</b> <b>balanced</b> and anonymous allocation rule) exists for which the largest consistent set does not contain any Pareto efficient network. These confirm that the well-known problem of the incompatibility between the set of stable networks and the set of efficient networks persists even in the environment with farsighted players.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figs.  5 and 6, monomeric xylose yield was {{improved}} by roughly 10 yield {{points in the}} three high-solids deacetylation samples in both sets of pretreatment experiments. This is likely due to the decreased xylan loss in deacetylation, and thus the preservation of easily-extractible xylose in the feedstock that was solubilized during acid hydrolysis. Interestingly, the soluble xylo-oligosaccharides yield from xylan was comparable across all samples at a given pretreatment condition, despite the difference in total and monomeric xylose yield. Conversion to furfural was minimal (1 – 2  %), as expected, given the relatively mild pretreatment conditions and modest acid loadings (0.5  % w/w during pre-impregnation). Xylan <b>component</b> <b>balance</b> closure ranged between 97 and 100  % for all samples.|$|E

Six <b>component</b> <b>balance</b> data, oil flow visualization photographs, and pressure distribution measurements were obtained, and tests made to study the development of flow separation at stall on small scale planform wing models.

Both experimental and numerical works are carried out where an array of VGs is attached on Aludra UAV's wing.

The hybrids are of the branch-line type, which can be machined in a split block configuration on a CNC milling machine. The prototype designs are for the WR- 10 band (75 – 110 GHz), but the dimensions are chosen to allow scaling to any waveguide band up to ~ 700 GHz. The designs were optimized using a space mapping procedure, with a fast but approximate microwave circuit simulator (MMICAD) and a slower but accurate FDTD EM simulator (QuickWave). Introduction and Goals Quadrature hybrids are used in balanced mixers and amplifiers, sideband-separating mixers, and power dividers and combiners. In developing receivers for ALMA, waveguide quadrature hybrids have been proposed for power combining in the first LO system [1], and for a balanced sideband-separating SIS mixer [2]. The latter requires three RF quadrature hybrids, one for sideband separation and one for each of the <b>component</b> <b>balance...</b>|$|E

In particular, computing platforms from supercomputers to smartphones can now incorporate both CPU and GPU processors. Disparities between CPU and GPU processor architectures have naturally led to distinct programming models and development patterns for each component. Developers for a specific system decompose their application, assign different parts to different heterogeneous components, and express each part in its assigned component’s native model. But without additional effort, that application will not be suitable for another architecture with a different heterogeneous <b>component</b> <b>balance.</b> Developers addressing a variety of platforms must either write multiple implementations for every potential heterogeneous component or fall back to a “safe ” CPU implementation, incurring a high development cost or loss of system performance, respectively. The disadvantages of developing for heterogeneous systems are vastly reduced if one source code implementation can be mapped to either a CPU or GPU architecture with high performance.
