Making the best use of new weighing scale called a multi-stage <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scale which can be created so as to adjust the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> length to the product length, we propose a simplified and effective mass estimation algorithm under practical vibration modes. <b>Conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> scales usually have maximum capacities of less than 80 kg and 140 cm, and achieve measuring rates of 150 packages per minute and more.

50|$|Lower {{side panels}} and/or gates of sheet metal, timber or <b>conveyor</b> <b>belting</b> {{are used in}} some cases to ensure animals’ legs do not get caught and reduce the {{likelihood}} of operator injury. At least one side gate is usually split to allow access to various parts of the animal being held, as well as providing access to feed a calf, amongst other things. A squeeze crush has a manual or hydraulic mechanism to squeeze the animal from the sides, immobilizing the animal while keeping bruising to a minimum. A sliding entrance gate, operated {{from the side of the}} crush, is set a few feet behind the captured animal to allow for clearance and prevent other animals entering. Crushes will, in many cases, have a single or split veterinary gate that swings behind the animal to improve operator safety, while preventing the animal from moving backwards by a horizontal rump bar inserted just behind its haunches into one of a series of slots. If this arrangement is absent, a palpation cage can be added to the crush for veterinary use when artificial insemination or pregnancy testing is being performed, or for other uses. Older crushes can also be found to have a guillotine gate that is also operated from the side via rope or chain where the gate is raised up for the animal to go under upon entering the crush, and then let down behind the animal.|$|E

40|$|While {{there is}} a clear impact of aerosol {{particles}} on the radiation balance, whether and how aerosol particles influence precipitation is controversial. Here we use the ECHAM 6 -HAM global climate model coupled to an aerosol module to analyse whether an impact of anthropogenic aerosol particles on the timing and amount of precipitation can be detected in North Pacific warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts.</b> Warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> are the strongest precipitation-producing airstreams in extratropical cyclones and are identified here with a Lagrangian technique, i. e. by objectively identifying the most strongly ascending trajectories in North Pacific cyclones. These <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> have been identified separately in 10 -year ECHAM 6 -HAM simulations with present-day and pre-industrial aerosol conditions. Then, the evolution of aerosols and cloud properties has been analysed in detail along the identified warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories. The results show that, under present-day conditions, some warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories are strongly polluted (i. e. high concentrations of black carbon and sulfur dioxide) due to horizontal transport from eastern Asia to the oceanic region where warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> start their ascent. In these polluted trajectories a weak delay and reduction of precipitation formation occurs compared to clean warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories. However, all warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> consist of both polluted and clean trajectories at the time they start their ascent, and the typically more abundant clean trajectories strongly reduce the aerosol impact from the polluted trajectories. The main conclusion then is that the overall amount of precipitation is comparable in pre-industrial conditions, when all warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> trajectories are clean, and in present-day conditions, when warm <b>conveyor</b> <b>belts</b> consist of a mixture of clean and polluted trajectories...|$|R

40|$|At the {{commencement}} of this study, some sensitive overseas markets were rejecting chilled vacuum-packed New Zealand lamb due to higher than expected total viable counts, and counts of Enterobacteriaceae, a family of bacteria used to indicate sanitary condition. Of the many factors that influence the bacterial composition of chilled lamb in the overseas marketplace, the meat producer can only exert significant control over: Hygiene, ensuring the bacterial viable count on the meat prior to packaging is as low as possible, and comprised of as few species as possible {{that are capable of}} anaerobic growth at chilled meat temperatures. Maintaining the pH of the meat within acceptable limits, by careful animal selection and minimal pre-slaughter stress. Refrigeration temperatures, through rigorous maintenance of the cold-chain. The type of preservative packaging used, which is often limited by regulation in the marketplace. Initial work established that the bacterial microbiota present on the meat contact surfaces in the butchering facilities at some premises, in particular <b>conveyor</b> <b>belting,</b> was excessive and comprised of species that contributed to the high counts on the meat reported above. As a means of improving the hygiene of this process, this study investigated the hypothesis that some species of bacteria were able to form biofilms on the conveyor belt contact surfaces, becoming reservoirs for cross-contamination. This hypothesis was not been proven by this work; the results showing that biofilms were not present and that adequate hygiene of these surfaces instead depends on the ability to remove all meat-based residues from them at the completion of each day's processing. For premises operating interlocking belts from one manufacturer (Intraloxreg), a clean-in-place system is now available that is able to achieve this. Premises operating conventional disinfectant and water sanitisation of either continuous or interlocking belts must ensure that meat residue is completely removed before disinfection. The majority of New Zealand meat industry premises can now demonstrate that their hygienic processes in this area are under control. The microbiota of <b>conveyor</b> <b>belting</b> in this study was found to consist of bacteria from five taxonomic groups; the Flavobacteriaceae, the Actinomycetales, the Bacillus/Clostridium group, and the alpha and gamma branches of the Proteobacteria. The genera present on belts from premises whose hygiene was found to be in control did not contain species known to cause food-borne disease or spoilage of vacuum packaged meats. The bacterial viable count remains the most effective method available at this time for monitoring conveyor belt hygiene. Attempts to develop a monitoring system based on microscopy of an in-situ sampling device were unsuccessful due to an inability to penetrate the meat residue matrix.

Laboratory studies focused first on selection of the optimum barrier design, which {{proved to be a}} simple, gobside barrier (made of <b>conveyor</b> <b>belting),</b> coupled with a headgate splitter arm, which was found necessary to prevent the dust cloud from entering the walkway at the headgate end of the shearer when cutting tail to head. Further laboratory testing was done to determine whether using passive barriers in combination with different water-spray dust-reduction methods, including the shearer-clearer system developed by the Bureau, would improve dust reduction over that from using the water sprays alone. It was found that the combination of gobs ide passive barriers plus the full shearer-clearer system was most effective, and surmised that this would be especially useful in thicker seams. However, underground testing revealed that the shearer-clearer system alone was 35 pct more effective in reducing dust contamination than when used with the gobside passive barriers, and far more effective than using passive barriers with a conventional water spray system.
