Extracted samples were re-suspended in 100 [*]μl of ethyl acetate and subjected to gas chromatographic (GC) analysis using AutoSystem XL Gas chromatograph (Perkin Elmer, USA) equipped with the flame ionization detector. The thermal profile used for GC analysis was as follows: <b>constant</b> <b>temperature</b> for injector, <b>oven</b> and detector at 250 °C, 200 °C and 280 °C respectively. Subsequent qualitative analysis of the reaction product was carried out with Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using Shimadzu QP 2010 (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments., USA). The identity of the reaction product was ascertained by mass fragmentation pattern and its comparison with the compound database NIST 62 - LIB available on the GC-MS instrument.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} a beef {{roasting}} model {{is used to}} analyze the behaviour of two significant parameters during roasting: process times and weight losses, as a function of <b>oven</b> <b>temperature.</b> The cooking model considers conductive heat transfer inside the sample and take into account both evaporative and dripping losses. The evaporative losses are considered at the surface of the meat. The dripping losses are predicted through the internal moisture content variation, which is modelled as a function of water demand. Such water demand is the difference between actual water content and the water holding capacity of beef. For model simulation six 3 D irregular geometrics models of semitendinosus muscle were used. In all cases <b>constant</b> <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> was considered, with operative limits of 150 and 230 °C. A restriction to the optimization problem was imposed: the coldest point must reach a minimum temperature of 72 °C. The model prediction indicates that an increase in <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> leads to a decrease in cooking time and an increase in weight loss. In average, rates of variation with <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> are - 0. 3 min/°C for cooking time, and 0. 21 %/°C for weight loss, which are similar to published experimental results. Because of the mentioned behaviour, a compromise situation is encountered, since no operative condition lead to a minimization of both objectives...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of water absorbing/releasing of 4 A Molecular sieve desiccant was primarily investigated by weighting method. Three kinds of saturated salt solutions of Zinc Bromide, Potassium Acetate and Magnesium Chloride {{were employed in}} a <b>constant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>oven</b> to simulate the different environment of humidity of test samples. The {{results show that the}} saturated water absorbing capability of Molecular sieve desiccant distinctly depends on the environmental condition of depositing. It increases linearly with the deposited time if the temperature keeps constant, and its slope changes with the humidity. The saturated water absorbing capability of Zeolte desiccant increase with the increasing environmental humuidity. The water absorbing rate of sacked Molecular sieve desiccant is only 1 / 6 of the essential value. After water absorbing capability is saturated, relative humidity equilibrium exists between the environment and Molecular sieve desiccant, and the humidity of Molecular sieve desiccant varies in the range of 6. 1 - 31. 9 %. Under the condition of lower humidity of Silica Gel and Molecular sieve desiccant, the adsorbent water in the surface of Molecular sieve desiccant was released...|$|E
40|$|Multilayered polymer {{films with}} biomimicking, layered {{structures}} have unique microstructures and many potential applications. However, a major limitation of polymer films is {{the deterioration of}} mechanical properties in working environments. To facilitate the design and development of multilayered polymer films, the impact of thermal aging on the mechanical behavior of micro- and nano-layered polymer films has been investigated experimentally. The composition of the polymer films that have been studied is 50 vol% polycarbonate (PC) and 50 vol% poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The current study focuses {{on the effect of}} film and layer thickness and temperature on the mechanical properties of the materials subjected to thermal aging. To study the effect of film and layer thickness, films with the same thickness, but various layer thicknesses, and films with the same layer thickness, but various film thicknesses, were thermally aged at 100 °C in a <b>constant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>oven</b> for up to six weeks. The results show that as the layer thickness decreases to 31 nm, the film has a higher stiffness and strength, and the trend of the mechanical properties is relatively stable over aging. The ductility of all of the films decreases with aging time. To study the effect of temperature, the films with 4, 096 layers (31 nm thick for each layer) were aged at 100 °C, 115 °C and 125 °C for up to four weeks. While the 100 °C aging results in a slight increase of the stiffness and strength of the films, the higher aging temperature caused a decrease of the stiffness and strength of the films. The ductility decreases with the aging time for all of the temperatures. The films become more brittle for higher aging temperatures...|$|E

40|$|A bio-refinery is a {{facility}} that converts renewable bio-resources into value-added chemicals and products. In this context of a bio-refinery, {{the production of the}} carbochemicals such as HMF, furfural and organic acids illustrate that multiple products can be produced from a renewable source such as lignocellulosic biomass (switchgrass). Traditionally, carbochemicals such as furfural and HMF are produced using inorganic acids such as H 2 SO 4, HCL, and H 3 PO 4. The use of such acids requires the application of high cost materials of construction such as Hastelloy-C, titanium etc. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a semi-continuous process for the conversion of switchgrass to carbochemicals such as HMF, furfural and organic acids. Moreover, the application of water as a green reaction medium and the utilization of carbonated water as a 2 ̆ 2 green catalyst 2 ̆ 2 were studied in this research. For the purpose of this study, we constructed a semi-continuous flow apparatus using three high precision Isco syringe pumps and a <b>constant</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>oven</b> to allow carbonation of the water over a range of temperatures and pressure to reactively pretreat switchgrass. Carbochemicals (furan-based aldehydes) and acids that were formed were detected using a Waters HPLC employing a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX- 87 H column with a PDA (photo diode array) detector at wavelengths range of 210 and 280 nm. Oligosaccharides were detected using Dionex HPLC employing Bio-Rad Aminex HPX- 87 P column using a Shodex RI- 101 refractive index detector. The kinetics of the formation and degradation of HMF and furfural were studied using the solver function in Microsoft Excel. Carbonated water clearly showed catalytic activity by increasing the yields of the HMF and furfural at temperatures of 220, 250 and 280 °C. The highest catalytic activity was observed for HMF formation in carbonated water with a nine-fold increase in yields over that using neat subcritical water...|$|E

40|$|Many {{modulation}} {{systems in}} comprehensive 2 D GC (GC×GC) {{are based on}} cryogenic methods. High trapping temperatures in these systems can result in ineffective trapping of the more volatile compounds, whilst temperatures that are too low can prevent efficient remobilisation of some compounds.

These investigations have led us to modify the temperature regulation capabilities of the longitudinally modulated cryogenic system (LMCS). In contrast to the current system, where the user sets a <b>constant</b> <b>temperature</b> for the cooling chamber, the user now sets the temperature difference between the cryo-trap and the chromatographic oven. In this configuration, the cooling chamber temperature increases during the chromatographic run, tracking the <b>oven</b> <b>temperature</b> ramp. This produces more efficient, volatility-dependent modulation, and increases the range of volatile compounds that can be analysed under optimal trap-and-release conditions within a single analytical run.

Growth of juveniles varied at different <b>constant</b> <b>temperatures</b> (P < 0. 05) and the maximum specific growth rate (SGR) was 1. 48 % day(- 1) at 16 - 18 degrees C.
