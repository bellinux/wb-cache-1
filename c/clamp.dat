5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total <b>clamp</b> force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a <b>clamp</b> force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more <b>clamp</b> tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E

The results of the <b>clamping</b> eccentricity error compensation experiment show that the <b>clamping</b> eccentric error compensation model can compensate measurement results to the results attained under operating conditions, and achieve precision measurement of involute profiles.

To reflect the relationship between <b>clamping</b> schemes and residual stresses and fatigue resistance, finite element models with different <b>clamping</b> schemes were built and the <b>clamping</b> process was simulated.

5|$|The {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Cryptothecia has been unclear, and historically, C.rubrocincta has been placed in several different genera. Like all lichens, C.rubrocincta is an association of a fungus (the mycobiont) with a photosynthetic organism (the photobiont), in this case, an algae. Initially, it was unknown whether the mycobiont component of C.rubrocincta was an ascomycete or a basidiomycete. Although {{the vast majority of}} lichen mycobionts are from the Ascomycota, in 1937 German lichenogist Friedrich Tobler believed the mycobiont to be a basidiomycete, because he interpreted some unusual microscopic structures to be <b>clamp</b> connections, structures associated only with the basidiomycete fungi. In another publication later that year, he specified the mycobiont to be a hymenomycete, and described the monotypic genus Herpothallion to supersede the old name Chiodecton sanguineum. Although Vernon Ahmadjian corroborated the presence of <b>clamp</b> connections in the species when he studied the species' cytology in 1967, other researchers did not find <b>clamp</b> connections in specimens collected from different countries. Further doubt was cast on the possibility of a basidiomycete mycobiont with the discovery of the depside confluentic acid in 1966, concentric bodies in 1975, and woronin bodies in 1983, as all of these characteristics are restricted to Ascomycetes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In any {{manufacturing}} operation, the {{deformation of}} the workpiece can be minimized by optimizing the parameters such as <b>Clamping</b> forces, Number of locators and <b>clamps</b> and Positions of locators and <b>clamps.</b> The system gives minimum deformation when <b>clamping</b> forces are minimum. The minimum <b>clamping</b> forces required {{to hold the}} workpiece can be determined by using balancing forcemoment method and the coulomb static friction law. For a milling operation the enough amount of <b>clamping</b> forces are determined for the five various positions of the tool on the workpiece. Then the maximum values of <b>clamping</b> forces among these are taken as the optimum <b>clamping</b> force.

50|$|A case of vestigial organs was {{described}} in polyopisthocotylean Monogeneans (parasitic flatworms).

5|$|Amanita australis {{mushrooms}} {{that have}} lost their warts and have had the colours faded may resemble another New Zealand species, A.nothofagi. The two species may be distinguished reliably using microscopy—A.nothofagi does not have <b>clamp</b> connections {{at the base of}} the basidia, unlike A.australis.A.australis also bears some resemblance to the eastern North American and east Asian species A.abrupta, which also has an abruptly bulbous stem base.|$|E

5|$|Amanita nothofagi {{mushrooms}} can {{be confused}} with A.australis if the warts have been washed off and the colour has been bleached. A reliable method to distinguish the two is to check {{for the presence of}} <b>clamp</b> connections at the bases of the basidia, which are present in A.australis and absent from A.nothofagi. Ridley notes that the type collection was made with a dark grey specimen, and later collectors who found browner specimens have had difficulty in correctly identifying the species. Paler specimens resemble A.excelsa, which led some to incorrectly believe that the species occurs in New Zealand. Amanita luteofusca is also similar in appearance, spore size, amyloid reaction, and lack of <b>clamp</b> connections in the basidia. It is distinguished from A.nothofagi largely on the basis of colour—it is a greyish-brown to yellowish-grey brown that fades to pinkish-buff as it gets older. Tulloss suggests that the resemblance of a number of species from Australasia and Chile which lack brightly coloured fruit bodies and share similar greyish to brownish rings and volvas may indicate that they share Gondwanan ancestors.|$|E

Perioperative outcomes were compared between groups. Results: All 30 patients underwent successful hilar <b>clamping</b> during robotic partial nephrectomy using robotic bulldog <b>clamps</b> with no intraoperative complications and {{without the need for}} readjustment/reclamping. Robotic bulldog <b>clamps</b> provided adequate ischemia even for tumors � 4 cm, hilar, endophytic, multiple tumors, and multiple renal arteries. Both groups had similar baseline characteristics.

The species is known from Mexico and Papua New Guinea. M.hudonii, known from Europe, is similar in appearance to M.funalis. However, the former has a cap covered in hairs or bristles, and differs microscopically; for instance, the hyphae feature <b>clamp</b> connections. The Malagasy species Setulipes funaliformis was named after M.funalis due to the morphological similarities between the two. The species can be differentiated by the fact that the basidiospores of S.funalformis are slightly larger and narrower, measuring from 7 to 10 by 3.5 to 4.5μm, and the caulocystidia of M.funalis are significantly longer.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in basidiomycetes {{is similar}} to that of the ascomycetes. Compatible haploid hyphae fuse to produce a dikaryotic mycelium. However, the dikaryotic phase is more extensive in the basidiomycetes, often also present in the vegetatively growing mycelium. A specialized anatomical structure, called a <b>clamp</b> connection, is formed at each hyphal septum. As with the structurally similar hook in the ascomycetes, the <b>clamp</b> connection in the basidiomycetes is required for controlled transfer of nuclei during cell division, to maintain the dikaryotic stage with two genetically different nuclei in each hyphal compartment. A basidiocarp is formed in which club-like structures known as basidia generate haploid basidiospores after karyogamy and meiosis. The most commonly known basidiocarps are mushrooms, but they may also take other forms (see Morphology section).|$|E

40|$|AbstractCarbon fiber {{reinforced}} composites (CFRP) {{are mostly}} manufactured near net shape. Nevertheless, a final milling step {{at the edges}} of the cured components is still necessary. Damages which occur during milling or drilling of CFRP lower the durability of the components and increase the production costs. Requirements concerning the <b>clamping</b> system for milling or drilling CFRP are rising simultaneously with increasing complexity of the components. This stresses the need for complex <b>clamping</b> systems like linear <b>clamping</b> jaws around the whole workpiece. However such types of <b>clamping</b> systems induce poor accessibility to the component being worked on and hence longer machining time. As a result to the need for complex <b>clamping</b> systems, the production costs are increased. Therefore, several benefits can be achieved by increasing the distances between the <b>clamping</b> points of the <b>clamping</b> system to reduce machining time and production costs. This paper discusses investigations of milling tests with variable <b>clamping</b> conditions of the workpieces. In the experiments a linear milling operation the edge of the workpiece is examined. The <b>clamping</b> of the planar specimens was realized with a <b>clamping</b> system which enables the adjustment of different distances between the <b>clamping</b> points of the specimen.
