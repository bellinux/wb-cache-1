40|$|Abstract. A {{mechanistic}} model capable of predicting end milling cutting forces in brittle porous media is described. A coefficient which {{is capable of}} reproducing the random shape and variation in cutting forces due to porosity is proposed. In addition, a method of experimental determination of cutting force coefficients is outlined. The proposed model {{is based on the}} hypothesis that the random shape and variation in cutting forces of brittle porous media coincide with the shape and variation of pore size and distribution in the media. The developed coefficient and model is compared to end milling tests conducted in CB 1100, a porous machinable alumina based ceramic manufactured by UMECO. High correlation between predicted and measured cutting forces is shown. Experiments show that the model is capable of accurate prediction of variation in individual <b>cutting</b> <b>tooth</b> force profile shape and overall magnitude over the entire range of machining conditions tested. The benefit of the model lies in its ability to greatly reduce the number of cutting tests required when investigating cutting forces in novel brittle porous materials...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the feed}} motion, the {{dynamics}} of constant spindle speed (CSS) milling processes is described {{by a set of}} delay differential equations with periodic coefficients and a variable time delay associated with each <b>cutting</b> <b>tooth.</b> This model, which has been developed {{for the first time as}} a part of this dissertation, is used to study the dynamics and stability of the system. The semi-discretization scheme, a numerical scheme with an analytical basis, is refined to examine the stability of periodic solutions of this system. This scheme can be used to predict not only the stability but also the chatter frequencies for a wide variety of milling operations ranging from full-immersion to partial-immersion operations. From the results obtained thus far, it can be stated that feed-rate effects can be neglected during full-immersion and high-immersion operations, where the influence of loss of contact nonlinearities is not pronounced. However, for low-immersion milling operations, where loss of contact effects have a strong influence on system stability behavior, high feed-rate effects are pronounced and this effects can’t be ignored. Along with investigations into {{the dynamics of}} CSS milling processes, in this dissertation,...|$|E

40|$|Chatter is a {{particularly}} severe and damaging form of tool vibration that can occur in milling processes under certain combinations of spindle speed and axial depth of cut. The ability to predict the onset of chatter in a particular tool - workpiece dynamic system could enable {{the development of a}} real-time control system that predicts and avoids chatter conditions. Various Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) are considered here for estimating modal parameters or cutting force coefficients of the tool- workpiece dynamic system from tool deflection measurements in high-speed low-radial-immersion milling. These parameter estimates could be used to predict the dynamic stability of the system. A novel application of an EKF is proposed here to estimate both a radial and a tangential cutting force coefficient. Separate sets of force coefficients for each <b>cutting</b> <b>tooth</b> may also be estimated, and the system is found to be observable. The EKF is tested on simulated measurements and found to perform accurately and repeatably. The EKF is also tested on experimental measurements, and the resulting parameter estimates result in simulations that correlate well with experimental tool deflection trajectories. Model modifications are also proposed that could improve accuracy, including the addition of centrifugal and Coriolis inertial forces and a means of accounting for tool eccentricity...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model is presented by which the cutting forces in gear form milling process are predicted using the mechanistic approach. To use this approach, {{a detailed description of}} the chip geometry is needed. Eccentricity and run-out tool errors are considered, which is of great importance as the chip thickness will by these errors vary for the subsequent cuts. The chip geometry is determined by comparing the path of the cutting edge with already removed material. The boundary of the chips is determinable from the cutting edge geometry, which is here derived in parametric form so spur and helical gears are manufactured correctly. Locally on the cutting edge, the cutting forces are resolved from orthogonal cutting data and on the basis that these forces are proportional to the instantaneous chip thickness. The load each individual <b>cutting</b> <b>tooth</b> experience in operation, as well as the complete load on the tool, are resolved by summing the forces along the cutting edge. In the model, all cut chips are determined for each machined gear tooth gap, with the gear blank boundaries considered. The paper ends with experimental validation using indexable insert milling cutters. It is shown that the model predicts the force shape well and the peak force levels within 12 %...|$|E

30|$|In the {{analytical}} model of cutting force, {{the thickness of}} shear zone {{is the key to}} study the deformation of cutting. For metal-cutting, the thickness of shear zone affects the shear strain rate γ̇ [20]. By the analysis of quick stop micrograph from cutting experiments in Ref. [20], the thickness is regarded as half of the cutting layer thickness. In the sand mould milling process, the cutting layer thickness is changed to a sinusoid (Sect.  2.4), and the cutting layer thickness varies from 0 to 1.4  mm per <b>cutting</b> <b>tooth.</b> According to the thickness of shear zone in the metal cutting, the average thickness of shear zone can be approximated by 0.4  mm, meaning the thickness of shear zone is just the thickness of 3 piled sand granules with the average mesh granularity of 100. For the granular system, Oda et al. [12] suggested that the shear zone width of the granular system without binding is about 7 ‒ 8 granules, which was also reported by Vardoulakis [21]. Moreover, Oda et al. [12] pointed out that the thickness reduces if there is the rotational resistance at contacts according to the comparison between the simulation and laboratory tests. To the sand mould, there are some binding bridges among the sands, so its shear zone thickness must be smaller than that of the granular system without binding. Considering both the aspects of shear zone thickness in metal cutting and the bound granular system, the assumption that the shear zone thickness of sand mould cutting is 3 D can be made, in which the thickness of wide zone is 2 D, that of narrow zone is D, as shown in Figure  2.|$|E
40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis has been developed to predict and measure the cutting forces in the gear hobbing process. A review of past {{research in this area}} has highlighted the need to adopt a different approach to modelling the process in order to predict the cutting forces. The hobbing process has been described using six different co-ordinate systems and the kinematic relationships between these systems established. A single rack profile has been used to represent the profile of a single <b>cutting</b> <b>tooth</b> from the hob which was then extended to simulate the hob itself. When the hob gashes pass through the cutting region surfaces are generated which, if mapped on a regular grid can give the basis to estimate the depth of cut, i. e. the instantaneous chip thickness produced by that particular tooth. The instantaneous cutting forces generated by that tooth then can be estimated by using the concept of a specific cutting force of the workpiece material. The estimation of cutting forces acting on a single tooth space was used to predict the cutting forces produced during machining of a full gear, by assuming that the forces acting in a particular tooth space are equal to those acting on the adjacent tooth space at an equivalent instant in the cutting cycle. In order to validate predicted results, a Churchill PH 1612 hobbing machine was retrofitted with a CNC control system at Newcastle University, utilising a programmable multi axis controller (PMAC). A specially made single toothed gear, and a full gear were machined, and cut on this machine, and the cutting forces measured in real time using a 3 -axis dynamometer. The force signals produced by the dynamometer were measured utilising a 12 -bit ADC card. Code, written in C, was developed to perform the many functions needed for the overall control of the machine, but additionally was used to capture both the cutting forces and axis position data. The results of the simulation and modelling have shown very good agreement with those obtained experimentally. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
