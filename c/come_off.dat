5|$|As {{with the}} 2000 champions, {{who had also}} <b>come</b> <b>off</b> a disappointing loss the year before, UConn {{returned}} hungrier than ever in 2001–02. With the TASS force in their senior season and Taurasi emerging as a star in her sophomore year, UConn rolled through its opponents throughout the year. The only close game the Huskies played all year long was a win at Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham is a snowy city {{relative}} to other large UK conurbations, due to its inland location and comparatively high elevation. Between 1961 and 1990 Birmingham Airport averaged 13.0 days of snow lying annually, compared to 5.33 at London Heathrow. Snow showers often pass through the city via the Cheshire gap on north westerly airstreams, but can also <b>come</b> <b>off</b> the North Sea from north easterly airstreams.|$|E

5|$|For XIII-2, Game Informers Joe Juba was {{disappointed}} that Lightning had been transferred to a supporting role in favor of Serah and Hope, whom he saw as weaker characters than Lightning. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found that the story suffers without {{the driving force of}} Lightning's single-minded determination. VanOrd {{was disappointed}} that Lightning and Caius Ballad have relatively limited screen-time, since they <b>come</b> <b>off</b> as stronger characters than the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{management}} of Yakin, Tasci made his first appearance of the season against Dynamo Moscow on 10 August 2014, only to <b>come</b> <b>off</b> in the 23rd minutes following an injury, as Spartak Moscow won 2–1. He then scored his first Spartak goal on 2 November 2014, in a 3–3 draw against Kuban Krasnodar. After making 23 appearance and scoring once in all competitions, Tasci was offered a new contract by the club.|$|E

He made his second debut for City against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 14 August 2010, he made a bright start hitting the {{crossbar}} with his first shot. However, after falling awkwardly from a challenge from Jody Craddock on 14 minutes Jones was forced to <b>come</b> <b>off.</b> On 13 September, Jones scored his first goal for Stoke on his home debut against Aston Villa in a 2–1 win. Jones followed this by scoring against West Ham United, Fulham in the League Cup and Newcastle United. He scored the second goal on 13 November in a 2–0 win against Liverpool at the Britannia Stadium.|$|E

He failed {{to perform in}} the first match in Launceston, taking 1/68 and 2/45 and scoring 17 and 9. However, Nash had a lively bowling {{performance}} in the Hobart match, making the ball <b>come</b> <b>off</b> the wicket at a great pace and gaining match figures of 9/137, including two wickets in consecutive balls and breaking batsman Eric Dalton's jaw with a vicious bouncer on the hat-trick ball. South African captain Jock Cameron praised Nash for his performance as his bowling in the match {{was thought to be}} as quick and dangerous as any bowler in the world.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy {{ended the}} Civil War with about fifty monitor-type coastal ironclads; by the 1870s {{most of these}} were laid up in reserve, leaving the USA {{virtually}} without an ironclad fleet. Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the USA would have <b>come</b> <b>off</b> badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers. The 1890s saw {{the beginning of what}} became the Great White Fleet, and it was the modern pre-Dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish–American War of 1898. This started a new era of naval warfare.|$|E
5|$|With Hoppe {{retired as}} of 1952, there was {{excitement}} over {{who would take}} the 1953 world three-cushion crown, {{to be held in}} Chicago at the Chicago Town Club in the Sheraton Hotel. Eleven competitors were slated to play, many repeats of the prior year, including Chamaco, Katsura, Matsuyama, Bozeman, Kilgore, Procita and Rubin. New to the field were Harold Worst of Grand Rapids, Hollywood's John Fitzpatrick, Mel Lundberg of Minneapolis and Ezequiel Navarra of Argentina. Navarra was considered the favorite by experts, having won championships that year in Cuba, Colombia, Peru and Argentina and having just <b>come</b> <b>off</b> an exhibition tour with Cochran in which Navarra averaged a formidable 1.16, scoring 1,295 three-cushions in 1,120 innings over the length of the tour.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} great {{diversity}} in scale form, they all share a similar structure. Scales, like other macrochaetes, arise from special trichogenic (hair-producing) cells and have a socket which is enclosed in a special 'tormogen' cell; this arrangement provides a stalk or pedicel by which scales {{are attached to the}} substrate. Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or 'blade' of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower lamella with an air-space in between. The surface towards the body is smooth and known as the inferior lamella. The upper surface, or superior lamella, has transverse and longitudinal ridges and ribs. The lamellae are held apart by struts called trabaculae and contain pigments which give colour. The scales cling somewhat loosely to the wing and <b>come</b> <b>off</b> easily without harming the butterfly.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, Manning {{began the}} season as the third-string quarterback. In the season opener against UCLA, Manning {{was one of three}} quarterbacks to <b>come</b> <b>off</b> the bench after starter Jerry Colquitt {{suffered}} a season-ending injury on the seventh play of the game. However, Manning was not able to generate any offense and was pulled from the game. During the season's fourth game, against Mississippi State, starter Todd Helton got injured and Manning took over. The Vols lost 24–21, but Manning was named the team's starter and remained so {{for the rest of his}} college career. In his first start, the following week against Washington State, the Vols won 10–9. They won all but one of their remaining games, finishing the season 8–4 with a 45–23 victory over Virginia Tech in the 1994 Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Garfield {{administration}} assumed office in 1881, the Navy's condition had deteriorated still further. A review conducted {{on behalf of the}} new Secretary of the Navy, William H. Hunt, found that of 140 vessels on the Navy's active list, only 52 were in an operational state, of which a mere 17 were iron-hulled ships, including 14 aging Civil War era ironclads. Hunt recognized the necessity of modernizing the Navy, and set up an informal advisory board to make recommendations. Also to be expected, morale was considerably down; officers and sailors in foreign ports were all too aware that their old wooden ships would not survive long in the event of war. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the United States from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the United States would have <b>come</b> <b>off</b> badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the round}} of 16 match against Uruguay, which Italy won 2–0, Baggio started the play which led to Italy's first goal, scored by Schillaci. Baggio also scored a goal from a direct free-kick, but it was {{disallowed}} as the referee had awarded an indirect free-kick. Baggio also had a goal incorrectly ruled offside in the quarter-final against the Republic of Ireland, which Italy won 1–0; Baggio was once again involved in the build-up which led to Schillaci's match winning goal. Italy were eliminated on penalties against defending champions Argentina in the semi-finals after a 1–1 draw, although Baggio was able to score his penalty in the shootout. Baggio had <b>come</b> <b>off</b> the bench {{in the second half}} for Giannini, and came close to winning the match with a free-kick, but it was saved by Sergio Goycochea.|$|E
5|$|McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and Airbus A310-300s made {{up most of}} Biman's {{international}} fleet, {{before the}} delivery of the modern Boeing 777-300ERs started in 2011. Fokker F28s made up {{the remainder of the}} fleet for the domestic and regional sectors, before they were retired in 2012. Biman's fleet contains the second-to-last Douglas DC–10 to <b>come</b> <b>off</b> the production line (l/n 445), and only three other Airbus A310–300s were produced following Biman's purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996. The two Fokker F28–4000s were acquired from PBair in 2004 at a cost of $2.91million. Both of these aircraft were built in 1977, making Biman's latest acquisitions the oldest aircraft in its fleet. The ageing fleet made it difficult for Biman to maintain its flight schedule, as the aircraft suffered from mechanical problems, leading to flight delays and cancellations. A number of aircraft remained grounded owing to lack of spare parts as they are no longer manufactured and used parts are difficult to source.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 2007, it was {{announced}} that a bid from Sunderland had been accepted by Stoke, after Higginbotham had handed a transfer request to the club. Higginbotham wrote in his autobiography that Pulis would only authorise the deal if he handed in a transfer request. Higginbotham signed a four-year deal with Sunderland the following day, moving for a £2.5million fee, possibly rising to £3million dependent on appearances. He said that the chance to play Premier League football under Roy Keane was too good to refuse. On 10 November 2007, Higginbotham scored the opening goal for Sunderland which was believed to <b>come</b> <b>off</b> his ear in a 1–1 draw with their Tyne-Wear rivals Newcastle United at the Stadium of Light. He was only a bit-part player by the start of 2008–09, and Keane allowed him to return to Stoke for the same fee that he had paid to Stoke.|$|E

On November 13, he posted 11 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves. On November 21, he scored a career-high 17 points off the bench and was 4-of-4 from three-point range against the Milwaukee Bucks. On December 27, he was {{assigned}} to the Fort Wayne Mad Ants of the NBA Development League. He was recalled the next day.

5|$|The Eighth Army telephoned Colonel Ernest V. Holmes, Chief of Staff of the 1st Cavalry Division, {{and told}} him that the 1st Cavalry Division had {{responsibility}} for the Walled City.

Holley, commanding officer of the 8th Engineer Combat Battalion, to report to Colonel Raymond D. Palmer, commanding the 8th Cavalry Regiment. That afternoon Palmer in his command post on the Tabu-dong road outlined to Holley and the commanding officers of D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion, and E Company, 8th Cavalry, his attack plan to regain control of Ka-san. The Engineer company, commanded by First Lieutenant John T. Kennedy, was to lead the attack, E Company following. Once the force had gained the crest and E Company had established itself in defensive positions, the Engineer company was to <b>come</b> <b>off</b> the mountain. Many of the men in D Company were veteran infantrymen who had fought in World War II.|$|E
5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is certainly no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever <b>come</b> <b>off</b> on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E
