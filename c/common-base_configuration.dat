The power gain relations and stability factors are derived from the modelled S-parameters which are computed at a fixed bias point from the small-signal hybrid-&# 8719; model of SiGe HBT in both configurations.

40|$|Two {{chemical}} sensors {{based on the}} common principle of infrared spectroscopyusing thulium doped zirconium fluoride glass and quantum cascade lasers are described. Exploiting optically absorbing molecular vibrations, IR optical sensors offer highly selective in situ sensing in compact packages. The near infrared (NIR) fluorescence of the thulium doped zirconium fluoride (ZBLAN:Tm 3 +) glass was characterised. A relative humidity sensor was developed using ZBLAN:Tm 3 + fluorescence as a modulatable infrared spectroscopic source. The optical components, NIR detector, and detector electronics were integrated in an industrial prototype device. Relative humidity measurements were carried out to characterise the sensor. Two quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) were used for sensing a number of analytes in the mid infrared (MIR,) spectral range in a <b>common-base</b> optical <b>configuration.</b> The first laser, a distributed feedback device emitting at 6 /im, was integrated into a silver halide optical fibre and a hollow waveguide, for liquid water and gaseous propylene sensing, respectively. The second laser, a Fabry-Perot device emitting at 5. 625 /im, was used for acetone, acetic acid and formaldehyde sensing using open path optical cells and a hollow waveguide.

40|$|Figure 1 shows a {{single-stage}} monolithic microwave {{integrated circuit}} (MMIC) power amplifier {{in which the}} gain element is a double-heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) connected in <b>common-base</b> <b>configuration.</b> This amplifier, which has been demonstrated to function well at a frequency of 172 GHz, is part of a continuing effort to develop compact, efficient amplifiers for scientific instrumentation, wide-band communication systems, and radar systems that will operate at frequencies up to and beyond 180 GHz. The transistor is fabricated from a layered structure formed by molecular beam epitaxy in the InP/InGaAs material system. A highly doped InGaAs base layer and a collector layer are fabricated from the layered structure in a triple mesa process. The transistor includes two separate emitter fingers, each having dimensions of 0. 8 by 12 m. The <b>common-base</b> <b>configuration</b> was chosen for its high maximum stable gain in the frequency band of interest. The input-matching network is designed for high bandwidth. The output of the transistor is matched to a load line for maximum saturated output power under large-signal conditions, rather than being matched for maximum gain under small-signal conditions. In a test at a frequency of 172 GHz, the amplifier was found to generate an output power of 7. 5 mW, with approximately 5 dB of large-signal gain (see Figure 2). Moreover, the amplifier exhibited a peak small-signal gain of 7 dB at a frequency of 176 GHz. This performance of this MMIC single-stage amplifier containing only a single transistor represents a significant advance {{in the state of the}} art, in that it rivals the 170 -GHz performance of a prior MMIC three-stage, four-transistor amplifier. [The prior amplifier was reported in "MMIC HEMT Power Amplifier for 140 to 170 GHz" (NPO- 30127), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 27, No. 11 (November 2003), page 49. ] This amplifier is the first heterojunction- bipolar-transistor (HBT) amplifier built for medium power operation in this frequency band. The performance of the amplifier as measured in the aforementioned tests suggests that InP/InGaAs HBTs may be superior to high-electron-mobility (HEMT) transistors in that the HBTs may offer more gain per stage and more output power per transistor...|$|E
40|$|Limited by {{increased}} parasitics and thermal effects as the device size becomes large, current commercial SiGe power HBTs {{are difficult to}} operate at X-band (8 - 12 GHz) with adequate power added efficiencies at high power levels. We found that, by changing the heterostructure and doping profile of SiGe HBTs, their power gain can be significantly improved without resorting to substantial lateral scaling. Furthermore, employing a <b>common-base</b> <b>configuration</b> with proper doping profile instead of a common-emitter configuration improves the power gain characteristics of SiGe HBTs, which thus permits these devices to be efficiently operated at X-band. In this paper, we report the results of SiGe power HBTs and MMIC power amplifiers operating at 8 - 10 GHz. At 10 GHz, 22. 5 dBm (178 mW) RF output power with concurrent gain of 7. 32 dB is measured at the peak power-added efficiency of 20. 0 % and the maximum RF output power of 24. 0 dBm (250 mW) is achieved from a 20 emitter finger SiGe power HBT. Demonstration of single-stage X-band medium-power linear MMIC power amplifier is also realized at 8 GHz. Employing a 10 -emitter finger SiGe HBT and on-chip input and output matching passive components, a linear gain of 9. 7 dB, a {{maximum output power of}} 23. 4 dBm and peak power added efficiency of 16 % is achieved from the power amplifier.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{demand for}} broadband {{capacity of the}} global optical communication networks puts enormous requirements on the semiconductor laser used in the optical transmitter. Industrial standard bodies for optical communication project requirements of single-channel data rates as high as 100 Gbit/s around year 2020. This is a significant step with respect to today's technology which is only at the verge of introducing 25 Gbit/s emitters. The preferred light source for these applications is the vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) which can offer cost- and power-efficient directly modulated operation. However, it has proven extremely difficult to push the modulation bandwidth of VCSELs beyond 30 GHz and radically new device concepts are demanded to meet the upcoming needs. One such new device paradigm consists of the transistor laser which is the fusion of a semiconductor laser and a high-speed heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) into a single device, with potential significant advantages in modulation bandwidth, noise properties and novel functionality {{by virtue of the}} three-terminal configuration. The present thesis deals with the design, fabrication and analysis of vertical-cavity surface-emitting transistor-lasers (T-VCSELs), a device previously not realized or investigated in great detail. GaAs-based T-VCSELs are investigated both theoretically and experimentally. A three-dimensional model is set up with a commercial software package and used for performance predictions and analysis as well as design and optimization purposes. It is concluded that a T-VCSEL biased in the <b>common-base</b> <b>configuration</b> may have a bandwidth surpassing those of conventional diode-type VCSELs or a T-VCSEL itself in the common-emitter configuration. Fabricated T-VCSELs make use of an epitaxial regrowth design to homogeneously integrate an AlGaAs/GaAs HBT and an InGaAs/GaAs VCSEL. An intracavity contacting scheme involving all three terminals, undoped distributed Bragg reflectors and modulation doping are used to ensure a low-loss laser structure. The first generation of devices showed sub-mA range base threshold current in combination with a high output power close to 2 mW but did not fulfill the requirements for a fully operational transistor laser since the transistor went into saturation before the onset of lasing (IBsat<IBth). From numerical simulations this premature saturation was demonstrated being due to a lateral potential variation within the device and large voltage drops along the base and collector regions. As a remedy to this problem the base region was redesigned for a reduced resistance and transistor current gain, and the saturation current could thereby be extended well beyond threshold. These devices showed excellent transistor-laser characteristics with clear gain-compression at threshold, mA-range base threshold current, mW-range output power, high-temperature operation to at least 60 °C, low collector-emitter offset voltage and record-low power dissipation during lasing. Furthermore, the collector-current breakdown characteristics was investigated in some detail and it is concluded that this, in contrast to previous models, presumably not is due to an intracavity photon reabsorption process but rather to a quantum-well band-filling effect.
