25|$|The <b>Cable</b> <b>Route</b> {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Cable</b> <b>Route</b> can be crowded. In past years, {{as many as}} 1,000 hikers per {{day have}} {{sometimes}} climbed the dome on a summer weekend, and about 50,000 hikers climb it every year.|$|E
25|$|Since 2011, all hikers who {{intend to}} ascend the <b>Cable</b> <b>Route</b> must now obtain permits before {{entering}} the park. Permits are checked by a ranger on the trail, and no hikers without permits are allowed to hike beyond {{the base of the}} sub-dome or {{to the bottom of the}} cables. Hikers caught bypassing the rangers to visit either the sub-dome or main dome without a permit face fines of up to $5,000 and/or 6 months in jail.|$|E
50|$|Spur tunnels, 5 ft (1.5 m) in diameter, {{were built}} to provide {{protected}} <b>cable</b> <b>routes</b> {{to the major}} service buildings either side of Whitehall.|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of {{concrete}} repeater stations remain along the <b>cable's</b> <b>route</b> {{as a reminder of}} its past role, for example, at Sutton Forrest, Wollogorang, Collector and Wallaroo.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} symbol {{used for}} a submarine branching unit in maps of <b>cable</b> <b>routes</b> is a small equilateral triangle with (usually) one vertex pointing towards {{the top of the}} map.|$|R
2500|$|Oyster {{cards are}} {{accepted}} on the Emirates Air Line <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> between Greenwich Peninsula and Royal Docks. [...] The Emirates Air Line is {{outside of the}} London Travelcard validity. However, a 25% discount applies to Travelcard and Freedom Pass holders for both single and return journeys. The discount is automatically applied to Oyster card users, but only if their Travelcard is loaded onto their Oyster card. Freedom Pass holders and visitors in possession of ordinary magnetic stripe Travelcards {{have to buy a}} cash ticket if they wish {{to take advantage of the}} discount.|$|E
2500|$|The final [...] ascent is steeply up {{the rock}} between two steel cables used as handholds. The cables are fixed with bolts {{in the rock}} and raised onto a series of metal poles in late May (the poles do not anchor the cables). The cables are taken down from the poles for the winter in early October, {{but they are still}} fixed to the rock surface and can be used. The National Park Service {{recommends}} against climbing the route when the cables are down and when the surface of the rock is wet and slippery. The <b>Cable</b> <b>Route</b> is rated class 3, while the same face away from the cables is rated class 5.|$|E
2500|$|The Half Dome <b>Cable</b> <b>Route</b> hike {{runs from}} the valley floor {{to the top of}} the dome in [...] (via the Mist Trail), with [...] of {{elevation}} gain. The length and difficulty of the trail used to keep it less crowded than other park trails, but in recent years the trail traffic has grown to as many as 800 people a day. The hike can be done from the valley floor in a single long day, but many people break it up by camping overnight in Little Yosemite Valley. The trail climbs past Vernal and Nevada Falls, then continues into Little Yosemite Valley, then north to the base of the northeast ridge of Half Dome itself.|$|E

50|$|Cable {{management}} both {{supports and}} contains cables during installation, and makes subsequent maintenance or {{changes to the}} cable system easier.

50|$|Use {{heavy-gauge}} conductors - Up to 19 gauge (approximately {{the gauge}} of pencil lead), which is costly and bulky. The heavy-gauge cables yielded far fewer pairs per cable {{and led to}} early congestion in <b>cable</b> <b>routes,</b> especially in bridge crossings and other areas of limited space.|$|R
50|$|To {{further reduce}} latency, new {{technologies}} are being employed. Wireless data transmission technology can offer speed advantages over the best cabling options, as signals can travel faster through air than fiber. Wireless transmission can also allow data {{to move in}} a straighter, more direct path than <b>cabling</b> <b>routes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Later, as captain, Halpin laid an {{estimated}} 26000 mi of cable (more {{than enough to}} circle the globe). The <b>cable</b> <b>routes</b> included the French Transatlantic Cable from Brest to St. Pierre-Miquelon in 1866 (under the patronage of Julius Reuters), the 1869 Bombay-Aden-Suez cable, and the Australia-New Zealand-East Indies, Madras-Singapore-Penang, and Madeira-Brazil.|$|R

50|$|The {{proposed}} onshore <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> {{consisted of}} around 63 km of underground cable - {{a number of}} interested parties raised concerns about the <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> and windfarm: farmers and the NFU raised concerns about its affects on drainage; and Lincoln City Council claimed the development would have a negative affect of tourism; Lincolnshire County Council raised concerns about the combined environmental impact of the onshore link together with the Viking Link electrical connector to Denmark.|$|E

50|$|Costs {{vary widely}} {{depending}} on {{the specifics of the}} project (such as power rating, circuit length, overhead vs. <b>cabled</b> <b>route,</b> land costs, and AC network improvements required at either terminal). A detailed comparison of DC vs. AC transmission costs may be required in situations where there is no clear technical advantage to DC, and economical reasoning alone drives the selection.|$|R
50|$|The planned export <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> {{crossed a}} number of {{pre-existing}} cables and pipelines: a set of pipelines related to the Liverpool Bay oil and gas field, connecting the Douglas Complex to landfall were crossed in the Mid-Hoyle channel the export <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> also ran close to the North Hoyle Offshore Wind Farm export cable; and crossed the 500 MW East-West Interconnector, {{as well as the}} planned route of the 2000 MW Western HVDC Link.|$|E
5000|$|NorGer {{interconnector}} {{will start}} in Tonstad in Norway. From Tonstad 70 km overhead powerline {{runs to the}} Flekkefjord area. From Flekkefjord a 570 km long high voltage direct current submarine cable will run through the North Sea to Mooriem in Lower Saxony, Germany. [...] It will be laid on the Norwegian, German and Danish Continental Shelf. The precise <b>cable</b> <b>route</b> is decided from a thorough mapping of the sea-bed along the prospective <b>cable</b> <b>route.</b> The sea route is consulted by Offshore Marine Management.|$|E

State of the art technology when the first line opened in 1882, by 1900 electric traction had proven superior and in 1906 all <b>cable</b> <b>routes</b> were changed to electrical power.

50|$|SAex (South Atlantic Express) is a {{proposed}} submarine communications cable that will link South Africa and Angola to Brazil, with onward connectivity to the United States.
