5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Chris tells Ben {{they have}} been called back to Indianapolis for a new assignment, but both agree to seek an {{extension}} to stay in Pawnee longer. Although both <b>claim</b> <b>they</b> want to help organize the Harvest Festival, it is hinted they really want to stay because of Leslie and Ann.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} part of the area of operations around Stolac, the situation was significantly calmer than around Nevesinje, although a group of 200 Ustaše at Berkovići were falsely claiming that they were being surrounded by rebels at night. Despite this <b>claim,</b> <b>they</b> had suffered no casualties. Regardless, Prpić sent them ammunition and a platoon of the 18th Battalion. At 19:00 on 26 June, Francetić arrived at Prpić's headquarters in Mostar to be briefed on the situation. He resolved that he would travel to Berkovići the following day and take personal command of the Ustaše unit there.|$|E
5|$|Scholars however concur {{that the}} rulers of the {{imperial}} dynasty in the 8th to 10th century made the Kannada language as important as Sanskrit. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use both Kannada and Sanskrit (historians Sheldon Pollock and Jan Houben <b>claim</b> <b>they</b> are mostly in Kannada), and the rulers encouraged literature in both languages. The earliest existing Kannada literary writings are credited to their court poets and royalty. Though these Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas, they were conversant in a northern Deccan language as well.|$|E
2500|$|Coutu {{signed on}} to a 2010 {{resolution}} denouncing federal mandates, <b>claiming</b> <b>they</b> [...] "squeezed budgets of cities and towns" [...] and <b>claiming</b> <b>they</b> contravened the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|R
50|$|On 8 January, clashes erupted at the {{university}} campus in Kufra, leaving two or three killed, with the local council <b>claiming</b> <b>they</b> were unknown armed militants shot by troops, while the Toubou community <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> were Toubou civilians assassinated by Zway militiamen.|$|R
25|$|The Tonkawa hired {{legal counsel}} and <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> had been {{pressured}} into signing the agreement, under {{the threat that}} all their allotments would be canceled if they failed to capitulate. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> had demanded $1.25 per acre. Congress failed to act on their claim.|$|R
5|$|We've {{always thought}} Lutz {{was the first}} one to sell it. But it's like how people <b>claim</b> <b>they</b> saw Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or were at Woodstock. The {{landscape}} is littered with salesmen who say, 'Oh yeah, I {{was the first one}} to bring that in.' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder {{arrives in}} the fields, he {{inadvertently}} drives over a patch of mushrooms which releases a cloud of hallucinogenic spores. Mulder—unbeknownst to the viewer—begins to hallucinate. He soon discovers Wallace and Angela in a cave, and the two <b>claim</b> <b>they</b> were abducted by aliens, who covered up their disappearance with false skeletons. Later, Scully arrives at Mulder's apartment and he explains to Scully what happened. He shows her an alien that he captured at Brown Mountain. Scully, however, accepts his reasoning without question and Mulder begins to doubt his surroundings. Eventually, after seeing the yellow substance, much like Angela saw, Mulder awakens in the cave he followed Wallace into earlier, covered in the yellow secretion, being digested alive.|$|E
5|$|From 1911 to 1917, {{money was}} {{collected}} for interior furnishings, which were relatively sparse {{apart from the}} impressive main altar. (These original furnishings remained until the 1930s.) Parts of the draft plan were abandoned: the floor was not constructed from marble as intended, but poured from plain concrete; outside there were no pinnacles on the façade. Writings vary on when the pinnacles were built: some <b>claim</b> <b>they</b> were built in 1923, but others argue {{that they were not}} completed until the renovation of the cathedral in 1999. Observers that argue for an earlier construction date state that they were damaged during World WarII and left dismantled for some time.|$|E

5000|$|The kabane {{were divided}} into two general classes: those who <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> were {{descendants}} of the imperial line (kōbetsu (...) [...] ), and those who <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> were descendants of the gods (shinbetsu (...) [...] ). There is often no historical evidence for such distinctions beside old records and other transmissions.|$|R

The government <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> were ordinary citizens while the FSA and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> were pro-government militiamen.|$|R
5|$|Quatermass {{returns to}} the Rocket Group, where Leo has reconstructed the meteorite, which can carry ammonia and other gases and travel through the {{atmosphere}} {{to the ground in}} one piece. In London, the Metropolitan Police <b>claim</b> <b>they</b> have no jurisdiction over the matter, so he goes to his contact Fowler at the ministry, who reveals that the plant is a top secret project to make synthetic food, but Vincent Broadhead MP, who is conducting an inquiry into the project, reveals that there are identical plants in Brazil and Siberia. Upon gaining entry to the inquiry, Quatermass notices that one of the civil servants has 'the mark'.|$|E
5|$|While the {{northern}} origin {{theory has been}} dismissed by many historians, the epigraphist K. V. Ramesh has suggested that an earlier southern migration is a distinct possibility which needs examination. According to him, the complete absence of any inscriptional reference of their family connections to Ayodhya, and their subsequent Kannadiga identity {{may have been due}} to their earlier migration into present day Karnataka region where they achieved success as chieftains and kings. Hence, the place of origin of their ancestors may have been of no significance to the kings of the empire who may have considered themselves natives of the Kannada speaking region. The writing of 12th century Kashmiri poet Bilhana suggests the Chalukya family belonged to the Shudra caste while other sources <b>claim</b> <b>they</b> were Kshatriyas.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to <b>claim,</b> <b>they</b> fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
