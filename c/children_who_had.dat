40|$|REVIEW QUESTION / OBJECTIVE The {{objective}} of this review is to identify and synthesize the best international qualitative evidence on healthcare users’ experiences of communication with healthcare professionals about <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions. For {{the purposes of this}} review, “healthcare users” will be taken to include <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions and their families. The question to be addressed is: - What are healthcare users’ experiences of communicating with healthcare professionals about <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions? INCLUSION CRITERIA - Types of participants: This review will consider all qualitative studies that focus on users of healthcare services for <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions. These users are anticipated to include <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a life-limiting condition and their family members. In instances where children are not under the legal care of one or both parents, service users may also include other types of legal guardians. - Phenomena of interest: This review will consider experiences of communicating with healthcare professionals about <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> life-limiting conditions. - Context: This review will consider studies relating to communication with healthcare professionals about <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a life-limiting condition, irrespective of whether the healthcare service is based in a hospital, hospice, or community setting.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the use of Developmental Transformations (DvT) with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{suffered}} from physical abuse. Certain mindfulness practices, such as being present and attending to the sensations experienced within that moment, seem to be embedded within various DvT interventions and techniques. Nevertheless, mindfulness-based treatments do not include the concept of ‘play’, which is a key feature of DvT and can be very useful when working with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been physically abused. Play can help children explore personal material which may otherwise be difficult to discuss. DvT possesses many of the necessary techniques required to work with <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been physically abused.

The Centre and the States have agreed to share the financial burden in the ratio of 55:45, while the Finance Commission has given Rs.250billion to the States for implementing the Act. The Centre has approved an outlay of Rs.150billion for 2010–2011.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E

5|$|On 8 August 1993, Mills and Mincione {{walked to}} the corner of De Vere Gardens and Kensington Road, London, but while {{crossing}} Kensington Road, Mills was knocked down by a police motorcycle, the last in a convoy of three, which was responding to an emergency call. Mills suffered crushed ribs, a punctured lung, and the loss of her left leg 6inches below the knee; a metal plate was later attached to her pelvis. In October 1993, she had another operation that further shortened her leg. Mills was awarded £200,000 by the police authority as recompense for her injuries, even though the police motorcyclist, PC Osbourne, was later cleared by magistrates of driving without due care and attention. After the accident, Mills sold her story to the News of the World, and gave other interviews, saying she earned £180,000. She used the money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust (existed 2000–2004) which delivered prosthetic limbs to people, particularly <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> lost limbs after stepping on landmines. Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg, once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show Larry King Live, in 2002.|$|E

The events and subsequent Senate committee inquiries were widely reported, and the transcripts of the inquiry formed the basis of a play, A Certain Maritime Incident. Other high-profile inquiries included the Community Affairs committee's inquiry into Children in Institutional Care, which brought to wide public notice the experiences of <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been placed in care in sometimes inhumane circumstances and was directly responsible for state governments and churches making public apologies to the victims of abuse or neglect; the Select Committee on Mental Health, which contributed to widespread discussion of mental health issues and to a major funding boost for services in 2006; and the 2006 inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, which contributed to a government decision not to proceed with controversial migration legislation.|$|E
5|$|She Has a Name is a {{play about}} human {{trafficking}} written by Andrew Kooman in 2009 as a single act and expanded to full length in 2010. It is about the trafficking of children into sexual slavery and {{was inspired by the}} deaths of 54 people in the Ranong human-trafficking incident. Kooman had previously published literature, but this was his first full-length play. The stage premiere of She Has a Name was directed by Stephen Waldschmidt in Calgary, Alberta in February 2011. From May to October 2012, She Has a Name toured across Canada. In conjunction with the tour, A Better World raised money to help women and <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been trafficked in Thailand as part of the country's prostitution industry. The first performances of She Has a Name in the United States took place in Folsom, California in 2014 under the direction of Emma Eldridge, who was a 23-year-old college student at the time.|$|E

30|$|We {{will assume}} that origin countries’ {{educational}} systems affect migrant children’s educational outcome in their destination country {{only if they}} have received part of their education in their origin country. So, we do not expect direct effects of origin countries’ education systems for the scholastic performance of second-generation migrant <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> are born in a country to which their parents migrated. Moreover, the more time first generation migrant children have received education in their origin country, the more relevant the education system of the origin country will be. Rumbaut (2004) has shown that educational performance of first generation migrant children differs extensively between <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> migrated {{at an early age}} and <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> migrated later in life. Following Rumbaut’s (ibid.) terminology, we distinguish between first generation <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> migrated before the age of 5, <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> migrated between the age of 5 and 12, and pupils who migrated after the age of 12.|$|R

The Cottage began as a collection of smaller games the three had previously developed on their own, with the player moving through an amusement arcade to choose what to play; as they found it more fun to move through the arcade than to play the games, they ended up expanding the area to explore and removing most of the smaller games. Several thousand copies of the IBM PC release were sold; despite this, the developers did not receive much money from it outside of pre-paid royalties. The game had a cult-like status among Oden users at the time, and was commercially important to the computer center in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accession}} in Great Britain, George's {{relationship with}} his son (which had always been poor) worsened. George Augustus, Prince of Wales, encouraged opposition to his father's policies, including measures designed to increase religious freedom in Britain and expand Hanover's German territories {{at the expense of}} Sweden. In 1717 the birth of a grandson led to a major quarrel between George and the Prince of Wales. The King, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The King was angered when the Prince of Wales, disliking Newcastle, verbally insulted the Duke at the christening, which the Duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel. The Prince was told to leave the royal residence, St. James's Palace. The Prince's new home, Leicester House, became a meeting place for the King's political opponents. George and his son were later reconciled at the insistence of Robert Walpole and the desire of the Princess of Wales, who had moved out with her husband but missed her <b>children</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been left in the care of the King. However, following the quarrel at the baptism, father and son would never again be on cordial terms.|$|E
