5|$|Locusts {{have formed}} plagues since prehistory. The Ancient Egyptians carved {{them on their}} tombs and the insects are {{mentioned}} in the Iliad, the Bible and the Quran. Swarms have devastated crops and been a contributory cause of famines and human migrations. More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of locations where swarms tend to originate, have meant that control measures can be used at an early stage. The traditional means of <b>control</b> <b>are</b> based {{on the use of}} insecticides from the ground or the air, but other methods using biological <b>control</b> <b>are</b> proving effective.|$|E

3000|$|An {{extreme case}} of {{intermittent}} <b>control</b> <b>is</b> impulsive <b>control</b> which has <b>been</b> gained increasing interest and intensively researched [33, 34]. The prominent characteristic of impulsive <b>control</b> <b>is</b> {{that the states}} of controlled system will [...] "jump" [...] at certain discrete time moments, namely, the <b>control</b> <b>is</b> with zero duration of time. Because the states of <b>controlled</b> systems <b>are</b> changed directly, impulsive <b>control</b> <b>is</b> an effective approach when the states are observable, {{but it seems to}} be invalid when the states of <b>controlled</b> systems <b>are</b> unobservable.|$|R

5|$|Predators {{are mainly}} {{free-living}} species that directly consume {{a large number}} of prey during their whole lifetime. Given that many major crop pests are insects, many of the predators used in biological <b>control</b> <b>are</b> insectivorous species. Lady beetles, and in particular their larvae which are active between May and July in the northern hemisphere, are voracious predators of aphids, and also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The spotted lady beetle (Coleomegilla maculata) is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).|$|E
5|$|Teenage pregnancies, {{especially}} among younger teens, are {{at greater risk}} of adverse outcomes including early birth, low birth weight, and death of the infant. In the United States 82% of pregnancies in those between 15 and 19 are unplanned. Comprehensive sex education and access to birth <b>control</b> <b>are</b> effective in decreasing pregnancy rates in this age group.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} distinction within self-control, between {{stop control}} and start <b>control,</b> <b>was</b> investigated in two studies.

5|$|In {{cases of}} massive and severe {{infection}} of invasive pests, techniques of pest <b>control</b> <b>are</b> {{often used in}} combination. An example is the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, an invasive beetle from China, which has destroyed {{tens of millions of}} ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely Tetrastichus planipennisi, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, Oobius agrili, a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and Spathius agrili, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States of America as a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer. Initial results for Tetrastichus planipennisi have shown promise, and it is now being released along with Beauveria bassiana, a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} methods of birth <b>control</b> <b>are</b> sterilization {{by means of}} vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control. This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex. Some argue not having sex as a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.|$|E
5|$|Thedas is a {{world in}} which race and class combine to {{determine}} social class. Elves are often viewed as second-class citizens by humans, while human nobles are treated with respect. Mages, on the other hand, are cloistered by the Chantry: they have access to the Fade, the unconscious realm that is the home of spirits, and a single lapse in vigilance could cause them to be possessed by demons. Apostate mages, who live outside the Chantry's <b>control,</b> <b>are</b> considered extremely dangerous, and the Chantry has a militant wing, the Templars, to seek them out and subdue them by any means necessary. Dwarves live in the Deep Roads, their kingdom a shadow of what it once was before the first Blight. Their society is rooted in tradition and a rigid caste system.|$|E
50|$|Decentralized {{control or}} market <b>control</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} maintained through {{factors such as}} price, competition, or market share.
