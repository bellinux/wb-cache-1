25|$|Routing {{and milling}} are conceptually similar, and end mills {{can be used}} in routers, but routing wood is {{different}} from milling metal in terms of the mechanics involved; the chip formation is different, and the optimal tool geometry is thus different. Routing is properly applied to relatively weak and brittle materials, typically wood. As these materials are weak in small sections, routers may be run at extremely high speeds and so even a small router may cut rapidly. Owing to inertia at these high speeds, the normal wood <b>cutting</b> <b>mechanism</b> of Type I chips cannot take place. The cutter edge angle is blunt, approaching 90°, and so a Type III chip is formed, with the waste material being produced as fine dust. This dust is a respiratory hazard, even in benign materials.

30|$|The nanometric <b>cutting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{typically}} include elastic {{and plastic}} deformation of work piece material, friction and wear, machining forces, formation of machined surface and chip, etc. Since the nanometric cutting process is inherently discrete rather than continuous {{because of its}} ultra-small nominal depth of cut, which is of a few atomic layers, the experimental investigation of the nanometric <b>cutting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is severely limited by the resolution of machining and measurement equipments, and the theoretical study based on the continuum mechanics such as finite element method cannot {{be used for the}} analysis of nanometric cutting process. Molecular dynamics (MD) has been demonstrated as one powerful tool for elucidating the nanometric <b>cutting</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> because it can trace the trajectories of individual atoms at a very short time step through the time integration of Newton's second law, which enables the monitoring of ongoing nanometric cutting process. Furthermore, workpiece with different microstructures and dimensions, as well as cutting tool with different geometries, can be constructed easily through modeling; and the machining parameters such as nominal depth of cut and cutting velocity can be adjusted conveniently for each nanometric cutting simulation. In the past few decades, many researchers have employed MD simulation to investigate the nanometric <b>cutting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> [4 – 10], and some typical work is outlined as follows. Komanduri et al. carried out MD simulations to analyze the effects of tool cutting edge radius and depth of cut in nanometric cutting [4]. Pei et al. further investigated the influence of rake angle on the nanometric cutting of copper [5]. Lai et al. studied the phase transformation during nanometric cutting of germanium [6].

30|$|The {{previous}} works have provided valuable {{insights into the}} nanometric <b>cutting</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> However, less {{attention has been paid}} to the influence of workpiece materials' properties on the nanometric cutting. It is well known that the nanometric cutting is a highly coupled process between workpiece material and cutting tool, because of the comparable edge radius of cutting tool with the nominal depth of cut. Consequently, the workpiece materials' properties may play a crucial role in the nanometric cutting process, in addition to the geometry of cutting tool. On the other side, it has been demonstrated that by alloying with aluminum, the properties and subsequent deformation behavior of copper can be significantly changed [11]. Thus, it is interesting to know whether the nanometric <b>cutting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are also different for workpiece materials with different properties. In the current study, we perform MD simulations of nanometric cutting of single crystal aluminum and copper, which have the same face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice structure but different material properties.|$|R

40|$|This thesis has {{investigated}} material removal mechanisms in grinding by considering single grit workpiece interaction. The investigation was performed both experimentally and using finite element simulation. Rubbing, ploughing and <b>cutting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> occurring during the grinding process were {{studied at the}} micro scale. Due to its nature the rubbing phase occurs in a very narrow region of grit-workpiece engagement and is difficult to examine under a microscope and so was investigated using FEM simulation. The ploughing mechanism was thoroughly investigated using both experimental tests and FEM simulations, and a similar trend was observed for the pile up ratio along the scratch path from the experimental tests and the FEM simulations. Ploughing and <b>cutting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in grinding {{were found to be}} highly influenced by grit cutting edge shape, sharpness and bluntness. Cutting is the prominent mechanism when the grit cutting edge is sharp, but ploughing is more prominent when the grit cutting edge becomes flattened. In the case of multiple edges scratch formation, ploughing is dramatically increased compared to single edge scratches. Feasibility of ground surface simulation using FEM is demonstrated using multiple pass scratch formation in a cross direction. Although chip formation mechanism is developed at a relatively higher depth of cut (greater than 10 μm), at small scales down to 1 μm, FEM simulation was not a suitable method to use. To reduce the drawbacks of FEM simulation in micro scale cutting, a meshless simulation technique such as smooth particle hydrodynamics is recommended for future studies...|$|R
