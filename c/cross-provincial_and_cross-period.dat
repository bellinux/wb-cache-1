40|$|Consumer {{promotions}} are {{an important}} element of competitive dynamics in retail markets and make {{a significant difference in the}} retailer's profits. But no study has so far included all the elements that are required to meet retail business objectives. We extend the existing literatures by considering all the basic requirements for a promotional Decision Support System (DSS) : reliance on operational (store-level) data only, the ability to predict sales as a function of prices and the inclusion of other promotional variables affecting the category. The new model delivers an optimizing promotional schedule at Stock-Keeping-Unit (SKU) level which maximizes multi-period category level profit under the constraints of business rules typically applied in practice. We first develop a high dimensional distributed lag demand model which integrates both cross-SKU competitive promotion information <b>and</b> <b>cross-period</b> promotional influences. We estimate the model by proposing a two stage sign constrained regularization approach to ensure realistic promotional parameters. Based on the demand model, we then build a nonlinear integer programming model to maximize the retailer's category profits over a planning horizon under constraints that model important business rules. The output of the model provides optimized prices, display and feature advertising planning together with sales and profit forecasts. Empirical tests over a number of stores and categories using supermarket data suggest that our model generates accurate sales forecasts and increases category profits by approximately 17 % and that including cross-item <b>and</b> <b>cross-period</b> effects is also valuable...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{consider}} the future of Victorian literary studies within the long nineteenth century, we must {{go back to that}} earlier “period” of the nineteenth century, and the French Revolution of 1789. Drawing on the aesthetic and political innovations of 1790 s women's writings, this essay argues that we need to reconceive of nineteenth-century literary studies beyond the period boundaries of Romantic and Victorian. The sexualization of revolutionary Terror, and particularly of Robespierre, in Romantic-era writings by women like Helen Maria Williams, Mary Robinson and Fanny Burney, offers surprising precedents for the feminization of Terror associated with the retrospectives of Victorian writers like Carlyle and Dickens. In this respect, and given many other aesthetic continuities (for example, the crossgender <b>and</b> <b>cross-period</b> appeal of the “poetess” figure), the “Victorian period” appears increasingly unsatisfactory when compared to the merits of a long nineteenth-century model for literary studies...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} consideration for multi-channel grocery retailers is which promotion strategy to adopt across channels. The tendency of grocery buyers to keep visiting the offline store after {{they start to}} buy at the chain’s online store, implies that promotions in one channel can have substantial negative effects on buying behavior in the other channel, especially if the promotions differ across channels. This article examines the cross-channel effects of price promotions on category purchase decisions, taking into account both contemporaneous effects (during the promotion period) <b>and</b> <b>cross-period</b> effects (after the promotion period). For cross-period promotion effects, a distinction is made between lagged promotion effects on subsequent category purchases, and promotion frequency effects on future promotion effectiveness. The results show that (1) promotions in one channel can have negative effects on category purchases in the other channel during the promotion period, (2) these cross-channel effects are asymmetric, (3) high promotion frequency can have negative effects on future promotion effectiveness in the other channel, and (4) cross-channel effects are more negative for more loyal customers of the chain. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Sales {{promotions}} generate substantial short-term sales increases. To {{determine whether}} the sales promotion bump is truly beneficial from a managerial perspective, we propose a system of store-level regression models that decomposes the sales promotion bump into three parts: cross-brand effects (secondary demand), cross period effects (primary demand borrowed from other time periods), and category-expansion effects (remaining primary demand). Across four store-level scanner datasets, we find {{that each of these}} three parts contribute about one third on average. One extension we propose is the separation of the category-expansion effect into cross-store and market-expansion effects. Another one is to split the cross-item effect (total across all other items) into cannibalization and between-brand effects. We also allow for a flexible decomposition by allowing all effects to depend on the feature/display support condition and on the magnitude of the price discount. The latter dependence is achieved by local polynomial regression. We find that feature-supported price discounts are strongly associated with cross-period effects while display-only supported price discounts have especially strong category-expansion effects. While the role of the category-expansion effect tends to increase with higher price discounts, the roles of cross-brand <b>and</b> <b>cross-period</b> effects both tend to decrease...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{developments}} in humanistic geography, philosophy, and archaeology {{to develop a}} long-term place-centered theoretical perspective on monuments of the Roman Empire. The emphasis is on theory-building and {{an exploration of the}} implications of applying the proposed perspective, rather than a detailed case study of a particular Roman monument. It is argued that monuments and heritage sites are too frequently viewed as time capsules for which perceived significance derives from their original function and period of construction and primary use: the glory days effectively define the monument and set the parameters of present-day management, public presentation, and research agendas. Sites and monuments are often pigeon-holed, branded, and carefully circumscribed by chronological and thematic parameters that allow for simple and digestable messaging, but this practice establishes and reinforces a reductionist perspective in which only certain periods and functions are seen to really matter. The paper merges place theory and genealogy to propose and explore an alternative perspective that allows for the continued celebration of key episodes in a site’s life, but that also allows for the explicit recognition that significance is cumulative and changing, and that a wider range of activities, events, memories, and stories augment and enrich traditional period-limited views; such a perspective also provides opportunities for new research <b>and</b> cross-disciplinary <b>and</b> <b>cross-period</b> collaboration...|$|R

30|$|Without {{knowing the}} exact utility {{functions}} of customers, modelling customers’ responses to time-varying prices becomes important. Schweppe et al. [20] developed {{the concept of}} spot pricing of electricity where they envisaged a system wherein the spot prices change in real time, and customers can adjust their demand depending on the spot prices. Three responsive load models, namely, linear, exponential and potential demand functions are proposed. [21] indicated that the assumption that customers can reduce their loads indefinitely is unrealistic; instead, customers will attempt to shift their consumption to other periods. Therefore, {{the concept of the}} price-elasticity of demand is important for modelling responses. The influence of demand elasticity on the shape of the load curve has been addressed in the past works including the concepts of self-elasticity (the relation between demand and price in one time interval) and cross-elasticity (the relation between demand and price in different time intervals) [22, 23, 24, 25]. For instance, in [22], demand models were formulated as linear models, and the matrix of elasticities which includes all self-elasticities and cross-elasticities was evaluated. A demand responsive model was proposed in [23] based on price self-elasticity, which consists of four different demand functions, namely, linear, exponential, logarithmic and potential functions. An economic model for the demand response which can explain the change <b>and</b> <b>cross-period</b> shift in consumption pattern of customers is proposed in [25]. However, the above price elasticity based demand models are not ready for use in the pricing optimization problem. This is mainly {{due to the lack of}} market behavior constraints between the elasticities, which can lead to incorrect demand modelling where higher market prices lead to higher usages. Motivated by the above analysis, in this paper, we adopt a realistic demand model based on price elasticity including relevant market behavior constraints to be use in the pricing optimization model.|$|R
40|$|Discussion Paper 13 / 2003 The present paper {{examines}} new {{estimates of}} GDP {{for the five}} Nordic countries 1830 - 1910 {{in terms of economic}} growth and purchasing power parities. It concludes that significant economic growth took place during the period. The long-run growth was surprisingly even. However, up to the 1870 s this growth was strongest in Norway. From then on Sweden had fastest growth, when Norway experienced relative decline. PPP calculations of GDPs show that Denmark was best off of Nordic countries in the entire period. Norway was number two {{to the end of the}} nineteenth century, and then over taken by Sweden in the early 1900 s. Finland and Iceland obtained similar levels 1870 - 1910. Historical national accounts During the last decades Scandinavian economic historians have been in the forefront in constructing historical national accounts (HNA). Olle Krantz pioneered a Nordic project in 1994. The aim was to reach at common standards for the construction and presentation of HNA for the Nordic countries. By adopting common standards one will be able to carry out both cross-country <b>and</b> <b>cross-period</b> comparisons. The Finnish historical national accounts, constructed by Riitta Hjerppe, in many ways served as a standard for the other Nordic countries (Hjerppe 1989). By adopting modern standards with historical alterations the standards for the Nordic Historical National Accounts (NHNA) are closely related to the United Nations System of National Accounts from 1993 (SNA 93) and the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95) established by the Commission of the European Union and Eurostat. As result of the ongoing Nordic project, new series of HNA for the Nordic countries have been published. Gudmundur Jonsson has constructed a HNA for Iceland (HNI...|$|R

The incompetence shown {{by the government in}} providing relief, the corruption allegations in regards to those efforts, and government’s failure to prosecute corrupt officials and businessmen, further angered the public. How voters responded to these in the 2002 parliamentary election is investigated, using <b>cross-provincial</b> data, <b>and</b> controlling for other social, political and economic factors. Our results show that voters held accountable all of the political parties which participated in governments during the last decade or so, and not just the incumbents in 2002. The party in charge of the ministry responsible for earthquake relief, and parties that served longest and controlled more of the city administrations in the quake zone were blamed more. The newly formed Justice and Development Party (AKP) was the beneficiary of the votes lost by these parties. The sensitivity shown by the electorate to real and perceived corruption implies that corruption problem will be tractable in Turkey, and can be reduced through increased transparency and democratization.

30|$|Zhan’s and Hong’s {{articles}} constitute exceptions in {{the existing}} literature focusing on China’s resource curse. Their studies are conducted {{from the viewpoint of}} political science and fiscal sociology. By comparing two neighboring counties in Guizhou Province and employing cross-prefectural <b>and</b> <b>cross-provincial</b> panel datasets, Zhan and Hong find that resource abundance breeds corruption, decreases government spending on human capital accumulation, and increases the likelihood of social instability (Hong 2013; Zhan 2013, 2015; Zhan et al. 2015). However, these studies still have some drawbacks in their methodology, as does the previous research by economists. First, there are still many unmeasurable or uncontrollable factors in their models, such as institutional, cultural, social, and geographical factors, which may reduce the efficiency of the models. Second, varying kinds of resources like coal, petroleum, gas, and other hard-rock minerals are often mixed together to denote a simple independent variable, making it hard to clearly separate their individual contribution to the resource curse.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} in the West showing that return to work (RTW) coordination is a key element to facilitate RTW of injured workers and to prevent work disabilities. However, no study has been carried out to investigate the scope of RTW activities in China. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the views of key RTW stakeholders on necessary activities for RTW coordination. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Guangdong province of China. A three-tiered approach including focus group discussions and panel reviews was used to collect RTW activities, analyze the content validity, and classify domains. Descriptive statistics and intra-class correlation (ICC) were used to describe the importance of RTW activities and the degree of agreement on the classification of different domains. A Kruskal-Wallis test with subsequent post-hoc analysis using multiple Mann-Whitney U tests was carried out to check for any differences in the domains of different RTW activities among RTW stakeholders. Results The domains of RTW activities in China were similar to those in the West and included workplace assessment and mediation, social problem solving, role and liability clarification, and medical advice. Good agreement (ICC: 0. 729 - 0. 844) on the classification of RTW activities into different domains was found. The domains of the RTW activities of healthcare providers differed from those of employers (P = 0. 002) and injured workers (P = 0. 001). However, there was no significant difference between employers and injured workers. Conclusions This study indicated that differences among stakeholders were observed in terms of areas of relative priority. There is a clear need for research and training in China to establish a nation-wide terminology for RTW coordination, facilitate <b>cross-provincial</b> studies <b>and</b> work toward a more integrated system addressing the diverse perspectives of stakeholders involved in the RTW process.

40|$|This study {{tests the}} causal {{relationships}} between quality of governance {{and economic growth}} at the provincial level in China during the post-Mao reform era. Exploiting the wide <b>cross-provincial</b> variation <b>and</b> rapid change over time in governance institutions and economic performance in China during this period (covering 1985 – 2005), the study provides {{a new perspective on}} the relationship between governance and growth. Whereas a large body of prior literature has demonstrated a strong positive association between high-quality governance institutions and good economic performance at the cross-country level, few quantitative studies have explicitly tested the direction of causality between changes in governance quality and changes in economic outcomes. This study aims to address this gap in the literature by testing two causal hypotheses on the interplay between provincial-level governance and economic performance in China: (i) improvements in provincial quality of governance predict subsequent economic growth rates, and (ii) increases in provincial economic growth rates predict subsequent changes in quality of governance. Using new heterogeneous Granger causality tests that allow for potential differences in the causal relations across provinces, I show a significant and positive effect of economic growth on subsequent quality of governance, largely driven by growth in the secondary sector, but no significant effect of quality of governance on economic growth. These findings suggest that improvements in formal governance have not been a key factor driving China’s rapid growth; instead, the observed positive association between governance and growth reflects the ability of provincial governments to harness the potential created by economic growth to implement subsequent governance improvements. For researchers studying the effect of governance on growth, the results suggest that greater attention should be paid to possible reverse causality from economic outcomes to governance changes...|$|R
