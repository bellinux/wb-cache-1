The <b>charge</b> <b>structure</b> of GUTs is, however, not simple, and the five types of charge units appear. We investigate the problem of elementarity in taking into account of the simplest model of the <b>charge</b> <b>structure</b> known as the rishon model, where the charge units are known as 1 / 3 ($T$) and 0 ($V$). In order to approach to sub-structure together {{with the problem of}} simplicity of <b>charge</b> <b>structure,</b> possible rearrangements of rishons are investigated on the basis of color and hypercolor confinement condition. Further, possible existence of the simplest electroweak sub-structure is discussed. Our model predicts possible proton decay mode, in which $X$ and $Y$ bosons are not concerned.

40|$|This {{second part}} of a two-part study {{examines}} the lightning and <b>charge</b> <b>structure</b> evolution of the 29 June 2000 tornadic supercell observed during the Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study (STEPS). Data from the National Lightning Detection Network and the New Mexico Tech Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) are used to quantify the total and cloud-to-ground (CG) flash rates. Additionally, the LMA data are used to infer gross <b>charge</b> <b>structure</b> and to determine the origin locations and charge regions involved in the CG flashes. The total flash rate reached nearly 300 min � 1 and was well correlated with radar-inferred updraft and graupel echo volumes. Intracloud flashes accounted for 95 %– 100 % of the total lightning activity during any given minute. Nearly 90 % of the CG flashes delivered a positive charge to ground (�CGs). The <b>charge</b> <b>structure</b> during the first 20 min of this storm consisted of a midlevel negative charge overlying lower positive charge with no evidence of an upper positive <b>charge.</b> The <b>charge</b> <b>structure</b> in the later (severe) phase was more complex but maintained what could be roughly described as an inverted tripole, dominated by a deep midlevel (5 – 9 km MSL) region of positive charge.

The inductive charging process between graupel and cloud droplets exhibits a normal tripole <b>charge</b> <b>structure,</b> consisting of a lower positive charge region under the main negative charge region.

40|$|AbstractUsing {{the data}} from SAFIR 3000 {{lightning}} detection network and Doppler weather radar, the characteristics of lightning activity in a squall line on July 31, 2007 were analyzed. In this study, the lightning activity and inferred <b>charge</b> <b>structure</b> of squall line were obtained.

At the developing stage of squall line, the upper lightning radiation sources were centered at 11 km MSL, while the lower radiation sources were located at 4 km MSL. Assuming that the maximum lightning radiation sources were corresponding to the positive charge region, the squall line showed a dipole <b>charge</b> <b>structure</b> with an upper positive charge region and a lower negative charge region.
