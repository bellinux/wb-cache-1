40|$|European seed {{policies}} and legislation {{have contributed to}} fostering {{a system in which}} fewer varieties are traded in ever bigger markets in accordance with the law of economy of scale. Informal seed systems have been marginalised and perceived as outdated in a scenario in which the agricultural system was being modernised. In 1998, however, the European Union recognised the need to conserve agricultural genetic resources and created a catalogue specially for registering what it called ‘conservation varieties’. In June 2008 an EU Directive was issued regulating the agricultural species involved. So what is this ‘new’ category of variety. What impact will it have in supporting the informal conservation initiatives in agricultural biodiversity and making them legitimate? This article sets out to address these questions by analysing the concept of <b>conservation</b> <b>variety</b> from when the phrase was coined up to the recent European directive 62 / 2008. After describing and evaluating the impact that the directive may have, Italian regulation on conservation varieties will be analysed focusing on synergies and diversities. &# 13; Lastly, {{in the light of the}} International Treaty on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, attention will turn to the regulations in order to verify how they correspond...|$|E
40|$|Low {{productivity}} of groundnut-based systems, afl atoxin regulations, and stricter grades and standards have lowered {{the competitiveness of}} the West African groundnut in the domestic, regional and international markets. To regain its market, groundnut productivity has to increase through the adoption of new technologies {{and the development of}} sustainable seed systems. The availability and uptake of high quality seed by farmers is fundamental to the transformation of predominant traditional agricultural production practices to achieve increased stability and sustainable food production in West Africa. New seeds with higher yield potential or ability to relieve constraints faced by farmers in using traditional varieties form part of the improved inputs required to increase crop production. Previous support by the CFC and ICRISAT has been largely successful in germplasm <b>conservation,</b> <b>variety</b> maintenance and the development of appropriate groundnut varieties that meet farmers’ preferences and market requirements. Governments have attempted to develop seed multiplication and distribution schemes through state seed projects. However, in the light of increased liberalization of economies and structural adjustment policies, governments are disengaging from seed production and distribution activities. There is therefore a need to rethink alternative and sustainable arrangements for seed production and delivery schemes. This technical paper summarizes information on the structure, conduct and performance of formal and informal groundnut seed supply systems in the four countries of West Africa namely Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. It highlights a range of technical, socioeconomic, institutional and policy constraints facing the groundnut seed industry in West Africa. Low and inconsistent supply of breeder seed, poor seed demand estimation, lack of or non-functional national variety release committees, inappropriate institutional arrangements and the biological features of groundnut have limited the private sector entry and the performance of the groundnut seed industry. Options likely to be sustainable should focus on local village seed schemes whereas small-scale private seed entrepreneurs or community-based seed systems should be encouraged to become seed entrepreneurs or engaged in the seed industry. There is evidence of vertical integration between inputs and product markets. Appropriate linkages between seed and grain producers, and grain producers and processors are necessary to drive the private sector entry in the seed industry. It is our hope and expectation that this report will provide valuable information towards improving the performance of groundnut seed markets and offer alternative and sustainable seed multiplication and delivery options to smallholder farmers throughout Sub-Saharan Africa where the economies are still agriculture-dependen...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of traditional varieties of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) as sources of variation in breeding programs and varieties targeted to high-price quality markets that value their exceptional organoleptic quality, little is known regarding the structure of these materials at the morphological level. In this study, a collection of 166 populations (137 of them during two years) of traditional varieties of tomato from {{the east coast of}} Spain has been characterized using 41 descriptors. The characterization revealed a considerable variation. The segregation observed in several populations (28 %) suggests that apart from the configuration as population varieties, the high variation present in these landraces may be partially due to possible seed mixing and spontaneous cross-pollination. Only nine fruit descriptors were required to represent the variation present in the collection analyzed. It seems that after spontaneous cross-pollinations, farmers applied strong selection to a small number of traits, though even in these traits a high level of variation is maintained. The variation observed may hinder clear recognition by the consumer, an attribute required for the consolidation of quality markets. Additionally, a registry of these materials as <b>conservation</b> <b>varieties</b> would be complicated considering the actual levels of variation. Therefore, a varietal depuration would be interesting in order to promotein situ conservation of these resources. Finally, the high levels of variation in the intra-varietal scale may justify the collection and maintenance of more populations of the same variety as the risk of conserving duplicates would not be so high...|$|R

40|$|Communication le vendredi 20 juin 2008. Viable {{seeds for}} organic cultureThe {{currently}} established seed regulations {{conform to the}} dominant conception of the conventional agriculture industry, wherein the cultivated varieties answer to the criteria of DUS (Distinction, Uniformity, Stability) and the protocols of VCU (Value for Cultivation and Use). In 1998, the European Community established a directive – 98 / 95 /EC – regulating the marketing of seeds of landraces, <b>conservation</b> <b>varieties,</b> amateur varieties and seed mixtures. The Farm Seed Opportunities project aims at scientific support {{to the implementation of}} this directive by setting up coherent definitions of the varieties concerned and providing a survey and evaluation of national particularities. The project also expects to promote the recognition of the farmer's role in the on farm conservation and breeding of innovative varieties, taking into account the participatory plant breeding experiences of several groups of organic farmers. Diverse forms of agriculture and of marketing still exist in European countries. Farmers and other stakeholders in society (e. g. researchers, traders, consumers…) who are concerned about the safeguard of traditional, cultural and ecological values or wish to develop crop varieties which are better adapted to the specific needs of their local agricultural systems, need to keep access to a wider range of crop varieties than current registered ones. Organic Agriculture is one of these systems existing, which demands local adaptation of plants, as well as diversity in the range of products and multiple quality aspects demanded by consumers, therefore it requires a broadening of the seed market in order to facilitate its appropriate developmentFarm Seed Opportunities is managed by a consortium of public and private scientific institutions, peasant seed networks and organic farmers associations in six European countries. Our activities include three main aspects. The first one will consist of a survey on existing experiences, the expectations of the stakeholders and the limitations of current laws in EU countries including Hungary and Rumania. A second part will be devoted to an on farm experimental programme in three countries (Netherlands, France and Italy). Thirty farmers, mainly organic farmers, participate in these field trials. The farmers and some small scale breeders suggested their own landraces varieties of wheat, maize, spinach and beans. They have exchanged amongst each other’s the varieties. The aim of the trials is to describe how the farmers’ dynamic management and the natural pressure of selection allow them to evolve. The experimental data should be a reference to propose adaptations to the current regulations or to suggest regulation space for “peasant varieties”. The third part of the Farm Seed Opportunities programme aims to integrate all the information, to organise experts meetings and the dissemination of the results towards a broad public and to establish regulation propositions to policy makers. In all its activities, Farm Seed Opportunities will contribute to enlarging the basis of organic breeding and its farmers’ contribution. Organic agriculture and the diversity of life forms are intrinsically linked. IFOAM favours an awareness of this relationship by actions and statements on biodiversity.
