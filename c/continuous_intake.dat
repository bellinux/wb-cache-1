Basic therapy of patients with moderate severity psoriasis proved to be ineffective and {{to be accompanied by}} an exacerbation of the disease in 6 months after the treatment. The patients were discovered to have twice as high IL- 23 blood content, increased sICAM- 1 and MMP- 9 blood content by 59. 68 % and in 2. 68 times correspondingly in comparison with the control group.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that abnormal postprandial plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) metabolism may participate {{in the development of}} tissue lipotoxicity and type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). We previously found that non-diabetic offspring of two parents with T 2 D display increased plasma NEFA appearance and oxidation rates during intravenous administration of a fat emulsion. However, it is currently unknown whether plasma NEFA appearance and oxidation are abnormal during the postprandial state in these subjects at high-risk of developing T 2 D. Methodology: Palmitate appearance and oxidation rates and glycerol appearance rate were determined in eleven healthy offspring of two parents with T 2 D (positive family history, FH+), 13 healthy subjects without first-degree relatives with T 2 D (FH-) and 12 subjects with T 2 D at fasting, during normoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and during <b>continuous</b> oral <b>intake</b> of a standard liquid meal to achieve steady postprandial NEFA and triacylglycerols (TG) without and with insulin infusion to maintain similar glycemia in all three groups.

In the postprandial state, palmitate appearance, oxidative and non oxidative rates were all elevated in T 2 D (all P, 0. 05) but not in FH+.

40|$|The structure-function {{relationship}} of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) of southern sea otter has largely not been described. This study aims to describe the histological, biochemical, and biomechanical features of the TMJ disc in the southern sea otter. The TMJ discs from fresh cadaver heads of southern sea otter adult males (n= 8) and females (n= 8) acquired from strandings were examined. Following macroscopical evaluation, the TMJs were investigated for their histological, mechanical and biochemical properties. We found that the sea otter TMJ discs are, in general, similar to other carnivores. Macroscopically, the TMJ disc was highly congruent and the mandibular head was encased tightly by the mandibular fossa with a thin disc separating the joint into two compartments. Histologically the articular surfaces were lined with dense fibrous connective tissue that gradually transitioned into one to two cell thick layer of hyaline-like cartilage. The disc fibres were aligned primarily in the rostrocaudal direction and had occasional lacuna with chondrocyte-like cells. The disc was composed primarily of collagen type 1. Biochemical analysis indicates sulphated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content lower than other mammals, but significantly higher in male sea otters than female sea otters. Finally, mechanical analysis demonstrated a disc that was stronger and stiffer in the rostrocaudal direction than the mediolateral direction, but also significantly stronger and stiffer in females than males. We conclude that the congruent design of the TMJ, thin disc, biochemical content, and mechanical properties all reflect a structure-function relationship within the TMJ disc that is likely designed for the sea otter’s hard diet and <b>continuous</b> food <b>intake...</b>|$|R

Pattern and levels of analytes in long-tailed ducks (liver) and blue mussels sampled in March and May at nine sites in the Baltic Sea were compared. The geometric mean concentration (ng/g l. w.) in livers of long-tailed ducks and Baltic blue mussels were: Σ 2 PBPs: 0. 57 and 48; Σ 2 PBAs: 0. 83 and 11; Σ 7 OH-PBDEs: 6. 1 and 45; Σ 7 MeO-PBDEs: 3. 8 and 69; Σ 7 PBDEs: 8. 0 and 7. 2, respectively. Based on an estimated daily intake of 450  g fresh blue mussel meat, long-tailed ducks daily dietary intake of brominated substances while foraging in the Baltic Sea in March–May was estimated to; 390  ng Σ 2 PBPs, 90  ng Σ 2 PBAs, 370  ng Σ 7 OH-PBDEs, 590  ng Σ 7 MeO-PBDEs and 59  ng Σ 7 PBDEs. The low levels of PBPs, PBAs, OH-PBDEs and MeO-PBDEs in the long-tailed duck livers compared to blue mussel, despite a <b>continuous</b> daily <b>intake,</b> suggest that these compounds are poorly retained in long-tailed ducks...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{effectiveness}} of finasteride and dutasteride {{in women with}} androgenetic alopecia {{has been the subject}} of debate. Aim: To evaluate the {{effectiveness of}} finasteride and dutasteride on hair loss in women with androgenetic alopecia over a period of 3 years. Methods: From a database containing systematically retrieved data on 3500 women treated for androgenetic alopecia between 2002 and 2012 with finasteride 1. 25 mg or dutasteride 0. 15 mg, a random sample stratified for age and type of medication was taken to yield 30 women in two age categories: below and above 50 years, and for both medications. Hair thickness of the three thinnest hairs was measured from standardized microscopic images at three sites of the scalp at the start of the treatment and after 3 years of <b>continuous</b> medication <b>intake.</b> The macroscopic images were evaluated independently by three European dermatologists/hair experts. The diagnostic task was to identify the image displaying superior density of the hair. Results: Both age categories showed a statistically significant increase in hair thickness from baseline over the 3 -year period for finasteride and dutasteride (signed rank test, P = 0. 02). Hair thickness increase was observed in 49 (81. 7 %) women in the finasteride group and in 50 (83. 3 %) women in the dutasteride group. On average, the number of post-treatment images rated as displaying superior density was 124 (68. 9 %) in the finasteride group, and 118 (65. 6 %) in the dutasteride group. Dutasteride performed statistically significantly better than finasteride in the age category below 50 years at the central and vertex sites of the scalp. Conclusions: Finasteride 1. 25 mg and dutasteride 0. 15 mg given daily for 3 years effectively increased hair thickness and arrested further deterioration in women with androgenetic alopecia...|$|R
