500|$|Britten {{became a}} member of the film unit's small group of regular contributors, another of whom was W. H. Auden. Together they worked on the {{documentary}} films <b>Coal</b> <b>Face</b> and Night Mail in 1935. They also collaborated on the song cycle Our Hunting Fathers (1936), radical both in politics and musical treatment, and subsequently other works including Cabaret Songs, On This Island, Paul Bunyan and Hymn to St. Cecilia. Auden was a considerable influence on Britten, encouraging him to widen his aesthetic, intellectual and political horizons, and also to come to terms with his homosexuality. Auden was, as David Matthews puts it, [...] "cheerfully and guiltlessly promiscuous"; Britten, puritanical and conventional by nature, was sexually repressed.|$|E
500|$|William Brace, {{the local}} MP {{speaking}} {{on behalf of}} the South Wales Miners' Federation, announced on 16 October that the priority would be given to putting out the fire and that no more search parties would be looking for survivors. Brace observed that the fire was blocking the western workings and consuming the oxygen in the air, making it unlikely that anyone was left alive. Progress in tackling the fire over the previous days had been slow, and it had only been extinguished in the first 30 yards of the roadway—still [...] from the <b>coal</b> <b>face.</b> Two coroner's inquests were opened: one in Senghenydd for the men who died in the colliery, and one in Cardiff for those who had died in hospital; both were adjourned the same day. The first funerals took place the following day, Friday 17 October. An estimated 150,000 mourners gathered for the 11 men buried on the Saturday and 8 on the Sunday.|$|E
2500|$|After {{two years}} at the College, he {{returned}} to the <b>coal</b> <b>face,</b> but in 1919, Mainwaring was appointed as a Lecturer in Economics and Vice-Principal of the Central Labour College. This college, which renamed as The Labour College in 1920, was founded by the South Wales Miners' Federation and the National Union of Railwaymen, but most of the students were South Wales miners; opponents suspected the college was [...] "class teaching for revolutionary aims".|$|E
50|$|By the 1930s, {{when most}} of the complex was within the {{ownership}} of Powell Duffryn, the accessible coal reserves had been exhausted from the shallower shafts. Resultantly, their pit head workings were closed on economic grounds, although the workable underground <b>coal</b> <b>faces</b> were consolidated into the remaining shafts.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} it was {{producing}} around 18,000 tonnes of coal a week, with most going to local power stations along the Aire and Trent. Before the miners' strike of 1984 it was producing 24,000 tonnes a week. It had three <b>coal</b> <b>faces,</b> with two <b>coal</b> cutting machines per face.|$|R

This method has become the main approach to mining full-seam of ultra-thick seams of 14 – 20  m, and it is also an important means for achieving output of 10  Mt/year from a fully mechanized top <b>coal</b> caving <b>face.</b>|$|R

30|$|A “cantilever beam-articulated beam” {{model has}} been {{established}} for the overlying strata at the LLTCC <b>coal</b> mining <b>face.</b> Based on the model, the working resistance of the LLTCC hydraulic support has been determined. Furthermore, the law of top coal and roof movement at the LLTCC coalface has been obtained. In front of <b>face</b> <b>coal</b> wall, the main characteristics of top coal and roof movement are mainly horizontal compressive deformation under abutment pressure; {{in the rear of}} the <b>face</b> <b>coal</b> wall, the characteristics of roof movement are mainly fractures and subsidence, the characteristics of top coal movement are mainly vertical caving movements caused by roof fractures and subsidence. The speed of horizontal deformation of the top coal and roof in front of the <b>face</b> <b>coal</b> wall under abutment pressure is much smaller than that of the vertical subsidence of the top coal and roof after fracture at the rear of the <b>face</b> <b>coal</b> wall.|$|R

40|$|In coal mining, {{spontaneous}} combustion {{can occur in}} many areas such as stockpiles, underground workings, waste dumps, <b>coal</b> <b>faces,</b> in-pit ramps and backfill areas. Spontaneous combustion {{has been defined as}} an oxidation reaction, which occurs without an external heat source. Although not limited to coal, the most significant hazard of {{spontaneous combustion}} is the fires that occur in coal mining operations around the world. These fires pose a serious risk to the safety of workers in the coal mines. This phenomenon also has an environmental impact, which can affect {{the quality of life for}} future generations. Extensive research work has been done and recorded about spontaneous combustion in coal stockpiles, dumps and <b>coal</b> <b>faces,</b> but very limited work has been conducted on raw coal storage bunkers. This study investigated the occurrence of spontaneous combustion in coal storage bunkers, and established that there is no single document available that addresses the problem adequately. Therefore, a need was identified to create a guideline with decision analyser steps to be able to arrive quickly at a possible solution to the problem. This work does not address spontaneous combustion in underground workings, waste dumps, stockpiles, <b>coal</b> <b>faces,</b> in-pit ramps and backfill areas. It was found that important factors affecting the possibility of SC occurring were the type of coal being supplied to the bunker, the mining practice with regard to the standing time of the loose cubic metres of coal on the mining benches, and the impact of the physical factors around the bunker. The information obtained could be of great significance when designing or trying to solve spontaneous combustion problems in raw coal storage bunkers. The guideline and decision analyser steps can be applied early in the phase of the project in order to minimise or eliminate similar mistakes made in the industry over the years.

40|$|AbstractThe {{exploitation}} of extremely close thin coal seams is featured of great interaction {{and it is}} hard to realize the simultaneous mining of upper and lower coal seams. This paper defines the extremely close coal seam and studies the unconventional staggered distance simultaneous mining in pressure-relief region formed by locating the lower <b>coal</b> mining <b>face</b> in the upper face. The mechanical model of unconventional staggered distance simultaneous mining is established and its theoretical formula is given. The numerical simulation analyzes the influence of staggered distance on the front abutment pressure distribution: when staggered distance increases, the degree of upper <b>coal</b> mining <b>face</b> front abutment stress concentration decreases and the degree of lower <b>coal</b> mining <b>face</b> front abutment stress concentration decreases first and increases later; when the staggered distance is larger than a certain value, the front abutment pressure in lower <b>coal</b> mining <b>face</b> is in “double peak” distribution. With theoretical analysis, the staggered distance of the left six simultaneous mining face in Zhengyang Mine is conformed to be 6 m. This research conclusion has been verified in the field and significant socio-economic benefits have been achieved, which can provide a reference for safe and efficient {{exploitation of}} extremely close coal seams...|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of the Gushan Mine, the Pingzhuang coal mining {{district}} of Inner Mongolia, the average thickness of seam 6 - 2 was 7.5  m; the dip angle was 28 °– 41 °, and the hardness coefficient was 0.92 – 1.03. This seam showed various degrees of contact metamorphism. As a result, part of the seam was believed to be unrecoverable. However, guaranteed by the aforementioned key technology and technological research, the safe and efficient mining was achieved under such complex conditions. Industrial tests indicated that the equipment was pretty stable in the fully mechanized top <b>coal</b> caving <b>faces,</b> and top <b>coal</b> recovery was as high as 80  %. This example was a typical fully mechanized top <b>coal</b> caving <b>face</b> of large dip angle with safety and high efficiency, which is a good reference for the equipment antitoppling and antislip in fully mechanized top <b>coal</b> caving <b>faces</b> under similar conditions.|$|R

5000|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{longwall}} mining {{was developed in}} England in the late 17th century. Miners undercut the coal along {{the width of the}} <b>coal</b> <b>face,</b> removing coal as it fell, and used wooden props to control the fall of the roof behind the face. This was known as the Shropshire method of mining. While the technology has changed considerably, the basic idea remains the same, to remove essentially all of the coal from a broad <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> and allow the roof and overlying rock to collapse into the void behind, while maintaining a safe working space along the face for the miners.Starting around 1900, mechanization was applied to this method. By 1940, some referred to longwall mining as [...] "the conveyor method" [...] of mining, after the most prominent piece of machinery involved. [...] Unlike earlier longwall mining, the use of a conveyor belt parallel to the <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> forced the face to be developed along a straight line. The only other machinery used was an electric cutter to undercut the <b>coal</b> <b>face</b> and electric drills for blasting to drop the face. Once dropped, manual labor was used to load coal onto the conveyor parallel to the face and to place wooden roof props to control the fall of the roof.|$|E
