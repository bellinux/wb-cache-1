5000|$|Dibucaine, {{also known}} as <b>cinchocaine,</b> is an amino amide local anesthetic. When {{administered}} to humans intravenously, {{it is capable of}} inhibiting the plasma cholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase) enzyme. The dibucaine number is used to differentiate individuals who have substitution mutations (point mutations) of the enzyme's gene, resulting in decreased enzyme function.|$|E
50|$|Bupivacaine (Marcaine) is {{the local}} {{anaesthetic}} most commonly used, although lidocaine (lignocaine), tetracaine, procaine, ropivacaine, levobupivicaine, prilocaine and <b>cinchocaine</b> may also be used. Commonly opioids are added to improve the block and provide post-operative pain relief, examples include morphine, fentanyl, diamorphine or buprenorphine. Non-opioids like clonidine may also be added to prolong the duration of analgesia (although Clonidine may cause hypotension). In the United Kingdom, since 2004 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean section is supplemented with intrathecal diamorphine and this combination is now the modal form of anaesthesia for this indication in that country. The peculiar legal status of diamorphine (heroin) means that this cannot easily occur elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|The first {{described}} placement of a lumbar epidural catheter {{was performed by}} Pío Manuel María Martínez Curbelo (5 June 19061 May 1962) on January 13, 1947. Curbelo, a Cuban anesthesiologist, introduced a 16 gauge Tuohy needle into the left flank of a 40-year-old woman with a large ovarian cyst. Through this needle, he introduced a 3.5 French ureteral catheter made of elastic silk into the lumbar epidural space. He then removed the needle, leaving the catheter in place and repeatedly injected 0.5% percaine (<b>cinchocaine,</b> also known as dibucaine) to achieve anesthesia. Curbelo presented his work on September 9, 1947, at the 22nd Joint Congress of the International Anesthesia Research Society and the International College of Anesthetists, in New York City.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} topical policresulen and <b>cinchocaine</b> in the postoperative pain behavior of open hemorrhoidectomy. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, double-blinded, controlled study. The control group received the usual guidelines with oral medications. The topical treatment group received, in addition, {{the application of the}} ointment and was comprised of two subgroups (policresulen + <b>cinchocaine,</b> and placebo). Pain intensity was recorded with the visual analogue scale. RESULTS: 43 patients were operated on: control group - n = 13, one excluded; placebo - n = 15; and policresulen + <b>cinchocaine</b> - n = 15. The mean age was 45. 98 years and 37. 2 % were men. The average pain intensity was 4. 09 (immediate postoperative), 3. 22 (hospital discharge), 5. 73 (day 1), 5. 77 (day 2), 5. 74 (day 3), 5. 65 (day 7), 5. 11 (day 10), 2. 75 (day 15) and 7. 70 (first bowel movement), with no difference between groups in all periods.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Contact allergy {{to local}} {{anaesthetics}} is relatively common. Patch testing with benzocaine in the European baseline series {{is recommended for}} diagnosis, even though a caine mix has been previously suggested to be superior. OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency and patterns of contact allergy to local anaesthetics by using a caine mix (benzocaine, tetracaine, and <b>cinchocaine)</b> in the baseline series, and evaluate its efficiency as compared with benzocaine alone. METHODS: We reviewed the results of 2736 patch tests performed between 2000 and 2010, identifying patients with positive reactions to caine mix or to one of seven local anaesthetics. RESULTS: One hundred and twelve patients (4. 1 %) {{had at least one}} allergic reaction to local anaesthetics; 86 were tested with all seven local anaesthetics, resulting in 71 reactions in 53 patients. <b>Cinchocaine</b> gave the most reactions (50. 7 %); these occurred as a single reaction in 83. 3 % of patients, mostly with current or past relevance (97 %). Benzocaine represented 22. 5 % of reactions, many of which were non-relevant (44 %) or resulting from cross-reactions with para-compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 70 % of allergic reactions to local anaesthetics would have been missed if benzocaine had been used as a screening allergen. This study supports a recommendation to replace benzocaine with a caine mix containing <b>cinchocaine</b> in the baseline patch test series...|$|E

40|$|Procaine {{and several}} general {{anaesthetics}} block production of action potentials in frog skeletal muscle fibres {{by a single}} mechanism of action, which suggests {{that there might be}} a common basic mechanism of action on neurones in the central nervous system. Procaine or <b>cinchocaine</b> given alone to intact white mice produced “excitement” and convulsions but when given 60 min after phenobarbitone they caused central nervous depression. Large, convulsant doses of procaine or <b>cinchocaine</b> abolished the righting reflex in mice previously treated with small, subanaesthetic doses of phenobarbitone. In contrast, leptazol only antagonized the depression produced by phenobarbitone. When applied directly to neuronally isolated slabs of cat cerebral cortex, procaine or pentobarbitone reduced the sizes of the surface negative and surface positive responses to direct electrical stimulation of the cortex. Leptazol had the opposite effect. When given systemically, procaine only increased the electrical threshold for the surface positive response recorded from the isolated slab; ether either increased or did not change this threshold, and leptazol either decreased or did not change it. These results are consistent with the suggestion that general and local anaesthetics have a fundamentally similar action on neurones in the central nervous system...|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{amphiphilic}} cations caused very large {{increases in the}} rates of incorporation of Pi and glycerol into phosphatidylinositol in pig mesenteric small lymphocytes. This synthesis de novo of phosphatidylinositol led to a doubling of the phosphatidylinositol concentration in the cells within 3. 5 h. The increase in synthesis of phosphatidylinositol labelled with [3 H]- or [14 C]-glycerol was matched by an approximately equivalent decrease in incorporation of glycerol into phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and triacylglycerol. Amphilic cations which produced these effects included, in order of decreasing effectiveness, trifluoperazine (half-maximal effect at about 70 mum) greater than chlorpromazine approximately promethazine approximately imipramine greater than <b>cinchocaine</b> greater than amethocaine approximately cetyltrimethylammonium greater than fenfluramine greater than amphetamine greater than 2 -phenethylamine greater than cocaine approximately procaine; the most effective compounds were those with {{the largest and most}} hydrophobic non-polar substituents. The response to cations was not changed by varying the extracellular Ca 2 + concentration in the range 10 nm- 1 mm. The active amphiphilic cations interacted with anionic phospholipids causing aggregation of aqueous dispersions and/or changes in chromatographic behaviour. These results indicate that amphiphilic cations redirect glycerolipid synthesis de novo, probably owing to inhibition of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, so that phosphatidylinositol synthesis is increased {{at the expense of other}} glycerolipids...|$|E
40|$|PurposeThe aim of {{this study}} was to give an {{overview}} of the prevalence of contact allergy to active ingredients and excipients of topical medications across Europe. MethodsRetrospective analysis of data collected by the European Surveillance System on Contact Allergies () with substances applied to consecutively patch tested patients, 2009 - 2012, in 54 departments in 12 European countries. ResultsIn view of the varying composition of the baseline series used in the previously mentioned departments and countries, between 58833 (lanolin alcohols) and 16498 patients (sodium metabisulfite) were patch tested with the topical agents covered in this study. Among these, positive (allergic) reactions were most commonly observed to sodium metabisulfite (3. 12 % positive), followed by propolis (2. 48 %), Compositae mix (1. 73 %), lanolin alcohols (1. 65 %) and caine mix III (benzocaine, <b>cinchocaine</b> and tetracaine; 1. 27 %). ConclusionsSeveral of the substances warrant routine screening for contact allergy, i. e. patch testing in a baseline series. However, in view of a vast number of other topical agents, additional patch testing with the suspect topical drug preparations (including natural remedies and cosmetics) is warranted. In the event of a positive test to the (pharmaceutical) product, single ingredients should be tested individually to precisely identify the hapten(s). Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Purpose, An {{in vitro}} study {{was carried out}} to {{determine}} the iontophoretic permeability of local anesthetics through human epidermis. The relationship between physicochemical structure and the permeability of these solutes was then examined using an ionic mobility-pore model developed to define quantitative relationships. Methods. The iontophoretic permeability of both ester-type anesthetics (procaine, butacaine, tetracaine) and amide-type anesthetics (prilocaine, mepivacaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, etidocaine, <b>cinchocaine)</b> were determined through excised human epidermis over 2 hrs using a constant d. c. current and Ag/AgCl electrodes. Individual ion mobilities were determined from conductivity measurements in aqueous solutions. Multiple stepwise regression was applied to interrelate the iontophoretic permeability of the solutes with their physical properties to examine {{the appropriateness of the}} ionic mobility-pore model and to determine the best predictor of iontophoretic permeability of the local anesthetics. Results. The logarithm of the iontophoretic permeability coefficient (log PCj,iont) for local anesthetics was directly related to the log ionic mobility and MW for the free volume form of the model when other conditions are held constant. Multiple linear regressions confirmed that log PCj,iont was best defined by ionic mobility (and its determinants: conductivity, pK(a) and MW) and MW. Conclusions. Our results suggest that of the properties studied, the best predictors of iontophoretic transport of local anesthetics are ionic mobility (or pK(a)) and molecular size. These predictions are consistent with the ionic mobility pore model determined by the mobility of ions in the aqueous solution, the total current, epidermal permselectivity and other factors as defined by the model...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} glycerolipid {{synthesis}} {{of a series}} of compounds including many drugs were investigated in cell-free preparations and slices of rat liver. p-Chlorobenzoate, p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate, halofenate, D-amphetamine, adrenaline, procaine and N-[2 -(4 -chloro- 3 -sulphamoylbenzoyloxy) ethyl]norfenfluramine had little inhibitory effect on any of the systems investigated. Two amphiphilic anions, clofenapate and 2 -(p-chlorophenyl) - 2 -(m-trifluoromethylphenoxy) acetate, both inhibited glycerol phosphate acyltransferase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase at approx. 1. 6 and 0. 7 mm respectively. Clofenapate (1 mm) also inhibited the incorporation of glycerol into lipids by rat liver slices without altering the relative proportions of the different lipids synthesized. The amphilic amines, mepyramine, fenfluramine, norfenfluramine, hydroxyethylnorfenfluramine, N-(2 -benzoyloxyethyl) norfenfluramine, <b>cinchocaine,</b> chlorpromazine and demethylimipramine inhibited phosphatidate phosphohydrolase by 50 % at concentrations between 0. 2 and 0. 9 mm. The last four compounds inhibited glycerol phosphate acyltransferase by 50 % at concentrations between 1 and 2. 6 mm. None of the amines examined appeared to be an effective inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase. Norfenfluramine, hydroxyethylnorfenfluramine and N-(2 -benzoyloxyethyl) norfenfluramine produced less inhibition of glycerol incorporation into total lipids than was observed with equimolar clofenapate. The major effect of these amines in liver slices was to inhibit triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine synthesis and to produce a marked accumulation of phosphatidate. The results are discussed in terms of the control of glycerolipid synthesis. They partly explain the observed effects of the various drugs on lipid metabolism. The possible use of these compounds as biochemical tools with which to investigate the reactions of glycerolipid synthesis is considered...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} drugs classed as calcium antagonists, spasmolytics, {{non-specific}} receptor antagonists or receptor antagonists with multiple sites of action were tested {{to determine whether}} they prevent the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover caused in various tissues by the activation of receptors which increase cell-surface Ca 2 + permeability. The experiments were done with fragments of longitudinal smooth muscle from guinea-pig ileum; these were incubated in vitro with 32 Pi and either 100 muM-carbamoylcholine or 100 muM-histamine, in the presence of antagonistic drugs at concentrations at least sufficient to cause complete blockade of smooth-muscle contraction. The phosphatidylinositol response to carbamoylcholine was not changed by <b>cinchocaine,</b> papaverine, nifedipine, dibenamine, amethocaine, cinnarizine, lidoflazine, methoxyverapamil, prenylamine or two antimuscarinic alkane-bis-ammonium compounds, and the response to histamine was unaffected by the first four drugs. In contrast, phenoxybenzamine prevented the increase in phosphatidylinositol labelling caused by either carbamoylcholine or histamine. The insensitivity of the phosphatidylinositol response to most of the drugs provides further experimental support for the conclusion that the receptor-stimulated phosphatidylinositol breakdown which initiates the increase in phosphatidylinositol turnover is not caused by an increase in intracellular Ca 2 +. The simplest interpretation of the available information appears to be that phosphatidylinositol breakdown plays a role in the coupling between the receptor-agonist interaction and the opening of cell-surface Ca 2 + gates [Michell, R. H. (1975) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 415, 81 - 147]. If this is correct, then phenoxybenzamine must exert its inhibitory effects on phosphatidylinositol breakdown early in this sequence of events, but the drugs must act at a stage later than phosphatidylinositol breakdown. The unexpected difference in the effects of dibenamine and phenoxybenzamine, which are chemically very similar, may provide a useful experimental tool with which to explore the way in which activated receptors provoke the opening of cell-surface Ca 2 + gates...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} that Ca 2 + ions {{are involved in}} the control of the increased phosphatidylinositol turnover which is provoked by alpha-adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic stimulation of rat parotid-gland fragments has been investigated. Both types of stimulation provoked phosphatidylinositol breakdown, which was detected either chemically or radiochemically, and provoked a compensatory synthesis of the lipid, detected as an increased rate of incorporation of 32 Pi into phosphatidylinositol. Acetylcholine had little effect on the incorporation of labelled glycerol, whereas adrenaline stimulated it significantly, but to a much lower extent than 32 P incorporation: this suggests that the response to acetylcholine was entirely accounted for by renewal of the phosphorylinositol head-group of the lipid, but that some synthesis de novo was involved in the response to adrenaline. The responses to both types of stimulation, whether measured as phosphatidylinositol breakdown or as phosphatidylinositol labelling, occurred equally well in incubation media containing 2. 5 mm-Ca 2 + or 0. 2 mm-EGTA [ethanedioxybis(ethylamine) -tetra-acetic acid]. Incubation with a bivalent cation ionophore (A 23187) led to a small and more variable increase in phosphatidylinositol labelling with 32 Pi, which occurred whether or not Ca 2 + was available in the extracellular medium: this was not accompanied by significant phosphatidylinositol breakdown. <b>Cinchocaine,</b> a local anaesthetic, produced parallel increases in the incorporation of Pi and glycerol into phosphatidylinositol. This is compatible with its known ability to inhibit phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (EC 3. 1. 3. 4) and increase phosphatidylinositol synthesis de novo in other cells. These results indicate that the phosphatidylinositol turnover evoked by alpha-adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic stimuli in rat parotid gland probably does not depend on an influx of Ca 2 + into the cells in response to stimulation. This is in marked contrast with the K+ efflux from this tissue, which is controlled by the same receptors, but is strictly dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca 2 +. The Ca 2 +-independence of stimulated phosphatidylinositol metabolism may mean that it is controlled through a mode of receptor function different from that which controls other cell responses. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as indicating that stimulated phosphatidylinositol breakdown is intimately involved in the mechanisms of action of alpha-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptor systems...|$|E
