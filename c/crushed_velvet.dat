25|$|The Blitz Kids {{described}} the {{movement as a}} retaliation to punk due to it becoming too violent and unsavory crowds such as neo-Nazis and skinheads deciding to jump on that aesthetic bandwagon. It was also a way to forget their relative poverty following the economic recession and the Winter of Discontent. Features of New Romantic clothing varied from individual to individual, although these generally highlighted the implied individualism, creativity and self-expression of the movement, besides its continued adherence to the DIY ethic of punk. It was inspired by different cultures and time periods, films, film noir, and theatricality. Men often wore dramatic cosmetics and androgynous clothing, including ruffled poet shirts, red or blue hussar jackets with gold braid, silk sashes, tight pants, shiny rayon waistcoats, and tailcoats based on those worn during the Regency era. Women, too, were very theatrical in terms of makeup and style, and often favoured big hair, fishnet gloves, corsets, <b>crushed</b> <b>velvet,</b> and elements of Middle Eastern and gypsy clothing.|$|E
500|$|The film {{also gave}} costume {{designer}} Robert Blackman {{an opportunity to}} address issues with the Starfleet dress uniforms, which Blackman had changed on several occasions during The Next Generation. The uniforms appeared {{for the first time}} in the episode [...] "Lonely Among Us", and were based on the 18th century designs for the Royal Navy. For Insurrection, Blackman initially thought of creating a uniform with short jackets in blue, red and gold, which he later said was [...] "not a good idea". His eventual design removed the color palettes for specific divisions. Blackman said, [...] "No matter what, white over black has a formal look to it." [...] Sanja Milkovic Hayes created the remaining new costumes for the film. She avoided making the Ba'ku look too cute, and used material made from cellulose fiber specifically created for Insurrection. She said it was organic, and was simply cooked and then glued together. The Son'a costumes were made from layers of <b>crushed</b> <b>velvet</b> and metal strips. The female bodysuits were made of latex; Hayes wanted them to appear [...] "sexy, but not vulgar" [...] and described the outfits as [...] "very conservative".|$|E

5000|$|Critics of the CoA {{have raised}} {{concerns}} about the image that their magazine puts across: the magazine [...] "Witchcraft & Wicca" [...] is glossier {{than most of the}} publications produced by pagan groups in the UK, and appears to be aimed at a younger target audience, and features large quantities of <b>crushed</b> <b>velvet</b> and similar [...] "spooky" [...] dress.
