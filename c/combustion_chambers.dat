5|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} {{was used}} to provide attitude control {{on the first two}} stages. The eight first stage <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> were arranged in pairs which could gimbal either way along one axis. Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided roll, pitch and yaw control. The second stage had two <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers,</b> which could gimbal along two axes, providing the same level of control. During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system. The third stage did not have an attitude control system, and was instead spin-stabilised.|$|E
5|$|Four Black Arrows were {{launched}} between 1969 and 1971. The first two launches were demonstration flights, with battleship third stages and a boilerplate payload. On {{the first flight}} an electrical fault caused a pair of first stage <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> to pivot back and forth. Before it cleared the launch pad, the rocket was rolling erratically, and about a minute later it began to disintegrate. After the first stage engine failed, and the rocket began to fall back to earth, it was destroyed by range safety. The second launch was successful. The first all-up launch on 2 September 1970 was the third launch of the Black Arrow, and Britain's first attempt to launch a satellite. The launch failed due to a leak in the second stage oxidiser pressurisation system, which caused it to cut out early. The third stage fired, but the rocket did not reach orbit, and re-entered over the Gulf of Carpentaria. The fourth launch successfully orbited the Prospero satellite, making the United Kingdom the sixth nation to place a satellite into orbit {{by means of an}} indigenously developed carrier rocket. The satellite, also known as X-3, was named Prospero after the character Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The name was chosen as a reference to events in the play, in which Prospero, a sorcerer, gives up his powers. Prior to the cancellation of the Black Arrow programme, the satellite was to be named after Puck from A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E

The RD-170 became the basis for the Zenit booster family which began flying in 1985, and because the Buran space shuttle was not ready to go yet, Energia's maiden flight in May 1987 carried aloft a prototype space station module called Polyus. Ultimately, Buran did fly the following summer, a few months before Glushko's death.|$|E
25|$|Mach3 {{performance}} in the 1950s was difficult to achieve. Jet engines compress incoming air, then mix it with fuel and ignite the mixture. The resulting expansion of gases produces thrust. The compressors generally can ingest air only at subsonic speeds. To operate supersonically, aircraft use advanced intakes to slow the supersonic air to a usable speed. The energy lost in this process heats the air, which means the engine has to operate at ever-higher temperatures to provide net thrust. The limiting factor in this process is {{the temperature of the}} materials in the engines, in particular, the turbine blades just behind the <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers.</b> Using materials available at the time, speeds much beyond Mach2.5 were difficult to achieve.|$|E
25|$|Producing metric {{drawings}} and analyzing {{the materials used}} in the Derwent V went fairly quickly, but finding {{a substitute for the}} high-temperature, creep-resistant Nimonic 80 steel alloy was a more difficult challenge. Eventually an alloy that matched Nimonic 80's high-temperature properties was found in KhN 80T, but it was not creep-resistant. The first Derwent V copy, designated as the RD-500 (Reaktivnyy Dvigatel — jet engine) after the Factory No. 500 where the engine was first produced, was being tested on 31 December 1947, but problems cropped up quickly. Combustion was uneven and this cracked the <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers.</b> This may {{have had something to do}} with the modifications made by the Soviets to the fuel, speed and starter systems. But these problems were resolved by September 1948 when the engine passed its 100-hour State acceptance test.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{the effect of}} <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> {{geometry}} on performance, combustion and emissions of ethanol-diesel blend operated in direct injection Diesel engine is discussed. The main air motions are generated in the cylinder by the intake - induced swirl, the piston motion, and its geometry. The piston bowl is modified from traditional hemispherical <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> to the toroidal (re-en-trant) <b>combustion</b> <b>chamber</b> and operated with Neat diesel and 40 % ethanol diesel blend to improve better evaporation and mixing during the compression stroke on a single cylinder Diesel engine.

More commonly, however, biodiesel causes problems simply because it removes all of the built-up residue in an engine, clogging filters, unless care is taken when switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel. It is very effective at 'de-coking' the diesel engines <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> and keeping them clean. Biodiesel is the lowest emission fuel available for diesel engines. Diesel engines are the most efficient car internal combustion engines.

25|$|He {{also worked}} {{on the design of}} a {{propeller}} with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911, and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908. At the time, contemporary propeller designs were not advanced enough to actually put Wittgenstein’s ideas into practice, and it would be years before a blade design that could support Wittgenstein’s innovative design was created. Wittgenstein’s design required air and gas to be forced along the propeller arms to <b>combustion</b> <b>chambers</b> on the end of each blade, where it was then compressed by the centrifugal force exerted by the revolving arms and ignited.
