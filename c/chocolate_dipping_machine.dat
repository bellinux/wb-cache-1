Voltage sags cause speed variations on SM (with possible lost of synchronism), current and torque peaks and hence may cause tripping and equipment damage, which leads to financial losses. Three machines of different nominal power have been modeled and simulated with MATLAB in order to study its behavior under voltage sags. These SM’s have been analyzed operating as generator, as motor, and in both cases, working under-excited and overexcited. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|In general, organic grown apples (Malus x domestica Borkh.) are {{not treated}} with {{chemical}} fungicides to prevent storage decay and these fruits may suffer up to 30 % decay during storage. Preliminary experiments {{had shown that}} hot water dipping of apples may be an alternative. To inhibit Gloeosporium rot (Pezicula alba, P. malicortis) water temperature may be of about 50 °C and dipping time from 60 sec up to 180 sec. The present investigation was conducted to test different ranges of temperatures and dipping time periods in different apple cultivars over a three year investigation. The objective was to determinate the suitable hot water treatment that prevents decay incidence and maintains fruit quality (firmness, scale symptoms). For the reduction of post harvest decay the treatment 53 °C and 180 sec is recommended; that was found suitable for `Topaz`. For cultivars with a sensitivity to skin disorders dips for 120 sec or 180 sec are recommended; that was found best for ´Elstar´(51 °C), ´Ingrid Marie` (49 °C), ´Holsteiner Cox´(51 °C) und ´Boskoop´(51 °C).
