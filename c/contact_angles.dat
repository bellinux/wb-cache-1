5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding <b>contact</b> <b>angles.</b> The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> are known as metastable states.|$|E
5|$|A {{contact angle}} less than 90° (low contact angle) usually {{indicates}} that wetting {{of the surface}} is very favorable, and the fluid will spread over a large area of the surface. <b>Contact</b> <b>angles</b> greater than 90° (high contact angle) generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet.|$|E
5|$|The {{penetration}} front propagates {{to minimize}} the surface energy until it reaches {{the edges of the}} drop, thus arriving at the Wenzel state. Since the solid can be considered an absorptive material due to its surface roughness, this phenomenon of spreading and imbibition is called hemiwicking. The <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> at which spreading/imbibition occurs are between 0 and π/2.|$|E

The maximum possible <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> {{is referred to as}} the advancing <b>contact</b> <b>angle.</b> The receding <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> can be measured by removing volume from the drop until dewetting occurs.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed accessIn this paper {{we present a}} theory {{describing}} the diffusion limited evaporation of sessile water droplets in presence of <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> hysteresis. Theory describes two stages of evaporation process: (I) evaporation with a constant radius of the droplet base; and (II) evaporation with constant <b>contact</b> <b>angle.</b> During stage (I) the <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> decreases from static advancing <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> to static receding <b>contact</b> <b>angle,</b> during stage (II) the <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> remains equal to the static receding <b>contact</b> <b>angle.</b> Universal dependences are deduced for both evaporation stages.

5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle hysteresis. Zero hysteresis implies the advancing and receding <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding <b>contact</b> <b>angles,</b> {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of the contact line. If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E
500|$|For water, a {{wettable}} surface {{may also}} be termed hydrophilic and a nonwettable surface hydrophobic. Superhydrophobic surfaces have <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> greater than 150°, showing almost no contact between the liquid drop and the surface. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Lotus effect". The table describes varying <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> and their corresponding solid/liquid and liquid/liquid interactions. For nonwater liquids, the term lyophilic is used for low contact angle conditions and lyophobic is used when higher <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> result. Similarly, the terms omniphobic and omniphilic apply to both polar and apolar liquids.|$|E

40|$|The {{flotation}} {{response of}} chalcopyrite {{has been characterized}} {{as a function of}} particle size and advancing <b>contact</b> <b>angle.</b> The advancing <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> of individual particle size fractions was controlled to different values. Flotation experiments were carried out under constant hydrodynamics and feed particle size distribution. A two-component kinetic model was used to fit the experimental flotation data. The maximum recovery increased with advancing <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> for each size fraction. Particles within the same size fraction and within the same <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> range displayed similar flotation behaviour, within experimental error, in different tests. Evidence of a distribution of advancing <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> values within each particle size fraction was found, and it was assumed that particles in the non-floating fraction had advancing <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> values below the critical <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> required for stable bubble-particle attachment. The flotation results were used to model the maximum recovery and the critical <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> as a function of particle size, assuming a statistical distribution of <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> values about a measured mean. The recovery and rate constant data were collated into master curves as a function of particle size for different <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> ranges. These master curves, together with the critical <b>contact</b> <b>angle,</b> may be used to benchmark the flotation response of chalcopyrite and to infer an effective operational <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> in natural ores. ...|$|R

500|$|The Young {{equation}} {{assumes a}} perfectly flat and rigid surface {{often referred to}} as an ideal surface.

50|$|The <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> is the angle, {{conventionally}} measured {{through the}} liquid, where a liquid-vapor interface meets a solid surface. It quantifies the wettability {{of a solid}} surface by a liquid via the Young equation. A given system of solid, liquid, and vapor at a given temperature and pressure has a unique equilibrium <b>contact</b> <b>angle.</b> However, in practice <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> hysteresis is observed, ranging from the so-called advancing (maximal) <b>contact</b> <b>angle</b> to the receding (minimal) <b>contact</b> <b>angle.</b> The equilibrium <b>contact</b> is within those values, and can be calculated from them.

500|$|A {{well-known}} {{departure from}} ideality {{is when the}} surface of interest has a rough texture. The rough texture of a surface can {{fall into one of}} two categories: homogeneous or heterogeneous. A homogeneous wetting regime is where the liquid fills in the roughness grooves of a surface. A heterogeneous wetting regime, though, [...] is where the surface is a composite of two types of patches. An important example of such a composite surface is one composed of patches of both air and solid. Such surfaces have varied effects on the <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> of wetting liquids. Cassie–Baxter and Wenzel are the two main models that attempt to describe the wetting of textured surfaces. However, these equations only apply when the drop size is sufficiently large compared with the surface roughness scale. When the droplet size is comparable to that of the underlying pillars, the effect of line tension should be considered[...]|$|E
50|$|This {{occurs because}} as {{the size of}} the {{homogeneous}} domains become very small compared to {{the size of the}} drop, the differences in <b>contact</b> <b>angles</b> along different homogeneous regions becomes indistinguishable from the average of the <b>contact</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|E
