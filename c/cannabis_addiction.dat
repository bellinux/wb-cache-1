However, while the rates of {{cannabis}} dependence and treatment increase, there remains no medications approved for this use. Due to its sedative effects and low abuse liability, the typical antipsychotic pericyazine has been utilized in some parts of Australia for the treatment of cannabis dependence. We aimed to provide documentation of preliminary outcomes and acceptability of pericyazine treatment in a small sample. A naturalistic case series study was conducted in which 21 patients were enrolled for a 4 -week course of pericyazine (up to 8 &times; 2. 5 mg tablets daily) and weekly medical review. Levels of cannabis use were reported and side effects with electrocardiography and blood tests were monitored. Measures of dependence severity, depression, anxiety, and insomnia were taken at baseline and follow-up utilizing validated psychometric tools. Significant reductions in cannabis use, depression, anxiety, and insomnia severity occurred across time. Pericyazine appeared to be well tolerated and easily administered in the community clinics. The results provide some preliminary evidence that low-dose short-term pericyazine may be an acceptable mode of treatment in this population. Given the open-label nature of the design, we cannot conclude that pharmacotherapy was uniquely responsible for the treatment effect. Nonetheless, low-dose pericyazine may be a potentially effective approach to the treatment of cannabis dependence, and further evaluation via a randomized placebo-controlled trial is warranted.

40|$|Drug {{addiction}} is {{an association of}} compulsive drug use with long-term associative learning/memory. Multiple forms of learning/memory are primarily subserved by activity- or experience-dependent synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Recent studies suggest LTP expression in locally activated glutamate synapses onto dopamine neurons (local Glu-DA synapses) of the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) following a single or chronic exposure to many drugs of abuse, whereas a single exposure to cannabinoid did not significantly affect synaptic plasticity at these synapses. It is unknown whether chronic exposure of cannabis (marijuana or cannabinoids), {{the most commonly used}} illicit drug worldwide, induce LTP or LTD at these synapses. More importantly, whether such alterations in VTA synaptic plasticity causatively contribute to drug addictive behavior has not previously been addressed. Here we show in rats that chronic cannabinoid exposure activates VTA cannabinoid CB 1 receptors to induce transient neurotransmission depression at VTA local Glu-DA synapses through activation of NMDA receptors and subsequent endocytosis of AMPA receptor GluR 2 subunits. A GluR 2 -derived peptide blocks cannabinoid-induced VTA synaptic depression and conditioned place preference, i. e., learning to associate drug exposure with environmental cues. These data not only provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic depression at VTA dopamine circuitry requires GluR 2 endocytosis, but also suggest an essential contribution of such synaptic depression to cannabinoid-associated addictive learning, in addition to pointing to novel pharmacological strategies for the treatment of <b>cannabis</b> <b>addiction.</b> Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 	Stimulant usage {{progressively}} replaces opiate and <b>cannabis</b> <b>addiction</b> {{and become}} substance dependence problem of today. Treatment of stimulant users is traditionally {{the same as}} for the opiate addiction. Asthenia, dysphoria and negativism are common causes for psychological dependence. Tranquilizers, antipsychotics, sedatives can quickly help to cope with the negative behavioral disorders that accompany drug usage, but reduced psycho-physical and bio-social activity are common side effects of their use. Thus development of the new replacement therapy methods for stimulant addiction is urgent task for today’s medicine. We propose neurofeedback audiovisual stimulation (AVS) in combination with hypnotic suggestion as a new approach for stimulant addiction treatment. The group of patients was treated with AVS therapy in combination with hypnotic suggestion, which was used as the replacement therapy at the abstinence period. Psychological testing, EEG and fMRI were used for the evaluation of the AVS effects. Psychological tests showed that AVS combined with hypno-suggestive therapy helped to reduce negative psychotic symptoms of the drug withdrawal syndrome. EEG effect of the AVS appeared in predominant delta rhythm displacement by the alpha rhythm after the treatment. fMRI exams showed considerable increase of the volumes of activation after the AVS and almost complete extinction of the deactivation, which is normally present at the time of task execution. The last could be also considered as a marker for prolonged effect of brain stimulation by the AVS therapy. Thus AVS combined with hypno-suggestive therapy is a promising method for the rehabilitation of patients, which are addicted to stimulants. Walery Zuko...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive Functions in Patients with Cannabis Use Disorders Because {{cannabis}} use often {{precedes the}} use of other illicit psychoactive substances, it has been characterized as a gateway to these other substances (1). Also the evidence suggests that, along with other harms, such as cognitive function impairments, cannabis is a significant risk factor in the etiology of psychosis (2). Nevertheless, {{if we look at}} the data of recent years, probation admissions to Addiction Center (AMATEM) within our hospital, which are related with cannabis use increase significantly; number of first admissions/number of control admissions for 2008, 2009 and 2010 are as 2318 / 24261, 3759 / 31862 and 5639 / 30959 respectively. Also epidemiological studies show that the number of adults using cannabis is increasing (3). There are even some political events advocating for the decriminalization of non-medical cannabis use in the United States: April 20 has evolved into a counterculture holiday, where people gather to celebrate and consume cannabis (4). Many factors can impact cannabis-related impairment and recovery of cognitive functions, including age of onset of smoking cannabis, years of use, and amount of regular use (5). Adolescents are more vulnerable to using cannabis, and because of their stage of mental development, the cognitive effects are more pronounced (2). Some cannabis-related cognitive function deficits improve after cessation of cannabis use, but growing evidence also suggests that other deficits persist after cannabis is discontinued and may hinder an individuals ability to make the best use of behavioral therapies, putting him or her at greater risk for relapse to cannabis use (6). Cannabis seems to continue to exert impairing effects in executive functions even after 3 weeks of abstinence and beyond. Although basic attentional and working memory abilities are largely restored, the most enduring and detectable deficits are seen in decision-making, concept formation, and planning. Verbal fluency impairments are somewhat mixed at this stage. Similar to the residual effects of cannabis use, those studies with subjects having chronic, heavy cannabis use show the most enduring deficits following three weeks or more abstinence (7). With the recent reporting of regional structural brain changes in long-term heavy cannabis users (reduction in hippocampal and amygdala volumes), research has yet to examine the extent to which such alterations may be reversible with abstinence (8). Nevertheless, one can suggest that some of these impairments are not completely reversible upon cessation of cannabis use, and moreover may interfere with the treatment of <b>cannabis</b> <b>addiction.</b> Therefore, targeting cognitive impairment associated with chronic cannabis use may be a promising novel strategy for the treatment of <b>cannabis</b> <b>addiction</b> (9). Currently, there is a lot of interest in cannabis use as a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia. Cognitive dysfunction associated with long-term or heavy cannabis use is similar in many respects to the cognitive endophenotypes that have been proposed as vulnerability markers of schizophrenia (8). While acute administration of cannabis to patients with schizophrenia exacerbates symptoms and cognitive impairments and may have enduring effects, cannabis has also been found to have some beneficial effects on cognition, at least in certain subgroups of patients (10). Cannabis user patients had better attention and executive functions than non-cannabis user patients at baseline and after one year of treatment in a representative sample of first-episode schizophrenia patients. Cannabis user patients appear to comprise a subgroup of patients with a better premorbid adjustment and premorbid frontal cognitive functions (11). Thus, while cannabis use is traditionally associated with cognitive impairment, the relationship is more complex in the case of schizophrenia. Meta-analyses demonstrate that patients with established schizophrenia with a cannabis use history display superior cognitive abilities compared with noncannabis-using patients. Furthermore, this study showed that better cognitive performance is seen only in lifetime users, but not in novice users (10). In a recent study, relative to controls, first-episode psychosis patients with a history of cannabis use displayed only selective neuropsychological impairments while those without a history of cannabis use displayed generalized deficits. When directly compared, patients with a history of cannabis use performed better on tests of visual memory, working memory, and executive functioning. Patients with early onset cannabis use had less neuropsychological impairment than patients with later onset use. Authors suggested that, this association between better cognitive performance and cannabis use in schizophrenia may be driven by a subgroup of neurocognitively less impaired patients, who only developed psychosis after a relatively early initiation into cannabis use (10). Related with this subject, I want to remind you that in the 4 th National Congress of Psychopharmacology, which will be held in Antalya on November 23  27, 2011, a panel with the title of Cannabis; relaxing to madness will be included and a variety of topics related with cannabis will be discussed.

40|$|SUMMARY : The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a {{widespread}} neuromodulatory system in the brain. The ECS consists mainly of cannabinoid receptors, their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) of which anandamide and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) are the best characterized examples, and transport and degradation proteins. Endocannabinoids are lipids synthesized and released ‘on-demand’ in dendrites subjected to membrane depolarization. In contrast to classic neurotransmitters, endocannabinoids are not stored in vesicles but immediately released after synthesis. They {{move back to the}} presynaptic nerve terminal where they bind to the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB 1 R) and activate it. The CB 1 R is predominantly presynaptically located and distributed in high concentration in the frontal neocortex, especially the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex, in the neostriatum and in the posterior cingulate and precuneus. CB 1 R activation modulates synaptic release of major neurotransmitter systems such as glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and indirectly also dopamine. Modulating activity of the major neurotransmitters, CB 1 R may interact with dopamine neurotransmission in the CNS and this has an important influence in various dopamine-related neurobiological processes (e. g. control of movement, motivation/reward) and, particularly, on different pathologies affecting these processes like drug addiction and psychosis. For decades, dopamine has been proposed as the key neurotransmitter in mediating drug reward processes and schizophrenia and related-psychoses. On the one hand, chronic drug abuse leads to a complex cascade of adaptive neurochemical alterations that induce dependence and tolerance, which is related to decreased dopaminergic function. However, the exact signaling pathways and mechanisms underlying the development of drug dependence and the propensity to relapse are still unclear, and the few available pharmacotherapeutic interventions developed for the treatment of drug dependence remain unsatisfactory. On the other hand, overactivity of mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic pathways can result in schizophrenia. Existing antipsychotics, which act mainly on dopamine and serotonin receptors, are generally not very effective in treating negative symptoms, and additionally a significant portion of patients are refractory to all current treatments. For this reason, there is still a demand for new targets with potential pharmacotherapeutic application potential. Currently, the ECS has been recognized as an important target in the common neural networks underlying addictive and psychiatric disorders. In this work, we use positron emission tomography (PET) to study in vivo human cerebral CB 1 R availability and dopamine release using the [18 F]MK- 9470 and [18 F]fallypride tracers respectively. In this thesis, we first demonstrate the in vivo central key effector role of the CB 1 R in the common substrate of two of the most frequent forms of addiction in humans, alcohol and cannabis. Since the relevant role of the CB 1 R in the pharmacological actions in alcohol drinking behaviour and addiction is mainly supported by animal and pharmacological experiments, in Chapter II we investigated changes in CB 1 R availability after chronic alcohol abuse and monitored abstinence in alcoholic patients, and after an acute alcohol administration in healthy social drinkers. We found that, whereas acute exposure to alcohol is related to a (presumably) transient increase in CB 1 R availability, chronic long-term alcohol abuse leads to a significantly decreased CB 1 R availability that is not reversible on the short term as observed after one month of monitored abstinence. Subsequently, to further investigate and elucidate how central CB 1 R availability relates to endocannabinoid levels, we evaluated parallel transient changes in the levels of CB 1 R availability and endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) levels in rats subjected to acute and forced chronic ethanol exposure and then abstinence, using a combined microPET and microdialysis study (Chapter III). This study provided in vivo evidence that acute ethanol consumption is associated with an enhanced endocannabinoid signaling in the nucleus accumbens, indicated by an increased CB 1 R availability and AEA content. In addition, chronic ethanol exposure points to regional dysfunctions in CB 1 R levels, incorporating hippocampus and caudate-putamen that are reversible within two weeks in this animal model. Next, in Chapter IV, we demonstrated that also chronic cannabis use downregulates CB 1 R availability in mainly neocortical regions and this interacts with personality traits involved in addictive behaviour. Secondly, we investigated in vivo CB 1 R availability in an extensive sample of patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), with and without different antipsychotic treatments, and in relation to severity of psychotic symptoms (Chapter V). Compared to controls, both medicated and antipsychotic-free patients show increased CB 1 R availability, particularly pronounced in the nucleus accumbens, cingulate and insular cortex. Moreover the increased CB 1 R availability was negatively associated with negative symptoms and depression in antipsychotic-free patients, especially in the nucleus accumbens. The current in vivo data strengthens the hypothesis that the ECS is involved in the pathology of SCZ. Thirdly, as a stepping stone to study the hypothesis that CB 1 R expression is related to dopaminergic transmission, we developed, applied and optimized an advanced and efficient voxel-based kinetic model (the linearized simplified reference region model [LSRRM]) to detect in vivo striatal and extrastriatal dopamine release using a single [18 F]fallypride imaging protocol during non-pharmacological and pharmacological activation paradigms in human subjects. Using the LSSRM, we measured {{for the first time in}} vivo extrastriatal endogenous dopamine release in healthy humans while they were performing a learning reward task and a validated stress task (Chapter VI and Chapter VII). Next, to estimate the ability of the LSRRM model to quantitate dopamine release simultaneously in both extrastriatal and striatal regions, we analyzed the kinetic characteristics of [18 F]fallypride with variable dopamine stimulus intensity and task timing through simulation studies, starting from the experimental observed parameters during a monetary reward task (Chapter VI). We found that improvements in the experimental design, such as a postponement of task initiation, should increase the relative detection sensitivity of striatal dopamine release, and 120 - 190 min after injection are needed to evaluate both extrastriatal and striatal dopamine release. In addition, using the LSRRM method and the [18 F]fallypride imaging protocol modified according to simulation studies, we wanted to test the hypothesis that Δ 9 -THC increases the risk of developing psychotic symptoms by stimulating striatal dopamine neurotransmission (Chapter VIII). Our results revealed significant striatal dopamine release associated with administration of Δ 9 -THC in both cannabis users with psychotic disorder and first-degree relatives, supporting a dopaminergic mechanism of cannabis-induced psychosis in individuals already at risk for psychosis. The last part of the work focuses on the hypothesis of CB 1 R as in vivo functional modulator of dopamine release capacity in healthy subjects (normodopaminergic state) after a controlled amphetamine administration paradigm (Chapter IX), and in cannabis (psychotic) users (hyperdopaminergic state) after Δ 9 -THC administration (Chapter X). In the last chapter, we additionally investigated whether CB 1 R alterations are present in cannabis users with and without psychotic illness. Although the latter results are preliminary, these data represent the first direct demonstration that CB 1 R is a determinant of dopamine release and they warrant further investigation in dopamine-related transmission disorders, such as addiction or psychosis. Chapter XI critically summarized the findings of this work and tried to provide a coherent interpretation of the overall work, as well as methodological evaluation and suggestions for future work. This work provides new insights on the CB 1 R in dopamine-related psychiatric disorders such as drug addiction and psychosis, and it may lay the basis for novel potential therapeutic strategies that directly or indirectly target the endocannabinoid pathways to modify the process of drug addiction as well as to treat psychotic symptoms.
