The drawing machine pulls or draws the remaining unreduced section of the bar or coil through the die. The die reduces the cross section of the original bar or coil, shapes the profile of the product and increases the length of the original product.|$|E

The results show that, with increasing drawing strain, the spheroidizing annealing temperature and time decreased and uniformity of the spheroidizing increased; the mechanism of low-temperature spheroidizing annealing {{was different from the}} traditional one of heavily <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> pearlite steel wires. When the true strains were between 2. 85 and 5. 1, the spheroidizing process of carbide could be divided into two stages: partial dissolution of lamellar carbide, and the precipitation and accumulation of compulsory dissolved cementite.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} chain tilt in poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fibers was proposed.

In the stacking structure of irregular folded chain blocks of <b>cold</b> <b>drawn</b> PET, the expansion to the chain direction and the contraction to the lateral direction yield the compressive stress and tensile stress r respectively. The stress revealed {{as the result of}} the ordering from the glassy structure to crystalline structure can be relaxed by the rotation of the resulting crystallites.

It is inferred that diffusion controlled boundary migration is operational during rapid heating as the apparent activation energies for the deformed-recrystallised interfaces {{are close to the}} activation energy for the self-diffusion of beta-Ti. Compared to the newly nucleated grains, the increase in the apparent activation energy of the growing grains suggests solute drag effects during the growth stage.
