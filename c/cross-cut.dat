40|$|Ductile sheared {{rocks of}} the Higher Himalayan Crystalline unit (HHC) in micro-scale reveal {{flanking}} microstructures defined by nucleated minerals (the <b>cross-cutting</b> elements, CEs), and deflected cleavages and grain margins (the host Fabric elements, HEs) of other minerals. Depending on different {{or the same}} senses of drag across the <b>cross-cutting</b> elements, the flanking microstructures are grouped into Type 1 or Type 2 varieties, respectively. <b>Cross-cutting</b> elements of Type 2 flanking microstructures connote post-tectonic directional growth. The <b>cross-cutting</b> elements of the Type I flanking microstructures consistently demonstrate top-to-SW non-coaxial shearing in the Higher Himalayan Crystalline unit. Here the external host fabric elements bounding the <b>cross-cutting</b> elements act as the C-planes. These <b>cross-cutting</b> element minerals are usually parallelogram-shaped, underwent crystal-plastic deformation and their nucleations are pre- or syntectonic. The facts that the host fabric elements are dragged even in absence of rheological softening at {{the boundaries of the}} <b>cross-cutting</b> elements, and that the <b>cross-cutting</b> elements are non-rigid, indicate strong bonds between the host fabric elements and the <b>cross-cutting</b> elements. Salient morphological variations in the flanking microstructures are: (1) variable intensity and senses of drag along the single and the opposite crosscutting element margins; (2) host fabric elements defined only at one side of the <b>cross-cutting</b> elements; and (3) presence of a thin hazy zone at the HE-CE contacts. The observed <b>cross-cutting</b> element minerals are either of nearly the same or of greater competency than the mineral grains which host them...|$|R

In these areas a motorised infrastructure is being developed alongside motorisation of the population.

At a beach, dominantly denser sediment such as sand or gravel, often mingled with shell fragments, is deposited, while the silt and clay sized material {{is kept in}} mechanical suspension. Tidal flats and shoals are places that sometimes dry because of the tide. They are often <b>cross-cut</b> by gullies, where the current is strong and the grain size of the deposited sediment is larger. Where rivers enter the body of water, either on a sea or lake coast, deltas can form. These are large accumulations of sediment transported from the continent to places {{in front of the}} mouth of the river. Deltas are dominantly composed of clastic sediment (in contrast to chemical).|$|E

25|$|The Greenside smelt mill {{was built}} in 182728, down in the Glenridding valley {{at the bottom of}} the Swart Beck, where there was a good water supply and where fuel could be brought up the valley without too much difficulty. Inside the mill there was {{probably}} a furnace to prepare the ore and a single ore hearth. The air blast was produced by bellows powered by a water wheel. Further buildings were erected in the 1830s, to house a slag hearth furnace, and a silver refinery. There was no extended chimney: clouds of toxic lead oxides and acid sulphurous fumes would have made the valley an unhealthy place. The flue {{was built in}} 1841 to a chimney 150m up the hillside; in 1855 it was extended to a chimney on the ridge above. Later, loops were added to increase its length. This long flue not only removed the noxious fumes, it also enabled the lead-rich dust to be recovered and returned to the smelter. The flue was built as a stone-arched cutting, following or cut into the bedrock. This served as a giant prospecting <b>cross-cut</b> and proved there was no extension to the Greenside Vein to the south.|$|E
500|$|Triton {{follows a}} {{retrograde}} and quasi-circular orbit, and {{is thought to}} be a gravitationally captured satellite. It was the second moon in the Solar System that was discovered to have a substantial atmosphere, which is primarily nitrogen with small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. The pressure on Triton's surface is about 14μbar. In 1989 the Voyager 2 spacecraft observed what appeared to be clouds and hazes in this thin atmosphere. Triton is one of the coldest bodies in the Solar System, with a surface temperature of about [...] Its surface is covered by nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and water ices and has a high geometric albedo of more than 70%. The Bond albedo is even higher, reaching up to 90%. Surface features include the large southern polar cap, older cratered planes <b>cross-cut</b> by graben and scarps, as well as youthful features probably formed by endogenic processes like cryovolcanism. Voyager 2 observations revealed a number of active geysers within the polar cap heated by the Sun, which eject plumes to the height of up to 8km. Triton has a relatively high density of about 2g/cm3 indicating that rocks constitute about two thirds of its mass, and ices (mainly water ice) the remaining one third. There may be a layer of liquid water deep inside Triton, forming a subterranean ocean. Because of its retrograde orbit and relative proximity to Neptune (closer than the Moon is to Earth), tidal deceleration is causing Triton to spiral inward, which will lead to its destruction in about 3.6 billion years.|$|E

2500|$|Smith's Shaft was [...] {{into the}} {{footwall}} at the 90Fathom Level, {{so rather than}} extend it any deeper a new shaft was sunk from that level. This was an inclined shaft which followed the dip of the vein. It was sunk in 1910 from a point {{just north of the}} <b>cross-cut</b> at the bottom of Smith's Shaft and was known as the Skip Shaft. It was designed purely for haulage, although a ladderway was put in at the side. The skip was a large steel container with small wheels running on wooden guides. It was lowered to a chute below a working level and wagons of ore were tipped into it. It was then brought up to the 90Fathom Level, tipped up and the ore in it dropped into other wagons to be taken along the <b>cross-cut</b> to Smith's Shaft. The 105Fathom Level was developed from the Skip Shaft in 1911, and in 191718 the shaft was deepened to the 120Fathom Level.

So in 1916 a new cage shaft, later to be known as Murray's Shaft, was begun by extending a sump from the 90Fathom Level, at a point [...] south of the <b>cross-cut</b> from Smith's Shaft. This was another inclined shaft, but it was designed for winding cages so wagons, men and horses could all travel up and down it.

40|$|Requirements such as {{distribution}} or tracing have {{an impact}} on multiple classes in a system. They are <b>cross-cutting</b> requirements, or aspects. Their support is, by necessity, scattered across those multiple classes. A look at an individual class may also show support for <b>cross-cutting</b> requirements tangled up with the core responsibilities of that class. Scattering and tangling make object-oriented software difficult to understand, extend and reuse. Though design is an important activity within the software lifecycle with well-documented benefits, those benefits are reduced when <b>cross-cutting</b> requirements are present. This paper presents a means to mitigate these problems by separating the design of <b>cross-cutting</b> requirements into composition patterns. Composition patterns require extensions to the UML, and are based on a combination of the subjectoriented model for composing separate, overlapping designs, and UML templates. This paper also demonstrates how composition patterns map to one programming model that provides a solution for separation of <b>cross-cutting</b> requirements in code [...] -aspect-oriented programming.
