40|$|Multimedia event {{detection}} (MED) {{has become}} one of the most important visual content analysis tools as the rapid growth of the user generated videos on the Internet. Generally, multimedia data is represented by multiple features and it is difficult to gain better performance for complex event detection with only single feature. However, how to fuse different features effectively is the crucial problem for MED with multiple features. Meanwhile, exploiting multiple features simultaneously in the large-scale scenarios always produces a heavy computational burden. To address these two issues, we propose a self-adaptive multi-feature learning framework with efficient Support Vector Machine (SVM) solver for complex event detection in this paper. Our model is able to utilize multiple features reasonably with an adaptively weighted linear <b>combination</b> <b>manner,</b> which is simple yet effective, according to the various impact that different features on a specific event. In order to mitigate the expensive computational cost, we employ a fast primal SVM solver in the proposed alternating optimization algorithm to obtain the approximate solution with gradient descent method. Extensive experiment results over standard datasets of TRECVID MEDTest 2013 and 2014 demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework on complex event detection...|$|E
40|$|Copper {{toxicosis}} with hepatic copper accumulation {{is associated}} with chronic cholestasis which eventually leads to cirrhosis of the liver. Liver {{is considered to be}} the main site for copper homeostasis in the body, and excess of this transition metal induces apoptotic changes in the hepatocytes followed by cirrhosis which eventually culminates in liver failure. We were interested to find out the underlying mechanism leading to the development of copper toxicity and to find out a short term treatment strategy against it. For this purpose, we have developed an animal model with rats. In the first chapter, we have established the fundamental mechanism of copper toxicity developed in liver of young rats. Chronic exposure to copper induces hepatocellular apoptosis with greater injury in the periportal region compared to the perivenous region. Here we have identified the factors responsible for the development of regional damage in the liver under in vivo conditions. Enhanced production of reactive oxygen species with predominance of superoxide radical indicates the contribution of redox imbalance in the process. This may be linked with copper catalyzed oxidation of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione resulting in the generation of superoxide radical. Downregulation of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in consequence of the degradation of this enzyme, causes decreased dismutation of superoxide radical that further contributes to the enhanced level of superoxide radical in the periportal region. Decreased functioning of manganese superoxide dismutase activity, reduction in mitochondrial thiol/disulphide ratio and generation of superoxide radical were much higher in the mitochondria from periportal region, which point to the involvement of this 2 organelle in the regional hepatotoxicity observed during copper exposure. This was supported by copper-mediated enhanced mitochondrial dysfunction as evident from adenosine triphosphate depletion, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and induction of mitochondrial permeability transition. Results suggest the active participation of superoxide radical in inducing mitochondrial dysfunction preferentially in the periportal region that eventually leads to the development of hepatotoxicity due to copper exposure under in vivo condition. In the second chapter, we have ascertained a treatment schedule with andrographolide and D-penicillamine used in <b>combination</b> <b>manner,</b> which gives a promising result against copper induced liver damage in rats. Copper toxicity results from the cytoplasmic copper accumulation in periportal zone of liver due to intracanalicular cholestasis. We have shown that chronic exposure to copper caused oxidative stress and induced hepatocellular apoptosis in rats leading to periportal fibrosis. Despite several studies on the treatment of copper toxicosis, the result of these experimental therapies to date remains unsatisfactory. D-penicillamine, a metal chelator, still represents the drug of choice for the treatment of copper toxicosis. Long treatment regime and side effects after prolonged use remains a major hindrance to successful treatment with D-penicillamine. Effective short term treatment strategies involve coadministration of this agent with another hepatoprotective drug, andrographolide which is our drug of choice. Andrographolide exerts choleretic and anticholestatic effects and reverts back the cholestasis efficiently. Andrographolide potentiates the cytoprotective effect of D-penicillamine by accentuating the simultaneous removal of copper through bile and urine respectively. So, co-administration of andrographolide with D-penicillamine reduces hepatocyte death. This is accompanied by inhibition of mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and activation of caspase cascade. Toxic events 3 are consequense of oxidative stress and generation of proinflmmatory cytokines, we suggest that the antiapoptotic activity of combination therapy with andrographolide and D-penicillamine can be related to their ability to prevent the liver damage associated with copper toxicosis. To conclude, simultaneous treatment with andrographolide and Dpenicillamine synergistically exert antifibrotic effect and may therefore have a therapeutic implication for reducing copper overload as well as hepatic fibros{{is associated with}} copper toxicosis. A change in the feeding pattern among Indian children is the first option to prevent the development Indian Childhood Cirrhosis. There should be a greater awareness among pediatricians about this disease to enable early diagnosis. Most of the patients are diagnosed at a very late stage of this disease and as a result commonly leads to death. We hope that, the research findings of our study will have a good implication in human society and can be used successfully for the treatment of human population, suffering from copper toxicity in future...|$|E

Indeed, {{while the number of}} potential co-occurring domain sets (CDSs) is very large, only a few of these occur in nature. Here we study the principles governing domain content of proteins, using yeast as a model species. Results We design a novel representation of proteins and their constituent domains as a protein-domain network. An analysis of this network reveals 99 CDSs that occur in proteins more than expected by chance. The identified CDSs are shown to preferentially include ancient domains that are conserved from bacteria or archaea. Moreover, the protein sets spanned by these combinations were found to be highly functionally coherent, significantly match known protein complexes, and enriched with protein-protein interactions. These observations serve to validate the biological significance of the identified CDSs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{evaluated}} the currently available treatment modalities for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: One {{of the most}} common tumors worldwide, HCC has several known risk factors. Untreated HCC typically has a dismal prognosis. Early detection remains the key to successful treatment of this malignancy. Surgical resection has been the mainstay of treatment for HCC, but newer modalities have been recently introduced. METHODS: The authors {{evaluated the}} treatment modalities for HCC. RESULTS: Surgical resection affords 5 -year survival rates as high as 45 % with more favorable subgroups having 1) small tumors, 2) well-differentiated tumors, 3) unifocal tumors, 4) lack of vascular invasion, 5) absence of cirrhosis, and 6) the fibrolamellar variant (FL-HCC). Resection has been limited primarily by low resectability rates and recurrent disease. Newer therapeutic modalities that appear the most promising are transarterial chemoembolization and percutaneous ethanol injection. Neither therapy has been evaluated in a prospective randomized <b>manner.</b> <b>Combination</b> chemotherapy and surgical intervention may provide the best results, but randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up are needed. As single-treatment modalities, radiation therapy, intravenous chemotherapy, intra-arterial chemotherapy, and immunotherapy play limited palliative roles. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection in the form of partial or total hepatectomy is the preferred treatment for HCC. The early detection of tumors by screening high-risk populations is crucial.

After verification of kindling in animals, treatment was performed with PEA, AM 251 and AM 630 in different groups. Latency to induce seizure, seizure stages and latency and duration of fifth stage of seizure was recorded for each animal. Injection of PTZ led to seizure in the animals. Pretreatment with PEA increased the latency to initiate seizures and reduced the duration of seizure.

While verbs such as sit, stand, sleep refer to eventualities in the sense of Davidson (= Davidsonian states), the states denoted by such stative verbs like know, weigh,and own, as well as any combination of copula plus predicate are of a different ontological type (= Kimian states). Against this background, the present study assesses the two main arguments that have been raised in favour of a Davidsonian approach for statives. These are the <b>combination</b> with certain <b>manner</b> adverbials and Parsons (2000) so-called time travel argument. It will be argued that the manner data which, at first sight, seem to provide evidence for a Davidsonian approach to statives are better analysed as non-compositional reinterpretations triggered by the lack of a regular Davidsonian event argument. As for Parsons´s time travel argument, it turns out that the original version does not supply the kind of support for the Davidsonian approach that Parsons supposed. However, properly adapted, the time travel argument may provide additional evidence for the need of reifying the denotatum of statives, as suggested by the assumption of Kimian states...|$|R

When the hyperthermia was combined with various concentrations of ADM ranging from 0. 005 to 0. 1 microgram/ml and BLM from 0. 01 to 1. 0 microgram/ml, enhanced cell killing effects were obtained at {{the concentration of}} less than 0. 02 microgram/ml of ADM and with an increase of BLM concentration. In DNA specimens obtained from the livers of chick embryos inoculated with human tumor cultivated cells, the polymerase chain reaction technique was used to amplify a DNA fragment specific to the beta-globin gene. By detecting these amplified DNA fragments, the feasibility of efficiently detecting metastatic cells present in chick embryo was demonstrated in vivo. Hyperthermic therapy showed inhibitory effects on the growth of metastasized cultivated cells in a thermal dose-dependent <b>manner.</b> <b>Combination</b> therapy of ADM, mitomycin and carboplatin and hyperthermia had an enhanced inhibitory activity on the growth of metastasized cultivated human tumor cells derived from bladder cancer. Hyperthermia using radiofrequency-capacitive heating in combination with irradiation or anticancer agents, was performed {{in a total of}} 56 patients with T 2 to T 4 invasive urinary bladder cancer.

He began his musical career with many rock/jazz bands, jazz {{ensembles}} and large orchestras, performing throughout the former Yugoslavia. During the 1970s he {{became a member of}} the Revival Orchestra of the Radio Television Priština. In 1979 Sinan moved to Sarajevo, where he developed a musical activity, primarily as a member of the rhythm section of the Great Orchestra (Big Band) of the Radio Television Sarajevo, but also as an arranger, composer and conductor. Soon he met :bs:Slobodan Kovačević and {{became a member of the}} rock'n'roll group Indexi. In 1981, at the “Vaš Šlager Sezone” festival he won the award for the best arrangement of the composition Betonska Brana, which was composed together with the guitarist Slobodan Bodo Kovačević. In 1983. Sinan left the group Indexi. In 1997 Sinan again joins them and remains in the group until the death of the singer - Davorin Popović. In the 1980s he collaborates with many cult groups of Sarajevo rock’n’roll school such as Bijelo dugme, Ambasadori, and many others. However, his main interest is jazz and in his music the audience can feel a great influence of cult musicians and band’s such as Weather Report, Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, Wynton Kelly, etc. Compositions by Sinan Alimanović, composed in that time, are characterized by specific rhythmic measures close to the Balkans but in <b>combination</b> with the <b>manner</b> of jazz and the unique sound of the Fender Rhodes or Organ.|$|R

However, interspecies the ability of alveolar macrophages (AM) to express the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and to generate NO. The purpose of this study was to compare iNOS expression and NO production by rat, hamster, monkey, and human AM using the identical experimental conditions in vitro. As AM donors, CD rats, Syrian golden hamsters, cynomolgus monkeys, and nonsmoking, healthy human volunteers were used. The AM were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and stimulated in vitro with various concentrations and combinations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-y (IFN-y). The oxidation product of NO, nitrite, was measured in the AM supernatant by the Griess reaction. The expression of iNOS in AM was detected using immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. The expression of iNOS mRNA was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rat AM, stimulated with either LPS or IFN-y, produced nitrite in a time- and dose-dependent <b>manner.</b> <b>Combination</b> of LPS and IFN-y resulted in a significantly enhanced nitrite formation. However, none of the treatments was able to induce hamster, monkey, or human AM to release measurable amounts of nitrite. Whereas expression of iNOS protein was only detected in stimulated rat AM, expression of iNOS mRNA was found in unstimulated and stimulated rat AM, slightly in stimulated hamster AM, but not in monkey and human AM. In conclusion, our findings point to distinct regulatory mechanisms of the NO pathway in AM from these four different species.

Here {{we report}} on the design and antitu-mor activity, in monotherapy as well as in combination therapy with cytotoxic agents, of a novel class of non-thiol-containing peptidomimetic inhibitors of FTase and the closely related family member geranylgera-nyltransferase I (GGTase I). The non-thiol-containing FTI- 2148 is highly selective for FTase (IC 50, 1. 4 nM) over GGTase I (IC 50, 1700 nM), whereas GGTI- 2154 is highly selective for GGTase I (21 nM) over FTase (IC 50, 5600 nM). In whole cells, the corresponding methylester prodrug FTI- 2153 is> 3000 -fold more potent at inhibiting H-Ras (IC 50, 10 nM) than Rap 1 A processing, whereas GGTI- 2166 is over 100 -fold more selective at inhib-iting Rap 1 A (IC 50, 300 nM) over H-Ras processing. Furthermore, FTI- 2153 was highly effective at suppressing oncogenic H-Ras constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and human tumor growth in soft agar. FTI- 2148 suppressed the growth of the human lung adeno-carcinoma A- 549 cells in nude mice by 33, 67, and 91 % in a dose-dependent <b>manner.</b> <b>Combination</b> therapy of FTI- 2148 with either cispla-tin, gemcitabine, or Taxol resulted in a greater antitumor efficacy than monotherapy.

40|$|To {{search for}} novel {{strategies}} {{to enhance the}} tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) -induced apoptosis pathways in glioblastoma, we used the B-cell lymphoma 2 /Bcl 2 -like 2 -inhibitor ABT- 737. Here we report that ABT- 737 and TRAIL cooperate to induce apoptosis in several glioblastoma cell lines in a highly synergistic <b>manner</b> (<b>combination</b> index < 0. 1). Interestingly, the concerted action of ABT- 737 and TRAIL to trigger the accumulation of truncated Bid (tBid) at mitochondrial membranes is identified as a key underlying mechanism. ABT- 737 and TRAIL cooperate to cleave BH 3 -interacting domain death agonist (Bid) into its active fragment tBid, leading to increased accumulation of tBid at mitochondrial membranes. Coinciding with tBid accumulation, the activation of Bcl 2 -associated X protein (Bax), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome-c and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac) into the cytosol and caspase activation are strongly increased in cotreated cells. Of note, knockdown of Bid significantly decreases ABT- 737 - and TRAIL-mediated Bax activation and apoptosis. Also, caspase- 3 silencing reduces ABT- 737 - and TRAIL-induced Bid cleavage and apoptosis, indicating that a caspase- 3 -driven, mitochondrial feedback loop contributes to Bid processing. Importantly, ABT- 737 profoundly enhances TRAIL-triggered apoptosis in primary cultured glioblastoma cells derived from tumor material, underlining the clinical relevance. Also, ABT- 737 acts in concert with TRAIL to suppress tumor growth in an in vivo glioblastoma model. In conclusion, the rational combination of ABT- 737 and TRAIL cooperates to trigger tBid mitochondrial accumulation and apoptosis. This approach presents a promising strategy for targeting the apoptosis pathways in glioblastoma, which warrants further investigation...|$|R

Oncolytic viruses with genetic modifications can further enhance the oncolytic effects on tumor cells and stimulate antitumor immunity. The oncolytic vaccinia viruses JX- 594 -GFP+/hGM-CSF (JX-GFP) and TG 6002 are genetically modified by secreting granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or transforming 5 -fluorocytosine (5 -FC) into 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU). We compared their properties to kill tumor cells and induce an immunogenic type of cell {{death in a}} human melanoma cell model using SK 29 -MEL melanoma cells. Their influence on human immune cells, specifically regarding the activation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the interaction with the autologous cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone, was investigated. Melanoma cells were infected with either JX-GFP or TG 6002 alone or in combination with 5 -FC and 5 -FU. The influence of viral infection on cell viability followed a time- and multiplicity of infection dependent <b>manner.</b> <b>Combination</b> of virus treatment with 5 -FU resulted in stronger reduction of cell viability. TG 6002 in combination with 5 -FC did not significantly strengthen the reduction of cell viability in this setting. Expression of calreticulin and high mobility group 1 protein (HMGB 1), markers of immunogenic cell death (ICD), could be detected after viral infection. Accordingly, DC maturation was noted after viral oncolysis. DCs presented stronger expression of activation and maturation markers. The autologous CTL clone IVSB expressed the activation marker CD 69, but viral treatment failed to enhance cytotoxicity marker. In summary, vaccinia viruses JX-GFP and TG 6002 lyse melanoma cells and induce additional immunostimulatory effects to promote antitumor immune response. Further investigation in vivo is needed to consolidate the data. Keywords: oncolytic virus, vaccinia virus, immunogenic cell death, dendritic cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, immunotherap...|$|R
40|$|This project {{searches}} for consistent acoustic attributes {{in a broad}} set of American English consonants that would help in identifying their word positions in running speech. A database of sentences containing word pairs (e. g. "lay keys" vs. "lake ease" for /k/) of thirteen consonants (six stops, two affricates, three fricatives, and two nasals), controlled for prosodic boundaries, pitch accents, phonetic contexts, and word positions (initial vs. final), was recorded from six speakers. On the assumption that consonants might be articulated differently at word onsets, several temporal and spectral measurements were made and contrasted {{as a function of}} word position. The relatively simple measurement of duration did quite well in distinguishing word-initial (being longer) from word-final positions in our database. For stops and affricates at word onsets, speakers are found to lengthen closure and release durations differently, depending on voicing, suggesting that enhancement of paradigmatic contrast is made for these consonants. The identity of the following vowel (/i/ or /o/) had no consistent effect on the durations of the consonants. Word-initial consonants were found to be less variable than word-final ones, supporting the claim that word onsets are perceptual "islands of reliability" in the lexical access process. Durations of word-onset consonants were relatively constant within each sound class (voicing, stops, affricates, fricatives, nasals), independent of place of articulation. By using acoustic landmarks, from which information about manner as well as durations can be easily extracted, word segmentation and/or lexical access processes can start without the complete identification of all features (such as place) for a particular segment. (cont.) Acoustic landmarks can thus be used either singly, in identifying acoustically interesting regions where place features can be identified, or in <b>combinations,</b> from which <b>manner</b> features (Park, 2008) and temporal elations can be derived, to drive higher-level processing (e. g. word segmentation and lexical access) of the speech signal. by Xuemin Chi.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the development, validation, {{and application of}} a hybrid microscopy technique to study cell-substrate and cell-cell interactions in a controlled and quantitative manner. We studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of the selected membrane molecules CD 6 and the activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), since they appear {{to play an important}} role in T-cell activation in the immune system. To obtain detailed information on interaction dynamics of cell membrane molecules, we combined total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (using an evanescent field to illuminate the sample) with optical tweezers (OT) to align the interaction site in the focal plane of the microscope objective and to visualize the interactions from the precise timepoint of onset of these processes. We demonstrated that the combination of prism-based TIRF microscopy with optical tweezers yields a versatile hybrid method to study cell-substrate interactions. We described the method developed in detail and presented its application to study the interaction of K 562 cells, stably expressing GFP-tagged ALCAM with a CD 6 -functionalized surface. We showed that K 562 -ALCAM-GFP cells spread on the surface in accordance with an existing model. Additionally, we described an active redistribution of ALCAM upon contact initiation. We further used the hybrid TIRF-OT method to investigate the CD 6 -induced cell spreading and recruitment of CD 6 towards the contact site in the interaction between Jurkat-CD 6 -RFP cells and a functionalized surface. We showed that Jurkat-CD 6 -RFP cells spread on anti-CD 6 functionalized surfaces in an active process with a possible role for the actin cytoskeleton. We also measured recruitment of CD 6 towards the contact site on anti-CD 6 and non-CD 6 specific functionalized surfaces. This recruitment is also an active process. Furthermore, we tested three manipulation and three visualization methods to measure cell-cell interactions in a controlled and quantitative <b>manner.</b> <b>Combinations</b> of highly inclined laminated optical sheet (HILO) microscopy with OT and confocal microscopy with a micropipette are both able to induce contact between two cells in a controlled way, while simultaneously monitoring the interaction site in the field of view...|$|R
