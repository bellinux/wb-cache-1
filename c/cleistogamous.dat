2500|$|Certain {{plants in}} {{particular}} seasons might produce closed, self-pollinating (<b>cleistogamous)</b> flowers; {{but the same}} plant or species might produce open, insect-pollinated flowers elsewhere or at a different time of year, and with no obvious pattern. [...] Sometimes, individual plants have both types of flower at the same time: aquatic species such as U. dimorphantha and U. geminiscapa, for example, usually have open flowers riding clear {{of the water and}} one or more closed, self-pollinating flowers beneath the water. Seeds are numerous and small and for the majority of species are as small as 0.2mm to 1mm long.|$|E

These occur in no less than fifty-five different genera, belonging to twenty-four natural orders, and in thirty-two of these genera the normal flowers are irregular, and have therefore been specially modified for insect fertilisation.[152] These flowers appear to be degradations of the normal flowers, and are closed up by various modifications of the petals or other parts, {{so that it is}} impossible for insects to reach the interior, yet they produce seed in abundance, and are often the chief means by which the species is continued. Thus, in our common dog-violet the perfect flowers rarely produce seed, while the rudimentary cleistogamic flowers do so in abundance. The sweet violet also produces abundance of seed from its cleistogamic flowers, and few from its perfect flowers; but in Liguria it produces only perfect flowers which seed abundantly. No case appears to be known of a plant which has cleistogamic flowers only, but a small rush (Juncus bufonius) is in this condition in some parts of Russia, while in other parts perfect flowers are also produced.[153] Our common henbit dead-nettle (Lamium amplexicaule) produces cleistogamic flowers, as do also some orchids. The advantage gained by the plant is great economy of specialised material, since with very small flowers and very little expenditure of pollen an abundance of seed is produced.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to chasmogamous flowers, are minute, bud-like <b>cleistogamous</b> ("closed marriage") flowers, and pollination of <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers is cleistogamy. Unlike chasmogamous flowers, <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers remain mechanically sealed throughout {{the entirety of}} their development and reproduction. The closed morphology of <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers hinders them from exposing their reproductive organs and forces self-pollination. Without the need for pollinating agents, <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers lack nectar and elaborate petals, making them much less costly to produce than chasmogamous flowers and developmentally favored in suboptimal conditions.|$|E

50|$|Caladenia cleistantha is a {{plant in}} the orchid family Orchidaceae and is endemic to the {{south-east}} of Australia. It is a ground orchid which occurs as solitary plants and has a singly hairy leaf {{and one or two}} <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers.

5000|$|The {{more common}} {{opposite}} of cleistogamy, or [...] "closed marriage," [...] is called chasmogamy, or [...] "open marriage." [...] Virtually all plants that produce <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers also produce chasmogamous ones. [...] The principal advantage of cleistogamy {{is that it}} requires less plant resources to produce seeds than does chasmogamy because development of petals, nectar and large amounts of pollen are not required. This efficiency makes cleistogamy particularly useful for seed production on unfavorable sites or adverse conditions. Impatiens capensis, for example, has been observed to produce only <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers after being severely damaged by grazing and to maintain populations on unfavorable sites with only <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers. The obvious disadvantage of cleistogamy is that self-fertilization occurs, which may suppress the creation of genetically superior plants.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to chasmogamy and cleistogamy, many plant species possess a mixed breeding system that utilizes both chasmogamous and <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers. This breeding {{system has been}} referred to under multiple names including true cleistogamy, dimorphic cleistogamy, and the chasmogamous/cleistogamous mixed breeding system. In this mixed breeding system, species produce both chasmogamous and <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers on the same plant. Chasmogamous and <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers may exhibit spatial separation and develop simultaneously at different morphological locations, or the two flowers may be temporally separated and develop at different times during the flowering season. Rarely, the two flowers have also been documented as being both spatially and temporally separated. The presence of both flower types allows mixed breeding system species to cross-pollinate and self-fertilize. This leads to increases in genetic diversity and assures reproductive success in variable environmental and pollinator conditions.|$|E
50|$|Frailea is a genus of {{globular}} {{to short}} cylindrical cacti native to Brazil. These species are <b>cleistogamous.</b> They were first {{classified in the}} genus Echinocactus.|$|E
50|$|The {{grass is}} {{wind-pollinated}} {{but is also}} sometimes <b>cleistogamous,</b> so that the flowers pollinate themselves, especially under stressful conditions. It also reproduces vegetatively via tillers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cleistogamous</b> {{flowers are}} self-pollinated, {{after which they}} may or may not open. Many Viola and some Salvia species are known to have these types of flowers.|$|E
50|$|Self-seeding freely, in {{lawns and}} gardens {{it can become}} a weed. <b>Cleistogamous</b> seed heads may also appear on short stems in late summer and early autumn.|$|E
50|$|Flowers of Acleisanthes crassifolia are chasmogamous or <b>cleistogamous.</b> Petals of corolla in <b>Cleistogamous</b> {{flowers are}} green and 2-6 mm long. The petals of corolla of chasmogamous flowers are white, {{projected}} outward and {{shaped like a}} funnel, 5-lobed petals that are 8-25mm wide. The fruits are 5-angled, elongated and oval shaped, 6-9 mm long and 3-4 mm wide, minutely narrow at both ends, has light longitudinally concaved lines along with 5 wide low ribs without resinous glands, fruit body surface has small white hairs that are pressed towards the body.|$|E
50|$|It is an epiphytic orchid. The {{flowers are}} peloric; the blunt, linear-elliptic sepals and petals are 1 cm long; the {{labellum}} is undifferentiated. The whole population {{is presumed to}} be <b>cleistogamous.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{flowers are}} self-pollinated and use flowers that never open or are self-pollinated before the flowers open, these flowers are called <b>cleistogamous.</b> Many Viola species and some Salvia have {{these types of}} flowers.|$|E
50|$|Dalibarda repens is a {{herbaceous}} plant with simple leaves, and hairy stems. It {{is the only}} species in the genus Dalibarda. It has both sterile and fertile flowers. The sterile flowers are much less numerous than the fertile ones, have five white petals and are borne atop a peduncle. The more numerous fertile flowers are <b>cleistogamous</b> (they are self-pollinating and never open), and are hidden beneath the leaves. The flower stalks (peduncles) of the <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers are short, 2 - 5 cm long, and curved downward. The calyx forms a shallow, hairy hypanthium, which is divided into 5 - 6 lobes of unequal size, the 3 larger lobes are toothed (serrate).|$|E
50|$|Nassella leucotricha is {{species is}} a {{perennial}} bunchgrass with stems up to 1.2 m tall. There {{are two types}} of flowers, opening flowers and <b>cleistogamous</b> (non-opening) flowers that self-pollinate and are sometimes tucked away in the leaf sheaths.|$|E
50|$|Cleistogamy {{is a type}} of {{automatic}} self-pollination of certain plants that can propagate by using non-opening, self-pollinating flowers. Especially well known in peanuts, peas, and beans, this behavior is most widespread in the grass family. However, the largest genus of <b>cleistogamous</b> plants is actually Viola.|$|E
50|$|Viola {{are most}} often spring {{blooming}} with chasmogamous flowers with well-developed petals pollinated by insects. Many species also produce self-pollinated <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers in summer and autumn that do not open and lack petals. In some species the showy chasmogamous flowers are infertile (e.g.,Viola papilionacea).|$|E
5000|$|Lake populations {{predominantly}} {{occur on}} silty or peaty substrates, growing at depths up {{to at least}} 3.5m. In deeper water it reproduces vegetatively by stolons or production of <b>cleistogamous</b> seed. This often results in populations with low genetic diversity. Shallow water populations produce short-lived flowers which may cross-pollinate.|$|E
5000|$|Plowmanianthus resembles {{its close}} relative, the epiphytic genus Cochliostema, but is smaller (its leaves reach only to ca. 30 cm in length) {{and is not}} epiphytic. Its flowers are also much smaller, lack the spirally coiled anthers of Cochliostema, and are usually <b>cleistogamous</b> (i.e., they usually never open).|$|E
50|$|Gastrodia kuroshimensis is {{an unusual}} species of plant that was {{discovered}} in April, 2016. It is mycoheterotrophic, meaning {{that it does not}} engage in photosynthesis like most plants but obtains energy from its host fungi. It is also <b>cleistogamous,</b> meaning that it produces flowers that never bloom. Since its flowers never bloom, it is self-fertilizing.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of flowers, blooms that open and <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers that remain closed and self-pollinate. The flower color is variable. Environmental factors may cause variation; flowers growing at higher {{elevations}} have less color in the veins on the petals, while the veins of those at lower elevations have a deeper pink-purple coloration.|$|E
5000|$|Caladenia cleistantha {{was first}} {{formally}} described by David L. Jones in 1991 and the description {{was published in}} Australian Orchid Research. The type specimen was collected on Gabo Island. The specific epithet (cleistantha) {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek words kleistos meaning [...] "shut" [...] or [...] "closed" [...] and anthos meaning [...] "flower", referring to the <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers.|$|E
50|$|This annual herb grows prostrate, spreading, or erect stems. It {{grows up}} to 40 centimeters tall. The leaves {{are made up}} of three oval leaflets. Flowers occur in the leaf axils. There are <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers, which self-fertilize and never open, and chasmogamous flowers, which open and receive pollen from other plants. The fruit is a small legume pod {{containing}} one seed.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves and}} tiny purple-tinted white flowers may be submersed or not. When the flowers grow {{underwater}} they are <b>cleistogamous,</b> meaning they stay closed and self-pollinate. When the flowers grow above water they open. The leaves {{above the surface}} are stiff and wide, but submerged leaves are ribbon-like. The fruit is a ring of dry nutlets. Reproduction is by seed or from division of the corm.|$|E
5000|$|About 42% of {{flowering}} plants exhibit a mixed mating system in nature. [...] In {{the most common}} kind of system, individual plants produce a single flower type and fruits may contain self-pollinated, out-crossed or a mixture of progeny types. Another mixed mating system {{is referred to as}} dimorphic cleistogamy. In this system a single plant produces both open, potentially out-crossed and closed, obligately self-pollinated <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers.|$|E
50|$|Corallorhiza odontorhiza is a non-photosynthetic species, with no chlorophyll. Hence {{it relies}} on fungi in the soil to supply it with nutrients. Stems are yellow to brown, bulbous at the base. There are no leaves. Flowers are {{typically}} reddish-purple with a white lip, the lip with small purple spots, though some plants are <b>cleistogamous</b> with non-opening flowers. The plant flowers from August through October in the eastern US.|$|E
50|$|The plant {{produces}} {{two types}} of flowers. Submerged <b>cleistogamous</b> flowers remain closed and self-pollinate, and flowers that bloom above {{the surface of the}} water open into white blossoms and may cross with other individuals. Because it often pollinates itself, the species has a low genetic diversity. Seeds are produced in the water but they require open air for germination, so they sprout when the wetland has dried in the fall.|$|E
