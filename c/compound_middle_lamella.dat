In the secondary wall, larger compressive growth stress was associated with higher lignin concentration especially in the outer part. This finding confirms that lignin contributes positively to the generation of compressive longitudinal growth stresses in the compression wood and more substantially in the outer part of the secondary wall.

The tangential, radial and longitudinal swelling was measured and volumetric swelling of oven-dried samples was determined. The synergic effects of swelling in aqueous solutions were observed. The properties of binary liquid systems have a major influence on the swelling of wood. Microscopy studies of wood samples show that after swelling in water the cells are densely packed and the <b>compound</b> <b>middle</b> <b>lamellae</b> (CML) has arranged in a form of continuous ribbon around the cells. The swelling of wood in ethanol-water mixtures has a dramatic effect on the wood structure through dissolving a main part of lignin from CML and released individual cells at sectioning.

It has been demonstrated that when [C 2 mim][Cl] is used to treat Japanese cedar, separation and destruction of wood cells occur selectively in latewood, and that cellulose within wood is amorphized while maintaining the tissue structure of wood [33, 34]. This behavior is attributable to the significant swelling that occurs after an ionic liquid treatment has been performed; this swelling {{is caused by the}} presence of thicker tracheid cell walls in latewood compared with those in earlywood. However, in cases where hardwood samples such as beech wood, were similarly treated, destruction similar to those observed in Japanese cedar were not observed, although the swelling behaviors of vessels and wood fibers were found to differ from one another [35, 36]. Additionally, in cases where 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate [C 2 mim][Ac] was used, similar changes were observed in the wood samples [37]. Moreover, when Japanese cedar was treated with [C 2 mim][Cl], topochemical evaluations based on Raman microscopy clarified that although cellulose and hemicellulose in wood cells could be relatively uniformly dissolved, lignin in the cell walls was dissolved first and the lignin in the <b>compound</b> <b>middle</b> <b>lamellae</b> and cell corners was stabilized and remained as a residue [38].

Brightness measurements revealed significant distinctions between the preparations. The final brightness of the main part of eucalyptus kraft pulp fibers reached 67 %, while the brightness of the surface layers attained only 50 % ISO. Similar results were obtained for birch organosolv pulp. It was concluded that the main reason for the described phenomena is the discordant chemical composition of the different fiber wall layers...|$|E

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} has been {{developed}} that describes the decrease in firmness of ‘Elstar’ apples during different types of conditions, based on the general knowledge how firmness is affected by chemical and biochemical reactions, and on the strict and consistent application of fundamental kinetics. The variable part of the firmness of apples is deduced to depend mainly on the pectic <b>compounds</b> in the <b>middle</b> <b>lamellae.</b> These pectic <b>compounds</b> are supposed to decay during storage in two distinct routes, one consuming/needing oxygen and one occurring with or without oxygen. Depending on the gas conditions (oxygen and carbon dioxide) the respiration rate of apples change. This respiration affects {{the rate of the}} oxygen consuming pectin degradation. The moment of harvest defines among other, the initial climacteric stage of the apples. Depending on the relative respiration rate, the rate of development of the climacteric stage changes. The climacteric stage in itself affects the rate of pectin decay: preclimacteric apples can be kept longer than climacteric ones. During CA or MA storage, an enzyme, probably polygalacturonase, accumulates depending on the length of the CA/MA period: the longer kept at CA/MA conditions, the faster firmness decays {{at the end of the}} storage period. On top of all those interactions, a temperature dependence is applied on all individual reaction rates. This temperature dependence is described by the well know Arrhenius law. The model can be applied to predict the firmness of ‘Elstar’ apples during all kinds of scenarios encountered in practice, to get an impression of the expected final firmness when reaching the consumer...|$|R
