5000|$|A delay at Havana, {{including}} {{a change of}} ships and a threatened search consequent of suspicions of French’s connection to the López filibuster, resulted in missing their ship connection in New Orleans. This meant a further delay of nearly a week. French put the men up in the best hotels available and all lived well in New Orleans - on French - as the month of May ended. [...] On June4, French and the additional recruits arrived at Port Lavaca. Those stranded there for nearly a month greeted him {{with a mixture of}} relief and fury. When the new arrivals discovered the absence of mules, they, too, became much concerned. French, often described as remarkably persuasive, convinced the crowd that all would be well. He purchased young and unbroken mules somewhere, and, after much more delay, they finally made it to San Antonio via Victoria on July 6. There, as he had in Victoria, French produced such papers as military orders, bank drafts, and an unlimited line of <b>credit</b> <b>drawn</b> on a major New York shipping firm. All of it was bogus. He refurbished, re-supplied, bought horses, cattle, and many, better, mules. New recruits signed up. The train of 33 colorful, individually named wagons left San Antonio with much fanfare in mid-July. The sixty days promised for the entire trip had expired and San Diego was still 1,500 miles away.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} This paper investigates two conjectures from the theoretical literature on financial intermediation concerning the special role of banks in financing opaque {{and small business}} and thus fostering growth. The first is that more opaque firms borrow preferably from banks that should be better at collecting and processing soft information, i. e. small banks, banks that specialize in relationship-based lending, and banks that {{are close to the}} firm’s headquarters. The second is that the comparative advantage these banks have in screening and monitoring opaque borrowers should be reflected in the characteristics of the credit relationships they develop with such borrowers. The first step of the analysis consists of estimating the probability of a specific bank-firm matching, characterizing banks by size, specialization in small business lending and proximity. The second step estimates the effect of the bank-firm matching on the ratio of <b>credit</b> <b>drawn</b> from credit lines – an inverse measure of credit availability- and the amount of collateral posted, accounting for the non-randomness of the matching between banks and firms. The analysis is performed on very large data set of bank-firm credit relationships including virtually the universe of nonfinancial firms borrowing a positive quantity of credit from Italian banks in one year...|$|E

40|$|The Vasicek {{single factor}} model of {{portfolio}} credit loss is generalized to include correlated stochastic exposures and loss rates. The new model can accommodate any distribution and correlation assumptions {{for the loss}} and exposure rates of individual credits and will produce a closed-form approximation for an asymptotic portfolio’s conditional loss rate. Revolving exposures are modeled as draws against committed lines of <b>credit.</b> <b>Draw</b> rates and loss rates on defaulted credits are random variables with known probability distributions. Dependence among defaults, individual exposures, and loss rates are modeled using a single common Gaussian factor. A closed-form expression for an asymptotic portfolio’s inverse cumulative conditional loss rate {{is used to calculate}} a portfolio’s unconditional loss rate distribution, estimate economic capital allocations, and analyze portfolio loss rate characteristics. Positive correlation in individual credit exposures and loss rates increases systematic risk. As a consequence, portfolio loss rate distributions exhibit wider ranges and greater skewness...|$|R
40|$|While {{there are}} {{numerous}} histories of major Australian banks, the extant literature {{on the history of}} the Australian financial service sector pays only incidental attention to the role of finance companies and other non-bank financial institutions in the sector's long-term transformation, particularly the expansion of consumer <b>credit.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on Chandler's classic insights on the dynamics of firm strategy and structure, this paper focuses on the growth and development of one particular finance company - Industrial Acceptance Corporation (IAC) - between the 1920 s and 1970 s. IAC began as a subsidiary of a US finance company and grew to become one of Australia's leading and innovative finance companies. Based on hire purchase for automobiles and other consumer durables, it diversified into property development during the late 1960 s. Imprudent lending practices concerning property development led to financial difficulties in the mid- 1970 s and ultimately its full takeover by US banking giant, Citibank, in 1977. hire purchase, consumer finance, property development, Morris Plan, Industrial Acceptance Corporation, Citibank,...|$|R
40|$|Macro {{stress tests}} {{has become a}} part of the tools for testing the ability of the {{financial}} system to withstand unexpected shocks and now it is increasingly used in developing the corporate strategy. Theoretical and methodological parts were focused on explaining the process of macro stress testing and on particular decision-making steps in the implementation of macro stress tests to the individual portfolio. The results of the financial stability testing are the significant source of information for companies. Mainly, in this project there was evaluated the importance of macro stress tests in the preliminary phase of the business (after-tax return of equity), in the case of the creation of the operating plan (non-performing loans ratios in selected branches), in the planning of customer-supplier relationships (nominal and real income growth, the unemployment rate and employment growth, household debts and over indebtedness) and in financial and operational corporate planning (capital adequacy ratios, <b>credits</b> <b>drawn</b> from bank and non-bank institutions) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} how contract conditions in licensing agreements between Poland and the industrialized market-economy countries influence the long-term effects of imports of modern technology. Analysis is confined to two essential aspects of this problem. The first concerns the effects of the diffusion of modern technical solutions throughout the whole economy. Unlike technology purchases by individual western enterprises, technology imports in a planned economy are considered as a source of modernization of entire branches or industries, and not only of certain enterprises. The second issue dealt with the export-promotion effect. When, after 1970, Poland launched an extensive technology importing programme, it was assumed that this would prove an essential stimulus which would in the long run change Poland's position in the international division of labour; in the short term, export growth would constitute the main source of foreign exchange needed to repay <b>credits</b> <b>drawn</b> for technology imports...|$|R
