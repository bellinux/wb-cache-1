Numerous parallel ridges are resolved in the southern and eastern extensions of the feature, though some ridges appear <b>chevron</b> <b>shaped.</b> Just as Kargel and Pozio (1996) found parts of this feature lying within topographic lows, sharp scarps bound the ridge belts in several regions. On the far eastern tip of Samarkand Sulci, these scarps begin to converge as the ridge belts disappear, forming narrow canyons. Northern Samarkand Sulci was also observed. This region appears unconsolidated with several craters, like Ahmad and Peri-Banu, appearing to be cross-cut or even flooded by this portion of Samarkand Sulci.|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} foil {{thrust bearing}} is described that eliminates or reduces {{the need for}} forced cooling of the bearing foils {{while at the same}} time improves the load capacity of the bearing, enhances damping, provides overload tolerance, and eliminates the high speed load capacity drop-off that plagues the current state of the art. The performance improvement demonstrated by the chevron foil thrust bearing stems from a novel trailing edge shape that splays the hot lubricant in the thin film radially, thus preventing hot lubricant carry-over into the ensuing bearing sector. Additionally, the <b>chevron</b> <b>shaped</b> trailing edge induces vortical mixing of the hot lubricant with the gas that is naturally resident within the inter-pad region of a foil thrust bearing. The elimination of hot gas carry-over in combination with the enhanced mixing has enabled a completely passive thermally managed foil bearing design. Laboratory testing at NASA has confirmed the original analysis and reduced this concept to practice...|$|R
40|$|M-type barium hexaferrite {{films have}} been grown by liquid phase epitaxy and {{examined}} by x-ray diffraction,scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and conventional and Lorentz-mode transmission electron microscopy(TEM). These films exhibit a diamond <b>chevron</b> <b>shaped</b> “brick wall” microstructure with c-axis oriented hexaferrite platelets.

40|$|The body {{segments}} of fish have a folded <b>shape,</b> called <b>chevron,</b> which is {{obvious from the}} oblique orientation of fish bones. The <b>chevron</b> <b>shape</b> has been proposed to be optimal for the alternating body movements during swimming. Much less is known about which physical mechanisms underly {{the development of this}} shape during embryogenesis. In this thesis we will review which mechanisms have been proposed in the literature and show that they are insufficient. Based on our data analysis of segment shape changes, we propose a novel mechanism to explain the beginning chevron development. A mathematical model of the interactions between developing muscle fibers and segment boundaries is derived and solved analytically and numerically. Model predictions are verified for early chevron formation by comparison to experimental data. We discuss possible extensions of our model to account for additional properties of later stages in chevron formation. Furthermore we propose experiments that could validate our “Muscle Pioneer Hypothesis” and state open questions concerning chevron pattern development that could not be discussed in this thesis...|$|R

The {{smoke grenade}} launchers were moved {{from either side}} of the main armament back to the {{either side of the}} turret and positioned between the turret side and the ERA panels. On the turret of the T-80BV, the panels are joined to form a shallow <b>chevron</b> <b>shape.</b> ERA is also fitted to the forward part of the turret roof to provide protection against attacks from above. While the ERA provides a high degree of protection against ATGM of its time which relied on a HEAT warhead to penetrate armor over the frontal arc. It does not provide any added protection against APDS or APFSDS. Vehicles which were built first for sometime lacked the ERA because of supply problems. Some T-80BV tanks have been equipped with dust flap under glacis plate and some of them were equipped with single line of ERA along top of hull side. A late production version had a new turret similar to the T-80U but with Kontakt-1 ERA.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The present {{environmental}} issues have made aircraft jet noise reduction a crucial problem in aero-acoustics research. Acoustic studies reveal that addition of chevrons to the nozzle reduces the {{sound pressure level}} reasonably with acceptable reduction in performance. In this paper comprehensive numerical studies on acoustic characteristics {{of different types of}} chevron nozzles have been carried out with non-reacting flows for the <b>shape</b> optimization of <b>chevrons</b> in supersonic nozzles for aerospace applications. The numerical studies have been carried out using a validated steady 3 D density based, k-ε turbulence model. In this paper chevron with sharp edge, flat edge, round edge and U-type edge are selected for the jet acoustic characterization of supersonic nozzles. We observed that compared to the base model a case with round-shaped chevron nozzle could reduce 4. 13 % acoustic level with 0. 6 % thrust loss. We concluded that the prudent selection of the <b>chevron</b> <b>shape</b> will enable an appreciable reduction of the aircraft jet noise without compromising its overall performance. It is evident from the present numerical simulations that k-ε model can predict reasonably well the acoustic level of chevron supersonic nozzles for its shape optimization...|$|R

50|$|The body is {{moderately}} elongate {{and slightly}} compressed. The dorsal profile is gently curved from the snout {{to the base}} of the forward dorsal spines, with a slight hump above the back edge of the preopercle. The snout is moderately sharp, and the mouth narrow in front, but wide at the gill openings. The cleft of the mouth is oblique with fairly thick lips. The jaws are sub-equal. There is a broad band of teeth in each jaw, with the outer row enlarged, and a curved or <b>chevron</b> <b>shaped</b> band on the vomer. Prominent tentacles above the eyes consist of flattish stalks dividing into several short simple branches at the tips. The cirri on the front nostrils are long, narrow and pointed. The dorsal fin is low, the first three spines are not elevated to form a crest, but are widely spaced. There is a notch in the fin membrane between the third and fourth spines, varying in depth, but rarely absent. The remaining spines gradually increase in length. There are clusters of 3-4 cirri at tips of the dorsal spines for about half the length of the fin. The inner pelvic ray is very small when present, but usually absent. The caudal peduncle is short.|$|R
5000|$|Concavodontinae is {{composed}} of three described genera {{and a total of}} five described species. The type genus Concavodonta {{is composed}} of three species found in Bavaria, France, and Argentina. The second genus, Emiliodonta, and third genus Hemiconcavodonta are both monotypic, and known only from the Argentine precordillera. Concavodonta is a small bivalve which was first described in 1972 by Claude Babin and Michel Melou. [...] The structuring of the shell in Concavodonta has been noted to be anomalous. While several specimens from other taxa, such as Praeleda costae and Ctenodonta have been found with occasional concavodont teeth, they are not typical. All genera in Concavodontinae are identified by the hinge displaying <b>chevron</b> <b>shaped</b> teeth where the concavity in the chevron faces the center of the hinge and the umbo. In both Concavodonta and Emiliodonta both the anterior and posterior rows of teeth in the shell face outwards away from the umbo. In Hemiconcavodonta only the posterior teeth are concavodont, while the anterior teeth are convexodont and thus facing away from the hinges center. Concavodontinae differs from the second subfamily in Praenuculidae, Praenuculinae, whose members are identified by tooth chevrons with concavities facing the outer edges of the shell and chevron points facing the umbo.|$|R
