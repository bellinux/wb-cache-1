50|$|Mr. Holt {{stands alone}} in his contentions. I think he must have mistaken the tree, because his memory would be almost superhuman if he ever saw the {{pointing}} branch of that tree stand upright. We have not acted without <b>consulting</b> <b>authorities.</b> Frank R. Grover, {{vice president of the}} Evanston Historical Society, read a paper on Indian trail marks before the Chicago Historical Society on Feb. 21, 1905. His paper can be found on pages 267-8 of the publication of that society. He said that at various points along the north shore, following the old Indian trails, trees were still to be found which had evidently been bent and tied down with saplings to mark the Indian trails. The trees, he said, were invariably large, which indicated that they had been bent something over a century ago. One of the trees he mentioned was selected by the committee to support the tablet.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2013 General Elections, the IEBC {{declared}} that Raila Odinga had lost to Uhuru Kenyatta. Raila Odinga {{refused to accept}} defeat. In a press conference shortly after the results were announced noted that the election had been marred by massive failures by the BVR kits, EVID (electronic voter identification or [...] "Pollbooks"), RTS (results transmission system or [...] "tallying system") and the RPS (results presentation or [...] "transmissions system"). He claimed that the manual tallying was suspect leaving him {{no choice but to}} The Kenya Presidential Election Petition 2013 contest the result in Kenya's highest court, The Supreme Court. Mindful of bringing the challenge, Raila Odinga and his lawyers George Oraro, Mutula Kilonzo, and James Orengo, secretly instructed Raj Pal Senna, a Management Consultant from Barcelona to carry out a forensic investigation of the technology used in the Kenyan General Election 2013, during which the IEBC made claims on TV and media that there were [...] "technological challenges", that [...] "servers overloaded" [...] and that [...] "database crashed". Raj Pal Senna included in this work a forensic examination of the evidence of IEBC and Uhuru Kenyatta in relation to the technology deployed during the Kenyan Presidential Elections. Raila Odinga and his lawyers then took appropriate legal steps to verify the findings of Raj Pal Senna by <b>consulting</b> <b>authorities</b> in the USA and the UK. The findings of the Raj Pal Senna were then documented in his witness statement for Raila Odinga, and became to be known as [...] "Witness Statement RO6" ...|$|E

60|$|In {{that four}} months he had <b>consulted</b> <b>authorities,</b> {{examined}} records, visited the Heralds' College, written letters, {{and made a}} few friends. A rich American, tracing his genealogical tree, was not a new thing--even in that day--in London; {{but there was something}} original and simple in his methods, and so much that was grave, reserved, and un-American in his personality, that it awakened interest. A recognition that he was a foreigner, but a puzzled doubt, however, of his exact nationality, which he found everywhere, at first pained him, but he became reconciled to it {{at about the same time}} that his English acquaintances abandoned their own reserve and caution before the greater reticence of this melancholy American, and actually became the questioners! In this way his quest became known only as a disclosure of his own courtesy, and offers of assistance were pressed eagerly upon him. That was why Sir Edward Atherly found himself gravely puzzled, as he sat with his family solicitor one morning in the library of Ashley Grange.|$|R

60|$|Not so {{much can}} be said for Annals of the Life of Shakespeare, which is a dull though well-meaning little book. What we do not know about Shakespeare is a most {{fascinating}} subject, and one that would fill a volume, but what we do know about him is so meagre and inadequate that when it is collected together the result is rather depressing. However, there are many people, no doubt, who find a great source of interest in the fact that he author of The Merchant of Venice once brought an action for the sum of 1 pound, 15s. 10d. and gained his suit, and for these this volume will have considerable charm. It is a pity that the finest line Ben Jonson ever wrote about Shakespeare should be misquoted {{at the very beginning of}} the book, and the illustration of Shakespeare's monument gives the inscription very badly indeed. Also, it was Ben Jonson's stepfather, not his 'father-in-law,' as stated, who was the bricklayer; but it is quite useless to dwell upon these things, as nobody nowadays seems to have any time either to correct proofs or to <b>consult</b> <b>authorities.</b>|$|R

60|$|All {{the poor}} lad wanted {{was time to}} think, time to examine, time to <b>consult</b> <b>authorities,</b> living and dead. The Catholics called this treason to the Church, the Huguenots called it halting between two opinions; and between them he was a proscribed, distrusted vagabond, branded on one side as a recreant, {{and on the other}} as a traitor. He had asked for a few months of quiet, and where could they be had? His grand-mother had been the {{daughter}} of a Scottish nobleman in the French service, and he had once seen a nephew of hers who had come to Paris during the time of Queen Mary's residence there. He imagined that if he were once out of this distracted land of France, he might find respite for study, for which he longed; and utterly ignorant of the real state of Scotland, he had determined to make his way to his kindred there; and he had struggled on the way to La Rochelle, cheated out of the small remains of his money, selling his last jewels and all the clothing that was not indispensable, and becoming so utterly unable to pay his passage to England, that he could only trust to Providence to find him some means of reaching his present goal.|$|R
