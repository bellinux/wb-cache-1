2500|$|Of his music, {{only six}} {{examples}} survive, including five chansons and a {{setting of the}} mass. [...] The mass, Missa quarti toni, is for four voices. [...] The chansons, probably written in the 1470s, all use the formes fixes; all are in French, and all are for three voices.

2500|$|Today's Colombian tiple is {{the result}} of a lengthy {{modification}} of guitars brought by the conquistadors to the New World. Historically it is difficult to say precisely what a tiple is since a number of chordophones have adopted such names over the centuries. There exists also the discrepancies in names given to the same instrument in different parts of Colombia.

2500|$|... "Ô Canada! mon pays, mes amours" [...] is a French-Canadian song, {{written by}} George-Étienne Cartier first sung in 1834, during a {{patriotic}} banquet of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society held in Montreal. The words were {{first published in}} the June 29, 1835, edition of La Minerve and its music in Le <b>Chansonnier</b> des collèges in 1850; it is uncertain when the lyrics and music were put together, probably by Ernest Gagnon sometime between 1850 and 1868.

2500|$|The most eminent folk {{performers}} {{from the}} county are the Watersons from Hull, who began recording Yorkshire versions of folk songs from 1965, and members of which are still performing today. Also famous is the Leeds-born musician Jake Thackray, who became famous in the 1970s for singing witty, often bawdy songs, many of which related to rural Yorkshire life, in a style derived from the French <b>chansonnier</b> tradition. His work led him to be described by some as the [...] "Northern Noel Coward". Other Yorkshire folk musicians include Heather Wood (b. 1945) of the Young Tradition, the short-lived electric folk group Mr Fox (1970–2), The Deighton Family, Julie Matthews, Kathryn Roberts, and the Mercury Prize nominated Kate Rusby.|$|E
2500|$|Fedé wrote both {{sacred and}} secular music, {{but only a}} few pieces have survived of what may have been a {{substantial}} output, based on his reputation, and his appearance {{as one of the great}} composers of the age in Eloy's massive 1508 poem, which listed the composers resident in Heaven. [...] Several two-voice settings of the Magnificat by Fedé survive in manuscripts preserved at Ferrara. [...] Some of his secular pieces, a rondeau and two virelai, survive in a <b>chansonnier</b> from Nivelles, but were not recovered until the development of ultraviolet document-recovery technology in 1984, for most of them had been carefully erased. [...] The apparent deliberate eradication of only Fedé's music from this collection suggests that the original owner of the book either did not care for the composer or the music.|$|E
2500|$|The album also {{features}} the single [...] "Primavera in anticipo (It Is My Song)" [...] / Primavera anticipada (It Is My Song)", {{a duet with}} British singer-songwriter James Blunt.

Pausini grew up listening to Aznavour's songs, and in a January 2009 interview on France 2's Vivement Dimanche hosted by Michel Drucker, Aznavour said of Pausini, seated by his side after a live duet performance of [...] "Paris au mois d'août," [...] that [...] "she knows the lyrics [...] better than me." [...] In November 2009 Primavera in anticipo went on to win Best Female Album at the Latin Grammy Awards. In 2010 Pausini also won the Lo Nuestro Award for Female Artist of the Year.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>chansonnier</b> (female: chansonnière) [...] was a poet songwriter, solitary singer, {{who sang}} {{his or her}} own songs (chansons) with a guitar in Quebec, Canada, during the 1960s and 1970s.
