The {{fatigue test}} of a {{full-scale}} aircraft body aims to understand the initiation and development of fatigue damage and fatigue crack of its critical structures, and hence to determine fatigue life, maintenance and repairing cycles. The work of non-destructive testing and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring during the whole fatigue test {{plays a key role}} in guaranteeing the success of the test and achieving the prescribed goal. The controlling test of landing gears is part of this fatigue test. The main structures under considerations are uplocks and lower locks of main landing gears, uplock of nose landing gear, and actuator <b>cylinder</b> <b>flanges</b> of both gears. By using the combination of trend analysis and correlation analysis of AE parameters, real time monitoring of landing gear condition is realized, and the leak in the actuator and the linkage wearing were successfully predicted. The methods used are straightforward and direct, they can supply fast analysis speed and realize real time monitoring. The work provides a useful reference for AE signal processing in the future fatigue test or for AE monitoring technique used in the same environment of high background noise...|$|R

The largest extending <b>cylinder</b> included a <b>flange</b> halfway along its length, against which hydraulic pressure could be selectively applied from either above or below; {{it was used}} during raising to delay its extension until all other cylinders had extended, and also to begin the lowering process when the lifting frame was vertical (once lowering had thus been initiated, gravity finished the job).|$|R

The original Thomas cannula consisted of a hard rubber luminal flange, a hard rubber threaded internal cylinder, a threaded external <b>cylinder</b> and <b>flange</b> of aluminum alloy, and a threaded hard rubber stopper. Thomas suggested a special set of wrenches for installation and adjustment of the cannula.

40|$|Controlling {{cylinder}} nozzle resonant pulsations {{while maintaining}} acceptable compressor performance {{has been an}} issue in reciprocating compressors for the last 50 years or more. The common solution to reduce vibrations and pulsations in the cylinder nozzle is the installation of an orifice plate at the compressor <b>cylinder</b> nozzle <b>flange</b> or welded into the nozzle near the nozzle-to-bottle acoustic junction. Lower efficiencies and higher pulsations are more evident for high speed, high horsepower machines due in-part to the higher mean flows and coincidence of the cylinder nozzle acoustic response with lower compressor orders. The GMRC pulsation research program at Southwest Research Institute has developed a pulsation control device as a replacement and improvement upon the commonly installed cylinder nozzle orifice plate solution. The new device is termed the Virtual Orifice. The Virtual Orifice (VO) has recently been installed at El Paso’s Baxter compressor station. Measured field data {{has shown that the}} installation of the VO resulted in a significant reduction in pulsations and vibrations related to the cylinder nozzle resonance while noticeably improving the compressor efficiency. This paper will discuss the fundamental issues that the Virtual Orifice is designed to address. I...|$|R
40|$|A spill-resistant vessel {{has been}} {{developed}} for dispensing an alkali-metal vapor. Vapors of alkali metals (most commonly, cesium or rubidium, both of which melt at temperatures slightly above room temperature) are needed for atomic frequency standards, experiments in spectroscopy, and experiments in laser cooling. Although the present spill-resistant alkali-metal dispenser was originally intended {{for use in the}} low-gravity environment of outer space, it can also be used in normal Earth gravitation: indeed, its utility as a vapor source was confirmed by use of cesium in a ground apparatus. The vessel is made of copper. It consists of an assembly of <b>cylinders</b> and <b>flanges,</b> shown in the figure. The uppermost cylinder is a fill tube. Initially, the vessel is evacuated, the alkali metal charge is distilled {{into the bottom of the}} vessel, and then the fill tube is pinched closed to form a vacuum seal. The innermost cylinder serves as the outlet for the vapor, yet prevents spilling by protruding above the surface of the alkali metal, no matter which way or how far the vessel is tilted. In the event (unlikely in normal Earth gravitation) that any drops of molten alkali metal have been shaken loose by vibration and are floating freely, a mesh cap on top of the inner cylinder prevents the drops from drifting out with the vapor. Liquid containment of the equivalent of 1. 2 grams of cesium was confirmed for all orientations with rubbing alcohol in one of the prototypes later used with cesium...|$|R

The collet retainer tube fillet weld was performed in 1983 and subsequently assembled into a Group 003 part number 919 D 258 G 003 CTF. This G 003 CTF assembly was assembled into a CRD in 1995 and placed into service in 1996. GEH continues to investigate the cause(s) of the failed fillet weld. Once the cause of the fillet weld failure is determined, GEH will review the extent of condition of this failure as well as the consequences to determine if a reportable condition exists. "There were no adverse effects on the CRD's operation observed due to this failure.

40|$|The fluid bubble {{eliminator}} (FBE) is {{a device}} that removes gas bubbles from a flowing liquid. The FBE contains no moving parts and does not require any power input beyond that needed to pump the liquid. In the FBE, the buoyant force for separating the gas from the liquid is provided by a radial pressure gradient associated with a centrifugal flow of the liquid and any entrained bubbles. A device based on a similar principle is described in Centrifugal Adsorption Cartridge System (MSC- 22863), which appears on page 48 of this issue. The FBE was originally intended for use in filtering bubbles out of a liquid flowing relatively slowly in a bioreactor system in microgravity. Versions that operate in normal Earth gravitation at greater flow speeds may also be feasible. The FBE (see figure) is constructed as a cartridge that includes two concentric <b>cylinders</b> with <b>flanges</b> at the ends. The outer cylinder is an impermeable housing; the inner cylinder comprises a gas-permeable, liquid-impermeable membrane covering a perforated inner tube. Multiple spiral disks that collectively constitute a spiral ramp are mounted {{in the space between}} the inner and outer cylinders. The liquid enters the FBE through an end flange, flows in the annular space between the cylinders, and leaves through the opposite end flange. The spiral disks channel the liquid into a spiral flow, the circumferential component of which gives rise to the desired centrifugal effect. The resulting radial pressure gradient forces the bubbles radially inward; that is, toward the inner cylinder. At the inner cylinder, the gas-permeable, liquid-impermeable membrane allows the bubbles to enter the perforated inner tube while keeping the liquid in the space between the inner and outer cylinders. The gas thus collected can be vented via an endflange connection to the inner tube. The centripetal acceleration (and thus the radial pressure gradient) is approximately proportional to the square of the flow speed and approximately inversely proportional to an effective radius of the annular space. For a given FBE geometry, one could increase the maximum rate at which gas could be removed by increasing the rate of flow to obtain more centripetal acceleration. In experiments and calculations oriented toward the original microgravitational application, centripetal accelerations between 0. 001 and 0. 012 g [where g normal Earth gravitation (. 9. 8 m/s 2) ] were considered. For operation in normal Earth gravitation, it would likely be necessary to choose the FBE geometry and the rate of flow to obtain centripetal acceleration comparable to or greater than g...|$|R
