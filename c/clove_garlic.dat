40|$|ABSTRACT: Introduction & Objective: Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{a common}} disease in human societies. Proteins non-enzymatic glycation has deleterious effects on the structure and function of proteins. Non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins can {{be involved in the}} pathogenesis of diabetic complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy. One way of preventing this reaction is the use of medicinal plants. Chamomile, <b>clove</b> and <b>garlic</b> are herbs which their alkaloid compounds have antioxidant property. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of chamomile, <b>clove</b> and <b>garlic</b> extract on non-enzymatic glycosylation of albumin. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study, hydroalcoholic extract of chamomile, <b>clove</b> and <b>garlic</b> was prepared. In vitro albumin glycosylation reaction was carried out in presence of different concentrations (0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 1 g/L) of chamomile, <b>clove</b> and <b>garlic</b> extracts and level of glycosylated albumin was measured. Non-enzymatic glycosylation of albumin was determined by nitrobluetetrazuliom method. Absorbance changes were measured in 530 nm by Eppendorf spectrophotometer. Results: In this study, chamomile extract in 0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 1 g/L of its concentrations had respectively 9 %, 17 % and 26 %, inhibitory effect on albumin glycosylation. Albumin glycosylation reaction was inhibited 23 % by 0. 01 g/L concentration of <b>clove</b> and <b>garlic</b> extracts and the level of inhibition of albumin glycosylation decreased by increasing of extracts concentration. Chamomile extract with 0. 1 g/L concentration has the most effect among the studied extracts. Conclusion: In this study, chamomile extract inhibited the in vitro albumin glycosylation reaction. <b>Clove</b> and <b>garlic</b> extracts showed inhibitory effect in low concentration but this effect decreased with increasing of the extract concentration...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Although {{the potato}} (Solanum tuberosum L.) {{is a global}} crop, few growing regions rival the high yields of the Columbia Basin of Eastern Oregon and Washington. Two {{research}} projects were conducted in Hermiston, OR to contribute to best management practices for the region. The first project evaluated the efficacy of essential oils to manage Verticillium dahliae Kleb., a persistent soilborne pathogen of potato that when untreated leads to significant yield loss. The objectives of this research were to: 1) evaluate if essential oils inhibit V. dahliae growth in vitro; 2) evaluate whether essential oils adversely impacted plant growth; and 3) determine whether an integrated management approach using essential oils and selective fertilizer application could be an effective approach in mitigating crop loss from V. dahliae in vivo. Twelve treatments including carvacrol (an extract of Origanum vulgare), clove (Eugenia spp.), lemongrass (Cymbopogon spp.), and garlic (Allium sativum) were evaluated by transferring from an actively growing V. dahliae VCG 4 A colony on Sorensen's NP- 10 media to similar media amended with varying concentrations of essential oils.

40|$|Eight {{strains of}} yeasts (Candida lipolytica, Debaryomyces hansenii, Hansenula anomala, Kloeckera apiculata, Lodderomyces elongisporus, Rhodotorula rubra, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Torulopsis glabrata) were {{examined}} {{for changes in}} sensitivity to eight essential oils of plants (allspice, cinnamon, <b>clove,</b> <b>garlic,</b> onion, oregano, savory, and thyme) after being sublethally heat stressed. With the exception of garlic oil for all test yeasts, onion oil for S. cerevisiae, and oregano oil for R. rubra, the essential oils at concentrations of up to 200 ppm in recovery media did not interfere with colony formation by unheated cells. However, some oils, at concentrations as low as 25 ppm in recovery media, reduced populations of sublethally heat-stressed cells compared to populations recovered in media containing no test oils. This demonstrates that the yeasts were either metabolically or structurally damaged {{as a result of}} being exposed to elevated temperatures and that essential oils prohibited repair of injury. The size (diameter) of colonies produced on oil-supplemented recovery agar by heat-stressed cells was reduced compared to that observed on unsupplemented agar. Pigment production by heated R. rubra was inhibited by oils of oregano, savory, and thyme, but enhanced by garlic and onion oils. The influence of essential oils on survival of yeasts in thermally processed foods and in the enumeration of stressed cells in these foods should not be minimized...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Many of {{the spices}} used daily have been {{documented}} to be antimicrobial and have medicinal value as well. Most bacteria {{are sensitive to the}} extracts from plants such as <b>clove,</b> <b>garlic,</b> mustard, onion, oregano, turmeric etc. spices such as garlic turmeric and cinnamon has been used as antimicrobial agents in their raw form for the treatment of wounds and injuries and joint pains etc. The present study was conducted to investigate the antibacterial activity of garlic, cinnamon and turmeric. Different concentrations of extracts were prepared by using two solvents water and ethanol. The antibacterial activity was tested against Bacillus subtilus (DSM 3256) and E. coli (ATCC 25922) at different concentration of extracts of spices by using disc diffusion method. According to the results among the selected spices garlic had the best inhibitory activity showing maximum zone of 26 mm against Bacillus subtilis DSM and a zone of 22 mm against E. coli ATCC 25922. The aqueous extracts of garlic were more effective than ethanolic extract. In the case of cinnamon and turmeric, the ethanolic extracts were more effective exhibiting zones of 16 mm against B. subtilis DSM 3256 and 17 mm against E. coli, which showed that the cinnamon ethanolic extracts are equally effective against both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. The widest zones formed by ethanolic extract of turmeric against B. subtilis was measured as 14 mm and it was 11 mm for E. coli ATCC 25922.

40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science - Animal Sciences & IndustryFadi AramouniBlue-green {{pigments}} {{have the}} ability to form in crushed and whole <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> following a rapid series of enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. Economic losses associated with a reduction in organoleptic quality of garlic (Allium sativum L.) containing blue-green pigments can be incurred. Preventing blue-green pigment formation can mitigate potential financial and brand equity damages. To prevent pigment formation, inactivation of the enzyme which yields pigment substrates is essential. Two methods to inactivate the enzyme associated with pigment formation were explored: blanch treatment of whole <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> (100 °C, 5 min); and soaking of whole, non-blanched <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> in low pH (< 3. 0) acetic or citric acid pickling solutions for seven days. The blanching treatment was effective in inactivating the enzyme as the pigment substrate decreased by approximately 99 % as compared with pigment substrate concentrations in non-blanched <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves.</b> Soaking whole <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> in low pH (< 3. 0) pickling solutions did not result in enzyme inactivation as pigments formed in cloves soaked in the acetic acid pickling solutions; however pigments did not form in cloves soaked in the citric acid pickling solution.

Blanching <b>garlic</b> <b>cloves</b> can be implemented as a processing step to prevent pigment formation.

Five bacterial species, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus leteus, Micrococcus rosues, Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis were predominant isolates. Two fungal species, namely, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Rhizopus stolonifer were also isolated. Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae remained the predominant organisms throughout the storage.

The microbial population increased for two days as the organisms utilize the nutrients present in the sample. There was a drastic reduction in microbial load as the effects of the preservative became evident, except for the control sample. Antimicrobial activities of the preservatives revealed that samples with chemical preservatives were most effective against bacteria and fungi species, followed by the natural plant extracts samples. Pasteurization confers temporary preservation as its effect was short lived. The phytochemical and antimicrobial activities of the plants used had been reported. Of all the samples, only those treated with chemical preservatives remained organoleptically attractive after preservation for 14 days. The overall reduction in the microbial population could be a concerted effort of the preservatives and exhaustion of nutrients in the zobo drink.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade {{there has been an}} {{explosion}} in the probiotic industry due to an increase in concern for health. It is well known that these probiotic products offer consumers numerous health benefits and that viability of cultures in these products need to be maintained at high levels. It is therefore important to test for antimicrobial compounds or substances that may come into contact with probiotics and thereby negatively affect and decrease their viability. Garlic (Allium sativum) {{has been used as a}} natural medicinal remedy for thousands of years and research has shown that it has antimicrobial activity against a wide variety of microorganisms. Although it has been tested against numerous pathogenic microorganisms, there have been few studies on its effect on beneficial bacteria, specifically probiotic Bifidobacterium species. A great amount of work and money is put into preparing probiotic products with sufficient numbers of viable bacterial cells. All these are devoted to ensure that the consumers seize the optimal purported health benefits from probiotic cultures incorporated within the different products. Hence it is necessary to recognize any compound or substance that poses a threat to viability of these probiotic cells, thereby rendering them ineffective. Therefore, the current study aimed at determining whether garlic had any antibacterial activity towards selected Bifidobacterium spp. In vitro studies revealed that garlic has an inhibitory effect on these specific probiotic bacteria. The disk diffusion assay revealed antibacterial activity of garlic preparations characterized by inhibition zones ranging from 13. 0 ± 1. 7 to 36. 7 ± 1. 2 mm. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for garlic clove extract ranged from 75. 9 to 303. 5 mg/ml (estimated to contain 24. 84 to 99. 37 μg/ml allicin) while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranged from 10. 24 to 198. 74 μg/ml xix allicin. Susceptibility of the tested Bifidobacterium species to garlic varied between species as well as between strains even within a small numbers of the tested bifidobacteria. Among the tested Bifidobacterium spp., B. bifidum LMG 11041 was most susceptible to garlic, whereas B. lactis Bi- 07 300 B was the most resistant. These results were contrary to what has been generally published in literature, that garlic selectively kills pathogens without negatively affecting beneficial bacteria. Garlic <b>clove,</b> <b>garlic</b> powder, garlic paste and garlic spice showed varying degrees of potency, with fresh garlic clove extract and garlic paste extract having the highest and lowest antibifidobacterial activity, respectively. It became necessary to investigate the actual antibacterial mechanism of action of garlic on Bifidobacterium spp., upon realization that its extracts inhibits growth of or kills some of these bacteria, whose contribution to health and well being of consumers is to a large extent dependent on their viability. This was determined by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the effect of garlic on the morphology and cell surface properties of the tested strains while FT-IR spectroscopy was used to determine any biochemical changes taking place in garlic-treated bifidobacteria. Scanning electron microscopy showed various morphological changes such as cell elongation, distorted cells with bulbous ends and cocci-shaped cells. Behavioural changes were also observed such as swarming of cells was also observed. FT-IR spectra confirmed that garlic damaged Bifidobacterium cells by inducing biochemical changes within the cells. It identified some of the main targets sites of garlic on bifidobacteria, mainly, the nucleic acids and fatty acids (lipids) in the cell membrane. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the level at which the garlic decreased the viability of Bifidobacterium cells as well as the extent of damage induced by the garlic. Results revealed a drop in viability with associated decrease in stainability of some the cells, for all strains upon treatment with garlic clove extract. The inability of cells to be stained by nucleic acid stains, hence presence of cells referred to as ‘ghost cells’, has been associated with extensive damage and lysis of cellular membranes resulting in loss nucleic acids. Interestingly, re-inoculation of the cells analysed by flow cytometry into a fresh growth medium and their subsequent reanalysis using the same technique showed an increase in percentage of viable cells and a decrease in percentages of damaged, unstained and dead cells. This suggested that injured cells were able to recover and regress to their active state. Therefore, Bifidobacterium cells exposed to sub lethal amounts of garlic can repair any damage and regrow. However, it was not determined how long active compounds of garlic remain stable within the gastrointestinal tract. This study is the first, according to our knowledge, to show that garlic exhibits antibacterial activity against beneficial bacteria specifically, probiotic bifidobacteria. Furthermore, the results revealed that the mechanism of action of garlic towards bifidobacteria is similar to that which was reported for pathogenic bacteria. Bacterial death and growth inhibition occurs due to damage to the fatty acids/lipids in the cell membrane, modification of the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). This study is of significant importance to consumers, medical practitioners as well as to the probiotic industry. It suggests that if garlic comes into contact with probiotic bifidobacteria, they die and thus become unable to deliver the promised health benefits to the consumers. Therefore, consumers should be advised against ingestion of probiotic products and garlic simultaneously, as this study reveals that garlic does indeed inhibit some probiotic Bifidobacterium spp. The probiotic industry should also consider including this information on their product labels to make consumers aware of this fact. Failure to include this information may lead to market deterioration due to loss of interest in the products as soon as consumers realize they do not get their money’s worth from the products. Lastly, medical practitioners should also be made aware of this as they also prescribe probiotics to patients for various health reasons. The effect of food matrices on the antibacterial effects, as well as determination of how long the active compounds of garlic remain within the gastrointestinal tract, in relation to levels of garlic ingested will confirm whether indeed there is concern. But for now, in light of results of the current study, caution needs to be taken in simultaneous use of probiotics and garlic, until further testing indicates otherwise.
