The act of sexual union resembles the nature of the 7th house from the sign rising at the time of union or query; if evil planets occupy or aspect the 7th, then the act will be conducted in a quarrelling mood, but when benefics aspect or join the 7th the union takes place under very pleasant circumstances.|$|E
