40|$|Abstract: Localization {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the key technologies of WSN (wireless sensor networks), and there are two kinds of WSN localization algorithm, distance-based and distance-free algorithms. APIT (approximate point in time) is a distance-free algorithm which is not depends on hardware and has a relative low localization error rate. But there are two obviously shortages of APIT, firstly, the average <b>cover</b> <b>rate</b> is not 100 %, and it will decrease with the communication radius dramatically; secondly, the average <b>cover</b> <b>rate</b> will be lower and the localization error rate will be higher when there are obstacles in distribution environment.

APIT (approximate point in time) is one of the efficient poisoning algorithm in WSN, the advantage of APIT is the localization error rate is lower than other distance-free algorithms, so, we select APIT as the poisoning algorithm in core poisoning system, but according to the special application, there are some disadvantage of APIT algorithm, firstly, the <b>cover</b> <b>rate</b> can’t reach 100 %; secondly, the core well is a C-shape like distribution instead of a regular rectangle distribution.

30|$|The {{development}} of local industry {{has the potential}} to absorb a large number of transferred agricultural labors, and also to create the conditions to reduce agricultural nonpoint source pollution. The industrial {{development of}} the Xixia County has absorbed a lot of agricultural population originally living on mountain forest resources and land resources. The transferred agricultural population, on one hand, will no longer engage in agricultural production, resulting in a reduction of agricultural nonpoint source pollution and deforestation. On the other hand, farmers will be able to consume cleaner energy due to relatively high income from the industrial sector. By contrast, neighboring Xichuan County has basically the same natural conditions as those of the Xixia County, but a significantly lower forest <b>cover</b> <b>rate.</b> One important reason is that its industrial sector is underdeveloped so that it is difficult for the county's industry to absorb a large number of rural labors and thereby reduce dependency on and damage to mountain forest resources.|$|E

40|$|The {{erosion of}} {{biodiversity}} {{is caused by}} many factors. Large ungulates, which occupy {{a large part of}} the Walloon forests, can also influence the distribution and dynamics of plant species. Therefore, they impact the biodiversity of our temperate forests. The aim of the present study is to identify changes in forest understory vegetation due to the pressure exerted by wild ungulates thanks to an exclosure-enclosure experiment. This study was conducted on a high plateau of the Ardenne, in the forest of St Michel Freyr (South Belgium). The forested area is dominated by beech and spruce where red deer, wild boar and roe deer are living in sympatry. 150 sampling plots were established in 2000. Each plot consisted of two closed enclosures of 4 m² each and one exclosure of 4 m² as control under pressure of ungulates. Sampling was carried out systematically by a 500 m-square mesh. The <b>cover</b> <b>rate</b> and height of some easily identifiable species were measured regularly since 2000 (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2011 - 2012). In addition, we identified each herbaceous species in 2011 - 2012 to analyze the species richness after more than 10 years exclosure. Ligneous species showed an increase of developpement in the fenced area. These species are more impacted when they are not much represented in the study site. Species richness and diversity are higher in areas impacted by herbivory. Monocotyledons are mainly favorised while tree seedlings are unfavorised. Browsing on the trees keeps the area free from high vegetation and allows light to reach the ground. In the same time, herbaceous species have a lower <b>cover</b> <b>rate</b> in the enclosure because of the competitive exclusion induced by shrub and tree seedlings layer. If the apparition of most species is favorised by ungulates, they induce a lag of gowth on dicotyledons which have a higher palatability than monocotyledons. Ungulates have the ability to impact the distribution of vegetal species by the modification of the competitive interaction. By their pressure on tree and shrub species, they induce a higher diversity of the ground flora. However, this change in vegetation composition is slow and requires a long-term studie, specially in areas of low biomass productivity like the St-Hubert forest. Peer reviewe...|$|E
