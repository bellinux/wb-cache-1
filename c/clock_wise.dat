Depending on the applications, materials with high, medium or low magnetic anisotropy and their possible manipulation are required. The most dramatic manifestation in this respect is the chance to manipulate {{the magnetic}} anisotropy over the intrinsic preferential direction of the magnetization, which can open up more functionality particularly for device applications. Types of magnetic anisotropies of different nanostructured materials and their manipulation techniques are investigated in this work. Detail experimental methods for the quantitative determination of magnetic anisotropy in nanomodulated Ni 45 Fe 55 thin film are studied. Magnetic field induced in-plane rotations within the nanomodulated Ni 45 Fe 55 continuous films revealed various rotational symmetries of magnetic anisotropy due to dipolar interactions showing a crossover from lower to higher fold of symmetry as a function of modulation geometry. In a second approach, the control of exchange anisotropy at ferromagnetic (FM) – aniferomagnetic (AFM) interface in multifferoic nanocomposite materials, where two different phase/types of materials were simultaneously synthesized, was investigated.

40|$|The harsh {{climate of}} the Gulf puts severe {{constraints}} on coral survival and, therewith, on biodiversity by restricting the number of coral species that can survive in the harsh conditions. Despite this and despite being at the western high-latitude edge of Indo-Pacific reef coral distribution, the Gulf’s coral fauna is surprisingly rich. Within the region, the richest Gulf coral fauna has been recorded from Saudi Arabia, around the islands of Jana and Karan (50 species, Basson et al. 1977). Fadlallah et al. (1993) subsequently recorded 23 and 19 species in specific sample sites on these two islands and suggested that species richness may actually be lower than suggested by Basson et al. (1977). This is also supported by data in Vogt (1996). The UAE presently has the second-richest documented coral fauna, with 34 scleractinian species (Riegl 1999). More comprehensive studies in other areas and the region would likely reveal a quite homogeneous fauna with little diversity gradient across the Gulf proper. The Iranian coral fauna is rich due to water circulation pattern and better environmental conditions in the northern Gulf. Due to counter <b>clock</b> <b>wise</b> pattern of the water circulation in the Gulf, the northern part and the Iranian coastline has lower temperature, lower salinity, better aragonite saturation, besides also greater depth (see Chap. 2).

This has been seen in octocorals (Samimi-Namin and van Ofwegen 2009) and the same trend exist for hard corals (Samimi-Namin, unpublished data).

The Lebanese restraining bend is a 200 km long bend with a left lateral sense of slip located along the Dead Sea fault system (DSFS) between 33. 2 and 34. 6 degrees north latitude. The DSFS is a transform plate boundary fault system accommodating the differential northward movement of Arabian and Sinai plates relative to the Eurasian plate. Within the Lebanese Restraining bend, The DSFS splays into five left-lateral strike-slip faults, forming a positive flower structure. This study combines GPS measurements from Lebanon, where surveys span about 5. 5 years, with sites from the Anti Lebanon Mountains in SW Syria for a more complete view of crustal deformation in the restraining bend. The GPS network includes continuous GPS sites and 27 campaign sites: 14 sites in Lebanon installed in 2002, 8 sites in Lebanon installed in 2005, and 5 sites in southwestern Syria. Preliminary velocities for older campaign sites have uncertainties less than 0. 75 mm/yr, whereas newer sites have around 1. 5 mm/yr uncertainties. The improved spatial coverage and reduced uncertainties allow constructing; 1) elastic fault models that explore strain partitioning between two strike slip faults (Yammouneh and Serghaya faults) and a generalized off-shore thrust fault to accommodate convergence in the restraining bend, and 2) continuum (velocity gradient) models that explore infinitesimal strain and rotation rates. The models suggest a displacement rate of 4. 5 - 5. 5 mm/yr along the Yammouneh fault and a counter <b>clock</b> <b>wise</b> rotation of 0. 5 °- 1. 75 °/MA within the bend.

40|$|The {{projected}} acidification of {{the surface}} ocean due to the rising level of atmospheric CO 2 {{is directly related to}} the shift in the equilibrium status of the carbonate system. In this article, simplified models were developed and used to assess the potential impacts of various acidification scenarios on the equilibrium chemistry of the carbonate system in the semi enclosed Arabian Gulf, taking into account the unique water circulation patterns and the spatial and seasonal variations of temperature and salinity in the Gulf. Located between latitudes of 23. 5 o- 30 o N, the Gulf is a strategic body of water that supplies many of the surrounding oilexporting countries with a source of water for desalination. The Gulf is a semi enclosed sea that is exposed to an arid, sub-tropical climate. With limited freshwater input, high evaporation rate, and extensive disposal of concentrated brines, the circulation of water in the Gulf exhibits a seasonal cyclonic overturning circulation in which the entering surface water from the Indian ocean circulates along the northern coast then turns counter <b>clock</b> <b>wise</b> and downward towards the southern coast to exit the Gulf below the entering surface water as a dense underflow. The resulting spatial and seasonal distributions of salinity and temperature in the Gulf are profound, ranging in the approximate ranges of 36 - 45 ppt and 19 - 33 oC, respectively. The application of the developed models revealed that for a given acidification scenario resulting from a projected increase in the atmospheric CO 2 level, the entering surface water from the Indian Ocean is subject to CO 2 release, pH variations and loss of alkalinity associated with the precipitation of calcium carbonates, consistent with the seasonal and spatial distribution of temperature and salinity in the Gulf. The results suggested that the changing chemistry of the carbonate system in the Gulf can have significant implications in terms of its potential impact on the desalination industry and the biological and biogeochemical processes in the Gulf...|$|E

From three {{moderate}} earthquakes which occurred near the coast line of the Ilan Plain, one of magnitude 6. 2 on 15 May 2002 and the other two of magnitudes 5. 51 and 5. 49 on 5 March 2005, we at tempted to understand the relation ship between the earthquake mechanisms and the geological context. Seven seismic reflection pro files collected roughly parallel to the coast line of the Ilan Plain were used in this work. A structural fault, with a significant normal faulting component trending approximately ENE-WSW, is identified to the east of the doublet earth quakes of 5 March 2005. Be cause this fault follows the ENE-WSW trend of the after shock seismicity, we named it the Ilan Shelf Fault, which might ex tend to the east be yond the Ilan continental shelf spur. How ever, the centroid seismic moment ten sorsolutions for the doublet earth quakes of 5 March 2005 are of a left-lateral strike-slip faulting type which are consistent with onland GPS observations. Hence, the Ilan Shelf Fault may have a left-lateral strike-slip component. Based on GPS data, we suggest that the northern Central Range block, bounded in the west by the Lishan Fault and in the north by the Ilan Shelf Fault, rotates <b>clock</b> <b>wise.</b> This rotation is ascribed to the northwestward collision of the Luzon Arc against Tai wan. Thus, there is a left-lateral strike-slip and an extensional motion along the Ilan Shelf Fault. The northern Central Range block is tilting north ward which may also in duce the normal faulting component of the Ilan Shelf Fault. In short, the Ilan Shelf Fault could be a major tectonic and structural feature bounding {{the southern end of the}} Okinawa Trough backarc basin...|$|E
40|$|The Middle-Late Jurassie mafic dike {{swarms of}} central Chile between 33 °and 33 ° 45 'S registerthe tectonic {{activity}} of the contemporaneous are represented by the Coastal batholith. These dike swarms evidence alternate episodes of transtension and transpression across NW-striking structures, which controlled {{the construction of the}} magmatic are. The Middle-Upper Jurassie and Lower Cretaeeous mafic dike swarms in the Coastal range of central Chile has been studied through field observations, geochronology and AMS (anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility) to document the tectonic and magmatic evolution of the Jurassic-Cretaceous are at this latitude. Middle to Upper Jurassie dike swarms (Concón and Cartagena mafic dike swarms) were emplaced between 163 and 157 Ma, along NW-SE to WNW-ESE-striking host fractures, registering a first stage of magma emplaeement under simstral transtension. During this stage, dikes acquired a fabric characterized by magnetic foliation <b>clock</b> <b>wise</b> oblique to dike trend and gently plunging lineations. This stage was followed rapidly by dike emplaeement under sinistral transpression, with associated steeply plunging lineations in the dikes, reverse shear zones in the country rocks and local oceurrence of horizontal mafic dikes. On the other hand, the Lower Cretaeeous El Tabo dike Swarm was emplaced along tensile fractures that do not register shear displacements along their walls. These dikes were emplaced at shallower crustal levels along tensile fractures. Within each dike swarm, differences in the tectonic style of emplaeement correlates with changes in the geochemical composition of the dikes, suggesting a strong coupling between tectonics and nature of magma supplies in the are. Finally, the current results show that the Mesozoic evolution of the Coastal Batholith of central Chile oceurred in several stages of deformation and not under a simple scenario of extensional tectonics. This magmatism and deformation were strongly controlled by NW- to WNW-striking fractures. These structures are spatially correlated with regional-scale Cenozoic lineaments that are oblique to the orientation of the Andean orogen. We suggest that these lineaments are features inherited at least from Jurassie times...|$|E
