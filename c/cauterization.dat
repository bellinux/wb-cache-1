5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and <b>cauterization</b> may reduce the bleeding from telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} safety and early {{postoperative}} results of ambulatory anorectal surgery using perianal anesthetics infiltration. Material and Method: This retrospective study included 222 elective ambulatory anorectal surgical patients under perianal anesthetics infiltration between March 2002 and September 2005. Perioperative pain, post-operative complications, and surgical outcomes were analyzed. Results: The patients were 122 males and 100 females aged 16 - 84 (mean 43) years undergoing 150 closed hemorrhoidectomies, 55 lateral internal anal sphincterotomies, 28 fistulotomies, and 3 <b>cauterizations</b> for condyloma acuminata. Perianal block was effective, neither intravenous analgesics nor conversion to general anesthesia was needed. The average pain score was 3. 4 + 2. 3 on day 1 and 1. 2 + 1. 5 on day 7 postoperatively. Urinary retention was found in one case (0. 5 %). None of the patients needed hospital admission, except one emergency hospitalization (0. 5 %) due to bleeding. Conclusion: Perianal anesthetics infiltration allows the surgeons to perform anorectal surgery in a day-case regimen safely and effectively with a low incidence of urinary retention...|$|R

40|$|The present {{trend is}} very well aware of mock tests, exams and even the mock {{surgeries}} that are very common in healthcare and {{play an important role}} in providing the surgeons, the necessary practical knowledge and expertise in their specialized field. In addition, patients also get benefited by the mock surgeries by having the complete knowledge before they undergo any surgery. The same concept of mock or the experimental surgeries can be found explained centuries ago by Susrutha, father of both the Ancient and Modern surgery in the Susrutha samhitha under the chapter yogya-sutriya. Hence here, an effort was made to explore the same. Further research studies should be focused on the concept explained by Sushrutha to make it valid and applicable to the present day. The ancient surgical science is known as Salya-tantra. Salya-tantra (surgical science) embraces all processes aiming at the removal of factors responsible for producing pain or misery to the body or mind. Salya(salya-surgical instrument) denotes broken parts of an arrow /other sharp weapons while tantra denotes maneuver. 1 To obtain the complete success in the aimed operating work, practice of similar operations before hand is called yoga and the experiment of such practice is called yogya. An intelligent surgeon, who does experimental surgery methodically, does not lose his presence of mind while doing the actual operations. Therefore, he who wants to be an expert in the use of surgical operations, caustics or thermal <b>cauterizations</b> should practice the same experimentally on similar subjects...|$|R
40|$|Background: Angiodysplasia of the {{duodenum}} {{is a rare}} disorder, often requiring surgical resection. Technical dif-ficulties {{have made}} {{the use of the}} minimally invasive approach uncommon. Herein, we present a subtotal pan-creas-preserving duodenectomy using robotic assistance. Methods: The patient is a 60 -y-old female with a long medical history including chronic gastrointestinal bleed-ing due to angiodysplasia with intermittent melena, and requiring multiples blood transfusions. A capsule endos-copy and double-balloon upper endoscopy showed an-giectasis, which appeared to be limited to the third and fourth portion of the duodenum and the proximal loops of the jejunum. Despite multiple endoscopic <b>cauterizations,</b> the patient continued to require blood transfusion for several years. The patient underwent a robot-assisted sub-total pancreas-preserving duodenectomy. Results: The operation lasted 420 min with minimal blood loss. The postoperative course was uneventful. The pathology report showed multiple small bowel mucosal and submucosal distorted and dilated vasculature, consis-tent with angiodysplasia. At 2 -mo follow-up, the patient was totally asymptomatic. A barium swallow study showed contrast passed antegrade through the duodeno-jejunostomy with no evidence of obstruction, stricture, or leakage. Conclusion: The use of robotic assistance to perform a subtotal pancreas-preserving duodenectomy for the treat-ment of benign duodenal disease, such as angiodysplasia, is feasible and safe. The technical advantages include a high degree of freedom offered by the robotic instru-ments, as well as enhanced visualization, which allows for precise microdissection and microsuture, thereby preserv-ing the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. The use of robotic technology allows for a wider range of indications for minimally invasive surgery...|$|R

Once the decoction was boiled thoroughly it could be drunk. Hua-t'o would tell the patient how to take the medicine and then would go away, after which the patient's condition would promptly improve.If Hua-t'o employed moxibustion, he would only burn punk in one or two places and in each place he only made seven or eight separate <b>cauterizations,</b> to which the disease would rapidly respond during the course of its elimination. If he employed acupuncture, it was also only in one or two places. As he instated the needle, he would instruct the patient, [...] "I am going to guide the point to such-and-such a spot. When you feel it reach there, tell me." [...] As soon as the patient told him that the point had already reached the designated spot, he would withdraw the needle and the sickness would likewise be virtually alleviated.If a sickness were concentrated internally where the effect of acupuncture needles and medicines could not reach it, Hua-t'o would recognize that it was necessary to operate. In such cases, he would have his patients drink a solution of morphean powder whereupon they would immediately become intoxicated as though dead and completely insensate. Then he could make an incision and remove the diseased tissues. If the disease were in the intestines, he would sever them and wash them out, after which he would stitch the abdomen together and rub on an ointment. After a period of about four or five days, there would be no more pain. The patient would gradually regain full consciousness and within a month he would return to normal. (tr.

40|$|OBJETIVOS: estudar a relação dos fatores biocomportamentais (idade, menarca, número de gestações e precocidade sexual) com alterações das células de Langerhans em mulheres com captura híbrida negativa para HPV. MÉTODOS: foram estudadas 30 mulheres com alterações citológicas ou lesão no colo uterino que foram submetidas aos exames de colposcopia, biópsia dirigida e histopatologia. As células de Langerhans foram identificadas pela reação de imuno-histoquímica com uso de antígenos anti-S 100. As células visualizadas em marron foram contadas utilizando o {{software}} Cytoviewer. Para análise estatística utilizou-se o teste não-paramétrico de soma das ordens de Wilcoxon. RESULTADOS: o número de células de Langerhans em mulheres com menarca após os 13 anos apresentou diferença significante (173, 34 cels/mm²) comparado ao grupo com menarca antes de 12 anos (271, 41 cel/mm²). A precocidade sexual associou-se ao baixo número de células de Langerhans com 127, 15 cels/mm² e 250, 14 cels/mm², respectivamente, para início da atividade até 17 anos e após 17 anos (p= 0, 03). Cauterizações anteriores do colo uterino foram relacionadas com o menor número de células de Langerhans, no epitélio com a média 120, 30 cels/mm² e 236, 06 cels/mm² para aquelas que nunca haviam sido submetidas a esse procedimento (p= 0, 05). Outros fatores como idade da paciente e número de gestações não foram relacionadas a alteração na densidade de células de Langerhans. CONCLUSÕES: o presente estudo observou associação de fatores biocomportamentais sobre o número das células de Langerhans. OBJECTIVE: {{to study}} the relationship of biobehavioral factors, such as age, menarche, number of gestations, and age of first sexual intercourse, with changes in Langerhans'cells in women with negative hybrid capture for HPV. METHODS: thirty women referred due to abnormal cervical cytology or premalignant cervical lesions were studied and underwent colposcopy, guided biopsy and histopathological exams. The Langerhans' cells were identified by immunohistochemical (S 100 +) exams. Langerhans' cells visualized in brown color were counted using the software Cytoviewer. The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test was employed for statistical analysis. RESULTS: the number of Langerhans' cells in women who had menarche after 13 years old presented statistically significant difference (173. 34 cell/mm²) compared to the group whose menarche occurred before 13 (271. 41 cell/mm²). The age at the first sexual intercourse {{was associated with the}} low number of Langerhans' cells, 127. 15 cell/mm² and 250. 14 cell/mm², respectively, for the beginning of the sexual activity up to 17 years old and after 17 (p= 0. 03). Previous <b>cauterizations</b> of the uterine cervix have been related to a lower number of Langerhans' cells in the epithelium, with the average 120. 30 cell/mm² as compared to 236. 06 cell/mm² for those women who never underwent that procedure (p= 0. 05). Other factors such as the patient's age and the number of gestations showed no statistically significant differences in the density of Langerhans' cells.

500|$|Albucasis (Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas Al-Zahrawi) used cautery for toothache, {{inserting}} a red-hot needle into the pulp of the tooth. The medieval surgeon Guy de Chauliac used a camphor, sulfur, myrrh, and asafetida mixture to fill teeth and cure toothworm and toothache. French anatomist Ambroise Paré recommended: [...] "Toothache is, of all others, the most atrocious pain that can torment a man, being followed by death.

Four pages later, he again opposes the opinion that gold is the best material for <b>cauterization,</b> stating that iron is actually his preferred metal: “therefore in our own opinion <b>cauterization</b> is swifter and more successful with iron”. In chapter twenty-nine, [...] "On <b>cauterization</b> for pleurisy", he states: “Now one of the Ancients mentioned that there were some people who used an iron cautery shaped like a probe, and introduced it red hot into the intercostal space until it reached the abscess itself and evacuated the pus…but in this perforation with the cautery there is a danger either that the patient may die on the spot or that an incurable fistula may raise at the place”.|$|E

Diode wavelengths range from 810 [...] to 1,100 nm, are poorly absorbed by soft tissue, and are not used for cutting or ablation. Soft tissue is not cut by the laser’s beam, but is instead cut by contact with a hot charred glass tip. The laser’s irradiation is highly absorbed at the distal end of the tip and heats it up to 500°C to 900°C.

The Edwin Smith Papyrus describes 8 cases of tumors or ulcers of the breast that were treated by <b>cauterization.</b> The writing says about the disease, [...] "There is no treatment." [...] For centuries, physicians described similar cases in their practices, with the same conclusion.

[...] Alternatively, patients often saw it as divine punishment. [...] In the 18th century, a wide variety of medical explanations were proposed, including a lack of sexual activity, too much sexual activity, physical injuries to the breast, curdled breast milk, and various forms of lymphatic blockages, either internal or due to restrictive clothing. [...] In the 19th century, the Scottish surgeon John Rodman said that fear of cancer caused cancer, and that this anxiety, learned by example from the mother, accounted for breast cancer's tendency to run in families.|$|E
2500|$|The beak is a complex, {{functional}} organ with {{an extensive}} nervous supply including nociceptors that sense pain and noxious stimuli.

[...] In Japanese quail, beak-trimming by <b>cauterization</b> caused lower body weights and feed intake in the period just after beak trimming. [...] Beak trimmed Muscovy ducks spent less time engaging in beak-related behaviours (preening, feeding, drinking, exploratory pecking) and more time resting than non-trimmed ducks in the days immediately post-trim. These differences disappeared by 1 week post-trim. At 1 week post-trim the trimmed ducks weighed less than non-trimmed ducks, but this difference disappeared by 2 weeks post-trim. [...] It is, however, unclear if the above changes in behaviour arise from pain or from a loss of sensitivity in the beak. [...] Pecking force has been found to decrease after beak trimming in adult hens possibly indicating that hens are protecting a painful area from further stimulation. However, pecking force did not differ between chicks with or without minor beak-trims at 2 to 9 days of age, suggesting that chicks with minor beak-trims do not experience pain from the beak.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{recommendations}} to have boys' trousers constructed {{so that the}} genitals could not be touched through the pockets, for schoolchildren to be seated at special desks to prevent their crossing their legs in class and for girls to be forbidden from riding horses and bicycles because the sensations these activities produce were considered too similar to masturbation.

Routine neonatal circumcision was widely adopted in the United States and the UK at least partly because of its believed preventive effect against masturbation (see also History of male circumcision).
