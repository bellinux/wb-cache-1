It is challenging to find a sufficiently expressive type system that satisfies all programming practices in a type safe manner.|$|E
25|$|Back in Arendelle, the Duke sees Ingrid {{sitting in}} a gazebo, but instead of waiting on Helga, he tries to seduce Ingrid, who then uses her power to push him away. When Helga arrives, he lies to her about what happened, but Helga knows that he lied and turns down his {{marriage}} proposal. As the Duke tells the two {{that he plans to}} expose Ingrid to all of Arendelle, Ingrid attempts to freeze the Duke, but he pulls Helga in front of him, causing Ingrid to freeze her instead. As a stunned Ingrid kneels by her frozen sister, Helga's body crumbles into a pile of ice shards. As Gerda shows up, she is stunned by what Ingrid did to Helga. Refusing to believe her and fearing that Ingrid has become a danger to everyone around her, Gerda takes the urn and traps a sobbing Ingrid inside. Later, Gerda goes to the Grand Pabbie and asks him to make a potion that will cause the residents of Arendelle to forget Ingrid and Helga ever existed {{in order to protect the}} future of the kingdom. He warns her that magic <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> but agrees to make the memory potion.|$|E
500|$|The {{reviews for}} Lights and Sounds were mostly mixed upon release, {{particularly}} from mainstream media, but {{some critics have}} stated that the album had fallen well short of the standards of Ocean Avenue, the album's predecessor. Kelefa Sanneh of the New York Times, in review of the album, wrote: [...] "To listeners {{on either side of}} rock's latest generational divide, there's a big difference -- the difference of a decade -- between being a loser and being a twerp... Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard's attempt to split that difference." [...] Sanneh reports that the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty", one of the band's anti-war song, [...] "sounds suspiciously like Green Day; the lyrics echo the plot of the video for Green Day's 'Wake Me Up When September Ends'." [...] Despite this, Sanneh {{goes on to say that}} Yellowcard is still [...] "pretty good" [...] at [...] "writing sweeping, upbeat punk-rock love songs". Ben Breier of Kent News wrote: [...] "One thing is certain: The Yellowcard you grew to know and love circa Ocean Avenue is no longer with us. The band has vastly matured when compared to past records, but it <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> [...] members forgot what made them occasionally catchy and addictive in the first place. It's clearly the right direction for the band, but Yellowcard needs to further refine its new style before it can come up with something above average." [...] Mike Schiller of PopMatters, who was somewhat displeased with the album, wrote that the album does not [...] "make up for the overabundance of flaccid mediocrity on display throughout most of the album". Schiller went on to say, [...] "Lights and Sounds may be Yellowcard’s attempt at a big, serious album, but the band doesn’t sound even remotely ready." [...] Nick Cowen from Drowned in Sound wrote: [...] "Those who register for Pop-Punk 101 will receive Yellowcard’s Lights And Sounds as their first set-work; the Jacksonville quintet's new album would be the perfect teaching aid, as it's technically proficient while being boring and forgettable enough not to inspire the temptation to plagiarise." [...] Cowen concluded that the album [...] "is a substandard, second-tier album with some strings thrown in for good measure. It's really not worth the money in your wallet [...] even if that wallet is attached to a very long chain." [...] Now magazine claimed that the band [...] "may be in the right place, it's clear they're simply incapable of realizing this clumsy faux magnum opus." ...|$|E

2500|$|Optimizing {{existing}} code {{usually does}} not add new features, and worse, it might add new bugs in previously working code (as any change might).

2500|$|Reviews of Dillo have praised its {{extraordinary}} speed, but {{noted that}} this speed <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price.</b> The most visible cost is Dillo's inability to display complex web pages as {{they were meant to}} be. A 2008 review by Linux.com commented that Dillo's user interface may be [...] "intimidating" [...] for new users, and pointed out the scarcity of plug-ins for Dillo. In all, Dillo's global usage share is less than one hundredth of one percent. Many of these deficiencies {{can be attributed to the}} simple lack of manpower behind development.|$|E

50|$|But success <b>came</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>price.</b> The paper's staff became {{increasingly}} insular, refusing to recruit members as older staffers graduated, believing itself capable of running on nothing.

50|$|HeroQuest {{could be}} {{considered}} the grandfather of Descent, with characters assigned to the players, and equipment purchased before descending into a dungeon region to solve quests.
