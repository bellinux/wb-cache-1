In this paper, we define three substitutability notions for services.

To guarantee that S 0 <b>cooperates</b> <b>with</b> a fixed subset of environments that S <b>cooperates</b> <b>with,</b> the notion of deprecation can be used. For each substitutability notion we present a decision algorithm. To this end we apply the concept of an operating guideline of a service as an abstract representation of all environments the service <b>cooperates</b> <b>with...</b>|$|R

5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by <b>cooperating</b> <b>with</b> each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.|$|E
