Easier to acquire power estimates have been proposed- including mean and simplified power. These require only echo Doppler flow and cuff pressures, but their relationship to invasively derived results has not been studied. Using a well-validated numerical model of the cardiovascular system, different estimates of power were compared for varying preload, afterload, and contractility. All power results were divided by EDV 2. Estimates of power correlate with peak power {{over a wide range}} of physiology. <b>Corrected</b> <b>power</b> estimates were independent of preload and afterload, but predictably increased with contractility.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} locating error sources in an erroneous combinational or sequential circuit. We use a fault simulation-based technique to approximate each internal signal’s <b>correcting</b> <b>power.</b> The <b>correcting</b> <b>power</b> of a particular signal is {{measured in terms of}} the signal’s correctable set, namely, the maximum set of erroneous input vectors or sequences that can be corrected by resynthesizing the signal. Only the signals that can correct every given erroneous input vector or sequence are considered as a potential error source. Our algorithm offers three major advantages over existing methods. First, unlike symbolic approaches, it is applicable for large circuits. Second, it delivers more accurate results than other simulation-based approaches because it is based on a more stringent condition for identifying potential error sources. Third, it can be generalized to identify multiple errors theoretically. Experimental results on diagnosing combinational and sequential circuits with one and two random errors are presented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of this new approach.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{optimization}} and correction procedures for the determination of peak power output during friction-loaded cycle ergometry. Ten male and 10 female sports students each performed five 10 - s sprints from a stationary start on a Monark 864 basket- loaded ergometer. Resistive loads of 5. 0, 6. 5, 8. 0, 9. 5, and 11. 0 % body weight were administered in a counterbalanced order, with a recovery period of 10 min between sprints. Peak power was greater and occurred earlier, with less work having been done before the attainment of peak power, when the data were corrected to account for the inertial and frictional characteristics of the ergometer. <b>Corrected</b> peak <b>power</b> was independent of resistive load (P > 0. 05), whereas uncorrected peak power varied as a quadratic function of load (P > 0. 001). For males and females, optimized peak power (971 +/- 122 and 668 +/- 37 W) was lower (P < 0. 01) than either the highest (1074 +/- 111 and 754 +/- 56 W respectively) or the mean (1007 +/- 125 and 701 +/- 45 W respectively) of the five values for <b>corrected</b> peak <b>power.</b> Optimized and mean <b>corrected</b> peak <b>power</b> were highly correlated both in males (r = 0. 97, P < 0. 001) and females (r = 0. 96, P < 0. 001). The difference between optimized and mean <b>corrected</b> peak <b>power</b> was 37 + 30 W in males and 33 +/- 14 W in females, of which approximately 15 W was due to the correction for frictional losses.

One {{of the most popular}} methods of assessment of power output during short-term maximal of exercise is the Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT), but this test suffers from serious conceptual limitations. Therefore, the first aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation of <b>correct</b> <b>power</b> measurement in the WAnT. The second aim was to design and construct a pair of force pedals, and the last objective was to use these pedals to analyse the force application and power output of elite sprint cyclists during maximal ergometry. The inertial and frictional characteristics of Monark ergometer flywheels were assessed using 'run-down' techniques. Moments of Inertia of 0. 411 (± 0. 001) and 0. 396 (± 0. 002) kg. m. 2 were found for the two Monark 864 ergometers measured, with the newer 814 ergometer possessing a value of 0. 962 (± 0. 003) kg. m. 2. Frictional torques of 0. 0025 (± 0. 0030) to 0. 1720 (± 0. 00 16) N. m. were found, depending on the attachments to the flywheel and chainset. These values were then utilised to <b>correct</b> the <b>power</b> outputs obtained during the WAnT. <b>Corrected</b> <b>powers</b> were found to produce significantly (P< 0. 001) larger peak and mean power outputs than those obtained using uncorrected methods. The methods used also produced significantly different (P< 0. 01) <b>corrected</b> <b>power</b> outputs to those of Lakomy (1986), who utilised an incorrect method of'acceleration-correction'. The force pedals were found to be highly linear in calibration and force measurement, as well as suitable for ergometer cycling. These were then used to test elite sprint cyclists on a modified Monark ergometer. The results of the sprint testing of cyclists found no overall significant difference between power measured indirectly (at the flywheel) and that measured at the pedals. There were significant differences between flywheel and pedal power outputs at high pedal velocity, and this was attributed to large crank torques, in agreement with Sjøgaard (1978). Also noted were differences in force application patterns between cyclists, indicating the use of a variety of pedalling techniques. It was concluded that inertial correction of the WAnT is mandatory for the accurate measurement of power output, and that this needs to be based on sound mechanical principles. This study has also shown that is possible to measure power accurately using indirect methods. However, if the individual techniques of elite sprint cyclists are to be examined in detail, it is necessary to utilise force pedals...|$|R
