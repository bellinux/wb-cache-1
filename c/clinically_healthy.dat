Thirty-one were randomly assigned to 3 -month intensive lifestyle intervention and 31 served as controls. Sixty-one participants performed a maximal treadmill walking test with metabolic gas exchange. Baseline anthropometric measures were closely related to HRR at 1 min, which may indicate reduced parasympathetic reactivation. Post-exercise HRR at 60 s (HRR 60) increased from 21. 3 ± 6. 2 to 27. 8 ± 10. 2 bpm in the intervention group compared with a smaller reduction (26. 8 ± 12. 3 to 24. 5 ± 9. 9 bpm) in controls (test for interaction P= 0. 0001). HRR 120 showed a significant effect of time (P= 0. 0002) with no significant interaction with lifestyle intervention.

40|$|Drugs {{that cause}} strong hERG {{potassium}} channel block (e. g., dofetilide, quinidine) cause T-wave notching.

However, the role of M cells in intact human hearts is debated. We simulated 2025 electrocardiograms representing changes in ventricular action potentials using the equivalent double layer mode that does not include M-cells. Action potential changes included prolongation, triangularization, squaring, and bumps in late repolarization, which have been observed experimentally and in single cell models with block of the hERG potassium channel. Changes were applied globally and spatially dispersed. Action potential bumps (slowing in late repolarization) produced T-wave notching similar to that observed <b>clinically</b> in <b>healthy</b> subjects receiving dofetilide or quinidine.

The Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) is a disease specific health instrument that measures functional ability in daily living activities in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) is a generic health instrument designed to capture the physical and psychosocial well-being of children independently from the underlying disease. The Belgian-Flemish CHAQ was fully validated with 3 forward and 3 backward translations, while the Belgian-Flemish CHQ was equal to the Dutch version and revalidated in this study. The French version of both CHAQ and CHQ was exactly the same as the one used in France. A total of 199 subjects were enrolled: 53 patients with JIA (11 % systemic onset, 40 % polyarticular onset, 13 % extended oligoarticular subtype, and 36 % persistent oligoarticular subtype) and 146 healthy children. The CHAQ <b>clinically</b> discriminated between <b>healthy</b> subjects and JIA patients, with the polyarticular onset, and extended oligoarticular subtypes having a higher degree of disability, pain, and a lower overall well-being when compared to their healthy peers. Also the CHQ <b>clinically</b> discriminated between <b>healthy</b> subjects and JIA patients, with the polyarticular onset and extended oligoarticular subtypes having a lower physical and psychosocial well-being when compared to their healthy peers.

While there was early {{evidence to suggest that}} B. bronchiseptica could be shed for many months post-infection, a more recent report places detectable nasal and pharyngeal levels of B. bronchiseptica in 45.6% of all <b>clinically</b> <b>healthy</b> dogs. This has potentially expanded the vector from currently or recently infected dogs to half the dog population as carriers. To put the relative levels of shedding bacteria into perspective, a study analyzing the shedding kinetics of B. bronchiseptica presents the highest levels of bacterial shedding one week post-exposure, with an order of magnitude decrease in shedding observed every week. [...] This projection places negligible levels of shedding to be expected 6 weeks post-exposure (or ~5 weeks post-onset of symptoms). Dogs which had been administered intranasal vaccine 4 weeks prior to virulent B. bronchiseptica challenge displayed little to no bacterial shedding within 3 weeks of exposure to the virulent strain.|$|E
50|$|As the {{original}} sulcular depth increases and the apical migration of the junctional epithelium has simultaneously occurred, the pocket is now lined by pocket epithelium (PE) instead of junctional epithelium (JE). To have a true periodontal pocket, a probing measurement of 4 mm or more must be clinically evidenced. In this state, {{much of the}} gingival fibers that initially attached the gingival tissue to the tooth have been irreversibly destroyed. The depth of the periodontal pockets must be recorded in the patient record for proper monitoring of periodontal disease. Unlike in <b>clinically</b> <b>healthy</b> situations, parts of the sulcular epithelium can sometimes be seen in periodontally involved gingival tissue if air is blown into the periodontal pocket, exposing the newly denuded roots of the tooth. A periodontal pocket can become an infected space and may result in an abscess formation with a papule on the gingival surface. Incision and drainage of the abscess may be necessary, as well as systemic antibiotics; placement of local antimicrobial delivery systems within the periodontal pocket to reduce localized infections may also be considered.It is classified as supra bony and infra bony based on its depth in relation to alveolar bone.|$|E

Two groups of IgAd individuals, one frequently infected and one <b>clinically</b> apparently <b>healthy,</b> as well as normal controls, were studied. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and B cells from IgAd individuals and controls were cultured with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I strain and with anti-CD 40 MoAb presented on the CD 32 -transfected fibroblast cell line {{in the presence of}} IL- 10. In this experimental system PBMC and B cells from the infection-prone IgAd individuals produced only minute amounts of IgA. In contrast, PBMC and B cells from healthy IgAd subjects secreted significantly more IgA 1 and IgA 2 in comparison with infection-prone IgAd patients (P < 0. 05). These data suggest that the abnormalities of B cell differentiation in IgAd could be of heterogeneous origin. Thus, whereas in healthy IgAd subjects IgA production may be efficiently up-regulated in vitro by addition of IL- 10 to CD 40 -activated B cell culture, the corresponding B cell differentiation does not occur in infection-prone IgAd patients. These observations provide a conceptual framework for phenotypic heterogeneity in IgAd subjects...|$|R

Two groups of IgAd individuals, one frequently infected and one <b>clinically</b> apparently <b>healthy,</b> as well as healthy controls, were studied. In response to meningococcal A + C polysaccharide vaccine, a significant titre increase of specific IgG 2 anti-PSA was found in 71 % of the control individuals, in 50 % of the healthy and in 42 % of the infection-prone IgAd individuals. The specific IgG 2 response against meningococcal PSA was significantly lower in the infection-prone IgAd individuals compared to the controls (P < 0. 05). Among the IgAd individuals who responded with a significant IgG 2 antibody increase, the IgG 2 antibody response was significantly lower in the infection-prone than in the healthy IgAd individuals (P < 0. 05). Thus, a limited capacity to mount a specific IgG 2 response may suggest a more profound antibody maturation defect in infection-prone IgAd patients compared to healthy IgAd individuals...|$|R

50|$|The {{clinical}} {{utility of}} ctDNA {{for the detection}} of primary disease is in part limited by the sensitivity of current technology; there are low levels of ctDNA present, and driver mutations are unknown. Recently, a team at John Hopkins assessed the ability to detect ctDNA using digital PCR in 640 patients with various types of cancer. ctDNA was detected in only 48% to 73% of cases, suggesting that ctDNA may be a poor method for early cancer detection, since not all patients had detectable levels of ctDNA. Similar findings were observed by Heitzer et al., who analyzed ctDNA from colorectal patients. Importantly, in a study conducted by Kopreski et al., mutations in KRAS, an oncogene commonly mutated in colorectal cancer, were detected in the colorectal tissue of otherwise <b>clinically</b> <b>healthy</b> individuals. In fact, 58% of individuals with detectable KRAS mutations showed no evidence of neoplasia on colonoscopy, which may be indicative of false positivity. However, because no follow-up studies were pursued within this cohort, it is possible that these represent premalignant lesions. Taken together, these results suggest that the use of ctDNA as a biomarker in the context of cancer screening is limited both by sensitivity and specificity.|$|E

We analysed the levels of 22 biomarkers in <b>clinically</b> classified <b>healthy</b> controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s participants from the well characterised Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging. High levels of IL- 10 and IL- 12 / 23 p 40 were significantly associated with amyloid deposition in HC, suggesting that these two biomarkers might be used to detect at risk individuals. Additionally, other biomarkers (Eotaxin- 3, Leptin, PYY) exhibited altered levels in AD participants possessing the APOE ε 4 allele. This suggests that the physiology of some potential biomarkers may be altered in AD due to the APOE ε 4 allele, a major risk factor for AD.

40|$|The {{development}} of effective multi-modality imaging methods typically requires an efficient information fusion model, particularly when combining structural images with a complementary imaging modality that provides functional information. We propose a composition-based image segmentation method for X-ray digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and a structural-prior-guided image reconstruction for a combined DBT and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) breast imaging system. Using the 3 D DBT images from 31 <b>clinically</b> measured <b>healthy</b> breasts, we create an empirical {{relationship between the}} X-ray intensities for adipose and fibroglandular tissue. We use this relationship to then segment another 58 healthy breast DBT images from 29 subjects into compositional maps of different tissue types. For each breast, we build a weighted-graph in the compositional space and construct a regularization matrix to incorporate the structural priors into a finite-element-based DOT image reconstruction. Use of the compositional priors enables us to fuse tissue anatomy into optical images with less restriction than when using a binary segmentation. This allows us to recover the image contrast captured by DOT but not by DBT. We show {{that it is possible}} to fine-tune the strength of the structural priors by changing a single regularization parameter. By estimating the optical properties for adipose and fibroglandular tissue using the proposed algorithm, we found the results are comparable or superior to those estimated with expert-segmentations, but does not involve the time-consuming manual selection of regions-of-interest...|$|R

Some studies offer evidence that mindfulness practices are beneficial for the brain's self-regulation by increasing activity in the anterior cingulate cortex. A shift from using the right prefrontal cortex is claimed to be associated with a trend away from depression and anxiety, and towards happiness, relaxation, and emotional balance.|$|R

Here we simultaneously tracked microbiota development at plaque and saliva in 50 4 -year-old preschoolers for 2 years; children either stayed healthy, transitioned into cariogenesis, or experienced caries exacerbation. Caries onset delayed microbiota development, which is otherwise correlated with aging in healthy children. Both plaque and saliva microbiota are more correlated with changes in ECC severity (dmfs) during onset than progression. By distinguishing between aging- and disease-associated taxa and exploiting the distinct microbiota dynamics between onset and progression, we developed a model, Microbial Indicators of Caries, to diagnose ECC from healthy samples with 70 % accuracy and predict, with 81 % accuracy, future ECC onsets for samples <b>clinically</b> perceived as <b>healthy.</b> Thus, caries onset in apparently healthy teeth can be predicted using microbiota, when appropriately de-trended for age...|$|R
