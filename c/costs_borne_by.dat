5|$|The fee for {{the grant}} of arms is due when the {{memorial}} is submitted, the amount being {{laid out in the}} Earl Marshal's Warrant. As of 1 January 2016 the fees for a personal grant of arms, including a crest is £5,875, a grant to a non-profit body is £12,375 and to a commercial company is £18,350. This grant however does not include a grant of a badge, supporters or a standard, their inclusion into the grant requires extra fees. The fees mainly go towards commissioning the artwork and calligraphy on the vellum Letters Patent, which must be done by hand and in a sense a work of art in itself, plus other administrative <b>costs</b> <b>borne</b> <b>by</b> the heralds and for the upkeep of the College.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} location choice that draws on insights from the incomplete contracts and investment flexibility (real option) literatures. Our analysis indicates that the choice of locating within rather than away from industry clusters {{is influenced by the}} extent to which training <b>costs</b> are <b>borne</b> <b>by</b> firms versus employees. In addition, the uncertainty about future productivity shocks and the ability of firms to modify the scale of their operations also influence location choice. In particular, we show that locating in clusters is preferred when training <b>costs</b> are <b>borne</b> <b>by</b> workers and when firm-specific productivity shocks can potentially be large. However, there is an incentive for firms to choose isolated locations when significant training <b>costs</b> are <b>borne</b> <b>by</b> firms.

40|$|A {{so-called}} "incentive contract " is {{a linear}} payment schedule, where the buyer pays a fixed fee plus some proportion of audited project cost. That remaining proportion of project <b>cost</b> <b>borne</b> <b>by</b> the seller {{is called the}} "sharing ratio. " A higher sharing ratio creates more incentive to reduce costs. But it also makes the agent <b>bear</b> more <b>cost</b> un-certainty, requiring as compensation a greater fixed fee. The tradeoff between incen-tives and risk in determining the sharing ratio of an efficient contract is the central theme of the present paper. A formula is derived that shows how the optimal sharing ratio depends on such features as uncertainty, risk aversion, and the contractor's ability to control costs. Some numerical examples are calculated from the area of defense contracting. SUMMARY This paper analyzes the widely used "incentive contract"—a linear payment schedule where the buyer pays a fixed fee plus some proportion of project cost.

50|$|Cost of {{conflict}} {{is a tool}} which attempts to calculate the price {{of conflict}} to the human race.

The approach considers direct costs of conflict, for instance human deaths, expenditure, destruction of land and physical infrastructure; as well as indirect costs that impact a society, for instance migration, humiliation, growth of extremism and lack of civil society.|$|E

5000|$|To explain sticky wages, Hall {{emphasizes}} the importance of <b>costs</b> <b>borne</b> <b>by</b> the employer. Firms benefit when times are good but are penalized when times are slim (because wages are usually fixed) and they pay for searching for a good employee/employer match. Thus, employers are more risk averse in hiring and have less incentive to engage in search. Hence employers simply do not hire in down times. This idea is reinforced because workers cannot collectively signal that they would work for less in down times, wages have a tendency to stick upwards.|$|E
