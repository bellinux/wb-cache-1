40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe ROK-U. S. alliance {{is facing a}} new security circumstance due {{to the rise of}} China and the deepening nuclear ambition of the DPRK, along with U. S. military spending reduction by the sequestration. The research question of this thesis is this: How has U. S. military spending affected the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> the ROK-U. S. alliance since 1953 ? No studies have researched the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> the ROK-U. S. alliance through robust empirical analysis. To answer this question empirically, this thesis examines three indicators for measuring the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> the ROK-U. S. alliance: institutionalization, capacity of the USFK, and the ROK-U. S. combined exercises. In addition, this thesis analyzes three categories of the U. S. military spending to determine whether a certain relation exists between the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> the ROK-U. S. alliance and U. S. military spending. Through empirical analysis, this thesis concludes that there is no certain relationship between the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> the ROK-U. S. alliance and U. S. military spending. Comparing two variables, the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> the ROK-U. S. alliance and U. S. military spending, this thesis found a striking difference between the Cold War and the Post-Cold War. Based on the variable findings, this thesis explores the implications for future tasks for the ROK-U. S. alliance under new security circumstances. Major, Republic of Korea Air Forc...|$|R

Membranes isolated from {{cells in the}} log phase of growth gave complete inhibition <b>of</b> log-phase cell <b>cohesion.</b> This effect was specific for the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> log-phase cells mediated by contact sites B, since the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> aggregation-competent cells which have acquired contact sites A was only partially inhibited by log-phase plasma membranes. Mem-branes isolated from stationary phase cells gave partial inhibition <b>of</b> log-phase cell <b>cohesion,</b> while membranes from aggregation-competent cells gave complete inhibition <b>of</b> log-phase cell <b>cohesion</b> but at much higher concentration than log membranes. Treatment of log-phase cells with cycloheximide for 8 h rendered them completely non-cohesive. Membranes from cyclo-heximide-treated cells {{had no effect on}} log-phase cell cohesion.

40|$|Class {{cohesion}} {{is considered}} {{as one of the}} most important object-oriented software attributes. High cohesion is, in fact, a desirable property of software. Many different metrics have been suggested in the last several years to measure the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> classes in object-oriented systems. The class <b>of</b> structural object-oriented <b>cohesion</b> metrics is the most in-vestigated category <b>of</b> <b>cohesion</b> metrics. These metrics measure cohesion on structural information extracted from the source code. Empirical studies noted that these metrics fail in many situations to properly reflect <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> classes. This paper aims at exploring the use of hierarchical clustering techniques to improve the measurement <b>of</b> <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> classes in object-oriented systems. The proposed approach has been evaluated using three particular case studies. We also used in our study three well-known structural cohesion metrics. The achieved results show that the new approach appears to better reflect the <b>cohesion</b> (and structure) <b>of</b> classes than traditional structural cohesion metrics...|$|R

40|$|The <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> a {{class or}} object is {{equivalent}} to the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> a module; that is, it can be expressed in terms <b>of</b> the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> a module at an equivalent level of abstraction. Similarly, the coupling between classes and objects always corresponds to classical (module-based) coupling. It is therefore a source of confusion to refer to object-oriented cohesion or object-oriented coupling. These results are then extended to object-oriented metrics in general. For a metric to be strictly object-oriented, it is necessary for that metric to be inheritance-related. But inheritance, though necessary, is not sufficient; for example, coupling in the object-oriented paradigm can be induced by inheritance, but is nevertheless always equivalent to coupling as it is found in the module-based (classical) paradigm.

40|$|Abstract: High {{cohesion}} is {{a desirable}} property of software as it positively impacts understanding, reuse, and maintenance. Currently proposed measures for cohesion in Object-Oriented (OO) software reflect particular interpretations <b>of</b> <b>cohesion</b> and capture {{different aspects of}} it. Existing approaches are largely based on using the structural information from the source code, such as attribute references, in methods to measure cohesion. This paper proposes a new measure for the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> classes in OO software systems based on {{the analysis of the}} unstructured information embedded in the source code, such as comments and identifiers. The measure, named the Conceptual <b>Cohesion</b> <b>of</b> Classes (C 3), is inspired by the mechanisms used to measure textual coherence in cognitive psychology and computational linguistics. This paper presents the principles and the technology that stand behind the C 3 measure. An open source eclipse plug-in is developed as part of this research work to demonstrate how well <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> classes is predicted using C 3 metrics...|$|R

Snow builds up as snowfall continues and it eventually reaches {{a point at which}} the weight of the snowfall overcomes the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> the snow, resulting in an avalanche. Rising temperatures may have also had an effect, {{due to the fact that}} temperature rise can affect the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> snow. These snowstorms have also hampered rescue efforts, with some areas receiving nearly a meter of snow.|$|R

The research was a quantitative, descriptive, correlational, and cross country. The population consisted of 334 employees, of which a sample of 211. To collect datatwo instruments were developed: the first aimed at measuring the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> teams and the second focused on measuring the perceived work environment, comprised of 20 items each. As a result it was observed that there is a significant positive linear relationship stronger grade between the variable cohesive work teams (CET) andthe variable labor climate (CL). When running the test statistic r value was found to. 803 and a significance level of. 000 p. The results of the investigation showed that there is a significant positive linear relationship stronger grade between the variable <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> teams (CET) and the variable labor climate (CL).

40|$|Adaptive or {{generated}} narratives offer personalised and dy- namic {{delivery of}} narrative content to users. However their generation or adaption is {{often based on}} the literal content of the narrative and not the subtext ignoring many impor- tant narrative principles such as narrative cohesion. Based on our existing work on a thematic model we present the Thematic Illustrator; a system capable of generating content relevant themed illustrations for short stories. The system aims to emphasise core themes {{and as a result}} improve the thematic <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> the story. We investigate whether this has a tangible effect on the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> the narrative as a whole by using five variables to measure the <b>cohesion</b> <b>of</b> a story with themed and unthemed illustrations. Our results show that thematic noise can be reduced {{and that there is a}} demonstrated link between thematic cohesion and some other aspects <b>of</b> narrative <b>cohesion...</b>|$|R
