5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's father had been a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{innovation}} {{may sometimes}} begin in Lamarckian style with epigenetic alterations of gene regulation or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> the gene level. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, {{as well as}} nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B. Müller have suggested that organisms early {{in the history of}} multicellular life were more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early macroevolutionary changes.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Planica event and following numerous near-flat ground landings, it became clear that ski flying had once again outgrown an older hill and needed enlarging in the years to come. In 2005, almost immediately after the conclusion of the World Cup season, talks were under way to upgrade the hill in Vikersund. This became a reality in mid-2010, when the FIS announced major rule <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> the 47th International Ski Congress in Antalya, Turkey, to allow for ski flying hills to be constructed to their largest sizes yet.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} 2010–11 Seahawks-Saints playoff game, McKay wanted {{to revisit the}} {{previous}} proposal to reseed teams during wild-card weekend. However, sportswriter Peter King wrote that he believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> this time due to the then-pending 2011 work stoppage, the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games {{and how it will}} impact the postseason, and the simple fact that not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged by the current format.|$|E

5|$|As Moratti {{prepared}} to make wholesale <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> the club, Bergkamp left Inter and signed with Arsenal in June 1995 for a transfer fee estimated at £7.5million. He became manager Bruce Rioch's first signing at Arsenal and broke the club's transfer fee record set at £2.5million. Bergkamp's arrival at the club was significant not only {{because he was a}}n established international footballer who looked to have his best years ahead of him, but also because he was a major contributor to Arsenal's return to success after much decline in the mid-1990s. On the opening day of the 1995–96 league season, Bergkamp made his full debut against Middlesbrough. He struggled to adapt to the English game and failed to score in the club's next six league matches, prompting ridicule by the national press. On 23 September 1995, Bergkamp scored his first and second goals for Arsenal against Southampton at Highbury. Bergkamp ended his first season with 33 appearances and 11 goals, helping Arsenal finish fifth and earn a place in the UEFA Cup by scoring the winner against Bolton Wanderers {{on the final day of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|By 1867 the Sheffield Rules was the {{dominant}} code in England. The FA had still not achieved the national dominance it enjoys today. Its membership had shrunk to just 10clubs {{and at a}} meeting of the FA it was reported that only three clubs (No Names Club, Barnes and Crystal Palace) were playing by the FA code. At the same meeting the secretary of Sheffield Club suggested three rule <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> an FA meeting: the adoption of rouges, the one man offside and introduction of a free kick for handling the ball. None of the motions were successful. Later in the same year, they abolished handling and touchdowns. It was stated that this was to bring them closer to non-handling games.|$|E
5|$|Camber Castle {{went through}} several <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> {{the start of}} the 17th century. In 1610, Peter Temple was {{appointed}} as captain of the castle, and between 1610 and 1614 the garrison was reduced to 14 soldiers, including only 4 gunners, either as an effort to reduce costs or {{as a result of the}} changing types of artillery kept at the castle. The north and south bastions were filled in to form solid gun platforms around approximately 1613 and 1615, and an earth rampart called the Rampire was built up against the south corner of the castle. These solid bastions would have sacrificed living space, less in demand with a smaller garrison, but been much cheaper to maintain. Longbows fell out of use in warfare as archery in England declined, and were replaced by arquebuses and muskets, 46 of which were kept at the castle in 1614.|$|E

5|$|During his 16-year stay at CRGS, student numbers {{increased}} from 29 to 180 boys under his guidance, particularly through {{the introduction of}} day pupils.

5|$|Gran Trak 10 was {{developed}} {{during a time}} of several internal <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> Atari; as a result communication problems led Atari to not accurately track the expense of manufacturing the game. It was initially sold to distributors for a net loss of US$100 per cabinet; although this flaw was fixed it contributed to a total loss of $500,000 for the company that fiscal year, placing Atari in financial difficulties. The game itself was successful, and led to several versions of the game being produced in 1974 by Atari and its subsidiary Kee Games, including a smaller cabinet version titled Trak 10 and a two-player version titled Gran Trak 20, as well as numerous later racing games. Gran Trak 10 was the first arcade car racing game, though Atari had released the drag racing game Space Race in 1973, and a simple racing game, Wipeout, was included with the 1972 Magnavox Odyssey console.|$|E
5|$|However, {{contrary}} to {{the expectations of the}} Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex, rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve. The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills. A principal alternative view to the Red Queen hypothesis is that sex arose, and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that genetic variation is produced as a byproduct.|$|E

5|$|Like all metal type revivals, {{reviving}} Gill Sans {{in digital}} form raises several decisions of interpretation, such as {{the issue of how}} to compensate for the ink spread that would have been seen in print at small sizes more than larger. As a result, printed Gill Sans and its digital facsimile may not always match. The digital release of Gill Sans, like many Monotype digitisations, has been criticised, in particular for excessively tight letter-spacing and lack of optical sizes: with only one design released that has to be used at any text size, it cannot replicate the subtlety of design and spacing of the metal type, for which every size was drawn differently. In the hot metal era the structure of the font varied by size as is normal for metal type, with wider spacing and other detail <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> smaller text sizes. In the phototype period Monotype continued to offer two or three sizes of master, but all of this subtlety was lost on transfer to digital. To replicate this, it is necessary to make manual adjustment to spacing to compensate for size changes, such as expanding the spacing and increasing the weight used at smaller sizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E
