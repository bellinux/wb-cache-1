40|$|OBJECTIVE: One {{expression}} of the core psychopathology of eating disorders is the repeated <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance of shape or weight. Two studies are reported. The {{primary purpose of the}} first was to describe the phenomenology of such body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance. The aim of the second was to compare body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance in women with and without a clinical eating disorder. METHOD: In Study 1, 64 female patients with clinical eating disorders participated in a semistructured interview assessing the features of body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance. In the second study, a self-report questionnaire was used to compare body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance in women with and without a clinical eating disorder (n = 110). RESULTS: The majority (92 %) of the patients in Study 1 checked their bodies to assess their shape or weight and this was associated significantly with eating disorder symptoms. In Study 2, the clinical group had significantly more body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance than the comparison group, and there was a strong association between eating disorder psychopathology <b>and</b> body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the view that body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance are direct expressions of the overevaluation of shape and weight.

However, the associations between these behaviors and mental and physical health-related quality of life have not been examined. This study investigated the associations between body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> avoidance and quality of life in 214 community women. Body <b>checking</b> <b>and</b> body avoidance were significantly correlated with mental and physical quality of life, as well as with eating disturbances. Frequency of body checking significantly predicted impairment in mental quality of life, and frequency of body avoidance significantly predicted impairment in physical quality of life, over and above the contributions of depressive symptoms and related demographic characteristics.

5|$|There {{are several}} <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> {{balances}} {{built into the}} state constitution that limit {{the power of the}} General Assembly. Other clauses allow the General Assembly to balance and limit the authority of the other branches of the government. Among these <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances is the governor's authority to veto any bill passed by the General Assembly. The General Assembly may in turn override his veto by simple majority vote in both houses. Bills passed by a super majority automatically become law without requiring the signature of the governor. Once the bill is made law, it can be challenged in the state courts which may rule the law to be unconstitutional, effectively repealing the law. The General Assembly could then override the court's decision by amending the state constitution to include the law. The General Assembly has historically been the most powerful branch of the state government, dominating a weak governor's office. Although the governor has gained more power in the past fifty years, the General Assembly still retains the power to remove much of that authority.|$|E

These included former Republican governor William S. Taylor (18991900) and Taylor's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers. Henry Youtsey, who was convicted for complicity in the assassination but turned state's evidence, was not pardoned, leading Democrats to portray the pardons of Taylor and Powers as partisan.

5|$|According to the classicist J. C. Stobart, Tiberius's Greek {{education}} had {{caused him to}} overestimate {{the reliability of the}} people as a powerbase, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune the people lacked anywhere near the influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time – and there were several other <b>checks</b> <b>and</b> balances to prevent power being concentrated on any one person. Stobart adds that another reason for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were deaf to the baser notes of human nature and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.|$|E

(The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the Sunday Times in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} the {{shutdown}} began, all state government spending and operations {{not considered to be}} critical stopped. Suspended state services included driving tests, childcare assistance, senior and disability linkage lines, criminal background <b>checks,</b> <b>and</b> road construction. State government offices, state parks, highway rest areas, and sites run by the Minnesota Historical Society, among others, closed. The commissioner of the Department of Human Services, Lucinda Jesson, said that letters had to be sent to over 580,000 households that relied on the department for social services to notify them about the possible shutdown. More critical parts of the state government, including public safety, health care, benefit payments, and care for residents of state facilities continued. Services that were continued during the shutdown could have amounted to as much as 80 percent of state spending.|$|E
