The line is {{currently}} 20 km long and has 14 stations, which are all underground. When the line is completed, it will have 32.2 km of tracks and 21 stations, of which 17.4 km of tracks and 10 stations will be located in Guangzhou. It was expected to start construction in 2002 with a tentative opening in 2009. However, due to <b>capital</b> <b>shortage,</b> its construction was claimed to be suspended until it resumed in 2007. The section between Kuiqilu (魁奇路) and Xilang (西朗) was completed in 2010 while the route between Xilang and Lijiao (...) will be completed in 2016.

50|$|To enhance {{predictive}} power, {{the retrospective}} SES measure was extended and modified in later research. The enhanced model is called SRISK, which evaluates the expected capital shortfall for a firm {{in a crisis}} scenario. To calculate this SRISK, one should first determine the Long-Run Marginal Expected Shortfall (LRMES), which measures {{the relationship between a}} firm’s equity returns and the market’s return (estimated using asymmetric volatility, correlation, and copula). Then, the model estimates the drop in the firm’s equity value if the aggregate market experiences a 40% or larger fall in a six-month period to determine how much capital is needed in order to achieve an 8% capital to asset value ratio. In other words, SRISK gives insights into the firm’s percentage of total financial sector capital shortfall. A high SRISK % indicates the biggest losers when a crisis strikes. One implication of the SES indicator is that a firm is considered “systemically risky” if it faces a high probability of <b>capital</b> <b>shortage</b> when the financial sector is weak.|$|E
30|$|Second, an economy’s {{openness}} {{can also}} lead to a higher labor productivity by fostering capital accumulation. This is the essence of the financial flow channel. Improved access to international capital (markets) facilitates overcoming domestic <b>capital</b> <b>shortages</b> by <b>capital</b> imports. Hence, a higher capital stock leads to higher labor productivity and stronger economic growth compared to economies in which capital is scarce.|$|R

30|$|Obviously, the countervailing debt is {{different}} from “chain debts.” “Chain debts” are a circulation chain of lending to each other. In the condition of <b>capital</b> <b>shortage,</b> {{it would lead to}} the accumulation of debts as a kind of cumulative debt relations. However, the countervailing debts discussed here and loans on the basis of social time mechanism form a kind of mutual debt relation with no cumulative relations as in chain debts. Additionally, the character of mutual debt relations also indicates that it dispels debt relations: first, {{there is no need to}} pay interest depending on the social time mechanism; second, countervailing debt dispels or countervails the problem of <b>capital</b> <b>shortage</b> caused by previous debt relations even though it requires some costs, for example, higher interest rates have to be paid because of the fixed cooperation relations or debts. Therefore, with the counterdebt mechanism, there is no large scale of the capital chain collapsing due to <b>capital</b> <b>shortage</b> upstream. It is also a crucial part of maintaining the constant operation of SMEs.|$|E

30|$|Even {{though more}} stable {{graduated}} debts and cost allocation were built through the social time mechanism, the upstream material suppliers or the households upstream still occasionally encountered <b>capital</b> <b>shortage</b> due to accidents. These financial needs possibly emerged because payment from the downstream subcontractors {{did not occur}} before the capital settlement period based on social time or because the daily expenses exceeded the payments advanced by the subcontractors. In {{order to keep the}} upstream alive, the downstream subcontractors were obliged to support the upstream, forming a countervailing mechanism between the subcontractors and the households as well as between the subcontractors and material suppliers, that is, resolving the <b>capital</b> <b>shortage</b> by debts or loans.|$|E

The results also show that, optimally, core infrastructure appears to support a variable level of productive investment over time. However, the shortage of productive capital would at least be as important as that of infrastructure capital, suggesting an optimal trade off between the two. That is, the social opportunity cost of investing in either type of capital would be determined by the gap between the optimal growth rates estimated from these two types of capital.

30|$|Turning to {{financial}} infrastructure, over 90 % of firms have a checking and/or savings account in China, the Philippines and the Pacific Islands, while this share reduces to {{about half of}} firms in Indonesia. Countries in which about 50 % or more of firms have a credit line or loan from a financial institution include Mongolia, Samoa, Tonga and Vietnam. This can facilitate investment and longer-term planning and helps mitigate potential shocks in <b>capital</b> <b>shortages</b> and smooth business cycle fluctuations. Well-functioning financial markets can also connect firms to lenders and investors able to finance business ventures and share risks (World Bank 2004; IFC 2012).|$|R
30|$|What is more, {{the social}} time {{mechanism}} developing {{from the social}} time dimension of contracts effectively explains how SMEs are able to develop rapidly when facing <b>capital</b> <b>shortages.</b> From the perspective of social time, the previously deferred payment developed into the time difference caused by two kinds of capital settlement periods, demonstrating that the production chain based on social relations and market power can provide a financing channel with low costs for the SMEs. In fact, it is through graduated debts and cost allocation {{on the basis of}} the social time mechanism that SMEs are able to realize capital accumulation that cannot be reached in unfamiliar market transaction relations.|$|R
40|$|Human {{capital is}} {{transferable}} across occupations, {{but only to}} a limited extent because of differences in occupational skill-profiles.

We propose characterizing occupational switches {{in terms of human}} <b>capital</b> <b>shortages</b> and redundancies. This results in superior predictions of individual wages and occupational switches.

40|$|Massive {{federal budget}} deficits and declining {{personal}} saving flows portend an acute private-sector <b>capital</b> <b>shortage</b> over {{the balance of}} the 1980 s decade. Housing is the sector of the economy most likely to bear the brunt of this shortage. Quantifying that shortage and suggesting preventive policy changes are the primary purposes of his paper. The recent, conservative estimates of household formations and housing production requirements of the MIT-Harvard Joint Center for Urban Studies form the basis for estimates of the net capital requirements for homing during 1984 through 1989. These estimates are compared with estimates of net capital supply for housing to reveal a <b>capital</b> <b>shortage</b> that will preclude the achievement of the housing production requirements without further change in economic policy.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{contrary}} to several empirical contributions we report {{a positive and}} significant influence of schooling investment on the long run growth of the Italian regions in the period 1963 - 1995. This result is obtained when {{the unemployment rate is}} added as an additional controlling dimension. In the theoretical part of the paper we propose a growth model that could account for these empirical results. The model is built on the idea that the accumulation of human capital is a learning-by-doing process where scholastic knowledge must be combined with working experience. The dynamic steady state of the model implies a negative relationship between long run growth and equilibrium unemployment rate. The transitional dynamics of the model implies an asymmetric convergence path. Economies starting with a relative human <b>capital</b> <b>shortage</b> converge at a slower speed toward the steady state growth than economies starting with a relative physical <b>capital</b> <b>shortage.</b> The dynamics of the model appears to be coherent with the basic stylized facts characterizing the Italian regional development...|$|E
40|$|This year I {{have been}} on leave from the Uni-versity {{stationed}} at the National Association of Food Chains in Washington. I {{have been able to}} view the industry close-up for the last twelve months and am very anxious to share my observa-tions with you. Since my comparative advantage lies in retailing, my remarks will be directed specifi-cally to that sector. Five basic economic trends underlie our discus-sion. First, the decline in rate of domestic popula-tion growth. This phenomenon caught everyone, including food retailers, off guard. As a result, new store construction has outstripped demand over at least the last five years. Average sales per square foot of selling space deflated by the food-at-home portion of the consumer price index were 3. 57 in 1972, 3. 33 in 1973, 3. 13 in 1974 and 3. 03 in 1975 (S. M. I.). Overcapacity is a fact in this industry. Second, the energy crisis. No other industry in the United States is more concerned about the impending energy shortage and no food retailer believes the crisis has gone away. Programs developed in response to the problem have already started {{to have an impact on}} industry structure. More about this later. Third, the capital crisis. Almost every serious industry analyst predicts a serious <b>capital</b> <b>shortage</b> for food retailers over the next ten to fifteen years (McKinsey). Our economy in general will experience a <b>capital</b> <b>shortage</b> over this period due primarily to new expenditures needed to finance higher energy costs, new environmental protection programs, and new safety standards.

30|$|The {{dimension}} of the countervailing mechanism obeying a distinct logic {{is different from the}} debts shown in Fig.  4. Specifically, the countervailing mechanism was not intended to repay material suppliers and the upstream households in advance but to build a new mutual debt mechanism between the subcontractors and the households or the subcontractors and the material suppliers on the premise of keeping the original capital settlement period based on social time. It is distinguished from debt relations with subcontractors in which the material suppliers and the households had to pay some costs for their debts. The costs were caused by the market-dominant position of the subcontractors within the production and management frame. For example, in Pu Town there were some subcontractors lending money to households to purchase looms when these households faced <b>capital</b> <b>shortages</b> due to the expansion of scale or economic hardship and deducting the debts from the processing charges. The reverse debt relations were based on the cooperative relations between the subcontractors and the households. Additionally, capital settlement between them was also based on social time.|$|R
