50|$|The NTC faced one of {{its first}} {{diplomatic}} quandaries after Iman al-Obeidi, a Libyan woman who accused Gaddafi-loyal militiamen of beating and gang-raping her at a checkpoint in a high-profile appearance before journalists at the Rixos Al Nasr in Tripoli, was granted asylum in Qatar. Despite the protests of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Qatar then forcibly deported Obeidi back to Benghazi on 2 June 2011 for unknown reasons, and Obeidi publicly blamed the NTC for her deportation. Despite this incident, Qatari cooperation with the NTC remained close throughout the war, with <b>close</b> <b>consultations</b> between officials of the two governments in Doha becoming so frequent that some anti-Gaddafi fighters complained that their leadership was {{spending too much time}} in Qatar and not enough time in Libya.

50|$|In early 2003, a {{few weeks}} after his {{retirement}} from the army and arrival to the NSC, Eiland became aware of Sharon's disengagement initiative - at that stage the initiative had more limited objectives in the Gaza Strip and broader in the West Bank. Eiland agreed that a political initiative was needed, but objected to both the content of Sharon's proposal and the procedure for preparing and presenting it. In 2004 Eiland took part in drawing up the disengagement plan in <b>close</b> <b>consultations</b> with US Advisors among them National Security Council Middle East Advisor Elliott Abrams. Eiland shuttled with Ariel Sharon's Chief of Staff, between Washington and Jerusalem to hammer up successive drafts. It was Eiland's initiative to establish a Disengagement Authority and to set a realistic schedule program. The plan, as adopted by the Israeli Government and the Knesset, is largely a result of Eiland's formulation. During the year 2005 there were reports in the media about Eiland's criticism of the policy and the national security decision-making process. After the implementation of the disengagement plan had been concluded, Eiland informed the Prime Minister that he had exhausted his ability to influence the process and he decided to resign from the NSC.|$|E
40|$|Environmental social {{controls}} (ESCs) such as mandatory disclosure, regulations, subsidies, and stakeholder opinion {{are intended}} to improve firm environmental performance. This paper reports ESC importance to Australian financial managers in making capital investment decisions. A decision-making experiment showed managers to be most responsive to stakeholder opinion (42 per cent), followed by subsidization (26 per cent) and regulatory cost (22 per cent). Mandatory disclosure has very little influence (10 per cent). ESC interaction effects are limited so coordination of ESC policy is not a primary concern. High degrees of managerial self-insight suggest policy changes would be enhanced by <b>close</b> <b>consultations</b> with the managers involved. 19 page(s...|$|E
