This case study presents a simple approach of developing a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to reduce the variation in moisture in Coke by analyzing past data and using Cause and Effect diagram and critically analyzing the contribution of different factors in introducing variation in moisture. The pre and post SOP implementation results are analyzed statistically to ensure that the difference in variance of moisture content is statistically significant.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the management of wood waste generated after demolition of a typical 33 year old <b>coke</b> <b>quenching</b> tower from an integrated steelworks. Wood in the <b>coke</b> <b>quenching</b> tower was treated with traditional waterborne preservative, Copper-Chromium-Arsenic (CCA). Due to the growing environmental concern, changes were introduced in the legislation governing the disposal of waste. Hence, the aim of the thesis was to perform a waste management study by investigating CCA treated wood waste and to develop a waste disposal technique. During the characterisation of the wood waste, elemental analysis was performed to confirm CCA concentration remaining in the treated wood waste. Concentration of CCA elements ranged from 300 mg/kg to 10, 000 mg/kg. The concentration reduced with increase in the years of service life of the treated wood. Leaching tests according to British Standards were performed for different durations from 1 hour to 1 month to determine the leaching behaviour exhibited by the wood. Standard and customised sampling procedures were carried out for leaching tests to study and simulate the loss of CCA from the treated wood during a quenching process. These tests provided a leaching pattern that the loss of CCA follows a trend of As > Cu > Cr which was in agreement with the final concentrations of the quenching tower wood, such that chromium was most resistant to leaching and arsenic was most susceptible to leach. Correlations and linear equations were established between the arsenic-chromium and arsenic-copper leach concentrations. Equations were developed to help in predicting the ratio of leach ability of the CCA elements with respect to each other. It was also found that the wood from the tower contained a substantial amount of iron which was further investigated. The growth ring analysis showed that iron was mainly deposited on the wood surface. The prime sources of iron were identified to be kish, an air borne particulate matter found in steelworks environment as well as coke and coke ash. Leaching studies performed to determine the leachability of iron showed that there was a potential for iron to restrict the mobility of CCA elements in soil. A novel three-step chemical extraction method was developed after analysing the sequential analysis performed with different chemical reagents and leaching behaviour of the CCA wood waste. Step one used sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to break down the wood structure by lignin depolymerisation. The use of NaOH provided alkaline conditions and facilitated the process of lignin depolymerisation mainly to release arsenic as water soluble compounds. This was followed by ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) for release of copper, due to the high affinity of ammonium group to form complexes with copper. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) was used as a strong oxidising agent and primarily to release the chromium by forming chromium complexes which are readily soluble in water. The effect of the pH, temperature, concentration and order of the reagent to be used were studied. Therefore, CCA wood was subjected to the three-step process, where the order was designed as NaOH followed by NH 4 Cl and then H 2 O 2 for 1 hour at 100 oC with 1 M, 2 M and 2 M concentration respectively. 98...|$|E

40|$|We try to {{understand}} the role of technological change and diffusion of energy efficient technologies in order to explain the trend of energy intensity developments in the German steel industry. We selected six key energy efficient technologies and collected data to derive their diffusion since their introduction in Germany. Since all technologies have been applied in Germany for more than 30 years we would expect complete diffusion. We found complete diffusion only for basic oxygen furnaces and continuous casting. Newer technologies (i. e. basic oxygen furnace gas recovery, top pressure recovery turbine, <b>coke</b> dry <b>quenching</b> and pulverized coal injection) diffused quicker in the initial phase but then diffusion slowed down. Key improvements in energy efficiency are due to electric arc furnaces (24 %), basic oxygen furnaces (12 %), and continuous casting (6 %) between 1958 and 2012. The contribution of top pressure recovery turbines, pulverized coal injection and basic oxygen furnaces gas recovery accounts in total of about 3 %. If the selected technologies were diffused completely, the future energy consumption could be reduced by 4. 5 % compared to 2012. Our findings suggest that our selection of six technologies is the key driver for energy intensity developments within the German steel industry between 1958 and 2012. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|CO 2 {{mitigation}} {{strategies in}} industrial parks {{are a significant}} component of the Chinese climate change mitigation policy, and industrial symbiosis can provide specific CO 2 mitigation opportunity. Technology is important to support symbiosis, but few studies in China have focused on this topic at the industrial park level. This research presented {{a case study in}} a national iron and steel industrial park in China. Focus was given onto carbon mitigation through industrial symbiosis technology using substance flow analysis (SFA). Three typical iron and steel industry technologies, including <b>coke</b> dry <b>quenching</b> (CDQ), combined cycle power plant (CCPP), and CO 2 capture by slag carbonization (CCSC) were evaluated with SFA. Technology assessment was further conducted in terms of carbon mitigation potential and unit reduction cost. Compared with the Business as usual (BAU) scenario, application with CDQ, CCPP, and CCSC reduced the net carbon emissions by 56. 18, 134. 43, and 222. 89 kg CO 2 per ton crude steel inside the industrial parks, respectively, including both direct and indirect emissions. Economic assessment revealed that the unit costs for the three technologies were also high, thereby necessitating national financial support.

50|$|Fuel and Steel: Pine {{charcoal}} is cut to {{size for}} use in the fire as gentle heat for the blade before <b>quench.</b> <b>Coke</b> is the most common fuel to forge the blade to shape and is preheated to remove remaining sulfur and phosphorus. Gas is cheaper and may also be used but may yield lower quality, whereas pine charcoal may yield higher quality but it is more expensive. An electric fan is used or a box bellow to feed air into the forge. The steel is usually one of the carbon knife steels Hitachi produces at Yasugi Specialty Steel. These are the unalloyed White steel (1, 2, 3) and the tungsten and chromium alloyed Blue steel (1, 2, Super), with White 2 the most common and Blue 2 the next most produced. Less common is White 1 and White 3 and rarely used is Blue Super used (because it is much harder to forge due the resiliency to stretching from the alloying), and even less common is tamahagane (as the steel is expensive, much more difficult to process, and must be correctly forge welded and flattened).|$|R
40|$|Coke plants, {{which produce}} {{various types of}} coke (metallurgical, foundry or heating), at {{temperatures}} between 600 and 1200 °C, with limited access to oxygen, are major emitters of particulates and gaseous pollutants to air, water and soils. Primarily, the process of wet quenching should be mentioned, {{as one of the}} most cumbersome. Atmospheric pollutants include particulates, tar substances, organic pollutants including B(a) P and many others. Pollutants are also formed from the decomposition of water used to <b>quench</b> <b>coke</b> (CO, phenol, HCN, H 2 S, NH 3, cresol) and decomposition of hot coke in the first phase of quenching (CO, H 2 S, SO 2) [1]. The development of the coke oven technology has resulted in the changes made to different types of technological installations, such as the use of baffles in quench towers, the removal of nitrogen oxides by selective NOx reduction, and the introduction of fabric filters for particulates removal. The BAT conclusions for coke plants [2] provide a methodology for the measurement of particulate emission from a wet, low-emission technology using Mohrhauer probes. The conclusions define the emission level for wet quenching process as 25 g/Mgcoke. The conducted research was aimed at verification of the presented method. For two of three quench towers (A and C) the requirements included in the BAT conclusions are not met and emissions amount to 87. 34 and 61. 35 g/Mgcoke respectively.

40|$|Abstract Liquid iron in the {{ironmaking}} {{blast furnace}} picks {{up more than}} half of its carbon while percolating through the packed coke bed in the deadman and hearth of the blast furnace thus the conditions within the hearth have a direct impact on liquid drainage and hot metal quality. Consequently, the rate of carbon dissolution into liquid iron, and the factors contributing to the movement of liquids through the coke bed must be understood. Investigations using <b>quenched</b> <b>coke</b> dissolution techniques have demonstrated that a mineral layer was formed between the liquid iron and the coke matrix as coke dissolves into iron under conditions comparable to the lower zone of the blast furnace hearth. This layer was predominantly comprised of calcium aluminates and was observed to change both its composition and morphology with time and temperature. Based on these findings, and plant based observations of the Port Kembla blast furnaces, important phenomena such has hearth coke bed state (floating vs sitting) are able to be discussed in terms of a cleaning/fouling cycle contributed to by the formation of different calcium aluminates in the deadman, in turn influenced by the coke ash chemistry. Supporting arguments for each stage of the cycle are drawn from the fundamental research, plant based observation and detailed analysis of specific blast furnace events. Application of this knowledge to Port Kembla blast furnace operations has allowed identification of periods where there is elevated risk of compromised hearth conditions. Further work in this area is expected to identify techniques that will allow a floating deadman to be secured improving furnace stability, iron quality and reducing hearth wear...|$|R
40|$|Fundamental {{understanding}} of coke reactions with gas, metal and slag phases {{is essential for}} ensuring smooth operation and optimisation of coke performance in existing and advanced blast furnace process, and is dictated by coke properties and blast furnace process conditions. In this study, coke samples excavated from LKAB's Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) at MEFOS in Luleå, Sweden were collected. The centreline <b>quenched</b> <b>coke</b> samples from different zones of this EBF were used to observe the influence of in-furnace reactions {{on the evolution of}} coke properties and their associations with CO 2 reactivity. Carbon structure of coke was found to increasingly ordered, silicon and iron concentration in the coke samples decreased, while alkali concentration particularly potassium and sodium were found to increase as the coke descended towards lower part of the EBF. Both isothermal and non-isothermal reactivity based on TGA measurements showed that coke reactivity towards CO 2 is increased as coke descends towards cohesive zone despite increasing order of carbon structures. Increased reactivity of cokes at lower parts of EBF was related to alkali enrichments of cokes. The study further shows that increased alkali components in cokes have a strong impact on CO 2 gasification in EBF such that influence of coke graphitisation could be compensated by catalytic influence of alkalis. To further assist with development of {{understanding of}} reactivity of coke, gasification studies were also conducted in a fixed bed reactor at 900 ºC using a series of cokes made from Australian coals (varying in rank, maceral and mineral matter). The CO 2 reactivity of cokes in a fixed bed reactor was also found to be strongly influenced by the coke minerals compared to carbon structure. Further studies are required to provide a critical insight into the influence of key parameters such as coke graphitisation and mineral reactions on coke gasification particularly at higher temperatures.

40|$|This work follows on {{from two}} papers which {{presented}} a hypothesis for the mechanism behind oven wall pressure. It was proposed that oven wall pressure results when {{the period of}} pore growth is lengthy prior to coalescence and/or the period of coalescence is minor ahead of resolidification. When this occurs a thick swollen band of closed pores in the viscoelastic medium results which exerts pressure on the oven walls. The band is a resistance to volatile transfer and the largely closed pore network remains throughout resolidification further exacerbating pressure on oven walls. This hypothesis has resulted from a mapping of the viscoelastic properties obtained from a rheometer against the plate behaviour of the rheometer where pore nucleation and growth has been characterised {{by an increase in}} plate gap (ΔL) when the plate is held under constant axial force (AF) or an increase AF when the plates are held at constant gap. Pore coalescence has been characterised by a peak in AF or a decrease in the rate of expansion of ΔL. Because the behaviour of either ΔL or AF has brought about our understanding of coking pressure this paper attempts to prove that pore coalescence can be monitored from plate behaviour. As such this paper attempts to track pore growth and coalescence using mercury porosimetry, permeability, scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy, all of which have been carried out on <b>quenched</b> <b>coke</b> samples. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the ΔL profile provides an accurate account of the onset of bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence. Porosity measurements indicate that the proportion of open pores in the 1 - 100 μm range increases significantly after the peak in AF or decrease in the rate of expansion of ΔL, indicating that these points coincide with a bubble coalescence phenomena. Optical microscopy showed a distinct difference in pore structure between the image corresponding to the peak in axial force and images after, whereby the number of isolated cells decreased and pore walls became thinner. Permeability measurements on quenched samples throughout the softening process show an initial drop in permeability due to the loss of interparticle voidage and the onset of swelling followed by a steady increase coinciding with the peak in axial force and decrease in the rate of ΔL expansion. This work has helped to reinforce the proposed mechanism for coking pressure. Furthermore, permeability measurements of quenched samples at 550 °C show that the high pressure coals tend to have the lower permeabilities at this temperature. The finding that pore growth and coalescence behaviour is what impacts on coking pressure has opened the door for finding novel ways to manipulate pore behaviour and therefore manipulate coking pressure. Understanding and manipulating pore growth behaviour has other implications, largely the understanding for coke strength development, which is currently being explored by the authors...|$|R
