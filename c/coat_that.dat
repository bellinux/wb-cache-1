5|$|The Pug is a {{breed of}} dog with {{physically}} distinctive {{features of a}} wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> comes {{in a variety of}} colours, most often fawn or black, and a compact square body with well-developed muscles.|$|E
5|$|Galloways have a thick {{double-layered}} <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> is wavy or curly. This thick coat of hair insulates {{their bodies}} {{so well that}} they have a minimal outer layer of fat on their bodies, which would otherwise create waste at slaughter. This coat sheds out in the summer months and in warmer climates. Despite the animal's usual use in beef production, there is evidence of Galloway herds being milked in Cumberland for cheese production.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{unless a}} new bishop {{has a family}} coat of arms, he {{typically}} adopts within his shield symbols that indicate his interests or past service. Devotion to a particular saint is represented by symbols established in iconography and heraldic tradition. In the Church of England, new bishops typically choose a <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> looks entirely non-clerical, not least because their descendants may seek reassignment of the arms, and few of them {{are likely to be}} clerics.|$|E
50|$|The {{polycarbonate}} {{usually has}} one of two types of coating to resist abrasion: a soft <b>coating</b> <b>that</b> heals after being scratched (such as elastomeric carbon-based polymers) or a hard <b>coating</b> <b>that</b> prevents scratching (such as silicon-based polymers).|$|R

5|$|Poliovirus is {{composed}} of an RNA genome and a protein capsid. The genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is about 7500 nucleotides long. The viral particle is about 30 nm in diameter with icosahedral symmetry. Because of its short genome and its simple composition—only RNA and a nonenveloped icosahedral protein <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> encapsulates it, poliovirus {{is widely regarded as}} the simplest significant virus.|$|E
5|$|They have dense coarse <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> protects {{them from}} the weather and from vermin. Giant Schnauzers come in two color patterns: Solid black, and a color known as pepper and salt, with banded hairs of {{alternating}} white and black, appearing gray hairs at a distance. Where legal, they are shown with cropped ears and docked tails. Like other schnauzers, they have a distinct beard and eyebrows. Today, the Giant Schnauzer participates in numerous dog sports, including Schutzhund. It is also used as a police dog.|$|E
5|$|In {{another of}} her studies, Morgan worked with a fox breeder to {{study the effects of}} diets that {{contained}} low and normal amounts of B vitamins. The experimental group (the vitamin-restricted foxes) developed a fine, sparse gray <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> resembled the fashionable fur of the silver fox. Morgan found that the foxes with normal intake of B vitamins had shiny black fur. After the experiments, a fur stole was made out of fur from both the experimental and control groups. Morgan wore the stole on at least two important occasions – her presentation of the study data in 1939 and her Garvan Medal award ceremony ten years later.|$|E

5|$|On 19 February 1917, in {{a tribute}} {{from his native}} city, Ball became an Honorary Freeman of Nottingham. Around this time he met James McCudden, also on leave, who later {{reported}} his impressions in most favourable terms. In London, Ball also encountered Canadian pilot Billy Bishop, who had not as yet seen combat. He immediately liked Bishop, and may have helped the latter secure a posting to No.60 Squadron. On 25 March, while off-duty, Ball met 18-year-old Flora Young. He impulsively invited her to fly with him, and she promptly accepted, wearing a leather flying <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> they had borrowed. On 5 April, they became engaged; she wore his silver identification wrist bracelet in lieu of an engagement ring.|$|E
5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{developed}} in France {{for use as}} a gundog. It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds. It is thought {{to be one of the}} two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain. However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century. Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections.|$|E
5|$|Continuing their charge after McCausland's Brigade, the Union cavalry charged {{into the}} camp of the 16th Virginia Cavalry, which fled without resisting. Conger's 3rd West Virginia turned eastward and pursued rebels fleeing east {{down the road}} to Wardensville and Winchester. The 17th Virginia Cavalry was camped near some woods east of the main road, and had more time to prepare for the attack. They formed a battle line while three {{companies}} waited behind a fence. Initially, they repulsed Conger's men, forcing them to retreat. However, Conger was soon reinforced by Colonel Powell and the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, which was commanded by Colonel Henry Capehart. The two regiments charged the Virginians and drove them down the road or into the woods. During this time, Conger was killed by a lieutenant from the 17th Virginia. The Virginian was wearing a blue <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> fooled Conger into thinking he was from Conger's regiment. The two West Virginia regiments continued to pursue the Confederates down the road, and captured McCausland's two pieces of artillery. Eventually, some of the fleeing rebels ran into Major Work's 22nd Pennsylvania, and had to scatter to the woods. Work's men captured 34 of them.|$|E

25|$|The Golden Retriever is a large-sized {{breed of}} dog bred as gun dogs to {{retrieve}} shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland game birds during hunting and shooting parties, and were named 'retriever' {{because of their}} ability to retrieve shot game undamaged. Golden Retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> lies flat against their bodies and repels water. Golden Retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments. Although they need substantial outdoor exercise, they should be housed in a fenced area because of their instinctual tendency to roam. They shed copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and require fairly regular grooming.|$|E
25|$|Huskies are {{energetic}} and athletic. They {{usually have a}} thick double <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> can be gray, black, copper red, or white. Their eyes are typically pale blue, although {{they may also be}} brown, green, blue, yellow, or heterochromic. Huskies are more prone to some degree of uveitis than most other breeds.|$|E

25|$|Wool {{comes from}} domesticated sheep. It forms two products, woolens and worsteds. The sheep has two sorts of wool {{and it is}} the inner <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> is used. This can be mixed with wool that has been {{recovered}} from rags. Shoddy is the term for recovered wool that is not matted, while mungo comes from felted wool. Extract is recovered chemically from mixed cotton/wool fabrics.|$|E

She met {{the head of an}} official inquiry into city government corruption (launched in the wake of Crater's disappearance) and offered to testify about graft. She was murdered five days later. Detectives searching her apartment found a <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> had belonged to Crater.|$|E
25|$|PWDs have a single-layered <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> {{does not}} shed (see Moult), and {{therefore}} their presence is tolerated well among {{many people who}} suffer from dog allergies. Some call PWDs hypoallergenic dogs, but any person with dog allergies who would like a dog with these qualities should actually spend time with the animals before purchasing, to test whether the dog is truly non-allergenic to them.|$|E

25|$|Seeds of {{many plants}} have evolved {{a variety of}} {{defenses}} to deter predation from seed predators. Plants may allocate resources toward physical or chemical defenses. Seeds are often contained inside protective structures or fruit pulp that encapsulate seeds until they are ripe. Other physical defenses include spines, hairs, fibrous seed coats and hard endosperm. Seeds, especially in arid areas, may have a mucilaginous seed <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> can glue soil to seed hiding it from granivores.|$|E

The Professor {{carries a}} flask of explosives in his <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> can be detonated within twenty seconds of him squeezing an india rubber ball in his pocket. The police know this {{and keep their}} distance. The most nihilistic member of the anarchists, the Professor feels oppressed and disgusted {{by the rest of}} humanity and has particular contempt for the weak. He dreams of a world where the weak are freely exterminated so that the strong can thrive. He supplies to Mr Verloc the bomb that kills Stevie.|$|E
25|$|T. b. rhodesiense is {{the acute}} {{form of the}} disease and death can occur within months since the {{symptoms}} emerge within weeks and it is more virulent and faster developing than T. b. gambiense. Furthermore, trypanosomes are surrounded by a <b>coat</b> <b>that</b> is composed of variant surface glycoproteins (VSG). These proteins act to protect the parasite from any lytic factors that are present in human plasma. The host's immune system recognizes the glycoproteins present on the coat of the parasite leading to the production of different antibodies (IgM and IgG).|$|E
