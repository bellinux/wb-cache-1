5000|$|The {{accounting}} profession recognizes leases {{as either}} an operating lease or a <b>capital</b> <b>lease</b> (finance lease). An operating lease records no asset or liability {{on the financial}} statements, the amount paid is expensed as incurred. On the other hand, a <b>capital</b> <b>lease</b> is recorded as both an asset and a liability on the financial statements, generally at {{the present value of}} the rental payments (but never greater than the asset's fair market value). To distinguish the two, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) provided criteria for when a lease should be capitalized, and if any one of the criteria for capitalization is met, the lease is treated as a <b>capital</b> <b>lease</b> and recorded on the financial statements. The primary standard for lease accounting is Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 (FAS 13), which has been amended several times; it is known as topic 840 in the FASB's new Accounting Standards Codification. The basic criteria for capitalization of a lease by lessee are as follows: ...|$|E

50|$|Under a <b>capital</b> <b>lease,</b> the lessor credits owned {{assets and}} debits a lease {{receivable}} {{account for the}} present value of the rents (an asset, which is broken out between current and long-term, the latter being {{the present value of}} rents due more than 12 months in the future). With each payment, cash is debited, the receivable is credited, and unearned (interest) income is credited. If the cost or carrying amount of the asset being leased is different from its fair value at inception, then the difference is recognized as a profit and the lease is called a sales-type lease. This most commonly applies when a manufacturer is using leasing as a method of selling its product. Other capital lessor leases, where the cost and fair value are the same, are called direct financing leases. A third type of lessor <b>capital</b> <b>lease,</b> called a leveraged lease, is used to recognize leases where the acquisition of the leased asset is substantially financed by debt.|$|E

5000|$|The Preliminary Views {{and first}} Exposure Draft called for {{eliminating}} the FAS 13 test which classifies leases as operating <b>leases</b> or <b>capital</b> <b>leases,</b> and treating all leases similarly to current <b>capital</b> <b>leases.</b> All leases would {{be accounted for}} as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet - on the asset side as [...] "right-of-use assets" [...] and on the liability side as lease liabilities; on the income statement, depreciation and interest expense would be recognized instead of rent expense. One implication {{of this is that}} expenses are [...] "front loaded," [...] because interest expense is higher {{in the early part of}} the lease term while the liability is higher. Following substantial protests from both financial statements preparers and users, the second Exposure Draft reinstated two types of lease accounting, with [...] "Type A" [...] leases treated essentially the same as FAS 13 <b>capital</b> <b>leases</b> and [...] "Type B" [...] leases maintaining the single lease expense, straight line over the life of the lease, that characterizes FAS 13 operating leases, but with an asset and liability on the balance sheet. The liability would be the present value of the remaining rents; the asset would be the same as the liability for simple leases, but then adjusted for scheduled changes in rents (which under FAS 13 result in a deferred rent liability or asset) and amortization of initial direct costs and lease incentives. Effective with the second Exposure Draft, the new standard has been given the new Accounting Standards Codification topic number 842 (the topic number for leases was previously 840).|$|R

50|$|If any of {{the above}} are met, the lease would be {{considered}} a capital or financing lease and must be disclosed on the lessee's balance sheet. Conversely, if none of the criteria are met, the contract is an operating lease, and the lessee will have a footnote in its balance sheet to that effect. Both parties (lessor and lessee) must review these criteria at the outset and determine independently the classification as it is possible to classify them differently (it is quite common, in fact, for a single lease to be considered a <b>capital</b> <b>lease</b> by lessors and an operating lease by lessees).|$|E

40|$|While leases {{are widely}} used to finance {{productive}} assets in the U. S, lease accounting has been sharply criticized for providing incomplete and unreliable information to investors because many leases are arranged off-balance sheet as operating leases. As such, a higher cost of equity capital may be required by investors to compensate for unrecorded liabilities and imperfect information. In this dissertation, I provide the empirical evidence as to how equity market participants perceive the off-balance sheet leases. ^ First, I investigate the firm characteristics that determine the choice on operating versus <b>capital</b> <b>leases.</b> By summarizing the results from prior literature, I identify the determinants from three areas: operating risks, financial constraints and tax-driven incentives. The results suggest that both economic and opportunistic reasons drive a firm 2 ̆ 7 s lease choice. Specifically, fast-growing, financially constrained, or low-tax firms opt for off-balance sheet operating leases. ^ Second, I {{examine the impact of}} off-balance sheet operating leases on the cost of equity, and whether it would be different from that of <b>capital</b> <b>leases</b> or conventional debt. The results suggest that off-balance sheet operating leases are “value relevant” as indicated by an increased cost of equity capital being associated with greater use of operating leases. However, investors also seem to suffer from the off-balance sheet position of disclosed operating leases. The leverage effect of operating leases is largely attenuated relative to <b>capital</b> <b>leases</b> and conventional debt. ^ Third, I explore the role of information intermediaries in compensation for the deficiency in accounting for leases. The results indicate that the cost of equity, with respect to the use of off-balance sheet leases, diminishes in greater analyst followings and the existence of credit ratings. Specifically, the diminishing effect of 2 ̆ 7 financial analysts is more pronounced on off-balance sheet operating leases than that on <b>capital</b> <b>leases</b> and conventional debt. Lastly, whether a firm is audited by a big 4 / 5 / 6 / 8 firm appears to have no effect on either off- or on-balance sheet leases. ^ This study contributes to the Financial Accounting Standard Board 2 ̆ 7 s lease accounting project and helps investors assess the risk of firms with off-balance sheet leases. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{determination}} {{of whether a}} lease is a finance (also called <b>capital)</b> <b>lease</b> or an operating lease is defined in the United States by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 (FAS 13). In countries covered by International Financial Reporting Standards, the tests are defined in IAS 17. In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) announced the commencement of a joint project to comprehensively reconsider lease accounting. In July 2008, the boards decided to defer any changes to lessor accounting, while continuing with the project for lessee accounting, with the stated intention to recognise an asset and liability for all lessee leases (in essence, eliminating operating lease accounting). The projected completion of the project is now 2014. As of the second Exposure Draft in 2013, the boards are considering retaining the single, straight-line lease expense profile of operating lease accounting, though assets and liabilities would still be reported.|$|E

40|$|Abstract RESEARH OBJECTIVES The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the value relevance of constructively capitalized operating leases. Currently, leases are classified either operating <b>leases</b> or <b>capital</b> <b>leases.</b> Unlike <b>capital</b> <b>leases,</b> operating leases are reported as rental expense and omitted from balance sheet. Information of operating lease commitments is disclosed in footnotes. Operating leases represent one of the largest source of off-balance sheet financing. There has been a concern among standard setters for a long time, whether the current accounting practice offers reliable representation of leasing transactions that companies are engaged into for financial statement users. This study aims to examine, if the operating lease commitments are reflected in the share prices, i. e. if the market perceives the operating lease information correctly, even though reported off-balance sheet. DATA AND METHODOLOGY The data used in this study is obtained from Compustat. The data is from years 1993 - 2013 and comprises observations of listed companies on air transportation industry, totaling to 850 observations. The study is conducted using OLS regression analysis, by estimating three different models. FINDINGS The study fails to find incremental information content for constructively capitalized operating leases, beyond that contained in reported assets, liabilities and sales.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{prominent}} accounting scandals of the past several years, investors and standard setters are demanding increased corporate transparency. Nowhere is the demand for transparency more salient than with off-balance-sheet financing, of which lease accounting plays a major role. At the end of 2004, total rental commitments by U. S. firms from off-balance-sheet operating leases exceeded $ 1 trillion. As standard setters reconsider leases as part of their broad reexamination of off-balance-sheet financing, they do so without the benefit of empirical research documenting whether capital market participants find the current leasing standard value relevant. This paper examines whether as-if capitalized operating lease liabilities and <b>capital</b> <b>lease</b> liabilities are both relevant and sufficiently reliable to be priced and explores whether equity investors value operating and capital leases differently. The results are consistent with the market viewing both operating and capital leases as economic liabilities of the firm. However, the results also indicate that capital market participants price operating and <b>capital</b> <b>lease</b> liabilities differently, consistent with the bright-line tests of the current leasing standard identifying economic differences in operating and capital leases. Thus, continuing to require lease disclosures by different lease classifications would assure that equity investors will not suffer from a loss of value relevant information in the pricing of leases.
