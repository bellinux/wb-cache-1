5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (<b>caudal)</b> <b>vertebra</b> and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were once thought to fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} dromaeosaurid {{body plan}} helped to rekindle theories {{that at least}} some dinosaurs may have been active, fast, and closely related to birds. Robert Bakker's illustration for John Ostrom's 1969 monograph, showing the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus in a fast run, is among the most influential paleontological reconstructions in history. The dromaeosaurid body plan includes a relatively large skull, serrated teeth, narrow snout, and forward-facing eyes which indicate some degree of binocular vision. Dromaeosaurids, like most other theropods, had a moderately long S-curved neck, and their trunk was relatively short and deep. Like other maniraptorans, they had long arms that could be folded against the body in some species, and relatively large hands with three long fingers (the middle finger being the longest and the first finger being the shortest) ending in large claws. The dromaeosaurid hip structure featured a characteristically large pubic boot projecting beneath the base of the tail. Dromaeosaurid feet bore a large, recurved claw on the second toe. Their tails were slender, with long, low, vertebrae lacking transverse process and neural spines after the 14th <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebra.</b>|$|E
5|$|Currently, both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus are {{classified}} within the Titanosauria, and Jeffrey Wilson stated in 2005 that synonymy cannot be ruled out. Currie and colleagues, in 2003 and 2017, {{argued that a}} synonymy is very probable {{in the light of}} new fossil discoveries in the Nemegt Formation. After relocating the original Nemegtosaurus quarry, these researchers excavated postcranial bones of the Nemegtosaurus holotype including the centrum of a <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebra</b> and hind limb bones, which allowed, for the first time, a direct comparison between the Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia type specimens based on overlapping elements. These postcranial elements were found to be very similar to the corresponding parts of the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype. Most importantly, the discovered caudal centrum is opisthocoelous – a diagnostic feature of Opisthocoelicaudia – suggesting that both genera were either closely related or synonymous. Furthermore, these authors noted that none of the 32 known sauropod localities of the Nemegt Formation revealed evidence for the presence of more than one species of sauropod. In her first description, Borsuk-Białynicka (1977) argued that different sauropod genera sharing the same habitat is nothing unusual, as is evident in the North American Morrison Formation. Currie and colleagues, however, stressed that the dinosaur fauna of the Nemegt Formation was fundamentally different, as larger dinosaurs were present with only few species per clade, indicating a harsh and geographically restricted habitat. Definitive proof for the suggested synonymy is, however, still missing, and additional overlapping elements would be required before Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus can be formally declared synonyms.|$|E
50|$|Gobititan can be {{distinguished}} from other titanosauriformss based on features of the <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> Compared with advanced titanosaurs, where the number of <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> {{had been reduced to}} less than 35, Gobititan had a relatively high number of <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> which was interpreted as a basal trait. Gregory S. Paul estimated that Gobititan was 20 m long and weighed twenty tonnes.|$|R
50|$|Tengrisaurus starkovi {{is based}} on three <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> The genus is {{characterized}} by strongly procoelous anterior and middle <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> with strongly developed pre-epipophyses, highly pneumatic neural spine, and solid bone structure of the centrum.|$|R
5000|$|Gondwanatitan was {{a fairly}} small sauropod, only 7 meters long. It had {{relatively}} gracile limb bones. The middle <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are distinctively [...] "heart-shaped", which allows isolated <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> to be easily distinguished from those of Aeolosaurus.|$|R
5|$|Like {{those of}} other sauropods, the neck {{vertebrae}} are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck. The vertebral formula for the holotype of A.louisae is 15cervicals, 10dorsals, 5sacrals, and 82caudals. The <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebra</b> number may vary, even within species. The cervical vertebrae of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus are stouter and more robust than {{those of other}} diplodocids and {{were found to be}} most similar to Camarasaurus by Charles Whitney Gilmore. In addition, they support cervical ribs that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck, making the neck nearly triangular in cross-section. In Apatosaurus louisae, the atlas-axis complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated. Apatosaurus has ten dorsal ribs {{on either side of the}} body. The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. Apatosaurus, like its close relative Supersaurus, has tall neural spines, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid; it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from the hips. Apatosaurus also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest. As in other diplodocids, the tail transformed into a whip-like structure towards the end.|$|E
25|$|According to D'Emic et al. (2013) Huabeisaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on this set of autapomorphies: the division of some presacral vertebral laminae; posterior cervical vertebrae with a divided prezygodiapophyseal lamina; anterior dorsal vertebrae with a divided anterior spinodiapophyseal lamina; the presence of postzygapophyseal spinodiapophyseal fossa that are larger than postzygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossa on anterior-middle caudal vertebrae; caudal vertebrae with small caudal ribs that disappear around <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebra</b> eight; ventrally one-third of anterior-middle caudal vertebral centra expanded posteriorly; two longitudinal ridges on the lateral faces of mid-caudal vertebral centra; a coracoid with tubercle near anterodorsal edge of lateral face; the distal end of radius about twice as broad transversely as midshaft (convergently acquired in derived titanosaurs); a tubercle on ischial plate that projects from posterior margin; the development of fossae relative {{to one another in}} caudal vertebral neural arches; and a high tibia-to-femur ratio.|$|E
25|$|Vertebrae {{are defined}} by the regions of the {{vertebral}} column that they occur in, as in humans. Cervical vertebrae are those in the neck area. With {{the exception of the}} two sloth genera (Choloepus and Bradypus) and the manatee genus, (Trichechus), all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae. In other vertebrates, the number of cervical vertebrae can range from a single vertebra in amphibians, to as many as 25 in swans or 76 in the extinct plesiosaur Elasmosaurus. The dorsal vertebrae range {{from the bottom of the}} neck to the top of the pelvis. Dorsal vertebrae attached to the ribs are called thoracic vertebrae, while those without ribs are called lumbar vertebrae. The sacral vertebrae are those in the pelvic region, and range from one in amphibians, to two in most birds and modern reptiles, or up to three to five in mammals. When multiple sacral vertebrae are fused into a single structure, it is called the sacrum. The synsacrum is a similar fused structure found in birds that is composed of the sacral, lumbar, and some of the thoracic and <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebra,</b> as well as the pelvic girdle. Caudal vertebrae compose the tail, and the final few can be fused into the pygostyle in birds, or into the coccygeal or tail bone in chimpanzees (and humans).|$|E
50|$|Aeolosaurs, Aeolosaurus in particular, {{have very}} {{distinctive}} <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> The genus Aeolosaurus is diagnosed by the shared presence of down-curved prezygapophyses on its anterior <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> and chevrons from the anterior and middle {{portions of the}} tail with concave posterodorsal surfaces that contain double articular facets. The <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> of Aeolosaurus and the related genus Gondwanatitan share anteriorly-inclined neural spines in the anterior <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> The vertebrae from the middle part of its tail had elongated centra. Aeolosaurus had vertebral lateral fossae that resembled shallow depressions. Fossae that similarly resemble shallow depressions are known from Saltasaurus, Alamosaurus, Malawisaurus, and Gondwanatitan. Its middle tail vertebrae's neural spines angled anteriorly when the vertebrae are aligned. These vertebrae resemble those of Cedarosaurus, Venenosaurus, and Gondwanatitan.|$|R
25|$|The most {{distinguishing}} feature of ankylosaurids {{is the presence}} of a tail club. It is made out of modified interlocking distal <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> and enlarged, bulbous osteoderms. The “handle” of the tail club involves the vertebrae, and requires elongated prezygapophyses to overlap {{at least half of the}} preceding vertebral centrum length. These distal <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> also lack transverse processes and neural spines, and therefore tend to be longer than they are wide; the reverse is true for proximal <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> Derived ankylosaurids possess a fusion of posterior dorsal, sacral, and sometimes anterior <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae,</b> which forms a singular structure called a “synsacrum complex”. There is a complete fusion between centra, neural arches, zygapophyses, and sometimes neural spines.|$|R
5|$|The tail of Dimetrodon {{makes up}} {{a large portion of}} its total body length and {{includes}} around 50 <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> Tails were missing or incomplete in the first described skeletons of Dimetrodon; the only <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> known were the eleven closest to the hip. Since these first few <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> narrow rapidly as they progress farther from the hip, many paleontologists {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries thought that Dimetrodon had a very short tail. It was not until 1927 that a largely complete tail of Dimetrodon was described.|$|R
25|$|Elasmosaurus {{had four}} sacral {{vertebrae}} (the fused vertebrae {{that form the}} sacrum connected to the pelvis), a number typical of elasmosaurids. The transverse processes here were very short, and the rib facets increased in size from the first to the fourth sacral vertebra. A ridge ran {{along the top of}} these vertebrae, and the lower sides of the centra were rounded, and bore pairs of nutritive foramina, separated by low ridges. The first tail (or <b>caudal)</b> <b>vertebra</b> could be distinguished by the preceding sacral vertebra by having smaller rib facets, and by being positioned in {{the lower half of the}} centrum. These vertebrae were almost circular in shape, and the first two bore a narrow keel in the middle of the upper side. The rib facets of the tail vertebrae were located on the lower side of the centra, and their oval shape became larger and broader from the third vertebra and onwards, but became smaller from the 14th vertebra. Here, the pre zygapophyses also reached over the level of the centra for most of their length, while the post zygapophyses reached over this level by half their length. The lower part of the centra were rounded from the first to the third tail vertebrae, but concave from the fourth to the 18th. The usual number of trail vertebrae in elasmosaurids is 30. Since the last tail-vertebrae of elasmosaurids were fused into a structure similar to the pygostyle of birds, it is possible this supported a tail-fin, but the shape it would have had is unknown.|$|E
500|$|FSAC-KK 11888 is {{a partial}} subadult {{skeleton}} {{recovered from the}} Kem Kem beds of North Africa. Described by Ibrahim et al. (2014) and designated as the neotype specimen (although Evers et al. 2015 reject the neotype designation for FSAC-KK-11888). It includes cervical vertebrae, dorsal vertebrae, neural spines, a complete sacrum, femora, tibiae, pedal phalanges, <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebra,</b> several dorsal ribs, and fragments of the skull. The body proportions of this specimen have been debated as the hind limbs are disproportionately shorter in the specimen than in previous reconstructions. However, it has been demonstrated by multiple paleontologists that the specimen is not a chimaera, and is indeed a specimen of Spinosaurus that suggests that the animal had much smaller hind limbs than previously thought ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{vertebral}} column of Euoplocephalus {{is made up}} of at least seven cervical vertebrae, at least eleven [...] "free" [...] dorsal vertebrae, typically four sacrodorsals forming a fused [...] "sacral rod" [...] in front of the sacrum proper, three [...] "true" [...] sacral vertebrae, and between one and four caudosacrals. Like with other ankylosaurians, the last four dorsal vertebrae and the first <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebra</b> are thus fused to the sacrum, forming a reinforced synsacrum of at least eight vertebrae, the spines of which form a fused supraneural plate, also incorporating the zygapophyses. There are at least twenty-one caudal vertebrae; the total number of caudal vertebrae is uncertain because approximately ten are fused to form part of the tail club, bringing the total to about thirty. This fusion is also seen in other ankylosaurids; {{it is possible that the}} extent of fusion is an age-related feature.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probable}} that Xingxiulong would have had more than the 35 preserved <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> in the tail.

The transverse processes of the first several <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> are wide and flat, and directed upwards and outwards; the transverse processes of <b>caudal</b> <b>vertebrae</b> further back in the tail are more slender and horizontal.
