This task {{can be viewed as}} word-sense disambiguation, treating the semantic roles of prepositional phrases as word senses for the associated preposition. Three sets of experiments are done: one evaluates <b>crossfold</b> validation over the TREEBANK role annotations; another does the same for the FRAMENET role annotations; the last evaluates the applicability of lexical associations across datasets. Each set of experiments compares the use of traditional lexical associations (i. e., collocations) versus class-based lexical associations using WordNet synsets. The latter generalize better to handle unknown datasets...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNew {{structural}} data obtained on the Birimian terranes of the Kolia-Boboti sedimentary Basin, {{the eastern part}} of the Diale´ -Dale´ma Supergroup in the Ke´dougou-Ke´ nie´ba inlier show two major phases of Eburnean compressional deformation: (1) a D 1 phase of thrusting tectonics affected the Lower Birimian B 1 tourmalinized sediments. This firsttectonic phase is characterized by isoclinals overturned to recumbent folds P 1 with N 0408208 NE trending axis, associated with axial plane schistosity S 0 S 1 which is mainly transposed in the bedding; (2) a D 2 phase of compressional (D 2 a) and transpressional(D 2 b) tectonics is responsible for the <b>crossfolds</b> P 2 a-P 2 b exhibiting curved axes. These P 2 folds are associated with the major schistosity S 2, north-south to SW-NE trending, mainly dipping to the south-east. The S 2 schistosity is mostly displayed in the large shear zones corridors where it steeply dips locally toward the north-west. A north-west vergence thrusting phase (D 2 c) of flats and ramps, associated with reverse folds, represents the last Eburnean event. This geometrical feature is characteristic of a ''positive flower structure''. These different Eburnean compressional phases are separated by extensional deformation which is characterized by sedimentary deposits and volcanic flows...|$|R
40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. The study area, {{located in the}} eastern succession of the Mt. Isa Inlier, consists of interbedded metamorphosed calcareous, pelitic, quartzose and chert sediments of the Mary Kathleen Group. Two zones with contrasting structural styles and metamorphic grades are present within the study area. An eastern succession of openly <b>crossfolded</b> metasediments and a western tight to isoclinally folded succession intruded by granites of different ages. Metamorphic grade varies between the two areas. Zone 1, to the east contains mineral assemblages typical of the upper Greenschist Facies while to the west in zone 2, the assemblages typify the Almandine Amphibolite Facies. Garnet-biotite and garnet-hornblende geothermometers indicate temperatures of 430 - 480 °C in zone 1 and temperatures of 600 - 650 °C in zone 2. Comparison of the two zones, which have been faulted against one another after regional metamorphism, has helped elucidate changes in mineral chemistry and geochemistry with increasing metamorphic grade. The geochemistry {{of the two major}} units; the older Overhang Jaspilite in zone 1 and the overlying Corella Formation in zone 2, show similarities in major element compositions, particularly Al, Ti and Fe, which are related to the source of sediments. Mg, Na and Ca content is generally higher in the Corella Formation and is related to a more evaporitic environment of deposition. A comparison of dolerites that pervade the study area have been used for the study of changes in mineral chemistry with metamorphic grade, and show changes from tremolite-biotite-albite-epidote assemblages in zone 1 to hornblende-oligoclase/andesine ± garnet assemblages in zone 2. Garnet-biotite schists of similar bulk rock compositions are found within both zones and show trends from low Ti, high Mg/Mg+Fe in biotite and high CaO+MnO in garnets to high Ti, low Mg/Mg+Fe in biotite and high Fe+Mg in garnets with increasing grade.

40|$|The Precambrian {{basement}} {{rocks of}} the Lowder-Mudiah area {{are divided into}} three main belts separated by two northeast-striking ductile shear (thrust) zones. The central belt consists of highly metamorphosed granitic gneisses intruded by granites. The eastern belt comprises greenschist-grade northeast-trending metavolcanics; these rocks are deformed in open antiforms and synforms. The western belt is composed of granite (740 22 Ma), diorite and gabbro traversed by two extensive dyke swarms, forming 75 - 90 % of the total rock volume. The major swarm (709 21 Ma) trends NE-SW and the minor (587 18 Ma) E-W to NW-SE. Three deformational episodes are recognized. Northeast trending recumbent isoclinal folds were followed by open folds with vertical axial planes and northwest trending <b>crossfolds</b> and kink bands. The thrust-lineation relationships suggest {{that there was an}} early phase of thrusting which produced down-dip lineations, and that these thrust surfaces were later reactivated to become dextral trans current ductile shear zones which gave rise to the present predominant shallow-plunging lineations. Tertiary block faulting occurred along reactivated Precambrian thrust planes. Peraluminous, high silica, "A-type" granites formed from LILE-and LREE-enriched crustal melts in an extensional tectonic regime. These granitoids are similar to the felsic Mudiah metavolcanics, the felsic Mukeras dyke swarm and the "A-type" young granitoids (686 - 517 Ma) of Central Hijaz, Saudi Arabia. The Mudiah metavolcanics and the NE-SW Mukeras dyke swarm are bimodal formed from LILE- and LREE-enriched source(s), and they exhibit Andean-type convergent margin characteristics. However, a large degree of compositional overlap may be expected between lavas in highly magmatic, rapidly distending rifts, and Andean-type convergent margins. Moreover, the Mudiah metavolcanics and the Mukeras dyke swarms are chemically similar to the dyke swarms in the Northeastern Desert of Egypt and the "sequence" A volcanics of Central Arabian Shield. It is concluded that the late Precambrian accretion of arc systems resulted in a thickening of the crust, which led to deep crustal melting, which was probably triggered by upper mantle diapirism, caused by adiabatic decompression, updoming, stretching and crustal thinning and the injection of mantle-derived basaltic magma, that gave rise to the basaltic Mudiah metavolcanics and the basaltic Mukeras dyke swarms. In contrast, crustal melts' are represented by the Lowder-Mudiah "A-type" granitoids, the felsic Mudiah metavolcanics, and the felsic Mukeras dyke swarms. The host rocks of the dykes (granite (740 22 Ma), quartzdiorite, diorite and gabbro) have a calc-alkaline subduction zone signature, and they were probably emplaced in the roots of contemporary island arcs, similar to the old calc-alkaline granodiorite association (720 Ma) of Central Hijaz of Saudi Arabia. Carbonatite bodies, mainly those which occur as dykes, which are either apatite-bearing or RE-mineral-bearing (group III and group IV) are confirmed as carbonatites. However, petrochemistry suggests that other carbonate sheets are sedimentary marbles enveloped by granitoid gneisses...|$|R
40|$|The Hartbees River Thrust Belt (HRTS) is a 40 - 60 km wide, southwest-vergent zone {{of complex}} structure, lithostratigraphy and {{high-grade}} metamorphism {{in the northeastern}} part of the mid-Proterozoic Namaqua Tectonic Province. The HRTS comprises the boundary zone separating the Bushmanland and Gordonia Subprovinces of the Namaqua Province. A knowledge of the movement histories of major ductile shear zones within the HRTS is fundamental to understanding the tectonic development of the belt, and Namaqua tectogenesis as a whole. In spite of this, no detailed microstructural kinematic studies have been attempted and the movement histories and age relationships of these shear zones have not been described in detail. This thesis represents a detailed microstructural kinematic study of a representative suite of orientated samples of mylonitic rocks, collected from five ductile shear zones within the HRTS. These shear zones include the Neusspruit Lineament, the Kakamas shear zone (KSZ), the Hugosput shear system (HSS), the Rozynenbosch-Ganzenmond shear zone (RGSZ) and the Graafwater shear system (GSS). Accepted modern methods of microstructural kinematic analysis were applied to samples of mylonite from these shear zones, {{in order to determine}} the precise orientation of the kinematic vectors, and the sense and relative ages of movements on each of the shear zones. Shear sense criteria, including composite SoC planar fabrics and shear band foliations, asymmetrical porphyroclast systems, mica-fish, oblique grain-shape and subgrain fabrics, asymmetrical microfolds, and the displacement of fractured rigid grains, together with a well-developed mylonite elongation lineation, conclusively indicate that SSW-directed thrusting occurred along the HSS, RGSZ, GSS and possibly along the Neusspruit Lineament, while normal, top-to-NE movements occurred on the Neusspruit Lineament, KSZ and HSS. Rare transposition criteria, and textural and paragenetic contrasts between syn-kinematic fabrics, strongly suggest that the phase of normal, top-to-NE movement seen in the northeastern HRTS shear zones is younger than the more widespread top-to-SW thrusting event. On the basis of mesoscopic structural criteria, SSW-directed thrusting is correlated with the D₂ deformation event in the HRTS. The mylonite zones have been refolded by ENE-SSW trending F₃ <b>crossfolds,</b> whose demonstrated coaxial relationship to the mylonite elongation lineation precluded reorientation of primary kinematic vectors. In the southwestern HRTS, primary thrust vectors have been reoriented by right-lateral, strike-slip shearing adjacent to the Pofadder Lineament during D₄. Simple shear dispersion of mylonite lineations related to normal movement, suggests that they too have been modified by D₄ shearing, and this constrains the timing of extensional movements to post-D₂ and pre- or syn-D₄. Syn-kinematic mineral assemblages, rheological criteria and the annealing states of the mylonites, provide insight into the thermotectonic evolution of the shear zones. A model is proposed in which the movement histories of shear zones within the HRTS are explained in terms of a typical orogenic cycle, involving crustal thickening by thrusting during a compressional orogenic phase, followed by collapse of the thickened crust during an extensional taphrogenic phase. ...|$|R
