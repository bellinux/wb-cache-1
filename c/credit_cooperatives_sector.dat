Our VAR analysis shows that following a monetary contraction, the banking {{system as a whole}} attracts additional funds from foreign banks. Whereas small cooperative and savings banks do not seem to directly access the interbank market themselves, they do so indirectly through the head institutions of their sectors, i. e. the savings banks` and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>sector,</b> respectively. The interbank flows within these two sectors allow small banks to access funds that might help them in keeping their loan portfolio relatively unaffected. This may explain why the evidence for a bank lending channel in Germany seems to be weaker compared to other countries, e. g. the US.

Here we examine the relationship between size and scale economies of cooperative banks in Japan (namely Shinkin and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives).</b> We use the translog cost-function methodology and intermediation approach coupled with a large set of both cross-sectional and panel data over the period 2003 to 2006. We find significant diseconomies of scale for both the full sample and sub-samples of small and large cooperative banks. It is of interest to note that larger cooperative banks were at cost disadvantage as compared to small ones throughout most of the period. Thus, bigger is not always better.

40|$|The <b>credit</b> <b>cooperative</b> {{system was}} {{established}} in Greece in 1993, following {{the creation of the}} appropriate legislative framework. The Greek system distinguishes two types of institutions: the cooperative bank that functions as a bank and the <b>credit</b> <b>cooperative</b> that cannot provide banking services. The Greek cooperative system is characterized by the autonomous and nonhomogenous development of the <b>cooperative</b> banks and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> Moreover, in 2001 the cooperative banks created a central nation-wide bank that has since helped the further development of the <b>credit</b> <b>cooperative</b> system.

The process of granting credit is one of the central functions of a credit union; therefore, the use of instruments that support that process is desirable and may become a key factor in credit management. The steps undertaken by the present case study to perform the knowledge discovery process were data selection, data pre-processing and cleanup, data transformation, data mining, and the interpretation and evaluation of results. The results were evaluated through cross-validation of ten sets, repeated in ten simulations.

40|$|This project {{explores the}} {{relation}} between the magnitude of the <b>cooperative</b> <b>sector</b> and the degree of income inequality in a country. After a somewhat selective consideration of the possible linkages between the size of the <b>cooperative</b> <b>sector</b> and income inequality, and using Gini as the primary measure for income inequality and two proxies for the size of the <b>cooperative</b> <b>sector,</b> an empirical exploration is done in three ways. First, simple plots are used to judge the gross relation between Gini and each of the two proxies for the size of the <b>cooperative</b> <b>sector.</b> Both plots show a perceptible negative relation. Second, simple regressions of Gini are run on each measure of the <b>cooperative</b> <b>sector</b> to obtain quantitative correlates of the plots. The regression estimates show a highly significant negative relation between each proxy for the <b>cooperative</b> <b>sector</b> and Gini. Third, a more extended regression model is estimated after adding several control variables that have been suggested to affect income inequality. While estimated coefficients for the cooperative proxies continue to have negative signs in the extended model, their statistical significance is somewhat eroded relative to the conventional significance levels. Two other measures of income inequality show an even more perceptible negative association between income inequality and the <b>cooperative</b> <b>sector</b> size. While the multiple regression estimates indicate most control variables to lack statistical significance, mean years of school has a highly significant negative association with Gini, which is an informative outcome of the work. The estimates also show a significant positive association between both unemployment rate and natural resource endowment with the Gini coefficient. The main message from the study seems to be that, despite a low statistical significance in some of the regressions, there is considerable evidence of an inequality-attenuating role {{of the size of the}} <b>cooperative</b> <b>sector</b> in an economy...|$|R
40|$|Internationally {{acclaimed}} institutions {{within the}} development field, {{such as the}} United Nations (UN) and the International Labour Organization (ILO), have taken {{a keen interest in}} the cooperative model as a mechanism that can be utilised to promote financial inclusion. However, in Swaziland, there have been mixed views regarding the role of savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives</b> (SACCOs) in facilitating access to financial services for their members. Moreover, within applied economics literature, research has been scarce on the role of savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in facilitating access to credit. Additionally, there has been limited knowledge concerning the role of savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in promoting access to credit in developing economies like Swaziland. The main objective {{of this study was to}} assess the role of savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in promoting access to financial services, especially credit services to their members. Empirical analysis was based on both the qualitative and quantitative approaches that utilised a combination of primary and secondary data. The data was collected in a survey of 38 savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in Swaziland through face-to-face interviews with respondents and from the cooperative data analysis system (CODAS). The data analysis tool utilised for this analysis was the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 22. The results of the study indicated that savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in Swaziland have a high level of outreach with an average membership of 631 members, with 46 percent representing women, and also have one physical access point. In addition, in 2014 they managed to accumulate total assets worth E 17 333 051, mobilised savings worth E 13 501 341, and issued loans worth E 11 154 433. However, these savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives</b> also experienced a huge amount of outstanding loans, accumulating to E 12 542 230 in 2014, and a significantly low level of penetration of 3. 09 percent. The results of the study also showed that savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in Swaziland failed to meet international standards of financial sustainability set for cooperatives. The social performance indicators revealed that savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives</b> utilise occupation as the common bond. Their development goal is to improve financial access and eradicate poverty for their members, although the savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives</b> are modest in that they are established to target low-income and middle-income earners. The results also showed that the savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperatives</b> vary in terms of human resource policies and staff incentives. In addition, SACCOs were reluctant to invest in enterprise financing ventures and they also experienced low client retention. It also transpired from the results that the major challenges faced by financial cooperatives in Swaziland included low levels of skills and competition from commercial banks. Another major challenge that emerged from the results was the introduction of the Financial Service Regulatory Authority (FSRA), which has escalated the workload of savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperative</b> managers/clerks in preparing quarterly reports to be submitted. This has also brought about confusion within the savings and <b>credit</b> <b>cooperative</b> movement as they now report to two separate entities, the FSRA and the Commissioner of Cooperatives. Retirements and retrenchments comprised another major challenge cited by the respondents, as some of the SACCOs have lost their faithful members due to the ending of employment tenures, which has also influenced their client retention rate.
