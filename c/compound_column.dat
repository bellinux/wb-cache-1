40|$|Trees, {{when used}} as {{structural}} elements in their natural, round form, {{are up to}} five times stronger than the largest piece of dimensioned lumber they could yield. Additionally, these whole-timbers have a lower effective embodied carbon than any other structural material. When combined into efficient structural configurations and joined using specially-engineered connections, whole-timber {{has the potential to}} replace entire steel and concrete structural systems in large-scale buildings, bridges, and infrastructure. Whole-timber may be the most appropriate structural solution for a low-carbon and fully renewable future in both developed temperate regions and the developing Global South. To reduce barriers to adoption, including project complexity and cost, a standardized "kit of parts" in whole-timber is proposed. This thesis proposes new designs for the first and most important element of this kit: a structurally independent column in whole-timber. A 20 ' <b>compound</b> <b>column</b> in whole-timber is prototyped at full-scale. New, simple calculation methods are developed for estimating the buckling capacity of tapered timbers. Based on conservative assumptions, the embodied carbon of whole-timber column systems is shown to be between 30 % and 70 % lower than conventional steel systems. by Aurimas Bukauskas. Thesis: S.

Inexpensive aspen wood fibers have been investigated {{as a means to}} remove dissolved PAH under laboratory conditions. Our isotherm experiments demonstrated that the uptake of naphthalene, fluorene, anthracene, and pyrene required up to 12. 5 days to reach equilibrium. Aspen wood-water sorption coefficients, Kww, were linearly correlated to octanol-water partition coefficients and the molecular weight of the studied PAH <b>compounds.</b> <b>Column</b> experiments were carried out to study the sorption and desorption of fluorene, anthracene, and pyrene under dynamic conditions. The results indicate linear sorption, but non-linear desorption behavior. The degree of desorption was inversely correlated to a compound’s hydrophobicity. Flow interruption experiments showed that sorption and desorption was rate limited. A mass balance of the sorption and desorption tests indicated that sorbtive uptake exceeded desorptive release over a given number of pore volumes. Further, absolute massremoval efficiency increased with the molecular weight and hydrophobicity of the PAH <b>compound.</b> Batch and <b>column</b> studies demonstrated that aspen wood has the potential to become an effective remedial agent for PAH in stormwater runoff or other PAH contaminated waters...|$|R

The volatile extract, that is the essential oil was extracted from the leaves using hydrodistillation and analysis of compounds was done by GC/MS for composition. 32 compounds were obtained from the fresh leaves and 18 compounds were obtained from the dry leaves. The fresh oil contains caryophyllene (11. 8 percent) and caryophyllene oxide (11. 1 percent) as the main sesquiterpene component. α-Pinene(5. 0 percent) was the only monoterpene compound identified in the fresh oil in substantial amount.

Due to the briefness of this investigation, readers are invited to amplify and complete it, and if necessary to correct it, since it is probable that a new investigation may include errors of method. The contents can be summarised as follows: 1. The classical design calculation of anchorage plates should be revised since it is based on an inaccurate idea on the actual behaviour and strength potential of mass concrete. Designers should know that this method implies a safety factor of the order of 10. This knowledge should give him confidence in cases of possible error, or when base reinforcements have been omitted, or placed after loading the structure. 2. The new calculation criterion is given in art. 54 of Code IEH- 68, which authorises stresses to be increased, though still keeping them within fairly conservative limits. Since currently IEH- 68 is the standard calculation code, it is advised that is should be strictly followed, and this paper should not be an invitation to anyone to go beyond the authorised limits given in this code. The {{purpose of this paper is}} not to offer a more economic formula, but to clarify ideas. 3.
