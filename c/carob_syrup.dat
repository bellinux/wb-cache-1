40|$|The present work studied {{low-cost}} carbon {{sources for}} carotenoid and lipid production using the yeast Rhodosporidum toruloides NCYC 921. <b>Carob</b> pulp <b>syrup</b> and sugarcane molasses at different concentrations {{were used as}} low-cost carbon sources in R. toruloides batch cultivations. <b>Carob</b> pulp <b>syrup</b> containing a total sugar concentration of 75 g L 1 induced the highest total fatty acid productivity (1. 90 g L 1 h 1) and the highest carotenoid productivity (9. 79 lg L 1 h 1). Flow cytometric analysis revealed {{that most of the}} yeast cells (> 60 %) grown on <b>carob</b> pulp <b>syrup</b> displayed intact polarised membranes, conversely to the cells grown on sugarcane molasses, wherein a large proportion (> 45 %) displayed permeabilised cytoplasmic membranes...|$|R
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{effect of}} oxygen availability and carbon source concentration on yeast lipid and carotenoid production {{has never been}} studied before. In this work, a Doehlert distribution design was used to study the simultaneous effect of carbon concentration and oxygen availability on Rhodosporidium toruloides NCYC 921 carotenoid and lipid production. A cheap industrial byproduct was used as carbon source (<b>carob</b> pulp <b>syrup).</b> A total sugar concentration of 106. 3 g/L and a medium volume of 0. 120 L induced the highest total carotenoid and total fatty acid productivities (4. 60 ìg/Lh and 0. 029 g/Lh, respectively). Flow cytometry {{was used to assess}} yeast stress response under different cultivation conditions. The highest proportion of cells with permeabilised membrane (> 20 %) was induced when the cultivations were carried out at the highest sugar concentration studied (130. 0 g/L) or when the culture reached the minimum final medium pH (4. 60). The results showed that the total sugar concentration had a positive influence on the yeast biomass and carotenoid content, while the oxygen availability had little influence on the biomass concentration, but had a slight positive influence on the carotenoid content. Regarding the fatty acids, the two factors had a negative impact on the synthesis of these compounds...|$|R
40|$|Some yeasts like Rhodosporidium toruloides are {{oleaginous}} {{and can be}} {{used for}} biodiesel production. In addition, some strains are able to produce valuable carotenoid pigments which are of great commercial interest, contributing significantly to reduce the biodiesel production costs. Carotenoid extraction and quantification are time consuming, generate high amounts of waste and require the use of considerable amounts of biomass. Flow Cytometry (FC) can monitor carotenoids accumulation in yeasts, at line, and with a high statistical resolution, during growth. Moreover, during the cultivation it is important to assess cell physiological states, since injured or dead cells decrease the bioprocess yield. If this information is obtained near real time, it is possible to change the process control strategy in order to achieve the maximum lipid and carotenoid productivities. To obtain a more sustainable biodiesel production, {{it is also important to}} use low cost substrates, such as industrial by-products. In the present work, different low cost substrates were used as carbon sources [glycerol as a biodiesel byproduct, sugarcane molasses and <b>carob</b> pulp (<b>syrup)</b> as a cheap by-product of the food industry in the European south countries] to produce lipids and carotenoids by the yeast R. toruloides NCYC 921, and a comparison was made. Flow cytometry was used to monitor carotenoid content and cell viability (enzymatic activity, membrane potential and membrane integrity) during all the yeast cultivations...|$|R
50|$|Carob juice {{drinks are}} {{traditionally}} drunk during the Islamic month of Ramadan. Crushed pods {{may be used}} to make a beverage; compote, liqueur, and syrup are made from carob in Turkey, Malta, Portugal, Spain, and Sicily. Several studies suggest that carob may aid in treating diarrhea in infants. In Libya, <b>carob</b> <b>syrup</b> (there called rub) is used as a complement to asida. The so-called <b>carob</b> <b>syrup</b> made in Peru is actually from the fruit of the Prosopis nigra tree.|$|E
50|$|In Cyprus, <b>carob</b> <b>syrup</b> {{is known}} as Cyprus's black gold, and is widely exported. In Malta, a syrup (ġulepp tal-ħarrub) {{is made out of}} carob pods. This is a {{traditional}} medicine for coughs and sore throat. <b>Carob</b> <b>syrup</b> is also used in Crete as a natural sweetener, and is considered a natural source of calcium. It contains three times more calcium than milk. It is also rich in iron, phosphorus, and natural fibers (Due to its strong taste, it can be found mixed with orange or chocolate).|$|E

40|$|Most of the world’s {{energy is}} {{generated}} from the {{burning of fossil fuels}} such as oil and its derivatives. When burnt, these fuels release into the atmosphere volatile organic compounds, sulfur as sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and the fine particulate matter of metal sulfates. These are pollutants which can be responsible for bronchial irritation, asthma attacks, cardio-pulmonary diseases and lung cancer mortality, and they also contribute for the occurrence of acid rains and the increase of the hole in the ozone layer. For these reasons countries around the world imposed legal maxima to sulfur concentration on fuels. Forcing companies to develop methods of removing the sulfur contained in the oil. The most common is hydrodesulfurization which employs high pressures and temperatures associated with complex metal catalysts making it extremely expensive. So, it becomes important to explore alternatives such as biodesulfurization (BDS). This process is based on the use of microorganisms for the removal of sulfur form even from the most recalcitrant compounds at atmospheric pressure and temperature, making it cheaper and more eco-friendly. However it still presents some drawbacks, such as being easily inhibited in the presence of sulfates, which have been shown to have great inhibitory effect even in amounts as low as 6 mg/l [1]. In order to further reduce the costs associated with BDS it is possible to explore alternative carbon sources, as previously shown with <b>carob</b> pulp <b>syrup</b> and recycled paper sludge [1, 2]. The main objective of this work is the optimization of sulfate removal, from Jerusalem artichoke juice, in order to use it as an alternative carbon source for BDS...|$|R
40|$|Five {{different}} formulations containing buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) flour {{were used}} in this study to produce biscuit samples which were then analyzed for proximate composition, textural and sensory properties. The different formulations based on incorporation of egg white, <b>carob</b> <b>syrup,</b> and purified starches into the dough formulation yielded final products with different nutritional, sensory, and textural properties. Use of <b>carob</b> <b>syrup</b> to replace table sugar resulted in biscuits with higher outer appearance scores and significantly harder texture. Purified starch substitution on the other hand resulted in high fracturability values. They also had lower protein and higher energy contents. Egg white substitution was aimed at increasing cohesion in the biscuit dough, however, the dough texture of the plain formulation was also acceptable and very subtle differences in biscuit quality were observed with this alteration in the basic formula...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The aim of {{this work}} {{is to provide a}} process for obtaining natural <b>carob</b> <b>syrup</b> of Morocco carob pods and their total and {{reducing}} sugar. Samples were collected from different regions in the agro-forestry system of Morocco. The total sugar and reducing sugar in pods obtained from different regions were 31. 5 – 50. 1 and 10. 2 – 14. 6 g/ 100 g (%w/w), respectively. Experimental design was used to investigate the effect of three parameters (extraction temperature, extraction time and ratio of water to pulp) on syrups yields. The ranges of the factors investigated were 20 – 45 °C for extraction temperature (X 1), 1 – 3 h for extraction time (X 2) and 1 – 3 for extraction ratio of water to pulp (X 3). The extracting parameters for syrups yields were optimized by using three-factor-three-level Box Behnken design (BBD) and response surface methodology based on the single-factor experiments. As results, the optimum conditions were extracting temperature 43. 45 °C, extracting time 2. 40 h and the ratio of extraction solvent (water) to pulp (v/w) 2. 27. Under these conditions, the experimental values were in close agreement with values predicted by the model and for wish. The yield of syrup from the different regions varies between 28. 76 and 37. 22 g/ 100 g (%w/w). Populations from Essaouira and Beni-Mellal have higher levels of sugar and yield of syrup. The values obtained vary according to the origin of the samples. The carob distribution in Morocco is centered in the north selvage of the Atlas chain, the Rif Mountain and in some valleys of the south-west of the Anti-Atlas confined to arid and semi-arid bioclimates with an extension to sub-humid bioclimate in some stands [5]...|$|E
