5000|$|From the {{heredity}} perspective, {{relations are}} individuals that inherited genes {{from one or}} more common ancestors. Therefore, their [...] "relationship" [...] can be quantified {{on the basis of}} the probability that they each have inherited a copy of an allele from the common ancestor. In earlier sections, the Inbreeding coefficient has been defined as, [...] "the probability that two same alleles ( [...] A and A, or a and a [...] ) have a common origin"—or, more formally, [...] "The probability that two homologous alleles are autozygous." [...] Previously, the emphasis was on an individuals likelihood of having two such alleles, and the coefficient was framed accordingly. It is obvious, however, that this probability of autozygosity for an individual must also be the probability that each of its two parents had this autozygous allele. In this re-focused form, the probability is called the co-ancestry coefficient for the two individuals i and j ( [...] f ij [...] ). In this form, it can be used to quantify the relationship between two individuals, and may also be known as the coefficient of kinship or the <b>consanguinity</b> <b>coefficient.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{frequencies}} of the different types of consanguineous marriages, up to the level of second cousins, using as a source the ecclesiastical dispensations given from 1900 to 1979 in the Archbishopric of Santiago de Compostela (Galicia, Spain). We also report the rate of <b>consanguinity,</b> the average <b>coefficient</b> of inbreeding, and its evolution. From 1900 to 1979, 15, 739 consanguineous marriages were registered, corresponding to 25 different categories of relationship. The rate of consanguinity {{of the total number of}} consanguineous marriages is 5. 13...|$|R
40|$|The genetic factors {{contribute}} significantly to the determination of dermatoglyphic traits is well established. However, the controversies in views and findings of this issue are still inconclusive. The present study {{is an attempt to}} evaluate the inheritance of quantitative dermatoglyphic traits with asymmetry (DA and FA) and diversity (Div) through sibling correlations. Data include 218 individuals from (88 families) in a small isolate, the nomadic tribe Muzeina {{with a high degree of}} consanguinity (0. 09) from South Sinai. Statistical analyses include sibling correlations, cross-correlations and genetic correlation (GC) – a ratio of sibling cross-correlation between traits divided on square root of the both traits sibling correlation product. The familial correlation coefficients for quantitative dermatoglyphic traits are perhaps expected lower in such a small isolated and consanguineous population than our previous studied in Indian populations and Chuvashian populations from Russia. These results indicate a simpler genetic basis due to high degree (0. 09 inbreeding <b>coefficient)</b> of <b>consanguinity</b> in Muzeina Bedouin tribe. There is no evidence of major gene involvement, although a little genetic effect obtained from familial correlations on asymmetry (DA and FA) and diversity (Div) traits through sibling correlations. The significant interaction between sexes was found, which contradicts with the other populations perhaps due to high level of <b>consanguinity.</b> Lower correlation <b>coefficients</b> than in other non-consanguineous populations for quantitative dermatoglyphic traits indicate a simpler genetic basis due to high degree of inbreeding coefficient (0. 09) in Muzeina. Dermatoglyphic asymmetry and diversity traits may be due to environmental factors rather than dominance in Bedouins, although a little genetic effect was found suggests a measure of developmental instability in human (FA) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Marriage between close {{relatives}} has been practised globally {{since the early}} existence of human society. The role of consanguinity and inbreeding affecting human health is a topic of great interest in medical genetics. Objective: The objective {{of the study was}} to investigate the extent of consanguinity and its effects on common non-communicable diseases, the related risk factors, its role in human health and susceptibility to various chronic and complex diseases in Qatari population. Subjects and methods: The study design was a cross-sectional and multi-stage sampling based on Hospitals and primary health care [PHC] centres. A representative sample of 1626 subjects were approached and 1228 subjects (75. 5 %) consented to participate in the study between January 2013 and May 2014. The questionnaire based on socio-demographic data and for responses, on the Premarital Screening and Genetic Counseling [PMSGC] program knowledge, attitude and practice statements. Additionally, questions were asked regarding services, activities, how to attract and motivate the genetics counseling and screening for the hereditary diseases programme. Results: The mean age ± S. D of the 1228 women interviewed was 39. 25  ±  9. 57  years. The rate of consanguinity in the present generation was 43. 5 % [95 % CI =  47. 7 – 54. 4]. There were statistically significant differences between males and females with regards to age, educational status, occupation status, household income, consanguinity, BMI, cigarette smoking and sheesha (water pipe) smoking. The <b>consanguinity</b> rate and <b>coefficient</b> of inbreeding in the parental was significantly higher than the maternal rate (44. 3 % versus 41. 4 %; p <  0. 001) (0. 018738 versus 0. 017571 maternal). The current generation of consanguineous parents had a slightly higher risk for diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, blood and mental disorders, heart diseases, asthma, gastro-intestinal disorders, hypertension, hearing deficit, G 6 PD and common eye diseases. Conclusion: The present study revealed a higher incidence of certain diseases in consanguineous population with a high significant increase in the prevalence of common adult diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, blood disorders, mental disorders, heart diseases, asthma, gastro-intestinal disorders, hypertension, hearing deficit, G 6 PD and common eye diseases. This confirms the role of genetic factors across the full spectrum of disease and not only for Mendelian disorders...|$|R
