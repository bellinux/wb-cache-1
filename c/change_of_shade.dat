In the {{portrait}} of the Hausmann George Gyzen,[25] every accessory is perfect with a fine perfection: the carnations in the glass vase by his side--the ball of gold, chased with blue enamel, suspended on the wall--the books--the steelyard--the papers on the table, the seal-ring, with its quartered bearings,--all intensely there, and there in beauty of which {{no one could have}} dreamed that even flowers or gold were capable, far less parchment or steel. But every <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shade</b> is felt, every rich and rubied line of petal followed; every subdued gleam in the soft blue of the enamel and bending of the gold touched with a hand whose patience of regard creates rather than paints. The jewel itself was not so precious as the rays of enduring light which form it, and flash from it, beneath that errorless hand. The man himself, what he was--not more; but to all conceivable proof of sight--in all aspect of life or thought--not less. He sits alone in his accustomed room, his common work laid out before him; he is conscious of no presence, assumes no dignity, bears no sudden or superficial look of care or interest, lives only as he lived--but forever.|$|E
60|$|In {{returning}} {{we spent}} two days at Socgo, and I employed them in collecting insects in the forest. The greater number of trees, although so lofty, are not more than three or four feet in circumference. There are, of course, a few of much greater dimension. Senhôr Manuel was then making a canoe 70 feet in length from a solid trunk, which had originally been 110 feet long, and of great thickness. The contrast of palm trees, growing amidst the common branching kinds, never fails to give the scene an intertropical character. Here the woods were ornamented by the Cabbage Palm--one {{of the most beautiful}} of its family. With a stem so narrow that it might be clasped with the two hands, it waves its elegant head at the height of forty or fifty feet above the ground. The woody creepers, themselves covered by other creepers, were of great thickness: some which I measured were two feet in circumference. Many of the older trees presented a very curious appearance from the tresses of a liana hanging from their boughs, and resembling bundles of hay. If the eye was turned from the world of foliage above, to the ground beneath, it was attracted by the extreme elegance of the leaves of the ferns and mimosae. The latter, in some parts, covered the surface with a brushwood only a few inches high. In walking across these thick beds of mimosae, a broad track was marked by the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shade,</b> produced by the drooping of their sensitive petioles. It is easy to specify the individual objects of admiration in these grand scenes; but {{it is not possible to}} give an adequate idea of the higher feelings of wonder, astonishment, and devotion, which fill and elevate the mind.|$|E

Results of Experiment 1 suggested that the human visual system is more sensitive to expanding convex circles (which create the impression of approaching objects) than others. In Experiment 2, the targets and distractors were defined by expanding (or contracting) step gradient (top-lighting/bottom-lighting) circles.

There {{was a strong}} linear relationship between {{the rate of change}} of daily maximum temperature and the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shade</b> such that downstream from a 100 % <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shade</b> the heating/cooling rates are ᴰC h- 1 and ᱰàkm- 1 (upper bound ᶰC h- 1 and ᱵàkm- 1) respectively. These high rates only apply over short distances and travel times because downstream water temperatures adjust to the new level of shade and reach a dynamic equilibrium. Shade was too patchy in the study streams to measure how long water takes to reach equilibrium, however, using an existing computer model, we estimate that this occurs after ~ 1200 m (travel time 4 h). Further modelling work is desirable to predict equilibrium temperatures under given meteorological, flow and shade conditions.

40|$|Purpose:Dental shade guides are {{commonly}} used for color determination and should be disinfected and sterilized. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the color change of Vita 3 D Master shade tabs after disinfection and sterilization. Material and methods:Overall, 98 samples (shade tabs) were randomly selected from 14 new, unused Vita 3 D sets, including the following shades: 2 M 1, 3 L 1. 5, 3 M 1, 3 M 2, 3 M 3, 3 R 1. 5 and 4 M 1. In each set, values of 2, 3 and 4, chroma of 1, 2 and 3 and hue were selected for the comparison of different shades. All tabs were measured using the Vita Easyshade device at baseline. The first group was disinfected with Deconex and the second group was sterilized by autoclaving in a simulated annual application. All the tabs were measured again using the same device. This process was repeated to simulate 2 and 3 years of usage. Statistical analysis was conducted by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent t-test and paired sample t-test. Results:In the disinfected group, we observed significant differences in value and chroma in all periods (p˂ 0. 001). However, hue showed no significant difference after the first year of simulated treatment (p= 0. 527), though it was significantly different in the second and third simulations (p˂ 0. 001). In the sterilized group, all variables showed a significant difference for each year (p˂ 0. 05). Considering total color difference (ΔE), there was a significant difference between the two groups in the first, second and third simulated years; ΔE increased in the sterilized group more than in the disinfected samples (p˂ 0. 001).   Conclusions:  The color <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shade</b> tabs was significant both after disinfection by a chemical solution and by sterilization through autoclaving. However, although disinfectants may not have a clinically important effect, sterilization should be considered as an interfering factor during color-matching procedure...|$|E
