40|$|The goal of {{this first}} National Strategy on <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> Young People’s Participation in Decision-making {{is to ensure that}} <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people will have a voice in their {{individual}} and collective everyday lives across the five national outcome areas. The strategy is primarily aimed at <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people under the age of 18, but also embraces the voice of young people in the transition to adulthood up to the age of 24. The strategy is guided and influenced by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the <b>Child</b> (UNCRC) <b>and</b> the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The strategy focuses on the everyday lives of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people and the places and spaces in which they are entitled to have a voice in decisions that affect their lives. Accordingly, the strategy identifies the following objectives and priority areas for action: 1. <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> young people will have a voice in decisions made in their local communities. 2. <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> young people will have a voice in decision-making in early education, schools and the wider formal and non-formal education systems. 3. <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> young people will have a voice in decisions that affect their health and well-being, including on the health and social services delivered to them. 4. <b>Children</b> <b>and</b> young people will have a voice in the Courts and legal system. The strategy contains a series of additional objectives, which include: 5. Promoting effective leadership to champion and promote participation of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people. 6. Development of education and training for professionals working with and on behalf of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people. 7. Mainstreaming the participation of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people in the development of policy, legislation and research. Underlying all objectives in this strategy are the following key fundamentals: • recognition that <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young {{people have a right to}} participate in decisions that affect their lives; • ensuring the protection <b>and</b> welfare of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people in accordance with Children First: National Guidance for the Protection <b>and</b> Welfare of <b>Children</b> 4; • improving and establishing mechanisms to ensure the participation of seldom-heard <b>and</b> vulnerable <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people in decision-making; • collection of data, monitoring <b>and</b> evaluation of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people’s participation initiatives...|$|R

40|$|<b>Children</b> <b>and</b> {{young people}} who {{experience}} domestic violence are often represented as passive witnesses, too vulnerable to tell the stories of their own lives. This article reports on findings from a 2 year European research project (Understanding Agency and Resistance Strategies, UNARS) with <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people in Greece, Italy, Spain and the UK, who had experienced domestic violence. It explores <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people’s understandings of their own capacity to reflect on and disclose their experiences Extracts from individual interviews with 107 <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people (age 8 – 18) were analysed. Three themes are presented, that illustrate <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people’s strategies for managing disclosure: (1) “Being silenced or choosing silence?”, explores <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people’s practices of self-silencing; (2) “Managing disclosures: Finding ways to tell” outlines how <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people value self-expression, and the strategies they use to disclose safely; and in (3) “Speaking with many voices” considers how <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people’s accounts of their experiences are constituted relationally, and are often polyvocal. The article concludes that <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people can be articulate, strategic and reflexive communicators, and that good support for families struggling with domestic violence must enable space for <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people’s voice to be heard. This is possible only in an integrated framework able to encompass multiple layers and perspectives, rather than privileging the adult point of view. Practitioners who work with families affected by domestic violence {{need to recognize that}} <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people are able to reflect on and speak about their experiences. This requires that attention is paid to the complexity of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people’s communication practices, and the relational context of those communications...|$|R

The Transforming Youth Custody report found 50 per cent of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people aged 15 - 17 years-old were entering custody with literacy levels the equivalent of children aged 7 - 11 years-old. From the <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people entering custody, 18 per cent had statements of special educational needs and 36 per cent of young men ceased attending school at 14 years-old. Figures from the Transforming Youth Custody report, support research conducted by Bryan (2004) that <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people aged between 18 and 21 years-old in YOI has a high proportion of language difficulties. Such concerns highlight the importance of exploring the educational background of <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people entering custody and the importance of addressing educational issues before <b>children</b> <b>and</b> young people enter custody.
