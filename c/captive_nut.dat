5000|$|Garden hoses connect using a male/female thread connection. Spigots {{typically}} have male connectors, and {{one end of}} a hose has a <b>captive</b> <b>nut</b> which fits the threads. The technical term for this arrangement is a [...] "hose union".|$|E
5000|$|A clip-on nut, {{also known}} as a sheet metal nut or a speed nut (but this is ambiguous, see speed nut), is a type of nut {{designed}} to be clipped to sheet metal. It is a type of <b>captive</b> <b>nut</b> commonly made as a cage nut.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{standardized}} methods in use to attach the hose or tube to the component. Some are intended for ease of use and service, others are better for higher system pressures or control of leakage. The most common method, in general, is to provide in each component a female-threaded port, on each hose or tube a female-threaded <b>captive</b> <b>nut,</b> and use a separate adapter fitting with matching male threads to connect the two. This is functional, economical to manufacture, and easy to service.|$|E
5000|$|Rack Rail {{comes in}} two {{different}} commonly used forms. Tapped/threaded rack rail has round holes tapped for 10/32 UNF screws. The other common form of rack rail is square hole rack strip which has square holes for M6 <b>captive</b> <b>nuts</b> that are clipped into the holes as needed to mount equipment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Captive</b> <b>nuts</b> come in {{two basic}} styles. One type, the cage nut or clip-on nut is a {{conventional}} <b>nut</b> held <b>captive</b> by a sheet metal carrier that clips onto the part to be connected. These are generally used to attach screws to sheet metal parts too thin to be threaded, andthey can generally be attached, removed and reused with simple hand tools.|$|R
50|$|In Malaysia, {{he retired}} from the race {{following}} problems with a new <b>captive</b> wheel <b>nut</b> system that the team had introduced {{at the beginning of the}} season.|$|R
50|$|Wire clamps {{consist of}} a piece of heavy wire, {{typically}} steel, first bent into a tight U, then formed into a ring shape with one end overlapping the other, and finally the ends bent outwards and cut. A <b>captive</b> <b>nut</b> is attached to one end, and a captive screw to the other. When the screw is tightened, the overlapped ends of the wire are pushed apart, tightening the wire loop around the hose. For an explanation of why this design is used, see the section on sealing the connection.|$|E
50|$|The {{second type}} of <b>captive</b> <b>nut</b> is a {{threaded}} insert. These are either pressed into holes in the material to be joined or moulded in. In either case, part of the insert is generally knurled {{to get a good}} grip on the material supporting the insert. One variant, the swage nut, has a knurled portion that swages the sides of a soft metal hole to more tightly grip the nut. Press fit and swaged captive nuts are used in panels that are too thin to be threaded or in soft materials that are too weak to be threaded. They are installed by pressing them in with an arbor press.|$|E
50|$|The air {{pressure}} in an inflated tire holds the inner valve body shut. A small screw and <b>captive</b> <b>nut</b> {{on the top}} of the valve body permits the valve to be screwed shut and ensure that it remains tightly closed. The nut must be unscrewed to permit airflow in either direction. This must be done before attaching a pump. The screw remains captive on the valve body even when unscrewed fully; it is tightened again after the tire is inflated and the pump removed. The valve cap protects the valve body, keeps dirt and mud out of the mechanism, and also prevents the valve from damaging the tube when it is rolled for storage, but is not necessary to prevent pressure loss.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} shape today is hexagonal, for similar reasons as the bolt head: six sides {{give a good}} {{granularity}} of angles for a tool to approach from (good in tight spots), but more (and smaller) corners would be vulnerable to being rounded off. It takes only one sixth of a rotation to obtain the next side of the hexagon and grip is optimal. However, polygons with more than six sides do not give the requisite grip and polygons with fewer than six sides take more time {{to be given a}} complete rotation. Other specialized shapes exist for certain needs, such as wingnuts for finger adjustment and <b>captive</b> <b>nuts</b> (e.g. cage nuts) for inaccessible areas.|$|R
50|$|Prototypes {{are very}} often {{constructed}} by hand, or with more limited tooling. This {{is done to}} save costs where the design {{may not even be}} subsequently approved for manufacture. Once the go-ahead for a production run is given, the much more costly production tooling can be ordered. At this stage, the design itself may need to be reworked or altered to streamline production. The goal is to reduce costs as much as possible at the assembly stage, since costs will be multiplied by the number of units produced. For example, a prototype might be assembled using nuts and bolts, but in production such fasteners might be replaced by <b>captive</b> <b>nuts</b> or threaded holes built into the parts, making assembly much faster, easier and therefore cheaper.|$|R
40|$|Proposed {{mechanism}} placed behind panel fastens panel to, or unfastens it from, underlying structure. Electric {{motor and}} gearbox drives bolt to engage or disengage <b>captive</b> floating <b>nut.</b> Used where head at outer end of bolt or other fastener covered with protective outer layer on panel and inner end of bolt inaccessible...|$|R
50|$|A {{cage nut}} or caged nut (also called a <b>captive</b> or clip <b>nut)</b> {{consists}} of a (usually square) nut in a spring steel cage which wraps around the nut. The cage has two wings that when compressed allow the cage to be inserted into the square holes, for example, in the mounting rails of equipment racks. When the wings are released, they hold the nut in position behind the hole. Cage nuts conforming to this description were patented in 1952 and 1953.|$|R
5000|$|Drain rods are {{plumbing}} equipment used {{to attempt to}} unblock drains and sewers. The set normally consists of several stiff, but flexible, rods, each approximately one meter long, which may be screwed together end-to-end. The material is often polypropylene heavy gauge tubing. Jointing of the plastic to metal is done in hydraulic presses and these joints are the achilles heel of this rod type. Often, when subjected to force, the joint breaks. Better quality ends have securing pins through the differing materials. More expensive rods are high tensile steel. End connections are often brass or steel, the better steel type having cadmium plating for corrosion resistance. Two types of threaded end can be purchased. Cheaper ones simply screw together, male to female but have the disadvantage of needing one-way rotation in use to prevent unscrewing. Better quality rods have their ends formed into a square peg, mating in a matching square hole in the adjacent rod. A <b>captive</b> threaded <b>nut</b> then screw locks both lengths together making a firm joint. A spanner tightens the joint firmly.|$|R
