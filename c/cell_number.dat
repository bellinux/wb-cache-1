In addition, we aimed to investigate the involvement of corticotrophinreleasing factor in these stress-related alterations. Eighteen adult rats were divided into 3 experimental groups: 1) a saline-pretreated non-stressed group, 2) a saline-pretreated stressed group, and 3) an astressin-pretreated stressed group. The <b>numbers</b> of mast <b>cells,</b> EC cells, and PAR 2 -positive cells were counted in 6 high power fields. In proximal colonic segments, mast <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> of stressed rats tended to be higher than those of nonstressed rats, and their PAR 2 -positive <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were significantly higher than those of non-stressed rats.

40|$|Post-natal {{testicular}} {{development is}} dependent on gonadotrophin and androgen stimulation. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) acts through receptors (FSHR) on the Sertoli cell to stimulate spermatogenesis while androgens promote testis growth through receptors (AR) on the Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and peritubular myoid cells. In this study we have examined the effects on testis development of ablating FSHRs (FSHRKO mice) and/or ARs ubiquitously (ARKO mice) or specifically on the Sertoli cells (SCARKO mice). <b>Cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were measured using stereological methods. In ARKO mice Sertoli <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were reduced at all ages from birth until adulthood. FSHR ablation also caused small reductions in Sertoli <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> up to day 20 with more marked effects seen in the adult. Germ <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were unaffected by FSHR and/or AR ablation at birth. By day 20 ubiquitous AR or FSHR ablation caused a marked reduction in germ <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> with a synergistic effect of losing both receptors (germ <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> in FSHRKO. ARKO mice were 3 % of control). Germ <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> in SCARKO mice were less affected. By adulthood, in contrast, clear synergistic control of germ <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> had become established between the actions of FSH and androgen through the Sertoli <b>cells.</b> Leydig <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were normal on day 1 and day 5 in all groups.

40|$|By {{standard}} convention, {{in order}} to increase the efficacy of metabolite detection from cell culture lysates, metabolite extracts from a large quantity of cells are utilized for multiple reaction monitoring-based metabolomic studies. Metabolomics from a small <b>number</b> of <b>cell</b> extracts offers a potential economical alternative to increased <b>cell</b> <b>numbers,</b> in turn increasing the utility of cell culture-based metabolomics. However, the effect of reduced <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> on targeted metabolomic profiling is relatively unstudied. Considering the limited knowledge available of the feasibility and accuracy of microscale cell culture metabolomics, the present study analyzes differences in metabolomic profiles of different <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> of three pancreatic cancer cell lines. Specifically, it examines the effects of reduced <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> on metabolite profiles by obtaining extracts either directly from microscale culture plates or through serial dilution of increased numbers of cellular metabolite extracts. Our results indicate reduced <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> only modestly affect the number of metabolites detected (93 % of metabolites detected in <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> as low as 104 cells and 97 % for 105 cells), independent of the method used to obtain the cells. However, metabolite peak intensities were differentially affected by the reduced <b>cell</b> <b>numbers,</b> with some peak intensities inversely proportional to the <b>cell</b> <b>numbers.</b> To help eliminate such potential inverse relationships, peak intensities for increased <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were excluded from the comparative analysis. Overall, metabolite profiles from microscale culture plates were observed to differ from the serial dilution samples, which may be attributable to the medium-to-cell-number ratios. Finally, findings identify perturbations in metabolomic profiling for cellular extracts from reduced <b>cell</b> <b>numbers,</b> which offer future applications in microscale metabolomic evaluations...|$|R

25|$|A {{disregulation}} of {{the cell}} cycle components may lead to tumor formation. As mentioned above, when some genes like the cell cycle inhibitors, RB, p53 etc. mutate, they may cause the cell to multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Although the duration of cell cycle in tumor cells is equal to or longer than that of normal cell cycle, the proportion of cells that are in active cell division (versus quiescent cells in G0 phase) in tumors {{is much higher than}} that in normal tissue.

It is proved that Bcl-2 level in AVPV is higher whereas Bax level is lower in females than in males, just as being opposite of those in MPNc.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the dynamics of}} neuroendocrine (NE) <b>cell</b> <b>numbers,</b> the intensity of specific 5 -HT fluorescence, and the arterial medial thickness in the lungs of neonatal rabbits in normoxia and acute and chronic hypoxia. Hypoxic neonates had significantly higher NE <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> and medial thickness of the pulmonary arteries at 5 days of age than did normoxic controls; 1 - and 3 -day-old young that died in hypoxia also had significantly higher <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> and medial thickness than did hypoxic survivors. A decline in these <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> was noted between 1 and 5 days of age among normoxic young, whereas {{there was no significant}} change among hypoxic young. Medial thickness was unchanged among normoxic young but increased between 1 and 5 days of age among hypoxic survivors. A 1 -day exposure to normoxia of hypoxic young four days postpartum caused a decrease in NE <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> and medial thickness to more normal values. Serotonin (5 -HT) fluorescence intensity levels of groups of NE cells or neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) in this group were equal to those of normal controls although these levels were decreased in early chronic hypoxia. Medial thickness and NE <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were inversely correlated with serotonin levels, suggesting that serotonin may be associated with medial hypertrophy and presence of argyrophil material. Medial thickness was positively correlated with NE <b>cell</b> <b>numbers.</b> The above findings led to the following summary: pulmonary NE cells respond to changes in airway oxygen levels; hypoxia or decreased oxygen is associated with decreased cellular 5 -HT content and an increase in NE <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> by argyrophil stain and medial thickness of pulmonary artery walls. The change to normoxia from hypoxia results in higher cellular 5 -HT content and decreased NE argyrophil <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> along with reduced pulmonary artery wall medial thickness...|$|R

25|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known {{bacterial}} adaptation to stress is the formation of endospores. Endospores are bacterial survival structures that are highly resistant to {{many different types of}} chemical and environmental stresses and therefore enable the survival of bacteria in environments that would be lethal for these cells in their normal vegetative form. It has been proposed that endospore formation has allowed for the survival of some bacteria for hundreds of millions of years (e.g. in salt crystals) although these publications have been questioned. Endospore formation is limited to several genera of gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus and Clostridium. It differs from reproductive spores in that only one spore is formed per cell resulting in no net gain in <b>cell</b> <b>number</b> upon endospore germination. The location of an endospore within a cell is species-specific and can be used to determine the identity of a bacterium. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound which composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores and is implicated in being responsible for the heat resistance of endospores. Archeologists have found viable endospores taken from the intestines of Egyptian mummies and also from sediment of over seven thousand years old taken from Minnesota's Elk Lake.|$|E

Jejunal mast <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> returned to normal during a chronic phase of infection. The cells lost their ability to respond to antigenic stimulation following limited steroid treatment.

In our endeavours to understand the role of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 in thymocyte function, we compared cell profiles in thymus and spleen of wild-type with those of UCP 1 knock-out mice, which in turn led to comparative investigations of apoptotic potential in thymocytes from these mice. We demonstrate that spleen <b>cell</b> <b>numbers</b> were reduced 3 -fold in UCP 1 knock-out mice compared to wild-type mice.

2500|$|Choline is in {{high demand}} during {{pregnancy}} as a substrate for building cellular membranes, (rapid fetal and mother tissue expansion), increased need for one-carbon moieties (a substrate for addition of methylation to DNA and other functions), raising choline stores in fetal and placental tissues, and for increased production of lipoproteins (proteins containing [...] "fat" [...] portions). In particular, there is interest in the impact of choline consumption on the brain. This stems from choline's use as a material for making cellular membranes, (particularly in making phosphatidylcholine). Human brain growth is most rapid during the third trimester of pregnancy {{and continues to be}} rapid to approximately five years of age. During this time, the demand is high for sphingomyelin, which is made from phosphytidyl choline (and thus from choline), because this material is used to myelinate (insulate) nerve fibers. Choline is also in demand for the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which can influence the structure and organization of brain regions, neurogenesis, myelination, and synapse formation.
