Nevertheless, few {{of them have been}} interested in decreasing the problem complexity and reducing the research space of correspondences between the input ontologies. This paper presents a new approach for ontology alignment based on the ontology knowledge mining. The latter consists on producing for each ontology a hierarchical structure of fuzzy conceptual clusters, where a concept can belong to several clusters simultaneously. Each level of the hierarchy reflects the knowledge granularity degree of the knowledge base in order to improve the effectiveness and speediness of the information retrieval. Actually, such method allows the knowledge granularity analyze between the ontologies and facilitates several ontology engineering techniques. The ontology alignment process is performed iteratively over the produced hierarchical structure of the fuzzy clusters using semantic techniques. Once the correspondent clusters are identified, we consider both syntactic and structural characteristics of their <b>correspondent</b> <b>entities.</b> The proposed approach has been tested over the OAEI benchmark dataset and some real mammographic ontologies since this work is a part of CMCU project for Mammographic images analysis for Assistance Diagnostic Breast Cancer. The system performs good results in the terms of precision and recall with respect to other alignment system...|$|E

Saarland; Post, Telegraph and Telephone Administration of the Saarland), keeping the headquarters in Saarbr√ºcken. Postal vehicles and postboxes were green (RAL 6001), like in France. The French established the Saar Protectorate in December 1947, and on 1 April 1948 the P.T.T. Saarland issued a new series inscribed [...] "SAARPOST", followed by another in 1949 inscribed [...] "SAAR". The P.T.T. Saarland issued a few commemoratives each year through 1956, punctuated by a definitive set showing various buildings, in 1952.|$|R

If a mobile station does not support any bearer capability at all then it must respond to a SETUP message with a RELEASE COMPLETE message. In the call control protocol, more than one CC entity are defined. Each CC entity is independent from each other and communicates with the <b>correspondent</b> peer <b>entity</b> using its own MM connection. Different CC entities use different transaction identifiers.|$|R
