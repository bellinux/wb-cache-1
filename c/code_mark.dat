EC publisher William Gaines was called before a Senate committee to testify, but he remained defensive saying that he was already censoring the more extreme things from his books.

Current source code query systems lack sufficient formalism and offer limited query capabilities. In this paper, we introduce the formal framework of Source Code Algebra (SCA), and outline a source code query system based on it. SCA provides a formal data model for source code, an algebraic expression-based query language, and opportunities for query optimization. An algebraic model of source code addresses the issues of conceptual integrity, expressive power, and performance of a source code query system within a unified framework.

40|$|Sugar beet {{root rot}} has {{severely}} occurred {{in our country}} recently, especially in localities of Pazova, Pećinci, Ruma, Sremska Mitrovica and Šid. From diseased roots {{as well as from}} soil collected from the localities where decay occurred, fungal isolates were obtained by bait plant method. Based on their characteristics, they were identified as multinucleate Rhizoctonia sp. During the year of 2004 in Mitrosrem trial field T- 11, where the presence of multinucleate Rhizoctonia sp. was confirmed, an experiment under the coordination of Committee for Acknowledgement and Registration of New Cultivars in our country was conducted in order to determine cultivars' tolerance, i. e. their susceptibility and possibility for growing on infested fields. Six cultivars of sugar beet, Laetitia (as standard) and five new ones were included in the investigation. The trial was conducted in accordance with the established and accepted method (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Resources, Republic of Serbia). Susceptibility of investigated cultivars was evaluated according to significant production characteristics root yield, sugar content, corrected sugar content, thick juice Q, molasses sugar, content of K, Na and amino-N, polarized sugar yield and white sugar yield, as it was recommended by the method. Conducted investigations have revealed that tested sugar beet cultivars showed different reactions to natural infection with multinucleate Rhizoctonia sp. Concerning root yield as the most important agricultural characteristic, statistically significantly higher yield was obtained with the cultivar under <b>code</b> <b>mark</b> 5 (61. 120 kg/ha) whereas the cultivar marked under code 6 had significantly lower yield comparing to the standard (38. 100 kg/ha) ...|$|E
40|$|Surgical {{instrument}} processing {{is crucial}} for safety, high-quality surgical care but has received a little thought in the medical literature. Typical hospitals have inventories {{in the tens of}} thousands of surgical instruments organized into thousands of instrument sets. The use of these instruments for many procedures per day leads to millions of instrument sets being reprocessed yearly in a single hospital (Blackmore, Bishop, Luker, & Williams, 2013). In this project student are proposing a potential method to provide solution to the problem of errors in the processing of sterile instruments that lead to increased functioning times and costs. Automated Visual Tracking System comprised of a system on which the names and pictures of surgical instruments required for a surgical procedure are selectively displayed for reading the optically readable code mark; and a computer which stores the data about surgical instruments for the surgical procedure. The optically readable <b>code</b> <b>mark</b> on a surgical instrument is read by the reader and inputted into the computer, by which the read and inputted surgical instruments are consecutively identified on a screen, and finally the preparation of surgical instrument sets can be prepared. Development of Visual Tracking System for Surgical Instrument is to help to minimize problems that may arise in tracking instruments and to make the management become more efficient. Detection system equipment can then be used to set up a database of information about where each piece of equipment is in the right location. In particular, readers are actively or passively can provide information concerning the completeness of whether the detection system center or remotely via the electrical wiring of the existing or via a network or other system that can carry any information (Black, 1999) using a bar code requires labor -intensive steps to visit the facility with one or more mobile scanner...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} a mechatronic system, designed and {{developed for the}} forest industry, to trace logs from forest to sawmill. The research is {{a key part of}} a large research project launched by the EU in 2006 called the Indisputable Key project. Wood waste during harvesting, transportation and refinement is a major concern for the wood industry worldwide. Some raw materials are not suited for specific end products, and acknowledging this late in the wood value chain is cost inefficient. Pinpointing specific raw material suitable for a particular end product could increase quality, reduce waste and environmental impact; to accomplish this, traceability is essential. To trace the raw material of a final wood product to its origin, marking and reading of the different specimens must occur at each refining stage in the wood value chain. The traceability chain can be divided into three main stages: forest to sawmill, inside the sawmill, and from sawmill to second manufacturer. The research presented here covers {{the first part of the}} wood value chain, namely, forest to sawmill. In Scandinavian countries, logs are cut to length in the forest using a harvester machine. To trace logs, a unique identity code needs to be associated with each log at harvesting time in the forest and detected before further processing at the sawmill. Earlier research using RFID transponders as code carriers have been functionally verified but too costly. Although the cost of RFID transponders is declining, alternative methods are considered a necessity. This constitutes the main driver behind this thesis. The thesis presents a promising alternative log marking method comprising a harvester saw-integrated log code printer and a sawmill code detection system. An identity code in the form of a standard matrix code is applied via the harvester saw bar during cutting. A prototype has been designed and realized and the results point towards a both time and cost efficient solution. The code detection system, to be placed in one or more locations at the sawmill, is based on vision technology and image processing to detect the applied log codes. Both log code marking and reading systems communicate with an ICT system which maintains the traceability database. A major advantage of the system is that both marking and reading is performed without any time-loss and hence do not disturb the high pace production flow in todays forestry. Also, the item cost of each <b>code</b> <b>mark</b> is very low, compared to e. g. a transponder. The marking technology is patent pending. A field test was performed in December 2009 in northern Sweden. A test batch of 320 logs was marked and read. Two code structures (i. e., matrix and barcode) were applied, where 210 barcoded logs were used to demonstrate log traceability between forest and sawmill. This result indicates that this technology has potential. The prototype is not intended for commercial use, but serves merely to demonstrate the potential of the method; further research is needed to improve its functionality. QC 2011051...|$|E
