25|$|The best {{treatment}} for <b>cutaneous</b> <b>leishmaniasis</b> is not known.

In the setting of a developing country, there is often only one species present in a particular locality, so it is usually unnecessary to speciate every infection. Unfortunately, leishmaniasis is an orphan disease in developed nations, and almost all the current treatment options are toxic with significant side effects.

40|$|Acesso restrito: Texto completo. p. 1344 - 1353. Tumor {{necrosis}} factor-α (TNF-α) {{is known}} to have numerous biological properties relating to inflammation. This cytokine participates in the tissue damage of chronic inflammatory, autoimmune and infectious diseases. Pentoxifylline is a methylxanthine that inhibits phosphodiesterase IV, which inhibits the degradation of the cAMP and prostanoids. The increased intracellular concentration of the cAMP leads to a negative regulation of NF-κB and NF-AT transcription factors and suppresses TNF-α production. This review describes studies that support evidences that TNF-α is involved in the pathogenesis of HTLV- 1 associated myelopathy and of <b>cutaneous</b> and mucosal <b>leishmaniasis.</b> Additionally, it demonstrates the effect of pentoxifylline in vitro in inhibiting TNF-α and IFN-γ spontaneous production in PBMC from HTLV- 1 -infected patients, as well as its in vivo effect in inhibiting TNF-α in sera from mucosal leishmaniasis patients.

40|$|The gene {{encoding}} type I signal peptidase (Lmjsp) {{has been}} cloned from Leishmania major. Lmjsp encodes a protein of 180 amino residues with a predicted molecular mass of 20. 5 kDa. Comparison of the protein sequence {{with those of}} known type I signal peptidases indicates homology in five conserved domains A-E which {{are known to be}} important, or essential, for catalytic activity. Southern blot hybridisation analysis indicates that there is a single copy of the Lmjsp gene. A recombinant SPase protein and a synthetic peptide of the L. major signal peptidase were used to examine the presence of specific antibodies in sera from either recovered or active individuals of both <b>cutaneous</b> and visceral <b>leishmaniasis.</b> This evaluation demonstrated that sera from cutaneous and visceral forms of leishmaniasis are highly reactive to both the recombinant and synthetic signal peptidase antigens. Therefore, the Leishmania signal peptidase, albeit localised intracellularly, is a significant target of the Leishmania specific immune response and highlights its potential use for serodiagnosis of <b>cutaneous</b> and visceral <b>leishmaniasis...</b>|$|R

25|$|Most {{species of}} Leishmania {{are capable of}} infecting humans and causing <b>cutaneous</b> <b>leishmaniasis.</b> In the New World, these organisms include L. amazonensis, L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, L. lainsoni, L. lindenbergi, L. mexicana, L. naiffi, L. panamensis, L. peruviana, L. shawi, and L. venezuelensis. Old World species that cause <b>cutaneous</b> <b>leishmaniasis</b> include L. aethiopica, L. infantum, L. major, and L. tropica. With the {{exception}} of L. tropica — which is commonly associated with human settlements and therefore {{considered to be an}} anthroponotic species — all of these organisms are zoonotic. As demographic changes occur in developing nations, some species that have traditionally been considered to be zoonotic (e.g., L. panamensis) are becoming primarily human pathogens.|$|E
25|$|The Middle East, in 2016, {{seems to}} be {{experiencing}} {{an increase in the}} <b>cutaneous</b> <b>leishmaniasis</b> disease due to migrants fleeing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Reports of the increase in the disease have surfaced in Turkey, Lebanon, and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{bacterial}} infection (especially with Staphylococcus aureus) is common and may require antibiotics. Clinicians who are unfamiliar with <b>cutaneous</b> <b>leishmaniasis</b> may mistake the lesion for a pure {{bacterial infection}} (especially after isolation of S. aureus from bacterial skin swabs) {{and fail to}} consider the possibility of leishmaniasis.|$|E
40|$|Infections with parasites of {{the genus}} Leishmania lead to a rapid, but {{transient}} activation of natural killer (NK) cells. In mice activation of NK cells requires a toll-like-receptor 9 -dependent stimulation of dendritic cells followed by the production of IL- 12. Although NK cells appear to be non-essential for the ultimate control of <b>cutaneous</b> and visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> and can exhibit immunosuppressive functions, they form {{an important source of}} interferon (IFN) -gamma, which elicits antileishmanial activity in macrophages and helps to pave a protective T helper cell response. In contrast, the cytotoxic activity of NK cells is dispensable because Leishmania-infected myeloid cells are largely resistant to NK-mediated lysis. In human <b>cutaneous</b> and visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> the functional importance of NK cells is suggested by reports demonstrating (a) a direct activation or inhibition of NK cells by Leishmania promastigotes, (b) the suppression of NK cell numbers or activity during chronic, non-healing infections and (c) by the recovery of NK cell activity following treatment. This review aims to provide an integrated view on the migration, activation, inhibition, function and therapeutic modulation of NK cells in experimental and human leishmaniasis...|$|R
30|$|Leishmaniasis is {{a disease}} {{striking}} the less developed areas of Southeast Asia, East Africa, and Latin America, {{but it is also}} endemic in several Mediterranean countries. Caused by Leishmania spp, there are three main types of leishmaniasis: visceral or kala-azar, which is the most deadly parasitic disease after malaria, <b>cutaneous,</b> and mucocutaneous. <b>Leishmaniasis</b> is transmitted by the bite of certain species of sand flies from the genus Phlebotomus. The increase of this disease in developed countries is related to immunodepression and the rise of international movements of people due to migration or tourism [9, 41].|$|R

25|$|Some species tend {{to cause}} <b>cutaneous</b> <b>{{leishmaniasis}}</b> (e.g., L. major and L.tropica), whereas some species tend to cause visceral leishmaniasis (e.g., L. infantum and L. donovani), though emerging research (due to high deployment rates of western countries to indigenous areas) is showing these species specific presentation lines are blurring.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} found {{across much of}} Asia, and in the Middle East. Within Afghanistan, {{leishmaniasis}} occurs commonly in Kabul, partly due to bad sanitation and waste left uncollected in streets, allowing parasite-spreading sand flies an environment they find favorable. In Kabul, {{the number of people}} infected was estimated to be at least 200,000, and in three other towns (Herat, Kandahar, and Mazar-i-Sharif) about 70,000 more occurred, according to WHO figures from 2002. Kabul is estimated as the largest center of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>leishmaniasis</b> in the world, with around 67,500 cases as of 2004. Africa, in particular the East and North, is also home to cases of leishmaniasis.|$|E
25|$|For visceral {{leishmaniasis}} in India, South America, and the Mediterranean, liposomal amphotericin B is the recommended treatment {{and is often}} used as a single dose. Rates of cure with a single dose of amphotericin have been reported as 95%. In India, almost all infections are resistant to pentavalent antimonials. In Africa, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin is recommended. These, however, can have significant side effects. Miltefosine, an oral medication, is effective against both visceral and <b>cutaneous</b> <b>leishmaniasis.</b> Side effects are generally mild, though it can cause birth defects if taken within 3 months of getting pregnant.
