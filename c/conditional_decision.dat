40|$|Abstract Recently {{a regular}} (unconditional) {{decision}} {{process has been}} mathematically formulated from the multistage decision process in Bellman and Zadeh's paper "Decision-making in a fuzzy environment". According to the available information on total fuzziness, we propose two types of <b>conditional</b> <b>decision</b> process for regular decision process. One is an "a posteriori <b>conditional</b> <b>decision</b> process " {{and the other is}} an "a priori <b>conditional</b> <b>decision</b> process. " The a posteriori process is formulated through taking at each stage backward conditional expectation of remaining process after performing take-action for the regular decision process. The a priori is through taking at each stage backward conditional expectation before take-action. We derive recursive equations for both a posteriori and a priori processes with numerical illustrations. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} stochastic optimization of {{not necessarily}} additive but recursive functions over multistage decision processes. Without assuming any monotonicity, we optimize a regular process by a direct dynamic programming approach. On the regular decision process, we propose two related <b>conditional</b> <b>decision</b> processes: an a posteriori <b>conditional</b> <b>decision</b> process and an a priori. When the Markov transition law degenerates into a deterministic dynamics, the two conditional processes reduce {{to the same}} deterministic decision process. The conditional processes with monotonicity are optimized by the usual backward dynamic programming. We show that under additional convexity the regular process dominates the a priori in maximum value function and the a priori does the a posteriori. We show that the a posteriori process illustrates Kreps and Porteus's dynamic choice problem. The numerical example also verifies the dominance relation in three optimal value functions...|$|E

To fill this gap, the aim of the current study was to explore qualitative themes in women 2 ̆ 7 s intended behavioral responses to a hypothetical sexual assault threat, date rape, by using a laboratory-controlled threat. College women (N = 139) were randomly assigned to one of four different levels of sexual assault threat presented via an audio-recorded vignette.

Six major themes emerged: assertion, compliance/acceptance, <b>conditional</b> <b>decision</b> making, avoidance, expressions of discomfort, and allusion to future contact. Although almost all participants described assertion, a number of non-assertive responses were described that are not currently recognized in the literature.

40|$|Asset {{allocation}} {{decisions are}} critical for investors with diversiåed portfolios. Institutional investors must manage their strategic asset mix over time to achieve favorable returns subject to various uncertainties, policy and legal constraints, and other requirements. In {{order to determine the}} asset mix explicitly, we can use a multi-period portfolio optimization model. The notion of scenarios is typically employed for modeling random parameters in the multi-period stochastic programming(MSP) model, and the path of uncertainties is revealed as a scenario tree. On the other hand, a simulated path model is proposed and formulated as a linear programming model by Hibiki[4, 5]. The path of uncertainties is revealed as simulated paths associated with any stochastic process, and we can get a better accuracy of uncertainties by using simulated paths rather than a scenario tree. Two kinds of stochas-tic optimization models involve trading oã the appropriate decisions and the accuracy of uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a hybrid optimization model by using simulated paths and decision tree in order to do both describing the accuracy of uncertainties and making the <b>conditional</b> <b>decisions.</b> We have sample paths associated with asset returns using Monte Carlo simulation as used in the simulated path model, while we allow the model to expand the decision space and to make the <b>conditional</b> <b>decisions</b> as used in the scenario tree model.

A fundamental issue {{in this context is}} to maintain risk under control while achieving the desired return targets. When the asset mix is to be re-balanced many times over the investment horizon, the decision maker faces a rather difficult constrained dynamic optimization problem that should take into account <b>conditional</b> <b>decisions</b> based on future market behavior. This problem is usually solved approximately using scenario-based stochastic programming: a technique that suffers from serious problems of numerical complexity due to the intrinsic combinatorial nature of scenario trees. In this paper, we present a novel and computationally efficient approach to constrained discrete-time dynamic asset allocation over multiple periods. This technique is able to control portfolio expectation and variance at both final and intermediate stages of the decision horizon, and may account for proportional transaction costs and intertemporal dependence of the return process. A key feature of the proposed method is the introduction of a linearly-parameterized class of feedback reaction functions, which permits to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the portfolio statistics over time.

In the theoretical section, a formal model of the impact of self-fulfilling prophecies on educational transitions is developed. In the empirical section, we test this model to predict both students' educational success (in terms of high school graduation) and their university transitions. Since we assume a conditional dependence of these outcomes, we control for sample selection bias (Heckman, 1979). We find that in our operationalization of self-fulfilling prophecies the latter show significant effects on both educational success and university transitions. However, while the results remain stable in case of educational success, we find that the <b>conditional</b> <b>decision</b> problem of university transitions leads to a selection bias for the estimates in the latter case.
