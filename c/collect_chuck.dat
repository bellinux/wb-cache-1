40|$|Surface {{quality of}} optical glass is crucial for {{application}} in high precision products. This paper aim to investigate the surface roughness improvement and the limit surface roughness of the BK 7 optical glass for mirror-like surface finish. Due to the brittleness of workpiece, lapping pressure need to be controlled diligently to prevent crack and brittle fracture from occurring. At first, the new lapping tool is installed on the <b>collect</b> <b>chuck</b> of the CNC milling machine and lapping is performed by the table movement in X and Y direction by NC control. Then, suitable lapping parameters are carefully selected for ductile mode machining in mirror-like finishing process. According to results, the mirror-like surface is achievd with proposed lapping method especially in low lapping pressure of 25 MPa...|$|E

5000|$|The station sends {{a convoy}} of news {{helicopters}} to evacuate the shelter, one of which <b>collects</b> <b>Chuck</b> from the hotel roof and drops him at the shelter. Stacey brings a sleeping Katey to the helicopter, but Katey's bag, containing her mother's possessions, is accidentally dropped by the elevator. Chuck goes to grab it, but is ambushed by the zombiefied TK and several other zombies. He throws the bag to Stacey, and tells her {{to take care of}} Katey as he is dragged into the elevator. The epilogue states the city is bombed, but Chuck is cleared of his accused involvement in the outbreak and is praised as a hero. However, Phenotrans shares rise in price, and Chuck's fate is unknown. This ending is a canon ending to Dead Rising 2: Case West in the intro where Frank West finds Chuck almost being bitten by the zombie TK and rescues him.|$|R
