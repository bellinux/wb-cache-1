6000|$|But we did {{not spend}} all our spare time in talking. An hour or two, every evening was {{occupied}} in what we called [...] "fixing the house," [...] and gradually the inside of our abode began {{to look like a}} <b>conventional</b> <b>dwelling.</b> We put matting on the floors and cheap but very pretty paper on the walls. We added now a couple of chairs, and now a table or something for the kitchen. Frequently, especially of a Sunday, we had company, and our guests were always charmed with Euphemia's cunning little meals. The dear girl loved good eating so much that she could scarcely fail to be a good cook.|$|E
40|$|Static {{and dynamic}} load {{response}} test results for a low profile, timber framed, plywood sheathed floor system {{suitable for use}} in <b>conventional</b> <b>dwelling</b> construction are presented. These results are compared to those obtained for a standard bearer/joist floor having similar material of construction and identical geometric layout. This work constitutes the first stage {{in the development of}} an engineered whole house designed to economically and efficiently resist forces produced by high winds...|$|E
40|$|Radiant floor heating has {{received}} increasing attention {{due to its}} diverse advantages, especially the energy saving {{as compared to the}} <b>conventional</b> <b>dwelling</b> heating system. This paper presents a numerical investigation of airflow and heat transfer in the slot-vented room with the radiant floor heating unit. Combination of fluid convection and thermal radiation has been implemented through the thermal boundary conditions. Spatial distributions of indoor air temperature and velocity, as well as the heat transfer rates along the radiant floor and the outer wall, have been presented and analyzed covering the domains from complete natural convection to forced convection dominated flows. The numerical results demonstrate that the levels of average temperature in the room with lateral slot-ventilation are higher than those without slot-ventilation, but lower than those in the room with ceiling slot-ventilation. Overall, the slot-ventilation room with radiant floor heating unit could offer better indoor air quality through increasing the indoor air temperature and fresh air exchanging rate simultaneously. Concerning the airborne pollutant transports and moisture condensations, the performance of radiant floor heating unit will be further optimized in our future researches...|$|E
5000|$|The {{final results}} of the 2011 census {{recorded}} Kosovo excluding North Kosovo as having 1,739,825 inhabitants. ECMI [...] "calls for caution when referring to the 2011 census", due to the boycott by Serb-majority municipalities in North Kosovo and the partial boycott by Serb and Roma in southern Kosovo. The total population number was below most previous estimates. The census enjoyed considerable technical assistance from international agencies and {{appears to have been}} endorsed by Eurostat; it was, however, the first full census since 1981, and not one of an uninterrupted series. The results show that there were no people temporarily resident in hotels or refugee camps {{at the time of the}} census; that out of 312,711 <b>conventional</b> <b>dwellings,</b> 99,808 (over 30%) were unoccupied; and that three municipalities designed under the Ahtisaari Plan - Klokot, Novo Brdo, and Å trpce to have Serb majorities in fact had ethnic Albanian majorities (although their municipal assemblies have Serb majorities).|$|R
40|$|Indoor radon and {{thoron progeny}} Equilibrium Equivalent Concentrations (EEC) were {{measured}} with a portable 'Radon Sniffer' in 10 rammed earth <b>dwellings</b> and 10 <b>conventional</b> <b>dwellings</b> in Margaret River in the South West of Western Australia. Natural background gamma radiation was also measured within the dwellings. The {{results of this study}} show that the mean indoor radon progeny concentrations in rammed earth and non-rammed earth dwellings was 24 Bq m- 3 EEC and 9. 3 Bq m- 3 EEC respectively. The mean indoor thoron progeny concentrations in rammed earth and non-rammed earth dwellings was 3. 9 Bq m- 3 EEC and 0. 8 Bq m- 3 EEC respectively. The ranges of combined indoor radon and thoron progeny concentrations in rammed earth and non-rammed earth dwellings were between 2. 1 and 76 Bq m- 3 EEC and 2. 0 and 27 Bq m- 3 EEC respectively. The mean annual effective radiation dose equivalents from combined indoor radon and thoron progeny concentrations EEC using UNSCEAR's (1982) conversion factors in rammed earth and non-rammed earth dwellings were 4. 1 mSv y- 1 and 2. 2 mSv y- 1 respectively...|$|R
5000|$|Phase 6 (Level 2) {{probably}} {{began in}} AD 1400 or later. By {{this time the}} southern Christian kingdoms of Makouria and Alwa had been overrun by nomad invaders and disappeared. In the north Nobadia survived as a splinter kingdom, saved from nomad invasion by the total lack of pasturage in the surrounding desert. The one surviving building was a massive mud brick [...] "castle-house with high vaulted chambers," [...] originally two stories high though the upper story was mostly cleared off in the nineteenth century. It was {{one of more than}} a dozen similar buildings erected in the area at and beyond the Second Nile Cataract, at the end of the middle ages. Living arrangements, including toilets, were on the upper floor, while those below were designed entirely for the safe storage of goods. A peculiarity of all these structures was that some (sometimes all) of the ground-floor rooms had no lateral entrances; they could be entered only through the roof. The [...] "castle-houses" [...] were long supposed to be of Ottoman origin, but the specimen at Meinarti bore a greek inscription with the names MIXAEL RAPHAEL GABRIEL running in a repeating succession around the walls of one room, clearly attesting a Christian origin. The building and more others like it had however remained in use well into the Ottoman period. Nearly all the [...] "castle-houses" [...] were built on islands, presumably for added security. At all other sites except Meinarti they were accompanied by more <b>conventional</b> <b>dwellings,</b> which must surely have been the case at Meinarti although none survived. This was the topmost level of the mound, and was subject to continual wind erosion and slumpage.|$|R
40|$|The current {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with {{a case study of}} a residential house, located in Ireland, which has been recently retrofitted from a <b>conventional</b> mixed fuel <b>dwelling</b> to a smart grid enabled all-electric dwelling. The aim of the specific case study is to examine the im- pact on the building retrofit measures on the dwelling carbon footprint, pre- and post- retrofit. The analy- sis was carried out using EnergyPlus. The baseline for the case study is the pre-retrofitted dwelling which was based on a mixture of energy supply sources including: fossil fuel for space heating, electricity for household equipment and a conventional gasoline car for trans- portation. Following the retrofit measures, space heat- ing is provided by a ground source heat pump and transportation by an electric vehicle. Other retrofit measures include the installation of PV electric pan- els, heat recovery ventilation and increase in thermal energy storage capabilities. The retrofit measures were found to provide an overall reduction in carbon foot- print from 43. 3 to 30. 8 kg/m 2 CO 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{mobile home}} of {{today is a}} far {{different}} creature than that from which it was bred. Changes in size, appearance, safety, convenience, and desirability {{as a place to}} live have caused the modem mobile home to bear little resemblance to its ancestors. Functioning as a permanently emplaced dwelling, the mobile home has come to be recognized as undeserving of the label "mobile. " Other than by place of manufacture, mobile homes have become increasingly indistinguishable from <b>conventional</b> single family <b>dwellings,</b> raising the question of whether mobile homes can reasonably be restricted from areas reserved for single family dwellings. Land controls, both public, in the form of zoning restrictions, and private, in the form of restrictive covenants, commonly operate to exclude mobile homes from single family residential districts. This note will examine whether mobile homes are distinguishable from site-built homes for the purpose of restrictions imposed by zoning ordinances and restrictive covenants and will explore the analysis required to make such a distinction. This note will conclude that only where a mobile home fails to compare favorably with the other dwellings that could be erected on the site can it be reasonably restricted from a site in a single family residential neighborhood...|$|R
