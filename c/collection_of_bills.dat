2500|$|As the Civil Rights Movement {{developed}} during the postwar era, Tucker came to have {{a central role in}} its legal battles in Virginia. He ultimately filed suits in nearly 50 counties, including Alexandria and neighboring Arlington and Fairfax. By the time Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954 and 1955, the NAACP state legal staff had grown to a dozen cooperating attorneys (including Tucker), and had filed fifteen petitions requesting desegregation with local school boards by the spring of 1956. However, U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd had vowed Massive Resistance to school desegregation, and that fall a special session of the Virginia General Assembly adopted (and Governor Thomas B. Stanley signed) a package of new laws to maintain segregation and close desegregating schools, which {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Stanley plan."

An evaluation of an earlier project for the renewal and expansion of drinking water supply systems in eight provincial towns in Yemen (Bajil, Bait al Faqih, Al Mansouria, Zabid, Mokha, Amran, Yarim und Hajjah), and sanitation measures in three towns (Hajjah, Amran and Yarim) showed that the project largely achieved its objectives related to water supply. The quality of the construction work was rated as high and the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> was considered to be [...] "efficient". However, in Yarim the objective was not achieved due to water shortages. Only [...] "modest improvements" [...] were achieved regarding waste water disposal. Another project to reduce water losses in Taiz and Mukalla was considered a partial failure: On the positive side, the evaluation showed that losses in the rehabilitated areas were reduced significantly. In Mukalla, where 40% of the network was rehabilitated, they were reduced from 22% to 8%. In Taiz, where only 12% of the network was rehabilitated, they fell from 45% to 6%. However, overall losses in the cities remained high at 30% in Mukalla and 47% in Taiz, because only parts of the network were rehabilitated. The cost of the measures was higher than expected due to the poorer than expected state of the network. KfW is now in the process of applying robust, quantitative-based evaluation methods to more accurately assess the health impact of the interventions it supported in Yemeni towns based. This will be done through surveys including both beneficiaries and a control group.|$|E

40|$|The {{suburban}} villa rose {{to prominence}} in the eighteenth century. Burlington, Pope and others built large houses {{on the outskirts of}} London as expressions of their wealth and taste, using them to showcase collections, entertain friends or escape from the gaze of the city. Many others acquired rather more modest houses which they used as a convenient and comfortable base for engaging in London life. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these smaller villas have attracted relatively little attention: overshadowed by the grandeur of their rural, and the showiness of their metropolitan, counterparts they contained few artistic treasures or architectural innovations. Yet they were an important element of elite life and material culture. This paper explores one such house in detail: Grove House in Kensington Gore, the property of the Honourable Mary Leigh. Drawing on a large <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>bills,</b> I examine the processes of decorating, furnishing and supplying Grove House {{around the turn of the}} nineteenth century. This provides insights into the operation of the suburban villa and the ways in which its material culture and habitation were linked to its country equivalent...|$|E
40|$|The English elite {{have long}} drawn {{inspiration}} from contemporary and historical cultures in mainland Europe, most notably Italy and France. These influences were sometimes mediated by British architects and craftsmen, but wealthy landowners also acquired goods {{directly from the}} Continent, sometimes {{in the form of}} collecting on the Grand Tour and sometimes through shopping trips to Paris. These consumption practices have received considerable attention, but there has been little attempt to question {{the extent to which they}} spread beyond a metropolitan-oriented elite or to explore what happened when direct supplies from the Continent (and especially France) were disrupted by political tension or outright war. This paper takes a case study approach, examining the furnishing of Stoneleigh Abbey in Warwickshire through the Hanoverian period. It draws on a rich <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> to assess the network of craftsmen and retailers who supplied the house: who were they and what were their credentials? It also examines the character of the furnishings supplied, not to provide a detailed furniture history, but rather to explore the style and quality of the goods: to what extent was the material culture of this English country house truly English? These questions have much wider implications, of course, for the construction of English identity and culture through the long eighteenth century...|$|E
