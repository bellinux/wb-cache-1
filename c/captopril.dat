5|$|Drug-induced {{psoriasis}} {{may occur}} with beta blockers, lithium, antimalarial medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, terbinafine, calcium channel blockers, <b>captopril,</b> glyburide, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukins, interferons, lipid-lowering drugs, and paradoxically TNF inhibitors such as infliximab or adalimumab. Withdrawal of corticosteroids (topical steroid cream) can aggravate psoriasis {{due to the}} rebound effect.|$|E
5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, Helicobacter pylori, measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and <b>captopril,</b> anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Captopril</b> gained FDA {{approval}} on April 6, 1981. The drug {{became a}} generic {{medicine in the}} U.S. in February 1996, when the market exclusivity held by Bristol-Myers Squibb for <b>captopril</b> expired.|$|E
25|$|Rash {{and taste}} disturbances, {{infrequent}} with most ACE inhibitors, are {{more prevalent in}} <b>captopril,</b> and this is attributed to its sulfhydryl moiety. This has led to decreased use of <b>captopril</b> in clinical setting, although it is still used in scintigraphy of the kidney.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of ACE inhibitors, <b>captopril</b> is not administered as a prodrug (the only other being lisinopril). About 70% of orally administered <b>captopril</b> is absorbed. Bioavailability is reduced by presence of food in stomach. It is partly metabolised and partly excreted unchanged in urine.|$|E
25|$|The adverse drug {{reaction}} (ADR) {{profile of}} <b>captopril</b> is similar to other ACE inhibitors, with cough being the most common ADR. However, <b>captopril</b> is also commonly associated with rash and taste disturbances (metallic or loss of taste), which are attributed to the unique thiol moiety.|$|E
25|$|<b>Captopril</b> (as other ACE inhibitors) {{overdose}} can be antagonized with naloxone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Captopril</b> was {{discovered}} in 1977. It was the first ACE inhibitor developed and was considered a breakthrough both because of its novel mechanism of action and {{also because of the}} revolutionary development process. <b>Captopril</b> {{was discovered}} and developed at E. R. Squibb & Sons Pharmaceuticals based on concepts pioneered by Nobel Laureate John Vane and is now marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb.|$|E
25|$|Frequently {{prescribed}} ACE inhibitors include benazepril, zofenopril, perindopril, trandolapril, <b>captopril,</b> enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril.|$|E
25|$|All ACE inhibitors {{have similar}} {{antihypertensive}} efficacy when equivalent doses are administered. The main differences lie with <b>captopril,</b> the first ACE inhibitor. <b>Captopril</b> has a shorter duration {{of action and}} an increased incidence of adverse effects. It is also the only ACE inhibitor capable of passing through the blood–brain barrier, although {{the significance of this}} characteristic has not been shown to have any positive clinical effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of <b>captopril</b> {{was among the}} earliest successes of the revolutionary concept of ligand-based drug design. The renin-angiontensin-aldosterone system had been extensively studied in the mid-20th century, and this system presented several opportune targets in the {{development of}} novel treatments for hypertension. The first two targets that were attempted were renin and ACE. <b>Captopril</b> was the culmination of efforts by Squibb's laboratories to develop an ACE inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{investigated}} {{for use in the}} treatment of cancer. <b>Captopril</b> stereoisomers were also reported to inhibit some metallo-β-lactamases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Captopril</b> {{also has}} a {{relatively}} poor pharmacokinetic profile. The short half-life necessitates {{two or three times}} per day dosing, which may reduce patient compliance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Captopril,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Capoten, is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) {{inhibitor}} {{used for the}} treatment of hypertension and some types of congestive heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} <b>captopril</b> include cough due to {{increase}} in the plasma levels of bradykinin, angioedema, agranulocytosis, proteinuria, hyperkalemia, taste alteration, teratogenicity, postural hypotension, acute renal failure, and leukopenia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Captopril</b> was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1981. The first nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, enalapril, was marketed two years later. At least 12 other ACE inhibitors have since been marketed.|$|E
25|$|Because of saralasin, {{the first}} Ang II antagonist, and the {{development}} of the first ACE inhibitor <b>captopril,</b> it was generally acknowledged that Ang II receptor antagonists might be promising as effective antihypertensive agents.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of <b>captopril</b> has been claimed as {{an instance of}} 'biopiracy' (commercialization of traditional medicines), since no benefits have flowed back to the indigenous Brazilian tribe who first used pit viper venom as an arrowhead poison.|$|E
25|$|A {{chemical}} synthesis of <b>captopril</b> by treatment of L-proline with (2S)-3-acetylthio-2-methylpropanoyl chloride under basic conditions (NaOH), followed by aminolysis of the protective acetyl group to unmask the drug's free thiol, {{is depicted in}} the figure at right.|$|E
25|$|<b>Captopril</b> was {{developed}} in 1975 by three researchers at the U.S. drug company Squibb (now Bristol-Myers Squibb): Miguel Ondetti, Bernard Rubin, and David Cushman. Squibb filed for U.S. patent protection on the drug in February 1976 and U.S. Patent 4,046,889 was granted in September 1977.|$|E
25|$|The {{adverse effect}} and {{pharmacokinetic}} limitations of <b>captopril</b> stimulated {{the development of}} enalapril and subsequent ACE inhibitors. These were specifically designed to lack the sulfhydryl moiety believed {{to be responsible for}} rash and taste disturbance. Most subsequent ACE inhibitors are given as prodrugs, to improve oral bioavailability. All have longer half-lives and are given once or twice daily, which may improve patient compliance.|$|E
25|$|Sulfhydryl-containing compounds. The {{metabolism}} {{of organic}} nitrates to nitric oxide {{is dependent on}} the presence of sulfhydryl groups in the muscle. The combination of oral N-acetylcysteine and a single dose of sustained-release isosorbide mononitrate 60nbsp&mg significantly prolonged the total exercise time in patients with angina pectoris and angiographically proven significant coronary artery disease, when compared with isosorbide mononitrate alone. Concomitant administration of other exogenous sources of sulfhydryl groups such as methionine and <b>captopril</b> may produce a similar interaction.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms and Treatment: There are few {{reports of}} ACE {{inhibitor}} overdose in the literature. The most likely manifestations are hypotension, {{which may be}} severe, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia and renal impairment with metabolic acidosis. Treatment should be mainly symptomatic and supportive, with volume expansion using normal saline to correct hypotension and improve renal function, and gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal and a cathartic to prevent further absorption of the drug. <b>Captopril,</b> enalapril, lisinopril and perindopril {{are known to be}} removable by hemodialysis.|$|E
25|$|BPFs {{are members}} of a family of {{peptides}} whose potentiating action is linked to inhibition of bradykinin by ACE. Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF teprotide (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect in vivo. Teprotide had limited clinical value {{as a result of its}} peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally. In the early 1970s, knowledge of the structure-activity relationship required for inhibition of ACE was growing. David Cushman, Miguel Ondetti and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using carboxypeptidase A as a model. Their discoveries led to the development of <b>captopril,</b> the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{a wide variety of}} drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, {{including}} zopiclone, H1-antihistamines, such as azelastine and emedastine. Approximately 250 drugs affect taste. The sodium channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by amiloride, and the creation of new taste buds and saliva can be impeded by antiproliferative drugs. Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include lithium carbonate and tetracyclines. Drugs containing sulfhydryl groups, including penicillamine and <b>captopril,</b> may react with zinc and cause deficiency. Metronidazole and chlorhexidine have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the cell membrane. Drugs that prevent the production of angiotensin II by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme, eprosartan for example, have been linked to dysgeusia. There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine also cause dysguesia by blocking calcium sensitive taste buds.|$|E
500|$|For {{women with}} {{injuries}} above T6, a risk during labor and delivery that threatens {{both mother and}} fetus is autonomic dysreflexia, in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke. Drugs such as nifedipine and <b>captopril</b> {{can be used to}} manage an episode if it occurs, and epidural anesthesia helps although it is not very reliable in women with SCI. [...] Anesthesia is used for labor and delivery even for women without sensation, who may only experience contractions as abdominal discomfort, increased spasticity, and episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. Reduced sensation in the pelvic area means women with SCI usually have less painful delivery; in fact, they may fail to realize when they go into labor. If there are deformities in the pelvis or spine caesarian section may be necessary. Babies of women with SCI {{are more likely to be}} born prematurely, and, premature or not, they are more likely to be small for their gestational time.|$|E
2500|$|A {{class of}} drugs widely used to lower {{cholesterol}} are the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, for example atorvastatin. [...] These were developed from mevastatin, a polyketide {{produced by the}} fungus Penicillium citrinum. [...] Finally, a number natural product drugs are used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. [...] These include the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor <b>captopril.</b> [...] <b>Captopril</b> {{is based on the}} peptidic [...] bradykinin potentiating factor [...] isolated from venom of the Brazilian arrowhead viper (Bothrops jararaca).|$|E
2500|$|Except for {{postural}} hypotension, {{which occurs}} due to short and fast {{mode of action}} of <b>captopril,</b> most of the side effects mentioned are common for all ACE inhibitors. Among these, cough {{is the most common}} adverse effect. Hyperkalemia can occur, especially if used with other drugs which elevate potassium level in blood, such as potassium-sparing diuretics. Other side effects are: ...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{of these}} {{specific}} chemical-target interactions, venom constituents have proved important tools for studying receptors, ion channels, and enzymes. [...] In some cases, {{they have also}} served as leads {{in the development of}} novel drugs. [...] For example, teprotide, a peptide isolated from the venom of the Brazilian pit viper Bothrops jararaca, was a lead {{in the development of the}} antihypertensive agents cilazapril and <b>captopril.</b> [...] Also, echistatin, a disintegrin from the venom of the saw-scaled viper Echis carinatus was a lead in the development of the antiplatelet drug tirofiban.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, using {{bradykinin}} potentiating factor (BPF) {{provided by}} Sergio Ferreira, Ng and Vane found {{the conversion of}} angiotensin I to angiotensin II was inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation. BPF was later {{found to be a}} peptide in the venom of a lancehead viper (Bothrops jararaca), which was a “collected-product inhibitor” of [...] the converting enzyme. [...] <b>Captopril</b> was developed from this peptide after it was found via QSAR-based modification that the terminal sulfhydryl moiety of the peptide provided a high potency of ACE inhibition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Captopril</b> gained FDA {{approval}} on April 6, 1981. The drug {{became a}} generic {{medicine in the}} U.S. in February 1996, when the market exclusivity held by Bristol-Myers Squibb for <b>captopril</b> expired.|$|E
50|$|The {{selection}} of long-acting active ingredients over short-acting ones may also reduce pill burden. For instance, ACE inhibitors {{are used in}} the management of hypertension. Both <b>captopril</b> and lisinopril are examples of ACE inhibitors. However, lisinopril is dosed once a day, whereas <b>captopril</b> may be dosed 2-3 times a day. Assuming that there are no contraindications or potential for drug interactions, using lisinopril instead of <b>captopril</b> may be an appropriate way to limit pill burden.|$|E
50|$|The <b>captopril</b> {{suppression}} test (CST) is a non-invasive {{medical test}} that measures plasma levels of aldosterone.Aldosterone production is suppressed by <b>captopril</b> through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. CST results {{are used to}} assist in the diagnososis of primary aldosteronism (Conn Syndrome).|$|E
50|$|Rash {{and taste}} disturbances, {{infrequent}} with most ACE inhibitors, are {{more prevalent in}} <b>captopril,</b> and this is attributed to its sulfhydryl moiety. This has led to decreased use of <b>captopril</b> in clinical setting, although it is still used in scintigraphy of the kidney.|$|E
50|$|The adverse drug {{reaction}} (ADR) {{profile of}} <b>captopril</b> is similar to other ACE inhibitors, with cough being the most common ADR. However, <b>captopril</b> is also commonly associated with rash and taste disturbances (metallic or loss of taste), which are attributed to the unique thiol moiety.|$|E
50|$|Plasma {{concentration}} of renin is measured {{prior to and}} following the administration of <b>captopril.</b> The CCT is considered positive if the renin levels increase substantially or the baseline renin level is abnormally high. An abnormal <b>captopril</b> test {{is indicative of the}} presence of renovascular disease.|$|E
