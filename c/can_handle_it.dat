The song builds into a crescendo as Madonna sings the line, [...] "If it's against the law, arrest me, if you <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it,</b> undress me". This is followed by synthesized musical arrangement, as Madonna starts singing the line, [...] "When the lights go down and there's no one left, I can {{go on and on and}} on." [...] An interlude, where Madonna continuously chants the words [...] "Get Stupid", is also present. According to Miles Marshall Lewis of The Village Voice, the song contains elements of the work of Nile Rodgers.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Give It 2 Me", the album's second single, Madonna merged bounce-beats and a funky bassline. [...] "If it's {{against the}} law, arrest me", she sings [...] "If you <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it,</b> undress me." [...] The song has a short {{interlude}} where Madonna continuously repeates the words [...] "Get stupid", as Williams chants, [...] "To the left, to the right". [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] {{was written by}} Madonna as an anthemic, self-manifesto song which, although {{it appears to be}} about dance and sex, is a reference to Madonna's career spanning three decades in the music industry. Musically it is an upbeat dance song, featuring instrumentation from West African percussion and cowbells. Backing vocals are provided by Williams. The fourth track [...] "Heartbeat" [...] has Madonna singing breathlessly and also features an interlude where the music changes from its normal rhythm, just the sound of drums.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins in}} a room with a man named Fuzz (Polow da Don) telling B.B. (Hilson) and her gun-slinging women crew {{consisting}} of Boots (JoJo), Danja (Evans), and Money (Dawn Richard) about bringing in Hilson's boyfriend into custody. After Hilson assures Jammal that she <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it,</b> the song begins and Hilson are seen wearing outfits of black bikinis as they dance seductively to the song's chorus and verse. Meanwhile, Hilson and her crew are back in the room preparing themselves with scenes of Hilson grinding against a large vault door. As the song moves to the pre-chorus, Hilson and her crew are shown at a party, mingling with the male guests and handing them drinks. As Ross' verse begins, he, Short and da Don are shown at the party as Hilson's crew grind themselves around them and Hilson kisses Short's head. The song pauses and Hilson and her crew move into a room with Polow da Don, Short, and Ross sitting in chair with other men in the background. Unexpectedly, her crew all pull out their guns. Short (who {{has turned out to be}} Hilson's target) is able to respond almost immediately by having his men pull out their guns. Seeing they are evenly matched, Short agrees to let Hilson take him into custody, with Hilson removing her top and locking them both in handcuffs. The two walk upstairs, where Short pushes Hilson against the wall and they kiss on the stairway. The video ends with Short following Hilson upstairs while the words [...] "To be continued..." [...] appear on the screen.|$|E

2500|$|Decoding, on {{the other}} hand, is {{carefully}} defined in the standard. Most decoders are [...] "bitstream compliant", {{which means that the}} decompressed output that they produce from a given MP3 file will be the same, within a specified degree of rounding tolerance, as the output specified mathematically in the ISO/IEC high standard document (ISO/IEC 11172-3). Therefore, comparison of decoders is usually based on how computationally efficient they are (i.e., how much memory or CPU time they use in the decoding process). Over time this concern has become less of an issue as CPU speeds transitioned from MHz to GHz. Encoder/decoder overall delay is not defined, which means there is no official provision for gapless playback. However, some encoders such as LAME can attach additional metadata that will allow players that <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it</b> to deliver seamless playback.|$|E

40|$|Multi-class {{problem is}} the class of {{problems}} having more than one classes in the data set. Bayesian Network (BN) is a well-known algorithm handling the multi-class problem and is applied to different areas. But BN cannot handle continuous values. In contrast, Genetic Programming (GP) <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> continuous values and produces classification rules. However, GP is possible to produce cyclic rules representing tautologic, in which are useless for inference and expert systems. Co-evolutionary Rule-chaining Genetic Programming (CRGP) is the first variant of GP handling the multi-class problem and produces acyclic classification rules [16]. It employs backward chaining inference to carry out classification based on the acquired acyclic rule set. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> multi-classes; <b>it</b> <b>can</b> avoid cyclic rules; <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> input attributes with continuous values; and it can learn complex relationships among the attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, the Chaining Genetic Programming (CGP) learning a set of acyclic rules and to produce better results than the CRGP’s. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has the shorter learning process and can produce more accurate acyclic classification rules. ...|$|R

The exception causes the current scope to be exited, and also each outer scope (propagation) until a suitable handler is found, calling in turn the destructors of any objects in these exited scopes. At the same time, an exception is presented as an object carrying the data about the detected problem.|$|R
