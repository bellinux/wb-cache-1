40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} set of output stable {{configurations}} of chemical reaction deciders (CRDs). It turns out that CRDs with only bimolecular reactions (which are almost equivalent to population protocols) have a special structure that allows for an algorithm to efficiently calculate the (finite) set of minimal output stable configurations. As a consequence, a relatively large sequence of configurations may be efficiently checked for output stability. We also provide a number of observations regarding the semilinearity result of Angluin et al. [Distrib. Comput., 2007] from the context of population protocols (which is a central result for output stable CRDs). In particular, we observe that the computation-friendly class of totally stable CRDs has equal expressive power as the larger <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b> stable CRDs. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} real time trajectory generation and tracking for nonlinear control systems. We employ a two degree of freedom approach that separates the nonlinear tracking problem into real time trajectory generation followed by local (gain-scheduled) stabilization. The central problem which we consider is how to generate, possibly with some delay, a feasible state space and input trajectory in real time from an output trajectory that is given online. We propose two algorithms that solve the real time trajectory generation problem for differentially flat systems with (possibly non-minimum phase) zero dynamics. One is based on receding horizon point to point steering, the other allows additional minimization of a cost function.

The typechecking problem is parameterized by the class of formulas dening the transformation, the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b> tree languages, and the class of integrity constraints. While undecidable in its most general formulation, the typechecking problem has many special cases of practical interest that turn out to be decidable.

In the decidable cases we examine the complexity, and show lower and upper bounds. We also exhibit a practically appealing restriction for which typechecking is in ptime. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{presents}} a unifying {{framework for the}} problem of robust global regulation via output feedback for nonlinear systems with integral input-to-state stable (iISS) inverse dynamics, subject to possibly unknown control direction. The contribution of the paper is two-fold. Firstly, we consider the problem of global regulation, instead of global asymptotic stabilization (GAS), for systems with generalized dynamic uncertainties. It is shown by an elementary example that GAS is not solvable using conventional smooth output feedback. Sec-ondly, we reduce the stability requirements for the disturbance and demand relaxed assumptions for the system. Using our framework, most <b>of</b> the known <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b> feedback form systems are broadened in several directions: unmeasured states and unknown parameters can appear non-linearly, restrictive matching and growth assumptions are removed, the dynamic uncertainty satisfies the weaker condition of Sontag's integral input-to-state stability, and the sign of high-frequency gain may be unknown. A constructive strategy is proposed to design a dynamic output feedback control law, that drives the state to the origin while keeping all other closed-loop signals bounded. I...|$|R
40|$|A <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b> {{feedback}} controllers {{capable of}} reducing parameter sensitivities and rejecting disturbances and parameter variations is investigated in this thesis. The methodology uses piecewise continous output feedback controllers, generating a sliding output trajectory along a switching manifold in the output space. Variable structure output feedback controllers are developed which guarantee stability of all motions {{of a class}} of linear time-invariant systems. Two coordinate transformations are used which makes the design procedure easier to implement. New switching surface design algorithm based on eigenvectors assignment technique is presented. Besides using the output variables, the output feedback controllers presented in this thesis ensure minimum chattering effect during sliding. This is because the control gains of the switched part may be chosen relatively small. ^ In order to demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} presented results, and to compare the obtained results with the existing ones, the design method is applied to a chemical process and to a power system. The power system is represented by a single machine connected to an infinite bus. The control design method used in the chemical process problem serves as an intermediate step between state variable structure control and output variables variable structure control since the design process utilizes only the available outputs of the plant. ...|$|E

This {{can be viewed}} {{as an extension of the}} H∞ optimal control problem, where the transmission from the plant output sensors to the controller, and from the controller to the plant are over sporadically failing channels. We consider two different scenarios for unreliable communication. The first one is where the communication channel provides perfect acknowledgments of successful transmissions of control packets through a clean reverse channel, that is the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Under this setting, we obtain a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b> feedback minimax controllers; we identify a set of explicit threshold-type existence conditions in terms of the H∞ disturbance attenuation parameter and the packet loss rates that guarantee stability and performance of the closed-loop system. The second scenario is one where there is no acknowledgment of successful transmissions of control packets, that is the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). We consider a special case of this problem where there is no measurement noise in the transmission from the sensors. For this problem, we obtain a class of corresponding minimax controllers by characterizing a set of (different) existence conditions.

To examine this possibility, we compared the odor-evoked responses of identified single units recorded in the mitral cell layer (MCL units), {{in the core of}} the external plexiform layer (not at the glomerular border tufted cells), or at the glomerular border of this layer (GB tufted cells) of the entire olfactory bulb. Differences between mitral and tufted cells were observed only when subtle aspects of the responses were explored, such as the firing rate per respiratory cycle or the distribution of firing activity along the respiratory cycle. By contrast, more clear differences were found when the 2 subtypes of tufted cells were examined separately.
