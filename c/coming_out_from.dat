25|$|In 2014, archaeological work in {{the former}} prison grounds led to the {{discovery}} of three rare panopticons (named after Jeremy Bentham’s prison design of 1791) located near the A and B Divisions that were built of bluestone in the 1850s. The first uncovered and excavated was to the north of A division and was built of bluestone in the 1850s. The circular design, with walls <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the centre, created wedge shaped 'airing yards' where prisoners would be permitted access for one hour per day without coming into contact with each other. The panopticons fell out of use, due to prison overcrowding, and were largely demolished in the early 1900s. The panopticons were based on the design concepts of British philosopher and social reformer Jeremy Bentham. The footings of the first panopticon that was excavated and uncovered is located to the north of A Division and remains relatively intact. The excavation and uncovering of the other two panopticons next to B Division only revealed the remains of its rubble footings.|$|E

500|$|... "Bye Bye Baby" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer and songwriter Madonna, for her fifth studio album Erotica (1992). It was released on November 15, 1993, as the sixth and final single from the album. [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] was written by Madonna, Shep Pettibone, and Anthony Shimkin and was produced by Madonna and Pettibone. The song is inspired by Madonna's emotions of that time and her S thoughts. Musically, it is a hip hop song, sampling a hook from LL Cool J's track [...] "Jingling Baby", released in 1990. Madonna's vocals were filtered to make them appear as sound <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> an antique radio. [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] features instrumentation from keyboard and lyrically finds Madonna asking questions to a lover {{she is about to}} abandon.|$|E
500|$|As Madonna {{finishes}} {{singing the}} intermediate lines, [...] "Close your eyes, sleepy-head, It {{is time for}} your bed, Never forget what I said, Hang on...", a trumpet starts playing alongside the main rhythm.

[...] "Dear Jessie" [...] ends with all instrumentation and vocals fading out, except the orchestra, which is equalized to make it sound very thin and trebly, as if <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> a distorted radio. The lyrics encourage the little girl Jessie to use her imagination. It summons up a psychedelic landscape, where pink elephants roam with dancing moons and mermaids. It references fairy-tale characters and creates an image of children playing with each other.|$|E
500|$|Miralles {{sought to}} design a {{parliament}} building that could represent and present a national identity. This intractably difficult question was tackled by displacing the question of identity into the landscape of Scotland. In a characteristically poetic approach he talked about slotting the building into the land [...] "in {{the form of a}} gathering situation: an amphitheatre, <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> Arthur's Seat." [...] where the building would reflect a dialogue between the landscape and the act of people sitting. So an early goal of the design was to open the building and its public spaces, not just to Edinburgh but to a more general concept of the Scottish landscape. Miralles intended to use the parliament to help build the end of Canongate—"not just another building on the street...it should reinforce the existing qualities of the site and its surroundings. In a subtle game of cross views and political implications." ...|$|E

Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Inna singing in front of a door, and her in a desert with a dromedary and dancing around a fire with her backup dancers. Regarding the singer's appearance in the music video, Yohann Ruelle of Pure Charts wrote, [...] "Inna knows how to turn on the temperature!" [...] Valentina Malfroy from website Aficia commended the quality of the visual and saw Inna as charming. An editor of Vagalume thought Inna [...] "plays a girl who abuses her sensuality in typical costumes and a lot of Arabic dance to enchant her love interest." [...] Currin, writing in his own website, praised Inna's choreography and the video overall, whilst Hitfire recommended the clip and said it matched the song. After its release on YouTube, the music video attracted many comments written in Arabic. It received notable airplay in Romania, peaking at number seven on Media Forest's TV Airplay chart.|$|E
