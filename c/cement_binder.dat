40|$|Cementitious binders {{consisting}} of ground granulated iron slag and an alkaline activator alkali activated slag have considerable environmental benefits when {{used as an}} alternative to conventional 100 % ordinary portland <b>cement</b> <b>binders.</b> The objective {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the effect of pore cross section shape on unsaturated flow and to contrast the laboratory and numerical predictions of alkali activated slag binders and 100 % portland <b>cement</b> <b>binders.</b> Convection-based uptake of water within capillary pores is modeled using pore size distribution data; however, most existing predictive models are based on the assumption of a circular cross section. This model allows for changeable capillary cross sectional shape by employing ellipses ranging in shape from circular to slit. By applying a shape factor that accounts for departure from circularity of the pore cross section, the prediction model shows reasonable agreement with water sorptivity test data. As well as different binder types, the predictive model is assessed over a range of concrete ages and curing conditions...|$|R

40|$|Publicación versión impresa: mayo de 2008 Supercritical {{carbonation}} of Portland <b>cement</b> <b>binders</b> was {{studied to}} analyse {{the influence of}} the type of cement on carbonation at high CO 2 pressures (CO 2 at 20 MPa and 318 K) and to improve the understanding of the effects on the microstructure and physicochemical properties of binders. The results were compared with those obtained in a natural exposure. Microstructural properties of supercritically and atmospherically carbonated Portland <b>cement</b> <b>binders</b> were examined using the complementary analytical techniques of FTIR, TG-DTA, and BSEM-EDX. Supercritically carbonated binders showed a microstructure based on a more polymerized and lower Ca form of CSH gel, formed by decalcification of high-Ca form of CSH gel. Results suggested that during the treatment at artificially intensified conditions, the crystallized calcium carbonate came mainly from the carbonation of the CSH gel, and at atmospheric conditions, from the carbonation of the portlandite phase.

50|$|Sulfates in {{solution}} {{in contact with}} concrete can cause chemical changes to the cement, which can cause significant microstructural effects leading to the weakening of the <b>cement</b> <b>binder</b> (chemical sulfate attack). Sulfate solutions can also cause damage to porous cementitious materials through crystallization and recrystallization (salt attack). Sulfates and sulfites are ubiquitous in the natural environment and are present from many sources, including gypsum (calcium sulfate) often present as an additive in 'blended' cements which include fly ash and other sources of sulfate. With the notable exception of barium sulfate, most sulfates are slightly to highly soluble in water. These include acid rain where sulfur dioxide in the airshed is dissolved in rainfall to produce sulfurous acid. In lightning storms, the dioxide is oxidised to trioxide making the residual sulfuric acid in rainfall even more highly acidic. Local government infrastructure is most commonly corroded by sulfate arising from the oxidation of sulfide which occurs when bacteria (for example in sewer mains) reduce the ever-present hydrogen sulfide gas to a film of sulfide (S-) or bi-sulfide (HS-) ions. This reaction is reversible, both readily oxidising on exposure to air or oxygenated stormwater, to produce sulfite or sulfate ions and acidic hydrogen ions in the reaction HS− + H2O+ O2 -> 2H+ + SO4-. The corrosion often present in the crown (top) of concrete sewers is directly attributible to this process - known as crown rot corrosion.|$|E
30|$|Hydration of {{hydraulic}} components {{from both}} the hydraulic lime and <b>cement</b> <b>binders</b> results {{in the production of}} C-S-H. Hydration of cement clinker components, such as alite (C 3 S), occurs significantly more rapidly than hydraulic components associated with lime (i.e. β-belite) [36]. The hydration of alite is therefore responsible for early strength gain in Portland cement materials. Carbonation of calcium hydroxide in the mixed material, combined with the continuation of β-belite hydration, will account for the longer term strength development in hydraulic limes [36, 47].|$|R
