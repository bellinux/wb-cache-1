40|$|The M 2 tide in the Bohai, Yellow, and East China Seas (BYECS) is {{simulated}} by assimilating the TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry {{data with}} the adjoint method. The bottom friction coefficients (BFC) {{are supposed to}} be spatially varying. In this paper, the BFC at some grid points are chosen as the independent BFC and the BFC at the other grid points can be obtained through linear interpolation with these independent BFC. The independent BFC are selected uniformly over each 1 ¢X ¡_ 1 ¢X area and 120 independent BFC are obtained. Twin and practical experiments are carried out to discuss the spatially varying BFC. The results of twin experiments demonstrate that the adjoint method has a strong ability of inverting the prescribed BFC distributions combined with the spatially varying BFC. The prescribed BFC distributions are all successfully inverted. In practical experiments, the simulation precision has been highly increased by optimizing the spatially varying independent BFC. Three amphidromic points and a degenerate one appear in the <b>cotidal</b> <b>charts</b> of M 2 tide and the results coincide with the observed M 2 tide in BYECS fairly well...|$|R
40|$|A 2 D {{numerical}} {{model with a}} space grid of about 14 km is applied to calculate diurnal tidal constituents K(1) and O(1) in the Arctic Ocean. Calculated corange and <b>cotidal</b> <b>charts</b> show that along the continental slope, local regions of increased sea level amplitude, highly variable phase and enhanced currents occur. It is shown that in these local regions, shelf waves (topographic waves) of tidal origin are generated. In the Arctic Ocean and Northern Atlantic Ocean more than 30 regions of enhanced currents are identified. To prove the near-resonant interaction of the diurnal tides with the local bottom topography, the natural periods of oscillations for all regions have been calculated. The flux of energy averaged over the tidal period depicts the gyres of semitrapped energy, suggesting that the shelf waves are partially trapped over the irregularities of the bottom topography. It is shown that the occurrence of near-resonance phenomenon changes the energy flow in the tidal waves. First, the flux of energy from the astronomical sources is amplified in the shelf wave regions, and afterwards the tidal energy is strongly dissipated in the same regions...|$|R
40|$|Goddard Ocean Tide model GOT 99. 2 {{is a new}} {{solution}} for the amplitudes and phases of the global oceanic tides, based on over six years of sea-surface height measurements by the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite altimeter. Comparison with deep-ocean tide-gauge measurements show that this new tidal solution is an improvement over previous global models, with accuracies for the main semidiurnal lunar constituent M 2 now below 1. 5 cm (deep water only). The new solution benefits from use of prior hydrodynamic models, several in shallow and inland seas {{as well as the}} global finite-element model FES 94. 1. This report describes some of the data processing details involved in handling the altimetry, and it provides a comprehensive set of global <b>cotidal</b> <b>charts</b> of the resulting solutions. Various derived tidal charts are also provided, including tidal loading deformation charts, tidal gravimetric charts, and tidal current velocity (or transport) charts. Finally, low-degree spherical harmonic coefficients are computed by numerical quadrature and are tabulated for the major short-period tides; these are useful for a variety of geodetic and geophysical purposes, especially in combination with similar estimates from satellite laser ranging...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Tidal {{gravity and}} tilt data are {{available}} with a great density in western Europe, so that local and regional variability of Earth tides are well documented. 0 1 and M 2 are the most reliable waves and the relevant ocean loads are deduced from some <b>cotidal</b> <b>charts</b> and from Green's functions given by Farrell. The reliability of the charts is proved a posteriori by the con-vergence of 0 1 and M 2 with respect to body tides for tilt and gravity. It is shown that a spatial trend of the gravimetric factor exists but cannot be analysed because of scatter in the data. For tilt tides {{the importance of the}} load due to the Bay of Biscay is emphasized; by considering tilt and strain powers, it is shown in a global approach that the noise is in favour of a local tilt-strain coupling, and it is proved that in each station a quantitative estimate of this phenomenon can be obtained by a statistical analysis derived from a theoretical scheme (King et al.) in as much as the ocean load is known with sufficient accuracy; an appraisal of the diminishing tilt factor is then deduced simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Major semidiurnal (M 2, S 2, and N 2) and diurnal (K • and O•) {{barotropic}} tides {{over the}} Newfoundland Shelf are computed using a three-dimensional nonlinear primitive equation model, with the vertical eddy viscosity calculated from a level 2. 5 turbulence closure scheme. Computed elevation <b>cotidal</b> <b>charts</b> {{for the five}} constituents are generally consistent with previous knowledge for this region. Comparisons based on a statistical analysis {{of the differences between}} the computed elevations and currents and in situ observations indicate good agreement. While M 2 tidal currents (up to 20 - 30 cm/s) are dominant, there are locally intensified diurnal currents (up to 5 - 10 cm/s) in some outer shelf locations. The diurnal current intensification is attributed to first-mode continental shelf waves. An examination is carried out for the vertical structure of the computed M 2 current and for the temporal and spatial variability of model turbulent kinetic energy, mixing length scale, vertical eddy viscosity, and bottom friction velocity. The examination indicates that large vertical eddy viscosity magnitudes and bottom friction velocities are associated with strong currents in shallow regions, where strong vertical shears produce large turbulent kinetic energy. Solutions with both specified and evolving vertical stratification indicate that the stratification has a significant influence on the vertical profile of tidal mixing parameters and currents in shallow areas. Tidally induced turbulence is substantially reduced in the bottom boundary layer and completely suppressed above it. Tidal currents decrease in the log layer, increase significantly in the rest of the bottom boundary layer, and decrease in the upper and middle water column. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Western South Atlantic is {{characterized}} by oceanographic and meteorological features of great interest. The Brazil-Malvinas Confluence occurs within a well-known active cyclogenetic region east of Andes Mountains, with impacts in weather and climate conditions of southeastern South America. In this study, it is presented the oceanic module for the numerical representation of the combined effect of tidal influence, fresh water discharge of Plata River and meteorological influences over the Brazil-Malvinas confluence region, through {{the implementation of a}} customized version of Princeton Ocean Model (POM). The system considers: (i) a large scale domain with 1 / 2 degree resolution based on monthly Levitus climatology for 3 D temperature and salinity fields besides surface winds and heat fluxes from global atmospheric models; and (ii) a one-way nested area with 1 / 12 degree close to the coast, from northern Argentina to southeast Brazilian shelf. Satellite observations of SST and SSH can also be included in the coarse grid for medium range forecasts. During the implementation stages, the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence region - and its typical seasonal variability - was the most sensitive indication of correct specification of volume transport across the southern open boundaries, between South America and Antarctica and between Africa and Antarctica, which is the key for a realistic representation of known circulation features. Other major highlight of this stage is the importance of Weddell Sea on tidal propagation and amphidrome formation in South Atlantic, being decisive for correct representation of tidal amplitudes and phases at the south-southeastern Brazilian coast. The altimetric data of Topex/Poseidon satellite mission was used for evaluation of <b>cotidal</b> <b>charts</b> and SSH variability given by the model on the low-resolution domain. The features of major interest in the high resolution grid are: storm surge events; the coastal plume of fresh water of Plata River and its influence over the inner shelf of Uruguay and South Brazil; eddy activity at the confluence region as well as the Brazil Current meandering and the intense SST gradient regions.

40|$|The marine {{ecosystem}} {{on the shelf}} and open ocean adjacent to South Georgia is extraordinarily rich, {{with a history of}} commercial exploitation. Although much progress has been made, attempts at modelling (and hence better understanding) this system have consistently been hampered by the poor representation of key physical processes in global or regional ocean general circulation models. Here we present the development of a high-resolution 3 D hydrodynamic model of the South Georgia shelf and the adjacent open ocean, including a novel method for prescribing freshwater fluxes. The ability of the model to reproduce the observed oceanography of the region is quantified by comparisons with data from tide gauges at South Georgia, with satellite-derived sea surface temperatures, and with an extensive CTD dataset collected during January–April 1995. Predicted <b>cotidal</b> <b>charts</b> for the diurnal tides O 1 and K 1 show a periodic amplification in both the current and elevation fields at the shelf edge, suggesting the presence of a diurnally forced continental shelf wave. This could have important implications for processes such as larval transport and retention. The comparison with CTD data reveals mean and root mean square errors in temperature (salinity) of – 0. 27 °C (− 0. 07) and 0. 64 °C (0. 23), respectively. Vertical profiles of potential temperature and salinity on the shelf agree acceptably well with observations, but there is a tendency for the model to under-predict the density contrast between surface and bottom waters. The main limitation on model accuracy is found to be the large-scale forcing. Releasing a passive tracer into the model, transport and retention pathways are identified, including a prevalence for tracer export from the shelf to the west of South Georgia, and a transport pathway linking South Georgia and Shag Rocks. Significantly, the model suggests this to be a unidirectional link, from South Georgia to Shag Rocks, with possible significance for fisheries management. The implications of these results {{in the context of the}} South Georgia ecosystem are discussed briefly, demonstrating the usefulness of this new tool for interdisciplinary studies of the region. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} and amplification of {{the tide}} at the Gerlache and Bransfield Straits, northwestern {{side of the}} Antarctic Peninsula, was studied by analysis of thirteen series of direct sea level measurements. Harmonic analysis was performed to obtain the amplitudes and phases of the M_ 2, S_ 2, O_ 1 and K_ 1 tidal constituents. Based on the computed harmonic constants, <b>cotidal</b> and corange <b>charts</b> of these main constituents were prepared. The M_ 2 cotidal lines are parallel to the coast and show predominantly southeastward propagation, except at {{the western side of}} the Trinity Peninsula, where the M_ 2 wave pivots to enter the Bransfield Strait from the Weddell Sea and turns southwestward. M_ 2 amplitudes present a southwestward decrease. S_ 2 cotidal lines are normal to the Antarctic Peninsula coast and show southwestward propagation. S_ 2 corange lines increase eastward from the Gerlache Strait to the Antarctic Strait. O_ 1 and K_ 1 cotidal lines are also normal to the Antarctic Peninsula coast. Diurnal amplitudes are alike in the study area except at the northwestern side of the Antarctic Strait where they present a maximum gradient. Amplitudes of the main tidal constituents are higher in the northwestern Weddell Sea than at the northwestern side of the peninsula. This fact explains the maximum tidal amplitudes observed at the Antarctic Strait in comparison to the Bransfield Strait...|$|R
