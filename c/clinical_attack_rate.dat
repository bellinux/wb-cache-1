40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} mass vaccination with adjuvanted vaccines (eventually 40 % population coverage) and antivirals during the 2009 influenza pandemic in Norway, we fitted an age-structured SEIR model using data on vaccinations and sales of antivirals in 2009 / 10 in Norway to Norwegian ILI surveillance data from 5 October 2009 to 4 January 2010. We estimate a <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> of approximately 30 % (28. 7 - 29. 8 %), with highest disease rates among children 0 - 14 years (43 - 44 %). Vaccination started in week 43 and came too late {{to have a strong}} influence on the pandemic in Norway. Our results indicate that the countermeasures prevented approximately 11 - 12 % of potential cases relative to an unmitigated pandemic. Vaccination was found responsible for roughly 3 in 4 of the avoided infections. An estimated 50 % reduction in the <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> would have resulted from vaccination alone, had the campaign started 6 weeks earlier. Had vaccination been prioritized for children first, the intervention should have commenced approximately 5 weeks earlier in order to achieve the same 50 % reduction. In comparison, we estimate that a non-adjuvanted vaccination program should have started 8 weeks earlier to lower the <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> by 50 %. In conclusion, vaccination timing was a critical factor in relation to the spread of the 2009 A(H 1 N 1) influenza.

Herein, we examined the 1889 “Russian” pandemic. <b>Clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> were retrieved for 408 geographic entities in 14 European countries and in the United States. Case fatality ratios were estimated from datasets in the French, British and German armies, and morbidity and mortality records of Swiss cities. Weekly all-cause mortality was analyzed in 96 European and American cities. The pandemic spread rapidly, taking only 4 months to circumnavigate the planet, peaking in the United States 70 days after the original peak in St. Petersburg.

40|$|Local {{epidemic}} curves {{during the}} 1918 – 1919 influenza pandemic were often characterized by multiple epidemic waves. Identifying the underlying cause(s) of such waves may help manage future pandemics. We investigate {{the hypothesis that}} these waves were caused by people avoiding potentially infectious contacts—a behaviour termed ‘social distancing’. We estimate the effective disease reproduction number and from it infer the maximum degree of social distancing {{that occurred during the}} course of the multiple-wave epidemic in Sydney, Australia. We estimate that, on average across the city, people reduced their infectious contact rate by as much as 38 %, and that this was sufficient to explain the multiple waves of this epidemic. The basic reproduction number, R 0, was estimated to be in the range of 1. 6 – 2. 0 with a preferred estimate of 1. 8, in line with other recent estimates for the 1918 – 1919 influenza pandemic. The data are also consistent with a high proportion (more than 90 %) of the population being initially susceptible to clinical infection, and the proportion of infections that were asymptomatic (if this occurs) being no higher than approximately 9 %. The observed <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> of 36. 6 % was substantially lower than the 59 % expected based on the estimated value of R 0, implying that approximately 22 % of the population were spared from clinical infection.

40|$|Development of {{strategies}} for mitigating {{the severity of}} a new influenza pandemic is now a top global public health priority. Influenza prevention and containment strategies can be considered under the broad categories of antiviral, vaccine and non-pharmaceutical (case isolation, household quarantine, school or workplace closure, restrictions on travel) measures. Mathematical models are powerful tools for exploring this complex landscape of intervention strategies and quantifying the potential {{costs and benefits of}} different options. Here we use a large-scale epidemic simulation to examine intervention options should initial containment of a novel influenza outbreak fail, using Great Britain and the United States as examples. We find that border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions are unlikely to delay spread by more than 2 - 3 weeks unless more than 99 % effective. School closure during the peak of a pandemic can reduce peak <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> by up to 40 %, but has little impact on overall <b>attack</b> <b>rates,</b> whereas case isolation or household quarantine could have a significant impact, if feasible. Treatment of clinical cases can reduce transmission, but only if antivirals are given within a day of symptoms starting. Given enough drugs for 50 % of the population, household-based prophylaxis coupled with reactive school closure could reduce <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> by 40 - 50 %. More widespread prophylaxis would be even more logistically challenging but might reduce <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> by over 75 %.

40|$|Abstract Background The WHO {{suggested}} that governments stockpile, {{as part of}} preparations for the next influenza pandemic, sufficient influenza antiviral drugs to treat approximately 25 % of their populations. Our aim is two-fold: first, since in many countries the antiviral stockpile is well below this level, we search for suboptimal strategies based on treatment provided only to an age-dependent fraction of cases. Second, since in some countries the stockpile exceeds the suggested minimum level, we search for optimal strategies for post-exposure prophylactic treatment of close contacts of cases. Methods We used a stochastic, spatially structured individual-based model, considering explicit transmission in households, schools and workplaces, to simulate the spatiotemporal spread of an influenza pandemic in Italy and to evaluate the efficacy of interventions based on age-prioritized use of antivirals. Results Our {{results show that the}} antiviral stockpile required for treatment of cases ranges from 10 % to 35 % of the population for R 0 in 1. 4 – 3. No suboptimal strategies, based on treatment provided to an age-dependent fraction of cases, were found able to remarkably reduce both <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> and antiviral drugs needs, though they can contribute to largely reduce the excess mortality. Treatment of all cases coupled with prophylaxis provided to younger individuals is the only intervention resulting in a significant reduction of the <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> and requiring a relatively small stockpile of antivirals. Conclusion Our results strongly suggest that governments stockpile sufficient influenza antiviral drugs to treat approximately 25 % of their populations, under the assumption that R 0 is not much larger than 2. In countries where the number of antiviral stockpiled exceeds the suggested minimum level, providing prophylaxis to younger individuals is an option that could be taken into account in preparedness plans. In countries where the number of antivirals stockpiled is well below 25 % of the population, priority should be decided based on age-specific case fatality rates. However, late detection of cases (administration of antivirals 48 hours after the clinical onset of symptoms) dramatically affects the efficacy of both treatment and prophylaxis. </p...|$|E

After the 2009 influenza A(H 1 N 1) pandemic, seroprevalence studies found 5 to 60 % of populations across different continents and age groups having antibodies against the A(H 1 N 1) 2009 virus.

Subsequent reports of de-creased systolic function, heart failure, and leukemia prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to institute a “black box ” warning in 2005. This review was undertaken to examine the available literature on the efficacy and safety of mitoxantrone use in patients with MS since the initial report. Methods: Relevant articles were obtained through {{a review of the}} medical literature and the strength of the available evidence was graded according to the American Academy of Neurology evidence classification scheme. Results: The accumulated Class III and IV evidence suggests an increased incidence of systolic dysfunction and therapy-related acute leukemia (TRAL) with mitoxantrone therapy. Systolic dys-function occurs in 12 % of patients with MS treated with mitoxantrone, congestive heart failure occurs in 0. 4 %, and leukemia occurs in 0. 8 %.

Judging its pandemic potential is difficult with limited data, but nevertheless essential to inform appropriate health responses. By analyzing the outbreak in Mexico, early data on international spread, and viral genetic diversity, we make an early assessment of transmissibility and severity. Our estimates suggest that 23, 000 (range 6000 to 32, 000) individuals had been infected in Mexico by late April, giving an estimated case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0. 4 % (range: 0. 3 to 1. 8 %) based on confirmed and suspected deaths reported to that time. In a community outbreak {{in the small}} community of La Gloria, Veracruz, no deaths were attributed to infection, giving an upper 95 % bound on CFR of 0. 6 %. Thus, although substantial uncertainty remains, clinical severity appears less than that seen in the 1918 influenza pandemic but comparable with that seen in the 1957 pandemic. <b>Clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> in children in La Gloria were twice that in adults (< 15 years of age: 61 %; ≥ 15 years: 29 %).

40|$|Abstract—Mitoxantrone is {{the first}} drug {{approved}} {{for the treatment of}} secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) in the United States. This assessment considers use of mitoxantrone in the treatment of MS. Mitoxantrone probably reduces the <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> and reduces attack-related MRI outcomes in patients with relapsing MS (Type B recommendation). Also, mitoxantrone may have a beneficial effect on disease progression in patients with MS whose clinical condition is worsening (Type B recommendation). The potential for serious toxicity of mitoxantrone, however, {{must be taken into account}} when considering this therapy in individual patients. Moreover, because the potential clinical benefits on disease progression appear to be only modest, the results of the single phase III trial should be replicated in another (and hopefully much larger) clinical study before this agent is widely recommended for the treatment of patients with MS.

40|$|It is {{impossible}} to predict when the next pandemic of influenza will occur; however, it is almost 35 years since the last pandemic, and the longest inter-pandemic interval recorded with certainty is 39 years. The next pandemic virus is likely to emerge in southeast Asia, as have two {{of the last three}} pandemic viruses. Complete global spread is likely to occur in 6 months or less, due to increased travel and urbanisation. It is likely that the usual inter-pandemic pattern of age-specific mortality will deviate temporarily towards higher mortality in younger adults. The extent to which this will happen is unclear, as the shift was extreme in 1918 – 1919 but less so in subsequent pandemics. Nevertheless, this may have important implications for the protection of essential workers such as health care, emergency service and military personnel. The extent to which elderly persons will be affected will depend upon previous exposure to similar influenza viruses. It {{is impossible}} to predict the likely increase in excess mortality that will occur when a new pandemic virus emerges. However, whilst mortality on the scale experienced in 1918 – 1919 is probably unlikely, there was a high level of mortality among those infected with the A/H 5 N 1 virus in 1997, so it cannot be assumed that a future pandemic will be as mild as those in 1957 – 1958 or 1968 – 1969.

In the present study, we evaluated the diffusion of pandemic influenza in Italy {{and the impact of}} various control measures, coupling a global SEIR model for importation of cases with an individual based model (IBM) describing the Italian epidemic. Methodology/Principal Findings: We co-located the Italian population (57 million inhabitants) to households, schools and workplaces and we assigned travel destinations to match the 2001 census data. We considered different R 0 values (1. 4; 1. 7; 2), evaluating the impact of control measures (vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis -AVP-, international air travel restrictions and increased social distancing). The administration of two vaccine doses was considered, assuming that first dose would be administered 1 - 6 months after the first world case, and different values for vaccine effectiveness (VE). With no interventions, importation would occur 37 – 77 days after the first world case. Air travel restrictions would delay the importation of the pandemic by 7 – 37 days. With an R 0 of 1. 4 or 1. 7, the use of combined measures would reduce <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> (AR) from 21 – 31 % to 0. 3 – 4 %. Assuming an R 0 of 2, the AR would decrease from 38 % to 8 %, yet only if vaccination were started within 2 months of the first world case, in combination with a 90 % reduction in international air traffic, closure of schools/ workplaces for 4 weeks and AVP of household and school/work close contacts of clinical cases.

Real-time forecasts of epidemic spread using data-driven models have been hindered by the technical challenges posed by parameter estimation and validation. Data gathered for the 2009 H 1 N 1 influenza crisis represent an unprecedented opportunity to validate real-time model predictions and define the main success criteria for different approaches. Methods: We used the Global Epidemic and Mobility Model to generate stochastic simulations of epidemic spread worldwide, yielding (among other measures) the incidence and seeding events at a daily resolution for 3, 362 subpopulations in 220 countries. Using a Monte Carlo Maximum Likelihood analysis, the model provided {{an estimate of the}} seasonal transmission potential during the early phase of the H 1 N 1 pandemic and generated ensemble forecasts for the activity peaks in the northern hemisphere in the fall/winter wave. These results were validated against the real-life surveillance data collected in 48 countries, and their robustness assessed by focusing on 1) the peak timing of the pandemic; 2) the level of spatial resolution allowed by the model; and 3) the <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> and the effectiveness of the vaccine. In addition, we studied the effect of data incompleteness on the prediction reliability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Hepatitis E is an {{important}} medical pathogen {{in many developing countries}} but is rarely reported from the United States, although antibody to hepatitis E virus (anti-HEV) is found in. 1 % of U. S. citizens. Zoonotic spread of the virus is suspected. Sera obtained from 239 wild rats trapped in widely separated regions of the United States were tested for anti-HEV. Seventy-seven percent of rats from Maryland, 90 % from Hawaii, and 44 % from Louisiana were seropositive for anti-HEV. Rats from urban as well as rural areas were seropositive and the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG increased in parallel with the estimated age of the rats, leading to speculation that they might be involved in the puzzling high prevalence of anti-HEV among some U. S. city dwellers. The discovery of anti-HEV in rats in the United States and the recently reported discovery that HEV is endemic in U. S. swine raise many questions about transmission, reservoirs, and strains of HEV in developed countries. Hepatitis E is the first or second most important cause of acute clinical hepatitis in many developing countries of Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. Hepatitis E can occur sporadically or in epidemics and the peak <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> usually occurs in young adults. 1 Hepatitis E is caused b...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) {{caused a}} major two-wave seventeen-month-long {{outbreak}} in La Réunion Island in 2005 – 2006. The {{aim of this}} study was to refine clinical estimates provided by a regional surveillance-system using a two-stage serological assessment as gold standard. Methods Two serosurveys were implemented: first, a rapid survey using stored sera of pregnant women, in order to assess the <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> at the epidemic upsurge (s 1, February 2006; n = 888); second, a population-based survey among a random sample of the community, to assess the herd immunity in the post-epidemic era (s 2, October 2006; n = 2442). Sera were screened for anti-CHIKV specific antibodies (IgM and IgG in s 1, IgG only in s 2) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Seroprevalence rates were compared to <b>clinical</b> estimates of <b>attack</b> <b>rates.</b> Results In s 1, 18. 2 % of the pregnant women were tested positive for CHIKV specific antibodies (13. 8 % for both IgM and IgG, 4. 3 % for IgM, 0. 1 % for IgG only) which provided a congruent estimate with the 16. 5 % <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> calculated from the surveillance-system. In s 2, the seroprevalence in community was estimated to 38. 2 % (95 % CI, 35. 9 to 40. 6 %). Extrapolations of seroprevalence rates led to estimate, at 143, 000 and at 300, 000 (95 % CI, 283, 000 to 320, 000), the number of people infected in s 1 and in s 2, respectively. In comparison, the surveillance-system estimated at 130, 000 and 266, 000 the number of people infected for the same periods. Conclusion A rapid serosurvey in pregnant women can be helpful to assess the <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> when large seroprevalence studies cannot be done. On the other hand, a population-based serosurvey is useful to refine the estimate when clinical diagnosis underestimates it. Our findings give valuable insights to assess the herd immunity along the course of epidemics. </p...|$|R
40|$|This survey {{through the}} Association of Clinical Pathologists was {{continued}} and extended for 1980 - 81, {{with the help}} of the Institute of Medical Laboratory Sciences. Hepatitis maintained a low <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> of 26 / 100 000 person-years, including only three cases of hepatitis B probably attributable to laboratory work (<b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> 9). Nineteen cases of tuberculosis (<b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> 56) included 14 of probable occupational origin (<b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> 41) half of which involved post-mortem or mortuary work. Thirteen bacterial infections of the bowel (<b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> 38, predominantly shigellosis) involved almost exclusively microbiology MLSOs, with 10 attributed to laboratory work (<b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> 29). The seven other infections included 4 of occupational sepsis in morbid anatomy and post-mortem workers. There appears to be scope for improvement in bacteriological bench techniques particularly at the faeces bench and for reduction in the hazards of tuberculosis and sepsis for morbid anatomy and mortuary workers...|$|R
40|$|Parvovirus B 19 is {{associated}} with erythema infectiosum in children or arthralgia and arthritis in adults. The virus is relatively conserved and nucleotide identity is expected in viruses that are epidemiologically related. Here, we describe the first cluster of parvovirus infection among hospital staff documented in Taiwan. Methods: Active surveillance was conducted in coronary care units (CCUs) at a 2200 -bed teaching hospital for 1 month in 2007. A case defined clinically as occurring in a patient or staff in CCUs with new onset of fever or rash. Serum was tested for parvovirus B 19 IgM and IgG by immunoblotting and DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction. When viremia was detected, nucleotide sequences were analyzed and {{compared with those of}} two <b>clinical</b> isolates. The <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> was defined as the cumulative incidence of acute infection in CCU staff and patients during the study period. Results: Among 57 staff and 15 patients, five nurses met the clinical case definition. Three had acute infection as demonstrated by viral DNA and IgM. The <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> was 5. 3 % for the staff and zero for patients. Seroprevalence rate was lower in staff than in patients (26. 3 % vs. 53. 3 %). The isolates collected from three cases were highly similar to a community isolate, and they varied with each other by 2 - 6 nucleotides. The isolate collected from a nurse was identical to that from her friend 3 weeks apart and was concordant with mutual transmission. A sequence with 45 nucleotide variations was identified from a staff member with chronic infection who was negative for IgM and had only weak IgG anti-VP 1 reaction with immunoblotting. We did not find any patient as the source of infection. Conclusion: We identified a cluster of parvovirus infection that was caused by three circulating strains which did not support the hypothesis of transmission of a single strain in CCUs...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{introduction}} of A 2 /Hong Kong/ 68 influenza virus into 2 different susceptible populations residing in Thailand and the Panama Canal Zone, epidemic disease occurred within approximately 1 month. The establishment and transmission of the virus, and the disease it caused, were studied in detail. The rates of progression and extent of overt epidemic disease and the proportions of overt to subclinical infection in the 2 areas were different. In Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, only 8 % of US servicemen became ill, although 13 % of them were infected. The epidemic progressed slowly, so that no more than 1. 5 % of the population were ill {{at any one time}} during the 3 months of its recognized presence. In contrast, in the Canal Zone the <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> approached 50 %, and subclinical infection occurred in 5 % or less of the population during a 6 -week period when absenteeism from schools and work was quite obvious. Factors such as immunization status of the populations and virulence of virus seemed not to be primarily responsible for the differences. Rather, the latter appear to be related to differences in environmental circumstances, with crowding contributing to the higher disease incidence in the Canal Zone...|$|E
40|$|Background. Little {{is known}} about the {{clinical}} presentation and epidemiology of influenza A H 1 N 1 pdm in children in developing countries. We assessed the severity of influenza A H 1 N 1 pdm in children in Nicaragua by comparing H 1 N 1 pdm cases to seasonal influenza cases in an ongoing cohort study. Methods. The Nicaraguan Influenza Cohort Study was established in June 2007 to study the burden and seasonality of pediatric influenza in a tropical developing country. During the period from June 2007 through November 2009, a total of 4391 children aged 2 – 14 years participated in the cohort. We examined the attack rate of clinical influenza and assessed symptoms at first presentation in febrile patients with H 1 N 1 pdm versus those with seasonal influenza A or B. Results. The estimated <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate</b> of H 1 N 1 pdm in the cohort was 20. 1 %, compared to 11. 7 % and 15. 1 % for seasonal influenza A and 11. 9 % and 24. 2 % for seasonal influenza A and B in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Symptoms significantly associated with H 1 N 1 pdm cases versus seasonal influenza A cases were sore throat (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1. 7; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 2 – 2. 5), wheezing (OR, 5. 1; 95 % CI, 1. 3 – 19. 0), rhonchi (OR...|$|E
40|$|Background: Wide-scale use of {{antiviral}} {{agents in}} the event of an influenza pandemic is likely to promote the emergence of drug resistance, with potentially deleterious effects for outbreak control. We explored factors promoting resistance within a dynamic infection model, and considered ways in which one or two drugs might be distributed to delay the spread of resistant strains or mitigate their impact. Methods and Findings: We have previously developed a novel deterministic model of influenza transmission that simulates treatment and targeted contact prophylaxis, using a limited stockpile of antiviral agents. This model was extended to incorporate subclinical infections, and the emergence of resistant virus strains under the selective pressure imposed by various uses of one or two antiviral agents. For a fixed <b>clinical</b> <b>attack</b> <b>rate,</b> R 0 rises with the proportion of subclinical infections thus reducing the number of infections amenable to treatment or prophylaxis. In consequence, outbreak control is more difficult, but emergence of drug resistance is relatively uncommon. Where an epidemic may be constrained by use of a single antiviral agent, strategies that combine treatment and prophylaxis are most effective at controlling transmission, at the cost of facilitating the spread of resistant viruses. If two drugs are available, using one drug for treatment and the other for prophylaxis is more effective at preventing propagation of mutant strains than either random allocation or drug cycling strategies. Our model is relatively straightforward, and of necessity makes a number of simplifying assumptions. Ou...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} whether changes in <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> of fecal-orally transmitted diseases among travelers {{are related to}} changes in pretravel vaccination practices or better hygienic standards at travel destination. Methods. National surveillance data on all laboratory-confirmed cases of travel-related hepatitis A, shigellosis, and typhoid fever diagnosed in the Netherlands from 1995 to 2006 were matched {{with the number of}} Dutch travelers to developing countries to calculate region-specific annual <b>attack</b> <b>rates.</b> Trends in <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> of non-vaccine-preventable shigellosis were compared with those of vaccine-preventable hepatitis A and typhoid fever. Trends were also compared with three markers for hygienic standards of the local population at travel destinations, drawn from the United Nations Development Programme database: the human development index, the sanitation index, and the water source index. Results. <b>Attack</b> <b>rates</b> among Dutch travelers to developing regions declined for hepatitis A, shigellosis, and typhoid fever. Region-specific trends in <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> of shigellosis resembled trends of hepatitis A and typhoid fever. Declining <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> of the three fecal-orally transmitted diseases correlated with improvements in socioeconomic, sanitary, and water supply conditions of the local population at travel destination. Conclusions. These findings suggest that improved hygienic standards at travel destination strongly contributed to the overall decline in <b>attack</b> <b>rates</b> of fecal-orally transmitted diseases among visiting traveler...|$|R
