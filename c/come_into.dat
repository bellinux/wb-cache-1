40|$|Consider a {{specific}} type of fission where psychological continuity takes a branching form, and one of the offshoots <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being later than the other offshoot. Let us say that the earlier offshoot <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being in the left branch at t, and the later offshoot <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being in the right branch at t+ 1. With regard to the question how many persons are involved in this case, three answers are worth considering: (i) The original subject persists up to t; a distinct person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being immediately after t and continues to exist in the left branch; and the third person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being in the right branch at t+ 1. (ii) The original subject persists up to the moment immediately before t+ 1; a distinct person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being at t+ 1 and continues to exist in the left branch; and the third person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being in the right branch at t+ 1. (iii) The original subject continues to exist in the left branch; a distinct person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being in the right branch at t+ 1. For those who hold that personal identity consists in psychological continuity of some sort, the aforementioned three options exhaust the sensible ways of understanding how one persists in delayed fission. However, I argue that complications arise for each answer. Hence, delayed fission poses a challenge for the psychological approach to personal identity. close...|$|R

The fact that on some deserted island or planet, people not <b>came</b> <b>into</b> existence and not suffer is good. This is because the absence of pain is good even when there is someone who is experiencing this good. On the other hand, we do not feel sadness {{by the fact that}} on some deserted island or planet people not <b>came</b> <b>into</b> existence and are not happy. This is because the absence of pleasure is bad only when there is someone who is deprived of this good.|$|R
