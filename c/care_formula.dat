40|$|ABSTRACT. One hundred {{patients}} supported with enteral {{tube feeding}} were evaluated for biochemical abnormalities. The following metabolic complications were observed: hypergly-cemia (29 %), hypoglycermia (2 %) hypernatremia (10 %), hypo-natremia (31 %), hyperkalemia (40 %) hypokalemia (8 %), hyper-phosphatemia (14 %) hypophosphatemia (30 %) hypomagne-semia (3 %), hypozincemia (11 %), and hypocupremia (3 %). Be-cause {{of the extensive}} range of biochemical problems, {{it is recommended that}} subjects on tube feeding be evaluated pe-riodically for metabolic abnormalities. Enteral tube feeding is used extensively to provide nutritional support for patients who are unable to con-sume sufficient calories and protein, but who have a functional gastrointestinal tract. 1, 2 However, the fre-quency and severity of metabolic complications accom-panying the use of enteral tube feeding have not been clearly documented. In this study, 100 patients supported with enteral tube feeding were evaluated for metabolic abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients at the Scott and White Clinic and Memo-rial Hospital who are supported on enteral tube feeding are placed on a standard tube feeding protocol. ’ This protocol provides guidelines for uniform methods of tube insertion, nursing <b>care,</b> <b>formula</b> composition, infusion rates, measurement of residual gastric volume, and se-quential laboratory studies (Figs. 1 - 3).

40|$|Abstract Emergency {{management}} organisations recognise {{the vulnerability}} of infants in emergencies, even in developed countries. However, thus far, those who care for infants have not been provided with detailed information on what emergency preparedness entails. Emergency management authorities should provide those who care for infants with accurate and detailed information on the supplies necessary {{to care for them}} in an emergency, distinguishing between the needs of breastfed infants and the needs of formula fed infants. Those who <b>care</b> for <b>formula</b> fed infants should be provided with detailed information on the supplies necessary for an emergency preparedness kit and with information on how to prepare formula feeds in an emergency. An emergency preparedness kit for exclusively breastfed infants should include 100 nappies and 200 nappy wipes. The contents of an emergency preparedness for formula fed infants will vary depending upon whether ready-to-use liquid infant formula or powdered infant formula is used. If ready-to-use liquid infant formula is used, an emergency kit should include: 56 serves of ready-to-use liquid infant formula, 84 L water, storage container, metal knife, small bowl, 56 feeding bottles and teats/cups, 56 zip-lock plastic bags, 220 paper towels, detergent, 120 antiseptic wipes, 100 nappies and 200 nappy wipes. If powdered infant formula is used, an emergency preparedness kit should include: two 900 g tins powdered infant formula, 170 L drinking water, storage container, large cooking pot with lid, kettle, gas stove, box of matches/lighter, 14 kg liquid petroleum gas, measuring container, metal knife, metal tongs, feeding cup, 300 large sheets paper towel, detergent, 100 nappies and 200 nappy wipes. Great care with regards hygiene should be taken in the preparation of formula feeds. Child protection organisations should ensure that foster carers responsible for infants have the resources necessary to formula feed {{in the event of an}} emergency. Exclusive and continued breastfeeding should be promoted as an emergency preparedness activity by emergency management organisations as well as health authorities. The greater the proportion of infants exclusively breastfed when an emergency occurs, the more resilient the community, and the easier it will be to provide effective aid to the caregivers of formula fed infants. </p...|$|R

40|$|ContextThe {{health and}} {{economic}} burden of hypertension, a {{major risk factor}} for cardiovascular disease, is substantial. This systematic review evaluated the economic evidence of self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) monitoring interventions to control hypertension. Evidence acquisitionThe literature search from database inception to March 2015 identified 22 studies for inclusion with three types of interventions: SMBP used alone, SMBP with additional support, and SMBP within team-based <b>care</b> (TBC). Two <b>formulae</b> were used to convert reductions in systolic BP (SBP) to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to produce cost per QALY saved. All analyses were conducted in 2015, with estimates adjusted to 2014 U. S dollars. Evidence synthesisMedian costs of intervention were 60 and 174 per person for SMBP alone and SMBP with additional support, respectively, and 732 per person per year for SMBP within TBC. SMBP alone and SMBP with additional support reduced healthcare cost per person per year from outpatient visits and medication (medians 148 and 3, respectively; median follow-up, 122 ̆ 01313 months). SMBP within TBC exhibited an increase in healthcare cost (median, 447 per person per year; median follow-up, 18 months). SMBP alone varied from cost saving to a maximum cost of 144, 000 per QALY saved, with two studies reporting an increase in SBP. The two translated median costs per QALY saved were 2, 800 and 4, 000 for SMBP with additional support and 7, 500 and 10, 800 for SMBP within TBC. ConclusionsSMBP monitoring interventions with additional support or within TBC are cost effective. Cost effectiveness of SMBP used alone could not be determined.

In this paper, ‘large’ aircraft are aircraft having a maximum take of mass (MTOM) of more than 40 t respectively having 70 or more passenger seats in a typical layout. The mass of the aircraft is split into the 10 main components of the aircraft (e. g. wing, fuselage…) and one formula is developed for each component (part B to K). The sum of the component masses results in the MME respectively OME of the aircraft (part L and M). The component masses, as well as the MME and OME are defined according to the Airbus Mass Standard Reference Guide (Issue 3). A brief description of the definition of each mass, as well as the main differences to the DIN 9020, which is normally used within LTH, is given for each component.

40|$|Background: There {{have been}} few {{systematic}} reviews and no meta-analyses of the clinical benefits of nutritional support in patients with, or at risk of developing, pressure ulcers. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to address the impact of enteral nutritional support on pressure ulcer incidence and healing {{and a range of}} other clinically relevant outcome measures in this group. Methods: Fifteen studies (including eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) or enteral tube feeding (ETF), identified using electronic databases (including Pub Med and Cochrane) and bibliography searches, were included in the systematic review. Outcomes including pressure ulcer incidence, pressure ulcer healing, quality of life, complications, mortality, anthropometry and dietary intake were recorded, with the aim of comparing nutritional support versus routine care (e. g. usual diet and pressure ulcer <b>care)</b> and nutritional <b>formulas</b> of different composition. Of these 15 studies, 5 RCTs comparing ONS (4 RCTs) and ETF (1 RCT) with routine care could be included in a meta-analysis of pressure ulcer incidence. Results: Meta-analysis showed that ONS (250 – 500 kcal, 2 – 26 weeks) were associated with a significantly lower incidence of pressure ulcer development in at-risk patients compared to routine care (odds ratio 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 62 – 0. 89, 4 RCTs, n = 1224, elderly, post-surgical, chronically hospitalised patients). Similar results were obtained when a combined meta-analysis of ONS (4 RCT) and ETF (1 RCT) trials was performed (OR 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 62 – 0. 88, 5 RCTs, n = 1325). Individual studies showed a trend towards improved healing of existing pressure ulcers with disease-specific (including high protein) versus standard formulas, although robust RCTs are required to confirm this. Although some studies indicate that total nutritional intake is improved, data on other outcome measures (quality of life) are lacking. Conclusions: This systematic review shows enteral nutritional support, particularly high protein ONS, can significantly reduce the risk of developing pressure ulcers (by 25 %). Although studies suggest ONS and ETF may improve healing of PU, further research to confirm this trend is required...|$|R
