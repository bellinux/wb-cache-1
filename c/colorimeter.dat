25|$|Although Jaffe's name {{is synonymous}} with {{clinical}} creatinine testing, his paper only described the principle behind what would later become the enduring method. It was Otto Folin (1867–1934), a Harvard biochemist, who adapted Jaffe's research—abandoning the standard Neubauer reaction of the time—and published several papers using the Jaffe reaction to analyze creatinine levels in both blood and urine. Folin began using the picric acid procedure in 1901 and included it in his 1916 Lab Manual of Biological Chemistry. During his career, Folin modified and improved several quantitative colorimetric procedures, {{the first of which}} was for creatinine. He took advantage of technology available at the time, using a Duboscq <b>colorimeter</b> for measurement precision, and is credited for introducing colorimetry into modern biochemical analysis.|$|E
50|$|The {{color or}} {{wavelength}} of the filter {{chosen for the}} <b>colorimeter</b> is extremely important, as the wavelength of light that is transmitted by the <b>colorimeter</b> {{has to be the}} same as that absorbed by the substance being measured.

50|$|A <b>colorimeter</b> is {{a device}} {{used to test}} the {{concentration}} of a solution by measuring its absorbance of a specific wavelength of light. To use this device, different solutions must be made, and a control (usually a mixture of distilled water and another solution) is first filled into a cuvette and placed inside a <b>colorimeter</b> to calibrate the machine. Only after the device has been calibrated can you use it to find the densities and/or concentrations of the other solutions. You do this by repeating the calibration, except with cuvettes filled with the other solutions.The filter on a <b>colorimeter</b> must be set to red if the liquid is blue. The size of the filter initially chosen for the <b>colorimeter</b> is extremely important, as the wavelength of light that is transmitted by the <b>colorimeter</b> has to be same as that absorbed by the substance.|$|E
50|$|A Tristimulus <b>colorimeter,</b> colloquially {{shortened}} to <b>colorimeter,</b> is used {{in digital}} imaging, to profile and calibrate output devices.It takes {{a limited number of}} wideband spectral energy readings along the visible spectrum by using filtered photodetectors; e.g. silicon photodiodes.|$|E
50|$|The {{concentration}} of a colorless solution cannot normally be determined with a <b>colorimeter.</b> The {{addition of a}} color reagent leads to a color reaction and the absorbance of the colored product can then be measured with a <b>colorimeter.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Optical {{measurement}} equipment includes photometers {{for measuring the}} density of tinting, <b>colorimeters</b> for measuring perceived color, and spectrometers for obtaining specific information about the spectral transmission of lenses.|$|R
5000|$|To use the <b>colorimeter,</b> {{different}} solutions must be made, {{including a}} control or reference of known concentration. With a visual <b>colorimeter,</b> {{for example the}} Duboscq <b>colorimeter</b> illustrated, {{the length of the}} light path through the solutions can be varied while filtered light transmitted through them is compared for a visual match. The concentration times path length is taken to be equal when the colors match, so the concentration of the unknown can be determined by simple proportions. [...] Nessler tubes work on the same principle.|$|E
50|$|Since {{different}} molecules {{pass through}} the resin tube at various speeds, graphing {{the output of the}} <b>colorimeter</b> against time indicates which amino acid is present. The amount of light passing through the <b>colorimeter</b> determines the percentage of change from the base line, the latter being set during calibration.|$|E

50|$|The {{readings}} {{by themselves}} are typically not as useful as their tristimulus values, {{which can be}} converted into chromaticity co-ordinates and manipulated through color space transformations. For this purpose, a spectrocolorimeter may be used. A spectrocolorimeter is simply a spectrophotometer that can estimate tristimulus values by numerical integration (of the color matching functions' inner product with the illuminant's spectral power distribution). One benefit of spectrocolorimeters over tristimulus <b>colorimeters</b> {{is that they do}} not have optical filters, which are subject to manufacturing variance, and have a fixed spectral transmittance curve—until they age. On the other hand, tristimulus <b>colorimeters</b> are purpose-built, cheaper, and easier to use.|$|R
