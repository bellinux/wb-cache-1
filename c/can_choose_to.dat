We construct ˜ L by iterating a {{construction of the}} first author and F. Wehrung and taking direct limits. We also discuss {{the case of a}} finite lattice L, in which case ˜ L <b>can</b> be <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> be finite, and of a lattice L with zero, in which case ˜ L <b>can</b> be <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> have zero and the extension <b>can</b> be <b>chosen</b> <b>to</b> preserve zero...|$|R

5|$|As {{the fare}} {{system has been}} {{integrated}} by TransitLink, commuters need to pay only one fare and pass through two fare gates (once on entry, once on exit) for an entire journey for most interchange stations, even when transferring between lines operated by different companies. Commuters <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> extend a trip mid-journey, and pay the difference when they exit their destination station.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{parallel}} line, the Hoved Line running {{all the way from}} Oslo S to Eidsvoll, some trains <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> use this line instead. This is primarily done by some commuter trains, as well as all freight trains. The only exception to this are trains hauling jet fuel to the airport, who have to use the Gardermoen Line from Kløfta. This service is provided by CargoNet.|$|E
5|$|Individuals <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> resign, {{sometimes}} to avoid expulsion: three members voluntarily left the Privy Council in the 20th century: Jonathan Aitken, on 25 June 1997 following allegations of perjury; John Profumo, who resigned on 26 June 1963; and John Stonehouse, who resigned on 17 August 1976.

5|$|Women {{are neither}} victims of {{deceitful}} men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> 'bestow' their favours {{on a man}} who will 'enjoy' them. In the earliest examples of the redefinition that develops throughout Fielding's works, virtue is no longer simply virginity, but something malleable and powerful {{in the hands of}} a woman granted the agency and intelligence to determine her own sexuality.|$|E
5|$|After Reggie catches Delsin vandalizing a billboard, their {{subsequent}} argument is interrupted when a military truck carrying three Conduit prisoners crashes on the Akomish reservation. Two of the Conduits escape, but Delsin manages {{to pull the}} third one, Hank, out of the wreckage, and inadvertently absorb his smoke powers. Shocked and frightened, Delsin pursues Hank {{in an effort to}} figure out what has happened and how to control his powers. However, they are both cornered by Brooke Augustine. She encases Hank in concrete and questions Delsin, suspecting him of hiding something. Delsin <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> either tell Augustine the truth about his powers or reveal nothing. Regardless, Augustine renders him unconscious before moving on to the other tribe members.|$|E

5|$|Because {{it was not}} {{possible}} to upgrade Gardner Hall, a new modern block, Orchard Hall, was built to replace it. Gardner became an assessment centre for prospective students. In September 2009 Gardner was made available as a venue for hire for functions such as weddings. In addition to the halls of residence, the college also owns several houses both on and off campus which enable students to gain a greater level of independent living. There is a restaurant which provides meals, or students <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> be self-catering. All accommodation has kitchen facilities.|$|E
5|$|During trials, {{the player}} cross-examines witnesses. They can move {{backwards}} and forwards through {{statements in the}} testimony, and <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> press the witness {{for more information on}} a particular statement; sometimes, the witness will revise their testimony based on this. If the player spots a lie or a contradiction in the testimony, they can present evidence to demonstrate the contradiction. If the player presents incorrect evidence, the judge's confidence in the player will be lowered; if the judge's confidence in the player is depleted, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 2016, Alton Towers {{announced}} that Air would be re-themed as Galactica for the 2016 season and would include on-ride virtual reality headsets simulating a {{ride through the}} cosmos. The announcement was made at an event held at the Science Museum. Each seat on the roller coaster is fitted with a Samsung Gear VR headset and pouch. The virtual reality experience is optional, as guests <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> ride without using the headsets. A promotional website was also released explaining {{more information about the}} ride and its new storyline.

5|$|The Public Faroese Health School (Faroese: Heilsuskúli Føroya) in Suðuroy is a {{vocational}} school offering {{two types of}} education. The health care assistant education (Heilsuhjálpari) takes fifteen months. Following graduation, pupils <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> leave the school and work in home care and retirement homes. Alternatively they can continue with another 22 months and become an assistant nurse (heilsurøktari). The assistant nurse can work in various places, mostly in retirement homes or hospitals.

As missions are completed, Shadow learns more about his past and regains memories. He <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> help Doctor Eggman or the Black Arms, to help G.U.N. and the series' heroic characters, or to help neither and keep the Chaos Emeralds for himself. The missions completed determine which one of ten possible endings will be seen after Shadow collects all the Chaos Emeralds and defeats one of the game's final bosses. The possible ending events range from planning to defeat the Black Arms to planning to destroy the planet.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes the}} role of the rōnin Shiren, who travels through thirty areas {{on his way to the}} Land of the Golden Condor. The game is turn-based, with all enemies and {{characters}} in an area moving whenever the player performs an action, such as attacking or moving. If the player falls in battle, they lose all their progress and are forced to restart from the beginning of the game: to counter-act this, they <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> store powerful items in warehouses, and pick them up again on further playthroughs; the Nintendo DS release also adds rescue quests, where a player can save other players who have fallen, allowing them to continue from where they left off.|$|E

5|$|The series follows demon-human hybrids called devil children, who {{journey from}} Japan to the demon world, and {{are joined by}} talking {{companion}} monsters who give them guidance. The player takes the role of one such devil child, and battles against demons; the devil children do not fight directly themselves, however, but have allied demons in their party fight for them. The player <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> talk to demons instead of fighting them, {{to try to make}} them join the player's party, and can increase their allied demons' power by fusing multiple demons with each other.|$|E

By June 2016, the ability to add skins was also added to the iOS and Android versions.|$|E
5|$|Ajay {{ends up in}} Yuma's {{mountain}} prison, {{from which}} he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother. The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other {{to prevent them from}} starting another civil war, and Ajay <b>can</b> <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.|$|E
