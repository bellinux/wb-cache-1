5|$|Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is {{adept at}} working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid <b>contact</b> <b>against</b> both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, {{and he may}} never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense at third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, {{and is likely to}} end up at first base down the road.|$|E

50|$|Although Thomason has {{suggested}} on theoretical grounds that Pidgin Delaware predated {{the arrival of}} Europeans and was used for communication with speakers of Iroquoian languages, there is no attestation of its existence prior to European <b>contact.</b> <b>Against</b> this suggestion are references {{to the difficulty of}} communication between Delawares and Iroquoian speakers.

40|$|Cognitive distortions {{are held}} to {{contribute}} to sexual offending against children {{in a number of}} theoretical explanations of such crimes. However, not only is there little or no direct evidence in support of the centrality of cognitive distortions in offending but recent research has questioned whether the concept has explanatory power. Cognitive distortions are variously seen as necessary for the offender to offend against children, as post-offending justifications for the offence, or as reflecting distorted patterns in the offender’s upbringing. This paper explores the role of cognitive distortions in sex offending by comparing the distortions of <b>contact</b> sex offenders <b>against</b> children with Internet child pornography offenders without <b>contact</b> offences <b>against</b> children. A new cognitive distortions questionnaire was developed which was suitable for administration to Internet offenders who had no <b>contact</b> offences <b>against</b> children as well as being suitable for contact offenders. It was found that some cognitive distortions are frequently agreed with by sex offenders against children whereas others were seldom or never agreed with. Little support was found for earlier typological approaches to the cognitive schema of sex offenders against children. Contrary to the expectation that contact offenders would have more cognitive distortions, it was found that Internet offenders had more cognitiv...|$|R
