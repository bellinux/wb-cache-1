5|$|Frogs {{are valued}} as food by humans and also have many {{cultural}} roles in literature, symbolism and religion. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than {{one third of}} species {{are considered to be}} threatened with extinction and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, <b>chytridiomycosis,</b> has spread around the world. Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.|$|E
5|$|A global {{strategy}} {{to stem the}} crisis was released in 2005 {{in the form of}} the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan. Developed by over eighty leading experts in the field, this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost. The Amphibian Specialist Group of the IUCN is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation. Amphibian Ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex-situ conservation recommendations of this plan, and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world, encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians. One such project is the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project that built on existing conservation efforts in Panama to create a country-wide response to the threat of <b>chytridiomycosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the ozone layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like <b>chytridiomycosis.</b> However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{diseases}} have {{been related to}} mass die-offs or declines in populations of amphibians, including [...] "red-leg" [...] disease (Aeromonas hydrophila), Ranavirus (family Iridoviridae), Anuraperkinsus, and <b>chytridiomycosis.</b> It is not entirely clear why these diseases have suddenly begun to affect amphibian populations, but some evidence suggests that these diseases may have been spread by humans, or may be more virulent when combined with other environmental factors.|$|E
500|$|Anthropogenic {{climate change}} has likely exerted a major effect on {{amphibian}} declines. [...] For example, in the Monteverde Cloud Forest, {{a series of}} unusually warm years led to the mass disappearances of the Monteverde Harlequin frog and the Golden Toad. [...] An increased level of cloud cover, a result of geoengineering and global warming, which has warmed the nights and cooled daytime temperatures, has been blamed for facilitating the growth and proliferation of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (the causative agent of the fungal infection <b>chytridiomycosis).</b>|$|E
500|$|The disease {{caused by}} Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is called <b>chytridiomycosis.</b> [...] Frogs {{infected}} by this disease generally show skin lesions and hyperkeratosis, {{and it is}} believed that death occurs because of interference with skin functions including maintenance of fluid balance, electrolyte homeostasis, respiration and role as a barrier to infections. The time from infection to death {{has been found to be}} 1–2 weeks in experimental tests, but infected animals can carry the fungus as long as 220 days. There are several hypotheses on the transmission and vectors of the fungus.|$|E
500|$|The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species {{considers}} the common toad as being of [...] "least concern". This {{is because it}} has a wide distribution and is, over most of its range, a common species. It is not particularly threatened by habitat loss because it is adaptable and is found in deciduous and coniferous forests, scrubland, meadows, parks and gardens. It prefers damp areas with dense foliage. The major threats it faces include loss of habitat locally, the drainage of wetlands where it breeds, agricultural activities, pollution and mortality on roads. <b>Chytridiomycosis,</b> an infectious disease of amphibians, has been reported in common toads in Spain and the United Kingdom and may affect some populations.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its collection, the herpetologists who later {{described}} Ecnomiohyla rabborum were already aware of the encroaching threat of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (colloquially referred to by biologists as [...] "Bd") in Panama. The fungus causes an infectious amphibian disease called <b>chytridiomycosis,</b> which has been linked to the massive decline and extinction of amphibian species in certain parts of the world; including the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Infected amphibians can display a wide variety of symptoms, usually including lethargic and abnormal behavior, convulsions, peeling skin, ulcers, and hemorrhaging; eventually resulting in death. The origin of the disease is unknown, but there is speculation that it may have been introduced throughout the world via importation of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis).|$|E
500|$|Amphibian {{populations in}} the {{beginning}} stages of decline often exude a number of signs, which may potentially {{be used to identify}} at-risk segments in conservation efforts. [...] One such sign is developmental instability, which has been proven as evidence of environmental stress. [...] This environmental stress can potentially raise susceptibility to diseases such as <b>chytridiomycosis,</b> and thus lead to amphibian declines. [...] In a study conducted in Queensland, Australia, for example, populations of two amphibian species, Litoria nannotis and Litoria genimaculata, were found to exhibit far greater levels of limb asymmetry in pre-decline years than in control years, the latter of which preceded die offs by an average of 16 years. [...] Learning to identify such signals in the critical period before population declines occur might greatly improve conservation efforts.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, a captive-breeding {{program was}} set up by the herpetofauna staff at Taronga Zoo in Sydney, {{sponsored}} by the ASX Frog Focus. The purpose of the program was to help preserve declining populations of green and golden bell frogs in the Sydney region. It involved the captive breeding of wild frogs and releasing large numbers of tadpoles back into the wild, habitat restoration, and monitoring after releases. The program was initially titled [...] "Frog Focus Botany", as Botany was the original focus site. Thousands of tadpoles were released into a site in Sir Joseph Banks Reserve and postrelease monitoring was done by the local community. It was also the first time that school students had been involved with endangered species monitoring. The program has since branched off into several other areas. Between 1998 and 2004, tadpoles were released into specially designed ponds and dams on Long Reef Golf Course at Collaroy in northern Sydney, with little success. Although green and golden bell frogs had previously been located in the area, the population had since been lost. Mature male bell frogs are occasionally found there; however, a permanent breeding population has yet to be established. An attempted reintroduction at Marrickville in inner-Sydney has failed due to <b>chytridiomycosis.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 2006, of 4,035 {{species of}} {{amphibians}} {{that depend on}} water during some lifecycle stage, 1,356 (33.6%) {{were considered to be}} threatened. This is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which evidence was insufficient to assess their status. Frog populations have declined dramatically since the 1950s. More than one-third of frog species are considered to be threatened with extinction, and more than 120 species are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. Among these species are the gastric-brooding frogs of Australia and the golden toad of Costa Rica. The latter is of particular concern to scientists because it inhabited the pristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve and its population crashed in 1987, along with about 20 other frog species in the area. This could not be linked directly to human activities, such as deforestation, and was outside the range of normal fluctuations in population size. Elsewhere, habitat loss is a significant cause of frog population decline, as are pollutants, climate change, increased UVB radiation, [...] and the introduction of non-native predators and competitors. A Canadian study conducted in 2006 suggested heavy traffic in their environment was a larger threat to frog populations than was habitat loss. Emerging infectious diseases, including <b>chytridiomycosis</b> [...] and ranavirus, are also devastating populations.|$|E
2500|$|The {{species has}} also been {{observed}} to be infected with the pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the disease <b>chytridiomycosis.</b> [...] Infection rates were approximately 40.0% among mature specimens and 53.5% among tadpoles. [...] B. dendrobatidis has had catastrophic effects on other Telmatobius species throughout the Andes region of South America: the extinction of three species from Ecuador {{has been linked to}} <b>chytridiomycosis</b> outbreaks, as has the decline of T. marmoratus and T. timens from Peru and three species from Argentina. [...] T. jelskii from Peru and T. gigas from Bolivia have also been affected by the fungus.|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{has four}} {{families}} of native frogs and one introduced toad, the cane toad. In 1935 the cane toad {{was introduced to}} Australia in a failed attempt to control pests in sugarcane crops. It has since become a devastating pest, spreading across northern Australia. As well as competing with native insectivores for food, the cane toad produces a venom that is toxic to native fauna, {{as well as to}} humans. The Myobatrachidae, or southern frogs, are Australia's largest group of frogs, with 112 species classified into anywhere from 17 to 22 genera. A notable member of this group is the colourful and endangered Corroboree frog. The tree frogs, from family Hylidae, are common in high rainfall areas on the north and east coasts; there are 77 Australian species from three genera. The 18 species from two genera of the Microhylidae frogs are restricted to the rainforests of northern Australia and nearby habitats; the smallest species, the scanty frog, is from this family. There is a single species from the world's dominant frog group, family Ranidae — the Australian wood frog — which only occurs in the Queensland rainforests. As elsewhere, there has been a precipitous decline in Australia's frog populations in recent years. [...] Although the full reasons for the decline are uncertain, it can be at least partly attributed to the fatal amphibian fungal disease <b>chytridiomycosis.</b> Another theory for the decline might be, as research shows, that species from the Southern Hemisphere are on average 4.6 million years old, compared to an average 2.9 million years old for the Northern Hemisphere: Researchers believe this age difference is because of the history of severe ice ages in the Northern Hemisphere, which may drive older species to extinction.|$|E

5000|$|Although unpublished, recent {{research}} suggests chloramphenicol {{could also be}} applied to frogs to prevent their widespread destruction from fungal infections. [...] It has recently been discovered to be a life-saving cure for <b>chytridiomycosis</b> in amphibians. <b>Chytridiomycosis</b> is a fungal disease, blamed for the extinction of one-third of the 120 frog species lost since 1980.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 {{a sample}} of {{peptides}} from nine different adult amphibians in Omar Torrijos National Park, Panama were taken to test for susceptibility to <b>Chytridiomycosis.</b> Of the 9 species test the H. Lemur ranked third in immunologic resistance {{with a mean of}} 15% in inhibition of pathogen growth and peptide renewal. The strongest (Xenopus Laevis) had a mean of 65% more than four times that of the H. Lemur. Although the H. Lemur shows some resiliance to <b>chytridiomycosis</b> it is not completely immune. In a different study following that, it was predicted that this species could survive <b>chytridiomycosis</b> because they contained dermaseptin-L1 and phylloseptin-L1 peptides which contained resistance to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. While there has been survivors, the appearance of <b>chytridiomycosis</b> still caused population decline despite their antimicrobial skin peptides. This shows that in-vitro studies may not represent what actually happens in living organisms.|$|E
50|$|Atelopus limosus is {{threatened}} by <b>chytridiomycosis</b> and habitat loss. Species have been rapidly declining throughout their range. About 75% of all known species from highland sites above 1000 m have disappeared, while 58% of lowland species have declined and 38% have disappeared. Worried {{about the effects of}} <b>chytridiomycosis</b> on this endemic Panamanian frog, the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project targeted A. limosus as a priority rescue species to be taken into captivity as an assurance colony at the Summit Municipal Park in Panama City. When the rescue team arrived at one of the last known upland sites at Cerro Brewster, they found many of the frogs were already infected with <b>chytridiomycosis.</b> The captive-breeding program has been successful. While the upland region seems to have been hard-hit by chytrid fungus, the fate of lowland populations of this species is uncertain, as <b>chytridiomycosis</b> appears to have more pronounced effects at upland sites.|$|E

50|$|Pristimantis caryophyllaceus is {{threatened}} by habitat loss and possibly <b>chytridiomycosis.</b> It has disappeared from lowland areas of Costa Rica.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{the effects}} of <b>chytridiomycosis</b> are seen most readily in Central America, eastern Australia, South America, and western North America.|$|E
5000|$|The bromeliad tree frog {{is listed}} as [...] "Least Concern" [...] in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. While it is a {{relatively}} rare species, it has quite large distribution area. However, it has declined at higher altitudes, possibly due to <b>chytridiomycosis.</b> In addition to <b>chytridiomycosis,</b> deforestation and pollution are believed to threaten this species. In Guatemala and Honduras, it occurs in several national parks, {{where it should be}} free of these threats.|$|E
50|$|The Trust has {{endangered}} the Mallorcan {{midwife toad}} in Spain by introducing the pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. The pathogen causes <b>chytridiomycosis,</b> {{which is now}} recognised as a principal driver of the mass extinction crisis in amphibians. The Trust's breeding facility in Jersey, {{that had been used}} for re-introduction of the species to its native habitat, has been identified as the source of <b>chytridiomycosis</b> which affects the Mallorcan midwife toad. It is the first case, where it could be shown that the anthropogenic movement of amphibians is spreading the fatal disease. The trust were however, successful in the mitigation of the impact of <b>chytridiomycosis</b> after a large scale re-introduction programme, and thanks to the work of Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the Mallorcan midwife toad became the only amphibian to be downgraded from Critically Endangered to Vulnerable.|$|E

50|$|The {{hypothesis}} that pesticide use {{has contributed to}} declining amphibian populations has been suggested {{several times in the}} literature. Interactions between pesticides and <b>chytridiomycosis</b> were examined in 2007, and sublethal exposure to the pesticide carbaryl (a cholinesterase inhibitor) was shown to increase susceptibility of foothill yellow-legged frogs (Rana boylii) to <b>chytridiomycosis.</b> In particular, the skin peptide defenses were significantly reduced after exposure to carbaryl, suggesting pesticides may inhibit this innate immune defence, and increase susceptibility to disease.|$|E
50|$|Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is a chytrid fungus {{that causes}} the disease <b>chytridiomycosis</b> in amphibians; frogs learn to avoid the fungus after just one exposure.|$|E
50|$|Craugastor anciano is an {{extremely}} rare species that might now be extinct. <b>Chytridiomycosis</b> is a possible reason, although also habitat loss is a threat.|$|E
