500|$|On May 1 at 1:22p.m., Panetta, {{acting on}} the president's orders, {{directed}} McRaven {{to move forward with}} the operation. Shortly after 3p.m., the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing {{in a corner of the}} screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room. In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop <b>computer</b> <b>operated</b> by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room, and described it like this: [...] "Contrary to some news reports and what you see in the movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day." [...] Two other command centers monitored the raid from the Pentagon and the American embassy in Islamabad.|$|E
