40|$|This is {{the first}} {{revision}} of the guidance document under the same title that was published by the Scottish Executive Health Department in 2002. The approach advocated for managing the risks to human and animal health of exposure to blue-green algal toxins continues to centre on production and implementation of “Local Action Plans”. These should be co-ordinated by the NHS Boards in Scotland and should be agreed by the various stakeholders identified herein. This document includes guidance on the content and structure of these Local Action Plans and {{should be regarded as}} a resource to assist in their production, as well as fulfilling the requirements of Article 8 (<b>Cyanobacterial</b> <b>risks)</b> of the Bathing Waters Directive(2006 / 7 /EC). The Scottish Executive Health Department (SEHD) proposes to review and, if necessary, reissue this guidance document every five years. However, it is recognized that the value of this guidance lies in its practical implementation. The SEHD would therefore welcome feedback, which should be addressed to the SEHD’s Scientific Adviser at St Andrew‘s House, Edinburgh EH 13 DG. Should this feedback indicate a specific need, then a further version of this guidance will be produced sooner...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{populations of}} toxic {{cyanobacteria}} in recreational waters can present a serious risk to human health. Intelligence on the abundance {{and distribution of}} cyanobacteria is therefore needed to aid risk assessment and management activities. In this paper, we use data from the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager- 2 (CASI- 2) to monitor seasonal change in the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and the cyanobacterial biomarker pigment C-phycocyanin (C-PC) {{in a series of}} shallow lakes in the UK. The World Health Organization guidance levels for cyanobacteria in recreational waters were subsequently used to build a decision tree classification model for cyanobacterial risk assessment which was driven using Chl a and C-PC products derived from the CASI- 2 data. The results demonstrate that remote sensing can be used to acquire intelligence on the distribution and abundance of cyanobacteria in inland waterbodies. It is argued the use of remote sensing reconnaissance, in conjunction with in situ based monitoring approaches, would greatly aid the assessment of <b>cyanobacterial</b> <b>risks</b> in inland waters and improve our ability to protect human health.

40|$|Mass {{populations of}} toxin-producing {{cyanobacteria}} commonly develop in fresh-, brackish- and marine waters and effective strategies for monitoring and managing <b>cyanobacterial</b> health <b>risks</b> {{are required to}} safeguard animal and human health. A multi-interdisciplinary study, including two UK freshwaters {{with a history of}} toxic cyanobacterial blooms, was undertaken to explore different approaches for the identification, monitoring and management of potentially-toxic cyanobacteria and their associated risks. The results demonstrate that (i) cyanobacterial bloom occurrence can be predicted at a local- and national-scale using process-based and statistical models; (ii) cyanobacterial concentration and distribution in waterbodies can be monitored using remote sensing, but minimum detection limits need to be evaluated; (iii) cyanotoxins may be transferred to spray-irrigated root crops; and (iv) attitudes and perceptions towards risks influence the public's preferences and willingness-to-pay for <b>cyanobacterial</b> health <b>risk</b> reductions in recreational waters...|$|R
40|$|A Bayesian {{network model}} was {{developed}} to assess the combined influence of nutrient conditions and climate on the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms within lakes of diverse hydrology and nutrient supply. Physicochemical, biological, and meteorological observations were collated from 20 lakes located at different latitudes and characterized by a range of sizes and trophic states. Using these data, we built a Bayesian network to (1) analyze the sensitivity of cyanobacterial bloom development to different environmental factors and (2) determine the probability that cyanobacterial blooms would occur. Blooms were classified in three categories of hazard (low, moderate, and high) based on cell abundances. The most important factors determining cyanobacterial bloom occurrence were water temperature, nutrient availability, and the ratio of mixing depth to euphotic depth. The probability of cyanobacterial blooms was evaluated under different combinations of total phosphorus and water temperature. The Bayesian network was then applied to quantify the probability of blooms under a future climate warming scenario. The probability of the "high hazardous" category of cyanobacterial blooms increased 5 % in response to either an increase in water temperature of 0. 8 °C (initial water temperature above 24 °C) or an increase in total phosphorus from 0. 01 mg/L to 0. 02 mg/L. Mesotrophic lakes were particularly vulnerable to warming. Reducing nutrient concentrations counteracts the increased <b>cyanobacterial</b> <b>risk</b> associated with higher temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Modification of lake {{heat budget}} {{due to global}} warming has {{consequences}} for water quality, biogeochemistry and lake habitat. A major concern is that an intensification of heating will increase thermal stratification within lakes favouring {{the development of the}} buoyant bloom-forming cyanobacteria. The toxicity of cyanobacteria represents a risk that has to be assessed and managed at different latitudes and with different land use. The aim of the research, currently in progress, is to determine how <b>cyanobacterial</b> <b>risk</b> may change with climate change. Different lakes may have different sensitivity to cyanobacteria and climate change, which may be a function of latitude, nutrient loading and lake size. Further objectives are to determine the factors leading to cyanobacterial blooms, determine if these factors are common across all lake types and latitudes, and to predict how cyanobacteria risk may change. The objectives will be achieved adopting a multiple approach: (1) applying a statistical Bayesian model to a data set that includes lakes and reservoirs with different ecological states and located at different latitudes and (2) using a predictive coupled climate-hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model to assess cyanobacteria risk under different scenarios. The simulations will enable a risk profile of lakes around the globe to identify the lake types that are most sensitive to cyanobacterial blooms at present and in the face of climate change.

40|$|The wide {{distribution}} of cyanobacteria in aquatic environments {{leads to the}} risk of water contamination by cyanotoxins, which generate environmental and public health issues. Measurements of cell densities or pigment contents allow both the early detection of cellular growth and bloom monitoring, but these methods are not sufficiently accurate to predict actual <b>cyanobacterial</b> <b>risk.</b> To quantify cyanotoxins, analytical methods are considered the gold standards, but they are laborious, expensive, time-consuming and available in a limited number of laboratories. In cyanobacterial species with toxic potential, cyanotoxin production is restricted to some strains, and blooms can contain varying proportions of both toxic and non-toxic cells, which are morphologically indistinguishable. The sequencing of cyanobacterial genomes led to the description of gene clusters responsible for cyanotoxin production, which {{paved the way for the}} use of these genes as targets for PCR and then quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thus, the quantification of cyanotoxin genes appeared as a new method for estimating the potential toxicity of blooms. This raises a question concerning whether qPCR-based methods would be a reliable indicator of toxin concentration in the environment. Here, we review studies that report the parallel detection of microcystin genes and microcystin concentrations in natural populations and also a smaller number of studies dedicated to cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin. We discuss the possible issues associated with the contradictory findings reported to date, present methodological limitations and consider the use of qPCR as an indicator of cyanotoxin risk...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} field {{campaign was}} carried out for the validation of a previously published reflectance ratio-based algorithm for quantification of the cyanobacterial pigment phycocyanin (PC). The algorithm uses band settings of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard ENVISAT, and should accurately retrieve the PC concentration in turbid, cyanobacteria-dominated waters. As algae and cyanobacteria often co-occur, the algorithm response to varying phytoplankton composition was explored. Remote sensing reflectance and reference pigment measurements were obtained in the period 2001 – 2005 in Spain and the Netherlands using field spectroradiometry and various pigment extraction methods. Additional field data was collected in Spain in May 2005 to allow intercalibration of spectroradiometry and pigment assessment methods. Two methods for extraction of PC from concentrated water samples, and in situ measured PC fluorescence, compared well. Reflectance measurements with different field spectroradiometers used in Spain and the Netherlands also gave similar results. Residual analysis of PC predicted by the algorithm showed that overestimation of PC mainly occurred {{in the presence of}} chlorophylls b and c, and phaeophytin. The errors were strongest at low PC relative to Chl a concentrations. A correction applied for absorption by Chl b markedly improved the prediction. Without such a correction, the quality of the PC prediction still increased markedly with estimates > 50 mg PC m− 3, allowing monitoring of the cyanobacterial status of eutrophic waters. The threshold concentration may be lowered when a high intracellular PC:Chl a ratio or cyanobacterial dominance is expected. Below the limit, predicted PC concentrations should be considered as the highest estimate. We evaluated that remote sensing of both PC and Chl a would allow assessment of <b>cyanobacterial</b> <b>risk</b> to water quality and public health in over 70 % of our cases. ...|$|R
