Ceramic glaze often <b>contains</b> <b>lead,</b> and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food <b>contains</b> <b>lead.</b> When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. People who eat animals hunted with lead bullets {{may be at risk}} for lead exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E
25|$|The {{groundwater}} <b>contains</b> <b>lead</b> {{and volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) like benzene, xylene, and toluene. Several areas of underground petroleum-contaminated soil and floating petroleum product are the sources of continuing groundwater contamination. Ingesting or coming into direct contact with contaminated groundwater or soil can pose a potential health threat. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated fish were {{also found in the}} area. Construction of the superfund site was complete in 1998.|$|E
25|$|All mountain-building strata {{consists}} of sedimentary rocks of the Mesozoic era, that were originally laid {{down on the}} seabed. The base of the mountain comprises muschelkalk beds; its upper layers are made of Wetterstein limestone. With steep rock walls up to 800metres high, it is this Wetterstein limestone from the Upper Triassic that is mainly responsible for the rock faces, arêtes, pinnacles and the summit rocks of the mountain. Due to the frequent occurrence of marine coralline algae in the Wetterstein limestone it can be deduced that this rock was at one time formed in a lagoon. The colour of the rock varies between grey-white and light grey to speckled. In several places it <b>contains</b> <b>lead</b> and zinc ore. These minerals were mined between 1827 and 1918 in the Höllental valley. The dark grey, almost horizontal and partly grass-covered layers of muschelkalk run from {{the foot of the}} Great Riffelwandspitze to the Ehrwalder Köpfe. From the appearance of the north face of the Zugspitze {{it can be seen that}} this massif originally consisted of two mountain ranges that were piled on top of one another.|$|E
