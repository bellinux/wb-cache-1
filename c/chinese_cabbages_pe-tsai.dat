Physiochemical, sensory, and functional characteristics of these types of kimchi were compared and analyzed according to the passage of ripening. ResultsIn general nutritional ingredients according to agricultural differences, the YC-Control showed high contents in moisture, crude protein, and crude fat. YC-FNC and YC-GC showed high contents in total dietary fibers, vitamin C, and phytochemicals significantly (p <  0. 01). In inorganic matter YC-FNC and YC-GC had high contents of P, Ca, Mg, and Fe and YC-Control had high contents of N, K, Cu, Mn, and Zn significantly (p <  0. 01). YC-Control had a higher rate in approaching the optimum ripening period, pH 4. 96, than YC-FNC and YC-GC. Then, it was verified that the ripening of YC-FNC and YC-GC is gradually processed.

Rupr. and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.). Feeding ranking preferences were <b>Chinese</b> <b>cabbage,</b> mustard, wild radish, arugula and watercress (7. 97, 1. 85, 0. 98, 0. 36 and 0. 11 mm², respectively). Feeding on <b>Chinese</b> <b>cabbage</b> was 4. 31 times more intense than on mustard. The same experiment was repeated with one adult per dish. Responses of males and females were quite similar. Feeding was higher on mustard (87. 2 and 142. 8 for males and females, respectively). Feeding on arugula (51. 5 and 132. 7) and <b>Chinese</b> <b>cabbage</b> (51. 8 and 89. 0) were intermediate. Watercress (22. 96 and 39. 3) and wild radish (12. 03 and 28. 4) were the least preferred host plants. In a third experiment, ten larvae per dish were used and spinach, Tetragonia expansa Murr., radish, Raphanus sativus L. and collard, B. oleracea var. acephala L., were also included. Daily larval frequencies on each food were also measured. Feeding was similar on <b>Chinese</b> <b>cabbage</b> and mustard (47. 89 and 53. 78, respectively). Number of insects was greater on mustard, <b>Chinese</b> <b>cabbage</b> and wild radish. Probable explanations for results and proposals for further investigations are discussed...|$|R
