However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg.

5|$|Ostrach {{was a small}} village, with a {{population}} of 300. The village belonged to the Cistercian Imperial Abbey of Salem, an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on Lake Constance. The village was largely dedicated to farming, although a stretch of the imperial post road connected it and Pfullendorf. A wide, flat plain, marshy in places, stretched between the base of the Pfullendorf heights and the village; low lying hills ringed the valley, which was <b>creased</b> by a small stream from which the village takes its name. Ostrach itself lies almost at the northern end of this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. The two armies faced each other across this small and, at that time of that year, very soggy valley.|$|E

40|$|Ensuring {{uniformity}} in the nomenclature {{standardization of}} facial <b>creases</b> {{is important to}} enable the scholarly community to follow and debate the advancements in research. This review highlights the prevailing disparity in the nomenclature that refers to the same facial <b>crease</b> by researchers and laypeople, and suggests uniform names for the facial <b>creases</b> based on available literature. The previous and current trends in facial <b>crease</b> classification are also discussed. The nomenclature of the facial <b>creases</b> considered for this review include the following: the nasolabial fold, corner of the mouth lines, upper and lower lip <b>creases</b> around the mouth region, the mandibular folds, the bifid nose, the transverse nasal line, the vertical glabellar line, chin <b>crease,</b> the mental <b>crease,</b> four type of <b>creases</b> around the eyes, forehead <b>creases,</b> and periauricular <b>creases.</b> A figure illustrating the above facial <b>creases</b> is included as reference.

40|$|Palm <b>creases</b> {{are helpful}} in {{revealing}} anthropologic characteristics and diagnosing chromosomal aberrations, {{and have been}} analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. However, previous methods of analyzing palm <b>creases</b> were not objective so that reproducibility could not be guaranteed. In this study, a more objective morphologic analysis of palm <b>creases</b> was developed. The features of the improved methods include the strict definition of major and minor palm <b>creases</b> and the systematic classification of major palm <b>creases</b> based on their relationships, branches, and variants. Furthermore, based on the analysis of 3, 216 Koreans, palm <b>creases</b> were anthropologically interpreted. There was a tendency for palm <b>creases</b> to be evenly distributed on the palm, which was acknowledged by the relationship between major and minor <b>creases</b> {{as well as by}} the incidences of major <b>creases</b> types. This tendency was consistent with the role of palm <b>creases</b> to facilitate folding of palm skin. The union of major palm <b>creases</b> was frequent in males and right palms to have powerful hand grip.

Modern lapels are largely identical in form to their 1930s counterparts.|$|E

500|$|An {{alternative}} {{proof of}} sufficiency {{can be used}} to show that there are many different flat foldings. Consider the smallest angle [...] and the two <b>creases</b> on either side of it. Mountain-fold one of these two <b>creases</b> and valley-fold the other, choosing arbitrarily which fold to use for which <b>crease.</b> Then, glue the resulting flap of paper onto the remaining part of the <b>crease</b> pattern. The result of this gluing will be a <b>crease</b> pattern with two fewer <b>creases,</b> on a conical sheet of paper, that still satisfies Kawasaki's condition. Therefore, by mathematical induction, repeating this process will eventually lead to a flat folding. The base case of the induction is a cone with only two <b>creases</b> and two equal-angle wedges, which can obviously be flat-folded by using a mountain fold for both <b>creases.</b> There are two ways to choose which folds to use in each step of this method, and each step eliminates two <b>creases.</b> Therefore, any <b>crease</b> pattern with [...] <b>creases</b> that satisfies Kawasaki's condition has at least [...] different choices of mountain and valley folds that all lead to valid flat foldings.|$|R

The bowling <b>creases</b> lie 22 yards (66 feet or 20.12 m) away, and marks the other end of the pitch. For the fielding side, the <b>crease</b> defines whether there is a no ball because a fielder has encroached on the pitch or the wicket-keeper has moved in front of the wicket before he is permitted to do so. In addition, historically part of the bowler's back foot in the delivery stride was required to fall behind the bowling <b>crease</b> to avoid a delivery being a no ball. This rule was replaced by a requirement that part of the bowler's front foot in the delivery stride must fall behind the popping <b>crease</b> (see below).|$|R

40|$|<b>Creasing</b> is {{a process}} which indents a section of {{corrugated}} board along fold lines to facilitate a neat fold. The most common failure site in a box made out of corrugated board is at the folds, where the stiffness is reduced by the <b>creasing</b> operation. <b>Crease</b> depth is an important parameter to be controlled. If the <b>crease</b> is too shallow, the section will crack during folding due to excessive strain on the outer liner. On the other hand, if the <b>crease</b> is too deep, the board may crack during the <b>creasing</b> operation itself or it may fail during handling due to excessive reduction in local strength along the fold line. A {{review of the literature}} reveals that only a limited amount of research has been carried out on experimental <b>creasing</b> of corrugated boards and comparison with numerical analyses. However, modelling of paper for corrugated board has been successfully done using Hill's plasticity model. In this work, experimental investigations on <b>creasing</b> of corrugated paperboard are carried out. These are complemented by finite element simulations of the <b>creasing</b> process.
