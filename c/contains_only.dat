40|$|In this research, we varied the {{composition}} of 4 -member groups. One third of the groups consisted exclusively of "locomotors," individuals predominantly oriented toward action. Another third of the groups consisted exclusively of "assessors," individuals predominantly oriented toward evaluation. The final third of the groups consisted of a mix of locomotors and assessors. We found that the groups <b>containing</b> <b>only</b> locomotors were faster than the groups <b>containing</b> <b>only</b> assessors, and the groups <b>containing</b> <b>only</b> assessors were more accurate than the groups <b>containing</b> <b>only</b> locomotors. The groups containing a mix of assessors and locomotors were {{as fast as the}} groups <b>containing</b> <b>only</b> locomotors and as accurate as the groups <b>containing</b> <b>only</b> assessors. These results echo findings at the individual level of analysis, and suggest that the testing and action components of operating systems independently contribute to performance both intra- and interpersonally...|$|R

5|$|Both {{stable and}} {{unstable}} isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It {{is believed that}} most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust. Primordial beryllium <b>contains</b> <b>only</b> one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element.|$|E

Debian includes popular free programs such as LibreOffice, Firefox web browser, Evolution mail, K3b disc burner, VLC media player, GIMP image editor, and Evince document viewer. Debian is a popular choice for web servers (cf. LAMP).|$|E
5|$|It is even {{possible}} {{that in any}} one generation no marbles of a particular colour are chosen, meaning they have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, the jar representing the new generation <b>contains</b> <b>only</b> blue offspring. If this happens, the red allele has been lost permanently in the population, while the remaining blue allele has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, fixation can occur {{in just a few}} generations.|$|E
5|$|Motif finding, {{also known}} as profile analysis, is a method of {{locating}} sequence motifs in global MSAs that is both a means of producing a better MSA and a means of producing a scoring matrix for use in searching other sequences for similar motifs. A variety of methods for isolating the motifs have been developed, but {{all are based on}} identifying short highly conserved patterns within the larger alignment and constructing a matrix similar to a substitution matrix that reflects the amino acid or nucleotide composition of each position in the putative motif. The alignment can then be refined using these matrices. In standard profile analysis, the matrix includes entries for each possible character as well as entries for gaps. Alternatively, statistical pattern-finding algorithms can identify motifs as a precursor to an MSA rather than as a derivation. In many cases when the query set <b>contains</b> <b>only</b> a small number of sequences or <b>contains</b> <b>only</b> highly related sequences, pseudocounts are added to normalize the distribution reflected in the scoring matrix. In particular, this corrects zero-probability entries in the matrix to values that are small but nonzero.|$|E

5|$|The Ixodidae {{contains}} over 700 {{species of}} hard ticks with a scutum or hard shield, which the Argasidae lack. The Argasidae contains about 200 species; the genera accepted as of 2010 are Antricola, Argas, Nothoaspis, Ornithodoros and Otobius. They have no scutum, and the capitulum (mouth and feeding parts) is concealed beneath the body. The family Nuttalliellidae <b>contains</b> <b>only</b> a single species, Nuttalliella namaqua, a tick found in southern Africa from Tanzania to Namibia and South Africa.|$|E

5|$|The skin of {{crocodilians}} {{is thick}} and cornified, and is clad in non-overlapping scales known as scutes, arranged in regular rows and patterns.

The outer surface of the scutes consists of the relatively rigid beta-keratin while the hinge region between the scutes <b>contains</b> <b>only</b> the more pliable alpha-keratin.|$|E

5|$|Adler's memoirs were {{published}} in the New York socialist Yiddish-language newspaper Die Varheit in 1916–1919, and briefly resumed in 1925 in an unsuccessful revival of that paper; his granddaughter Lulla Rosenfeld's English translation was published only in 1999. The 1916–1919 portion of the memoir gives a detailed picture of his Russian years. The 1925 portion gives a comparably detailed picture of his time in London, although with some evasions around the relative timing of his relationships with his wife Sonya and with Jennya Kaiser and Dinah Shtettin. It <b>contains</b> <b>only</b> a relatively fragmentary description of his New York career. In the English-language book of these memoirs, Rosenfeld attempts to fill the gaps with her own commentary.|$|E
