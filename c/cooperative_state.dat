The origin is assumed for superradiance {{in a system of}} molecules where no mutual interactions exist, but all of the molecules encounter the same field of radiation. A phasing operator as Phi(sub Nu) equals D(alpha) + P(sub Nu) D(alpha), where D(alpha) is the displacing operator and P(sub Nu) the projection operator for constant energy Nu for two oscillators, was derived. The eigenstates of the phasing operator Phi are found to show a finite correlation as in the Dicke <b>cooperative</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R

40|$|What {{determines the}} price of {{membership}} in an internationalinstitution? Barbara Koremenos, Charles Lipson, and Duncan Snidalhypothesize that uncertainty about the preferences of other states willincrease that price, as stated in Rational Design conjecture M 2,restrictive MEMBERSHIP will increase with UNCERTAINTY ABOUTPREFERENCES. When states are uncertain about the motivations of other states, theywill demand costly signals of reassurance before being willing tocooperate fully. 1 In a multilateral context, thismay {{take the form of}} aninstitution with a signi cant barrier to entry, a price of admission. The price of admission serves to separate states who are seriouslyinterested in cooperation from those who have more exploitativemotivations. More <b>cooperative</b> <b>states</b> will be willing to pay the price,and this will reveal their cooperative nature to others, facilitatingcooperation. Less <b>cooperative</b> <b>states</b> will not be willing to pay theprice, and this too will reveal their type, leading others to cooperateless with them. ...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{sanctions}} are a coercive diplomacy tool often used by sender states to elicit behavioral {{change in the}} target state. Prior research focused on the domestic elements of the target state, thus this research tests the cooperative theory in which {{the focus is on}} the international behavior of the target state when assessing the effectiveness of economic sanctions. The research question driving this thesis is: are economic sanctions more effective in a non-cooperative authoritarian <b>state</b> or a <b>cooperative</b> authoritarian <b>state?</b> The two case studies are China (<b>cooperative</b> authoritarian <b>state)</b> and Iran (non-cooperative authoritarian state). Through five mechanisms, budget of the target state, opposition within the target state, type of sanction, commitment of the sender state, and dependence of the target state on the international community, the effectiveness of the sanctions is analyzed. Noticeably there is a stronger link between effective sanctions and the <b>cooperative</b> authoritarian <b>state</b> (China) in comparison with the non-cooperative authoritarian state (Iran), the international mechanisms mostly drive the effectiveness of the sanctions in the <b>cooperative</b> authoritarian <b>state,</b> and neo-realism is a very noticeable factor in utilizing economic sanctions...|$|R

40|$|This honors thesis {{considers}} the main lines of agrarian transformation in Mozambique {{in the context}} of two major political and social transitions: from the period of late colonial rule to the post-independence socialist oriented policies under The Liberation Front of Mozambique (Frelimo); and from the latter to the market oriented set of policies that became dominant in the post-Cold War era. The primary focus is on the transition from socialist policies characterized by the creation of <b>cooperatives,</b> <b>state</b> farms, and communal villages; to market-led transformations characterized by a system of private property in land and a system of production and exchange for the market. In the process, I look at the IMF-imposed Structural Adjustment Program and the civil war with the Renamo (The Mozambican National Resistance) movement that was armed and backed by apartheid South Africa, in shaping the nature of this transition. 	I find that the creation of <b>cooperatives,</b> <b>state</b> farms, and communal villages was not successful at integrating peasants and bringing together communities to increase production largely because the policies implemented did not reflect the needs and desires of the peasantry. They often were inimical to the situation many peasants found themselves in. I also find that the liberalization of the economy was laden with policies that were unfavorable to the peasantry. The privatization of the <b>cooperatives</b> and <b>state</b> farms was accompanied by the reduction of state funded projects such as the development of rural infrastructures and road networks that are crucial in linking peasants to marketplaces. 	In the future, Mozambique will need to empower local communities and develop rural markets and infrastructure if it is to increase production and generate a positive dynamic of development that can improve rural peoples livelihood and decrease levels of poverty...|$|R
