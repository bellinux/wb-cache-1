5|$|Originally the {{unlimited}} company Bjorøy og Tyssøy ANS {{had been}} attempted established with capital from locals, but instead the company Fastlandssambandet Bjorøy – Tyssøy AS was established on 29 September 1993. Capital for NOK40,000 was paid by Fjell Municipality, NOK20,000 by Sund Municipality and NOK10,000 by Jack Jahnsen. The plans {{were sent to}} the Ministry of Transport and Communications in October 1992, who started working on a proposal for parliament in January 1993. Issues raised by the ministry were that the loans had been issued in 1987, and whether the land estimated value of the guaranteed real estate was real. The project was presented to the Parliament of Norway, who must approve all toll roads. By then the costs were estimated at NOK61.5 million, including NOK4.5 million in ordinary county grants and NOK30 million in extraordinary county grants. The proposal estimated annual toll <b>collection</b> <b>costs</b> to NOK825,000, with the collection taking place on Bjorøy. It was originally planned that the toll plaza would be manned between 06:00 and 22:00, meaning passing would be free at night.|$|E
25|$|Solid waste {{management}} budgeted $33.4 million {{in fiscal year}} 2008/9 for county waste, not including municipalities which contract separately. In 2017, the county served about 97,000 residences. It charged $128.21 annually to pick up waste curbside. Of concern, was a $1.2 million reserve for extra removal of wastes resulting from hurricanes. This was considered too low. The deficiency was magnified {{by the fact that}} <b>collection</b> <b>costs</b> more than customers are being charged.|$|E
25|$|Container deposit {{legislation}} involves {{offering a}} refund {{for the return}} of certain containers, typically glass, plastic, and metal. When a product in such a container is purchased, a small surcharge is added to the price. This surcharge can be reclaimed by the consumer if the container is returned to a collection point. These programs have been very successful, often resulting in an 80 percent recycling rate. Despite such good results, the shift in <b>collection</b> <b>costs</b> from local government to industry and consumers has created strong opposition to the creation of such programs in some areas. A variation on this is where the manufacturer bears responsibility for the recycling of their goods. In the European Union, the WEEE Directive requires producers of consumer electronics to reimburse the recyclers' costs.|$|E

25|$|The Panic of 1837 hit the {{following}} year, causing a sharp decrease in tax revenues, {{even as the}} state budget was already faced a large deficit because of the interest on the debt. Property taxes were the state's primary regular income, and to increase the revenue Noble proposed that the tax be levied ad valorem. The change would save the state a significant amount in administrative and <b>collection</b> <b>costs,</b> and make more land subject to taxation. The tax was approved {{and led to a}} 25% increase in revenue {{the following}} year, but it was still not enough to cover the deficit. Noble proposed the projects be prioritized, and work halted on the less important ones to conserve funds, but the plan was rejected. By the time Noble left office, the state's financial situation was bleak, but it was not yet fully apparent that far more had been borrowed than could be paid back. Despite the dire situation, Noble left office in 1837 as a popular political figure and was able to use his prestige to help elect David Wallace, his lieutenant governor, as governor.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2002 Metro Manila Solid Waste Management Report of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Valenzuela has {{the highest}} number of {{identified}} recycling companies in the region. It was also said that recycling centers related to plastic materials are relatively higher than other recyclable objects like metals, paper, glass among others. Accordingly, the city government allocates an amount of about 785.70 Philippine pesos (approx. US$18 as of April 2011) for every transportation and <b>collection</b> <b>costs</b> of a ton of waste material. In 2003, the city generated about 307.70 tons of waste every day. In 2001, it was reported by ADB that the city has as high as 25% solid waste management cost recovery rate through service charges on households and other enterprises for operational activities associated with waste collection, treatment and disposal. That same year, the city's proposal to implement a community-based solid waste management project in barangay Mapulang Lupa, was approved by the national government, which involves social mobilization, training of personnel, implementation of segregated collection and establishment of materials recovery facility and windows composting operation among others. The city government was granted a maximum of US$25,000 from Asian Development Bank for the operation of the project.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dramatic}} {{decrease in}} evasion {{during this period}} coincided with a reinvigorated Transit Police, a 25% expansion of City police, and a general drop in crime in U.S. cities. In the city, crime rate decline begun in 1991 under Mayor David Dinkins and continued through next two decades under Mayors Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg. Some observers credited the “broken windows” approach of law enforcement [...] where minor crimes like evasion are routinely prosecuted, and statistical crimefighting tools, whereas others have indicated different reasons for crime reduction. Regardless of causality, evasion checks resulted in many arrests for outstanding warrants or weapons charges, likely contributing somewhat to public safety improvements. Arrests weren’t {{the only way to}} combat evasions, and by the early 1990s NYCTA was examining methods to improve fare control passenger throughputs, reduce fare <b>collection</b> <b>costs,</b> and maintain control over evasions and general grime. The AFC system was being designed, and evasion-preventing capability was a key consideration.|$|E

Whereas there is no consideration for this in-network processing in current WSN protocols based on industrial application. Clustering sensor nodes is an effective technique to achieve in-network aggregation in WSNs. The goal {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate how judicious selection of a few aggregators from the sensor nodes can significantly reduce the data <b>collection</b> <b>cost.</b> The problem resembles the classical multi-objective network location problem. For large network, this paper shows an approximate algorithm which provides a suboptimal solution.

2500|$|Costs were {{controlled}} during construction {{and operation of}} the system by going with the lowest bidder and using relatively cheap, commercially available technology without regard for [...] "buy Canadian" [...] policies. This has worked out well for a pioneer system because the German technology chosen has since become {{a more or less}} standard design for most North American LRT systems, and compatible new-generation equipment with new features is available off-the-shelf. [...] A grade-separated system was passed over in preference for a system with few elevated or buried segments, and the trains and stations selected were of the tried and tested, utilitarian variety (for example, vehicles were not air conditioned, storage yards were not automated, and stations were usually modest concrete platforms with a shelter overhead). [...] This allowed greater amounts of track to be laid within available budgets. The CTrain reduced fare <b>collection</b> <b>costs</b> by using an honour system of payment. Transit police check passenger tickets at random, and fines are set at a level high enough that those who are caught pay the costs for those who evade detection. Staffing costs were kept low by employing a minimum number of workers, and because the system is all-electric (wind powered) it can run all night with only 1 driver per train and 2 people in the control room. It now runs 22 hours per day without significantly increased overhead. (The other 2 hours are reserved for track maintenance).|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{designing}} practical, energy-efficient protocols for data collection in wireless sensor networks using predictive modeling. Prior work has suggested several approaches to capture and exploit the rich spatio-temporal correlations prevalent in WSNs during data collection. Although shown to be effective in reducing the data <b>collection</b> <b>cost,</b> those approaches use simplistic corelation models and further, ignore many idiosyncrasies of WSNs, in particular the broadcast nature of communication. Our proposed approach is based on approximating the joint probability distribution over the sensors using undirected graphical models, ideally suited to exploit both the spatial correlations and the broadcast nature of communication. We present algorithms for optimally using such a model for data collection under different communication models, and for identifying an appropriate model to use for a given sensor network. Experiments over synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach significantly reduces the data <b>collection</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R

The {{results showed that the}} average storage and transportation costs of these three were 148. 5 yuan&# 183;t - 1 for the wheat and 116. 8 yuan&# 183;t - 1 for rice, the cost of wheat straw was higher than that of rice straw. In the storage and transportation cost of wheat, field <b>collection</b> <b>cost</b> took 52 %, transportation cost took 21 % and storage cost took 27 % while the percentages were 48 %, 21 % and 31 % respectively for rice. So the field <b>collection</b> <b>cost</b> was the highest, followed by the storage cost and the transportation cost. According to the cost analysis, it was concluded that the mechanized bundling and loading operation under the condition of the straw field collection operation would greatly reduce the <b>collection</b> <b>cost</b> and improve the collection efficiency. In the process of transportation, it was more cost-effective to use high-capacity truck than farm tractor, and to save the cost of vehicle purchase than renting. In storage operation, low-cost land should be selected; on the other hand, the flow rate of straw preprocessing should be increased to reduce the straw loss of storage.
