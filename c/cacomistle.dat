25|$|Most of {{the wild}} {{vegetation}} of the area is that of grassland with very little forest mostly due to {{a long history of}} agriculture in the area. One of the few forested areas is the Ayaquemetl mountain is near San Nicolás Tetelco with about ten hectares. There have been some efforts at reforestation. However, most of the plant life is the growing of crops, especially in the east and south growing corn, spinach, other leafy greens, alfalfa, figs, pears, and walnuts. There is also significant aquatic vegetation such as water lilies, chichicastle and ninfa. Most {{of the wild}}life of the area has been extinguished because of human encroachment but in the Santa Catarina mountains there are still badgers, <b>cacomistle</b> and bats as well as various kinds of rodents and birds found throughout the borough.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance {{issues have}} closed {{parts of the}} park from time to time. In 1985, the parked was closed to exterminate rats and other pests. In 2005, the park was filled with trees in poor condition, scum in the lakes, and had trash piles in several locations, {{including}} fountains. From that year until 2010, the park was closed section by section for restoration and rehabilitation projects. The first section was closed for eight months in 2005, for work that included dredging lakes, pruning and removing trees, picking up tons of debris, and expelling hundreds of vendors. Shortly thereafter, projects on {{the second and third}} sections of the park began, mostly to control or eliminate rats, feral dogs and cats, pigeons and other introduced species. In 2005, migratory birds began to make a comeback at the park with the eradication and relocation of introduced species such as geese and ducks, which were aggressive to other species. The park hosts more than 100 species of this kind of bird, with some reproducing {{here for the first time}} in decades. Other native mammals returned in 2005, including the tlacuache and the <b>cacomistle.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{vegetation}} consists of mesquite (prosopis spp) {{along with some}} pine-holm oak forest {{in the east and}} desert scrub brush on the extreme south. Other plants that {{can be found in the}} municipality include palo bobo (Tessaria integrifolia), uña de gato, huisache (Vachellia farnesiana), granjeno, [...] palo sishote as well as nopal, wild oregano and barrel cactus. Wildlife is mostly limited to that which can live in arid conditions such as doves, turtledoves, quail, rabbits, squirrels, skunks, weasels, <b>cacomistle,</b> raccoons, badgers, coyotes, foxes, armadillos and various types of snakes including the coral snake and the rattlesnake. In the La Higuera and Río Blanco rivers there are various types of fish such as trout, tilapia, catfish and carp. In the forested areas, there are white-tailed deer, temazate (Mazama temama), wild boar, and pumas.|$|E

50|$|Procyonidae {{includes}} the raccoons, coatis, kinkajous, olingos, ringtails and <b>cacomistles.</b> Procyonids inhabit {{a wide range}} of environments, and are generally omnivorous.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cacomistles</b> are {{considered}} generalist feeders, {{because they can}} survive {{on a wide variety}} of different foods. [...] The diet of this species consists primarily of fruits, insects, small vertebrates such as reptiles, amphibians, and rodents, the specificity of these food options depends on what is available in the particular habitat in which an individual dwells. The bromeliad is an excellent reservoir for food in the southern edge of the <b>cacomistle's</b> range, as these plants naturally collect water, insects and small animals found high in the canopy.|$|R
50|$|The <b>cacomistle</b> {{is part of}} {{the family}} Procyonidae which {{includes}} other small omnivores such as the raccoon and the coati. The <b>cacomistle</b> and its close relative, the ringtail, are the only living species of the subfamily Procyoninae and the genus Bassariscus. Within the <b>Cacomistle</b> species there are 5 subspecies (Bassariscus sumichrasti variabilis, Bassariscus sumichrasti sumichrasti, Bassariscus sumichrasti oaxacensis, Bassariscus sumichrasti notinus, and Bassariscus sumichrasti latrans).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cacomistle</b> inhabits the {{tropical}} forests of Central America, from south central Mexico to Panama. These animals are quite solitary and thus spread themselves out, with each <b>cacomistle</b> having a home range {{of at least}} 20 hectares (an area equivalent to 20 sports fields [...] )and are typically seen {{in the middle and}} upper levels of the canopy. Throughout their broad range this species is found to inhabit a wide variety of different forests ecosystems. In Mexico the <b>cacomistle</b> tends to avoid oak forest, secondary forest, and overgrown pastures, but in Costa Rica the <b>cacomistle</b> has been shown to favor those exact habitats.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cacomistle,</b> Bassariscus sumichrasti, {{a member}} of the carnivoran family Procyonidae ...|$|E
50|$|The Musteloidea {{consists}} of the families Ailuridae (red pandas), Mustelidae (mustelids: weasels, otters, martens, and badgers), Procyonidae (procyonids: raccoons, coatis, kinkajous, olingos, olinguitos, ringtails and <b>cacomistles),</b> and Mephitidae (skunks).|$|R
50|$|Procyonidae is a New World {{family of}} the order Carnivora. It {{includes}} the raccoons, coatis, kinkajous, olingos, olinguitos, ringtails and <b>cacomistles.</b> Procyonids inhabit {{a wide range of}} environments and are generally omnivorous.|$|R
5000|$|Procyon is a genus of nocturnal mammals, {{comprising}} {{three species}} {{commonly known as}} raccoons, in the family Procyonidae. The most familiar species, the common raccoon (P. lotor), is often known simply as [...] "the" [...] raccoon, as the two other raccoon species in the genus are native only to the tropics and less well known. Genetic {{studies have shown that}} the closest relatives of raccoons are the ring-tailed cats and <b>cacomistles</b> of genus Bassariscus, from which they diverged about 10 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|The Central American cacomistle's body is 38-47 cm in length, {{which is}} {{attached}} to a tail of approximately the same length, if not longer (typically 39-53 cm long). The male <b>cacomistle</b> is often slightly longer than its female counterpart, however both male and female have approximately the same weight, usually between 1 and 1.5 kg. Their body consists of dark brown and grey fur, which stands as a stark contrast to the black and white striped tail. The tail stripes are the most defined near the animal's posterior end and gradually fade to a solid black {{at the end of the}} tail. The <b>cacomistle</b> is often confused with its close relative the Ring-tailed cat (Scientific name: Bassariscus astutus) because of the similarity of their appearance, but unlike the ring-tail cat the <b>cacomistle</b> does not have retractable claws. The <b>cacomistle</b> can also be identified by its faded tail and the observation of ears that come to a point.|$|E
50|$|The {{animals are}} <b>cacomistle,</b> skunk, opossum, bobcat, coyote, rabbit, hare, {{the birds are}} turkey vulture, falcon, eagle, quail, owl, roadrunner, crow and various kinds of insects and reptils.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cacomistle,</b> Bassariscus sumichrasti, is a nocturnal, {{arboreal}} and omnivorous {{member of}} the carnivoran family Procyonidae. Its preferred habitats are wet, tropical, evergreen woodlands and mountain forests, though seasonally it will venture into drier deciduous forests.|$|E
50|$|Ring-tailed coatis {{have either}} a light brown or black coat, with a lighter under-part and a white-ringed tail in most cases. Coatis {{have a long}} brown tail with rings on it which are {{anywhere}} from starkly defined like a raccoon's to very faint. Like raccoons and unlike ring-tailed cats and <b>cacomistles,</b> the rings go completely around the tail. Coatis often hold the tail erect; it is used as such to keep troops of coatis together in tall vegetation. The tip of the tail can be moved slightly on its own, {{as is the case}} with cats, but it is not prehensile as is that of the kinkajou, another procyonid.|$|R
50|$|About {{twenty percent}} of the borough is {{classified}} as conservation zone with the rest urbanized; however, thirty percent of the population lives in these areas. The area contains a number of threatened species of animal in the Valley of Mexico such as carpenter birds, hummingbirds, <b>cacomistles</b> and several species of lizard. The highest elevations, mostly encompassed by the Desierto de los Leones National Park, are the best conserved. This forest is an important source of oxygenation for the Valley of Mexico. The greatest environmental threat is the continuation of urban sprawl, which threaten forests and other protected areas. Areas which already have high levels of deforestation suffer significant erosion. Although there are official effort in place to control building, illegal settlements are a significant concern, especially those on the edges of the national park.|$|R
50|$|The native {{animals are}} <b>cacomistle,</b> skunk, gopher, Virginia opossum, rabbit, Mexican gray squirrel, turkey, colibri, turkey vulture, {{northern}} mockingbird, rattlesnake, pine snake, xincoyote, red warbler, rufous-crowned sparrow, lesser roadrunner, great horned owl, axolotl, frog, toad, red ant, bee, others.|$|E
50|$|Plesictis was a 75 cm long animal, {{resembling}} a weasel with large eyes, or possibly a <b>cacomistle.</b> Its large eyes and very long tail {{suggest that it}} may have been nocturnal and arboreal. Judging from its teeth, it was an omnivore.|$|E

5000|$|The term <b>cacomistle</b> is {{from the}} Nahuatl {{language}} (tlahcomiztli) and means [...] "half cat" [...] or [...] "half mountain lion"; it is sometimes also {{used to refer to}} the ringtail, Bassariscus astutus, a similar species that inhabits arid northern Mexico and the American Southwest.|$|E
50|$|Common {{birds are}} the eagle, hawk, crow, owl, dove, vulture, bat, swallow, sparrow, lark, quail, pheasant, picocanda and magpie. Wild animals include fox, coyote, badger, armadillo, wild boar, deer, <b>cacomistle,</b> opossum, cougar, skunk, jaguar, panther, rabbit and paca.The area also has lizards, coral snakes, rattlesnakes, {{tarantula}} and scorpion.|$|E
50|$|Animal types {{vary from}} region to region but among mammals {{can be found}} skunks, raccoons, <b>cacomistle,</b> rabbits, armadillos, {{mountain}} lions, and foxes. Numerous bird species {{can be found in}}cluding water fowl such as ducks, storks and seabirds along the coast. Reptiles, amphibians and fish {{can be found in the}} waterways and along the coast.|$|E
50|$|Coatis {{are one of}} five {{groups of}} procyonids {{commonly}} kept as pets {{in various parts of}} North, Central and South America, the others being the raccoons (common and crab-eating), the kinkajou, the ring-tailed cat and <b>cacomistle.</b> However, while both the white-nosed and South America coatis are common in captivity, mountain coatis are extremely rare in captivity.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecosystem}} {{is dominated}} by tropical deciduous forest, with species such as pine and oak in the higher elevations along with kapok, parota, tepeguaje, mango and zapote (Diospyros digyna and Casimiroa edulis). There are also areas of tropical spiny brush. Typical fauna includes species such as <b>cacomistle,</b> skunks, squirrels, coyotes, foxes, Eurasian sparrowhawk, doves and other birds.|$|E
50|$|Bassariscus is a genus in {{the family}} Procyonidae. There are two species in the genus: the ring-tailed cat or {{ringtail}} (B. astutus) and the <b>cacomistle</b> (B. sumichrasti). Genetic {{studies have indicated that}} the closest relatives of Bassariscus are raccoons, from which they diverged about 10 million years ago. The two lineages of Bassariscus are thought to have separated after only another two million years, making it the extant procyonid genus with the earliest diversification.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ringtail}} (Bassariscus astutus) is a mammal of {{the raccoon}} family, native to arid regions of North America. It {{is also known}} as the ringtail cat, ring-tailed cat, miner's cat or bassarisk, and is also sometimes called a [...] "civet cat" [...] (after similar, though unrelated, cat-like omnivores of Asia and Africa). The ringtail is sometimes called a <b>cacomistle,</b> though this term seems to be more often used to refer to Bassariscus sumichrasti.|$|E
5000|$|Mesa Ahumada has {{a varied}} fauna: mammals are <b>cacomistle,</b> skunk, gopher, Virginia opossum, rabbit, Mexican gray squirrel, bat, Mexican hare, birds as turkey, colibri, turkey vulture, {{northern}} mockingbird, red warbler, rufous-crowned sparrow, lesser roadrunner, great horned owl, savannah sparrow, reptils as rattlesnake, pine snake, xincoyote, chirrionera snake, amphibians as axolotl, frog, toad and insects as red ant, bee, firefly, others. The extinct animals in this mountain since last century are coyote, bobcat and gray fox ...|$|E
50|$|Mating {{season is}} the only time cacomistles {{interact}} with each other, and it is only briefly as the female is only receptive to male approaches for one day. After mating, the female <b>cacomistle</b> undergoes a gestation period of approximately two months before giving birth to a single offspring. When the cub is three months old it is weaned, and then taught hunting and survival skills by its mother before going off to develop his or her own territory.|$|E
50|$|San Francisco {{wildlife}} was {{a wooded}} area, but {{the arrival of}} the development and exploitation of forests have led to the fauna of this region to extinction. The few wild species are deer (although there are few examples), rabbit, ferret, opossum, <b>cacomistle,</b> owl, a variety of snakes, lizards and spiders, also pets such as pigs, chickens, turkeys, rabbits, cows, horses, sheep, goats, quail, and ducks. Some of these animals are bred from pre-Hispanic and colonial times.|$|E
50|$|Knoll and Burrow was {{phase two}} of Discoveryland. Knoll and Burrow {{was a very}} {{innovative}} exhibit. The exhibit mimicked a cave on the American prairie. On the outside, visitors could see exhibits for a colony of prairie dogs, a stripped skunk, and a rabbit. Inside were exhibits for a <b>cacomistle,</b> short-tailed leaf-nosed bats, a flying squirrel, blind cave fish, and other insects like scorpions. Inside the cave, guests could look through plexiglass to get up-close views of the outside exhibits.|$|E
50|$|Apaxco {{has many}} native animals. Birds include the owl, eagle, falcon, turkey, colibri, turkey vulture, {{northern}} mockingbird, rufous-crowned sparrow, lesser roadrunner, and roadrunner. The {{reptiles and amphibians}} include rattlesnakes, pine snakes, xincoyotes, axolotls, frogs, and toads. The insects include red ants and bees. Apaxco has two mountain ranges, {{where there is a}} diversity in mammals. To the south is Cerro Mesa Ahumada with <b>cacomistle,</b> skunk, gopher, Virginia opossum, rabbit, and Mexican gray squirrel and to the north the Sierra de Tetzontlalpan is home to bobcat, coyote, and hare.|$|E
50|$|Procyonid fossils once {{believed}} {{to belong to}} the genus Bassariscus, which includes the modern ringtail and <b>cacomistle,</b> have been identified from the Miocene epoch, around 20 million years (Ma) ago. It has been suggested that early procyonids were an offshoot of the canids that adapted to a more omnivorous diet. The recent evolution of procyonids has been centered on Central America (where their diversity is greatest); they invaded the formerly isolated South America as part of the Great American Interchange, beginning about 7.3 Ma ago in the late Miocene, with the appearance there of Cyonasua.|$|E
50|$|Its {{relief is}} {{constituted}} by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and {{the hills of}} Viejo, Cobre and San Ignacio. The hydrography is made by the rivers Dueto and Rito. Its climate is mild, it has rains on summer. It has an annual rainfall of 1,000.0 millimeters and temperatures that range from 2.5 to 38.0º Celsius. The woods are mixed with oak and pine, the fauna is made by <b>cacomistle,</b> skunk, racoon, hare, tlacuache and coyote. The ground provides podzolic ground, its main use is directed to cattle raising and a minor proportion is used for farming and forestation purposes.|$|E
