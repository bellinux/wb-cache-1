The programs were described, assessed, and evaluated {{in terms of their}} backgrounds, mission needs, performance, technical requirements, functionality, and contractual terms. One conclusion was that the <b>contractual</b> <b>statement</b> of work does not measure the performance of the system; rather, it is designed to mandate the requirements for the contractor's performance (e. g., indicators that measure downtime, trouble calls, and software bugs are missing). An overarching recommendation is to integrate all staff information technology functions under one authority, while establishing simple and relevant program performance benchmarks to measure and track actual performance...|$|E
40|$|Recent policy {{introductions}} in Scotland {{have led}} to a <b>contractual</b> <b>statement</b> that teachers’ work should be capable of completion within a 35 hour working week. However research by a team at the University of Glasgow found that teachers worked 45 hours per week on average and found it difficult to reduce their work to fit within a regular 35 hour pattern. This may be because teachers do not conceptualise their work into essential and less essential tasks, something {{that would allow them to}} prioritise which work should be done within a 35 hour week and which set aside to allow effective time management. The article concludes that any policy which is introduced to manage time needs to be based on an understanding of teachers’ sense of professional duty and obligation if it is to change workplace practice...|$|E

50|$|In {{software}} and systems engineering, a use {{case is a}} list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between a role (known in the Unified Modeling Language as an actor) and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human or other external system. In systems engineering use cases are used at a higher level than within software engineering often representing missions or stakeholder goals. The detailed requirements may then be captured in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) or as <b>contractual</b> <b>statements.</b>|$|R

40|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, representations and warranties (<b>contractual</b> <b>statements</b> enforceable through legal action) may have given investors false assurance that mortgage loans were being properly underwritten. This assurance in turn may have contributed to overinvestment in mortgage-backed securities in two ways. First, the assumption that legally enforceable penalties associated with reps and warranties would deter lax underwriting may have led to less monitoring of these contracts than would otherwise have occurred. In turn, the lack of monitoring of actual underwriting practices enabled the spread of lax lending practices. The existence of these reps and warranties and the potential penalties associated with them did not deter lax underwriting. Paradoxically, after the fact, the reps and warranties were enforced and this enforcement contributed to a tightening of credit beyond historic norms. Post-crisis, lenders’ fears over put-back exposure caused them to scale back, particularly on government lending to creditworthy borrowers. The reps and warranties as used in mortgage lending in {{the run-up to}} the crisis were part of the procyclicality of lending, both in the easing and tightening phases of the lending cycle. We suggest reforms to add to the deterrent value of reps and warranties. Particularly we suggest a shift to the countercyclical techniques including dynamic provisioning to increase the in terrorem effect of representations and warranties. Nonetheless such changes would be useless unless they were adopted throughout the lending industry, otherwise, just those entities with risky practices would increase their market share. And next time such entities are more likely to be thinly capitalized, as the lesson of capital exposure to legal risk has been learned, thus further reducing the deterrence effect of reps and warranties, going forward...|$|R
40|$|From an employer's perspective, {{policies}} are a formal method of conveying to employees, {{as well as}} assisting their compliance with, legal obligations in matters including workplace health and safety, grievance handling, sexual harassment, discrimination, trade practices, negligence and contract. 1 Policies also serve to clarify the employee's rights and responsibilities and enunciate accepted standards of conduct. As a separate document to each individual employment contract, policies offer consistency in regulating employment issues because they apply to all employees and provide the flexibility of adding to and varying them. Despite this physical separation between policy and contract, policies can bind the employer and employee {{as part of the}} employment contract. The Supreme Court of New South Wales in Akmeemana v Murray 2 recently considered the circumstances in which {{policies are}} incorporated into an employment contract. Akmeemana is one of few cases where the employer, not the employee, wanted a policy to have contractual force. 3 In finding that the policies had no contractual force, Davies J in Akmeemana addresses four aspects relevant to the existing jurisprudence concerning policy and contract: incorporation of policy by reference; variation of policy; policy as implied term; and non-policy statements. This article commences with a summary of the Akmeemana decision. I then engage in a brief review of the existing jurisprudence. 4 This provides a useful context to the subsequent discussion of the four relevant aspects of the judgment. I conclude with a discussion of how Akmeemana fits within the existing jurisprudence and the lessons, some new and some repeated, it conveys to employers who wish to give <b>contractual</b> force to <b>statements</b> not expressed in the employment contract.
