Philpotts reports that, by the early 19th century, most debtors spent only months in the prison; on 19 April 1826 it held 105 debtors, 99 {{of whom had been}} there for less than six months and the other six for less than a year.|$|E
5|$|Sindhu {{was given}} the ever-full bowl of amrita (elixir of life) as a boon from the Sun-god. The demon was warned that he <b>could</b> <b>drink</b> from the bowl {{as long as it}} was intact. So to protect the bowl, he {{swallowed}} it. Sindhu terrorized the three worlds, so the gods asked Gunesha for help. Gunesha defeated Sindhu's army, cut his general Kamalasura into three pieces and then cut open Sindhu's body, emptying the amrita bowl and thus killing the demon. The creator-god Brahma is described as having built the Morgaon shrine, and marrying Siddhi and Buddhi to Ganesha. At the end of this incarnation, Gunesha returned to his celestial abode, giving his peacock mount to his younger brother Skanda, with whom the peacock mount is generally associated.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Chinese {{holidays}} such as Chinese New Year, Lantern Festival, Cold Food Festival, {{and others}} were universal holidays. In {{the capital city of}} Chang'an there was always lively celebration, especially for the Lantern Festival since the city's nighttime curfew was lifted by the government for three days straight. Between the years 628 and 758, the imperial throne bestowed a total of sixty-nine grand carnivals nationwide, granted by the emperor in the case of special circumstances such as important military victories, abundant harvests after a long drought or famine, the granting of amnesties, the installment of a new crown prince, etc. For special celebration in the Tang era, lavish and gargantuan-sized feasts were sometimes prepared, as the imperial court had staffed agencies to prepare the meals. This included a prepared feast for 1,100 elders of Chang'an in 664, a feast for 3,500 officers of the Divine Strategy Army in 768, and a feast for 1,200 women of the palace and members of the imperial family in the year 826. Drinking wine and alcoholic beverages was heavily ingrained into Chinese culture, as people drank for nearly every social event. A court official in the 8th century allegedly had a serpentine-shaped structure called the 'Ale Grotto' built with 50,000 bricks on the groundfloor that each featured a bowl from which his friends <b>could</b> <b>drink.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ancient Greek mythology {{contains}} several precursors {{to modern}} vampires, though none were considered undead; these included the Empusa, Lamia, and striges (the strix of Ancient Roman mythology). Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. Lamia was the daughter of King Belus and a secret lover of Zeus. However Zeus' wife Hera discovered this infidelity and killed all Lamia's offspring; Lamia swore vengeance and preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood. Like Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on young men. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood. The Romanian vampire breed named Strigoï has no direct relation to the Greek striges, but was derived from the Roman term strix, as {{is the name of the}} Albanian Shtriga and the Slavic Strzyga, though myths about these creatures are more similar to their Slavic equivalents. Greek vampiric entities are seen once again in Homer's epic Odyssey. In Homer's tale, the undead are too insubstantial to be heard by the living and cannot communicate with them without drinking blood first. In the epic, when Odysseus journeyed into Hades, he was made to sacrifice a black ram and a black ewe so that the shades there <b>could</b> <b>drink</b> its blood and communicate.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese brought beer to Colonial Korea in the 1930s in {{the form}} of German lager beers.

Until the mid-1990s when the state rationing system started to crumble, North Koreans would receive one bottle of Korean liquor soju and three bottles of beer for every major public holiday in North Korea. All North Korean beers are bottled in domestic made glass bottles that are of poor quality. During the North Korean famine, beer bottles were used for intravenous therapy (IV) due to the shortage of proper hospital equipment.|$|E

It was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed in no-mans land between the French and German lines. Bozděch helped the injured Duval to an abandoned farm house nearby, wherein the Czech airman discovered a German Shepherd puppy on the floor in the kitchen. While the dog was not initially fond of Duval, it accepted Bozděch. Concerned that the puppy was emaciated, he began to feed it chocolate, but it would not eat it until the rations were partially melted. Bozděch also found an old frying pan, filled it with snow and melted it so that the dog <b>could</b> <b>drink</b> it.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Homer feels bored after Moe {{closed his}} bar to judge {{competitions}} {{and decides to}} spend time with Marge. After his presence at the house becomes too annoying, Marge decides to help him to find a new bar, but when this fails (due to the obnoxious customers), Grampa advises Marge to put Homer in a round of golf, where he will become too distracted to even bother her again. However, before the game begins, Marge meets an elderly man who tells her that he got addictive to golf and barely saw his family again. Marge them realizes that she was going too far and stops Homer from playing, and they both end up having make up sex. In the end, in the reopening of his tavern, Moe explains that he was put on trial and, as punishment for his sociopathic behavior, he is not only banned from California, but is also forbidden from ever judging anything again anywhere in the country (he cannot even express his opinion on how much beer a person <b>could</b> <b>drink</b> before driving). But fortunately for Moe, he is also forbidden from watching the Fox network, something that he acknowledges as being a blessing in disguise, as this leads to an increase of the customers in his bar, including Rupert Murdoch, who asks him to put on The Jay Leno Show.|$|E

500|$|Bottomley's {{trial began}} on 19 May 1922, before Mr Justice Salter. As {{the case was}} beginning, Bottomley secured the {{agreement}} of the prosecuting counsel, Travers Humphreys, to a 15-minute adjournment each day so that he, Bottomley, <b>could</b> <b>drink</b> a pint of champagne, ostensibly for medicinal purposes. He faced 24 fraud charges, involving amounts totalling £170,000. The prosecution produced evidence that he had regularly used Victory Bonds Club funds to finance business ventures, private debts and his expensive lifestyle. Bottomley, who defended himself, claimed that his legitimate expenses {{in connection with the}} club, and repayments made to Victory Bonds Club members, exceeded total receipts by at least £50,000: [...] "I swear I have never made a penny out of it. I swear before God that I have never fraudulently converted a penny of the Club's money". The weight of evidence suggested otherwise; Salter's summing up, described by a biographer as [...] "masterly; lucid and concise, yet complete", went heavily against Bottomley, and the jury required only 28 minutes to convict him on {{all but one of the}} charges. He was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude. Humphreys commented later: [...] "It was not I that floored him, but Drink".|$|E
2500|$|Pulque {{has been}} drunk in {{the lands of}} central Mexico {{and other parts of}} Mesoamerica since before the times of the Aztecs, who {{regarded}} the maguey plant as a divine gift. Although the natives originally had many uses for the maguey plant, the sap became the most sacred and important part of the plant because of its intoxicating qualities. The Aztecs strictly controlled the consumption of the drink, regulating who <b>could</b> <b>drink,</b> when people <b>could</b> <b>drink,</b> how much people <b>could</b> <b>drink,</b> and even how people <b>could</b> <b>drink.</b> Priests and warriors of status were the only ones allowed to drink the [...] "gods' beverage" [...] on any day other than very special occasions. Many times, prisoners about to be sacrificed were given pulque to further please the gods. Other more [...] "ordinary" [...] people who drank pulque more frequently were the elderly, the sick, and pregnant women, because of the belief that the drink had healing powers. People were not allowed to drink to excess, as drunkenness was highly looked down on and only allowed to priests during specific rituals. Because of this, [...] "Aztecs permitted four cups at the most and controlled the size according to age and gender." [...] When drinking pulque during Aztec times, it was also required to pour some of the beverage on the ground, typically at the four sides of the room a person was in.|$|E
