40|$|Noting the {{importance}} of determining whether a bankruptcy court has <b>summary</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> the authors point out that, absent consent, the factors necessary to make this determination are uncertain. This paper examines the controversy as to whether possession of disputed property by the debtor is the only sufficient basis to give <b>summary</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> or whether ownership, apart from possession, will also suffice. The authors examine the commentators-Collier and Remington-as well as the case law and pending legislation on the issue.

50|$|Four {{same-sex}} couples {{represented by the}} ACLU and local attorneys filed a lawsuit {{in federal court in}} Great Falls on May 21, 2014, challenging the Montana Constitutions definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman and related statutes. The plaintiffs in the suit, Rolando v. Fox, include three couples (Shauna and Nicole Goubeaux, Ben Milano and Chase Weinhandl, Sue Hawthorne and Adel Johnson) who married in Hawaii, Iowa, and Washington state. A fourth couple, Angela and Tonya Rolando, were denied a marriage license by the Cascade County Clerk of Court. Governor Steve Bullock expressed support for the plaintiffs. Attorney General Tim Fox defended the state. On October 15, citing the recent decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Latta v. Otter, which ended bans on same-sex marriage in Idaho and Nevada, the plaintiffs asked the <b>court</b> <b>for</b> <b>summary</b> judgment. Their brief compared the texts of Montanas ban with those of Idaho and Nevada and used the Latta decision to counter the states arguments. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Morris ruled for the plaintiffs on November 19, 2014, and his injunction against the states enforcement of its ban on same-sex marriage took effect immediately. Attorney General Fox announced plans to appeal the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. At the request of all parties, the Ninth Circuit suspended proceedings in the states appeal on February 9, 2015, pending action by the Supreme Court in DeBoer v. Snyder.|$|R

40|$|It {{is open to}} the United States Congress {{under its}} {{constitutional}} authority to create separate bankruptcy courts. Instead of doing so, Congress has directed United States district courts to serve as bankruptcy courts on a part-time basis. It also is within the congressional prerogative to confer upon the chosen bankruptcy courts exclusive jurisdiction over all controversies arising under the Bankruptcy Act. But that jurisdiction has been fractionated, with some reserved to bankruptcy courts and the balance distributed to two kinds of nonbankruptcy courts, namely United States district courts sitting as ordinary federal courts and state courts. Jurisdiction may be classified as either plenary or <b>summary.</b> <b>Summary</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> is the power to adjudicate controversies in <b>summary</b> proceedings. Plenary <b>jurisdiction</b> is comparable judicial power to adjudicate in plenary proceedings—that is, an ordinary suit at law or in equity in which the trustee or receiver in bankruptcy happens to be a party. Bankruptcy courts exercise plenary jurisdiction in a few instances, but practically all of their cases involve <b>summary</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Nonbankruptcy courts exercise plenary jurisdiction.
