40|$|Study Objective: Community-based {{models for}} injury {{prevention}} {{have become an}} accepted {{part of the overall}} injury control strategy. This systematic review of the scientific literature examines the evidence for their effectiveness in reducing injury due to inadequate car seat restraint use in children 0 - 16 years of age. Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature was performed using the following study selection criteria: community-based intervention study: target population was children aged 0 - 16 years of age; outcome measure was either injury rates due to motor vehicle crashes or observed changes in child restraint use; and use of community control or historical control in the study design. Quality assessment and data abstraction was guided by a standardized procedure and performed independently by two authors. Data synthesis was in tabular and text form with meta-analysis not being possible due to the discrepancy in methods and measures between the studies. Results: This review found eight studies, that met all the inclusion criteria. In the studies that measured injury outcomes, significant reductions in risk of motor vehicle occupant injury (33 - 55 %) were reported in the study communities. For those studies reporting observed car seat restraint use the community-based programs were successful in increasing toddler restraint use in 1 - 5 year aged children by up to 11 %; <b>child</b> <b>booster</b> <b>seat</b> use in 4 - 8 year aged children by up to 13 %; rear restraint use in children aged 0 - 15 years by 8 %; a 50 % increase in restraint use in pre-school aged children in a high-risk community; and a 44 % increase in children aged 5 - 11 years. Conclusion: While this review highlights that there is some evidence to support the effectiveness of community-based programs to promote car restraint use and/or motor vehicle occupant injury, limitations in the evaluation methodologies of the studies requires the results to be interpreted with caution. There is clearly a need for further high quality program evaluation research to develop an evidence base. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain a more {{detailed}} understanding of the restraint usage rates, ‘appropriateness’ of restraint use, and the factors that influence appropriate restraint use for <b>children</b> in the <b>booster</b> <b>seat</b> age group. Six hundred and ninety nine parents from the States of New South Wales and Victoria completed a questionnaire regarding restraint use by their children aged 4 to 11 years. The findings revealed that only 24 percent of children aged between 4 and 11 years old were travelling in a <b>booster</b> <b>seat,</b> while the remaining 76 percent were travelling in a seat belt. <b>Children</b> travelling in <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> were significantly younger (5. 8 years vs. 8. 2 years), lighter in weight (21. 9 kg vs. 30. 3 kg) and shorter in height (115 cm vs. 131 cm) compared with children travelling in a seat belt. Children travelling in a <b>booster</b> <b>seat</b> were also significantly more likely to be sitting in the front passenger position (for all vehicle types) (38 %) compared to children travelling in a seat belt (28 %). Appropriateness of restraint use was computed using height criteria of 100 - 140 cm for <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> and greater than 140 cm for seat belts. Based on the height measurements provided by parents, <b>children</b> travelling in <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> were found to be significantly more likely to be appropriately restrained (93 %) compared to children travelling in a seat belt (25 %). The likelihood of being appropriately restrained in a <b>booster</b> <b>seat</b> was greater for female children compared with males and greater amongst those who had a sibling in a seat belt compared with those who did not. Appropriate booster use was also influenced by parents’ knowledge about size thresholds for transition to seat belts and there was a greater likelihood of appropriate use of boosters with increasing age and weight of the child. Amongst those children using a seat belt, the mean age for their transition into a seat belt was 5. 6 years. The most important reason cited by parents for moving a child into a seat belt was that the child was too big for their forward facing child restraint/booster seat (69 %). Children who were appropriately restrained in a seat belt were more likely to be in a smaller vehicle than a larger vehicle and not have another sibling in a <b>booster</b> <b>seat</b> compared to those who did have a sibling in a <b>booster</b> <b>seat.</b> Additionally, the likelihood of appropriate seat belt use increased with greater weekly distance travelled and increased age and weight of the child.

This study was undertaken to initiate a process to evaluate the performance of multiple high back <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> by conducting a series of sled tests. These 56 kph sled tests were done using the Hybrid III 6 -year-old child dummy in 4 different high back <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> and their injury measures were compared. Results of these tests have been summarized in this paper and provide an evidenence for a differential performance among the various designs of high back <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> compounded with the established lack of biofidelity of the Hybrid III 6 -year-old dummy. Injury tolerances exceeded for the 6 year-old dummy in two of the high back <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> for the Head Injury Criteria, in three of the seats for chest G’s and in all the four seats for the Neck Injury Criteria. In two of the seats with similar design, the kinematics of the head was unusual, mainly due to the extreme hyper-flexing of the neck.

40|$|Objective Misuse {{of child}} {{restraint}} systems is a widespread and long-standing problem impacting risk of injury and death in car crashes. Discomfort has been suggested as a causative factor for misuse, particularly in errors introduced by children while they use the restraints. However, the relationship between comfort and errors in use has never been studied. In this study we examine the reliability and sensitivity of a newly developed observational method for assessing comfort in children in vehicles. We then use this method {{to examine the relationship}} between comfort and errors in use of <b>booster</b> <b>seats.</b> Methods A novel method was developed for assessing comfort by counting fidgeting and postural adjustment behaviors to derive a Discomfort Avoidance Behavior (DAB) score. The sensitivity of the DAB score was examined by observing children in four different seating conditions designed as “comfortable” and “uncomfortable” (Part 1). Paired-samples t-tests were used to compare differences in DAB between seating conditions. The reliability of the DAB score was assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between DAB scores recorded by different researchers. The association between comfort and correctness of use was examined by observing <b>children</b> using <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> (Part 2). The association between DAB score and number of usage errors was tested using linear regression analysis. Participants were children ages 4 – 8 years.

The objective {{of this study was to}} examine cases of abdominal injuries in <b>booster</b> <b>seated</b> <b>children</b> through parametric modeling to gain a thorough understanding of the injury causation scenarios. The Partners for Child Passenger Safety and CIREN in-depth crash investigation databases were queried to identify <b>children</b> in belt-positioning <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> with abdominal injuries. The injury causation scenarios for these injuries were delineated using the CIREN Biotab method. The cases were modeled, using MADYMO with variations in key parameters, to determine the ranges of loads and loading rates for the abdomen and thorax. A parametric study was completed examining the influence of pretensioners and load limiters on the injury metrics obtained. Query of the two databases revealed three cases involving abdominal injuries to <b>booster</b> <b>seated</b> <b>children.</b> Children in two of the cases sustained a thoracic injury (AIS 3 /AIS 4) in addition to their abdominal injuries (AIS 2) and review of these cases pointed to the role of shoulder belt loading in the injury causation.

Seat belts fit properly when the lap belt lays across the upper highs (not the stomach) and the shoulder belt lays across the chest (not the neck). Keep children ages 12 and under in the back seat. Never place a rear-facing car seat in front of an active air bag...|$|R
50|$|<b>Booster</b> <b>seats</b> are {{recommended}} for children {{until they are}} big enough to properly use a seat belt. Seat belts are engineered for adults, and are thus too big for small children. In the United States, for {{children under the age}} of 4 and/or under 40 lb, a seat with a 5-point harness is suggested instead of a <b>booster</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R
40|$|A 7 -year-old boy {{travelling}} in {{the rear}} seat of a sedan car was wearing a lap-shoulder seat belt and sitting on a <b>booster</b> <b>seat.</b> Following a collision the boy 'submarined' under the seat belt sustaining trauma to the anterior aspect of his neck, cardiac arrest and subsequent death from hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. This case demonstrates a potential problem with unsecured older-style <b>booster</b> <b>seats.</b> Movement of a seat in a collision may cause a child to slip under a seat belt and sustain significant neck injuries. Seatbelts for children must be correctly fitted, <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> or capsules must be securely fastened and manufacturer's recommendations for size and weight limits should be followed. Unfortunately older <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> may not have attached instructions for installation and use, may not fit later model vehicles, may not conform to current safety recommendations and may have worn webbing. For these reasons their use should be discouraged...|$|R
40|$|<b>Booster</b> <b>seat</b> {{use among}} 4 - to 7 -year-old {{children}} stood at 37 percent in 2007, statistically unchanged from the prior year’s rate of 41 percent. This result {{is from the}} National Survey of the Use of <b>Booster</b> <b>Seats</b> (NSUBS), the only probability-based nationwide child restraint survey that observes restraint use and obtains age by interview. The NSUBS is conducted by the National Center for Statistics and Analysis of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The appropriate restraint system for children 4 to 7 is either a front-facing safety <b>seat</b> or a <b>booster</b> <b>seat,</b> depending on the child’s height and weight. However, the NSUBS found that in 2007, 37 percent of children {{in this age group}} were using <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> (whether high-backed or backless), 13 percent were restrained in child safety seats, 35 percent were in seat belts, and 15 percent were unrestrained. These results indicat...|$|R

Some <b>booster</b> <b>seats</b> can be used for children up to 60 inches and 120 pounds.|$|R

To the editors: Ehiri et al. 1 {{reviewed}} interventions {{aimed at}} increasing {{the use of}} children’s <b>booster</b> <b>seats.</b> They found 1350 reports on child motor vehicle occupant protection, of which 18 dealt specifically with <b>booster</b> <b>seat</b> interventions; they excluded 13 studies due to methodologic weaknesses (largely, {{the lack of a}} control group) and discussed the remaining five. In addition to substantive discussion, they made the following methodologic points: 1. Of the five, two did not use randomized assignment. 2. Of the remaining three, one used self-report, not observation, of <b>booster</b> <b>seat</b> use. 3. Of the remaining two, one had a follow-up period of only 2 weeks. 4. The remaining study had a 34 % dropout rate of children. Further, control as well as treatment groups were exposed to publicity regarding <b>booster</b> <b>seat</b> legislation. Therefore, conclusions could be generalized only to other situations where there was such publicity. TP Hutchinson[URL]...|$|R
