5|$|Before {{the release}} of Pixies' debut mini-album <b>Come</b> <b>On</b> Pilgrim in October 1987, Ivo Watts-Russell, head of 4AD, {{suggested}} they return to the studio to record a full-length album. The original plan was to record new material at Fort Apache Studios, where the band had produced The Purple Tape and <b>Come</b> <b>On</b> Pilgrim. However, due to differences between the band's manager Ken Goes and The Purple Tape producer Gary Smith, Pixies ended up {{looking for a new}} producer and recording studio. On the advice of a 4AD colleague, Watts-Russell looked to hire Steve Albini, ex-frontman of Big Black, as the record's engineer and producer. Having sent a pre-release tape of <b>Come</b> <b>On</b> Pilgrim to Albini, Pixies' manager, Ken Goes, invited him to a Boston dinner party at drummer David Lovering's house a few weeks after <b>Come</b> <b>On</b> Pilgrims release.|$|E

Carrick buried his spot-kick, as did Juliano Belletti with his first touch of the game, having <b>come</b> <b>on</b> for Makélélé {{at the end of}} extra time. The first miss of the shoot-out came from Ronaldo, who characteristically stuttered in his run-up in an attempt to put Čech off, but the goalkeeper dived to his right to save.|$|E
5|$|By 1968 the Americans {{were well}} aware of the scope and scale of the Cambodian {{logistical}} effort, but still remained reluctant to overtly violate Cambodia's neutrality since the U.S. still hoped to persuade Sihanouk to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> board against the communists. It was also conscious that any overt action might escalate the conflict into the international arena, possibly directly involving the Soviets and/or Chinese.|$|E

Having missed games due to hamstring, foot, and back problems, he was deemed fit enough to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> as a late substitute against PSV in a Champions League match, but began limping shortly after coming on.

5|$|The {{original}} Chinese {{plan called}} for the 58th Division to attack Hagaru-ri {{on the night of}} 27 November, but the division became lost in the countryside due to the outdated Japanese maps it used. It was not until the dawn of 28 November that the 58th Division arrived at Hagaru-ri.
