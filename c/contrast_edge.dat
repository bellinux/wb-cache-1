40|$|Accurate {{detection}} of vessel boundaries {{is particularly important}} for a precise extraction of vasculatures in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). In this paper, we propose the use of weighted local variance (WLV) -based edge detection scheme for vessel boundary detection in MRA. The proposed method is robust against changes of intensity <b>contrast</b> of <b>edges</b> and capable of giving high detection responses on low <b>contrast</b> <b>edges.</b> These robustness and capabilities are essential for detecting the boundaries of vessels in low contrast regions of images, which can contain intensity inhomogeneity, such as bias field, interferences induced from other tissues, or fluctuation of the speed related vessel intensity. The performance of the WLV-based edge detection scheme is studied and shown {{to be able to}} return strong and consistent detection responses on low <b>contrast</b> <b>edges</b> in the experiments. The proposed edge detection scheme can be embedded naturally in the active contour models for vascular segmentation. The WLV-based vascular segmentation method is tested using MRA image volumes.

40|$|The {{transition}} to symbolic information from images involves {{in general the}} loss or misclassification of information. One {{way to deal with}} this missing or wrong information is to get feedback from concrete hypotheses derived at a symbolic level to the sub-symbolic (signal) stage to amplify weak information or correct misclassifications. This paper proposes such a feedback mechanism between the symbolic level and the signal level, which we call signal symbol loop. We apply this framework for the detection of low <b>contrast</b> <b>edges</b> making use of predictions based on Rigid Body Motion. Once the Rigid Body Motion is known, the location and the properties of edges at a later frame can be predicted. We use these predictions as feedback to the signal level at a later frame to improve the detection of low <b>contrast</b> <b>edges.</b> We demonstrate our mechanism on a real example, and evaluate the results using an artificial scene, where the ground truth data is available...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{diagnostic}} radiography {{is limited}} by the similarity between x-ray absorption coefficients of normal tissue and carcinoma, which results in poor inherent subject contrast. Differences in x-ray refractive indices are much larger, so phase imaging has the potential for higher contrast. Unfortunately, the spatial coherence necessary for simple in-line phase contrast requires small sources at large distances, and hence excessive exposure times. Other schemes such as grating techniques require multiple images and complex alignment. In this work, polycapillary optics were employed to increase the intensity of the x-ray beam for simple propagation in-line imaging.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{representation and}} logic for labeling <b>contrast</b> <b>edges</b> and ridges in visual scenes {{in terms of}} both surface occlusion (border ownership) and thinline objects. In natural scenes, thinline objects include sticks and wires, while in human graphical communication thinlines include connectors, dividers, and other abstract devices. Our analysis is directed at both natural and graphical domains. The basic problem is to formulate the logic of the interactions among local image events, specifically <b>contrast</b> <b>edges,</b> ridges, junctions, and alignment relations, such as to encode the natural constraints among these events in visual scenes. In a sparse heterogeneous Markov Random Field framework, we define a set of interpretation nodes and energy/potential functions among them. The minimum energy configuration found by Loopy Belief Propagation is shown to correspond to preferred human interpretation across a wide range of prototypical examples including important illusory contour figures such as the Kanizsa Triangle, as well as more difficult examples. In practical terms, the approach delivers correct interpretations of inherently ambiguous hand-drawn box-and-connector diagrams at low computational cost. ...|$|R

Most edge operators, such as Canny operator, detect edge centers and use gradient magnitude to represent edge strength. In this paper, for each edge, we detect three crucial elements, <b>edge</b> center, <b>edge</b> <b>contrast,</b> and <b>edge</b> span. Once the <b>edge</b> <b>contrast</b> and the <b>edge</b> span have been identified, they can be adjusted for different purposes, like contrast enhancement and sharpness enhancement.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Composited wide {{field of}} view {{satellite}} data are used for many applications and increasingly for studies of global change. Although several compositing schemes have been suggested, all as-sume perfect geometric registration, which is not operationally fea-sible. In this study, models of the satellite imaging, geometric reg-istration, and compositing processes are used to investigate the im-pact of misregistration upon the position of high <b>contrast</b> <b>edges</b> found in composited satellite data. Simulations are performed {{with respect to the}} compositing of advanced very high resolution ra-diometer (AVHRR) and moderate resolution imaging spectrora-diometer (MODIS) data. <b>Contrast</b> <b>edges</b> are found to be system-atically shifted in maximum and minimum value composites. The degree of shifting increases with the number of orbits that are com-posited, the degree of misregistration and the view zenith angle. The implications of these findings upon the utility of composited satellite data for change detection are discussed. The shifts may systematically bias estimates of location and area when composited data are used. They may also cause small and/or fragmented fea-tures, which are evident in individual orbits to disappear in com-posited data, precluding the ability to map such features or to de-tect their occurrence under a change detection scheme.

40|$|It is a {{principal}} open question whether noninvasive imaging methods in humans can decode information encoded at a spatial scale as fine as the basic functional unit of cortex: cortical columns.

An essential consequence of our results is that information encoded in the human brain {{at the level of}} cortical columns should in general be accessible by multivariate analysis of electrophysiological signals.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Satellite {{remote sensing}} image is {{degraded}} by many factors such as sensor imperfections, atmospheric turbulence, electric circuit noise and satellite vibration. In this paper, a new approach for digital restoration of blurred and noisy satellite image based on markov random fields (MRF) model is presented. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation framework is exploited in MRF modeling for image restoration. Under the posteriori distribution, the restoration result is derived by finding the global optimized estimation with the stimulated annealing (SA) optimization mechanism. In the experiments, the proposed method can improve both resolvable detail and contrast of blurred and noisy satellite image. The general evaluation criteria including spatial frequency, <b>contrast,</b> <b>edge</b> energy and average gradient are also adopted to quantitatively demonstrate great improvement of restoration performance by our method {{in comparison with the}} wiener filtering method. 1...|$|E
40|$|Motion-blur {{is still}} an {{important}} issue on liquid crystal displays (LCD). In the last years, efforts {{have been done in}} the characterization and the measurement of this artifact. These methods permit to picture the blurred profile of a moving edge, according to the scrolling speed and to the gray-to-gray transition considered. However, other aspects should be taken in account {{in order to understand the}} way LCD motion-blur is perceived. In the last years, a couple of works have adressed the problem of LCD motion-blur perception, but only few speeds and transitions have been tested. In this paper, we have explored motion-blur perception over 20 gray-to-gray transitions and several scrolling speeds. Moreover, we have used three different displays, to explore the influence of the luminance range as well as the blur shape on the motion-blur perception. A blur matching experiment has been set up to obtain the relation between objective measurements and perception. In this experiment, observers must adjust a stationary test blur (simulated from measurements) until it matches their perception of the blur occuring on a moving edge. Result shows that the adjusted perceived blur is always lower than the objective measured blur. This effect is greater for low <b>contrast</b> <b>edges</b> than for high <b>contrast</b> <b>edges.</b> This could be related to the motion sharpening phenomenon. 1...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2014 Fire is {{a dynamic}} {{ecosystem}} process in mixed-conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada, however there is limited scientific information addressing wildlife habitat use in burned landscapes. Recent studies suggest stand-replacing wildfires may be {{a major source of}} habitat loss for spotted owls (Strix occidentalis). While fire promotes heterogeneous forest patches, high severity fire may create large canopy gaps that can fragment closed-canopy habitat preferred by spotted owls. Large areas of high severity fire may eliminate protective cover or perch sites for spotted owls, while unburned or low to moderate severity fire containing intact forest canopy may provide protective cover or high prey availability. I used radio telemetry to determine whether foraging California spotted owls in Yosemite National Park showed selection for particular types of fire severity. My results suggest that spotted owls exhibited habitat selection for lower fire severities, edge sites, and locations near the roost within their home range. Although owls selected high <b>contrast</b> <b>edges</b> with greater relative probabilities than low <b>contrast</b> <b>edges,</b> I did not detect a statistical difference in these edge types. Protecting the remaining forests from stand-replacing fires via mechanical thinning or prescribed fire is a priority for management agencies, and my results suggest that fires of low to moderate severity can create habitat conditions suitable for California spotted owls...|$|R
40|$|Regionally {{intensive}} {{human activities}} related to resource extraction (i. e., harvesting, oil and gas extraction) are increasing the occurrence of edges found in some forested landscapes. Edges between different land cover types represent important transition zones for abiotic and biotic processes. However, boundary detection methods often identify edges solely in areas of high contrast, such as transitions between forest and non-forest areas, and are insensitive to the relative contrast and orientation of different transitions. <b>Edge</b> <b>contrast</b> and orientation can determine the magnitude and even the occurrence of ecological edge effects and should be measured to provide information on landscape condition and habitat potential. Wombling {{was applied to the}} wetness component of a tasselled cap transformation (TCT) of a Landsat scene acquired over a portion of the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada. By incorporating wombled <b>edge</b> <b>contrast</b> and orientation, and edge class transition type obtained from a land cover dataset, the nature of all transitions between land cover classes within the image was characterized and quantified. The consistency between edges identified by wombling and other common methods of edge delineation (such as spatial clustering) and methods of edge quantification (such as landscape pattern indices, or LPIs) was also assessed. Land cover transitions showed a broad range of <b>edge</b> <b>contrast.</b> Comparisons of <b>edge</b> <b>contrast</b> and the LPI edge density showed a positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 33); however, the strength of this relationship varied with the dominant land cover type (e. g., r 2 = 0. 016 for broadleaf open forest to r 2 = 0. 48 for dense coniferous forest). Stratifying <b>edge</b> <b>contrast</b> to higher values (i. e., > 1 standard deviation) increased agreement with edge density, indicating that the LPI is preferentially relating high <b>contrast</b> <b>edges.</b> This study demonstrates how unique edge characteristics may be generated from a remotely sensed continuous variable (TCT wetness).
