5|$|In {{the early}} Paleogene period between 63 and 52 Ma, the last {{volcanic}} {{rocks in the}} British Isles were formed. As North America and Greenland separated from Europe, the Atlantic Ocean slowly formed. This led to a chain of volcanic sites west of mainland Scotland including on Skye, the Small Isles and St. Kilda, in the Firth of Clyde on Arran and Ailsa Craig and at Ardnamurchan. Sea levels began to fall, {{and for the first}} time the general outline of the modern British Isles was revealed. At the beginning of this period the climate was sub-tropical and erosion was caused by <b>chemical</b> <b>weathering,</b> creating characteristic features of the Scottish landscape such as the topographical basin of the Howe of Alford near Aberdeen. The vegetation of the period is known from Paleocene sedimentary deposits on Isle of Mull. The rich flora here included temperate-climate tree species such as plane, hazel, oak, Cercidiphyllum, Metasequoia and ginkgo.|$|E
5|$|Such large {{temperature}} variations have {{a destructive}} {{effect on the}} exposed rocky surfaces. The repeated fluctuations put a strain on exposed rock and the flanks of mountains crack and shatter. Fragmented strata slide down into the valleys where they continue to break into pieces due to the relentless sun by day and chill by night. Successive strata are exposed to further weathering. The relief of the internal pressure that has built up in rocks that have been underground for aeons can cause them to shatter. Exfoliation also occurs when the outer surfaces of rocks split off in flat flakes. This {{is believed to be}} caused by the stresses put on the rock by repeated expansions and contractions which induces fracturing parallel to the original surface. <b>Chemical</b> <b>weathering</b> processes probably play a more important role in deserts than was previously thought. The necessary moisture may be present in the form of dew or mist. Ground water may be drawn to the surface by evaporation and the formation of salt crystals may dislodge rock particles as sand or disintegrate rocks by exfoliation. Shallow caves are sometimes formed at the base of cliffs by this means.|$|E

40|$|Environmental data {{analysis}} and information provision are considered {{of great importance}} for people, since environmental conditions are strongly related to health issues and directly affect a variety of everyday activities. Nowadays, there are several free web-based services that provide environmental information in several formats with map images being {{the most commonly used}} to present air quality and pollen forecasts.

25|$|Clay {{minerals}} typically form {{over long}} periods of time as a result of the gradual <b>chemical</b> <b>weathering</b> of rocks, usually silicate-bearing, by low concentrations of carbonic acid and other diluted solvents. These solvents, usually acidic, migrate through the weathering rock after leaching through upper weathered layers. In addition to the weathering process, some clay minerals are formed through hydrothermal activity. There are two types of clay deposits: primary and secondary. Primary clays form as residual deposits in soil and remain at the site of formation. Secondary clays are clays that have been transported from their original location by water erosion and deposited in a new sedimentary deposit. Clay deposits are typically associated with very low energy depositional environments such as large lakes and marine basins.|$|E
25|$|Daily extreme {{temperature}} variations create fractures by repeated expansion and contraction {{of the rock}} in a process called thermal stress weathering. The thermal stresses can cause deep cracks that split the rock into separate pieces in an erosional process called thermal exfoliation. Precipitation causes dissolution of the fine crystalline grains that bind the larger particles together, which is known as <b>chemical</b> <b>weathering.</b> Freezing water expands in fractures making them wider and deeper in a process called frost weathering. Gravity exerts a constant downward force that creates new fractures and separates the formations along existing fractures in a process called stress relief exfoliation. High speed winds remove any loose grains from the formations and wind-borne particulates sandblast the surfaces making them smoother.|$|E
25|$|Tropical {{weathering}} (laterization) is {{a prolonged}} process of <b>chemical</b> <b>weathering</b> which produces {{a wide variety}} in the thickness, grade, chemistry and ore mineralogy of the resulting soils. The initial products of weathering are essentially kaolinized rocks called saprolites. A period of active laterization extended from about the mid-Tertiary to the mid-Quaternary periods (35 to 1.5 million years ago). Statistical analyses show that the transition in the mean and variance levels of 18O {{during the middle of}} the Pleistocene was abrupt. It seems this abrupt change was global and mainly represents an increase in ice mass; at about the same time an abrupt decrease in sea surface temperatures occurred; these two changes indicate a sudden global cooling. The rate of laterization would have decreased with the abrupt cooling of the earth. Weathering in tropical climates continues to this day, at a reduced rate.|$|E
