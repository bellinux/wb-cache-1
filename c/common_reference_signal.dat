The newly defined norm is related to signal average power making possible to account for most <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signals</b> e. g. step, periodic. It is formally shown that, whatever the reference shape and amplitude, the achievable tracking quality is determined by a well defined reference tracking mismatch error.

30|$|Owing to the {{difficulty}} to set the appropriate bias value for each UE, many articles mainly discuss applying ICIC[5 – 8]. ICIC is realized by dividing the radio resource: between two categories of MBS and PBS, ICIC is usually realized by stopping MBS’s transmission on some radio resources. ICIC is applied by separating frequency band in the frequency-domain approach instead of separating time slot in the time-domain approach. In the time-domain approach, almost blank subframe (ABS) [5] in which MBSs stop sending data and PBSs send to pico UEs (PUEs), particularly ER UEs, is mainly applied. However, even if ABS is used, reference signals are still transmitted by MBS, which causes interference [7]. To eliminate this interference, proposals in the literature include using lightly loaded controlling channel transmission subframe (LLCS) [7] or interference cancelation of <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> (CRS-IC) [8]. In the frequency-domain approach, furthermore, the restricted transmit power of MBS on the allocated frequency to PBS is also discussed in [9].|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{connecting}} widely distributed antennas into a coherent array, {{it is necessary to}} synchronize the timing of signals at the various locations. This can be accomplished by distributing a <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> from a central source, usually over optical fiber. A high-frequency (RF or microwave) tone is a good choice for the reference. One difficulty is that the effective length of the optical fiber changes with temperature and mechanical stress, leading to phase instability in the received tone. This innovation provides a new way to stabilize the phase of the received tone, in spite of variations in the electrical length of the fiber. Stabilization is accomplished by two-way transmission in which part of the received signal is returned to the transmitting end over an identical fiber. The returned signal is detected and used to close an electrical servo loop whose effect is to keep constant the phase of the tone at the receiving end...|$|E

Cell {{association}} is a critical aspect of cellular network operation wherein mobile terminals (MTs) connect to optimal base stations before commencing data transmission and reception. This paper investigates a novel physical layer security problem wherein malicious base stations (MBSs) seek to subvert the cell association process by spoofing the <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signals</b> of legitimate base stations (LBSs). Since these signals are used by MTs to measure signal strength, the MBSs thus attempt to {{increase the likelihood of}} MT radio link failure (RLF). A stochastic geometry approach using a Poisson point process (PPP) to model the random locations of LBSs and MBSs is used to analyze the impact of this attack. We analytically derive the conditional probability of the RLF given a suboptimal association triggered by MBSs and verify the theoretical results using simulations.

40|$|One of the {{currently}} explored strategies for interference avoidance and improving Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for mobile communication systems is Coordinated MultiPoint (CoMP) transmission. The general {{idea of the}} strategy is to let two or more base stations serve the same user. Due to delay factors, the channels from each serving base station needs to be predicted to obtain an adaptive CoMP system. In this thesis, a user interface is created {{to act as an}} experimental platform for a set of measured downlink channel data. The user interface supports editing of the channel data, model estimation, Kalman filtering and prediction and evaluation of the channel statistics. The user interface and the measured channel downlink data is then used to examine how well we can predict the weakest channel in a CoMP setup with three base stations. The predictions are carried out using an m-step Kalman predictor which uses an AR 4 model, estimated from previous channel data. For the investigation, the user moves at pedestrian speed and the signals from the three different base stations use orthogonal <b>Common</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Signals</b> (CRS). A comparison of different CRS patterns is also included in the investigation. It is concluded that 5 ms predictions of the weakest channel achieves a normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of - 8 dB or lower provided that the weakest signal has an SNR of at least 5 dB and is no more than 15 dB lower than the combined received signal. Additionally, it is found that predictions are more accurate for CRS patterns spread over time than over subcarriers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} two transmitter architectures for {{wireless power}} transmission (WPT) applications. These architectures aim at transmitting high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) multi-sine signals, which have demonstrated {{to improve the}} RF-dc conversion efficiency of rectifier circuits, {{such as the ones}} in the receiving end of a WPT system. In order to overcome the challenges associated to the amplification of high PAPR signals, the proposed schemes make use of the spatial power combining concept, in which the individual signal components are amplified, radiated, and then combined in free space. In order to achieve the high PAPR signals, proper synchronization of the individual tones is required. Two architectures are proposed. The first one is based on the transmission of single-tone signals that are externally locked to a <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> that establishes the necessary phase reference. The second architecture is based on a mode-locked oscillator scheme that requires no external reference signal. Instead, this scheme takes advantage of the synchronization phenomena in oscillator circuits to establish the phase reference.

This paper describes a new method to measure the Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of a radio signal for terrestrial propagation studies. The new technique allows the phase of radio signals received by incoherent detectors arranged in an array formation to be obtained. This measurement, along with the amplitude readings at each element of the array can then be processed to find the AoA of signals on the array. The proposed technique is novel in that frequency drift and offsets, arising because the different receivers are incoherent, are compensated for {{by way of a}} <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> injected into the front of the array. The phase of the incoming signals are obtained by processing the down-converted and digitized waveforms. A novel approach based on an adaptive, discrete-time quadrature delay estimator (QDE) algorithm is used for this purpose. This algorithm is insensitive to variations in the amplitudes of the input signals, and does not require an accurate prior estimate of the frequency of the input sinusoids. This approach is shown to be an accurate, low cost alternative to conventional vector measurement techniques when used with large antenna arrays and is therefore well suited to fixed link, angle-of-arrival measurements...|$|E

40|$|Modern cold-atom-based {{frequency}} standards have already archived {{the uncertainty of}} 10 − 15 at a few days. Moreover coldatom- based optical clocks {{have the potential to}} realize the uncertainty of from 10 − 16 to 10 − 17 level after a few hours. On the other hand, time transfer precision of two-way satellite time and frequency transfer and GPS carrier phase experiments have reached the 10 − 10 @ 1 sec (10 − 15 @ 1 day) level. In order to compare such modern standards by these time transfer techniques, it is necessary to average over long periods. Since these techniques are not sufficient to compare next standards improvements of high precision time transfer techniques are strongly desired. Space geodetic techniques like VLBI, SLR and GPS are based on precise time measurement using very stable <b>reference</b> <b>signals.</b> VLBI measures the arrival time delays between multiple stations utilizing radio signals from distant celestial radio sources like quasars and pulsars. In the usual geodetic VLBI analysis, clock offsets and their rates of change at each station are estimated with respect to a selected reference station. The averaged formal error (1 sigma) of the clock offsets is typically about 20 picoseconds when analyzing geodetic VLBI experiments which are regularly conducted by the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS). This precision is nearly one order better than other techniques like GPS or two-way satellite time transfer. In this study we compare time transfer precision between VLBI and GPS carrier phase using the Kashima-Koganei baseline in order to confirm the potential of VLBI time and frequency transfer. VLBI experiments were performed four times (two 24 hour sessions, one 3 days session and one 7 days session) and GPS observations were carried out at the same time sharing <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signals.</b> The averaged formal error (1 sigma) of the hourly estimated clock offsets as obtained from VLBI analysis was 30 picoseconds. The difference between VLBI and GPS was about +/- 500 picoseconds what is considered to be caused by the uncertainty of the GPS time transfer. The results show that VLBI time transfer is more stable than GPS time transfer on the same baseline. We also compare time transfer precision using the Onsala-Wettsell baseline. We used R 1 experiments (R 1270, R 1271, R 1273 and R 1274 sessions) conducted by IVS and the International GNSS Service (IGS) stations (ONSA and WTZR) data. The results show more clearly that VLBI time transfer is more stable than GPS time transfer on the same baseline and same period. In general, the VLBI time transfer stability follows 1 /tau very close. Based on these findings, we will discuss about the possible improvements of time and frequency transfer using the compact VLBI system.

This is to experimentally verify that adaptation of the heating pattern with respect to tumour size can be realised by varying the operating frequency of the antennas and potentially by using Ultra-wideband (UWB) pulse sequences instead of pure harmonic signals. Materials and methods: The proposed system consists of 12 identical channels driven by a <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signal.</b> The power and phase settings are applied with resolutions of 0. 1 W and 0. 1 degrees, respectively.

30|$|Relay {{is a very}} {{promising}} technique for future wireless communication systems to extend coverage and enhance throughput, and has drawn increasing interest from both academia and industry [1 – 6]. There are many types of relays {{and some of them}} have been specified for future mobile systems, such as WiMax and LTE-Advanced system [5]. Two types of relays, i.e., type I and type II, are mainly discussed for LTE-advanced systems in the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) [3, 7 – 9]. The type I relay is a kind of non-transparent relay with wireless backhaul to the donor eNodeB cell. The type I relay terminates all layers 2 and 3 protocols and appears as a normal eNodeB to user equipment (UE). According to the backhaul, type I relay can be classified into inband (same frequency band for backhaul link and access link) and half-duplex (backhaul transmission and access transmission at different time), inband and full-duplex (backhaul transmission and access transmission at same time), and outband (different frequency band for backhaul link and access link). The type I relay has its own cell and physical cell identification (ID). It transmits synchronization signals and performs resource allocation. The typical usage scenarios of type I relay include coverage extension, e.g., hotspot and deadspot, and group mobility, e.g., on a train or bus. On the other hand, the type II relay is a kind of inband transparent relay and works in a half-duplex mode. Usually, the type II relay only supports functions up to layer 2. Type II relay does not have a physical cell ID and is a part of a donor eNodeB cell. The eNodeB directly controls the UEs in the cell and performs resource allocation. The type II relay transparently participates in data forwarding in downlink and uplink, i.e., the UE is not aware of {{whether or not it is}} communicating with the eNodeB via the relay. As a result, the type II relay should not transmit synchronization signal, <b>common</b> <b>reference</b> <b>signal,</b> etc. Therefore, the type II relay cannot be used for coverage extension and the main purpose of the type II relay is to enhance throughput and quality-of-service of UEs, especially for cell-edge UEs, in the macro cell.|$|E

By developing in Fourier series expansion the input <b>reference</b> <b>signals</b> of every joint, an adaptive learning PD control is designed which ‘learns’ the input <b>reference</b> <b>signals</b> by identifying their Fourier coefficients: global asymptotic and local exponential stability of the tracking error dynamics are obtained when the Fourier series expansion of each input <b>reference</b> <b>signal</b> is finite, while arbitrary small tracking errors are achieved otherwise. The resulting control is not model based and depends only on the period of the <b>reference</b> <b>signals</b> and on some constant bounds on the robot dynamics...|$|R
