5|$|In March 1942, Bush sent {{a report}} to Roosevelt {{outlining}} work by Robert Oppenheimer on the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. Oppenheimer's calculations, which Bush had George Kistiakowsky check, estimated that the critical mass of a sphere of uranium-235 was {{in the range of}} 2.5 to 5 kilograms, with a destructive power of around 2,000 tons of TNT. Moreover, it appeared that plutonium might be even more fissile. After conferring with Brigadier General Lucius D. Clay about the <b>construction</b> <b>requirements,</b> Bush drew up a submission for $85 million in fiscal year 1943 for four pilot plants, which he forwarded to Roosevelt on June 17, 1942. With the Army on board, Bush moved to streamline oversight of the project by the OSRD, replacing the S-1 Section with a new S-1 Executive Committee.|$|E

25|$|The bidding date, {{originally}} December 20, 1961, {{was postponed}} to January 22, 1962, {{to clarify the}} details of the arch construction. About 50 companies that had requested the <b>construction</b> <b>requirements</b> received bidding invitations. Extending from $11,923,163 to $12,765,078, all four bids exceeded the engineer estimate of $8,067,000. Wirth had a committee led by George Hartzog determine the validity of the bids in light of the government's conditions. Following a meeting with the bidders, the committee affirmed the bids' reasonableness, and Wirth awarded the lowest bidder, MacDonald Construction Co. of St. Louis, the contract for the construction of the arch and the visitor center. On March 14, 1962, he signed the contract and received from Tucker $2,500,000, the city's subsidy for the phase. MacDonald reduced its bid $500,000 to $11,442,418. The Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Company served as the subcontractor for the shell of the arch.|$|E

2500|$|Construction {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dangerous}} occupations in the world, incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United States and in the European Union. In 2009, the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for all workers. Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers. Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry. Due to the fact that accidents may have disastrous consequences for employees as well as organizations, it is of utmost importance to ensure health and safety of workers and compliance with HSE <b>construction</b> <b>requirements.</b> Health and safety legislation in the construction industry involves many rules and regulations. [...] For example, the role of the Construction Design Management (CDM) Coordinator as a requirement has been aimed at improving health and safety on-site.|$|E

The court used a standard of review that deviated in part from U. S. Supreme Court takings guidelines and instead followed a more conservative script dictated by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal District.

40|$|Abstract. The {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} Ludwieg tube experiment for the verification {{of the existence of}} nonclassical rarefaction shock waves in dense vapors is here critically analyzed by means of real gas numerical simulations of the experimental setup. The Flexible Asym-metric Shock Tube (FAST) setup is a dense gas Ludwieg-type tube in which a rarefaction shock is produced after the opening of the valve separating the reservoir from the charge tube. Quasi-onedimensional simulations of the FAST experiment are presented to support the current design of the experiment. Simulations are performed using the CFD software zFlow linked to the appropriate thermodynamic libraries that implement newly developed thermodynamic models. Off-design situations are also investigated numerically and in-clude uncertainties related to thermodynamic modeling, the possibility of using different fluids and the sensitivity to a small change in the nozzle throat section. The {{preliminary design}} is confirmed to be feasible and <b>constructions</b> <b>requirements</b> are found to be well within technological limits. ...|$|R
