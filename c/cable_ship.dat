5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the sinking, several ships sailed to the disaster area to recover victims' bodies. The White Star Line chartered the <b>cable</b> <b>ship</b> Mackay-Bennett from Halifax, Nova Scotia to retrieve bodies. Three other ships followed in the search: the <b>cable</b> <b>ship</b> Minia, the lighthouse supply ship Montmagny and the sealing vessel Algerine. Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Upon recovery, each body retrieved by the Mackay-Bennett was numbered and given as detailed a description as possible to help aid in identification. The physical appearance of each body—height, weight, age, hair and eye colour, visible birthmarks, scars or tattoos, was catalogued and any personal effects on the bodies were gathered and placed in small canvas bags corresponding to their number.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Calais was {{the first}} <b>cable</b> <b>ship</b> port in Europe and is the fourth largest port in France and the largest for {{passenger}} traffic. The port {{accounts for more than}} a third of economic activity of the town of Calais. Cargo traffic has tripled over the past two decades. In 2007 more than 41.5 million tonnes of traffic passed through Calais with some 11.52 million passengers, 1.4 million trucks and trailers, 2.249 million cars and 4,700 crossings a year. On average, ships sail from the port every 30 minutes. A new 400 million euro project is underway at the port to create a breakwater protecting a pool of 700 meters long, thus allowing virtually all types of ships to stop at Calais.|$|E

Three other Canadian ships followed in the search: the <b>cable</b> <b>ship</b> Minia, lighthouse supply ship Montmagny and sealing vessel Algerine. Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Of the 333 victims that were eventually recovered, 328 were retrieved by the Canadian ships and five more by passing North Atlantic steamships.|$|E

50|$|Modern <b>cable</b> <b>ships</b> differ {{greatly from}} their predecessors. There {{are two main}} types of cable ships: <b>cable</b> repair <b>ships</b> and cable-laying <b>ships.</b> <b>Cable</b> repair <b>ships,</b> like the Japanese Tsugaru Maru, tend to be smaller and more maneuverable; {{they are capable of}} laying cable, but their primary job is fixing or {{repairing}} broken sections of <b>cable.</b> A cable-laying <b>ship,</b> like the Long Lines, is designed to lay new <b>cables.</b> Such <b>ships</b> are bigger than repair ships and less maneuverable; their cable storage drums are also larger and are set in parallel so one drum can feed into another, allowing them to lay cable much faster. These ships are also generally equipped with a liner cable engine (LCE) that helps them lay cable quickly.|$|R
