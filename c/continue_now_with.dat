40|$|Photoproduction of mesons off nuclei, in {{particular}} the deuteron, helium-, and lithium-isotopes, but also heavier ones up to lead, has been studied at the tagged photon beams of the electron accelerators ELSA in Bonn and MAMI in Mainz with the Crystal Barrel/TAPS and Crystal Ball/TAPS experiments. The aim of these measurements was twofold: the study of meson production reactions off quasi-free neutrons {{and the study of}} meson-nucleus interactions. The measurements of quasi-free reactions off the neutron include the observation of a narrow structure, of as yet unknown nature, in the excitation function of eta production off the neutron. These experiments <b>continue</b> <b>now</b> <b>with</b> the measurement of single and double polarization observables. The main topics for the meson-nucleus interactions were the search for eta-mesic nuclei and the investigation of nuclear double-pion production reactions in view of possible in-medium modifications of the sigma-meson.

40|$|Local {{algorithm}} for r = 2 In {{the last}} lecture we discussed Small Word Graphs. We <b>continue</b> <b>now</b> <b>with</b> a proof that when r = 2, {{there exists a}} local algorithm to find a short path from a source vertex s, to a destination vertex t, in O(log n) steps. We reuse Kleinberg’s [1] algorithm from Lecture 15. Algorithm: At each step, select an edge that gets you closest to the destination. Proof: In order to show that this algorithm takes O(log n) steps, we will divide it into phases. We {{will say that the}} algorithm is in phase j if the distance between the current vertex u, and the destination vertex t, is in the range (2 j, 2 j+ 1] as shown in Figure 1. Thus, the expected running time is equal to the expected number of phases, which is O(log n), multiplied by the expected time spent in each phase. Figure 1 : Escape from phase j into phase j + 1. First recall that for small world graphs we have P (u → v) ∝ d −r (u, v) or, equivalently for r = 2 : P (u → v) = where the denominator is a normalizing factor. d− 2 (u, v) w̸=u d− 2 (u, w...|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{unsuccessful}} attempts and unverified claims to recover the power in the carrier of the received signal itself. Traditional crystal sets use half-wave rectifiers. As AM signals have a modulation factor of only 30% by voltage at peaks, no more than 9% of received signal power (...) is actual audio information, and 91% is just rectified DC voltage. Given that the audio signal is unlikely to be at peak all the time, the ratio of energy is, in practice, even greater. Considerable effort was made to convert this DC voltage into sound energy. Some earlier attempts include a one-transistor amplifier in 1966. Sometimes efforts to recover this power are confused with other efforts to produce a more efficient detection. This history <b>continues</b> <b>now</b> <b>with</b> designs as elaborate as [...] "inverted two-wave switching power unit".|$|R

This review charts how ideas about white dwarfs have evolved from the first ANS observations of Sirius B, reported in 1975, through to today. The first studies of atmospheric composition, based on broad band photometric studies with Einstein and EXOSAT are outlined and set the context for the important and often surprising results from the ROSAT sky survey.
