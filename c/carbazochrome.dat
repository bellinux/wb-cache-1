25|$|Coagulation {{dysfunction}} {{is not a}} {{cause of}} EIPH, and anticoagulatory agents, including <b>carbazochrome</b> salicylate, aspirin, Premarin, Amicar, and vitamin K, are not effective in reducing EIPH, {{and in some cases}} may worsen it.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Carbazochrome,</b> the {{semicarbazone}} of adrenochrome, that {{interacts with}} α-adrenoreceptors on surface of platelets, which are coupled to Gq protein and initiate PLC IP3/DAG pathway to increase intracellular free calcium concentration with these subsequent actions: ...|$|E
50|$|Adrenochrome is a {{chemical}} compound with the molecular formula C9H9NO3 {{produced by the}} oxidation of adrenaline (epinephrine). The derivative <b>carbazochrome</b> is a hemostatic medication. Despite a similarity in chemical names, it is unrelated to chrome or chromium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbazochrome</b> is an antihemorrhagic, or hemostatic, {{agent that}} will cease blood flow by causing the {{aggregation}} and adhesion of platelets {{in the blood}} to form a platelet plug, ceasing blood flow from an open wound. It is hoped that this drug {{can be used in}} the future for preventing excessive blood flow during surgical operations and the treatment of hemorrhoids, but research on its effectiveness and the severity of possible side effects remains to be fairly inconclusive.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to quantify the effect of furosemide and <b>carbazochrome</b> on exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) in Standardbred horses using {{red blood cell count}} and hemoglobin concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Six healthy Standardbred horses with prior evidence of EIPH performed a standardized treadmill test 4 h after administration of placebo, furosemide, or furosemide–carbazochrome combination. Red blood cell (RBC) counts and hemoglobin concentrations were determined on the BAL fluid. The RBC count in BAL ranges were (2903 – 26 025 cells/μL), (45 – 24 060 cells/μL), and (905 – 3045 cells/μL) for placebo, furosemide, and furosemide–carbazochrome, respectively. Hemoglobin concentration ranges were (0. 03 – 0. 59 mg/mL), (0. 01 – 0. 55 mg/mL), and (0. 007 – 0. 16 mg/mL) for placebo, furosemide, and furosemide– <b>carbazochrome</b> groups, respectively. No significant differences were detected among treatments. However, there was great variability among horses, suggesting that a larger sample size or better selection of horses was needed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo accurate, {{precise and}} {{sensitive}} RP-HPLC and HPTLC-Densitometric {{methods have been}} developed for the determination of <b>Carbazochrome</b> and Troxerutin in their binary mixture without previous separation. Method (A) is RP-HPLC which depended on isocratic elution using C 18 column and mobile phase consisting of water containing (0. 2 % triethylamine (TEA), 1 % tetrahydrofuran (THF)) :methanol (65 : 35, by volume) at a flow rate of 1. 5 mLmin− 1 and the effluent was monitored at 350 nm. Good resolution was obtained with tR values of 2. 069 and 5. 174 min for <b>Carbazochrome</b> and Troxerutin, respectively. Method (B) is HPTLC-Densitometric method, using silica gel 60 F 254 HPTLC plates and methanol:chloroform:ammonia (40 : 60 : 7, by volume) as a developing system. The bands were scanned at 350 nm. The proposed methods have been validated as per ICH guidelines and their linearity was evident in the ranges of 0. 25 – 10 and 5 – 50 μgmL− 1 for method (A) and 0. 02 – 0. 8 and 0. 1 – 2 μgband− 1 for method (B) for <b>Carbazochrome</b> and Troxerutin, respectively. The developed methods have been applied for the determination of the above mentioned drugs in their pharmaceutical formulation where no interference from the excipients has been detected. Statistical comparison of the results obtained by the developed methods and those obtained by the reported HPLC methods showed no significant difference between them. The developed methods are sensitive, accurate and precise and can be easily used for quality control analysis of the studied drugs...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{described}} the symptoms {{and treatment of}} a patient with diabetic nephropathy accompanied by spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage after hemodialysis. An elderly female patient with diabetic nephropathy presented with severe pain, numbness, and an increasing swelling in the left hip and left thigh after six sessions of hemodialysis involving {{the use of an}} antiplatelet drug and an anticoagulant agent. Her hemoglobin decreased to 46 g/L. An abdominal ultrasound showed a hematoma in the left retroperitoneal space, and computed tomography (CT) findings revealed a 6 cm× 8 cm× 10 cm hematoma in the left psoas muscle. After aggressive supportive therapy [the administration of packed red blood cell transfusion, <b>carbazochrome</b> sodium sulfonate injection, and continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) ], the patient’s vital signs stabilized and her hemoglobin increased to 86 g/L. Repeat CT showed that the hematoma had been partially absorbed after two weeks. Eventually, the patient was discharged with stable vital signs. Physicians {{should be aware of the}} possibility of spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage, particularly in patients with diabetic nephropathy undergoing hemodialysis involving the use of anticoagulant agents...|$|E
30|$|Topical {{hemostasis}} {{and systemic}} replacement therapy are available. For the patients with obvious joint swelling and pain, joint puncture and aspiration technique {{should be performed}} under the conditions of factor VIII supplement and strict local disinfection to reduce stress, relieve pain and reduce the damage of hematocele to articular cartilage and bone. To prevent local infection, chronic fistula formation and fatal septicemia, aspiration, drainage and biopsy should not be performed during treatment. For the late phase joint disease, synovectomy, joint irrigation, arthrodesis or arthroplasty should be performed depending on {{the severity of the}} lesions (Auerswald et al. 2012). Replacement therapy is still preferred in systemic treatment. The factor replacement therapy can be divided into preventive treatment and the treatment based on specific needs of the patients. In 1994, WFH (International Federation of Hemophilia) and WHO established the early preventive treatment as the best treatment protocol for pediatric patients with severe hemophilia. Specifically speaking, the systemic therapy includes the following aspects: (1) Replacement therapy: fresh frozen plasma; cryoprecipitate; genetic engineering products of F VIII; F VIII preparations from animal; recombinant activated factor VIIα preparations; prothrombin complex concentrate; FIX preparations with high purity. (2) Medication-assisted therapy: ranitidine, desmopressin, danazol, antifibrinolytic agents and <b>carbazochrome</b> salicylate. (3) Spleen cell transplantation or spleen transplantation. (4) Gene therapy. Since 1970 s, the morbidity and mortality of hemophilia has been greatly reduced with the effective application of replacement treatment. Since 1980 s, the safety of replacement treatment is guaranteed with the continuous improvement of virus inactivation technology, thereby greatly reducing the incidence of viral hepatitis and AIDS in hemophilia. Since the 1990 s, the widespread application of recombinant coagulation factors not only improves the efficacy, but also avoids the side effects of antibody production and viral infection caused by the application of traditional human-derived clotting factors. Gene therapy achieves success in animal trials. The results of gene therapy in preliminary clinical trials also bring hope to hemophilia patients (High 2014).|$|E
