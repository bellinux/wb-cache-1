40|$|The {{effect of}} a plane {{discontinuity}} on a plane wave propagated in a cylindrical tube is calculated by variational methods. In carrying out the calculations a transmission line analogy is used {{and the effect of}} the discontinuity at a distance is represented by a capacitance placed at the discontinuity. In section 1 the equations of motion for the propagation of a small disturbance in a cylindrical tube are established, culminating in the tyro-dimensional wave equation, while the solutions to the equations are discussed in section 2. These solutions constitute an infinite set of modes, in addition to the plane wave usually treated in the literature. In section 3 the analogy between propagation of sound and an electrical transmission line is established, and it is shown that each mode requires a separate transmission line. In section 4 it is shown that the effect of the higher modes excited by a plane discontinuity may be represented by a lumped capacitance, and this capacitance is given by a variational expression which gives a systematic method of calculation yielding an upper bound to the true answer. For the case of a window, a variational principle is produced inihich gives a lower bound to the true answer. In section B this method is applied to a window in a rectangular tube in some detail, in section 7 it is applied to a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> in a rectangular tube, and in section 8 it is applied to windows and changes of cross section in circular tubes.

40|$|Some {{contemporary}} {{theories of}} basic level object recognition posit visual object recognition {{through the use}} of structural descriptions (i. e., a form of representation in which objects are represented in terms of their parts and the categorical relations among the parts). Much empirical evidence exists supporting this suggestion, yet no empirical investigation has determined the exact visual primitives and categorical relations used in the structural descriptions that humans use for visual object recognition. The current study attempts to identify the exact visual primitives used in basic level object recognition by testing a prosopagnosic patient 2 ̆ 7 s ability to discriminate visual primitives. According to the Coordinate Relations Hypothesis (Cooper 2 ̆ 6 Wojan, 2000), individuals with prosopagnosia should perform normally relative to controls when discriminating visual primitives that are coded distinctly from one another by the visual system, but should be impaired relative to controls when discriminating visual primitives that are coded the same way. Nine studies investigated a prosopagnosic 2 ̆ 7 s ability to discriminate visual primitives (geons, Biederman, 1987) relative to controls. The results indicate that not all of the features defining visual primitives proposed by Biederman are coded uniquely in the human visual system, suggesting that the alphabet of visual primitives used for object recognition is comprised of fewer than the 36 geons proposed by Biederman.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{upgrading}} existing structures {{is of great}} importance due to their deterioration (ageing, environmental induced degradation, lack of maintenance, need to meet the current design requirements). Recently, an innovative structural material, the so-called Textile-Reinforced Mortar (TRM), was successfully developed for structural retrofitting of deficient masonry and concrete structures. TRM is an advanced sustainable material which offers well-established advantages (good behaviour at high temperature, compatibility to concrete or masonry substrates material high strength to weight ratio, corrosion resistance, ease and speed of application, minimal <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> dimensions) at a low-cost and {{over the last decade}} it has been reported in the literature that TRM is a very promising alternative to the FRP (Fibre Reinforced Polymers) retrofitting solution. This study evaluates the use of TRM jacketing for shear strengthening of Reinforced Concrete (RC) beams. First of all, the materials used for strengthening are described and the tensile and shear behaviour of textiles was characterised through tensile and picture-frame tests, repsectively. Moreover, the tensile properties of TRM composite material are experimentally obtained through bell-shaped TRM coupons. Shear strengthening of RC beams was extensively studied carrying out 55 medium-scale rectangular beams and 14 full-scale T-beam ends. The key investigated parameters on medium-scale rectangular beams comprise: (a) the strengthening system (TRM versus FRP), the (b) strengthening configuration, (c) the number of layers, (d) the external reinforcement ratio, (e) the textile material mesh characteristics, (f) the shear-span-to depth ratio and (g) the optimisation of the textile geometry. It was concluded that TRM was very effective on increasing the shear resistance of RC beams but its effectiveness was sensitive to parameters such as the strengthening configuration, the number of layers and the textile characteristics. Experimental work was also conducted on full-scale T-beams focused on the use of a novel end-anchorage system comprising textile-based anchors to delay or prevent the debonding of TRM jacket. In particular, the anchorage percentage of the U-jacket, the number of layers, the textile material, the textile geometry and the strengthening system (TRM versus FRP jackets) were the main investigated parameters. U-shaped TRM jackets significantly increased the shear capacity of full-scale T-beams, whereas the use of textile-based anchors improved dramatically the effectiveness of the TRM jackets. A simple design model was also proposed to calculate the contribution of anchored TRM jackets to the shear capacity of RC T-beams. The behaviour of TRM at high temperature used for shear strengthening of both medium-scale and full-scale beams was studied for the first time through demanding tests in which loading and high temperature were simultaneously applied. Based on the experimental results, TRM jacketing remained very effective at high temperature, whereas the effectiveness of side-bonding and U-wrapping FRP jacketing was reduced nearly to zero when subjected at temperatures above the glass transition temperature (Tg). A stress reduction factor for TRM and FRP systems was also introduced {{to take into account the}} decrease in the effectiveness of both TRM and FRP jacket due to explosion of specimens to high temperature. Finally, design models for the prediction of the contribution of the TRM jacket to the total shear resistance were proposed for each failure mode and verified with the available experimental data...|$|E

Increasing the <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> gullies is an indicator for gully developing (Deng et al, 2015). Topography and soil properties are two important factors in gully developing in various regions of worldwide (Poesena et al, 2003). Despite the importance of soil properties in gully erosion, the direct effect of these agents was less investigated and few researches {{have been carried out}} to the effect of physical and mechanical soil properties on gully erosion. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to determine 1) the effect of topography on gully erosion, 2) effect of surface and subsurface soil physical and mechanical properties on increasing the <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> gullies and 3) to select the most important soil properties affect developing the <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> <b>of</b> gullies in three regions of Ardebil province (Ortadagh, Molla Ahmad, and Sarcham).

40|$|The Solar Neutrino Problems (SNP’s) are {{analysed}} in the Nambu–Jona–Lasinio {{model of}} light nuclei. In this model a possible {{clue to the}} solution of the SNP’s is in the reduction of the solar neutrino fluxes relative to the predicted by the Standard Solar Model through the decrease of the solar core temperature. The former can be realized through the enhancement of the astrophysical factor for the solar proton burning. The enhancement the upper bound of which is restricted by the helioseismological data goes dynamically via the contribution of the nucleon tensor current coupled to the deuteron. The agreement of the reduced solar neutrino fluxes with the experimental data can be reached within a scenario of vacuum two– flavour neutrino oscillations without a fine tuning of the neutrino–flavour oscillation parameters. In the Nambu–Jona–Lasinio model of light nuclei an enhancement of the astrophysical factor for the solar proton burning entails a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cross</b> <b>sections</b> for neutrino and anti–neutrino disintegration of the deuteron at low energies. This provides a theoretical foundation for a new check of a value of the astrophysical factor in terrestrial laboratories...|$|R
