A joint effort of French AREVA and German Siemens AG, {{it will be the}} largest {{pressurized}} water reactor (PWR) in the world. The Olkiluoto project has been claimed to have benefited from various forms of government support and subsidies, including liability limitations, preferential financing rates, and export credit agency subsidies, but the European Commission's investigation didn't find anything illegal in the proceedings. However, as of August 2009, the project is [...] "more than three years behind schedule and at least 55% over budget, reaching a total cost estimate of €5 billion ($7 billion) or close to €3,100 ($4,400) per kilowatt". Finnish electricity <b>consumers</b> <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> ElFi OY evaluated in 2007 the effect of Olkiluoto-3 to be slightly over 6%, or €3/MWh, to the average market price of electricity within Nord Pool Spot. The delay is therefore costing the Nordic countries over 1.3 billion euros per year as the reactor would replace more expensive methods of production and lower the price of electricity.|$|E

50|$|Every {{citizen of}} the United States could be {{described}} as a stakeholder in food policy, but farming and food industry interests are generally the dominant players when advocating for and against legislation and regulation at the federal level; public health advocates and <b>consumer</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> also play a role. Action by the federal government on food policy is often more important to farmers and food manufacturers or distributors because their income is derived from these economic activities, whereas consumers in the U.S. spend only about 10 percent of their income on food. This generally makes farmers or food industry executives easier to organize around policy issues than the public at large.|$|R

Ceteris paribus as the price difference between non-GM and GM food rose, people were more likely to consume GM foods. Likelihood of GM food consumption was higher in the middle income brackets. Consumers were willing to pay an expected premium of 19. 5 % and 16. 12 % for golden rice and GM edible oil respectively. In case of chicken, consumers seemed to pay a very negligible premium for non-GM fed chicken. Overall, it appears that GM foods may be acceptable in the Indian market.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} explore the major techniques, issues, and nascent public policy {{governing}} the practice of medically assisted procreation (MAP). On the one hand, the absence of federal regulation has encouraged the development of what some analysts call the "supermarket of procreation", wherein only financially privileged individuals have access to new reproductive technologies. This market's value is inflated by alarmist discourses, both in popular and scientific literature, relative to supposed high rates of sterility among Americans, especially women. Meanwhile, throughout the different states, access to MAP is undergoing {{a certain number of}} restrictions. Regulations varying from state to state, for the most part emanating from the judicial system or adopted by state legislatures in accordance with judicial rulings, have a tendency to facilitate this access for married heterosexual couples with significant financial means. This has led to the political mobilization of a number of feminist, homosexual, and <b>consumer</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> who denounce discriminatory practices and call for unlimited access to MAP {{in the name of the}} "right to privacy" in matters of procreation as established by the Supreme Court from Griswold v.

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to trace the}} history of the politics, rhetoric and practice of British central government planning in the 1960 s. As such, it {{attempts to}} answer a number of questions: why did 'planning' come back into fashion in the early 1960 s? What meanings did it take on for those who espoused it? Did different groups have very different ideas about what it meant? Why was it adopted as such an all-encompassing reformist banner in this decade? Did it fail to achieve its ends, and if so, why? 'Planning' is therefore treated both as an idea and a practice in its own right, but also as a tool to answer wider questions about post-war British government and politics. How important were <b>interest</b> <b>groups,</b> for instance the 'social partners' of employers and trade unions, in the management of the economy? How central were provider and <b>consumer</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in the planning and development of the Welfare State? How close together were the ideas and actions of the political parties? How powerfull was the central government, and what were the limits to its power? This thesis will use unpublished manuscript sources from the archives of the central government and the two main political parties, along with some personal papers, to attempt to answer these questions. It will conclude that planning failed because of a basic lack of agreement between the different 'planners', as well as the inability of the central government machinery to conduct such complex and testing work. It will also argue that the influence of political ideology and party-political conflict was much greater than has previously been thought...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} four decades, American {{consumers}} have increased the frequency of dining out and, in recent years, have shown an increased interest in having nutrition information available at restaurants. In response to <b>consumer</b> <b>interests</b> {{as well as the}} growing obesity epidemic, restaurants, <b>consumer</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups,</b> and the U.

While other studies have addressed various aspects of nutrition information labeling in restaurants, none have concentrated on consumer response to nutrition information content delivery method within the context of proximity to the guest and resulting required search efforts to obtain the nutrition information. ^ As an exploratory study to establish the Health Conscious Spectrum, a quasi-experimental design was used to examine consumer attitude and behavior in response to nutrition information at four different levels of search effort. The author tested consumer desire for restaurant nutrition information labeling and proximity, and actual use of and effort spent to obtain the information in a full-service restaurant setting. As a result of the analysis, it was found that consumers with both great and little interest in nutrition content are more likely to see and use nutrition labeling information when it is presented either in the menu or in a table tent. Most consumers expressed preference for information available either in the menu or upon request, and would like to see calories and calories from fat listed. According to the results of this study, there were no statistically significant differences between perceived healthiness and having read the nutrition information, however some entrées were perceived to be healthier than others. This study provides valuable insights into characteristics of consumers that use nutrition information in restaurants, and how this information can be used to assist restaurateurs. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the attitudes, {{perceptions}} and knowledge of Islamic financial products and services. Design/methodology/approach - A synoptic survey of empirical analyses about Islamic financial products and services and comparison with the literature on conventional financial services and products. Findings - It was found that while religious conviction is a key factor in the use of Islamic finance, consumers also identify bank reputation, service quality and pricing as being of relevance. When selecting a financial institution 2 ̆ 7 s products and services, business firms usually employ criteria that are more conventional, such as the cost of finance, in their decision making. There is also interest among financial institutions in supplying Islamic financial products and services, but this is mitigated by complications with firm management and a lack of familiarity with business conditions. The concept of risk sharing with borrowers serves as a substantial barrier to most financial institutions engaging in Islamic methods of finance. Research limitations/implications - This survey is limited to work published in refereed journals, books and book chapters. Practical implications - Need for further theoretical and empirical research on how religious convictions affect consumers in their financial decision making. In addition, most work on Islamic finance is in a single national context, international comparisons are required. Originality/value - This paper is the only known empirical survey of attitudes, perceptions and knowledge of Islamic financial products and services. It provides guidance for future research in Islamic finance and serves as an aid for decision making by policymakers, <b>consumer</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups,</b> business firms and financial institutions...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Randomness is {{a common}} and yet quite an {{expensive}} challenge that every manufacturing and marketing system faces. In this research we focus on products for which the malfunction likelihood of the production outputs are not independent of one another, such as flu vaccine and semiconductors. Production has random yield that is interpreted as {{the ratio of the}} faultless items in a production batch. We also assume that these products have a limited marketing season, suggesting the news-vendor model with randomness on the supply side is an outstanding platform to analyze the production and marketing processes of such products. Our base model studies a single manufacturer present in a single market, where the manufacturer dynamically selects the production commitment and the price {{at the beginning of the}} production season and marketing season, accordingly. Also, we assume that demand is deterministic but price dependent. For strategically important products such as the flu vaccine, the government may find it necessary to intervene in the pricing or manufacturing process in order to coordinate the market. The need for coordinating the market may also be met by other <b>consumer</b> <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> such as distribution channel owners, think-tanks or policy making agencies. We incorporate the presence of a social planner in our model by studying the centralized case and the socially optimum production commitment and pricing schema. The challenge is to find contracts that can set the conditions for the manufacturer in a way that his optimum production and pricing policy is exactly the same as the one of the social planner. Our study introduces three contracts that can coordinate the market. In the second phase of this research, we study the same problem for the cases where there are two symmetrical manufacturers with inter-dependent demands. By the third phase, we study the case with one manufacturer who has the option to provide the product to two different markets with different characteristics. Our study shows that production commitment is smaller if there is no randomness and the yield ratio is known. We also show that the production commitment of the centralized setting can be either less or more than the production commitment of the decentralized setting, depending on the salvage cost. Numerical analysis, managerial insights, and conclusions are presented at the end of each chapter...|$|R

40|$|Economists have {{proposed}} several plausible explanations for observed price transmission asym-metries in commodity markets. Unfortunately, the econometric methods {{commonly used in}} such studies cannot empirically distinguish pricing behavior under the competing theories. We argue that the theories may be classified by firm responses to high- and low-frequency price cycles and use Engle’s band spectrum regression to test the symmetry of high- and low-frequency cycles in weekly pork prices. The findings indicate that changes in wholesale prices are asymmetrically transmitted to retail prices in relatively low-frequency cycles, which does not support search costs and other high-frequency explanations. Conversely, wholesale pork prices asymmetrically adjust to changes in farm prices at all frequencies. Key words: asymmetric price transmission, band spectrum regression, pork margins.
