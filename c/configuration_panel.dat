40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} the computational-based ballistic limit of laminated metal panels comprised of {{high strength steel}} and aluminium alloy Al 7075 -T 6 plate at different thickness combinations to necessitate the weight reduction of existing armour steel plate. The numerical models of monolithic configuration, double-layered configuration and triple-layered configuration were developed using a commercial explicit finite element code and were impacted by 7. 62 mm armour piercing projectile at velocity range of 900 to 950 m/s. The ballistic performance of each configuration plate in terms of ballistic limit velocity, penetration process and permanent deformation was quantified and considered. It {{was found that the}} monolithic panel of high-strength steel has the best ballistic performance among all panels, yet it has not caused any weight reduction in existing armour plate. As the weight reduction was increased from 20 - 30 %, the double-layered <b>configuration</b> <b>panels</b> became less resistance to ballistic impact where only at 20 % and 23. 2 % of weight reduction panel could stop the 950 m/s projectile. The triple-layered <b>configuration</b> <b>panels</b> with similar areal density performed much better where all panels subjected to 20 - 30 % weight reductions successfully stopped the 950 m/s projectile. Thus, triple-layered configurations are interesting option in designing a protective structure without sacrificing the performance in achieving weight reduction...|$|R

The first phase of this project involves modeling and implementing of an inverted pendulum system. Aim is to provide a stable control loop to keep a pen in unstable equilibrium, including human pen positioning at startup. Complete anal-ysis of mechanical system is provided through linearized model on operating point, using Matlab Simulink. Our control loop is closed through DVS cameras, providing angle (slope of the captured line) and base position of the moving object. Different types of controllers (from simple PID to self-adaptive controllers and Fuzzy) have been analyzed in detail.

This filter can be manually in the <b>configuration</b> <b>panel</b> ajusted. Another point to be discussed is the startup conditions.

Installation To simplify installation on common operating systems, Taverna distributions for Windows/Linux/OSX now come bundled with the Java Runtime Environment from OpenJDK and the required Graphviz binaries. The installation no longer {{requires you to}} install the JCE Strong Encryption policy. Note that installation on OS X currently requires the XQuartz libraries to be manually installed. XQuartz- 2. 7. 5. dmg (or newer) should be included on the Taverna OS X disk image. If not, see [URL] Available services To improve start-up time and simplify Taverna for users {{in a wide range}} of scientific fields, Available Services are tailored for the scientific domain. For example, the Astronomy distribution includes VAMDC services. Interaction service The Interaction Service has been added to the Workbench. This provides the ability to ask questions and inform users during the running of the workflow. Unlike the previous interactive local workers, this service uses web pages, and therefore also works if using the Command Line tool or the Taverna Server. For details, see [URL] Provenance The Taverna-PROV export has been added. This adds a new button "Save Provenance Bundle" when clicking "Save All" from the results perspective. The provenance bundle is a ZIP file containing all input, output and intermediate values as separate files, along with the provenance of the workflow run. The bundle is based on the Research Object Bundle specification, and complies with the W 3 C PROV-O provenance specification.

Bifurcation occurred in the two half-wave mode longitudinally and one half-wave mode laterally in the quasi-isotropic panels.
