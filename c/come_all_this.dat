500|$|Covering {{the event}} for Doctor Who Magazine, David Darlington {{noted that the}} stated aim of the Proms is [...] "to {{encourage}} an audience for concert hall music who, though not normally attending classical concerts, would be attracted by the low ticket prices and informal atmosphere" [...] and concluded that if {{the children in the}} audience had such a love for Doctor Who [...] "that they have <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way to spend an hour or two listening to the music from the show, and that they will happily also sit through a formal, experimental and rather abrasive piece of modern classical music and then enthusiastically applaud at the end, then all concerned can be happy with their day's work." ...|$|E

That the scene of blood may be speedily closed; that order, harmony and peace may be effectually restored, and truth and justice, {{religion}} and piety, prevail and flourish amongst the people. Preserve the health of their bodies and vigor of their minds; shower down on them and the millions they here represent, such temporal blessings as Thou seest expedient for them {{in this world and}} crown them with everlasting glory in the world to <b>come.</b> <b>All</b> <b>this</b> we ask in the name and through the merits of Jesus Christ, Thy Son and our Savior.|$|E
2500|$|Brian Close was {{replaced}} by Colin Cowdrey for the MCC tour of the West Indies in 1967–68, his third spell as England captain and {{he was determined to}} make a success of it. Barrington and the MCC fared poorly in the run up matches and with West Indian supporters constantly telling him [...] "Charlie's waiting for you man. He'll kill you". Barrington was so upset that told his wife that he wouldn't tour again. In the First Test at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad Cowdrey won the toss and batted with Boycott and Edrich adding 80 for the first wicket and Barrington coming in against the spinners at 110/2. Soon after Gary Sobers responded to the crowd and brought on Griffith, but Barrington twice called him to halt as the chanting of the crowd interfered with his concentration. Although hit with bouncers on the shoulders and back he survived the five over spell and the tired bowler was taken off. He brought up his 50 with a six off Lance Gibbs and added 134 with Cowdrey and 188 with Tom Graveney before hitting Gibbs for another six to bring up his 20th century. When he saw the ball sailing into the stands the 37-year-old Barrington took off his cap and waved his fist in triumph. He was finally caught by Griffith off Gibbs for 143, the second time that he had made a century in four successive Tests. England made 568 and the West Indies followed on (Barrington dismissing Sobers), but survived the last day on 243/8 for a draw. Barrington made 63 in the Second Test at Sabina Park, Jamaica, again stopping Griffith's run up as the crowd went wild. John Snow took 7/49 and the West Indies followed on again, but when the local favourite Basil Butcher was out at 204/5 the crowd disagreed with the decision and rioted, even though Butcher had walked. Tear gas was used by the Jamaican police to restore order and play resumed, but the England team lost their hold on the game as Sobers made 113 not out and the West indies 391/9. Needing only 159 to win England collapsed to 68/8 (Barrington 13), but somehow managed a draw. The Third Test at Bridgetown, Barbados was another draw (Barrington 17) and the Fourth back at Trinidad looked like going the same way. The West Indies had made 526/7 and England replied with 404, where Cowdrey (148) and Barrington (48) added 133 for the third wicket. Sobers, remembering the England collapse in the Second Test declared at 92/2 leaving England 215 to win in 135 minutes, a run-rate they had yet to achieve in the series [...] Cowdrey was uncertain, but Barrington convinced him to go for the win, shouting [...] "Will we go for it? Of course we'll go for it. That's what we've <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way for, isn't it?" [...] Barrington did not bat, but England made 215/3 and won by seven wickets. Sobers was lambasted by the Caribbean press for his cavalier declaration, but responded in the Fifth Test in Georgetown, Guyana with 152 and 95 not out, Barrington taking his wicket again in the first innings, and England were struggling at 206/9 when stumps were pulled on the last day, but they drew the match and won the series. Barrington had made only 4 and 0, but finished with 288 runs (41.14) and 5 wickets (51.40), having dismissed Sobers and Seymour Nurse twice each and the opener Steve Camacho.|$|E
6000|$|The servant {{stood and}} stared like one bereft of wits. [...] "How <b>comes</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> change?" [...] said he, [...] "and {{how did you}} get all these grand things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So far I had {{not seen}} a thing to laugh at, but I was deeply interested. 'How <b>came</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> to be known?' I asked. 'Has Miss Temple gone about telling people?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now give me {{no more of}} thy talk," [...] {{said the}} woman, [...] "but do the work that thou hast been bidden." [...] Then--"How <b>came</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> black soot here, I should like to know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my lord; I'm {{sure your}} lordship can't understand. That's why I {{have thought it}} my duty to <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way to explain it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did we <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way, then?" [...] Dorle asked, {{looking around}} at the other men. [...] "There's no point even in landing. Let's go back at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear!" [...] he said. [...] "I have <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way, {{through all}} these terrible places, to help you, and now I am of no use at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|John {{could hold}} his tongue this time. [...] "And you <b>came</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way by night, twenty miles and odd, to warn Captain Carbonel, on your aunt's information?" [...] said Sir Harry, thoughtfully. [...] "Are {{you sure that}} she could hear distinctly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{really think}} I’m the most forgetful man in Salt-haven," [...] said Mr. Robert Vyner, in tones of grave annoyance, as he ranged alongside. [...] "I <b>came</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> {{way to show}} your father a book on dahlias, and now I find I’ve left it at the office. What’s {{a good thing for}} a bad memory?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Afterwards, Hornish {{commented on}} his last-second pass, [...] "I figured I <b>came</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way, I {{ought to give}} myself one more shot at it. I kind of looked at it as, I was going to drive over him if I had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like {{that he should be}} proud no matter what." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And is {{that his}} errand, here?--Did he really <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> distance, across mountain, and valley, rivers and lakes, to torment his fellow creatures, and do so wicked a thing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a pity, now, {{that you}} should be so {{careless}} of me, when I was so thoughtful of you! I have <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> distance, to see how you do." ...|$|E
60|$|Like most {{literary}} {{people who}} put their friends into books, she is very modest, and it never seems to strike her that I would <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way to see her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{you shall}} do it,' {{returned}} his father. 'And you see, Paul,' he added, dropping his voice, 'how powerful money is, and how anxious people are to get it. Young Gay <b>comes</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way {{to beg for}} money, and you, who are so grand and great, having got it, are {{going to let him}} have it, as a great favour and obligation.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What is all this?' he thought. 'How <b>came</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> to occur? How {{has arisen}} this {{singular}} combination of unforeseen causes and undreamed-of circumstances, which baffles all my plans and resolutions, and seems, as it were, without my sanction and my agency, {{to be taking}} possession of my destiny and life? I am bewildered, confounded, incapable of thought or deed.' ...|$|R
60|$|Let no one pity me! A curious {{pleasure}} <b>came</b> with <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> for {{it seemed}} to advance the reconstruction with double swiftness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, my dears," [...] {{said the}} King, [...] "and {{tell me why}} you have <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way to see me, and what I can do to make you happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{really it}} is too ridiculous--too provoking--to have <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way and not get it,' cried the tantalised Nuttie. 'Oh, Gerard, are you taking off your boots and stockings? You duck!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'His {{back against}} a rock he bore, [...] And firmly placed his foot before: [...] "Come one, <b>come</b> <b>all!</b> <b>This</b> rock shall fly [...] From its firm base as soon as I."'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good-bye, my dear,' she said; 'I {{know the}} day will <b>come</b> when <b>all</b> <b>this</b> will be made up. You know how I have loved you both.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bertram turned {{towards the}} table, and buried {{his face in}} his hands. He did not {{understand}} it. He did not know whence <b>came</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> opposition. He could not conceive what was the motive power which caused his nephew thus to thwart and throw him over, standing forward as he did with thousands and tens of thousands in his hand. But he knew that his request was refused, and he felt himself degraded and powerless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please, ma'am," [...] {{said the}} boy, [...] "I've lost a shillin', and I can't find it nowheres. Oh, wot ever shall I do? My mother gave it {{me to give}} with two other bobs to my poor sick brother whom I've <b>comed</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way to see, and there I've gone an' lost it, an' I'll 'ave to lay out all night in the cold, for I dursn't go to see 'im without the money--boo, hoo!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If we hadn't invented them, {{they would}} have." [...] Leone lit a {{cigarette}} shakily. [...] "I wonder why a Russian would <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way alone. I didn't see anyone covering him." ...|$|E
60|$|NAPOLEON [following her] Madam: I {{have not}} <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way to discuss matters of State with a woman. I must {{ask you to}} direct me to one of your oldest and ablest men.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so," [...] said Rollo, in a {{disappointed}} tone, [...] "though we {{have taken}} the pains to <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way to see the waterfall, we can't get near enough to see it after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How good of you, to <b>come</b> through <b>all</b> <b>this</b> heat, and not {{to laugh}} at my despair!" [...] she said, looking up like a {{grateful}} child, as she led him in.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next morning}} the king and the prime-minister were talking over what they had seen. [...] "Sire," [...] said the prime-minister, [...] "I have no doubt but {{that the young man}} has {{discovered}} some vast hidden treasure. Now, according to the laws of this kingdom, the half of any treasure that is discovered shall belong to the king's treasury. If I were in your place I would send for this young man and compel him to tell me whence <b>comes</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> vast wealth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, goodbye, Mr. Lindsay! Even {{if nothing}} <b>comes</b> of <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> {{it will be}} {{pleasant}} {{for me to know}} that, at least, I have one faithful friend who was true to me, in my deepest adversity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I call it {{good of you}} to <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way to see me," [...] {{said the}} captain, after the boy had disappeared; [...] "but you always was warm-hearted, Pepper. And how’s the missis?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I say," [...] cried Newman, with energy, [...] "you are {{not going}} to lock me up in a club and stick me down at a card-table! I haven't <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way for that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I {{hope you}} will soon be with him,' said Arthur. 'But, Mademoiselle, let me present you to the Grand Marabout, a sort of Moslem Abbe, who has <b>come</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> way to obtain your release.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "An extreme foolishness," [...] said I, [...] "All these loud {{words and}} {{beautiful}} poses... {{they will not}} pass, yet it moves, motherland or death, am able to die for my beliefs — <b>all</b> of <b>this</b> becomes nonsense when real death <b>comes...</b> <b>All</b> of <b>this</b> is for kids.

6000|$|... "But," [...] Mr. Spencer Wyatt remarked, [...] "if {{you have}} <b>come</b> into <b>all</b> <b>this</b> information, Mr. Norgate, why didn't {{you go to}} your friend Hebblethwaite? Why haven't you communicated with the police and given this German spy of yours into charge?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay, I won't {{come in with}} you, Micah,' said he; 'there's {{mischief}} {{likely to}} <b>come</b> of <b>all</b> <b>this.</b> My father may grumble over his beer jugs, but he's a Churchman and a Tantivy for all that. I'd best keep out of it.' ...|$|R
