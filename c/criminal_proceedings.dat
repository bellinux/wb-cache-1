5|$|In {{parallel}} with the second investigation, a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle. In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy. In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove's inquiry, {{on the grounds that}} it might help their clients; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview notes were genuine and that Silcott really had, in effect, confessed.

Church sanctions seldom held official recognition outside church membership and seldom resulted in civil or <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Nevertheless, such sanctions were a powerful tool of social control.|$|E

5|$|Johnson sought {{nomination}} by the 1868 Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1868. He remained {{very popular}} among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, {{just before the}} convention, a pardon ending the possibility of <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis {{and a few others}} still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative George H. Pendleton, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor Horatio Seymour was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} by Evan Chandler, on behalf of his then-13-year-old child, Jordan Chandler. To the father's disapproval and concern, his son had become friends with the {{musician}} in May 1992. Allegedly under the influence of a controversial sedative administered by Evan Chandler, a dentist, his son said that Jackson had touched his penis. Evan Chandler was tape-recorded threatening to damage the singer's music career, and engaged Jackson in unsuccessful negotiations to resolve the issue with a financial settlement. Jordan Chandler then told a psychiatrist and later police that he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral sex. Jackson settled a civil suit out of court with the Chandler family and their legal team for $22,000,000 in January 1994. After Jordan Chandler refused to testify in the <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the state closed its criminal investigation citing lack of evidence, and Jackson was not charged with a crime. Jordan Chandler later admitted to lying. After Jackson's death, Evan Chandler committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Manningham RFC {{continued}} playing until 1903, when financial difficulties, {{caused by}} relegation {{at the turn}} of the century, prompted club officials to change codes from rugby football to association football. The first association football game to be played at Valley Parade was a promotional fixture on 6 April 1903 between a side of West Yorkshire footballers and Sheffield United's 1903 FA Cup winning side. The game had been organised to stimulate interest in the sport in Bradford and attracted 8,000 fans. The new football club, Bradford City, were elected to The Football League's Division Two the following month. Bradford City's first game at Valley Parade came on 5 September 1903 against Gainsborough Trinity, drawing a crowd of 11,000. As a result of alterations first implemented in 1897, City players originally changed in a shed behind one end of the ground, and visiting teams used the old rugby club dressing rooms at the back of the nearby Belle Vue Hotel. However, after City's 5–1 defeat by Manchester United on 10 February 1906, United player Bob Bonthron was attacked as he left the ground. As a result, The Football Association closed the ground for 14 days, ordering City to switch its changing rooms to the nearby Artillery Barracks for the 1906–07 season. Several supporters faced <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> for the incident.|$|E
