500|$|In 1649, {{during the}} English Civil War, Parliament {{published}} {{a series of}} orders to reform the Court. Most were from the doctrines set out by Francis Bacon as Lord Chancellor, {{but there were some}} more modern reforms: counsels to the defendants could deliver pleas, rather than defendants in person, thus saving the cost of a <b>Commissioner</b> <b>of</b> <b>Oaths,</b> and cases were to be heard in the order they were accepted by the court. Parliament also fixed the fees that officers could charge, in an attempt to reduce the expense of a case. The following year, Parliament appointed a commission to look at court reform; this made many recommendations, but none that directly affected the Chancery. In August 1653 another debate took place in Parliament, lasting two days, in which a paper titled [...] "Observations concerning the Court of Chancery" [...] was circulated; this concerned the costs, workings, and officers of the Court. A second paper was given out, [...] "for the regulation or taking away of the Court of Chancery, and settling the business of Equity according to the original and primitive constitution of it; and for taking away all unnecessary fees, offices and officers and formalities now used, and for the speedy dispatch of business".|$|E

[...] "Such {{witnesses}} as will carry absolute conviction to the mind of all the world; irreproachable, disinterested witnesses; official witnesses. In the first place, a <b>commissioner</b> <b>of</b> <b>oaths.</b> Then a Plymouth doctor, {{to show that you}} are in a fit state of mind to make a confession. Next, Mr. Horace Mayfield, who defended my father. Lastly, Dr. Blake Crawford, who watched the case on your behalf at the trial." ...|$|E

In the room of the sick man our other witnesses were waiting: a tall, dark, austere man who was introduced to me as Dr. Blake Crawford, whose name I had heard as having watched the case for Sebastian {{at the time of}} the investigation. There were present also a <b>commissioner</b> <b>of</b> <b>oaths,</b> and Dr. Mayby, a small local practitioner, whose attitude towards the great scientist was almost absurdly reverential. The three men were grouped at the foot of the bed, and Mayfield and I joined them. Hilda stood beside the dying man, and rearranged the pillow against which he was propped. Then she held some brandy to his lips. [...] "Now!" [...] said she.|$|E

5000|$|In {{practice}} {{the need for}} notaries in purely English legal matters is very small; for example they {{are not involved in}} normal property transactions. Since a great many solicitors also perform the function <b>of</b> <b>commissioners</b> for <b>oaths</b> and can witness routine declarations etc. (all are qualified to do so, but not all offer the service), most work performed by notaries relates to international matters in some way. They witness or authenticate documents to be used abroad. Many English notaries have strong foreign language skills and often a foreign legal qualification. The work of notaries and solicitors in England is separate although most notaries are solicitors. The Notaries Society gives the number of notaries in England and Wales as [...] "about 1,000," [...] all but seventy of whom are solicitors.|$|R
