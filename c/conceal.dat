50|$|<b>Concealed</b> carry (carrying a <b>concealed</b> weapon (CCW)), {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of carrying a handgun or other weapon in public in a <b>concealed</b> or hidden manner, either on one's person or in close proximity. While most law enforcement officers carry their handguns in a visible holster, some officers, such as plainclothes detectives or undercover agents, carry weapons in <b>concealed</b> holsters. In some countries and jurisdictions, civilians are legally able or obliged to carry <b>concealed</b> handguns.|$|R
50|$|New Mexico's current <b>concealed</b> carry permit law {{was enacted}} in 2003. Prior to 2003, New Mexico was a hybrid No-Issue/Unrestricted state, where <b>concealed</b> carry was {{completely}} banned in incorporated {{cities and towns}} (although open carry without a permit has always been permitted statewide). In unincorporated rural areas, <b>concealed</b> carry without a license was legal. In 2001, state lawmakers passed a May-Issue <b>concealed</b> carry law {{that would have allowed}} cities and counties to opt out of honoring <b>concealed</b> carry permits and maintain outright bans on <b>concealed</b> carry. At the time, officials in most larger cities, notably Albuquerque and Santa Fe, strongly opposed the legalization of statewide <b>concealed</b> carry. After the May-Issue law was enacted but before it could go into effect, the City of Albuquerque filed a lawsuit (Baca v. New Mexico Department of Public Safety) to block implementation of the <b>concealed</b> carry law. Ultimately the May-Issue <b>concealed</b> carry law was struck down by the New Mexico Supreme Court before it could go into effect. The current Shall-Issue law, which pre-empted any existing local restrictions on firearms carry, was passed in 2003, with the issuance of <b>Concealed</b> Handgun Licenses beginning later that year, after surviving its own legal challenge by <b>concealed</b> carry opponents.|$|R
40|$|<b>Concealed</b> cars {{extraction}} {{from point}} clouds data acquired by airborne laser scanning has gained its popularity in recent years. However, {{due to the}} occlusion effect, the number of laser points for <b>concealed</b> cars under trees is not enough. Thus, the <b>concealed</b> cars extraction is difficult and unreliable. In this paper, 3 D point cloud segmentation and classification approach based on full-waveform LiDAR was presented. This approach first employed the autocorrelation G coefficient and the echo ratio to determine <b>concealed</b> cars areas. Then the points in the <b>concealed</b> cars areas were segmented with regard to elevation distribution of <b>concealed</b> cars. Based on the previous steps, a strategy integrating backscattered waveform features and the view histogram descriptor was developed to train sample data of <b>concealed</b> cars and generate the feature pattern. Finally <b>concealed</b> cars were classified by pattern matching. The approach was validated by full-waveform LiDAR data and experimental results demonstrated that the presented approach can extract <b>concealed</b> cars with accuracy more than 78. 6 % in the experiment areas. </p...|$|R

5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} <b>conceal</b> their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or <b>conceal</b> their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor was}} the weather within the {{operational}} theater.

Lack of adequate all-weather and night-bombing capability made it necessary for the majority of U.S. missions to be conducted during daylight hours, thereby easing the burden on the air defense forces of North Vietnam.|$|E

The project encompasses empirical data formed in three focus groups, in which users of In-stagram present their attitudes towards and experience with <b>concealed</b> advertising on Instagram.

In the present study, we used a dot probe task in order to test this hypothesis.

Participants made more errors in this task after presentation of <b>concealed</b> information, compared with both familiar non-relevant and unfamiliar information.
