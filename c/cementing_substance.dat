60|$|Section 57. It is {{convenient}} to divide tissues into three classes, though the divisions {{are by no}} means clearly marked, nor have they any scientific value. The first of these comprises tissues composed wholly, or with the exception of an almost imperceptible <b>cementing</b> <b>substance,</b> of cells; the second division includes the skeletal tissues, the tissue of mesentery, and the connective and basement tissue of most of the organs, tissues which, generally speaking, consist of a matrix or embedding substance, formed by the cells and outside of them, as well as the cells themselves; and, thirdly, muscular and nervous tissue. We shall study the former two in this chapter, and defer the third division until later.|$|E
60|$|Geographical Range; Habitats.--The Pedunculated Cirripedes extend {{over the}} whole world; {{and most of the}} {{individual}} species have large ranges, more especially, as might have been expected, those attached to floating objects; excepting these latter, the greater number inhabit the warmer temperate, and tropical seas. Of those attached to fixed objects, or to littoral animals, it is rare to find more than three or four species in the same locality. On the shores of Europe I know of only three, viz., a Scalpellum, Pollicipes, and Alepas. At Madeira (owing to the admirable researches of the Rev. R. T. Lowe), two Pæcilasmas, a Dichelaspis, and an Oxynaspis are known. In New Zealand, there are two Pollicipes and an Alepas, and, perhaps, a fourth form. From the Philippine Archipelago, in the great collection made by Mr. Cuming, there are a Pæcilasma, an Ibla, a Scalpellum, Pollicipes, and Lithotrya. Of all the Lepadidæ, nearly half are attached to floating objects, or to animals which are able to change their positions; the other half are generally attached to fixed organic or inorganic bodies, and more frequently to the former than to the latter. Most of the species of Scalpellum are inhabitants of deep water; on the other hand, most of Pollicipes,[21] of Ibla, and Lithotrya are littoral forms. The species of Lithotrya have the power of excavating burrows in calcareous rocks, shells, and corals; and the singular manner in which this is effected, is described under that genus. Anelasma has its sub-globular peduncle deeply embedded in the flesh of Northern Sharks; and I have seen instances of the basal end of the peduncle of Conchoderma aurita, being sunk into the skin of Cetacea; in the same way the point of the peduncle in the male of Ibla, is generally deeply embedded in the sack of the female. I believe in all these cases, the <b>cementing</b> <b>substance</b> affects and injures the corium or true skin of the animal on which the creature is parasitic, whilst the surrounding parts, being not injured, continue to grow upwards, thus causing the partial embedment of the Cirripede. In the case of Anelasma, we have growth {{at the end of the}} peduncle, and consequently downward pressure, and this may possibly cause absorption to take place in the skin of the shark at the spot pressed on.|$|E

40|$|Existence {{and nature}} of the <b>cement</b> <b>substance</b> which binds the collagenous fibers and fibrils have been widely discussed. It has been shown that this material, {{probably}} mucoproteins, can be, at least partially, removed from the fibers not only by salts such as KC 1 and CaC 12, but also by treating the fibers with trypsin (13). A <b>cement</b> <b>substance</b> which is probably of a nature similar to that within the microscopically visible fibers has been shown by the electron microscope to be present between the cross-banded microfibrils (Wassermann (13)). Considering the coexistence of mucopolysaccharides and collagenous material during fibrillogenesis, it may be asked whether or not mucopolysaccharides take part in the building and the structure of the collagenous microfibrils. This question has been raised repeatedly, and several authors using chemical and physicochemical methods {{came to the conclusion that}} a collagen-mucopolysaccharide complex does exist (Burton et al.

40|$|AT the {{periphery}} of the cornea the corneal endothelium passes over the margin of Descemet's membrane to the trabecular meshwork (Vrabec, 1957). The size and shape of the cells of the corneal endothelium undergo a peculiar change in approaching this region (Vrabec, 1958 a). A study by means of the replica method (Vrabec, 1958 b) demonstrated that the endothelial cells became elongated in the meridional direction and then lost their outlines in the region of the anterior border of Schwalbe's ring. Only a few nuclei were seen by the replica technique. The results of examining the endothelium of this zone of transition by various methods is described below. Material and Methods The eyes of the cat, rabbit, and rhesus monkey were studied, together with some human eyes with different pathological conditions, and one human eye which was clinically niormal but was enucleated because of an orbital tumour. The basic method used was again the silver impregnation method of McGovern (1955, 1956). The results were compared with those obtained by the replica and pseudo-replica methods, the latter mostly with additional staining. Even in the apparently normal eye, the possibility of functional changes in the secretion of the <b>cement</b> <b>substance</b> {{as well as of the}} covering substance should be borne in mind. The specimens used were either frozen sections or teased preparations; most of them were mounted in Apathy's syrup to prevent excessive dehydration and shrinkage of the cement substance; some specimens mounted in Canada balsam showed that the <b>cement</b> <b>substance</b> seems much more resistant to dehydration after impregnation with silver. Findings The cells of the corneal endothelium, as they approach the corneal margin, become elongated in the meridional direction and sometimes form fan-shaped groups.

Ozobranchus branchiatus are known to complete their entire life cycle on host turtles, which is an unusual trait shared only by a few other species of leeches. This is accomplished by laying eggs on the turtle and attaching them with a <b>cementing</b> <b>substance.</b> The eggs will hatch and attach to the host turtle.

50|$|The redeposited {{cementing}} material is most commonly calcareous or siliceous. Limestones, which were originally a loose accumulation of shells, corals, etc., become compacted into firm rock in this manner; {{and the process}} often takes place with surprising ease, as for example in the deeper parts of coral reefs, or even in wind-blown masses of shelly sand exposed merely to the action of rain. The <b>cementing</b> <b>substance</b> may be regularly deposited in crystalline continuity on the original grains, where these were crystalline; and even in sandstones (such as Kentish Rag) a crystalline matrix of calcite often envelops the sand grains. The change of aragonite to calcite and of calcite to dolomite, by forming new crystalline masses {{in the interior of}} the rock, usually also accelerates consolidations. Silica is less easily soluble in ordinary waters, but even this ingredient of rocks is dissolved and redeposited with great frequency. Many sandstones are held together by an infinitesimal amount of colloid or cryptocrystalline silica; when freshly dug from the quarry they are soft and easily trimmed, but after exposure to the air for some time they become much harder, as their siliceous cement sets and passes into a rigid condition. Others contain fine scales of kaolin or of mica. Argillaceous materials may be compacted by mere pressure, like graphite and other scaly minerals.|$|E

In addition, the transcriptions of both spiggin gene were induced by only androgenic stimulation in a receptor-mediated manner. These findings suggest the multiplicity albeit specificity of spiggin in the stickleback. The quantification system for spiggin mRNA was established using a real-time RT-PCR technique.

40|$|Abstract: The first {{geological}} {{studies of}} the Quaternary deposits, which crop out extensively {{along the coast of}} Western Australia, were carried out by members of English and French expeditions of discovery, between 1791 and 1836. The exploring parties included scholars with a background in geology, zoology and botany, as well as knowledgeable surgeons and sea captains with a strong interest in the natural sciences. Their collective work established the continuity, over vast distances, of a sequence of sedimentary rocks composed of quartz grains and shell debris, which today form the major part of the Tamala Limestone sequence. Their observations of the internal features of these rocks led some among them to develop views on the nature and origin of the <b>cementing</b> <b>substance</b> that bonds sand grains and shell debris in sedimentary layers and in concretions. There was disagreement among successive parties of visitors on the nature and origin of rhizoliths and other petrified woody matter in calcareous rocks. The finding of well-preserved sea shells in rocks now above sea level provided convincing evidence to investigators that the ocean had, in recent times, retreated from the land.

40|$|The {{nature of}} dietary factors {{contributing}} {{to the maintenance of}} vascular integrity has not, as yet, been satisfactorily elucidated. However, vitamin C appears to play a specific role (1 - 3) by functioning in some manner to incorporate the vas-cular <b>cement</b> <b>substance.</b> The significance of other agents in alleviating "vascular purpura " has re-mained inconclusive. It has been claimed that "vascular permeability" is dependent upon regulation by the entire class of "vitamin P " substances. Since 1936, the experi-mental device of eliminating "vitamin P " from the diet of guinea pigs has been the customary ap-proach with markedly contradictory observations recorded (4 - 10). Recent investigations in this laboratory have utilized a somewhat different principle in a study of exogenous agents contrib-uting to vascular repair (11, 12). Roentgen ir-radiation disease in dogs induces a train of patho-logical phenomena secondary to a generalized cel-lular disturbance (13). Since a purpura has been an invariable feature of controlled roentgen irradi-ation, anti-hemorrhagic agents have been consid-ered, but vitamins K, C and the B complex and calcium have proven ineffective (14).

So far, only the claws and nails of mammals have been characterized extensively and the question of whether claws were present in the common ancestor of all extant tetrapods is as yet unresolved. To provide a basis for comparisons between amniote and non-amniote claws, we investigated the development, growth and ultrastructure of the epidermal component of the claws of X. laevis. Histological examination of developing claws of X. laevis shows that claw formation is initiated {{at the tip of the}} toe by the appearance of superficial cornified cells that are dark brown. Subsequent accumulation of new, proximally extended claw sheath corneocyte layers increases the length of the claw. Histological studies of adult claws show that proliferation of cornifying claw sheath cells occurs along the entire length of the claw-forming epidermis. Living epidermal cells that are converting into the cornified claw sheath corneocytes undergo a form of programmed cell death that is accompanied by degradation of nuclear DNA. Subsequently, the cytoplasm and the nuclear remnants acquire a brown colour by an as-yet unknown mechanism that is likely homologous to the colouration mechanism that occurs in other hard, cornified structures of amphibians such as nuptial pads and tadpole beaks. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the cornified claw sheath consists of parallel layers of corneocytes with interdigitations being confined to intra-layer contacts and a <b>cementing</b> <b>substance</b> filling the intercorneocyte spaces. Together with recent reports that showed the main molecular components of amniote claws are absent in Xenopus, our data support the hypothesis that claws of amphibians likely represent clade-specific innovations, non-homologous to amniote claws...|$|E

When the partially purified IgG fraction from the pooled sera of patients with pemphigus vulgaris or pemphigus foliaceous was added to this culture system, after 24 hr some evidence of epidermal acantholysis was seen. By 72 hr, extensive suprabasilar epidermal acantholysis had occurred in which the acantholytic cells were indistinguishable histologically from the acantholytic cells in biopsies from skin lesions of patients with pemphigus vulgaris. In the control cultures (i. e., F- 10 medium or F- 10 medium + normal human serum IgG), none of these changes was seen. Direct immunofluorescent staining of these explants using fluorescein-labeled goat antihuman IgG showed that by 6 hr binding of the pemphigus IgG had occurred in the intercellular <b>cement</b> <b>substance</b> of the epidermis. The staining intensity was maximal by 18 to 20 hr. When the pemphigus serum was fractionated by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, three major IgG-containing peaks (presumably IgG subclasses) were eluted which bound to the epidermal intercellular substance and caused acantholysis in culture.

Evidence is presented that the mechanism of cell adhesion does not involve calcium atoms binding cells to substrate by combining with earboxyl groups on cell surface, substrate, and with a <b>cement</b> <b>substance.</b> Osmium tetroxide fixation results in a final separation of 100 to 200 A between cell and substrate: there are reasons for thinking that this fairly close approach to the condition in life is produced as an artefact. The results can be accounted for only in terms of the action of electrostatic repulsive forces and an attractive force, probably the van der Waals [...] London forces. Biological arguments suggest that these results are equally applicable for ceil-to-cell adhesions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{supplementary}} Biotin {{on the horn}} quality of the bovine hoof was studied on 24 dairy cows of different breeds. A comparative trial was set up and the animals were allocated to either a supplemented group (15 animals receiving 10 to 20 mg of Biotin per day) or a control group (nine animals receiving a placebo). The trial lasted for one year during which the herd was visited prior to supplementation and again at regular intervals. Horn and milk samples were taken every four months and the hooves were assessed for clinical status. Horn samples from the heel segment and the abaxial end of the white line were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy, their protein composition was studied by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot. The poor clinical condition of the hind claws {{at the beginning of}} the trial improved remarkably in the supplemented group after nine months of additional Biotin and remained unchanged in the control group. Inter- and intracellular changes in the ultrastructure of the horn cell cluster trace back to an effect of Biotin on the energy and lipid metabolism of the differentiating keratinocyte. Changes in ultrastructure and composition of the intercellular <b>cementing</b> <b>substance</b> between the horn cells resulted in an improvement of horn quality. Inside the horn cells the keratin filaments and their associated proteins were more clearly distinguishable compared to the initial status, probably due to changes in the intermolecular linkages. Proteins isolated from bovine hoof horn are separable into two fractions of different electrophoretic mobility. One fraction (14 kD - 30 kD) includes the intermediate filament associated proteins and showed no reaction with the chosen antibodies (CK 10, CK 5 / 6 and CK 14) against human cytokeratins. The other fraction comprises the keratin proteins with a molecular weight range between 44, 5 kD and 57, 5 kD. Four acidic and two basic cytokeratins were distinguished by their reaction with two different polyvalent antibodies (AE 1 and AE 3) and identified using antibodies against specific human cytokeratins (CK 10, CK 5 / 6 and CK 14). Postranslational modification of proteins during terminal differentiation reduces the size of the keratinproteins inside the horn cells by about 5 kD compared to the living layers of the epidermis and shows individual variability. Changes in the pattern of protein bands at the end of the trial affected the supplemented group to a greater extent than the control group...|$|E
40|$|There are {{now many}} {{research}} papers published that indicate that an oral biotin supplement can be beneficial {{as part of}} a control programme to reduce lameness in cattle. These research papers are of varying quality, but the weight of evidence biologically and statistically indicates that biotin is most likely to act by improving hoof horn quality and so reduce diseases that occur with damage to hoof horn integrity; the most common of these diseases in GB are white line disease and sole ulcer. Biotin acts at a cellular level by activation of protein synthesis; it has important functions in cellular lipid metabolism and lipid synthesis and according to recent results also influences/modulates expression of certain genes. Most important for its effects on claw horn structure and integrity is the role biotin plays in lipid synthesis. Biotin is an essential co-factor for enzymes involved in de novo synthesis of fatty acids or in synthesis of long chain fatty acids by chain elongation. Fatty acids and, in particular long chain fatty acid which are not present in the diet, are components of the complex lipids within the intercellular <b>cementing</b> <b>substance</b> of hoof horn. This cement establishes cell adhesion between the horn cells. Its quality is directly linked to hoof horn integrity. Biotin also influences keratin protein synthesis via activation on protein synthesis and thus helps improving stability of horn cells. Whether and to what extent the effects on gene expression are involved in the effects of biotin on horn formation remains unclear at this stage. However, it seems likely that additional mechanisms explaining the biological effects on horn formation will be revealed by laboratory research in the future. Results from epidemiological studies of supplementation indicate that a supplement of 20 mg per day active biotin given continuously each day (this vitamin is water soluble) at all stages of production is effective at reducing lameness/foot lesions in cattle 4 - 6 months after starting supplementation. The amount of reduction will vary by herd but may be as high as 50 %. The current cost of biotin (July 2005) is such that it costs 3. 50 pound - 10. 00 pound to supplement a dairy cow for one year. Lameness is estimated to cost 145 pound per cow per year. Consequently, if supplementing a 100 cow dairy herd reduces lameness by 3 - 7 cows per year, biotin is a cost effective tool in the fight to reduce lameness. There is also evidence that biotin may improve milk yield in high yielding herds by approximately 2 kg per cow per day in early lactation; consequently it may also be worth considering that the cost of biotin supplementation may also be offset against the value of extra milk produced. However, biotin is not a cure all for the prevention of lameness, which has a multifactorial aetiology, and a focused programme for lameness reduction also needs to include a balanced diet, comfortable lying conditions, ease of rising, walking without fear to eat, to be milked, to loaf and to lying areas, high quality flooring where cattle can express their normal gait, successful social integration into the herd for heifers and returning dry cows, good management of transition cattle, and high standards of hygiene to minimise contact with faeces...|$|E
40|$|The dermal and {{epidermal}} {{structure of}} the coronet of 28 adult domestic horses was studied. Because several samples {{along the back of}} the hoof were taken it was possible to show the influence of the time of the year on the hoof horn quality. The keratinized epidermis can be divided into an inner, middle and outer zone because of structural and histochemical differences. The middle and the outer zone show several similarities. The horn of the coronet undergoes a hard keratinization. Above the corial papillae, the living epidermis forms horn tubules and intertubular horn. The inner zone consists of round horn tubules with an usually wide and empty marrow. It shows a lower horn hardness and a higher elasticity than the middle and outer zone of the coronet which possess oval horn tubules. The marrow is narrow and filled with partly intact, partly cracked horn cells. Only the horn tubules near the surface of the hoof stay intact, the medullary cells do not decay in any area of the hoof. The transmission electron microscopical investigation shows that the cells of the horn tubules and the intertubular horn have a spongious cytoarchitecture and mostly an enlarged intercellular space. In contrast to this, the horn cells of the middle and outer coronet are solid and have a narrow intercellular space. In the electrophoratical studies it is shown that in the middle and outer area of the coronet appear two additional cytokeratins in contrast to the inner zone, while the intermediate filament proteins show now differences in the three areas. Because of the horn structure, the cytoarchitecture, the histometric studies and the results of the hardness and moisture content measurements, it can be concluded that the horn of the inner coronet has to absorb the proximodistal forces that act on the hoof during the motion of the horse. The function of the middle and outer coronet is the protection of the sensitive structures in the inner areas of the hoof against lateral forces. Horn that is probably produced in the summer has a decreased horn quality in comparison to horn that is probably produced in the winter because the intercellular space is mostly enlarged and incompletely filled with intercellular <b>cementing</b> <b>substance.</b> The histometrical studies pointed out that it showed less horn tubules per mm&sup 2; hoof horn. These tubules have an enlarged marrow, which- {{in the same way as}} an incompletely filled intercellular space- is a predilection site for the entrance of microbial and chemical invasion. A reduction of horn quality is also caused by the natural process of ageing. In contrast to the Przewalski horse (PATAN, 2001) the intercellular space of the domestic horse is wider and the gel-electrophoresis shows differences in the appearence of proteins. In histometrical studies the domestic horse also shows discrepancies in comparison to the Przewalski horse. Furthermore, the domestic horse possesses a lower horn hardness in the outer coronet than the Przewalski horse. The shown seasonal differences are not so distinct in the domestic horse compared to the Przewalski horse, which can be explained by the different conditions of housing and the influence of domestication. Additional investigations should analyze whether domestic horses which are accomodated under conditions of semi-reservate also show distinct histometrical and mechanical-physical results and a marked seasonal rhythm of the horn production, horn abrasion and horn quality like the Przewalski horses...|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} methods {{available}} {{for the purpose of}} differentiating fungal species. Histological examination allows for the exploitation of unique morphological features of M. mycetomatis, including but not limited to the unique <b>cement</b> like <b>substance</b> and multi-lobed morphology of the grains. Molecular analysis allows for a more sensitive technique to discriminate between morphologically similar species. An internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) digestion or gene sequencing to obtain the results. The highly variable nature of the ITS sequence between species not only allows for diagnosis, but also the identification of M. mycetomatis in soil samples. ITS has also been cited as the recommended method for isolation of M. mycetomatis. Additionally, molecular analysis lead to the determination that M. mycetomatis did not share a common ancestor with M. grisea, and belonged in the Sordariales class.|$|R
40|$|Over {{one hundred}} years ago Berzelius {{investigated}} the chemistry of the lens. However, under the circumstances {{it is not surprising that}} the lens was not studied quantitatively until over sixty years later. From 1900 until the present time the chemical and physiological data of the lens, particularly relating to cataract, have accumulated rapidly. Chief interest has recently turned to the study of the sequence of events that takes place in the lens during growth and senescence, and during pathological changes. The lens as a tissue is unusually interesting biologically and chemically: first, because it is suspended in the intraocular fluid like a culture of tissue in a nutritive medium; secondly, because it is avascular; and thirdly, because it may be easily investigated, as no other tissue can, by optical methods. Nevertheless, in spite of the favorable conditions for study, and in spite of innumerable isolated facts, knowledge concerning the lens is comparatively incomplete. Growth. The manner of the growth of the lens plays a great part in the understanding of its chemistry. The cavity of the embryonic lens vesicle, which is formed from the invaginated ectoderm, is filled by the sagittal prolongation of the posterior cells of the cavity. These fibers traverse the lens and form a nucleus of the lens. The remaining single layer of anterior cells of the cavity later forms the lens epithelium beneath the anterior capsule. By the constant process of gradual elongation from meridional rows of cells, the lenticular epithelium grows out peripherally into lens fibers arranged in concentric radiating lamellae extending from the anterior to the posterior septa. The innermost fibers are the oldest, and the outermost the youngest. The nuclei in the oldest fibers and in the lenticular nucleus disappear. The growth of the outer layers of the lenticular fibers continues into advanced life. In contrast to other epithelial structures, the oldest of which are exfoliated, the oldest fibers of the lens are condensed, and form the nucleus. The fibers of the lens are long hexagonal ribbons, the serrated edges of which are held together by a <b>cement</b> <b>substance...</b>|$|R
