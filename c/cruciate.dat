5|$|Fowler's {{performance}} in the 1997–98 football season was marred by an anterior <b>cruciate</b> (knee) ligament injury that {{kept him out of}} action for half the season and caused him to miss the 1998 World Cup. During this period of injury, fellow Liverpool striker, Michael Owen rose to prominence, making his debut in 1997. Owen established himself in the Liverpool team in Fowler's absence.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} in the Chicago {{metropolitan}} area and was raised there until the age of 13, at which point he moved to live with an uncle in North Carolina so that he could live a better life.

Baroš returned to the Czech Republic for treatment in January 2014.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 2000, {{during a}} game with Manchester City, he {{ruptured}} his anterior <b>cruciate</b> ligaments, keeping him out of action for several months. He was awarded a testimonial against Manchester City in August 2000, but got into a dispute with the club over the financial arrangements. He then left the club in November 2000, and issued employment tribunal proceedings for unfair dismissal.|$|E
5|$|With Warnock {{replacing}} Ternent as Bury {{manager and}} Ternent {{moving on to}} manage Burnley, this signalled a return to Turf Moor for Swan. Ternent moved Swan back into defence, but could only give him eleven starts and six substitute appearances following a combination of suspensions, illness and injury. A collision with Wycombe Wanderers' Jason Cousins on 20 February 1999 spelt {{the beginning of the}} end for Swan's career, as the result of a scan showed he had snapped the <b>cruciate</b> ligament in his right knee.|$|E
5|$|After {{beginning}} the 1998–99 {{season on the}} Canucks' top line, Bertuzzi was limited to 32 games due to injuries, {{the first of which}} was a fractured tibia. He suffered the injury on November 1, 1998, after a shot by teammate Mattias Öhlund hit him in the leg. His season was later ended with a torn anterior <b>cruciate</b> ligament (ACL) in his left knee, suffered during a game on March 5, 1999. He recorded 8 goals and 16 points in 1998–99. In the off-season, Bertuzzi became a restricted free agent and was re-signed by the Canucks to a two-year contract in September 1999. The deal was reported by The Vancouver Sun to be worth a little over $2 million.|$|E
5|$|As {{a sophomore}} in 2006, Rapinoe {{was among the}} nation's leading scorers with ten goals and two assists in eleven matches. During a match against Washington State University on October 5, she {{suffered}} her first season-ending anterior <b>cruciate</b> ligament (ACL) injury. Despite her injury, {{she was one of}} three Portland players in the program's history, including Tiffeny Milbrett and Shannon MacMillan, to score 25 goals and 15 assists in 2 seasons. In 2007, Rapinoe suffered her second season-ending ACL injury two games into the season. She was granted a medical hardship waiver by the NCAA, but did not use it.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea centre back Frank Sinclair {{and left}} back Graeme Le Saux were both sidelined {{for the final}} due to their calf injuries, causing player-manager Vialli to swap them with Michael Duberry, and Danny Granville, who had {{recovered}} from an abscess pain. Central midfielder Poyet was {{also included in the}} starting line-up to join captain Dennis Wise, after returning from a damaged <b>cruciate</b> ligament. Together with forward and lead goalscorer Vialli, Flo began in the attack, instead of Zola, who was named as a substitute, despite making an improvement from his damaged groin, sustained in a league fixture against Liverpool in April.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009 season, Virginia Tech was 28th {{nationally in}} scoring offense (number of points scored) and 55th in total offense. Most of the Hokies' success {{came on the}} ground: Tech was 16th nationally in rushing offense but 98th in passing offense. A large reason for Virginia Tech's {{offensive}} success was running back Ryan Williams, who broke Virginia Tech's single-season rushing record that year. Entering the Chick-fil-A Bowl, he had 1,538 yards, only 110 short of the record. Tech running back Darren Evans, who tore his left anterior <b>cruciate</b> ligament before the season began, was held out of the Chick-fil-A Bowl, even though his recovery had progressed {{to the point that}} he could have participated.|$|E
5|$|During {{the end of}} {{his final}} season at Vicenza, Baggio {{shattered}} both the anterior <b>cruciate</b> ligament (ACL) and the meniscus of his right knee while playing against Rimini on 5 May 1985, while attempting a slide tackle. The injury occurred two days before his official transfer deal to Fiorentina had been finalised, and it seriously threatened his career, at age 18. Although several team doctors feared he would not play again, Fiorentina retained their faith in him, agreeing to commit to the transfer as well as fund the required surgery, one of many reasons for Baggio's attachment to the club.|$|E
5|$|Entering {{his senior}} year, many scouts had Croyle ranked {{as high as}} the #2 quarterback in the country behind Joe Mauer, who would go on to play Major League Baseball. However, Croyle's high school career ended {{abruptly}} in the first game of his senior season against Glencoe High School after a hit by an opposing player tore Croyle's anterior <b>cruciate</b> ligament (ACL), causing him to miss the remainder of his senior year. When he graduated, he held the Alabama state records for career passing yards with 9,323, and career touchdowns with 105. He set marks for most passing yards in a single season, passing yards in a single game, touchdown passes in a season, and touchdown passes in a game.|$|E
5|$|He rejoined former club Durham City, newly {{promoted}} {{into the}} Northern Premier League Premier Division, in June 2009 along with Brayson. After Durham's financial problems led to all players being {{made available for}} transfer, he signed for Northern League Division One club Bedlington Terriers in September 2009, making a winning debut in the first qualifying round of the FA Vase. He was later appointed captain. He suffered a <b>cruciate</b> ligament injury before signing for Newcastle Benfield of the Northern League Division One in 2013. He returned to playing after a year out injured, and signed for Northern League Division One club Ashington on 3 August 2014.|$|E
5|$|His {{first season}} with Blackburn was mixed – he missed half of it through injury after {{snapping}} his right anterior <b>cruciate</b> ligament in a match against Leeds United in December 1992, but scored a prolific 16 goals in the 21 games in which he did feature. Shearer also became a regular in the England team this season and scored his second international goal; it came in a 4–0 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier win over Turkey in November. The season ended sourly, however, as Shearer was forced to miss January through to May due to injury and England's World Cup qualification chances were hit by a run of poor form.|$|E
5|$|In late December 2009, WWE Divas Champion Melina tore her {{anterior}} <b>cruciate</b> ligament, and {{was forced}} to vacate the championship. As a result, it was announced in January 2010 that a single-elimination tournament would be held to determine a new champion. The tournament began on the January 4 episode of Raw, when Maryse advanced to the semi-finals by defeating Brie Bella. She was followed into the semi-finals by Gail Kim, Alicia Fox, and Eve, who defeated Jillian Hall, Kelly Kelly, and Katie Lea Burchill respectively. In the semi-finals, Maryse defeated Eve and Kim defeated Fox. It was then announced on the February 8 episode of Raw that Maryse and Kim would face one another in the final at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{game of the}} season, Virginia Tech {{defeated}} Connecticut, 5210, but lost starting running back Lee Suggs, who tore his anterior <b>cruciate</b> ligament during the game. Suggs' absence {{did not affect the}} Hokies in their next game, as they defeated Western Michigan, 310. The Hokies continued their winning streak through the first Virginia Tech games of the season, heading into a conference contest against Syracuse with a 60 record and ranked No. 5 in the country. On October 27, however, Syracuse ended Tech's 16-game home winning streak by defeating the Hokies, 2214, in Lane Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Kahn was {{initially}} {{called for the}} German national team as a late back-up for the 1994 FIFA World Cup; however {{he made his first}} international appearance on 23 June 1995 in a 2–1 victory against Switzerland, two months after recovering from his <b>cruciate</b> ligament injury. Along with Oliver Reck, Kahn was a reserve keeper of the squad, which won the 1996 UEFA European Football Championship in England. He spent the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France on the bench, and it was not until Andreas Köpke announced his retirement {{at the end of the}} tournament that Kahn became the starting goalkeeper. Two years after the 2000 UEFA European Football Championship, in which defending champions Germany made an embarrassing exit in the group stage, Kahn received the squad's captaincy, succeeding the striker Oliver Bierhoff.|$|E
5|$|Kahn's {{performance}} for Karlsruher SC prompted Bayern Munich to express interest in acquiring him. The team signed {{him as a}} replacement for Raimond Aumann {{at the beginning of the}} 1994–95 season, for the at that time record fee of DM4.6million (€2.385million) for his position, and was established as Bayern’s starting goalkeeper. Although suffering a rupture of his <b>cruciate</b> ligament, which kept him off the field for almost six months, Kahn made his debut match for the German national team two months after his return. Bayern defeated Bordeaux 3–1 in the 1996 UEFA Cup Final. In the 1996–97 Bundesliga season, Kahn achieved his first German championship with Bayern Munich, the German League Cup, and was named German Goalkeeper of the Year for the second time in his career (the first in 1994).|$|E
5|$|On October 29, 2014, Parker {{made his}} NBA {{debut in the}} Bucks' season opener against the Charlotte Hornets. In just under 37 minutes of action as a starter, he {{recorded}} 8 points, 4 rebounds, 1 assist, and 1 steal in a 108–106 overtime loss. Two nights later in his first home game, he posted a double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds against the Philadelphia 76ers. On November 19, he posted a season-high 23 points in a triple-overtime win over the Brooklyn Nets. Parker {{was selected as the}} October/November Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month. On December 15, Parker suffered a season-ending injury by tearing his anterior <b>cruciate</b> ligament (ACL) against the Phoenix Suns.|$|E
5|$|Overmars {{was born}} in Emst and was passionate about {{football}} at an early age. He began his playing career at SV Epe before joining Go Ahead Eagles' youth team in 1987. He secured {{a place in the}} first team by the 1990–91 season, but joined Willem II in time for the following season. His stay at the club was short; after 31 appearances he signed for Ajax in 1992. He established himself as a key member of the team that won three Eredivisie titles from between 1994 and 1996 and the UEFA Champions League in 1995. In December 1995, Overmars sustained a <b>cruciate</b> ligament injury which ruled him out of playing for eight months.|$|E
5|$|A {{product of}} Manchester United's youth academy, Campbell progressed to their first-team in the 2006–07 season. He made four {{appearances}} without scoring in his {{tenure at the}} club. He had a loan spell at Belgian club Royal Antwerp, where he scored 24 goals in 38 appearances. He also had loan periods with Hull City and Tottenham Hotspur, where he scored 15 goals in 37 matches and three goals in 22 appearances respectively. He signed for Sunderland {{at the beginning of}} the 2009–10 season for £3.5million. His involvement at Sunderland was limited due to an anterior <b>cruciate</b> ligament injury he sustained in his second season at the club, as well as a recurrence of the same problem later in the season. He moved to Cardiff in January 2013 on a three-and-a-half-year deal, and then Crystal Palace 18 months later.|$|E
5|$|After Denard Robinson {{left for}} the NFL, sophomore Russell Bellomy, the only {{scholarship}} quarterback on the roster other than Devin Gardner, endured a season-ending anterior <b>cruciate</b> ligament injury. The injury left the team without a healthy backup who had ever taken an official snap. True freshman Morris competed with redshirt freshman walk-on Brian Cleary for the backup role. On August 22, 2013 as a true freshman, Morris was named backup quarterback to redshirt junior Gardner. He made his debut for the 2013 team in the season opener against Central Michigan. Passing for 59 yards on 4-for-6 passing, {{he was one of}} 11 true freshmen to play in the game for Michigan. Morris also played in the Michigan–Michigan State football rivalry on November 2 against the 2013 Michigan State Spartans, completing only one pass (on three attempts) for six yards. Gardner suffered a turf toe injury prior to the 2013 team's 2013 Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl against Kansas State. With Gardner held out of practices, Morris got extensive work. Morris started in place of Gardner in the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl, compiling 196 yards on 2438 passing.|$|E
5|$|After Johnson scored {{just three}} goals {{in his first}} 24 {{appearances}} of the 2001–02 season, he fell out of favour with new manager Paul Hart, and from February to April 2002, {{in order to reduce}} the club's heavy wage bill, he was allowed to go on loan to fellow First Division clubs Sheffield Wednesday (for whom he scored twice in seven appearances) and Burnley (five goals in eight appearances). Burnley had agreed to pay £120,000 to sign Johnson on a permanent basis at the end of the season, but the transfer ultimately fell through. Upon his return to Nottingham Forest for the 2002–03 season, Johnson appeared to have found his form again that had made him such a success at Ipswich, scoring 29 goals in 47 appearances in all competitions as Nottingham Forest reached the play-offs. In February 2003, it was discovered that Johnson had been playing with a torn posterior <b>cruciate</b> ligament, and it was expected that his recovery would rule him out for up to six weeks; however, he was able to make a speedy return and was back in action against Grimsby two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|Born in Preston, {{he began}} playing {{football}} {{at a young}} age, taking inspiration from his father who played semi-professionally. Carlisle represented his home county of Lancashire at youth level. The start of his professional career was his Football League debut for Blackpool in September 1997. He moved to Queens Park Rangers in May 2000. In the same year, Carlisle won three caps for the England under-21 national team. He missed a number of matches for Queens Park Rangers due to a posterior <b>cruciate</b> ligament injury which at one stage led doctors to believe that his career was over. He then missed one month of the 2003–04 season because of an alcohol-related problem, and left Queens Park Rangers {{at the end of}} that season. In the summer of 2004, he joined Leeds United on a free transfer.|$|E
5|$|Coulson joined newly {{promoted}} League Two club York City on {{a two-year}} contract on 29 June 2012. He scored on his debut with a long-range strike away to League One team Doncaster Rovers in the League Cup first round to give York a 1–0 lead, with the match finishing 1–1 after extra time. Coulson missed York's first penalty {{in the ensuing}} penalty shoot-out, which the team lost 4–2. He then played in York's first Football League fixture since their promotion, a 3–1 defeat at home to Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012. After sustaining a <b>cruciate</b> ligament injury during York's away match against Accrington on 23 October 2012, Coulson {{was expected to be}} out for the rest of 2012–13. However, he made his return as a 73rd-minute substitute in York's 0–0 draw away to Bristol Rovers on 30 March 2013. He finished the season with 21 appearances and five goals.|$|E
