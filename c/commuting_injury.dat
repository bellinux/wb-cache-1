40|$|AimsTo {{investigate}} if {{diabetes is}} associated with a higher risk of occupational (workplace or <b>commuting)</b> <b>injury.</b> MethodsMedication data from the Finnish Prescription Register were used to identify diabetes cases in 2004 in a large employee cohort (the Finnish Public Sector study). These data were linked to injury records obtained from the Federation of Accident Insurance Institutions. A total of 1020 diabetes cases (median age 52 years, range 20 to 65 years; 66 % women) and their 5234 age- and sex-matched controls were followed up until 2011. Sex-stratified Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for age, occupational status, obesity and health behaviours, were applied. Because of the small number of men in the cohort, injury types and locations were only examined among women. ResultsDuring the median follow-up of 6. 7 years, 25 % of the participants with diabetes (n= 252) and 20 % of those without (n= 1051) experienced an occupational injury. The association between diabetes and injury was stronger in women than men (P= 0. 048). Diabetes was associated with a higher risk of workplace (hazard ratio 1. 37, 95 % CI 1. 11 to 1. 69) and commuting (hazard ratio 1. 36, 95 % CI 1. 03 to 1. 79) injury in women. With regard to different injury types and locations, diabetes was associated with bone fractures, dislocations, sprains and strains, and injuries to upper and lower extremities. In men, there was an association between insulin-treated diabetes and <b>commuting</b> <b>injury</b> (hazard ratio 3. 14, 95 % CI 1. 52 to 6. 49). ConclusionsDiabetes was associated with workplace and commuting injuries in women. Men with insulin-treated diabetes had a higher risk of commuting injuries...|$|E
40|$|Background Thoroughness {{in a given}} health {{information}} system {{is one of its}} most important quality indicators. In Spain, in ~ 30 % of serious occupational injuries, there is no information on the final outcome. Aim To assess underreporting of fatal occupational injuries in Catalonia. Methods All serious occupational <b>injuries</b> (excluding <b>commuting</b> <b>injuries)</b> reported in Catalonia (Spain) between 1994 and 1998 (n = 7330) were linked with data from the Catalonian Mortality Register, 117 deaths being identified during the year following the injury date. In order to assess whether death could or could not have been related to the prior occupational injury, two experts examined these cases independently. Results The experts concluded (κ = 0. 98) that 69 (59 %) of these deaths were probably related to occupational injuries; the vast majority (n = 65) occurred within 3 months of the injury. This represents an accumulated risk of dying of ~ 1 % for the total o...|$|R
40|$|With {{the number}} of deaths, <b>commute</b> time, and <b>injuries</b> {{constantly}} rising due to human driving errors, it’s {{time for a new}} transportation system, where humans are no longer involved in driving decisions and vehicles are the only machine that decide the actions of a vehicle. To accomplish a fully autonomous world, it’s important for vehicles to be able to communicate instantly and report their movements in order to reduce accidents. This paper discusses four approaches to vehicle to vehicle communication, as well as the underlying standards and technology that enable vehicles to accomplish communicating...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Transient {{exposure}} {{with acute}} effect {{has been shown}} to affect the risk of occupational injuries in various industrial settings and at the healthcare workplace. The objective of this study has been to identify transient exposures related to occupational injury risk in an Italian teaching hospital. Material and Methods: A case-crossover study was conducted among the employees of the University Hospital of Udine who reported an occupational <b>injury,</b> <b>commuting</b> accident, or incident involving biological risk in a 15 -month period in the years 2013 and 2014. The matched-pair interval approach was used to assess the role of acute sleep deprivation whereas the usual frequency approach was used for other 13 transient exposures. Results: Sleep hours were not associated with the risk of injuries whereas a significant risk increase was associated with fatigue, rush, distraction, emergency situations, teaching to or being taught by someone, non-compliant patients, bloody operative/work field, excess noise, complex procedures, and anger. Conclusions: We identified transient exposures that increased the risk of occupational injuries in an Italian teaching hospital, providing indications for interventions to increase workers' safety at the healthcare workplace...|$|R
