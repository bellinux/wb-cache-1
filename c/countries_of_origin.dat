40|$|A {{number of}} authors have argued, quite convincingly, {{that the current}} <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> rules are antiquated and should be change (Lloyd, 1993; Falvey and Reed, 1998; Ho, 1998). The main {{argument}} is that a single <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> does not fit the reality of global production in the modern world. The logical conclusion is therefore the replacement <b>of</b> a single <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (SCO) rule by a multiple <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (MCO) description.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine {{different}} preferences for brand name–country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> shaped in line with levels of conspicuous consumption tendency and to determine Turkish consumers’ preferences for brand name–country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> combinations in different product groups. The study was conducted in Eskisehir (Turkey) with a sample of 413 people chosen through convenience sampling. The study data were collected with a questionnaire and face-face-to interviews. The participants’ preferences for brand name-country <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> combinations were determined separately based on four different product groups(hedonic, utilitarian, durable and non-durable). The study showed that, for all the four product groups, the participants preferred the products with a Turkish brand name and Turkey as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> most, followed by the products with a French brand name and France as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> This finding suggests that, with respect to the four product groups in the study, Turkish consumers preferred domestic products over foreign products. Also, the participants who preferred French brand name-France as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the hedonic product, French brand name-Turkey as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the utilitarian product, French brand name-Turkey as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the durable product and French brand name-France as the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> for the non-durable product were found to have highest tendency of conspicuous consumption in the corresponding product groups.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{panorama}} of international markets reflects an extremely competitive market, with many available products that stand out {{due to their}} quality, durability and diversification. Consequently, the process of evaluating products is increasingly more complex, due {{to the number of}} factors taken into account in the process. The <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> effect is one of those factors. The image <b>of</b> a <b>country</b> is directly associated with the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> effect and it can be shaped by the behaviour and habits of its society, the performance of its business sectors on international markets, and by the perceptions of foreigners about the country. A positive country image will reflect a positive impact <b>of</b> the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> effect, while a negative country image will reflect a negative impact <b>of</b> the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> effect.
