5000|$|In {{case of a}} full melt-down, {{the fuel}} would most likely {{end up on the}} {{concrete}} floor of the primary containment building. Concrete can withstand a great deal of heat, so the thick flat concrete floor in the primary containment will often be sufficient protection against the so-called China Syndrome. The Chernobyl plant didn't have a containment building, but the core was eventually stopped by the concrete foundation. Due to concerns that the core would melt its way through the concrete, a [...] "core catching device" [...] was invented, and a mine was quickly dug under the plant with the intention to install such a device. The device contains a quantity of metal designed to melt, diluting the corium and increasing its heat conductivity; the diluted metallic mass could then be cooled by water circulating in the floor. Today, all new Russian-designed reactors are equipped with <b>core-catchers</b> {{in the bottom of the}} containment building.|$|R
40|$|Cores {{from four}} Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites were {{examined}} for planktonic foraminifers. One sample per core (from <b>core-catchers</b> in Holes 806 B and 807 B and from Section 4 in Holes 847 B and 852 B) was examined through the interval representing the last 5. 8 m. y. Sites 806 (0 ° 19. 1 'N; 159 ° 21. 7 'E) and 847 (0 o 12. 1 'N; 95 ° 19. 2 'W) are beneath the equatorial divergence zone. Sites 807 (3 ° 36. 4 'N; 156 ° 37. 5 'E) and 852 (5 ° 19. 6 'N; 110 ° 4. 6 'W) are located {{north of the}} equator in the convergence zone created by {{the interaction of the}} westward-flowing South Equatorial Current (SEC) and the eastward-flowing North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC). Specimens were identified to species and then grouped according to depth habitat and trophic level. Species richness and diversity were also calculated. Tropical neogloboquadrinids have been more abundant in the eastern than in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean throughout the last 5. 8 m. y. During the mid-Pliocene (3. 8 - 3. 2 Ma), their abundance increased at all sites, while during the Pleistocene (after ~ 1. 6 Ma), they expanded in the east and declined in the west. This suggests an increase in surface-water productivity across the Pacific Ocean during the closing of the Central American seaway and an exacerbation of the productivity asymmetry between the eastern and western equatorial regions during the Pleistocene. This faunal evidence agrees with eolian grain-size data (Hovan, 1995) and diatom flux data (Iwai, this volume), which suggest increases in tradewind strength in the eastern equatorial Pacific that centered around 3. 5 and 0. 5 Ma. The present longitudinal zonation of thermocline dwelling species, a response to the piling of warm surface water in the western equatorial region of the Pacific, seems to have developed after 2. 4 Ma, not directly after the closing of the Panama seaway (3. 2 Ma). Apparently, after 2. 4 Ma, the piling warm water in the west overwhelmed the upwelling of nutrients into the photic zone in that region, creating the Oceanographic asymmetry that exists in the modern tropical Pacific and is reflected in the microfossil record. In the upper Miocene and lower Pliocene sediments, the ratio of thermocline-dwelling species to mixed-layer dwellers is 60 %: 40 %. During the mid-Pliocene, the western sites became 40 % thermocline and 60 % mixed-layer dwellers. Subsequent to - 2. 4 Ma, the asymmetry increased to 20 %: 80 % in the west and the reverse in the east. This documents the gradual thickening of the warm-water layer piled up in the western tropical Pacific over the last 5. 8 m. y. and reveals two "steps" in the biotic trend that can be associated with specific events in the physical environment...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{question}} of the transient interface conditions in various severe accident situations, involving multicomponent and multi-phase material mixtures has until now remained largely unresolved. The interface temperature controls melt temperature and transient heat-flux distribution. The present paper proposes {{a new approach to}} the transient interface temperature, drawing on the numerous past efforts. A single relation is proposed which applies to various severe accident situations: (i) thermal-hydraulic steady state for in-vessel retention (IVR); (ii) transient solidification; (iii) transient concrete ablation (MCCI); and (iv) refractory material (ceramic) ablation (<b>core-catcher</b> retention, liner design). This approach yields the following important conclusions: - When a thermal-hydraulic steady state can be reached (external cooling, in case of IVR and melt stabilization in an externally cooled <b>core-catcher),</b> the melt-solid interface temperature tends towards the liquidus temperature corresponding to the melt composition. - During the ablation transient: the interface temperature is lower than the melt liquidus temperature if the wall-melting temperature is less than the melt liquidus temperature (MCCI), the interface temperature is higher than the melt liquidus temperature if the melting temperature of the wall exceeds the melt liquidus (oxidic corium-refractory ceramic interaction). The new interface model also suggests that simultaneous ablation of two similar walls (for instance: two concrete walls) may be subject to instabilities which can potentially result in complete arrest of the ablation of one of the walls. In the case of simultaneous ablation of two walls of different nature, the wall with the lowest melting temperature is preferentially ablated during the transient phase...|$|E
40|$|Neogene {{calcareous}} sediments {{were recovered}} at 11 sites along two north-south transects {{in the eastern}} equatorial Pacific Ocean during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 138. An overview of planktonic foraminifer distribution in these sediments was presented in Mayer, Pisias, Janecek, et al. (1992) based on a preliminary examination of <b>core-catcher</b> samples. In general, the preservation state of the foraminifers is poor {{throughout most of the}} sedimentary sequences, making this microfossil group here of much less value for biostratigraphy than other microfossil groups. Pliocene-Pleistocene planktonic foraminifers from several sites have been analyzed in great detail for their oxygen and carbon isotope composition in various high-resolution studies (Farrell et al., this volume; Mix et al., this volume; Ravello et al., this volume; Shackleton et al., this volume). Planktonic foraminiferal datums of biostratigraphic value have been identified in several of these studies.

40|$|Trigger weight (TWC) and piston (PC) cores {{obtained}} from {{surveys of the}} three sites drilled during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 105 were studied in detail for benthic foraminiferal assemblages, total carbonate (all sites), planktonic foraminiferal abundances (Sites 645 and 647), and stable isotopes (Sites 646 and 647). These high-resolution data provide the link between modern environmental conditions represented by the sediment in the TWC and the uppermost cores of the ODP holes. This link provides essential control data for interpretating late Pleistocene paleoceanographic records from these core holes. At Site 645 in Baffin Bay, local correlation is difficult because the area is dominated by ice-rafted deposits and by debris flows and/or turbidite sedimentation. At the two Labrador Sea sites (646 and 647), the survey cores and uppermost ODP cores can be correlated. High-resolution data from the site survey cores also provide biostratigraphic data that refine the interpretations compiled from <b>core-catcher</b> samples at each ODP site...|$|E
40|$|To {{stabilize}} the molten core in a severe accident, the EPR relies on an ex-vessel strategy {{based on the}} provision of a dedicated water-cooled core catcher. In-vessel melt retention by outside cooling was dismissed {{because of the high}} power rating of the reactor and the related low margins for heat transfer. The EPR core catcher into which the melt spreads has a large surface, which increases the surface-to-volume ratio and makes the subsequent cooling of the melt effective. The core catcher is located in a dedicated compartment lateral to the pit. The connection between pit and spreading compartment is normally closed. In a severe accident the separating plug will be opened by the melt itself. Thanks to the related spatial separation, the <b>core-catcher</b> in the spreading room is safe from potentially critical loads related to the failure of the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). Conversely, unintentional flooding of the core catcher during power operation does not affect the safety of the plant. As a consequence of this uncoupling of the provisions for severe accident mitigation from operational components and systems, power operation and design-basis accident mitigation measures remain unaffected by the existence of the core catcher...|$|E
40|$|Benthic foraminifers {{were studied}} in upper Eocene to Recent <b>core-catcher</b> samples from DSDP Sites 573, 574, and 575. The sites {{are on a}} north-south {{transect}} from the equator to about 05 °N at about 133 °W, water depth 4300 to 4600 m. At Site 574 additional samples were used to study the Eocene/Oligocene boundary in detail. About 200 specimens were counted per sample. The fauna is highly diverse (about 50 to 70 species per sample) and is of low dominance. The diversity {{is not related to}} age or sub-bottom depth. Many species are cosmopolitan and probably have wide environmental tolerances. Fluctuations in frequency of some taxa (e. g., Nuttallides umbonifera, Epistominella exigua, and Uvigerina spp.) cannot be correlated from one site to another. Several common species (e. g. Oridorsalis umbonatus and Globocassidulina subglobosa) range from late Eocene to Recent. First and last appearances are generally difficult to define precisely because many species are rare. For some species these datums differ from one site to another, but several datum levels are within 1 m. y. at all sites. First and last appearances are most numerous in two intervals, the late Eocene to early Oligocene (about 32 to 37 Ma) and the early to middle Miocene (about 13 to 18. 5 Ma). Isotopic events occur within each of these periods of benthic faunal change, but the isotopic events have a shorter duration and start after the initiation of the changes in the fauna. Changes in deep-sea benthic faunal composition are not directly related to short-term oceanographic changes as expressed in isotopic records...|$|E
40|$|Neogene {{calcareous}} sediments {{were recovered}} at 12 {{sites in the}} western Indian Ocean (Table 1). Approximately 1000 10 -cm** 3 samples, at a sampling interval of about 1. 5 m, were collected from one hole at each site for planktonic foraminifer analysis. Samples were washed through a 63 -?m mesh sieve. Dried samples were weighted before and after washing to obtain the percentage of sand-size components, which are given in Table 2. The distribution of selected planktonic key species in each hole is reported in Tables 3 - 14, where the occurrence of a species in a sample is indicated with a cross (x) and a slash sign (/) indicates that this species is extremely rare or presents some taxonomic ambiguity. A visual estimate of the abundance of various components other than planktonic foraminifers is also given in Tables 3 - 14, with the abbreviations R (rare), F (few), C (common), and A (abundant). An estimate of the foraminiferal fauna preservation state is reported {{at the right of}} each table using a qualitative preservation scale as follows: G (good), M (moderately good), P (poor), and VP (very poor). Also reported are the abundances of planktonic foraminifer fragments and foraminifers embedded in a calcareous matrix, both of which are a function of the preservation state (the first reflecting the intensity of carbonate dissolution and the second, the occurrence of recrystallization). Table 15 summarizes the biostratigraphic zonal assignments.

40|$|This study {{outlines}} a prestressed reactor pressure vessel, with integrated core-catching device, whose principal design {{characteristics are}} essentially oriented {{to the requirements}} of a 1300 MW_e_ 1 Konvoi pressurised water reactor. On the one hand, this type of core meltdown is retained in a relatively limited volume, in the course of which a reaction with water entering from the outside is repressed. On the other hand the selection is permitted of a prestressed reactor pressure vessel which is far greater than the size of conventional steel pressure vessels and, in addition, avoids accident sequences deriving from the spontaneous integral failure of the steel pressure vessel (bursting). The special feature of prestressed vessels is the devolution of various subfunctions to the individual vessel components. By the separation into supporting, bearing and sealing functions, the individual components can be optimised according to their specific requirements. In none of the structural components and loading cases investigated have impermissible stress values been achieved or even exeeded. The tensile stresses in the vessel components lie markedly under those of conventional vessel and, as the stress calculation show, only occur in small ranges. The separation of the prestressed reactor pressure vessel from core retention device via a so-called grider which permits the retention device to be braced separately from the vessel. A changing of the vertical fissure geometry into a broad upper inflow fissure and a narrower bottom fissure favours heat dissipation in the assumed core meltdown accident, in which a separation into metallic and oxidic phases is to be pressumed. In none of the suggested core meltdown scenarios is the load-bearing capacity of the casting material of the internal <b>core-catcher</b> exceeded. (orig.)

40|$|International audienceThe present work {{addresses}} {{the question of}} corium ceramic interaction in a core catcher during a core-melt accident in a nuclear power plant. It provides an original insight into transient aspects concerning dissolution of refractory material by a volumetrically heated pool. An experiment with simulant material (LIVECERAM) is presented. Test results clearly show that dissolution of solid refractory material can occur in a non-eutectic melt at a temperature which {{is lower than the}} melting temperature of the refractory material. During the dissolution transient, the interface temperature rises above the liquidus temperature, corresponding to the instantaneous average composition of the melt pool. With constant power dissipation in the melt and external cooling of the <b>core-catcher,</b> a final steady-state situation is reached. Dissolution stops when the heat flux (delivered by the melt to the refractory) can be removed by conduction through the residual thickness of the ceramic, with T-interface = T-liquidus (calculated for the average composition of the final liquid pool). The final steady state corresponds to a uniform pool composition and uniform interface temperature distribution. Convection in the pool is governed by natural thermal convection and the heat flux distribution is therefore similar to what would be obtained for a single component pool. An interpretation of the experiment with two model-based approaches (OD and 1 D) is presented. The mass transfer kinetics between the interface and the bulk is controlled by a diffusion sublayer within the boundary layer. During the dissolution transient, the liquid composition at the interface is concentrated in the refractory species. During the transient, the interface temperature is equal to the liquidus temperature corresponding to the local and instantaneous composition of the liquid at the interface. Regarding the design of a protective layer made of refractory materials, we can answer the question of how much ceramic can be dissolved and its impact on melt temperature evolution during the dissolution process. It also impacts on subsequent corium solidification since the additional mass of dissolved ceramic leads to increased volume of the molten material, significantly increasing the time required for complete solidification. For the long term, ceramic material does not offer better confinement than a crust made of solidified corium. This work served as support to a generalisation of the model of transient evolution of interface temperature in various severe accident situations (Seiler and Combeau, 2014) ...|$|E
40|$|Diverse and well-preserved planktonic foraminifers were {{recovered}} from six sites (834 - 839) drilled in the Lau Basin. Planktonic faunas from the Tongan Platform sites varied {{from those of}} the Lau Basin sites by being less well preserved (Site 840) to being very poorly preserved and very sparse (Site 841); at Site 841 most samples were barren. All sites penetrated a volcaniclastic sequence in which thick ash beds were encountered; foraminifer populations within the ash beds were often very small, making it difficult to obtain biostratigraphic data. No hiatuses were encountered in the upper Miocene to Pleistocene sections of the Lau Basin, but a possible break occurs at Site 840 on the Tongan Platform. Site 834 penetrated through a Quaternary-Pliocene sequence overlying basaltic basement, and topmost Miocene (Zone N 17 B) sediments interbedded within the volcanic sequence. Site 835 penetrated into the lower Pliocene (Zones N 19 to N 19 - 20). Site 836 penetrated the shortest section, with Zone N 22 {Globorotalia (Truncorotalia) crassaformis hessi Subzone) directly overlying basalts. Site 837 penetrated into the basal part of Zone N 22 (Globigerinoides quadrilobatus fistulosus Subzone) overlying basalt. Site 838 failed to encounter basalts, with the oldest sediment being from Zone N 22 (Globigerinoides quadrilobatus fistulosus Subzone). Site 839, within the same basin as Site 838, located Zone N 22 (Globigerinoides quadrilobatus fistulosus Subzone) sediments directly overlying igneous basement. Site 840 penetrated into the upper Miocene Zone N 17 A without encountering any major unconformity. Site 841, studied mainly from <b>core-catcher</b> samples, penetrated a Quaternary to questionable upper Miocene sequence that was in fault contact with middle Miocene (Zones N 8 to N 9) sediments. For the Lau Basin sites, reworking was encountered only in Sites 834 and 835. Site 834 was drilled adjacent to the Lau Ridge, on which are developed numerous reef al and shallow-water environments, where erosional conditions could have been expected during sea-level lowstands. Site 835 was drilled in a narrow basin that has been remote from these erosional influences; slumping and erosion of material from the adjacent basin slopes appears to have been the source of the reworking. For the Tongan Platform sites, reworking was observed only in {{the lower part of the}} upper Miocene section at Site 841, where late Eocene larger foraminifers are present in conglomerates and grits. The presence of Globorotalia (Globorotalia) multicamerata and small specimens of Sphaeroidinellopsis spp. in the Pleistocene of Site 840 may indicate reworking, but this is not clear. Unit I, which marks a reduction in volcanic activity in the Lau Basin, ranges in age from the lower part of Zone N 22 (Globigerinoides quadrilobatus fistulosus Subzone) at Sites 834 and 835, to within Zone N 22 (Globorotalia crassaformis hessi Subzone) at Sites 836 to 838, and within the upper part of Zone N 22 (Bolliella praeadamsi Subzone) at Site 839. Units II and III are generally represented by thick to very thick ash beds, which generally contain low-diversity and often poorly preserved assemblages. Igneous sources seem to have remained important contributors of sediment up to the present day...|$|E
