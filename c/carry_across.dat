5|$|There {{are local}} names for winds {{associated}} with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust {{during the winter}} into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to <b>carry</b> <b>across</b> Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere {{for days at a}} time across the Persian Gulf states.|$|E
5|$|In 737, Asad {{launched}} a campaign into the principality of Khuttal, whose rulers had supported the Turgesh and Harith's rebellion. Asad was initially successful, but the Khuttalan regent, Ibn al-Sa'iji, called upon the Turgesh for aid. While the Muslim army was scattered pillaging, the Turgesh khagan Suluk brought his army, allegedly 50,000 strong, from his capital Tokmok into Khuttal within 17 days. Ibn al-Sa'iji, who tried to play both sides off against each other, informed Asad of the Turgesh expedition only shortly before its arrival. Asad had time enough to send ahead his heavy baggage train, laden with the plunder and captives from Khuttal, back south {{under the command of}} Ibrahim ibn Asim al-'Uqayli, accompanied by the contingent from the allied principality of al-Saghaniyan. Asad with the main Muslim army remained behind, but at the arrival of the Turgesh host, Asad's troops broke into a headlong flight for the Oxus, which they managed to reach just ahead of the Turgesh. The crossing of the river was a confused affair, as Asad ordered each of his soldiers to <b>carry</b> <b>across</b> one of the sheep the army had brought with it as provisions. In the end, the sheep had to be abandoned as the pursuing Turgesh attacked the Arab rearguard, composed of the Azdi and Tamimi tribal contingents, on the north bank. As the rear guard was thrown back, Asad's army hurried to cross the river in panic.|$|E
500|$|Vanbrugh and Congreve {{received}} Queen Anne's {{authority to}} form a Company of Comedians on 14 December 1704, and the theatre opened as the Queen's Theatre on 9 April 1705 with imported Italian singers in Gli amori d'Ergasto (The Loves of Ergasto), an opera by Jakob Greber, with an epilogue by Congreve. This was the first Italian opera performed in London. [...] The opera failed, and the season struggled on through May, with revivals of plays and operas. The first new play performed was The Conquest of Spain by Mary Pix. The theatre proved too large for actors' voices to <b>carry</b> <b>across</b> the auditorium, and the first season was a failure. Congreve departed, Vanbrugh bought out his other partners, and the actors reopened the Lincoln's Inn Fields' theatre in the summer. Although early productions combined spoken dialogue with incidental music, a taste was growing amongst the nobility for Italian opera, which was completely sung, and the theatre became devoted to opera. As he became progressively {{more involved in the}} construction of Blenheim Palace, Vanbrugh's management of the theatre became increasingly chaotic, showing [...] "numerous signs of confusion, inefficiency, missed opportunities, and bad judgement". On 7 May 1707, experiencing mounting losses and running costs, Vanbrugh was forced to sell a lease on the theatre for fourteen years to Owen Swiny at a considerable loss. In December of that year, the Lord Chamberlain's Office ordered that [...] "all Operas and other Musicall presentments be performed for the future only at Her Majesty's Theatre in the Hay Market" [...] and forbade the performance of further non-musical plays there.|$|E

2500|$|Multiplayer mode {{features}} thirteen different {{class of}} character, each {{with their own}} strengths and weaknesses, and each with {{a different set of}} weaponry. Classes available immediately are [...] "gunslinger", [...] "rifleman", [...] "miner", [...] "sniper", and [...] "native". Unlockable classes are [...] "scout", [...] "trapper", [...] "gunsmith", [...] "hombre", [...] "spy", [...] "officer", [...] "duelist", and [...] "veteran". Multiplayer games employ a [...] "bounty system" [...] for scoring - the more kills a player gets, the more his/her bounty increases, and hence the more points are awarded to any player that kills them. This bounty system is used in all game modes, on all maps and with all character classes. Money earned during multiplayer games can be used to unlock character classes or to upgrade the class currently being used within the game. Upgrades feature two levels; the first level cancels out the classes' weaknesses, the second increases the classes' strengths. If the player switches classes mid-game having already upgraded another class, their upgrades will not <b>carry</b> <b>across</b> to the new class. However, if they switch back to the previously upgraded class, their upgrades will remain. Upgrades, however, do not <b>carry</b> <b>across</b> to different games.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the expert}} witness is being {{walked through the}} evidence, he/she has {{to keep in mind}} that most people have no {{thorough}} knowledge of entomology, so the responses to the questions being asked and the explanations about the evidence have to be kept clear and concise and in a simplistic manner that informs and educates, not only the jurors, but the judge as well. [...] It is vital that the attorney has a thorough grasp on all the concepts that are being explored so that he/she knows which questions to ask to <b>carry</b> <b>across</b> his point. In the same manner, the responses to the questions being asked by the opposing side should be kept as precise as possible, so as not to given the opposing attorney any ammunition to discredit the findings in the cross-examination.|$|E
2500|$|In La Crosse, Wisconsin, a {{newspaper}} reviewer {{called it a}} [...] "masterpiece" [...] and the [...] "Biggest Spectacle in History of Motion Pictures," [...] surpassing even D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation:"The photoplay and the spoken drama will be united {{for the first time}} in ... the million dollar masterpiece of Thomas H. Ince ... 'Civilization' is an encyclopedia of the emotions. [...] It is inevitable to compare such a picture, epic in its scope, including battles and the upheaval of a nation, to a similar picture, Griffith's 'Birth of a Nation.' Ince has excelled his predecessor in the art of suggestion. In the vivid battle scenes of 'Civllization,' there are four suggestive flashes for every one Griffith gave us. The conception is classically correct. No theater could be conceived that would be adequate in space or speed of action to <b>carry</b> <b>across</b> to an audience what was conveyed in this film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Filled pauses {{consist of}} repetitions of syllables and words, {{reformulation}} or false starts where speakers rephrase their speech {{to fit the}} representation they best perceive, grammatical repairs, and partial repeats that often involve searching for the right words in one's lexicon to <b>carry</b> <b>across</b> an intended meaning. There are basically three distinct forms for filled pauses: (i) an elongated central vowel only; (ii) a nasal murmur only; and (iii) a central vowel followed by a nasal murmur. Although a schwa-like quality , {{appears to be the}} most commonly used, some speakers consistently using the neutral vowel [...] instead, and others use both vowels in the same sentence, depending {{on the quality of the}} previous word last vowel. Filled pauses vocalizations may be built around central vowels and speakers may differ in their preferences, but that they do not appear to behave as other words in the language. The lengthening of words ending in a coronal fricative, for instance, could be obtained by prolonging the entire rhyme and/or the fricative only. Most of the time, however, the neutral vowel [...] is appended to achieve the desired effect.|$|E
2500|$|The royal courts, {{fixed to}} meet in London by the Magna Carta 1215, {{accepted}} claims for [...] "trespass on the case" [...] (more like a tort today). A jury would be called, and no wager of law was needed, but some breach of the King's peace had to be alleged. Gradually, the courts allowed claims where {{there had been no}} real trouble, no tort with [...] "force of arms" [...] (vi et armis), but it was still necessary to put this in the pleading. For instance, in 1317 one Simon de Rattlesdene alleged he was sold a tun of wine that was contaminated with salt water and, quite fictitiously, this was said to be done [...] "with force and arms, namely with swords and bows and arrows". The Court of Chancery and the King's Bench slowly started to allow claims without the fictitious allegation of force and arms from around 1350. An action for simple breach of a covenant (a solemn promise) had required production of formal proof of the agreement with a seal. However, in The Humber Ferryman's case a claim was allowed, without any documentary evidence, against a ferryman who dropped a horse overboard that he was contracted to <b>carry</b> <b>across</b> the River Humber. Despite this liberalisation, in the 1200s a threshold of 40 shillings for a dispute's value had been created. Though its importance tapered away with inflation over the years, it foreclosed court access to most people. Moreover, freedom to contract was firmly suppressed among the peasantry. After the Black Death, the Statute of Labourers 1351 prevented any increase in workers' wages fuelling, among other things, the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.|$|E

6000|$|Among Burke's {{numerous}} works {{those on}} America, India and France are deservedly the most famous. Of his orations on American subjects {{a student of}} literature or history may profitably read [...] "On Taxation" [...] (1774) and [...] "On Conciliation" [...] (1775), in which Burke presents the Whig {{argument in favor of}} a liberal colonial policy. The Tory view of the same question was bluntly presented by Johnson in his essay [...] "Taxation No Tyranny"; while like a reverberation from America, powerful enough to <b>carry</b> <b>across</b> the Atlantic, came Thomas Paine's [...] "Common Sense," [...] which was a ringing plea for colonial independence.|$|E
6000|$|At the White House one day some gentlemen {{were present}} from the West, excited and troubled about the {{commissions}} and omissions of the Administration.

No, you would hold your breath as well as your tongue, and keep your hands off until he was safe over. The Government are carrying an immense weight. Untold treasures are in their hands. They are doing the very best they can. Don't badger them. Keep silence, and we'll get you safe across." ...|$|E
60|$|The boy nodded, and in {{a moment}} Mackintosh saw him <b>carry</b> <b>across</b> the yard a bowl of {{steaming}} soup. He got up lazily, went into the dining-room, and ate his dinner. Had it happened? The uncertainty was amusing and Mackintosh chuckled in the silence. The food did not seem so monotonous as usual, and even though there was Hamburger steak, the cook's invariable dish when his poor invention failed him, it tasted by some miracle succulent and spiced. After dinner he strolled over lazily to his bungalow to get a book. He liked the intense stillness, and now that the night had fallen the stars were blazing in the sky. He shouted for a lamp {{and in a}} moment the Chink pattered over on his bare feet, piercing the darkness with a ray of light. He put the lamp on the desk and noiselessly slipped out of the room. Mackintosh stood rooted to the floor, for there, half hidden by untidy papers, was his revolver. His heart throbbed painfully, and he broke into a sweat. It was done then.|$|E
