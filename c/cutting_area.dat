25|$|Thermoplastics are {{difficult}} to machine because they have poor thermal conductivity. This creates heat that builds up in the cutting zone, which degrades the tool life and locally melts the plastic. Once the plastic melts, it just flows around the cutting edge instead of being removed by it. Machinability can be improved by using high lubricity coolant and keeping the <b>cutting</b> <b>area</b> free of chip build up.|$|E
25|$|Final shaping {{was then}} {{applied to the}} usable cutting edge of the tool, again using fine removal of flakes. Some Acheulean tools were {{sharpened}} instead by the removal of a tranchet flake. This was struck from the lateral edge of the hand-axe close to the intended <b>cutting</b> <b>area,</b> resulting in the removal of a flake running along (parallel to) the blade of the axe to create a neat and very sharp working edge. This distinctive tranchet flake can be identified amongst flint-knapping debris at Acheulean sites.|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} made {{on behalf of}} SCA Skog Jämtlands förvaltning {{which is one of}} five {{administration}} units that SCA Skog consists of. The purpose of the study is to investigate which reduced expenses there are according to spatial concentration of <b>cutting</b> <b>areas.</b> By increasing the spatial concentration of <b>cutting</b> <b>areas</b> it will reduce the need of movements by trailer, also reduce the number of roads that you use during the activities. To be able to perform the study, access to a annual cuttings in nine years have been made available. From this volume new annual cuttings has been created but more concentrated. The two different results have been compared and the results show that concentration of <b>cutting</b> <b>areas</b> generates reduced need for trailer transports and less km road that has to be maintained. But then, if it´s practical viable can be discussed. With an industry that fast rearrange it´s need for raw material and a weather that quickly can change. This involves changes that rapidly can ruin the best of plans.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{understand}} {{the prevalence of}} polyneuropathy and correlations among the clinical manifestations, electrophysiological findings, and degree of exposure to carbon disulphide (CS 2) in workers {{who were exposed to}} variable concentrations of CS 2 in a viscose rayon factory. METHODS [...] All the 163 workers received a detailed physical and neurological evaluation. Fixed point air samples were analysed for CS 2. Nerve conduction velocity was studied in 26 workers with symptoms similar to neuropathy. RESULTS [...] Nine workers (53 %) with overt polyneuropathy from the fibre cutting department and 19 workers (13 %) with oligosymptoms similar to polyneuropathy from various jobs were noted. The fixed point air concentrations of CS 2 were 150 - 300 ppm in the <b>cutting</b> <b>areas</b> and 15 to 100 ppm in the spinning areas. The estimated eight hour time weighted averages in the fibre <b>cutting</b> <b>areas</b> were 40 - 67 ppm. The occurrence of polyneuropathy was generally correlated with the degree of exposure to CS 2. Nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) were significantly different in the overt polyneuropathy and subclinical polyneuropathy groups from the normal controls. The sensitive indicators for CS 2 polyneuropathy were distal latency, motor NCV, and amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials in sensory NCVs. CONCLUSION [...] The outbreak of polyneuropathy was attributed to higher concentrations of CS 2 in fibre <b>cutting</b> <b>areas.</b> Even in other jobs with relatively lower concentrations of CS 2, the hazard of subclinical polyneuropathy cannot be overlooked...|$|R
50|$|However, {{irregular}} {{stands of}} this type are definitely more difficult to manage—new methods and techniques had to be sought particularly {{for the establishment of}} inventories, as well as increment control and yield regulation. In Germany, for instance, {{since the beginning of the}} nineteenth century under the influence of G.L.

40|$|Twist drills are {{geometrical}} complex {{tools and}} thus various researchers have adopted different approaches for their simulation. The present thesis acknowledges the {{increasing use of}} modern CAD systems and subsequently using the API (Application Programming Interface) of a typical CAD system, drilling simulations are carried out. The developed DRILL 3 D software routine, creates, via specifying parameters, tool geometries, so that using different cutting conditions, realistic solid models are produced incorporating all the relevant data involved. The 3 D solid models of the undeformed chips coming from both <b>cutting</b> <b>areas</b> are segmented into smaller pieces, in order to calculate every primitive thrust force component involved with high accuracy. The resultant thrust force produced, is verified by adequate amount of experiments using a number of different tools, speeds and feed rates. The final data derived, consist of a platform for further direct simulations regarding the determination of tool wear, drilling optimizations etc. DRILL 3 D calculates the thrust force of both the <b>cutting</b> <b>areas</b> of the tool (main edges and chisel edge) simultaneously, which means that every simulation can substitute two separate lab experiments. Nevertheless, as the number of parameters involved is increasing, the amount of the necessary simulations becomes substantial. This is the reason that led to the combined use of the DRILL 3 D and the design of experiments methodology, which reduces to an impressive degree, the amount of the necessary digital experiments. ...|$|R
50|$|Clear <b>cutting</b> <b>areas</b> for even-aged timber {{management}} {{can also}} benefit many wildlife species. The abundance of coarse woody debris {{added to the}} forest floor is beneficial to salamander and snake species, while the release of understory shrubs provides an increase of berry-foraging opportunities for bear and songbirds. In general, the immature, grassy forest regenerated after a clear cut fulfills specific habitat requirements for many species that cannot be found in mature forests. In the boreal forest, for example, wildfire has been suppressed by humans, resulting in many overmature stands. Even aged timber management restores the successional cycle and allows early successional species to recolonize immature habitat.|$|R
5000|$|Chemical milling or {{industrial}} etching is the subtractive manufacturing process of using baths of temperature-regulated etching chemicals to remove material {{to create an}} object with the desired shape. [...] It is mostly used on metals, though other materials are increasingly important. It was developed from armor-decorating and printing etching processes developed during the Renaissance as alternatives to engraving on metal. The process essentially involves bathing the <b>cutting</b> <b>areas</b> in a corrosive chemical known as an etchant, which reacts with the material {{in the area to}} be cut and causes the solid material to be dissolved; inert substances known as maskants are used to protect specific areas of the material as resists.|$|R

50|$|The use {{of fluids}} in a {{grinding}} process is often necessary to cool and lubricate {{the wheel and}} workpiece as well as remove the chips produced in the grinding process. The most common grinding fluids are water-soluble chemical fluids, water-soluble oils, synthetic oils, and petroleum-based oils.
