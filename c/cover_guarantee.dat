THE LEGAL ACTION THE BANK CARRIES OUT WHEN THE INSURED VIOLATES THE GUARANTEE BANK AGREEMENT (A STUDY IN THE SURAKARTA MAIN BRANCH OF PT BANK NEGARA INDONESIA). Faculty of Law of Sebelas Maret University. This {{research}} aims to {{find out}} the procedure of giving bank the guarantee carried out by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia as well as the legal action carried out by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia when the insured violates the guarantee bank agreement. This writing belongs to an empirical law research that is descriptive in nature. The data type employed was primary and secondary data. The secondary data source included primary, secondary and tertiary data. Techniques of collecting data used were interview and library study. Technique of analyzing data used was an interactive model of analysis, in which the data collected would be then analyzed using 3 (three) stages: data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing. Considering the result of research and discussion, it can be concluded that firstly, the Procedure of giving bank guarantee in the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia can be divided into 2 (two) types: bank guarantee giving with full cover collateral and bank guarantee giving with non-full cover collateral. Guarantee bank with full cover collateral means that the collateral {{is in the form of}} account. Meanwhile the guarantee bank with non-full <b>cover</b> <b>guarantee</b> means it is guaranteed with the customer’s account and asset as included in the Guarantee Bank Publication Agreement (PPGB). The guarantee bank publication by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia governed in the Guidelines and Policy of Retail Market Credit has been consistent with the conditions of guarantee bank publication included in the Decree of Indonesian Bank Director Board Number 11 / 110 /Kep. /Dir/UPBB about the Collateral Giving by Bank and Collateral Giving by the Non-Bank financial institution as well as Bank of Indonesia’s Circular Number: SE 11 / 11 concerning the Collateral Giving by Bank and Collateral Giving by Non-Bank Financial Institution.

40|$|Miniaturisation and {{integration}} represent {{the biggest challenges}} in the biomedical devices of the last generation. Particularly blood oxygenators have been successfully used for the last decades as components of the heart-lung machines but still don’t offer in the traditional configuration an alternative for the middle and long-term treatment of the acute lung failure. Innovative systems with reduced blood contact surface, priming volume and number of components are developed {{with the aim of}} lower risk of infection, blood clotting and cell damage. In this context the possibility of blood oxygenation through membranes in the limited space within the vena cava in the venous system has been investigated for the last two decades. The limitations are of anatomical and physiological nature. The anatomy of the venous system makes the introduction of fibers in a defined configuration difficult and limits the implantable fiber surface. Moreover, flow resistance within the system should not disturb the physiology of the venous system. This work describes the conception, the development and the investigation of a high-integrated intravascular membrane oxygenator (HIMOX) which took place in the last years at the Helmholtz Institut for biomedical engineering at the RWTH Aachen. The system is aimed to provide the maximal performance without detrimental effect on the physiological functions. An innovative fiber configuration represents the core of the proposed concept. Compact flexible fiber bundles slide on a middle catheter and fit to the anatomy of the venous system. In the folded configuration the diameter of the system is reduced and implantation through a narrow peripheral vessel possible. The compression and the expansion of the fiber bundles lead to a filling of the space within the vena cava and to an increased fiber surface. Resulting cross flow fiber configuration results in enhanced blood mixing and thus increased gas exchange. The first test samples were manufactured {{in a wide range of}} construction parameters. The effect of the fiber configuration on the flow conditions was mathematical modelled and experimental evaluated. Further components of the system were developed under consideration of the anatomical and physiological conditions of the venous system. The integration of a micro-axial blood pump compensates for fiber resistance to blood flow. A deformable <b>cover</b> <b>guarantees</b> the separation between the blood within the system and the blood outside. This leads to physiological blood pressure in the organs and blood flow to the heart. The integration of the pump in a housing as well as the construction of a cover in form of a coated stent are presented. The gas supply to the bundles within the limited available space takes place partially serial, partially parallel. This makes a high gas flow with a reduced pressure drop possible. The realisation of this concept through slides and elastic components is described. In vitro as well as animal experiments with the first test samples lead to the first conclusions about the potential performance of the system and allow an outlook in the future of the project...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a sensor based coverage algorithm and {{an overview of}} a mobile robot sys-tem for demining. The algorithm is formulated in terms of critical points which are the points where the topology of an environment changes. We developed a provably complete coverage algo-rithm which makes a robot pass over all possible points of an unknown environment. Overview of The Coverage Algorithm Conventional path planning determines a path be-tween two points. This type of planning is suitable for guidance, pick and place operations etc [...] Applica-tions such as vacuum cleaning, floor scrubbing, area surveying, demining (Land & Choset 1998) and har-vesting (Ollis & Stentz 1996) require more than point to point planning. They require a coverage algorithm which determines a path that passes the robot over all possible points in an environment. In many scenarios, the robot may not know its en-vironment a priori, and thus a sensor based coverage algorithm is necessary. Sensor based coverage deter-mines a path for a robot such that it passes over all possible points in an unknown environment. Com-pleteness of such a coverage algorithm is of utmost importance. As an example, all possible points of a minefield should be <b>covered</b> to <b>guarantee</b> not to miss a single mine. Different types of coverage algorithms were devel-oped by several researchers.

The basis for conclusions drawn from this study is data derived from a questionnaire administered to a diverse population of 135 people, resulting in one hundred useable questionnaires. It was found {{that more than half of}} the respondents did experience problems with their new major household appliances. Although most consumers made an effort to remedy their dissatisfaction, principally by contacting-the store of purchase, one out of every four consumers seldom, or sometimes did so.

Also,there were consumers who either repaired defective appliances themselves, or who paid to have repairs made during the first year of purchase, when their appliances were fully <b>covered</b> by <b>guarantees.</b> Consumers wanted more information regarding consumer resources, and often felt that they did not take adequate advantage of existing consumer resources.

Solvency II has been postponed several times, but implementation is now scheduled for January 2016. Life insurance companies manage funds over a long time period, the return on assets {{and the development of}} size of the liabilities determine if they manage to fulfill the future liabilities. Life insurance companies distribute the return to shareholders and policyholders after a profit sharing model. Contracts with interest rate guarantee are a product that is challenging for life insurance companies.

The life insurance company must in a worst-case scenario <b>cover</b> the <b>guarantee</b> by taking from the equity.
