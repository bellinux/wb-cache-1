40|$|Horizontal {{directionality}} of {{ambient noise}} was measured at ranges up to 15 km from the south-eastern shore of Monterey Bay, California. Water depths at the sites ranged from 8 to 175 m. A steerable cardioid receiving pattern was formed using signals telemetered from dipole and omnidirectional hydrophones suspended from tethered buoys. With no nearby shipping, whenever the maximum of the <b>cardioid</b> <b>pattern</b> was {{directed toward the}} beach, noise levels in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 70 Hz were greater than those obtained when the maximum was directed seaward. This difference or anisotropy (seaward vs. shoreward), which depends on range from the beach, on frequency and on surf intensity, was 10 dB at 300 Hz at the 9 km site during very heavy surf. Surf beat was clearly audible when the cardioid maximum was steered shoreward at ranges as great as 2 km. During heavy surf, the omnidirectional ambient noise levels also increased significantly in the same frequency range at which the anisotropy is evident. The anisotropy effects diminish both in magnitude and in frequency range with lower wave height but are still observable during light surf. We have concluded that intense breaking surf can contribute significantly to ambient noise in fairly deep continental shelf waters.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{transmit}} energy in one direction, sonar flextensional transducers {{are combined into}} arrays of elements that are spaced a 1 / 4 wavelength apart. The directionality (front-to-back pressure ratio) is a modest of 6 dB. A single projector that is 1 / 3 wavelength in size and capable of developing unidirectional beams with front-to-back ratios greater than 20 dB that is independent of sound speed is described here. The directional Class VII “dogbone” flextensional is {{a modified version of}} an elliptical shaped Class IV flextensional having a concave shell rather than a convex one. The piezoelectric ceramic stack is a tri-laminar bar with two active sections separated by an inactive center section. By driving both sections of the stack in-phase, the shell is driven into omnidirectional radiation pattern. Driving each stack section 180 degrees out-phase causes a bending mode in the stack resulting in a dipole radiation pattern. By driving both sections using complex coefficients determined from the omnidirectional and dipole mode <b>patterns,</b> a <b>cardioid</b> directional radiation <b>pattern</b> is developed. <b>Cardioid</b> <b>patterns</b> are developed over an octave frequency band with a front-to-back pressure ratio of more than 50 dB.

40|$|In this {{continuation}} of our {{paper in the}} last conference proceedings 1, we consider further developments {{in the area of}} Impulse Radiating Antennas (IRAs). First, we consider definitions of gain in the time domain, which are important for optimizing the performance of IRAs. A reasonable definition of gain must be equally valid in transmission as in reception. Such a definition leads naturally to a transient radar equation, which we discuss. Next, we consider how to optimize the feed impedance in a reflector IRA. If we use our simple model of IRA performance, the gain of an IRA is always better at lower impedances. But this implies larger feeds with more aperture blockage. To resolve this, we refine our simple model to account for feed blockage. We also consider the radiation pattern of IRAs, and we provide simple calculations. Finally, we provide a sample experiment which confirms our theory of IRA operation. I. REVIEW OF IRA DESIGN By now there exists a considerable body of literature concerning the design of IRA’s 1 - 17.

40|$|User {{requirements}} {{for access to}} a diversified range of advanced wireless telecommunication services {{have resulted in a}} rapid technological push to develop novel antenna design solutions for future generation wireless communication systems These include Multi-Mode Multi-Band antennas, Multi-Function and MIMO. One promising technology to meet the future requirements is the reconfigurable antenna. A reconfigurable antenna can virtually or electronically change the shape and size of its antenna geometry by utilizing electronic circuits inside the antenna such that the antenna can be reconfigured to work in different operating bands or standards for various functions when necessary. In this thesis, four new and novel contributions to reconfigurable antennas are described. The first contribution is the reconfigurable antenna for a portable wireless communications device. Two novel reconfigurable antennas have been designed. The first design supports Quad-band GSM and UMTS (3 G) and the second design supports Quad-band GSM, UMTS (3 G), Bluetooth and WLAN. Different active switches are also implemented on the reconfigurable antennas and the performance is compared and investigated. The second contribution involves a novel method to enhance the isolation between two closely packed antennas operating at the same frequency. A design of a USB dongle MIMO antenna for 2. 4 GHz WLAN Band is presented. The third contribution is a practical design of a low cost reconfigurable Landsdorfer planar antenna array. The antenna array can have a 360 -degree coverage in azimuth and allows a wide variety of directive beams to be electronically selected while maintaining a simple structure, ease of manufacture and low cost with high efficiency. Finally, in the fourth contribution, a compact and low-cost direction finding antenna system is proposed. The uniqueness of this compact antenna design is that it can reconfigure either a <b>cardioid</b> <b>pattern</b> or a directional beam pattern in order to detect the incoming RF signal from the source...|$|E
40|$|The Deep Impact probe {{collided}} with 9 P Tempel 1 {{at an angle}} of about 30 ◦ from the horizontal. This impact angle produced an evolving ejecta flow field very similar to much smaller scale oblique-impact experiments in porous particulate targets in the laboratory. Similar features and phenomena include a decoupled vapor/dust plume at the earliest times, a pronounced downrange bias of the ejecta, an uprange “zone of avoidance ” (ZoA), heart-shaped ejecta ray system (<b>cardioid</b> <b>pattern),</b> and a conical (but asymmetric) ejecta curtain. Departures from nominal cratering evolution, however, provide clues {{on the nature of}} the impact target. These departures include: fainter than expected flash at first contact, delayed emergence of the self-luminous vapor/dust plume, uprange-directed plume, narrow early-time uprange ray followed by a late-stage uprange plume, persistence of ejecta asymmetries (and the uprange ZoA) throughout the approach sequence, emergence of a downrange ZoA at late times, detachment of uprange curved rays, very long lasting non-radial ejecta rays, and high-angle ejecta plume lasting over the entire encounter. The first second of crater formation most closely resembles the consequences of a highly porous target, while later evolution indicates that the target may be layered as well. Experiments also reveal that impacts into highly porous targets produce a vapor/dust plume directed back up the incoming trajectory. This uprange plume is attributed to cavitation within a narrow penetration funnel. The observed lateral expansion speed of the initial vapor plume downrange provides an estimate for the total vaporized mass equal to ∼ 5 mp (projectile masses) of water ice or 6 mp of CO 2. The downrange plume speed is consistent with the gas expansion added to the downrange horizontal component of the DI probe. Based on high-speed spectroscopy of experimental impacts, the observed delay in brightening of the DI plume may be the result of delayed condensatio...|$|E

50|$|The radio {{equipment}} carried on course must {{be capable of}} receiving the signal being transmitted by the five transmitters and useful for radio direction finding. This includes a radio receiver that can tune in the specific frequency of transmission being used for the event, an attenuator or variable gain control, and a directional antenna. Directional antennas are more sensitive to radio signals arriving from some directions than others. Most equipment designs integrate all three components into one handheld device. On the two meter band, the most common directional antennas used by competitors are two or three element Yagi antennas made from flexible steel tape. This kind of antennahas a <b>cardioid</b> receiving <b>pattern,</b> which means that it has one peak direction where the received signal will be the strongest, and a null direction, 180° from the peak, in which the received signal will be the weakest. Flexible steel tape enables the antenna elements to flex and not break when encountering vegetation in the forest. On the eighty meter band, two common receiver design approaches are to use either a small loop antenna or an even smaller loop antenna wound around a ferrite rod. These antennas have a bidirectional receiving pattern, with two peak directions 180° apart from one another and two null directions 180° apart from one another. The peak directions are 90° offset from the null directions. A small vertical antenna element can be combined with the loop or ferrite rod antenna to change the receiving <b>pattern</b> to a <b>cardioid</b> shape, but the resulting null in the cardioid is not as sensitive as the nulls in the bidirectional receiving pattern. A switch {{is often used to}} allow the competitor to select the bidirectional or <b>cardioid</b> <b>patterns</b> at any moment. ARDF receiver equipment is designed to be lightweight and easy to operate while the competitor is in motion as well as rugged enough to withstand use in areas of thick vegetation.|$|R
40|$|Performance {{impairments}} {{occur on}} C- and Ku-band satellite communications links because of severe tropospheric fading effects when the elevation {{angle of the}} ground station is very low (< 5 o). Two cases of satellite communications link impairment are discussed; the first is for data transmission from a high latitude ground station as found in NASA’s Earth Orbiting Satellite (EOS) program. The second is for data transmission from LEO/MEO satellites at all latitudes. Experimental data shows that deep fading of satellite communications signals because of severe tropospheric absorption is as much as 27 dB during the worst summer month between a high latitude station and a geosynchronous satellite. With this amount of deep fading, it would be extremely difficult to transmit low-BER data during the summer months. The mitigation techniques proposed consist of: (a) adaptive coding by {{using a combination of}} the Reed-Solomon code, convolutional code, and interleaving, and (b), for lower orbit LEO satellites, a shaped (depressed <b>cardioid)</b> antenna <b>pattern.</b> Using the same adaptive coding technique, the amount of contact time by ground stations at any latitude with LEO/MEO satellites could be increased substantially by enabling operation to very low elevation angles generally considered unusable.

5|$|To keep low {{frequency}} sound {{focused on the}} audience area {{and not on the}} stage, and to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the event space, a variety of techniques have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally omnidirectional radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model is {{developed for the}} prediction of noise radiated by an aerofoil with leading edge serration in a subsonic turbulent stream. The model makes use of the Fourier Expansion and Schwarzschild techniques in order to solve a set of coupled differential equations iteratively and express the far-field sound power spectral density {{in terms of the}} statistics of incoming turbulent upwash velocity. The model has shown that the primary noise reduction mechanism is due to the destructive interference of the scattered pressure induced by the leading edge serrations. It has also shown that in order to achieve significant sound reduction, the serration must satisfy two geometrical criteria related to the serration sharpness and hydrodynamic properties of the turbulence. A parametric study has been carried out and it is shown that serrations can reduce the overall sound pressure level at most radiation angles, particularly at downstream angles close to the aerofoil surface. The sound directivity results have also shown that the use of leading edge serration does not particularity change the dipolar pattern of the far-field noise at low frequencies, but it changes the <b>cardioid</b> directivity <b>pattern</b> associated with radiation from straight-edge scattering at high frequencies to a tilted dipolar pattern.

5000|$|An antenna {{may have}} more than one driven element, {{although}} the most common multielement antenna, the Yagi, usually has only one. For example, transmitting antennas for AM radio stations often consist of several mast radiators, each of which functions as a half-wave monopole driven element, to create a particular radiation pattern. A two-element array with the elements spaced a quarter wavelength apart has a distinct <b>cardioid</b> radiation <b>pattern</b> when the second element is driven with a source -90° out of phase relative to the first element. A log-periodic antenna (LPDA) consists of many dipole elements of decreasing length, all of which are driven. However because they are different lengths, only one of the many dipoles is resonant at a given frequency, so only one is driven at a time. The dipole that is driven depends on the frequency of the signal. Phased arrays may have hundreds of driven elements. Household multiband television antennas generally consist of a hybrid between a UHF Yagi with one driven dipole and a log-periodic for VHF behind that with alternating active elements. The driven elements between the UHF and VHF are then coupled and often matched for a 75 ohm coaxial downlead to the receiver.|$|R
5000|$|Proximity {{effect is}} a change in the {{frequency}} response of a directional pattern microphone that results in an emphasis on lower frequencies. It is caused by the use of ports to create directional polar pickup patterns, so omni-directional microphones do not exhibit the effect (it should be noted that this is not necessarily true of the [...] "omni" [...] pattern on multipattern condenser mics, which create the [...] "omni" [...] pattern by summing two back-to-back cardioid capsules, {{which may or may not}} share a common backplate.) Depending on the microphone design, proximity effect may result in a boost of up to 16 dB or more at lower frequencies, depending on the size of the microphone's diaphragm and the distance of the source.A ready (and common) example of proximity effect can be observed with cardioid dynamic vocal microphones (though it is not limited to this class of microphone) when the vocalist is very close to or even touching the mic with their lips. The effect is heard as a 'fattening up' of the voice. Many radio broadcast microphones are large diameter <b>cardioid</b> pickup <b>pattern</b> microphones, and radio announcers are often observed to employ proximity effect, adding a sense of gravitas and depth to the voice.

Polarity inversion can be implemented electronically, by reversing the wiring polarity, or by physically positioning the enclosure to face rearward. This method reduces forward output relative to a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of subwoofers, but can solve problems of unwanted low frequency energy coming into microphones on stage. Compared to the end-fire array, this method has less on-axis energy but more even pattern control throughout the audience, and more predictable cancellation rearward.
