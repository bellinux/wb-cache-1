The effects of polymer molecular weight, polymer composition and drug : polymer ratios on the particle size, flow properties, morphology, surface properties and release {{characteristics of the}} prepared captopril microparticles were examined. The anti-hypertensive effect of the selected CAP formulation in comparison with aqueous drug solution was also evaluated in vivo using hypertensive rats. The formulation containing drug : polymer blend ratio 1 : 1. 5 (1 : 1 low : high molecular weight CP), namely F 7, {{was chosen as the}} selected formulation with regard to the encapsulation efficiency (75. 1 %), flow properties (¼ 24, Carr index¼ 5 %, Hausner ratio¼ 1. 1,packing rate¼ 0. 535) and release characteristics. Initial burst effect was observed in the release profile of all examined formulations. DSC and SEM results indicated that the initial burst effect could be attributed to dissolution of CAP crystals present on the surface or embedded in the superficial layer of the matrix. The release kinetics of CAP from most microparticle formulations followed diffusion mechanism. After oral administration of the selected microparticle formulation (F 7) to hypertensive rats, systolic blood pressure decreased gradually over 24 h compared to reference drug solution.

These were then characterised by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contact angle evaluation. Subsequently, catalase (H 2 O 2 : H 2 O 2 oxireductase; EC 1. 11. 1. 6), alcohol oxidase (Alcohol: oxygen oxireductase; EC 1. 1. 3. 13) and glucose oxidase (â-D-Glucose: oxygen 1 -oxireductase; EC 1. 1. 3. 4) were covalently linked to these membranes. The catalytic activity and stability of these enzymes, when immobilised, were examined. The results obtained showed that the immobilisation ef®ciency and {{the stability of the}} coupled enzymes could be correlated with the studied properties of the supports. The cellulose acetate membrane which was prepared by evaporation gave the more active conjugate support-enzyme. Membranes prepared by the immersion technique were more crystalline and therefore less suitable for enzyme immobilisation.

With regard to waste management, CO 2 balance and the conservation of petrochemical resources, increasing efforts are being made to replace standard plastics with bio-based polymers.

40|$|The blend {{miscibility}} of <b>cellulose</b> <b>propionate</b> (CP) with poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone-co-methyl methacrylate) (P(VP-co-MMA)) was investigated. The {{degree of}} substitution (DS) of CP used ranged from 1. 6 to > 2. 9, and samples for the vinyl polymer component were prepared {{in a full}} range of VP:MMA compositions. Through DSC analysis and solid-state (13) C NMR and FT-IR measurements, we revealed that CPs of DS< 2. 7 were miscible with P(VP-co-MMA) s of VP≥~ 10 mol% on a scale within a few nanometers, in virtue of hydrogen-bonding interactions between CP-hydroxyls and VP-carbonyls. When the DS of CP exceeded 2. 7, the miscibility was restricted to the polymer pairs using P(VP-co-MMA) s of VP=ca. 10 - 40 mol%; the scale of mixing in the blends concerned was somewhat larger (ca. 5 - 20 nm), however. The appearance of such a "miscibility window" was interpretable as an effect of intramolecular repulsion in the copolymer component. Results of DMA and birefringence measurements indicated that the miscible blending of CP with the vinyl polymer invited synergistic improvements in thermomechanical and optical properties of the respective constituent polymers.

40|$|Cellulose ester {{derivatives}} having phosphoryl side-chains were synthesized by phosphorylation of {{two types of}} <b>cellulose</b> <b>propionate</b> (CP); {{the difference between the}} two CPs was whether the primary hydroxyl group at C 6 had been fully propionylated or not. Dimethyl phosphate, dimethyl thiophosphate, diethyl phosphate, or diethyl thiophosphate was introduced into the residual hydroxyl positions of the CPs. Chemical composition of the respective derivatives was characterized by elemental analysis and a combined use of saponification and HPLC quantification of the released propionic acid. Their thermal properties were investigated by DSC and TGA, and an intermediate residue of the pyrolysis was also examined by FT-IR spectroscopy. From the thermal degradation measurements using TGA, the C 6 -O phosphorylation was found to noticeably prevent the CP derivatives from weight loss in the pyrolysis process under dynamic air, i. e., providing them with a flame-resistance functionality, whereas the C 2 -O and C 3 -O phosphorylation did not give rise to such an appreciable resistance effect. A discussion was focused on the difference in pyrolysis mechanism between the phosphorylated CPs. However, most samples of the CP derivatives showed a clear T g considerably lower than the onset temperature of the thermal degradation.

40|$|Blend {{miscibility}} of <b>cellulose</b> <b>propionate</b> (CP) with synthetic copolymers comprising N-vinyl pyrrolidone (VP) and {{vinyl acetate}} (VAc) units was examined, and a data map was constructed {{as a function}} of the degree of substitution (DS) of CP and the VP fraction in the copolymer component. Results of differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared measurements indicated that the pairing of CP/P(VP-co-VAc) formed a miscible or immiscible blend system according to the balance in effectiveness of the following factors: (1) hydrogen bonding between residual hydroxyls of CP and VP carbonyls of P(VP-co-VAc); (2) steric hindrance of propionyl side-groups to the interaction specified in (1); (3) intramolecular repulsion between the two units constituting the vinyl copolymer; and, additionally, (4) structural affinity between two segmental moieties involving the propionyl group and VAc unit, respectively. The factor 3 inducing intercomponent attraction is responsible for the appearance of a so-called "miscibility window" in the miscibility map, and the factor 4 substantially expands the miscible region whole, wider relative to those in the maps for the corresponding blend series based on cellulose acetate and butyrate. In further refined estimation by dynamic mechanical analysis and T_[1 ρ]^H quantification in solid-state [13]C NMR, it was found that the miscible blends of hydrogen-bonding type (using CPs of DS 2. 7) formed blends exhibiting a somewhat larger size of heterogeneity (ca. 5 – 20 nm) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prepare highly porous carrier {{particles}} by emulsion solvent evaporation and compare the loading capacity of these beads with two traditional carriers, sugar beads, and microcrystalline cellulose granules during an interactive mixing process.

On average the loading capacity of the new carrier was 310 % that of sugar beads and 320 % that of MCC granules during an interactive mixing process with very good content uniformity. The tableting properties of the microcapsules were equivalent to that of microcrystalline cellulose granules, and the dissolution of the drugs from interactive mixtures prepared with the new carrier was equivalent to that of drug suspensions.

A validated dynamic, computer-controlled in vitro system simulating the conditions in the proximal large intestine (TIM- 2) was used. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) consumption in the system was used as an indicator of fermentability and SCFA and branched chain fatty acids (BCFA) production was determined. NaOH consumption was significantly higher for Fructooligosaccharide (FOS) than PGX, which was higher than cellulose (p = 0. 002). At 32, 48 and 72 h, acetate and butyrate production were higher for FOS and PGX versus <b>cellulose.</b> <b>Propionate</b> production was higher for PGX than cellulose at 32, 48, 56 and 72 h and higher than FOS at 72 h (p = 0. 014).

50|$|Cellulose diacetate {{film was}} first {{created by the}} German chemists Arthur Eichengrün and Theodore Becker, who {{patented}} it under the name Cellit, from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate.

The blend system using CP among the three CEs imparted the largest region of miscible pairings with the vinyl copolymers, and both of the maps for the CP/P(VP-[co]-VAc) and CP/P(VP-[co]-MMA) systems comprised a "miscibility window" associated with the respective copolymer compositions at high DSs of > 2. 65. The present work was made to interpret the expansion of the miscible markings for the CP/copolymer systems in comparison with the cases using CA and CB, in terms of a Krigbaum–Wall interaction parameter (μ) obtained by solution viscometry for selective polymer pairs involved in the respective CE/copolymer blends. The results of μ measurements were in good accordance with the earlier miscibility estimations. The assessment of very small negative μ values (i. e., extremely weak repulsion) for CP/PVAc and CP/PMMA combinations and that of considerably larger negative μ values for PVP/PVAc and PVP/PMMA combinations enabled us to give a rational explanation for the CP systems. The strongly repellent character of the two different monomer units constituting the copolymers permits accession of the CP component (DS > 2. 65) to them, which would be responsible for the advent of the miscibility window. Further expansion of the window observed when <b>cellulose</b> acetate <b>propionate</b> (CAP) was adopted instead of CP as the CE component was also well explained on the basis of a μ data indicative of additional intramolecular repulsion in the CAP side...|$|R
40|$|Orientation {{birefringence}} and its wavelength dispersion are {{studied for}} hot-drawn films of cellulose esters such as cellulose triacetate (CTA), cellulose diacetate (CDA), and <b>cellulose</b> acetate <b>propionate</b> (CAP) exposed to three different humidities of environments. Hot-drawn CTA films show negative birefringence that decreases with increasing wavelength. On the other hand, CDA and CAP films show positive birefringence that increases with increasing wavelength, i. e., the so-called extraordinary wavelength dispersion of birefringence. Upon exposure to high humidity environment, the orientation birefringence of CDA and CAP decreases. The decrease is prominent for the samples containing {{a large amount}} of water. CTA, however, shows an increase in magnitude of its negative orientation birefringence with increasing moisture content. The results {{can be explained by the}} increase of the polarizability anisotropy perpendicular to the stretching direction in the cellulose esters. It is found from ATR-FTIR measurements that hydrogen bonds are formed between carbonyl groups of cellulose esters and water molecules. Considering that orientation birefringence of cellulose esters is determined mainly by ester groups, the formation of hydrogen bonds contributes to the polarizability anisotropy, thus affecting the orientation birefringence...|$|R
40|$|Orientation {{birefringence}} and its wavelength dispersion {{for various}} types of cellulose esters are reviewed. Cellulose esters such as <b>cellulose</b> acetate <b>propionate</b> (CAP) and <b>cellulose</b> acetate butyrate (CAB) show positive orientation birefringence with extraordinary wavelength dispersion, which is determined mainly by the ester groups rather than the main chains. The acetyl group provides negative orientation birefringence with strong ordinary wavelength dispersion, whereas the propionyl and butyryl groups give positive orientation birefringence with weak wavelength dispersion. Although all groups show ordinary wavelength dispersion, the summation of their orientation birefringences gives extraordinary dispersion. Moreover, the wavelength dispersion {{is dependent on the}} stretching ratio due to the difference in the orientation relaxation of each group. On the contrary, cellulose triacetate (CTA) shows negative birefringence with ordinary wavelength dispersion because it has no positive contribution. However, doping a plasticizer having positive orientation birefringence changes the orientation birefringence of CTA from negative to positive, and the wavelength dispersion from ordinary to extraordinary. This is attributed to the cooperative orientation of plasticizer molecules to the stretching direction with CTA chains, known as nematic interaction upon a hot drawing process...|$|R
40|$|Effect of the {{addition}} of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) to <b>cellulose</b> acetate <b>propionate</b> (CAP) on the optical anisotropy is studied considering the morphology and molecular orientation. It is found that PLA is miscible with CAP when the amount of PLA is less than 3 wt%. The dissolution of PLA chains having large intrinsic birefringence into CAP phase enhances the orientation birefringence of a stretched film, although the viscosity and thus the relaxation time of PLA is significantly shorter than those of CAP. The high level of orientation of PLA chains without relaxation is attained by the cooperative alignment with CAP chains. As a result, a retardation film having appropriate birefringence can be designed by polymer blends composed of biomass-based materials. When the amount of PLA is more than 3 wt%, however, phase separation occurs. In {{the case of the}} blends with phase-separated morphology, the orientation birefringence is not greatly enhanced by blending PLA, because the molecular orientation of PLA in PLA phase relaxes immediately as compared with that of CAP...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{flexible}} chain on orientation dynamics {{of a small}} additive molecule in <b>cellulose</b> acetate <b>propionate</b> (CAP) films is investigated during stretching by means of measurements of birefringence and polarized Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum. The orientation birefringence is enhanced by the additives such as ethylene 2, 6 -naphthalate (C_ 2 Np) and hexamethylene 2, 6 -naphthalate (C_ 6 Np) oligomers, suggesting that the additives orient parallel to the CAP chain due to an intermolecular orientation correlation called as the nematic interaction (NI). At a high drawing temperature, the orientation of C_ 2 Np is stronger than that of C_ 6 Np, indicating that the flexible alkyl chain reduces the intermolecular NI with CAP. In contrast, C_ 6 Np orients to the stretching direction rather than C_ 2 Np at a low temperature. The polarized FT-IR spectra show that the orientation of rigid part in C_ 6 Np is delayed {{from that of the}} flexible group and matrix CAP chain. Consequently, the contribution of C_ 6 Np to birefringence and its wavelength dependence become stronger with increasing the draw ratio...|$|R
5000|$|Nitrate {{dominated}} {{the market for}} professional-use 35 mm motion picture film from the industry's origins to the early 1950s. While cellulose acetate-based so-called [...] "safety film", notably cellulose diacetate and <b>cellulose</b> acetate <b>propionate,</b> was produced in the gauge for small-scale use in niche applications (e.g., printing advertisements and other short films {{to enable them to}} be sent through the mails without the need for fire safety precautions), the early generations of safety film base had two major disadvantages relative to nitrate: it was much more expensive to manufacture, and considerably less durable in repeated projection. The cost of the safety precautions {{associated with the use of}} nitrate was significantly lower than the cost of using any of the safety bases available before 1948. These drawbacks were eventually overcome with the launch of cellulose triacetate base film by Eastman Kodak in 1948. [...] Cellulose triacetate superseded nitrate as the film industry's mainstay base very quickly. While Kodak had discontinued some nitrate film stocks earlier, they stopped producing various nitrate roll films in 1950 and ceased production of nitrate 35mm motion picture film in 1951.|$|R
40|$|The Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) / <b>Cellulose</b> acetate <b>propionate</b> (CAP) /Poly {{ethylene}} glycerol (PEG) blends {{were prepared}} by melt-blending. The PLA {{effect on the}} thermal properties, surface morphology and processing property (MFI, melt flow index) of CAP/PEG blends was investigated. For the reason of CAP blended with PEG that the thermal stability of compounding was damaged. In this study, PLA was used for increasing the thermal stability of CAP/PEG blend. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) showed that when the PLA was added in CAP/PEG blend, the thermal stability of compound was increased from 124 ℃ to 300 ℃. SEM showed that the dispersion of PLA was uniform in CAP/PEG blend when the ratio of PLA and CAP/PEG was 1 : 6. The same phenomena was also showed in mechanical loss factor (tanδ) of DMA. The MFI of PLA/CAP/PEG blends could be increase from 42. 96 g/ 10 min to 56. 58 g/ 10 min by adding PLA. Experiment Poly(-D,L-lactic-acid) (PLA) (Cargill Dow) and cellulose acetate propionate(CAP) (Eaterman 4) were prepared in this study. Poly ethylene glycol (PEG 600, 1000, 1500) were used for plasticizer in this study. PLA was blended with CAP at 215 ℃ to form composites. Afte...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} {{and development of}} composites making use of natural fibers, aimed for automotive applications, is growing from a long- term sustainable perspective. A prime reason for selecting natural fibers for new products is that the net contribution to the greenhouse effect is minimal. Equally important is their low weight compared to glass fibers and their positive effect on crash management. Based on an advantageous cost/performance ratio, natural fiber based composites have been in use for quite a few years in automotive interior applications. Well-known examples are door panels based on flax/sisal fibers and polymeric binders like polypropylene (thermoplastic) or polyurethane/epoxy/polyester/phenolic (thermoset). A {{problem is that the}} polymeric binder (20 - 50 % by weight) is based on a non- renewable resource, namely crude oil, and that material recycling is difficult and costly even if a thermoplastic binder is used and that energy recovery is not accepted as recycling at the time being. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the possibility of producing a biodegradable composite using <b>Cellulose</b> Acetate <b>Propionate</b> (CAP) plasticized with TriEthyl Citrate (TEC) as binder matrix polymer in natural fiber based composites aimed for automotive interior applications.
