The World Resources Institute has identified 375 hypoxic <b>coastal</b> <b>zones</b> around the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly in Japan.

25|$|The nitrogen-rich {{compounds}} {{found in}} fertilizer runoff {{are the primary}} cause of serious oxygen depletion in many parts of oceans, especially in <b>coastal</b> <b>zones,</b> lakes and rivers.

As of 2006, the application of nitrogen fertilizer is being increasingly controlled in northwestern Europe and the United States. If eutrophication can be reversed, it may take decades before the accumulated nitrates in groundwater can be broken down by natural processes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—China’s <b>coastal</b> <b>zone</b> is {{experiencing}} rapid population growth, increased {{economic development and}} continuing urbanization which exacerbates coastal ecosystem degradation and environmental deterioration. Integrated <b>coastal</b> <b>zone</b> management (ICZM) is adopted by the Chinese government as a promising management mechanism to alleviate the conflicts in economic growth, social stability and environmental protection, so as to achieve more sustainable coastal development. This paper, based on a PhD program on the legal and regulatory framework for ICZM, demonstrates the current legislation and institutions for <b>coastal</b> <b>zone</b> management in China and discussed their constraints in achieving ICZM. The research findings indicated that the Chinese government should manage the <b>coastal</b> <b>zone</b> as one unit with both land and waters being considered. Therefore, a national coastal law is necessary for such a vast country as China and the integration among agencies {{is essential for the}} legislation.

2500|$|At the {{occasion}} of the 10th anniversary of the Dutch dune conservation foundation (Stichting Duinbehoud), the 1st European Dune Conference was organized in September 1987, which brought together ecologists, academics and managers of sand dune coasts from twelve European countries, in Leiden, the Netherlands, to discuss future directions for conservation management. As a result of this conference the European Union for Dune conservation & Coastal management (EUDC) was launched and formally founded in Leiden, the Netherlands, on 6 January 1989, as an association under the Dutch law. Its first undertaking consisted in producing an inventory of coastal dunes throughout Europe. Under the leadership of its Director General Albert Salman, the association evolved towards a broader coastal scope and then changed the name to European Union for Coastal Conservation (EUCC) in 1991 at {{the occasion}} of the 3rd International Conference in Galway (Ireland). Since then, the abbreviation has been kept. Milestones of the first period are the organisation of the 1st European Coastal Conservation Conference in Scheveningen 1991, and a contribution to the preparation of the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy (PEBLDS), adopted in 1995 by the Environment for Europe Ministers Conference. Later on, under the auspices of UNEP and the Council of Europe, EUCC led the elaboration of the European Coastal & Marine Ecological Network (ECMEN) [...] and the European Code of Conduct for <b>Coastal</b> <b>Zones.</b> The latter was officially adopted by the Council of Europe Ministers in 1999.|$|E
