5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These animals have very large heads, which <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> as much as 40% of their body mass, {{and much of the}} head is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this bird}} eats rice on the {{wintering}} grounds, where it <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and threshing, not harvestable grain. It {{has sometimes been}} viewed as a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the wader has little effect on crop yield.|$|E
5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores. In almost all cases, one endospore is formed {{and this is}} not a reproductive process, although Anaerobacter <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> to seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound that composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. It is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the endospore.|$|E

5|$|The sloth bear, {{though not}} as {{specialised}} as polar bears and the panda, has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears, and developed a long, suctioning tongue to feed on the ants, termites, and other burrowing insects they favour. At certain times of the year, these insects <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> 90% of their diets. Some species may raid the nests of wasps and bees for the honey and immature insects, in spite of stinging from the adults. Sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey. Fish are {{an important source of}} food for some species, and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at salmon runs. Typically, a bear plunges into the water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws. The preferred parts to eat are the brain and eggs. Small burrowing mammals like rodents may be dug out and eaten.|$|E
5|$|When {{foraging}} for plants, bears {{choose to}} eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible, typically avoiding older grasses, sedges and leaves. Hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted. Knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behaviour. Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits, which affects their behaviour. Smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast (edible reproductive parts, such as acorns). Such masts can be {{very important to the}} diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources. Brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots. The panda's diet is over 99% bamboo, of 30 different species. Its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves. Bromeliads <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> to 50% of the diet of the spectacled bear, which also has strong jaws to bite them open.|$|E

Bats which only incorporate a portion of polymer (and the rest either wood or an aluminum alloy) are referred to as composite hybrid bats. These composite material provides an advantage over aluminum alloys and wood in durability, weight distribution, improved trampoline effect, and a higher damping rate (to reduce hand sting).|$|E
25|$|Room and {{pillar mining}} {{consists}} of coal deposits that are mined by cutting {{a network of}} rooms into the coal seam. Pillars of coal are left behind {{in order to keep}} up the roof.

25|$|Software {{development}} is a complex process, and developers are often uncertain {{how long it will}} take to complete any given project. Fixing errors in software, for example, <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> a significant portion of its development time, and developers are motivated not to release software with errors because it could damage their reputation with customers. Last-minute design changes are also common. Large organizations seem to have more late projects than smaller ones, and may benefit from hiring individual programmers on contract to write software than using in-house development teams. Adding people to a late software project does not help; according to Brooks' Law, doing so increases the delay.|$|E

25|$|An {{effective}} fast bowler {{needs to}} be able to hold a consistent line and length, or in common terms, to be accurate. In this context, line refers to the path of the ball towards the batsman, in the horizontal dimension running from the off to the leg side, while length describes the distance the ball travels toward the batsman before bouncing. Variations in length is generally seen as the more important of the two for a fast bowler. The faster the bowler, the harder it is to achieve consistent line and length but sheer speed <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for the shortfall. Fast bowlers who also manage to be accurate can be devastatingly effective, for example the likes of Australian pace bowler Glenn McGrath and South African pace bowler Shaun Pollock.|$|E
25|$|While most big cat {{species are}} individual, ambush predators, Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are pursuit predators. Widely {{known as the}} fastest {{terrestrial}} animal, with speeds reaching 61–64 miles per hour, cheetahs {{take advantage of their}} speed during chases. However, their speed and acceleration also have disadvantages, as both can only be sustained for short periods of time. Studies show that cheetahs can maintain maximum speed for a distance of approximately 500 yards. Due to these limitations, cheetahs are often observed running at moderate speeds during chases. There are claims that the key to cheetahs' pursuit success may not be just their speed. Cheetahs are extremely agile, able to maneuver and change directions at very high speeds in very short amounts of time. This extensive maneuverability <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for unsustainable high speed pursuit, as it allows cheetahs to quickly close the distance between prey without decreasing their speed when prey change direction.|$|E
25|$|The AMA is {{composed}} of various internal groups that discuss policy twice a year. There is an annual meeting, always held in Chicago, IL and an Interim meeting set on a rotating schedule for different locations. Within the AMA, there are sections that <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the total AMA. These sections include Medical Students, Resident and Fellows, Academic physicians, Medical School Deans and Faculty, Physicians in group practice setting, Retired and Senior Physicians, International Medical graduates, Woman physicians, Physician Diversity and Minority health, GLBT, USAN, AMA board of Trustees, Foundation and Council. Externally to the AMA, there are organizations that come to these meetings by sending representatives. These representatives meet two {{a year in the}} House of Delegates at the Interim and/or annual meeting. Representatives come from medical societies that are either from a state, specialty or the federal services/government services. These organizations are called AMA member organizations.|$|E
50|$|Although leaves tend to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the {{majority}} of the mantled howler's diet, fruit <b>can</b> also <b>make</b> <b>up</b> {{a large portion of the}} diet. When available, the proportion of fruit in the diet can be as much as 50%, and can sometimes exceed the proportion of leaves. The leaves and fruit from Ficus trees tend to be the preferred source of the mantled howler. Flowers <b>can</b> also <b>make</b> <b>up</b> a significant portion of the diet and are eaten in particularly significant quantities during the dry season. The mantled howler tends to get the water it needs from its food, drinking from tree holes during the wet season, and by drinking water trapped in bromeliads.|$|R
