Its modeling capabilities, however, are somewhat limited since it discards the spatial and temporal order of the codewords.

The temporal context is incorporated in three scales that capture different aspects of the variability between different performances of the same action.

In an analogous manner, protein interaction domains such as the Src Homology 2 (SH 2) domain recognize and “read” the information contained within their cognate peptide ligands to determine highly selective protein–protein interactions that underpin much of cellular signal transduction. Herein, we discuss how <b>contextual</b> <b>sequence</b> information, which combines the use of permissive and non-permissive residues within a parent motif, is a defining feature of selective interactions across SH 2 domains. Within a system that reads phosphotyrosine modifications this provides crucial information to distinguish preferred interactions.

40|$|Abstract — DNA {{sequence}} basecalling {{is commonly}} {{regarded as a}} solved problem, despite significant error rates being reflected in inaccuracies in databases and genome annotations. This has made measures of confidence of basecalls important, and fuzzy methods have recently been used to approximate confidence by responding to data quality at the calling position. We have demonstrated that variation in <b>contextual</b> <b>sequencing</b> trace data peak heights actively encodes novel information {{which can be used}} for basecalling and confidence estimation. Using neuro-fuzzy classifiers we are able to decode much of the hidden contextual information in two fuzzy rules per base and partially reveal its underlying behaviour. Those two fuzzy rules can satisfactory explain over 74 % of data samples. The error rate is 6 - 7 % higher on individual bases than when using classification trees, but the number of rules is reduced by a factor of 100. Compact comprehensible knowledge representation is achieved with the use of SANFIS which allows us to easily interpret the embedded knowledge. Finally, we propose a hybrid architecture based on SANFIS which achieves slightly better performance than a classification tree with significantly improved knowledge representation. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Sequence optimization, {{where the}} items in a list are ordered to {{maximize}} some reward has many applications such as web advertisement placement, search, and control libraries in robotics. Previous work in sequence optimization produces a static ordering that does not take any features of the item or context of the problem into account. In this work, we propose a general approach to order the items within the sequence based on the context (e. g., perceptual information, environment description, and goals). We take a simple, efficient, reduction-based approach where the choice and order of the items is established by repeatedly learning simple classifiers or regressors for each “slot ” in the sequence. Our approach leverages recent work on submodular function maximization to provide a formal regret reduction from submodular sequence optimization to simple costsensitive prediction. We apply our <b>contextual</b> <b>sequence</b> prediction algorithm to optimize control libraries and demonstrate results on two robotics problems: manipulator trajectory prediction and mobile robot path planning.

40|$|The pluripotency control regions (PluCRs) {{are defined}} as genomic regions that are bound by POU 5 F 1, SOX 2, and NANOG in vivo. We {{utilized}} a high-throughput binding assay to record more than 270, 000 different DNA/protein binding measurements along incrementally tiled windows of DNA within these PluCRs. This high-resolution binding map is then used to systematically define the context of POU factor binding, and reveals patterns of cooperativity and competition in the pluripotency network. The most prominent pattern is a pervasive binding competition between POU 5 F 1 and the forkhead transcription factors. Like many transcription factors, POU 5 F 1 is co-expressed with a paralog, POU 2 F 1, that shares an apparently identical binding specificity. By analyzing thousands of binding measurements, we discover context effects that discriminate POU 2 F 1 from POU 5 F 1 binding. Proximal NANOG binding promotes POU 5 F 1 binding, whereas nearby SOX 2 binding favors POU 2 F 1. We demonstrate by cross-species comparison and by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that the <b>contextual</b> <b>sequence</b> determinants learned in vitro are sufficient to predict POU 2 F 1 binding in vivo...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{current study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the underlying mechanism of how perceived duration of a visual target is modulated by perceptual as well as contextual magnitude induced by Arabic numbers. 	METHODS: The current study combined context manipulation with duration judgement. In the learning phase, participants were trained to categorize 340, 400, and 460 ms intervals as short, medium, and long durations, respectively. The subsequent testing phase included small magnitude context (10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30), large magnitude context (70, 80, 90, 70, 80, 90) and mixed magnitude context (10, 20, 30, 70, 80, 90). The participants first rated whether {{each of the six}} numbers in the <b>contextual</b> <b>sequence</b> was ‘‘smaller’’ or ‘‘larger’’ than 50. Then, a small (10 or 20) or large (80 or 90) target number was presented visually with a varying duration (340 ~ 460 ms). Participants were required to categorize each target as a short, medium, or long duration.   	RESULTS: The perceived durations increased with physical durations significantly. The NTA effects, i. e., the over-/under- estimation of the durations of perceptual large/small numbers, were observed only during small, but not large or mixed magnitude context. More critically, the interaction of numerical context and target magnitude was significant. Large targets preceded by small magnitude context were rated as lasting longer, relative to large magnitude context. Whereas, small targets preceded by large magnitude context were rated as lasting longer, relative to small magnitude context. 	CONCLUSIONS: The current results extend our understanding to the mechanism of NTA. The magnitude information existing in perceptual as well as contextual space can modulate perceived duration of a visual target and lead to a repetition suppression effect, suggesting inseparability of a hypothetic magnitude continuum across the border between physical present and contextual past. The repetition suppression effect is likely due to a reduction of neural activity of numerical representation, consistent with the neural amplitude hypothesis. </p...|$|E

After it has been trained with examples of four-part chorales, the EBM is able to distinguish different styles of chorales in unseen pieces of music.

In particular, it is able to complete arbitrary length <b>contextual</b> <b>sequences</b> from learned local context, and synthesise musical harmony for polyphonic music. ln this paper we show that the EBM is able to distinguish chorales from the Baroque period from Norwegian chorales. In summary, the EBM is able to distinguish, firstly, between chorales present in the training set and those that are not. Secondly, the EBM is also able to distinguish chorales of different styles, where one style was used in the training set. We also show that two different EBMs (one trained from examples from Choralbuch and the other trained from Norwegian chorales) are able to distinguish between two different harmonised styles of the same chorale melody.

40|$|Upstream AUGs (uAUGs) and {{upstream}} open reading frames (uORFs) {{are common}} features of mRNAs that encode regulatory proteins {{and have been}} shown to profoundly influence translation of the main ORF. In this study, we employed a series of artificial 5 ′-untranslated regions (5 ′-UTRs) containing one or more uAUGs/uORFs to systematically assess translation initiation at the main AUG by leaky scanning and reinitiation mechanisms. Constructs containing either one or two uAUGs in varying contexts but without an in-frame stop codon upstream of the main AUG were used to analyse the leaky scanning mechanism. This analysis largely confirmed the ranking of different AUG <b>contextual</b> <b>sequences</b> that was determined previously by Kozak. In addition, this ranking was the same for both the first and second uAUGs, although the magnitude of initiation efficiency differed. Moreover, ∼ 10 % of ribosomes exhibited leaky scanning at uAUGs in the most favourable context and initiated at a downstream AUG. A second group of constructs containing different numbers of uORFs, each with optimal uAUGs, were used to measure the capacity for reinitiation. We found significant levels of initiation at the main ORF even in constructs containing four uORFs, with nearly 10 % of ribosomes capable of reinitiating five times. This study shows that for mRNAs containing multiple uORFs/uAUGs, ribosome reinitiation and leaky scanning are efficient mechanisms for initiation at their main AUGs...|$|R

This study systematically describes the sequence patterns used in science test-item contexts and presents empirical evidence that demonstrate {{the ways in which}} the sequence patterns of contextual information support or hinder student {{performance on}} science tests. Contextual information includes supplemental information, such as a vignette or selected background facts that precede or follow a test item. This study addressed three gaps in the literature on contextualized items by providing the following in order to advance knowledge about how to achieve consistently equitable testing: a consistent theory-based framework for selecting test-item characteristics to be studied; new knowledge about how student performance is influenced by specific test item elements or features; and a better understanding of subgroups of students and their performance. The design and data analyses were framed by three research questions: (1) How is providing the sequence of information presented in item contexts associated with student performance? (2) Considering different levels of linguistic demands in various contexts, how is the <b>contextual</b> <b>sequence</b> linked to science performance of ELLs and non-ELLs? ESLs and non-ELLs? (3) How do different dimensions of sequence of context influence how students perceive and respond to tasks? This study included multiple facets of inquiry, including test-item creation, psychometrics, and student cognitive interviews. It generated item-development guidelines based on dimensions of context sequence. Items resulting from this process were designed to evoke students’ stored knowledge relevant to the content and/or process skills being assessed. The newly developed science items were field tested with a diverse population of students from middle schools and high schools in China and the U. S. A range of psychometric and statistical procedures were applied to student test scores. In particular, this project produced both theory and empirical evidence regarding how the sequence of contextual information can be attributed to differential performance among English as Second Language Learners (ESL), English language learners (ELL) and non-ELL groups. Findings from the ESL, ELL, and non-ELL comparisons led to important improvements in how items are developed to ensure test fairness...|$|E

Previous studies identified a TGN localization signal (TLS) in the C-terminal cytosolic tail of Kex 2 p consisting of Tyr- 713 and <b>contextual</b> <b>sequences.</b> Further analysis of the Kex 2 p TLS revealed similarity to the Ste 13 p TLS. Mutation of the Kex 2 p TLS results in transport of Kex 2 p to the vacuole by default. When expression of a GAL 1 promoter-driven KEX 2 gene is shut off in MAT(alpha) cells, the TGN becomes depleted of Kex 2 p, resulting in a gradual decline in mating competence which is greatly accelerated by TLS mutations. To identify the genes involved in localization of Kex 2 p, we isolated second-site suppressors of the rapid loss of mating competence observed upon shutting off expression of a TLS mutant form of Kex 2 p (Y 713 A). Seven of 58 suppressors were allele specific, suppressing point mutations at Tyr- 713 but not deletions of the TLS or entire C-terminal cytosolic tail. By linkage analysis, the allele-specific suppressors defined three genetic loci, SOI 1, S 0 I 2, and S 0 I 3. Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that these suppressors increased net TGN retention of both Y 713 A Kex 2 p and a Ste 13 p-Pho 8 p fusion protein containing a point mutation in the Ste 13 p TLS. SOI 1 suppressor alleles reduced the efficiency of localization of wild-type Kex 2 p to the TGN, implying an impaired ability to discriminate between the normal TLS and a mutant TLS. soi 1 mutants also exhibited a recessive defect in vacuolar protein sorting. Suppressor alleles of S 0 I 2 were dominant. These {{results suggest that the}} SOI 1 and S 0 I 2 genes encode regulators or components of the TLS recognition machinery...|$|R

The consistent capture and structured submission of these data is crucial for integrated data analysis and ecosystems modeling. The application MetaBar has been developed, to support consistent contextual data acquisition. Results MetaBar is a spreadsheet and web-based software tool designed to assist users in the consistent acquisition, electronic storage, and submission of contextual data associated to their samples. A preconfigured Microsoft ® Excel ® spreadsheet is used to initiate structured contextual data storage in the field or laboratory. Each sample is given a unique identifier and at any stage the sheets can be uploaded to the MetaBar database server. To label samples, identifiers can be printed as barcodes. An intuitive web interface provides quick access to the contextual data in the MetaBar database as well as user and project management capabilities. Export functions facilitate <b>contextual</b> and <b>sequence</b> data submission to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), comprising of the DNA DataBase of Japan (DDBJ), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory database (EMBL) and GenBank.

Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (ACM SIGIR); ACM SIGWEBTraditional pattern mining methods usually work on single data sources. However, in practice, {{there are often}} multiple and heterogeneous information sources. They collectively provide contextual information not available in any single source alone describing the same set of objects, and are useful for discovering hidden contextual patterns. One important challenge is to provide a general methodology to mine contextual patterns easily and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a general framework to encode contextual information from multiple sources into a coherent representation - -Contextual Information Graph (CIG). The complexity of the encoding scheme is linear in both time and space. More importantly, CIG can be handled by any single-source pattern mining algorithms that accept taxonomies without any modification.

However {{many of these}} systems have little to no awareness of the personally-understood user context which expresses why they are being used. In this {{paper we propose a}} framework for modelling and proactively retrieving previously accessed and created information objects and resources that are {{within the context of a}} user’s current situation. We first consider theories of context to understand the discrete aspects of context that may delineate a user’s composite situations. With this we develop a framework for modelling user interaction in context along with a re-configurable algorithm for making personal recommendations for desired information objects based upon the environmental, content-based and task <b>sequence</b> <b>contextual</b> similarity of the current situation to past situations. To measure the effectiveness of our approach we use a two week activity log from four real users in a preliminary lab-based evaluation methodology. Initial results suggest the framework as a static personal recommendation algorithm is effective to varying degrees during periods of interaction for users of various characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{computational}} {{approach for}} identifying promoters on increasingly large genomic sequences {{has led to}} many false positives. The biological significance of promoter identification lies {{in the ability to}} locate true promoters with and without prior <b>sequence</b> <b>contextual</b> knowledge. Prior approaches to promoter modelling have involved artificial neural networks (ANNs) or hidden Markov models (HMMs), each producing adequate results on small scale identification tasks, i. e. narrow upstream regions. In this work, we present an architecture to support prokaryote promoter identification on large scale genomic sequences, i. e. not limited to narrow upstream regions. The significant contribution involved the hybrid formed via aggregation of the profile HMM with the ANN, via Viterbi scoring optimizations. The benefit obtained using this architecture includes the modelling ability of the profile HMM with the ability of the ANN to associate elements composing the promoter. We present the high effectiveness of the hybrid approach in comparison to profile HMMs and ANNs when used separately. The contribution of Viterbi optimizations is also highlighted for supporting the hybrid architecture in which gains in sensitivity (+ 0. 3), specificity (+ 0. 65) and precision (+ 0. 54) are achieved over existing approaches. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to analyze the formant structure of vowels produced by stutterers and treated stutterers, by comparing their data with those of control subjects. Moreover, we will {{study the effects of}} speech rate increase on the formant structures of the vowels, and that of the three groups of speakers. We chose to analyze French oral vowels [i, a, u], from spectographic data, in two speech rate conditions: normal and fast. By studying these vowels, it becomes possible to explore the limits of the maximum vocalic space, since their productions would reflect maximum articulatory abilities of a speaker, in producing vowel gestures. The three vowels were introduced in [CV] syllables where [C] could be [p], [t] or [k] in order to observe for <b>contextual</b> influences. The <b>sequences</b> were placed in sentences which were repeated ten times by stutterers, treated stutterers and control subjects. Concerning control subjects, several studies (Lindblom, 1963 for example) have shown that an increase of speech rate could provoke a compression of durations and a reduction of the vowel space, i. e. a certain centralization of vowels in this space. However, this phenomenon of centralization was only observed for two vowels, i. e. for [i] and for [u]. What would the result be for stutterers or former stutterers, knowing that the majority of studie...|$|R
40|$|The eight {{mammalian}} Cbx proteins are chromodomain-containing proteins {{involved in}} regulation of heterochromatin, gene expression, and developmental programs. They are evolutionarily {{related to the}} Drosophila HP 1 (dHP 1) and Pc (dPc) proteins that are key components of chromatin-associated complexes capable of recognizing repressive marks such as trimethylated Lys- 9 and Lys- 27, respectively, on histone H 3. However, the binding specificity and function of the human homologs, Cbx 1 – 8, remain unclear. To this end we employed structural, biophysical, and mutagenic approaches to characterize the molecular determinants of <b>sequence</b> <b>contextual</b> methyllysine binding to human Cbx 1 – 8 proteins. Although all three human HP 1 homologs (Cbx 1, - 3, - 5) replicate the structural and binding features of their dHP counterparts, the five Pc homologs (Cbx 2, - 4, - 6, - 7, - 8) bind with lower affinity to H 3 K 9 me 3 or H 3 K 27 me 3 peptides and are unable to distinguish between these two marks. Additionally, peptide permutation arrays revealed a greater sequence tolerance within the Pc family and suggest alternative nonhistone sequences as potential binding targets for this class of chromodomains. Our structures explain the divergence of peptide binding selectivity in the Pc subfamily and highlight previously unrecognized features of the chromodomain that influence binding and specificity...|$|R
40|$|The genome-sequencing {{gold rush}} has {{facilitated}} {{the use of}} comparative genomics to uncover patterns of genome evolution, although their causal mechanisms remain elusive. One such trend, ubiquitous to prokarya and eukarya, is the association of insertion/deletion mutations (indels) with increases in the nucleotide substitution rate extending over hundreds of base pairs. The prevailing hypothesis is that indels are themselves mutagenic agents. Here, we employ population genomics data from Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces paradoxus, and Drosophila to provide evidence suggesting {{that it is not}} the indels per se but the sequence in which indels occur that causes the accumulation of nucleotide substitutions. We found that about two-thirds of indels are closely associated with repeat sequences and that repeat sequence abundance could be used to identify regions of elevated sequence diversity, independently of indels. Moreover, the mutational signature of indel-proximal nucleotide substitutions matches that of error-prone DNA polymerases. We propose that repeat sequences promote an increased probability of replication fork arrest, causing the persistent recruitment of error-prone DNA polymerases to specific sequence regions over evolutionary time scales. Experimental measures of the mutation rates of engineered DNA sequences and analyses of experimentally obtained collections of spontaneous mutations provide molecular evidence supporting our hypothesis. This study uncovers a new role for repeat sequences in genome evolution and provides an explanation of how fine-scale <b>sequence</b> <b>contextual</b> effects influenc...|$|R
30|$|The quality {{interpretation}} {{would explain}} edit events as determined uniquely, or mainly by opinions that editors hold about {{quality of the}} deleted or restored text. Thus, an undo event from user A directed to user B would indicate that A’s quality requirements for contributions to Wikipedia articles are higher than B’s. The quality interpretation would lead to exactly the same hypotheses for the configurations in Fig. 1 as the hierarchical interpretation and would support the same predictions. We note, however, that the quality interpretation is, in fact, an interpretation as text edit events are directly observable, while the quality of text being edited is not. Quality of text is difficult to measure uniquely or unambiguously. It is also unclear that considerations of quality may be generally applicable to sub-sets of words within an article – {{rather than to the}} article as a whole. For example, the internal Wikipedia quality rating system is defined at the level of articles, rather than single chunks of text within the article. We also note that the quality interpretation implies that the quality of Wikipedia articles would increase monotonically with the number of edits – because edits would be driven exclusively by quality considerations. Testing this hypothesis is possible but beyond the objectives of our study. These considerations notwithstanding, there is no doubt that, if measured correctly, the quality of text could be an important <b>contextual</b> factor affecting <b>sequences</b> of text edits.|$|R

This transformation depends {{on both the}} state of the limb and the cues that can identify the context of the movement. How are contextual cues and information about state of the limb combined in the computations of internal models? We considered a reaching task where forces on the hand depended on both the direction of movement (state of the limb) and order of that movement in a predefined <b>sequence</b> (<b>contextual</b> cue). When the cue was available, the motor system formed an internal model that used both serial order and target direction to program motor commands. Assuming that the internal model was formed by a population code through a combination of unknown basis elements, the sensitivity of the bases with respect to state of the limb and contextual cue should dictate how error in one type of movement affected all other movement types. Using a state–space theory, we estimated this generalization function and identified the adaptive system from trial-by-trial changes in performance. The results implied that the basis elements were tuned to direction of movement but output of each basis at its preferred direction was multiplicatively modulated by a weak tuning with respect to the contextual cue. Activity fields that multiplicatively encode diverse sources of information may serve as a general mechanism for a single network to produce context-dependent motor output...|$|R

This phenomenological study was designed to explore the strategies and processes used by successful adult learners when engaged in cognitive learning activity. The study includes exploration of strategies the learner uses to obtain and assimilate information, the learner's perceptions and interpretations of the mental operations which occur, <b>contextual</b> preferences, time <b>sequencing</b> and how the learner knows when learning with understanding has been achieved. The exploration of the meaning of learning and the meaning of the individual learner's cognitive process was integral to the study. The informants were selected according to attributes identified as belonging to "high learners. " These attributes include a high level of schooling (i. e., completion of an advanced degree, either academic or professional, beyond the baccalaureate), satisfaction with self and career, and acknowledgment of self as a successful learner. Interviews were analyzed for emergent themes within each of the components of the total process. The temporal dimension of learning has implications for curriculum design and implementation. A better awareness of the essential structures of the processes involved in cognitive learning as used by successful adult learners will be useful to those educators with responsibility for working with adults in various settings, particularly those in which the learner must be highly autonomous, such as graduate education and distance teaching. The Runic Process (a mysterious, subconscious process which apparently encodes, decodes, transfers and melds new information with old as the learner is occupied with other thoughts) was developed from this study and should be of particular interest to researchers in the study of learning. The seven informants in this study not only rely on the process for their learning projects but also describe this phenomenon better than is otherwise found in the literature...|$|R
