50|$|The {{cockpit of}} the PC-21 {{features}} {{a high level}} of systems integration and conforms to modern avionics standards. The systems of the forward and rear cockpits can be 'de-coupled' between the student and instructor; the instructor may exercise real-time manipulation of the student's displays, sensor performance, and system modes such as to create synthetic air-to-air radar targets, artificial non-safety critical system failures, and controlled data degradation. The aircraft's fully digital glass cockpit features three large colour liquid crystal displays (LCD), one performing as the primary flight display (PFD) and two multi-function displays (MFDs) for system/mission management, in addition to CMC Electronics-provided head-up displays (HUD) for both the pilot and instructor. The trim gauge is the only analogue dial in the cockpit. For control simplicity, a Hands on Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) control philosophy has been followed. Both the display and control systems present also resemble their counterparts used upon modern front-line combat aircraft for greater realism during training; and can be further customized in order to be more representative of specific combat aircraft.

40|$|Worldwide {{differential}} Global Positioning System (WWDGPS) {{is viewed}} as an effective method of offering continuous high-quality navigation worldwide. The concept utilizes a network with as few as 33 ground stations to observe most of the error sources of GPS and provide error corrections to users on a worldwide basis. The WWDGPS real-time GPS tracking concept promises a threefold or fourfold improvement in accuracy for authorized dual-frequency users, and in addition maintains an accurate and current ionosphere model for single-frequency users. A real-time global tracking network also {{has the potential to}} reverse declarations of poor health on marginal satellites, increasing the number of satellites in the constellation and lessening the probability of GPS navigation outage. For Space Shuttle operations, the use of WWDGPS-aided P-code equipment promises performance equal to or better than other current landing guidance systems in terms of accuracy and reliability.

40|$|NASA is {{conducting}} a research program to evaluate differential Global Positioning System (GPS) concepts for <b>civil</b> helicopter <b>navigation.</b> It is {{pointed out that the}} civil helicopter community will probably be an early user of GPS because of the unique mission operations in areas where precise navigation aids are not available. However, many of these applications involve accuracy requirements which cannot be satisfied by conventional GPS.

40|$|Inertial sensors {{have a great}} {{potential}} {{to be used in}} navigation applications. The current field of main applications is the military sector and the <b>civil</b> <b>navigation</b> of vehicles, ships and aircrafts. The Fraunhofer TEG has assembled a very small size interial measurement unit and has studied its performance. Unlike traditional navigation applications this system has been developed to track the position and orientation of hand-held devices. For these applications the prior knowledge of the environment and the usage of the system can be applied to develop specific algorithms. The basic algorithms for the data analysis of this 6 degrees of freedom solution have been already realised. Through this {{it has been shown that}} low-cost miniaturised intertial systems have sufficient accuracy if additional information of the position or orientation of an object is available. In this paper the advantages and disadvantages of inertial sensors for indoor navigation of hand-held devices will be discussed. Recommendations will be given on how the inertial sensors can be integrated in a navigation unit, which itself can be part of a small hand-held device. The new application specific algorithms will be briefly explaind on the development of an acceleration based computer mouse.

40|$|With {{the launch}} of the GPS-IIF satellites, the new <b>civil</b> <b>navigation</b> signals at L 5 (1176. 45 MHz) will become {{available}} to the GNSS community. One of the most significant benefits introduced by this new signal is that the dual-frequency measurement combination of L 5 and the existing L 1 C/A signals will eliminate the largest GPS measurement error- the ionosphere delay affecting the L 1 -only signal. The ionosphere delay will be removed by forming an Iono-free GPS code measurement combination with the dual-frequency signal. Thus, the performances of many GNSS navigation applications, such as the accuracy and integrity metrics in civil aviation, will be dramatically improved. The dual-frequency code measurement combination process suppresses the ionosphere delay; however, it is a double-edged sword, as the combination also increases the contributions of multi-path and receiver noise errors on the GPS measurements. Therefore, carrier smoothing is applied to alleviate the negative impact of these errors. In this paper, the effects of these errors are investigated using the flight test GPS measurement data obtained from FAA flight trials conducted at Memphis International Airport. This data uses the currently available dual frequency data based upon L 1 C/A and L 2 P(Y) semi-codeless signals (since the L 5 signal is not available yet, the L 2 signal is used as a substitute). This paper also analyzes the effectiveness of the carrier smoothing process for airborne GPS code measurements, in mitigating the increased noise due to the Iono-free measurement combination. The resulting ranging signal qualities of the dual frequency measurements are compared against the qualities of the WAAS-corrected L 1 -only measurements...|$|E
40|$|With the {{introducing}} of GPS (Global Positioning System) Block ⅡR-M satellites in 2005, a new civil signal (L 2 C) was transmitted on L 2 frequency, and two new signals (L 5 I and L 5 Q) {{on a new}} frequency (L 5) {{were also}} introduced as standard signals with Block ⅡF satellites beginning in 2010. In addition to the timing group delay (TGD) parameter contained in the legacy navigation (LNAV) message, four additional inter-signal correction (ISC) parameters are introduced in the new <b>civil</b> <b>navigation</b> (CNAV) message to provide corrections for L 1 C/A, L 2 C and L 5 signals with respect to L 1 P(Y) signal. In this study, the ISC correction models are first developed for GPS single-and dual-frequency navigation users. Thereafter ISCs are validated with the differential code bias (DCB) products of different organizations, and several standard point positioning (SPP) schemes are also carried out to analyze the impact of ISCs on GPS standard positioning. The {{results indicate that the}} precision of broadcast ISC C/A is about 0. 2 ns, and those of TGD, ISC L 2 C and ISC L 5 Q are about 0. 5 ns. The positioning accuracy of the SPP solution based on GPS L 2 C signals applying ISC corrections improves 30. 6 % and that based on L 1 C/A and L 2 C ionosphere-free combination improves 12. 2 % at 12 multi-GNSS experiment (MGEX) stations during day of year (DOY) 300 - 310 in 2014, compared to the solutions without the consideration of ISCs. For GPS dual-frequency users, the broadcast ISCs enable a level of accuracy that is competitive with ionosphere-free combination of the present L 1 P(Y) and L 2 P(Y) signals...|$|E
