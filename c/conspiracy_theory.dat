Results revealed that exposure to information supporting <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> reduced participants' intentions to engage in politics, relative to participants who were given information refuting <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories.</b> This effect was mediated by feelings of political powerlessness. In Study 2, participants were exposed to <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> concerning the issue of climate change.

Flight 710 was the second of four fatal Widerøe accidents which occurred between 1982 and 1993. In the first accident, Flight 933, a poor cockpit culture had also been discovered, but little was followed up, {{in part because of}} a <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory</b> which surfaced regarding a collision with a fighter jet.

Throughout his life Hitler never wavered in his world view as expounded in Mein Kampf.

With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory,</b> the pair take {{it upon themselves to}} break him out of prison. Manhattan, after looking back on his own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars {{to make the case for}} emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced to come to terms with the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was in fact her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle shocked the Croatian {{commander}} and later resulted in speculation about its cause. Stipetić blamed the 108th Infantry Brigade for {{the collapse of the}} Bosanski Brod bridgehead and the failure of the defence. He claimed the brigade had been pulled back from the battlefield by civilian authorities in Slavonski Brod and thought the {{outcome of the}} battle was predetermined by the Graz agreement of the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat leaders, Radovan Karadžić and Mate Boban. General Karl Gorinšek, commander in charge of defending neighboring Slavonia during Posavina's fall, said that the Croatian administration showed no interest in defending Posavina and that he continuously got orders to not take any initiative in defending the territory. Stipetić's view regarding the Graz agreement is echoed by British historian Marko Attila Hoare, who claims that the area conceded by the Croats during Operation Corridor 92 was traded for western Herzegovina. On the other hand, Croatian-American historian James J. Sadkovich, among others, described that view as a <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory.</b> While some sources have proposed that the area was traded for the JNA-held Prevlaka Peninsula near Dubrovnik, a Central Intelligence Agency analysis concluded that there is no direct evidence of such arrangements.|$|E
5|$|While the Enterprise is {{en route}} to Pacifica on a {{scientific}} mission, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives a highly confidential message from an old friend, Captain Walker Keel (Jonathan Farwell) of the USS Horatio. Keel refuses to discuss his concerns, even though the frequency he is using {{is supposed to be}} a secure channel, and insists on a face-to-face meeting. Once they arrive at Dytallix B for this secret meeting, the crew discover the Horatio and two other Federation ships already present. Picard beams alone to the surface and is met by Captain Keel and the other captains. Keel reports strange orders from Starfleet headquarters and what he implies are suspicious deaths of Starfleet officers, and expresses concern of a conspiracy. Picard refuses to accept this without proof, but Keel warns him to remain wary. When the captain returns to the Enterprise, he is challenged by Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) about keeping his contact with Keel secret. Picard is skeptical about the conspiracy, but says that he trusts his old friend completely. The Enterprise resumes its previous journey. Picard has Commander Data (Brent Spiner) review all orders issued by Starfleet Command in the past six months. While the ship is still on its way to Pacifica, a disturbance is detected in nearby space. Upon investigating this, the Enterprise discovers a mass of debris that surely must be the shattered remains of the Horatio. Data completes his study and finds several strange orders from the senior levels of Starfleet. Picard informs his senior staff of the <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theory,</b> and orders the Enterprise to Earth.|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that belief in <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> would be {{predicted by the}} general tendency to attribute agency and intentionality where {{it is unlikely to}} exist.

In Study 1 (N= 202) participants were more likely to agree with a range of <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> if they also tended to attribute intentionality and agency to inanimate objects. As predicted, this relationship accounted for the link between education level and belief in <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories.</b> We replicated this finding in Study 2 (N= 330), whilst taking into account beliefs in paranormal phenomena.

40|$|An {{important}} component of <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> is how they influence, and are influenced by, the evaluation of potential evidence.

A first, small (N= 30) and preliminary study found no relationship between NFCC and beliefs in <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories,</b> suggesting that both advocates and opponents of conspiracy explanations do not differ on this dimension. A second study (N= 86) revealed that evidence for and against <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> had an influence on attributions of the likelihood of a conspiracy to explain a novel event. Specifically, after reading evidence individuals with high levels of belief in <b>conspiracy</b> <b>theories</b> tended to rate a conspiracy explanation as more likely whereas those with low levels of belief rated it as less likely.
