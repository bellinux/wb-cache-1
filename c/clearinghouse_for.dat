40|$|Accommodating couples {{has been}} a long-standing issue {{in the design of}} {{centralized}} labor market <b>clearinghouses</b> <b>for</b> doctors and psychologists, because couples view pairs of jobs as complements.

500|$|In the 1997 legislature, Patton {{began his}} mission of {{reforming}} the state's system of higher education. Noting that the state's community colleges, {{under the control}} of the University of Kentucky, and technical schools, {{under the control of}} the state government, were too often competing with each other in the same community, he proposed removing the community colleges from the university's control. Part of the plan was upgrading the technical schools to colleges, allowing them to award associate's degrees, not just diplomas and certificates. Control of the community and technical colleges would be invested in a new entity, the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Patton believed that severing the community colleges from the University of Kentucky would allow the university to reallocate resources toward becoming a [...] "Top 20" [...] research university in the nation. The plan also charged the University of Louisville with becoming a nationally recognized urban university. The state's Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) would help eliminate duplication of programs among the colleges and oversee the improvements in the state's two major universities. In addition, the CPE was to oversee the formation of a [...] "Commonwealth Virtual University" [...] that would serve as a <b>clearinghouse</b> <b>for</b> all the distance learning opportunities offered by the colleges and universities of Kentucky.

40|$|As the <b>clearinghouses</b> <b>for</b> a {{major portion}} of the world's rapidly {{increasing}} international trade flows, ocean ports and the efficiency with which they process cargo have become an ever more important topic. Yet, there exist very little data that allows one to compare port efficiency measures of any kind across ports and, especially, over time. This paper provides a new statistical method of uncovering port efficiency measures using U. S. Census data on imports into U. S. ports. Unlike previous measures, this study's methodology can provide such estimates for a much broader sample of countries and years with little cost. Thus, such data can be used by future researchers to examine a myriad of new issues, including the evolution of port efficiencies over time and its effects on international trade flows and country-level growth...|$|R

40|$|M. Inf. Users of {{geographic}} information systems (GIS) are often {{faced with a}} challenge with regard to identification, location and overall access to digital data used {{in the application of}} GIS. The selection of the appropriate data from the large volumes available, also gaining access to available data and the establishment of the distribution of data from one central source are necessary tasks in order to improve the dissemination of GIS data. However, these are difficult tasks due to many users being unaware of the full range of available digital GIS data. A mechanism that could assist in improving access to digital GIS data is the Webbased GIS clearinghouse. This study was initiated to determine the requirements of GIS <b>clearinghouses</b> <b>for</b> optimum accessibility to digital GIS data. A literature study was conducted to investigate the nature of data that is used in GIS clearinghouses, the current trends in GIS data on the Web and the unique characteristics of the Web that can increase accessibility to digital GIS data. A selection of clearinghouses was made and these were evaluated in order to determine variables that can be translated into criteria from which a model for the evaluation of GIS clearinghouses could be established. This model can act as a working document or check-list for users to evaluate GIS <b>clearinghouses,</b> or <b>for</b> designers to create new or improve existing GIS clearinghouses...|$|R
