50|$|A <b>combination</b> <b>plate</b> may {{refer to}} a type of {{tableware}} plate, dish or platter that is designed with separate compartments for foods to be placed in.

5000|$|Tex-Mex cuisine is {{characterized}} by its widespread use of melted cheese, meat (particularly beef), beans, and spices, in addition to corn or flour tortillas. Chili con carne, crispy chalupas, chili con queso, enchiladas, and fajitas are all Tex-Mex specialties. A common feature of Tex-Mex is the <b>combination</b> <b>plate,</b> with several of the above on one large platter. Serving tortilla chips and a hot sauce or salsa as an appetizer is also a Tex-Mex development. Cabrito, barbacoa, carne seca, and other products of cattle culture have been common in the ranching cultures of South Texas and northern Mexico. In the 20th century, Tex-Mex took on Americanized elements such as yellow cheese, as goods from the United States became cheap and readily available. Tex-Mex has imported flavors from other spicy cuisines, {{such as the use}} of cumin. Cumin is often referred to by its Spanish name, [...] "comino." ...|$|E

The restaurant was frequented by several Hollywood celebrities, and featured two singing guitarists, who would visit each table and play diners' favorite songs upon request. In addition to Mexican cuisine, the restaurant also had an [...] "American menu," [...] which included such dishes as fried shrimp, steaks, seafood and chicken. According to Cugat, [...] "Marlon Brando loves quesadillas, so he usually has two orders. Paul Newman always orders arroz con pollo, chicken and rice. Dinah Shore is mad about chilled gazpacho. Comedian Steve Martin always orders steak picado. George Burns and Milton Berle both love chile verde. Merv Griffin always orders the Cugat special <b>combination</b> <b>plate.</b> Charo is a fan of the filet of sole fundador. James Caan orders tournedos of beef Diablo.

40|$|Cancellous bone has {{a complex}} {{structure}} consisting of plates and struts with the density {{varies depending on}} the anatomical site. In this study, three idealized architecture were developed based on morphological indices of cancellous bone: the hexagonal, the prismatic and the quadratic crystal shape (QCS). The three architectures were then developed into two types of microstructure, the first consists of struts only and the second consists of a <b>combination</b> of <b>plates</b> and struts. The microstructures were transformed into finite element models and uniaxial compression was applied to all six idealized cancellous models {{as well as on}} the actual cancellous bone specimen obtained from microCT. Contour plots of von Mises stress and displacement were then analysed. Results showed that all models with a <b>combination</b> of <b>plates</b> and struts have higher rigidity compared to the one with struts only. Between the three architectures, the hexagonal was the stiffest among the plates and struts microstructure whilst the prismatic was the most flexible. For the struts microstructure, the hexagonal was found to be the most flexible whilst the prismatic the most stiff. The hexagonal architecture with plates and struts showed similar resemblance to the actual cancellous bone...|$|R

Microstructure, surface morphology and elements of this composite coating were analyzed using SEM, XPS and TEM while phase structure was tested by XRD. The tribological properties of this composite coating were tested by MSTS- 1; Test the preceding tribological properties of Ni/MoS 2 -C composite coatings to the pure Ni/MoS 2 after different period storage at room temperature and 100 % relative humidity atmosphere of 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h {{as well as the}} element of the chemical changes.
