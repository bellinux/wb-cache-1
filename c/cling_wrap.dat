50|$|As {{with many}} other alkenes, 1,1-DCE can be {{polymerised}} to form polyvinylidene chloride. A very widely used product, <b>cling</b> <b>wrap,</b> or Saran was made from this polymer. During the 1990s research suggested that, in common with many chlorinated carbon compounds, Saran posed a possible danger to health by leaching, especially on exposure to food in microwave ovens.

[...] Particular {{applications that}} are {{highlighted by the}} manufacturers include <b>cling</b> <b>wrap</b> for food packaging, compostable plastic bags for gardening and agricultural use, and as water resistant coatings for other materials, as in paper cups. Due to its high flexibility and biodegradable nature, PBAT is also marketed as an additive for more rigid biodegradable plastics to impart flexibility while still maintain full biodegradability of the final blend.|$|E
40|$|A nation wide {{survey of}} the vending {{industry}} indicated that the shelf-life of chilled menu items served from vending machines rarely exceeded 24 hours. This necessitated food production and distribution to vending sites on a daily basis. The short life coupled with unpredictable consumer demand may result in high food wastage rates. Vacuum and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) are known to improve stored raw food quality. In order to optimize the quality and shelf-life of vended foods, {{the effects of these}} techniques and length of storage time on menu items were studied.

Barriers such as thin household <b>cling</b> film, plastic <b>wraps</b> or similar are not acceptable as product quality is not assured. Although some studies appear to show a lower perforation rate, the use of condoms as transducer covers is questionable [53, 54]. Even with dedicated transducer covers, perforation rates appear to be quite high, {{although there is a}} paucity of literature and newer materials may prove to be safer [55 – 57].|$|R

50|$|He became notorious in November 2003 when {{an episode}} of Eating Media Lunch {{featured}} a spoof of the current affairs programme Target, who often would use hidden cameras to catch less than reliable tradepersons or workers. In it, the spoof depicted two actors as Target camera technicians in someone else's home caught on hidden camera in various degrading acts such as masturbation, defecation (on a kitchen stove), injecting and smoking drugs and phone sex. Also, one technician stripped naked and covered himself with <b>cling</b> <b>wrap,</b> and later urinated on the other technician. The spoof attracted several complaints from viewers, however in March 2004 the BSA (Broadcasting Standards Authority) of New Zealand found the episode had not breached any guidelines.|$|E
5000|$|Plastic wrap, {{cling film}} (UK), <b>cling</b> <b>wrap,</b> food wrap, or {{pliofilm}} {{is a thin}} plastic film typically used for sealing food items in containers to keep them fresh {{over a longer period}} of time. Plastic wrap, typically sold on rolls in boxes with a cutting edge, clings to many smooth surfaces and can thus remain tight over the opening of a container without adhesive. Common plastic wrap is roughly 0.5 Thousandth of an inch (12.5 μm) thick. The trend has been to produce thinner plastic wrap, particularly for household use (where very little stretch is needed), so now the majority of brands on shelves around the world are 8, 9 or 10 μm thick.|$|E
50|$|Sheriff Wynan {{returns to}} the station and tells his deputy Pete (Matt L. Jones) to go {{and look for the}} vehicle. Meanwhile, the boys arrive at the woman's trailer. She {{encourages}} them to drink, and after being drugged by the beer, they pass out while undressing. Jared wakes up while being moved in a covered cage. He realizes he is in the sanctuary at Five Points after he identifies Cooper. Cooper begins a long, hate-filled sermon before identifying another captive, a homosexual they lured in through an internet chat room. They bind him to a cross using plastic <b>cling</b> <b>wrap,</b> murder him with a revolver and drop him into a small crawl space where Travis and Billy Ray are bound together.|$|E
50|$|An Australian {{exponent}} of Arte povera, he famously {{developed a}} new mode of Site-specific art at the Mildura Sculpture Triennial in the early 1970s. His most influential work, which was entitled Tree Piece, was made by encasing the trunks of several growing trees {{on the banks of}} the Murray River with, alternately, papier mache, mud, latex, coiled string, plastic <b>cling</b> <b>wrap,</b> and twigs bound together. The impermanent work was then allowed to weather and rot away. It was a breakthrough which lead many sculptors to reconsider the fate of outdoor works, and whether the fabrication of art might in some way adversely impact on the environment. Taking his cues from Aboriginal artifacts, Davis later became chiefly known for tender assembled works made of natural materials, including leaves and twigs, intended to highlight the fragile beauty of nature.|$|E

[...] Aguiari then received a phone call: [...] "Saatchi wants to talk to you," [...] but, on keeping the appointment, she found herself talking not to Charles Saatchi but to Michael Moszynski of the advertising firm, Saatchi & Saatchi, who thought her idea would be suitable for [...] "a Tory advertising campaign," [...] and wanted her to wrap an ambulance in red tape. She declined the offer.|$|E
50|$|Cooper {{then begins}} binding Jared to the cross, but stops when he notices Pete driving {{up to the}} church. Travis and Billy Ray use a {{protruding}} bone from the corpse to cut themselves free, which is heard by Caleb (Ralph Garman). He lifts up the trap door {{just in time to}} see Billy Ray escape and runs after him. Billy Ray is not able to help Travis out of his tight <b>cling</b> <b>wrap</b> cuffs and leaves him for dead. Caleb chases Billy Ray into a room stocked with weapons, where the two shoot each other. Pete hears the gunshots and calls Wynan for back-up, but is shot and killed by Mordechai (James Parks). Cooper then blackmails Wynan, telling him to stay away or he will reveal Wynan's homosexuality to his wife using explicit photos the church has taken of him. In desperation, Wynan calls ATF Agent Joseph Keenan (John Goodman), who begins setting up outside the church.|$|E
50|$|Hiding one's breasts {{is likely}} the most {{challenging}} piece of the gender illusion puzzle for a drag king. While some are small-breasted and may succeed using a tight sports bra, many kings resort {{to one of the}} following, or several of the following used in conjunction with other methods: Ace bandages; duct tape; soft, hard, or ribbed back braces (worn backwards); and compression shirts and vests. Some use a method involving cutting a hole in the crotch of pantyhose for the head and making sleeves out the legs. This creates a tight stocking shirt that compresses the breasts. Duct tape is the most skin damaging method of binding. Prolonged use has resulted, in some cases, of tearing off skin and excessive blister after removal, or stretching of the breast tissue and skin after long-term use. Another damaging binding technique, but more immediately so, is the use of <b>cling</b> <b>wrap.</b> This method has caused Kings to fall unconscious while performing.|$|E
50|$|Made with flour, {{vegetable}} oil, yeast, sugar, salt, {{and water}} (street vendors use Alum {{to make it}} crisper : baking soda, ammonium bicarbonate, alum). Sift dry ingredients together, mix in oil and water. Knead the dough, let it rest in a warm area (in a covered bowl) for 1 hour. Punch down, knead dough. Place in a dusted bowl, covered tightly with <b>cling</b> <b>wrap</b> overnight in refrigerator. The next day, take out the dough and let it rest on your countertop (or warm area) for 2 hours to come to room temperature. On floured board, roll dough to (4 inch x 1/2 inch x 24 inch). Cut the dough into 48 strips, (4 inch x 1/2 inch). Place 48 strips in 24 pairs, {{one on top of}} each other. Heat a wok with about 2 cups oil hot enough for deep frying. Lightly press a joined strip in the lengthwise center with a chopstick, making the impression only immediately before frying, then stretch to 8 inch. Gently lower into hot oil. Turn the strips and push them into the oil so they cook right through and brown evenly. Don’t fry too many at once as the temperature of the oil will drop, the dough will absorb more oil and become greasy. Fry until golden brown and puffy. Remove and drain on rack on paper.|$|E
30|$|Electrospinning {{provides}} an effective method for generating nanofibers from solution of carboxymethyl chitosan/polyoxyethylene oxide (CMCS/PEO). The {{goal of this}} work is to explore the potential application of electrospun CMCS/PEO nanofiber membrane in fruit fresh-keeping. The microstructure, antibacterial activity, hydrophilia, and air permeability of the nanofiber membrane have been tested. For comparison, the fresh-keeping effects of commercial <b>cling</b> <b>wrap</b> and CMCS/PEO nanofiber membranes on strawberries’ rotting rate and weight loss rate have been studied. The {{results indicate that the}} electrospun CMCS/PEO membrane could effectively avoid water loss in strawberries and has a remarkable effect to prolong strawberries’ shelf life due to its breathability and antibacterial activity. In addition, the composite CMCS/PEO, nanofiber membrane is non-poisonous and edible, which can be used in food industry.|$|E
40|$|A {{low-cost}} terahertz beam-splitter is fabricated using ultra-thin LDPE {{plastic sheeting}} {{coated with a}} conducting silver layer. The beam splitting ratio is determined {{as a function of}} the thickness of the silver layer [...] thus any required splitting ratio can be printed on demand with a suitable rapid prototyping technology. The low-cost aspect is a consequence of the fact that ultra-thin LDPE sheeting is readily obtainable, known more commonly as domestic plastic wrap or <b>cling</b> <b>wrap.</b> The proposed beam-splitter has numerous advantages over float zone silicon wafers commonly used within the terahertz frequency range. These advantages include low-cost, ease of handling, ultra-thin thickness, and any required beam splitting ratio can be readily fabricated. Furthermore, as the beam-splitter is ultra-thin, it presents low loss and does not suffer from Fabry-Pérot effects. Measurements performed on manufactured prototypes with different splitting ratios demonstrate a good agreement with our theoretical model in both P and S polarizations, exhibiting nearly frequency-independent splitting ratios in the terahertz frequency range.

40|$|Tempe is a {{processed}} food, {{produced by}} fermenting soybeans with fungus Rhizopus oligosporus. In this study, {{the effects of}} soybean processing (soaking, cooking and fermentation) and packaging (food grade wrapping paper, polyethylene bags and low density polyethylene <b>cling</b> <b>wrap)</b> on physicochemical properties, antioxidant activities and microbial count were evaluated. In addition, shelf life study of tempe samples (packed) was conducted for 1 week. Soaking and cooking significantly decreased polyphenols, flavonoids and antioxidant activities of soybeans. After fermentation, tempe samples exhibited significant improvement in physicochemical properties, antioxidant activities and extractability of polyphenols and flavonoids, when compared with unfermented soybeans. Food grade wrapping paper and perforated polyethylene bags were selected as suitable materials for packaging tempe as {{there were no significant}} changes in quality and the shelf life of tempe was extended for 3 days. Results obtained support the use of fermentation {{to improve the quality of}} soybeans along with safety standards. Practical Applications: Tempe processing and packaging plays an important role in extending the shelf-life of the product. The results of this study suggest that tempe samples exhibited significant improvement in antioxidant activities and extractability of polyphenols and flavonoids, after fermentation. Food grade wrapping paper and perforated polyethylene bags were selected as suitable materials for packaging tempe. This study could serve to improve the progress of processing and packaging for maintaining the quality of tempe...|$|E
40|$|Yalçın, Hüseyin Çağatay (Dogus Author) Understanding the {{relationships}} between genetic and microenvironmental factors that drive normal and malformed embryonic development is fundamental for discovering new therapeutic strategies. Advancements in imaging technology have enabled quantitative investigation of the organization and maturing of the body plan, but later stage embryonic morphogenesis is less clear. Chicken embryos are an attractive vertebrate animal model system for this application because of its ease of culture and surgical manipulation. Early embryos can be cultured {{for a short time}} on filter paper rings, which enables complete optical access for cell patterning and fate studies. Studying advanced developmental processes such as cardiac morphogenesis are traditionally performed through a window of the eggshell, but this technique limits optical access due to window size. We previously developed a simple method to culture whole embryos ex-ovo on hexagonal weigh boats for up to 10 days, which enabled high resolution imaging via ultrasonography. These cultures were difficult to transport, limiting the types of imaging tools available for live experiments. We here present an improved shell-less culture system with a cost-effective, portable environmental chamber. Eggs were cracked onto a hammock created by a polyurethane membrane (<b>cling</b> <b>wrap)</b> affixed circumferentially to a plastic cup partially filled with sterile water. The dimensions of the circumference and depth of the hammock were both critical to maintain surface tension, while the mechanics of the hammock and water beneath helped dampen vibrations induced by transportation. A small footprint circulating water bath was also developed to enable continuous temperature control during experimentation. We demonstrate the ability to culture embryos in this way for at least 14 days without morphogenic defect or delay and employ this system in several microsurgical and imaging applications...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{deterioration}} of concrete in South Africa is becoming of major {{concern to the}} construction industry. The maintenance of reinforced concrete structures is an extremely expensive exercise and is a continuing necessity. Concrete curing is a practice that is understood to be a necessity within industry, but is often overlooked {{as a result of}} time and/or economic constraints. The objective of the study is to ascertain whether or not the implementation of better quality and alternative curing techniques will improve the durability properties of the concrete. Curing is defined as the maintenance of appropriate moisture and temperature conditions to permit the continuation of the hydration or pozzolanic reaction. The objective of curing is to ensure the progress of hydration reactions causing the filling and discontinuity of capillary voids by hydrated compounds in newly placed concrete. Modern curing methods are generally classified as wet or sealing. Wet methods include fogging, sprinkling, ponding, immersion and wet coverings. Sealing methods include plastic coverings and membrane forming curing compounds. Crystallising permeability reducing admixtures may be included in the concrete mix design in order to decrease the penetrability of concrete by decreasing the interconnectivity of the pore structure. Curing methods need to be employed in order to assure specified durability limits are acquired, as durability constraints are implemented in industry. Various methods of curing were tested in order to establish the effect of the techniques on the durability properties of concrete. Samples were placed in water and in winter (Western Cape, South Africa) and simulated summer environments. Various curing techniques were then employed within each of the exposure environments. The curing methods were damp hessian, <b>cling</b> <b>wrap,</b> two curing compounds and two crystallising permeability reducers (PRA's). Samples were also left untreated in each environment as reference samples. Compressive strength, oxygen permeability, water sorptivity, chloride conductivity, bulk diffusion and accelerated carbonation tests were conducted. The results obtained in the study concur with those presented in literature. Prolonged periods of moist curing are significantly beneficial to the compressive strength and durability properties of concrete, however, full water immersion is not a feasible alternative for large or insitu-cast concrete elements. Results of the study show that d amp hessian was the best method to ensure superior durability properties. The sealing of samples with curing compounds in a cool and wet environment (winter) is not recommended, whereas it is marginally beneficial, as was clingwrap, in a hot and dry environment (summer). The crystallising PRA's provided mixed results and were favourable where excess moisture was available and fairly ineffective in dry conditions. The durability properties of concrete are markedly affected by the curing technique implemented...|$|E
