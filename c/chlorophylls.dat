40|$|AbstractChlorophyll a and <b>chlorophyll</b> b are {{the major}} {{constituents}} of the photosynthetic apparatus in land plants and green algae. <b>Chlorophyll</b> a is essential in photochemistry, while <b>chlorophyll</b> b is apparently dispensable for their photosynthesis. Instead, <b>chlorophyll</b> b is necessary for stabilizing the major light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins. <b>Chlorophyll</b> b is synthesized from <b>chlorophyll</b> a and is catabolized after it is reconverted to <b>chlorophyll</b> a. This interconversion system between <b>chlorophyll</b> a and <b>chlorophyll</b> b refers to the <b>chlorophyll</b> cycle. The <b>chlorophyll</b> b levels {{are determined by the}} activity of the three enzymes participating in the <b>chlorophyll</b> cycle, namely, chlorophyllide a oxygenase, <b>chlorophyll</b> b reductase, and 7 -hydroxymethyl-chlorophyll reductase. This article reviews the recent progress on the analysis of the <b>chlorophyll</b> cycle and its enzymes. In particular, we emphasize the impact of genetic modification of <b>chlorophyll</b> cycle enzymes on the construction and destruction of the photosynthetic machinery. These studies reveal that plants regulate the construction and destruction of a specific subset of light-harvesting complexes through the <b>chlorophyll</b> cycle. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Regulation of Electron Transport in Chloroplasts...|$|R
50|$|<b>Chlorophyll</b> c can {{be further}} divided into <b>chlorophyll</b> c1, <b>chlorophyll</b> c2 and <b>chlorophyll</b> c3, plus at least 8 other more-recently-found subtypes.|$|R
25|$|Chlorophyll b is {{an olive}} green pigment {{found only in}} the chloroplasts of plants, green algae, any {{secondary}} chloroplasts obtained through the secondary endosymbiosis of a green alga, and a few cyanobacteria. It is the <b>chlorophylls</b> a and b together that make most plant and green algal chloroplasts green.|$|E
25|$|Several other heterocycles {{are related}} to porphyrins. These include corrins, chlorins, bacteriochlorophylls, and corphins. Chlorins (2,3-dihydroporphyrin) are more reduced, contain more {{hydrogen}} than porphyrins, i.e. one pyrrole has been converted to a pyrroline. This structure occurs in <b>chlorophylls.</b> Replacement {{of two of the}} four pyrrolic subunits with pyrrolinic subunits results in either a bacteriochlorin (as found in some photosynthetic bacteria) or an isobacteriochlorin, depending on the relative positions of the reduced rings. Some porphyrin derivatives follow Hückel's rule, but most do not.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>chlorophylls,</b> {{another group of}} yellow–orange pigments called carotenoids are {{also found in the}} photosystems. There are about thirty photosynthetic carotenoids. They help transfer and dissipate excess energy, and their bright colors sometimes override the chlorophyll green, like during the fall, when the leaves of some land plants change color. β-carotene is a bright red-orange carotenoid found in nearly all chloroplasts, like chlorophyll a. Xanthophylls, especially the orange-red zeaxanthin, are also common. Many other forms of carotenoids exist that are only found in certain groups of chloroplasts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorophyll</b> content tests {{work because}} leaf {{nitrogen}} content and <b>chlorophyll</b> concentration are closely linked, {{which would be}} expected since the majority of leaf nitrogen is contained in <b>chlorophyll</b> molecules. <b>Chlorophyll</b> content can be detected with a <b>Chlorophyll</b> content meter; a portable instrument that measures the greenness of leaves to estimate their relative <b>chlorophyll</b> concentration.|$|R

50|$|This enzyme {{carries out}} {{the first step in}} the {{conversion}} of <b>chlorophyll</b> b to <b>chlorophyll</b> a.

25|$|These photosystems are light-driven redox centers, each {{consisting}} of an antenna complex that uses <b>chlorophylls</b> and accessory photosynthetic pigments such as carotenoids and phycobiliproteins to harvest light {{at a variety}} of wavelengths. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by resonance energy transfer to a specialized chlorophyll a at the reaction center of each photosystem. When either of the two chlorophyll a molecules at the reaction center absorbs energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule. Photosystem I contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules, designated P700, at its reaction center that maximally absorbs 700nm light. Photosystem II contains P680 chlorophyll that absorbs 680nm light best (note that these wavelengths correspond to deep red – see the visible spectrum). The P is short for pigment and the number is the specific absorption peak in nanometers for the chlorophyll molecules in each reaction center.|$|E
25|$|The first {{measurements}} of photoinhibition {{were published in}} 1956 by Bessel Kok. Even {{in the very first}} studies, it was obvious that plants have a repair mechanism that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage. In 1966, Jones and Kok measured the action spectrum of photoinhibition and found that ultraviolet light is highly photoinhibitory. The visible-light part of the action spectrum was found to have a peak in the red-light region, suggesting that <b>chlorophylls</b> act as photoreceptors of photoinhibition. In the 1980s, photoinhibition became a popular topic in photosynthesis research, and the concept of a damaging reaction counteracted by a repair process was re-invented. Research was stimulated by a paper by Kyle, Ohad and Arntzen in 1984, showing that photoinhibition is accompanied by selective loss of a 32-kDa protein, later identified as the PSII reaction center protein D1. The photosensitivity of PSII from which the oxygen evolving complex had been inactivated with chemical treatment was studied in the 1980s and early 1990s. A paper by Imre Vass and coworkers in 1992 described the acceptor-side mechanism of photoinhibition. species promote chlorophyll triplet formation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|volume=89| year=1992|pages=14081412 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.4.1408|issue = 4}} Measurements of production of singlet oxygen by photoinhibited PSII provided further evidence for an acceptor-side-type mechanism. The concept of a repair cycle that continuously repairs photoinhibitory damage, evolved and was reviewed by Aro et al. in 1993. Many details of the repair cycle, including the finding that the FtsH protease {{plays an important role in}} the degradation of the D1 protein, have been discovered since. In 1996, a paper by Tyystjärvi and Aro showed that the rate constant of photoinhibition is directly proportional to light intensity, a result that opposed the former assumption that photoinhibition is caused by the fraction of light energy that exceeds the maximum capability of photosynthesis. The following year, laser pulse photoinhibition experiments done by Itzhak Ohad's group led to the suggestion that charge recombination reactions may be damaging because they can lead to production of singlet oxygen. The molecular mechanism(s) of photoinhibition are constantly under discussion. The newest candidate is the manganese mechanism suggested 2005 by the group of Esa Tyystjärvi. A similar mechanism was suggested by the group of Norio Murata, also in 2005.|$|E
500|$|In 1903 <b>Chlorophylls</b> a and b were {{separated}} by thin layer chromatography then, through the 1920s and 1930s, biochemists, notably Hans Krebs (1900–1981) and Carl (1896–1984) and Gerty Cori (1896–1957) began tracing out the central metabolic pathways of life. Between the 1930s and 1950s {{it was determined that}} ATP, located in mitochondria, was the source of cellular chemical energy and the constituent reactions of photosynthesis were progressively revealed. Then, in 1944 DNA was extracted for the first time. Along with these revelations there was the discovery of plant hormones or [...] "growth substances", notably auxins, (1934) gibberellins (1934) and cytokinins (1964) and the effects of photoperiodism, the control of plant processes, especially flowering, by the relative lengths of day and night.|$|E
40|$|Cucumber {{seedlings}} were illuminated {{for various}} time periods, cotyledons excised, {{placed in the}} dark, and changes in <b>chlorophyll</b> a and b content monitored. During the dark periods, <b>chlorophyll</b> b content decreased while <b>chlorophyll</b> a did not. When the illumination time was lengthened, the percentage of <b>chlorophyll</b> b decomposition from initial levels decreased. Ca 2 + at 50 millimolar prevented the decrease in <b>chlorophyll</b> b and caused a decrease in <b>chlorophyll</b> a. The effect of Ca 2 + decreased with increased illumination time. Cycloheximide and chloramphenicol inhibited <b>chlorophyll</b> b decrease, but did not induce <b>chlorophyll</b> a decrease...|$|R
40|$|In the <b>chlorophyll</b> cycle, <b>chlorophyll</b> b is {{synthesized}} from <b>chlorophyll</b> a (forward reaction) by chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO) and <b>chlorophyll</b> b is reconverted to <b>chlorophyll</b> a (backward reaction) by <b>chlorophyll</b> b reductase (NOL, NYC 1) and 7 -hydroxyl <b>chlorophyll</b> a reductase (HCAR). Activity of {{the forward}} and backward reactions alters the levels of <b>chlorophyll</b> a and <b>chlorophyll</b> b which {{is associated with the}} changes of <b>chlorophyll</b> a/b ratio. The level of light harvesting complexes, which forms the antenna of photosystem II (PSII), is primarily regulated by the <b>chlorophyll</b> cycle. Stabilization of light harvesting <b>chlorophyll</b> a/b binding protein complexes (LHCII) is corelated with accumulation of <b>chlorophyll</b> b indicating that LHCII formation is regulated by <b>chlorophyll</b> b synthesis. In contrast, degradation of <b>chlorophyll</b> b is the initial step of LHCII degradation during senescence, indicating that <b>chlorophyll</b> b degradation regulates the degradation of LHCII. This study aimed to clarify the regulation mechanisms of the formation and degradation of LHCs by the <b>chlorophyll</b> cycle. In the first part, I examined detail of LHCII formation and its effect on the structure and stoichiometry of both photosystems when <b>chlorophyll</b> b synthesis was triggered by the expression of the full length CAO in the Arabidopsis <b>chlorophyll</b> b less mutant ch 1 - 1. Out results show that accompanied with biosynthesis of <b>chlorophyll</b> b, LHCs apoproteins were accumulated. Formation of LHCII trimer was associated to the core antenna of PSII to form PSII-LHCII supercomplexes. Peripheral antenna of photosystem I (PSI) and II increased after <b>chlorophyll</b> b synthesis. I also found that PSI/PSII ratio was altered accompanied by the synthesis of <b>chlorophyll</b> b. In the second part, I examined the effect of <b>chlorophyll</b> b on the accumulation NYC 1 which is responsible for the degradation of LHCII during leaf senescence. In this study, I introduced BC domain of CAO fused with GFP into Arabidopsis mutant ch 1 - 1, 5 which was named BCG plant, in which <b>chlorophyll</b> b was over-produced. Analysis of my results show that NYC 1 was over-accumulated in BCG plant, but not in ch 1 - 1 after dark incubation; however, the mRNA level increased in both BCG and ch 1 - 1 after dark incubation.

30|$|The {{decrement}} {{in total}} <b>chlorophyll</b> (which here mainly refers to <b>chlorophyll</b> a and <b>chlorophyll</b> b) {{was observed in}} the negative control group, but {{with the addition of}} ferulic acid, the proportion of total <b>chlorophyll</b> was recovered, especially <b>chlorophyll</b> a. The content of total <b>chlorophyll</b> reflects the plant growth state in a certain sense. Under adversities, such as drought, salinity, low temperature, pollution, or element deficiency, the content and composition of <b>chlorophyll</b> will be severely affected as the structure of <b>chlorophyll</b> is unstable (Hörtensteiner and Kräutler 2011). The serious decrease in <b>chlorophyll</b> content in the presence of DMSO is further proof of our previous hypothesis that the DMSO will negatively affect microalgal growth and activity. Moreover, we found that the ratio of <b>chlorophyll</b> a to <b>chlorophyll</b> b in the negative control group was also lower than that of the control group. This might be attributed to inhibition in the synthesis of <b>chlorophyll</b> a under stress or the conversion of <b>chlorophyll</b> a into <b>chlorophyll</b> b (Folly and Engel 1999). With increasing ferulic acid concentrations, the <b>chlorophyll</b> content was greatly improved to much higher than that of the two control groups, meaning that the environmental stress and restriction of <b>chlorophyll</b> synthesis were alleviated and cells could capture more light for their growth. It is reasonable that ferulic acid enhances the capacity of E. gracilis cells for utilizing the light source, resulting in a greater cell length and more vigorous growth.|$|R

In the presence of air, δ-aminolevulinic acid, coenzyme A, glutathione, potassium phosphate, methyl alcohol, magnesium, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and adenosine triphosphate, microgram quantities of <b>chlorophyll</b> accumulated after 1 hour of incubation. Part of the <b>chlorophyll</b> was not extractable in organic solvents; it {{is referred to as}} bound <b>chlorophyll.</b> The amount of bound <b>chlorophyll</b> depended on the degree of cotyledon greening at the time of plastid isolation. Etioplasts with or without a lag phase of <b>chlorophyll</b> biosynthesis synthesized nonphototransformable protochlorophyll and smaller amounts of extractable <b>chlorophyll.</b> As the greening of excised cotyledons progressed, more of the <b>chlorophyll</b> became bound before and after in vitro incubation.

2500|$|As befits {{the large}} {{diversity}} of photosynthetic bacteria, {{there are many}} different mechanisms by which light is converted into energy for metabolism. [...] All photosynthetic organisms locate their photosynthetic reaction centers [...] within a membrane, which may be invaginations of the cytoplasmic membrane (Proteobacteria), thylakoid membranes (Cyanobacteria), specialized antenna structures called chlorosomes (Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), or the cytoplasmic membrane itself (heliobacteria). [...] Different photosynthetic bacteria also contain different photosynthetic pigments, such as <b>chlorophylls</b> and carotenoids, allowing them to take advantage of different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum and thereby inhabit different niches.
