40|$|The {{uncertain}} and competitive {{nature of the}} wine industry coupled with increasing capital investments suggests that analytic techniques {{may be useful in}} supporting judgmental decision making processes to determine product mixes and harvesting procedures. Using existing operations research methods, we attempt to formulate a stochastic mathematical model that enables winemakers and vineyard managers to make practical and informed decisions with respect to the questions of “when, where, what and how much”. A constant source of difficulty for operations researchers in modeling constrained optimization “real life” problems is uncertainty. Gathering data about the inherent uncertainty in real-life problems is at best an inexact science. The resulting data is often incomplete and fraught with noise. Applications to the wine producing industry are no different. There are many issues to be dealt with in an optimization model including the amounts of grapes harvested, from which block they are harvested, the day they are harvested, the mode of harvesting and the destination of harvesting. In addition to the vineyard manager’s role, the winemaker provides information as to the effect of the time and the quality of wine that can be produced if grapes are picked at a certain time as well as the price. Current emphasis on solving constrained optimization models in the literature allows for preferences/risk aversion to mitigate uncertainty in the model. To address this complex yet ambiguous <b>canva...</b>|$|E
40|$|Dye lasers {{are widely}} used, since {{they can be}} {{operated}} in pulsed or continuous manner and cover a large spectral range from the ultraviolet to the near infrared (using different dyes). However, laser dyes are usually used in liquid form thereby imposing restrictions on the laser design such {{as the need for}} a pumping system, reservoirs, etc. Hence the search for solid-state dye lasers with competitive lifetimes and efficiencies constitutes an active research field. The main approach is to embed the laser dye into a suitable matrix. The basic requirements imposed on the solid matrix are high optical quality with a low level of scattering and a wide range of transparency covering both pump and lasing wavelength. In addition a high damage threshold to laser radiation and good thermal and photochemical stability are required. Xerogels and aerogels have been used for this purpose for several years now and much progress has been achieved (see e. g. [1, 2]). We have prepared silica xerogels by a standard procedure using tetra-ethylorthosilicate, ethanole, and hyrdochloric acid. The laser dye (Rhodamine 6 G) was dissolved in ethanole and added to the solution at various concentrations. After gelation the gels were dried in air for 2 days at 50 C. The luminescence properties of the such prepared solid state dye hybrids were investigated by steady state and time resolved spectroscopy and compared to those of a solution of Rhodamine 6 G in methanole. We observe a slight blue shift in the luminescence maximum from about 590 nm in methanol to about 570 nm in the hybrids. The luminescence lifetime of Rhodamine 6 G after pulsed excitation with 470 nm wavelength is about 5. 8 ns, both in the methanol solution and in the prepared dye hybrids.

40|$|The {{world was}} a very {{different}} place in December 1999 when the first G 20 met in Berlin. Steve Jobs had just taken back the reins at Apple, but Facebook, Google, Twitter and the dot-com bust were figments of imagination. When government and central banking leaders meet in Brisbane this week, they will have a very different set of concerns, as well as a different set of levers to achieve the goal of “stable and sustainable world growth that benefits all". The path of least resistance is to make small adjustments in an effort to re-balance and re-ignite growth. Instead, they should be considering how to stimulate and harness the power of digital disruption to create companies that can grow fast and create jobs we can not even imagine. The continued growth of the start-up culture and the “overnight” success of new businesses such as Uber, AirBnb and Dropbox demonstrate the economies of tomorrow are being shaped by companies which have became global players overnight. Rather than focusing on a few adjustments to re-stabilise the world’s economy, the G 20 leaders need to understand the impact of digital disruptions on nations and industries. All will be impacted; none will be spared. Deloitte Digital’s latest report, “Harnessing the bang”, identifies some of the impacts of this “digital disruption” to existing companies. It notes that 13 industries comprising 65 % of the Australian economy are facing significant disruption by 2017. Google, for example, has revolutionised advertising, Amazon has re-invented the book publishing industry, streaming services like Netflix have changed the movie and entertainment sector, and internet banking has changed financial services. It’s clear this is a worldwide phenomenon, not just one facing Australia. Digital disruption belongs on the G 20 agenda. Threat or opportunity? As ancient Chinese wisdom says, every threat contains the seeds of opportunity. The democratisation of markets brought about by the rise of technology represents boundless opportunities for companies that are innovative. Henry Ford heard people say they wanted to travel faster, but instead of breeding a faster horse, he used new technology to create a motorised vehicle – and a manufacturing industry no one had imagined. Automobiles disrupted traditional modes of transportation and required workers to have new manufacturing skills. New companies were born and new hard infrastructure required: roads, bridges. The same is happening with digital technology. The digital products and services require new skills, will generate new companies and need a different kind of infrastructure to support them (broadband internet, global paths to market, venture funding etc.) Australia has some great start-up success stories: Atlassian provides software to the software makers all over the world, and <b>Canva</b> is reaching 1, 000, 000 customers. Both are carving a global path to success in their particular industries. The G 20 Global Café in Brisbane will showcase several more companies that are digital disruptors of traditional industries, are already going global and have the potential to grow big. Some are concerned that tech companies don’t create jobs – they underestimate the impact that tech start-ups have on wealth and job creation. The IPOs of Google, Facebook and Twitter together created nearly 4, 000 millionaires. As for job growth, high-tech companies create a disproportionate share of high-value jobs. Between 2002 and 2008, for example, 6 % of UK businesses with the highest growth rates created 50 % of the new jobs. Professor Enrico Moretti, an economics professor at UC Berkeley, notes that for every job a tech company creates, five new jobs are created in other sectors – a multiplier effect three times higher than for extractive or traditional manufacturing industries. The focus should be start up, then grow up So it’s pretty simple: entrepreneurs whose businesses use digital technology to develop or deliver products and services that customers need and want will grow the fastest, create the most jobs and have the highest probability of success. This in turn has numerous economic benefits for countries that encourage and foster an entrepreneurial mindset and a high-tech-friendly environment. Smart governments that have already figured this out are beginning to provide resources and support their start-up ecosystems. From science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) and entrepreneurial education, through to direct government funding at the venture capital stage, they are placing a premium on developing more high-growth technology companies, teaching CEOs how to start and grow companies, and removing the barriers to growth. So what does Australia, in particular, need to do to create the environment in which our digital disruptors can quickly become high-growth, global players? It’s pretty simple: 1) Encourage more people to start companies and make jobs, not just take a job. Teach people the entrepreneurial mindset and support those who see opportunities and want to start and grow companies. 2) Provide more funding for research and education, especially in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). 3) Revamp systems that support the commercialisation of research with the goal of developing more technology companies. 4) Support the development of an ecosystem that provides entrepreneurs with what they need to grow companies: access to knowledge, talent, money and space. 5) Have a workforce ready and able to work in companies that make widespread use of technology. 6) Help existing businesses adapt to the world of digital disruption. The Australian government is beginning to understand that the future must include high-growth technology companies, as well as mining, gas and agriculture. It is beginning to engage with bodies such as StartupAUS (of which I am a board member). We are hopeful that the Department of Industry’s Entrepreneurs Infrastructure Program and additional programs will spur the development of more venture capital and more disruptive technology companies in Australia. The G 20 countries need to understand the power of digital disruption and develop economic and financial policies that actually capitalise on that disruption. Creative destruction of old industries is the norm; the internet is an accelerant to the pace of disruption. Innovation, digital disruption and entrepreneurship are not passing fads – they are the solution to the economic problems we are experiencing. Countries that understand this and develop polices and programs to support it will benefit the whole world...|$|E
