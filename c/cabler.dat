5000|$|Tribune Broadcasting {{announced}} that its 42 television stations in 33 markets and basic cable network WGN America were pulled from Dish Network on June 12 at 7 p.m. (Eastern) {{after the two}} sides failed to reach a new retransmission agreement. This affected 7 markets where the 70th Annual Tony Awards were airing on CBS affiliates (including WHNT-TV in Huntsville, AL; KFSM-TV in Fort Amith, AR; WTTV in Bloomington, IN; and 5 others) that same evening {{an hour after the}} previous retransmission contract ended. This also impacts major market CW affiliates KDAF in Dallas, KIAH in Houston, WPIX in New York City, KTLA in Los Angeles, and Tribune's flagship WGN-TV in Chicago (which switched to being an independent station on September 1). Dish proposed having an arbitrator to settle the dispute. Meanwhile, Tribune proposed to have the FCC chairman monitor negotiations between the two companies. [...] As the blackout reached its 2nd week, Dish sues Tribune over their [...] "Dump Dish" [...] campaign, accusing them of deceptive claims about worst customer service and hindering contracts with its customers, damaging the provider's good reputation. Tribune responded to said lawsuit calling it [...] "frivolous", and stated that they [...] "repeatedly offered Dish an extension through August 31, 2016, which Dish has continually rejected." [...] Throughout this spat, Dish customers in markets affected also missed out on Games 5, 6, and 7 of a historic 2016 NBA Finals and Game 6 of the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals on Tribune-owned ABC and NBC affiliates respectively. Dish Chairman and CEO Charlie Ergen said that the satellite distributor is prepared for the long-haul, adding that if necessary he could do without the channels indefinitely. Ergen also states that the longer this dispute continues, the less valuable the Tribune stations and <b>cabler</b> WGN America will be. As the blackout continued through August, customers in affected markets already missed NBC's coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics in its entirety on its Tribune-owned affiliates, although NBC's sister cable networks were also showing select events. They also missed most of the NFL Preseason games on its CBS and Fox affiliates.|$|E

40|$|Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) is an {{advanced}} composite material with advantages of high strength and light weight, giving it great {{potential to be}} a new, reliable <b>cable</b> material. Ideal structures for CFRP <b>cables</b> are orthogonally loaded <b>cable</b> structures, where <b>cables</b> are loaded orthogonally or approximately orthogonally by external loads. Using CFRP <b>cables</b> in such structures, e. g. <b>cable</b> roofs and <b>cable</b> facades, has advantages over traditional steel <b>cable</b> structures. In order to demonstrate this point, two typical orthogonally loaded <b>cable</b> structures, i. e. a CFRP spoked wheel <b>cable</b> roof and a CFRP <b>cable</b> net façade, were investigated in a case study.
