Dean Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot.|$|E

The Bamum ethnic group of the West Region is largely Muslim. Native traditional religions are practiced in rural areas throughout the <b>country</b> <b>but</b> rarely are practiced publicly in cities, in part because many indigenous religious groups are intrinsically local in character.|$|E
5|$|Non-governmental organisations {{began to}} move back into the <b>country,</b> <b>but</b> the {{international}} community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime, and most international aid was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions among Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.|$|E
