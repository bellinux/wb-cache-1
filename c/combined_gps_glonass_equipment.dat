40|$|Summary. The most {{effective}} approaches for evolutionary identifying dynamical processes depend on iterative trial-error searches in a hierarchical fashion: a new structureisproposedfirst;then,itssetofparametersisnumericallydetermined, {{and the process}} is repeated until a model accurate enough is found. Canonical Genetic Programming {{has been used to}} automate this search; but its output can be difficult to interpret. Because of this reason, the use of hierarchical learning methods, that <b>combine</b> <b>GP</b> search of structures with deterministic optimization algorithms, has been proposed. We will show in this paper that the output of such methods can be further improved with non hierarchical algorithms. In particular, we will show that the use of GA-P improves the interpretability of the models and does a better model search than previous approaches...|$|R

Methods: 110 patients with Ⅲb-Ⅳ stage non-small cell lung cancer who were treated in Navy General Hospital between July 2013 and August 2016 were collected and divided into the control group (n= 58) who received conventional GP chemotherapy and the observation group (n= 52) who received percutaneous radiofrequency ablation <b>combined</b> with <b>GP</b> chemotherapy after the therapies were reviewed. Serum levels of tumor markers, angiogenesis indexes and adhesion molecules before and after treatment were compared between two groups of patients. Results: Before treatment, the differences in serum levels of tumor markers, angiogenesis indexes and adhesion molecules were not statistically significant between two groups of patients. After treatment, serum levels of tumor markers Cyfra 21 - 1, ProGRP, SCC-Ag and CA 125 in observation group were lower than those in control group; serum levels of angiogenesis indexes IGF- 1, bFGF, EGFR and TF were lower than those in control group; serum levels of adhesion molecules sICAM- 1 and sVCAM- 1 were lower than those in control group.

Four combinations of time frames stretching further into the past are examined. Two different decision mechanisms for evaluating the overall signal given the GP signals over all time frames are also examined, one based on majority vote and another based on temporal proximity to the buying decision.

40|$|Genetic Programming (GP) and Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) have {{received}} increasing interest recently. Since their formalisms are so different, these two approaches cannot be integrated easily though they share many common goals and functionalities.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel formulation of motion planning, for continuous-time trajectories, as probabilistic inference. We first show how smooth continuous-time trajectories {{can be represented}} by {{a small number of}} states using sparse Gaussian process (GP) models. We next develop an efficient gradient-based optimization algorithm that exploits this sparsity and Gaussian process interpolation. We call this algorithm the Gaussian Process Motion Planner (GPMP). We then detail how motion planning problems can be formulated as probabilistic inference on a factor graph. This forms the basis for GPMP 2, a very efficient algorithm that <b>combines</b> <b>GP</b> representations of trajectories with fast, structure-exploiting inference via numerical optimization. Finally, we extend GPMP 2 to an incremental algorithm, iGPMP 2, that can efficiently replan when conditions change. We benchmark our algorithms against several sampling-based and trajectory optimization-based motion planning algorithms on planning problems in multiple environments. Our evaluation reveals that GPMP 2 is several times faster than previous algorithms while retaining robustness. We also benchmark iGPMP 2 on replanning problems, and show that it can find successful solutions in a fraction of the time required by GPMP 2 to replan from scratch...|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine whether this increase arises through an increase in peripheral or central chemosensitivity. Ten healthy volunteers each underwent 8 -h exposures to 1) isocapnic hypoxia, with end-tidal PO 2 (PET(O 2)) = 55 Torr and end-tidal PCO 2 (PET(CO 2)) = eucapnia; 2) poikilocapnic hypoxia, with PET(O 2) = 55 Torr and PET(CO 2) = uncontrolled; and 3) air-breathing control. The ventilatory response to CO 2 was measured before and after each exposure with the use of a multifrequency binary sequence with two levels of PET(CO 2) : 1. 5 and 10 Torr above the normal resting value. PET(O 2) was held at 250 Torr. The peripheral (Gp) and the central (Gc) sensitivities were calculated by fitting the ventilatory data to a two-compartment model. There were increases in <b>combined</b> <b>Gp</b> + Gc (26 %, P < 0. 05), Gp (33 %, P < 0. 01), and Gc (23 %, P = not significant) after exposure to hypoxia.

Although Korean shipyards have accumulated {{a great amount of}} data, they do not have appropriate tools to utilize the data in practical works. Most of shipyards utilize empirical formulas for the prediction of design parameters in preliminary design stage. But these formulas generated from past existing ship data are old-fashioned, so it is not adequate to apply the formulas to new ship design for the prediction of parameters. This paper presents a machine learning method based on genetic programming (GP), which {{can be one of the}} components for the realization of data mining. Differing from neural network model which is black box, user cannot perceive the predicted formula, GP can be seen. Users can use the generated formula in real design system. In practical cases, we don’t have enough learning samples, but there are many design input parameters. Therefore, reducing the number of input parameters is essential. In order to reducing the number of input parameters, self organizing map (SOM) is adopted. By applying SOM to accumulated data, the influence of input parameters on design outputs can be found.

In this paper {{we examine the}} application of geographic profiling techniques to an organized group of individuals, such as drug dealers and insurgents; in particular, tackling the problem of predicting which facilities in an urban area might support clandestine activities such as drug processing or bomb making. GP techniques assume a single perpetrator whose only observable actions are punctuated killings. In contrast, clandestine organizations involve several distributed individuals who communicate, coordinate, make plans, and execute. Most of their actions, potentially observable such as phone calls, are seemingly innocuous.

We then discuss approaches to fuse all information into a predictive model for each group. This model estimates the risk of future activity based on current observations of group presence. This estimated risk is used to generate actionable products such as security force search paths and prioritization of intelligence collection requests.

40|$|Background In {{previous}} systematic reviews, predominantly of randomised controlled trials, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) {{has been}} shown to reduce hospital admissions for acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). However, findings have been less consistent for cohort studies. We aimed to compare rates of hospitalized and general practice (GP) treated AECOPD before and after PR. Methods Using anonymised data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics, hospital admissions and GP visits for AECOPD were compared one year before and after PR in patients referred for PR. Exacerbation rates were also compared between individuals eligible and referred for PR with those eligible and not referred. Results 69, 089 (64 %) of the COPD patients in the cohort were eligible for PR. Of these, only 6, 436 (9. 3 %) were recorded as having been referred for rehabilitation. 62, 019 (89. 8 %) were not referred and 634 (0. 98 %) declined referral. When <b>combining</b> <b>GP</b> and hospital exacerbations, people who were eligible and were referred for PR had a slightly higher but not statistically significant exacerbation rate (2. 83 exacerbations/patient-year 95 % CI: 2. 66, 3. 00) than those who were eligible but not referred (2. 17 exacerbations/patient-year 95 % CI: 2. 11, 2. 24). Conclusions This study found that less than 10 % of patients who were eligible for PR were actually referred.

The cellular immunity (CD 3 ＋, CD 4 ＋, CD 8 ＋, CD 16 ＋CD 56 ＋) and humoral immunity (IgG, IgA, IgM, C 3, C 4) before and after chemotherapy were tested by flow cytometry (FCM) and biochemical method, respectively. The influences of two treatment methods on the immune function were compared, and clinical efficacy was evaluated. Results: The remission rates (RRs) were respectively 40. 3 % and 36. 5 % in treatment group and control group, without statistical difference (P ＞ 0. 05). Compared with chemotherapy before, the cellular immune function after chemotherapy decreased in control group (P ＜ 0. 05),whereas the levels of CD 3 ＋, CD 4 ＋, CD 4 ＋ /CD 8 ＋ and CD 16 ＋ CD 56 ＋ increased significantly in treatment group (P ＜ 0. 05 or P ＜ 0. 01).

With its flexible tree-structured representation, GP {{is a type of}} Genetic Algorithm, using the Darwinian idea of natural selection and genetic recombination, evolving populations of solutions over many generations to solve problems. SL is a common approach in Machine Learning where the problem is presented as a set of examples. A good or fit solution is one which can successfully deal with all of the examples. In common with most Machine Learning approaches, GP has been used to solve many trivial problems. When applied to larger and more complex problems, however, several difficulties become apparent. When focusing on the basic features of GP, this thesis highlights the immense size of the GP search space, and describes an approach to measure this space. A stupendously flexible but frustratingly useless representation, Anarchically Automatically Defined Functions, is described. Some difficulties associated with the normal use of the GP operator Crossover (perhaps the most common method of <b>combining</b> <b>GP</b> trees to produce new trees) are demonstrated in the simple MAX problem. Crossover can lead to irreversible sub-optimal GP performance when used in combination with a restriction on tree size.

The main contributions of this thesis however are two approaches for avoiding the fitness evaluation bottleneck resulting from the use of SL in GP. to establish the capability of a GP individual using SL, it must be tested or evaluated against each example in the set of training examples...|$|R

This thesis {{considers}} {{the application of}} Genetic Programming (GP) to create computer programs that can solve both classification and metamaterial design problems {{in the area of}} electromagnetics (EM). Specifically, GP is used to develop an automatic target classification algorithm and is combined with the patterning Lindenmayer system {{for the development of a}} metamaterial design program. For both studies, GP is compared to other popular artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in each area such as the Neural Networks (NN) and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods. It is shown that Genetic Programming provides improved classification results and when applied to design work leads to unconventional and global optimal solutions. In the target classification of buried objects it is desired to develop an accurate and reliable analysis and classification of electromagnetic data for buried unexploded ordnance (UXO) discrimination. The classification of this data is vital to not only clear buried UXO leftover from war and military training areas across the world with minimal false alarm rates but also to provide opportunities to use this land for housing and business development. GP is compared with neural networks, a popular classification technique, for the classification of UXO scattering patterns. Three classification scenarios with various levels of difficulty were examined and in all cases GP outperformed the NNs. For the metamaterial design study, a GP program was developed that generates novel, efficient, and unintuitive "broadband" metamaterial designs. There has been no established methodology for developing a successful design of ultra wideband and low frequency metamaterial structures and to this end; GP is used to investigate the development of unconventional designs.

Objective: To observe the effects of Shenyi Capsule combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP) regimen in treatment of advanced esophageal cancer. Design, setting, participants and interventions: Sixty inpatients with advanced esophageal cancer from Henan Tumor Hospital, and the Fist Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were included and randomly divided into treatment group and control group. There were 30 cases in each group. Patients in the treatment group were treated with Shenyi Capsule <b>combined</b> with <b>GP</b> regimen, and patients {{in the control group}} were treated with GP regimen alone. Main outcome measures: The total response rate was calculated. The level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the chemotherapy side reaction and quality of life in the two groups were evaluated. The follow-up of survival time was conducted too. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} total response rate between the two groups (P= 0. 264). The levels of VEGF in the two groups were decreased as compared with that before the treatment. After treatment, the VEGF level in the treatment group was lower than that in the control group (P= 0. 002). The decline rates of white blood cell and blood platelet, and the incidence rate of nausea and vomiting in the treatment group were lower than those in the control group, and there were significant differences between the two groups (P= 0. 045, P= 0. 036, P= 0. 037).

The liver cirrhosis group and the HCC group had significantly higher serum levels of GP 73 and HA than the CHB group (U= 677, 637, 291, and 193, all P＜ 0. 05). In the liver cirrhosis group, the patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis had significantly higher serum levels of GP 73 and HA than those with compensated liver cirrhosis (U= 171 and 212, both P＜ 0. 05). As for CHB patients, <b>combined</b> measurement of <b>GP</b> 73 and HA had significantly higher AUC and sensitivity than GP 73 measured alone (AUC: 0. 950 vs 0. 790, Z= 2. 32, P＜ 0. 05; sensitivity: 91. 70 % vs 72. 20 %, χ 2 = 5. 14, P＜ 0. 05). In the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, GP 73 had a significantly higher sensitivity than HA (87. 90 % vs 69. 70 %, χ 2 = 6. 05, P＜ 0. 05), and compared with HA measured alone, <b>combined</b> measurement of <b>GP</b> 73 and HA had a significant reduction in specificity (62. 30 % vs 86. 80 %, χ 2 = 14. 60, P＜ 0. 05) and a significant increase in sensitivity (93. 90 % vs 69. 70 %, χ 2 = 11. 80, P＜ 0. 05). In the diagnosis of decompensated liver cirrhosis, <b>combined</b> measurement of <b>GP</b> 73 and HA a significantly higher sensitivity than HA measured alone (83. 80 % vs 67. 60 %, χ 2 = 4. 17, P＜ 0. 05). GP 73, HA, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) had an AUC of 0. 549, 0. 525, and 0. 807, respectively, in the diagnosis of HCC, and GP 73 and HA had a lower diagnostic value than AFP (Z= 3. 49 and 3. 80, both P＜ 0. 05). Conclusion GP 73 and HA can help with the monitoring of the progression of HBV-related chronic liver diseases. <b>Combined</b> measurement of <b>GP</b> 73 and HA has an important clinical value in the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and decompensated liver cirrhosis...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{assessment}} {{is a critical}} issue in organizations and academic researches. Libraries especially public libraries {{as the most important}} information sharing centers in society need a good model for performance appraisal. This appraisal is beneficiary for differentiating efficient centers from inefficient centers and suggesting good strategies for improving inefficient centers. In this research, data envelopment analysis (DEA) and goal programming (<b>GP)</b> <b>combined</b> for performance appraisal of public libraries in provinces and identifying efficient and inefficient centers. The results of implementing the model compound showed that of total 30 provinces in 2008, the public library of three provinces, i. e., South Khorasan, North Khorasan, and Mazandaran provinces, that are equivalent to 10 percent of the country, have been efficiency 100 percent...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} the implementation of an adaptable parallel architecture capable of system to task adaptation. The system implementation was based on XILINX FPGA devices. The adaptation was achieved by reconfiguring FPGAs to correspond to the task data flow graph. Scaling system resources and interconnecting them with a use of a virtual bus created clusters called group processors (GP). Each Group Processor operated as a fixed architecture system for the duration of the task. By developing custom macro operations such as vector processing units a speedup of as much as thirty times was obtained through hardware support and careful architecture selection. By developing multiple instances of macro-operations and <b>combining</b> them in <b>GPs</b> allowed efficient parallel processing. 1...|$|R
40|$|Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a {{class of}} agents that have potent {{antitumor}} activity with a reported ability to upregulate MHC and costimulatory molecule expression. We hypothesized that epigenetic pharmacological immunomodulation could sensitize tumors to immune mediated cell death with an adoptive T cell therapy. The pan-HDAC inhibitor, LBH 589, was <b>combined</b> with <b>gp</b> 100 specific T cell immunotherapy in an in vivo B 16 melanoma model and in an in vivo non-tumor bearing model. Tumor regression, tumor specific T cell function and phenotype, and serum cytokine levels were evaluated. Addition of LBH 589 to an adoptive cell transfer therapy significantly decreased tumor burden while sustaining systemic pro-inflammatory levels. Furthermore, LBH 589 was able to enhance gp 100 specific T cell survival and significantly decrease T regulatory cell populations systemically and intratumorally. Even {{in the absence of}} tumor, LBH 589 was able to enhance the proliferation, retention, and polyfunctional status of tumor specific T cells, suggesting its effects were T cell specific. In addition, LBH 589 induced significantly higher levels of the IL- 2 receptor (CD 25) and the co-stimulatory molecule OX- 40 in T cells. These results demonstrate that immunomodulation of adoptively transferred T cells by LBH 589 provides a novel mechanism to increase in vivo antitumor efficacy of effector CD 8 T cells...|$|R
50|$|Henry et al. {{hypothesized}} that, {{since the}} GPs seem more like galaxies at redshift=z>2, and Lyα is common at these redshifts, that Lyα would be {{common in the}} GPs as well. Observations with the HST using the COS, as in 'Description', proved this to be true for a sample of 10 GPs. The spectra, shown here to the right, indicate resonant scattering of Lyα photons that are emitted near zero velocity. The wealth of data existing on the <b>GPs,</b> <b>combined</b> with the COS spectra, allowed Henry et al. to explore the physical mechanisms that regulate the Lyα output. These authors concluded that variations {{in the amount of}} neutral hydrogen gas, which scatters Lyα photons, are the cause of a factor of 10 difference in Lyα output in their sample.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Automated rock {{recognition}} {{is a key}} step for building a fully autonomous mine. When characterizing rock types from drill performance data, the main challenge {{is that there is}} not an obvious one-to-one correspondence between the two. In this paper, a hybrid rock recognition approach is proposed which <b>combines</b> Gaussian Process (<b>GP)</b> regression with clustering. Drill performance data is also known as Measurement While Drilling (MWD) data and a rock hardness measure- Adjusted Penetration Rate (APR) is extracted using the raw data in discrete drill holes. GP regression is then applied to create a more dense APR distribution, followed by clustering which produces discrete class labels. No initial labelling is needed. Comparisons are made with alternative measures of rock hardness from MWD data as well as state-of-the-art GP classification. Experimental results from an actual mine site show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. I...|$|R
40|$|We use the {{lipophilic}} fluorescence probe Laurdan {{to study}} cell membranes. The generalized polarization (GP) of Laurdan-labeled cells contains useful information about membrane fluidity and polarity. A high GP is {{usually associated with}} low fluidity, low polarity, or high cholesterol content of the membranes, and a low GP is the opposite. We have <b>combined</b> the <b>GP</b> method and two-photon fluorescence microscopy to provide an alternative approach to study cell membranes. Using two-photon excitation in a conventional microscope offers great advantages for studying biological samples. These advantages include efficient background rejection, low photodamage, and improved depth discrimination. We performed GP measurements on mouse fibroblast cells and observed that both intensity and GP images are not spatially uniform. We tested for possible GP artifacts arising from cellular autofluorescence and lifetime quenching, using a procedure for background fluorescence subtraction and by direct lifetime measurements in the microscope. GP measured in a single cell displays a broad distribution, and the GP of 40 different cells grown on the same cover glass is also statistically distributed. The correlations between intensity and GP images were analyzed, and no monotonic dependence between the two was found. By digitally separating high and low GP values, we found that high GP values often associate with the regions of the plasma membrane and low GP values link with the nuclear membranes. Our results also show local GP variations within the plasma and nuclear membranes...|$|R
