They began to chase her at 10am, upon which she lowered the French colours she had been flying and hoisted Spanish ones. Mayne addressed his men saying 'When you received the pay of your <b>country,</b> <b>you</b> engaged yourselves to stand all dangers in her cause. Now is the trial; fight like men for you have no hope but in your courage.' After a two and half hour chase the British were able to come alongside and exchange broadsides, which eventually left the Spanish ship disabled. The British then raked her until she struck her colours. The Spanish ship had casualties of 33 killed and around 100 wounded, while eight men were killed aboard both Kent and Orford, and another one aboard Lenox. Total British wounded amounted to 40, and included Captain Durell of Kent, who had one of his hands shot away. The commander of Orford during the engagement had been Lord Augustus FitzRoy.|$|E

[...] Russian-speaking Israeli analyst Igor Khlopitsky stated that this also resulted from the Russian-speaking Israelis generally wanting quick results during times of turmoil, saying, [...] "Those who came after Perestroika had the Soviet mentality beaten out of them by the very difficult problems of the time.

500|$|Milner wanted full {{voting rights}} after five years' residence, a revised {{naturalisation}} oath and increased legislative representation {{for the new}} burghers.

The High Commissioner declared his original request an [...] "irreducible minimum" [...] and said he would discuss nothing else until the franchise question was resolved. On 5 June Milner proposed an advisory council of non-burghers to represent the uitlanders, prompting Kruger to cry: [...] "How can strangers rule my state? How is it possible!" [...] When Milner said he did not foresee this council taking on any governing role, Kruger burst into tears, saying [...] "It is our <b>country</b> <b>you</b> want".

500|$|Many {{of these}} attacks are {{considered}} to have been scurrilous, including suggestions that {{he was planning to}} [...] "crown himself king" [...] and [...] "grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne". However, Peter Shaw has argued that: [...] "he inevitable attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) at the time he wrote 'Davila', though he did not directly reveal this in its essays. Decidedly, sometime after he became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life." [...] In contradiction to such notions, Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson: [...] "If you suppose that I have ever had a design or desire of attempting to introduce a government of King, Lords and Commons, or in other words an hereditary Executive, or an hereditary Senate, either into the government of the United States, or that of any individual state, in this <b>country,</b> <b>you</b> are wholly mistaken. There is not such a thought expressed or intimated in any public writing or private letter of mine, and I may safely challenge all of mankind to produce such a passage and quote the chapter and verse." ...|$|E
500|$|The TV {{documentary}} [...] explored {{gay rights}} and homophobia in numerous {{countries in the}} world, including Russia. [...] In it, Fry interviews a lesbian couple who discuss their fears that simply being out to their 16-year-old daughter and her friends could be taken as breaking this law, due to the law's prohibition [...] "on anyone disseminating information about homosexuality to under 18s". [...] The LGBT news magazine The Advocate described the law as criminalising [...] "any positive discussion of LGBT people, identities, or issues in forums that might be accessible to minors. In practice, the law has given police broad license to interpret almost any mention of being LGBT [...] whether uttered, printed, or signified by waving a rainbow flag [...] as just cause to arrest LGBT people." [...] The US State Department in its 2013 report on human rights in Russia noted the clarification from Roskomnadzor (the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications) that the [...] "gay propaganda" [...] prohibited under the law includes materials which [...] "directly or indirectly approve {{of people who are}} in nontraditional sexual relationships." [...] One couple interviewed by Fry said: [...] "Of course we are afraid because we really don't know what's going to happen next in the <b>country.</b> ... <b>You</b> just don't know if they can incarcerate you tomorrow for something or not." [...] Fry also interviewed politician Vitaly Milonov, the original proponent of the law, whose attempts to defend it have been strongly criticised; Milonov responded branding Fry as [...] "sick" [...] for making a suicide attempt while filming the documentary in an interview in which he also compared homosexuality with bestiality.|$|E
