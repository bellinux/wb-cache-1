40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 seeks to maximize the collection {{of billions of dollars}} of nontax delinquent debt owed to the federal government. The act requires agencies to refer eligible debts delinquent more than 180 days to the Department of the Treasury for payment offset and to Treasury or a Treasury-designated debt collection center for cross-servicing. The Treasury Offset Program includes the offset of benefit payments, vendor payments, and tax refunds. Cross-servicing involves locating debtors, issuing demand letters, and referring debts to private <b>collection</b> <b>agencies.</b> The Farm <b>Service</b> <b>Agency</b> (FSA) has initiatives to ensure the timely referral of all delinquent debt. However, the agency's failure to make the act a priority has left key provisions of the legislation unimplemented and has severely reduced opportunities for collection. FSA lacks effective procedures and controls to identify and promptly refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury for collection action. GAO identified several obstacles to FSA's establishment and implementation of an effective and complete debt-referral process. In the four states with the highest dollar amounts of federal debt excluded from the Treasury Offset Program, GAO reviewed FSA's use of exclusions from referral requirements because of bankruptcy, forbearance/appeals, foreclosure and Department of Justice litigation. GAO found that about half of the exclusions in these states were inconsistent with established criteria. ...|$|R
