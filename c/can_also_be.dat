5|$|A few {{deductions}} <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{made from}} the satellite communications. The first deduction that can be {{made from the}} satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information to keep its antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E

5|$|In eukaryotes, {{modifications}} of RNA nucleotides are in general directed by small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA; 60–300nt), {{found in the}} nucleolus and cajal bodies. snoRNAs associate with enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA. These enzymes then perform the nucleotide modification. rRNAs and tRNAs are extensively modified, but snRNAs and mRNAs <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> the target of base modification. RNA <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> methylated.|$|E

5|$|Martingales <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> {{created from}} {{stochastic}} processes by applying some suitable transformations, {{which is the}} case for the homogeneous Poisson process (on the real line) resulting in a martingale called the compensated Poisson process. Martingales <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> built from other martingales. For example, there are martingales based on the martingale the Wiener process, forming continuous-time martingales.|$|E
