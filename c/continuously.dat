5|$|With The Mansion Of Happiness {{published}} from 1800 in England to 1926 in The United States, it is {{the longest}} <b>continuously</b> published board game with a known designer, George Fox. That totals 126 years of continuous publication. Obviously Chess, Draughts (Checkers), Go, and many other board games have been <b>continuously</b> published for a longer time, {{but no one knows}} the designer of these games.|$|E
5|$|Air {{that passes}} through the phonic lips passes into the distal sac, then back down through the left nasal passage. This {{recycling}} of air allows the whale to <b>continuously</b> generate clicks {{for as long as}} it is submerged.|$|E
5|$|AirTrain {{connects the}} airport {{terminals}} and parking areas with LIRR and subway lines in Queens. The system {{consists of three}} routes: one route each connecting the terminals with the Howard Beach and Jamaica stations, and one route looping <b>continuously</b> around the central terminal area.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is <b>continuously</b> formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated <b>continuously</b> or intermittently.|$|E
5|$|Around 1919 the {{basement}} was first leased to a pool hall, “Dad’s Billiard Room”. While this business {{was not present}} in 1920, {{the basement}} would house a pool hall <b>continuously</b> from 1927 into the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Avici/Avicimat (waterless/waveless): A person, who lies on oath or in business, is {{repeatedly}} thrown head-first from a 100 yojana {{high mountain}} whose sides are stone waves, but without water. His body is <b>continuously</b> broken, {{but it is}} made sure {{that he does not}} die.|$|E
5|$|Batik is {{traditionally}} sold in 2.25-metre lengths used for kain panjang or sarong. It is worn by wrapping {{it around the}} hip, or made into a hat known as blangkon. The cloth can be filled <b>continuously</b> with a single pattern or divided into several sections.|$|E

5|$|DCIEM has <b>continuously</b> {{evaluated}} and modified the model over the years. A revised set of tables {{was released in}} 1984, based on thousands of Doppler evaluated dives.|$|E
5|$|For 0<i<n, any mapping from S'i to S'n is {{homotopic}} (i.e., <b>continuously</b> deformable) to {{a constant}} mapping, i.e., a mapping that maps all of S'i {{to a single}} point of S'n. Therefore the homotopy group is the trivial group.|$|E
5|$|Gigha {{has been}} {{inhabited}} <b>continuously</b> since prehistoric times, {{and there are}} several standing stones on the island. There are many other archaeological sites, including cairns, standing stones, duns and an ogham stone near to Kilchattan, which has not been deciphered.|$|E

5|$|Some Myxogastria {{species may}} produce asexually. These are <b>continuously</b> diploid. There is no meiosis before the {{germination}} of the spores {{and the production}} of the plasmodium proceeds without germination of two cells.|$|E
5|$|Some clock-shift {{problems}} {{could be avoided}} by adjusting clocks <b>continuously</b> or at least more gradually—for example, Willett at first suggested weekly 20-minute transitions—but this would add complexity {{and has never been}} implemented.|$|E
5|$|The Capetians ruled <b>continuously</b> from 987 to 1792 {{and again}} from 1814 to 1848. The {{branches}} of the dynasty which ruled after 1328, however, are generally given the specific branch names of Valois (until 1589) and Bourbon (until 1848).|$|E
5|$|The Manor is now {{within the}} civil parish of Chippenham Without; {{unbroken}} occupation since 1282 makes Sheldon Manor Wiltshire's longest <b>continuously</b> inhabited manor house. It was granted Grade I listed building status by the Historic Building and Monuments Commission for England in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The Roosevelt dime is {{the current}} dime, or ten-cent piece, of the United States. Struck by the United States Mint <b>continuously</b> since 1946, it {{displays}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the obverse and was authorized soon {{after his death in}} 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{accumulated}} {{volume is}} calculated {{as a function}} of time by integrating over the product of the bubble number and the degree of supersaturation, and subtracting the free gas that is being dissipated <b>continuously</b> by the lung.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the total derivative f′(a) is strictly stronger than the {{existence of}} all the partial derivatives, but if the partial derivatives exist and are continuous, then the total derivative exists, is given by the Jacobian, and depends <b>continuously</b> on a.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} {{places in the}} ATP Rankings <b>continuously</b> since 25 July 2005 (exclusively by Federer and Nadal from July 2005 to August 2009), as of 16 October 2017.|$|E
5|$|The new Jerash Bridge {{crosses the}} Zarqa {{upstream}} of King Talal reservoir, {{on the road}} from Amman to Jerash. The bridge {{is the site of}} a gauging station where flow measurements are <b>continuously</b> taken.|$|E
5|$|The pulley (bearing the {{eccentric}} lug) {{is provided with}} a groove for the reception of the driving belt, an endless band which responds to {{the movement of the}} machine by <b>continuously</b> rotating the pulley.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruling was}} seen as a {{significant}} victory for the video game industry. Several of the Court's justices suggested that the issue might need to be re-examined in the future, considering the changing nature of video games and their <b>continuously</b> improving technology.|$|E

5|$|While it {{was long}} {{believed}} that the expansion rate has been <b>continuously</b> decreasing since the Big Bang, recent observations of the redshift-distance relationship using Type Ia supernovae have suggested that in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of the Universe has begun to accelerate.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} war, Robert McNamara stated that by spring 1967 {{he and other}} civilians in the {{administration}} had become convinced that both Rolling Thunder and the ground war in South Vietnam were not working. McNamara claimed that he and others within the administration <b>continuously</b> opposed the Joint Chief's recommendations for an increased tempo of bombing and the loosening of target restrictions. The generals found themselves on the horns of a dilemma of their own making. They <b>continuously</b> claimed that the campaign was working, yet they also had to <b>continuously</b> demand greater latitude {{in order to make}} the campaign succeed. The limited goals entailed in American foreign policy and the military's goal of total victory were simply not reconcilable. The great conundrum had then become how to defeat North Vietnam without defeating North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying {{his family}} on the variety show circuit, Sellers learned stagecraft, but {{received}} conflicting encouragement from his parents and developed mixed feelings about show business. His father doubted Sellers's abilities in the entertainment field, even suggesting that his son's talents were only enough to become a road sweeper, while Sellers's mother encouraged him <b>continuously.</b>|$|E
5|$|Burnett's subversive {{activities}} did not {{go unnoticed}} by his colleagues in Congress. He was absent when the body reconvened December 2, 1861. The following day, Indiana representative W.

Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America was chartered in 1847, Delta Sigma Pi in 1907, and Alpha Epsilon Pi in 1913. Delta Phi Epsilon {{was founded in}} 1917. The NYU Gamma chapter of Delta Phi, founded in 1841, is the longest <b>continuously</b> active fraternity chapter in the world, having never gone inactive since its establishment. Delta Phi is also the oldest <b>continuously</b> active fraternity in the United States, being the only organization in the original Union Triad to remain active since its institute. The NYU Gamma chapter of Zeta Beta Tau is the oldest active ΖΒΤ chapter in the country.|$|E
5|$|Hussain's first {{passion was}} journalism; his {{earliest}} successful magazine was Filmasia, {{dedicated to the}} Indian and Pakistani film industries. Akhbar-e-Watan, a monthly Urdu cricket magazine, was edited by him from 1977 to 2010. Hussain <b>continuously</b> wrote weekly cricket columns for the Daily Jang, the Pakistan's largest and oldest circulation newspaper, for almost four decades.|$|E
