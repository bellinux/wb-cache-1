5000|$|The ESA Cluster {{mission has}} enabled {{to find the}} first direct {{evidence}} of cross-scale energy transport between fluid and ion-scale waves, explaining why Earth's magnetic environment is so hot. A Nature Physics paper reveals. The Earth's internal magnetic field creates a giant protective bubble called the magnetosphere, necessary for life to develop. This magnetic bubble helps deflecting more than 99% of the incoming solar wind expelled by the Sun. Due to this interaction, the magnetosphere has a bullet-like shape (see left panel of Figure 1). At its border, the magnetopause, the matter, <b>called</b> <b>plasma,</b> <b>is</b> 50 times hotter inside the Earth's magnetic environment than just outside; a problem that has puzzled scientists {{since the beginning of}} the space age. Why is Earth's environment so hot? How plasma gets heated in a medium where no particles collides? One of the few physical processes enabling solar wind plasma to enter the magnetosphere is called the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This instability is ubiquitous in space and on Earth. Such K-H waves have been detected in various media including the surface of oceans, in clouds (see bottom right panel of Image 1), in the solar corona (see top right panel) or in the atmosphere of giant planets. Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) waves can form at Earth's magnetopause, mainly due to the velocity difference between the plasma flowing outside at higher speed than inside the magnetosphere. Back in 2004, the multi-spacecraft Cluster mission revealed that these waves can roll-up, turning into giant vortices of about 36,000 km size, i.e. about 6 times the Earth's radius (Hasegawa et al., 2004). A new article, published in Nature Physics this month, presents a detailed study of small-scale (ion-scale) wave packets captured by Cluster within such a macroscopic (fluid-scale) Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex. This study reveals for the first time that these wave packets in the eye of the vortex are magnetosonic waves with sufficient energy to account for the observed level of ion heating. In other words, these waves can heat the cooler ions of magnetosheath origin; magnetosheath is the boundary layer located just outside the magnetopause. These observations may be evidence for cross-scale energy transport in space plasmas. It may have universal consequences in understanding the energy transport from fluid to ion scales, and can play a role in a variety of plasma systems with a velocity shear.|$|E

These waves, or surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), have amplitude exponentially decaying along the transverse axis. Since the waves have shorter wavelength than the incident light, light can be tightly confined in a subwavelength size area and the local field intensity can be enhanced significantly. In the process, the evanescent waves are enhanced, leading to sub-diffraction limit imaging.|$|R

This makes their study complex and fascinating. Plasma physics and its lighthouse application, controlled thermonuclear fusion, thus offers new challenges to mathematicians.

During the first voltage pulses after the initial ignition a transition from branching to guided streamers is indeed observed. The length of the guided part of the streamer is determined from individual recordings of the emission with an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera to examine the transition. This process is repeated for different applied pulse voltages, repetition frequencies and gas flow rates to establish the relation between the development and these parameters. With a numerical calculation of the gas velocity field we show that the development of the guiding channel is closely related to the transport of remnants of previous discharges in the gas flow. 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014. Incoherent-scatter radar {{data from}} Poker Flat, Alaska {{has been used}} to {{determine}} size distributions of electron density structures in the evening time sector of the auroral zone. At high latitudes ionospheric plasma typically moves east-west with speeds of several hundred meters per second. Density irregularities that rapidly move through the radar beam are therefore observed as time-varying power fluctuations. The new phased array radar used for this study has been operated with several antenna directions with successive pulses transmitted in each direction. It is therefore possible to observe plasma Doppler velocities in multiple directions and determine the vector direction of the plasma motion. This near-simultaneous observation of the plasma velocity in conjunction with the electron density height profile data enable a new technique to determine the scale sizes of electron density fluctuations that move horizontally through the radar beam. The study focuses on the collision-less F-region ionosphere where the <b>plasma</b> drift <b>is</b> approximately constant with altitude. The experimental technique limits the range of scale sizes that may be studied to relatively large-scale sizes (i. e. greater than few tens of km). Results show that during magnetically disturbed conditions (Kp ≥ 4) when westward <b>plasma</b> velocities <b>are</b> relatively high (500 - 1000 m/s) the scale sizes of irregularities (often <b>called</b> <b>plasma</b> blobs) <b>are</b> in the range of 100 - 300 km and predominantly originate from the polar cap and are transported over long distances (~ 1000 km) due to the long chemical recombination times (30 - 90 minutes). Some irregularities are caused by local auroral particle precipitation and have been identified with associated electron temperature enhancements. For cases of low magnetic activity (Kp ≤ 1), when the radar is located in a region of low plasma velocities (100 - 500 m/s) well south of the auroral oval (essentially a mid-latitude type ionosphere), the density distribution is always biased strongly toward small-scale sizes (less than 50 km) ...|$|R
