2500|$|A method {{commonly}} used to protect a structural metal is to attach a metal which is more anodic than the metal to be protected.

30|$|On {{examination}} of the polarization data, it is understand that the citrate ion mainly acts on <b>cathodic</b> sites of <b>corrosion.</b> The <b>cathodic</b> slopes of polarization curves of steel rebar in TSC solution were considerably changed than that of blank experiment. Similar trend was observed for the polarization curves of steel rebar in TSC–ZnAc solution (Fig.  1 c). The steel rebar treated with concrete pore solution containing 100  ppm of citrate and 50  ppm of zinc acetate displayed least value for cathodic slope in Tafel plot, suggesting that this particular combination has a great influence on the <b>cathodic</b> process of <b>corrosion</b> than any other combination. In alkaline medium, the main half cell reactions responsible for the corrosion are the oxidation of Fe into Fe 2 + (anodic) and reduction of O 2 into OH− (cathodic). Citrates and citric acid are well known for its anti-oxidant property [52, 53]. The anti-oxidant property of citrate ion arises due to the scavenging of oxygen molecules. Since citrate ions mainly affect the <b>cathodic</b> sites of <b>corrosion,</b> it can be robustly believed that the oxygen molecules available for the reduction process are considerably reduced {{in the presence of}} citrate ions. Thus, it can be concluded that the ability of TSC and TSC–ZnAc systems to decrease the rate of corrosion of steel rebar in concrete pore solution is due to the combined action of adsorption and scavenging of oxygen molecules.|$|R

40|$|A {{range of}} Ni–W thin film alloys have been {{synthesised}} by evaporation from atomic sources {{to produce a}} compositional gradient across the substrate, and characterised by X-ray diffraction (phase identification and crystallite size) and EDX (composition). The corrosion resistance of 100 discrete alloy compositions has been measured simultaneously in identical environments using a high-throughput screening protocol based on cyclic voltammetry. The corrosion resistances and potentials are extracted from potentiodynamic data by both the linear polarisation resistance (LPR) and Tafel extrapolation methods; results from these are shown to be self-consistent. The high-throughput approach allows, for the first time, a direct correlation to be made between the bulk crystalline phases and morphology, and the corrosion behaviour of Ni–W alloys. The incorporation of W in the Ni–W solid solution at low W compositions results in a continuous reduction in crystallite size, a small <b>cathodic</b> shift in <b>corrosion</b> potential, and a small reduction in corrosion resistance.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss a novel {{mechanistic}} model describing the coupling between the PEFC MEA electro-catalysis and the cathode carbon catalyst-support corrosion. On a physical basis, the model describes the feedback between the instantaneous performance and the intrinsic cathode carbon oxidation process. It allows exploring the impact of the operating conditions and the initial electrodes compositions on the PEFC MEA durability. Some numerical simulations show agreement with experimental knowledge already reported in literature: in particular, when the anode chamber is partially exposed to oxygen (induced by PEM crossover or fuel starvation), cathode thickness decrease and cell potential decay are predicted. Furthermore, we found that cathode damage increases as platinum loading increases and as platinum nano-particles size decreases. On the basis of our modeling approach we propose, and experimentally validate, the use of anodic CO injection as a way to mitigate <b>cathodic</b> carbon <b>corrosion</b> in in-house elaborated model MEAs...|$|R

The cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) measurements indicated that increasing the time of immersion decreases the anodic, <b>cathodic</b> and <b>corrosion</b> currents. Chronoamperometric current-time (CCT) experiments at- 0. 5 and- 0. 35 V vs. Ag/AgCl showed that the absolute current of the steel decreases with increasing immersion time and that pitting corrosion occurs only at- 0. 35 V as indicated also by scanning electron microscope images. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed the results obtained by CPP and CCT that the increase of immersion time from 1 h to 24 h increases both the solution and polarization resistances.

Corrosion rates were measured via a galvanic cell, where we measure {{the current and}} potential between two wafers coated with dissimilar metals, submerged in process solvents, strippers, and etch solutions (see Figure 1). Galvanic corrosion was more closely correlated to the current of the galvanic {{as opposed to the}} potential in static sovent tests. In addition to the static-solvent tests, large current spikes were observed when transitioning from one solvent to another as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Based on these results, the fundamental design of the metallization scheme as well as multi-solvent process flows can be optimized to minimize galvanic corrosion and subsequent electrical and visual defects.

In this paper, the corrosion behavior of St 52 - 3 rotating disc electrode, RDE, in NaCl solution containing ZnSO 4 salt, as a <b>cathodic</b> inorganic <b>corrosion</b> inhibitor, has been studied under different hydrodynamic conditions. Two electrochemical methods, including potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, have been used. The effects of solution hydrodynamic on the open circuit potential, polarization curves and electrochemical impedance diagrams of the steel RDE in blank NaCl solution {{as well as in}} the solution containing ZnSO 4 have been considered. It has been shown that ZnSO 4 inhibits the corrosion of steel in NaCl solution. By increasing the rotational speed, in the absence and presence of inhibitor, the corrosion current density increased and charge transfer resistance decreased. ZnSO 4 had relatively low efficiency in stagnant conditions but its influence improved significantly under hydrodynamic conditions. It was mainly attributed to an increase in Zn 2 + ions mass transport towards electrode surface, which leads to the formation of more protective films and therefore, enhances the protection against corrosion...|$|R
