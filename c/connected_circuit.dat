50|$|Coupling to the {{resonator}} can {{be achieved}} with a tap wire soldered to the helix at {{some distance from the}} shorted end. Input impedance varies with distance from the shorted end by impedance transformer action. The tap point is chosen to achieve an impedance match with the <b>connected</b> <b>circuit.</b> Tuning of the resonator may be achieved by inserting a screw into the central axis of the helix (Weston, 2001, p. 660). Other means of input and output coupling used are a wire loop coupling to the magnetic field near the shorted end, or a probe capacitively coupling near the open end. Coupling between resonators in a multi-resonator filter is often simply achieved with apertures in the shielding between them (Whittaker, 2000, p. 227).|$|E

There are many phenomenological theories about it, but not fundamental ones. The sintered arrester consists of huge numbers of fine semi-conductingparticles.

The nonlinear characteristics is expected to arise from such huge numbers of random connections. A simulation of random <b>connected</b> <b>circuit</b> with many transistors is carried out. Its circuit is connected by following severe rules controlled with random numbers. It is found from preliminary simulations that random connected circuits with transistors result in cut off states in any stage and the stages agree with {{the results from the}} analysis of probability theory.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} new simulation and analytic models for the performance analysis of wide area communication networks. The models are used to analyse adaptive routing and flow control in fully <b>connected</b> <b>circuit</b> switched and sparsely connected packet switched networks. In particular the performance of routing algorithms derived from the L(_R-I) linear learning automata model are assessed for both types of network. A novel architecture using the INMOS Transputer is constructed for simulation of both circuit and packet switched networks in a loosely coupled multi- microprocessor environment. The network topology is mapped onto an identically configured array of processing centres to overcome the processing bottleneck of conventional Von Neumann architecture machines. Previous analytic work in circuit switched work is extended to include both asymmetrical networks and adaptive routing policies. In the analysis of packet switched networks analytic models of adaptive routing and flow control are integrated to produce a powerful, integrated environment for performance analysis The work concludes that routing algorithms based on linear learning automata have significant potential in both fully <b>connected</b> <b>circuit</b> switched networks and sparsely connected packet switched networks...|$|E

40|$|Characteristics of {{variable}} threshold voltage CMOS (VTCMOS) {{in the series}} connected circuits are investigated by means of device simulation. It is newly found that the performance degradation due to the body effect in series <b>connected</b> <b>circuit</b> is suppressed by utilizing VTCMOS. Lowering the threshold voltage (Vth) enhances the drive current and alleviates the degradation due to the series connected configuration. Therefore, larger body effect factor (γ) results in lower Vth and higher on-current even in the series connected circuits. These characteristics are attributed to the velocity saturation phenomenon which reduces the drain saturation voltage (Vdsat).

40|$|The equatorward {{shift of}} the midday part of the auroral oval (the cusp region) during the {{expansion}} phase of magnetospheric substorms is reexamined. A magnetospheric model developed by Akasofu and Corrick (1980) is used, which is constructed by using the earth's dipole field, an image dipole field {{of the earth and}} 40 bisected circular loops. A new dayside current system represented by six current loops separated by 15 deg in longitude, each carrying 100 KA, is added to this model. For a total current of. 6 MA, the latitude of the cusp shifts equatorward by 1. 8 deg; for a current of 1. 8 MA, the cusp location shifts by more than 5 deg. Thus, the magnetic field of an enhanced dynamo current is the dayside boundary layer and of the <b>connected</b> <b>circuit</b> can account for the observed equatorward {{shift of the}} cusp region...|$|E

40|$|In many fluidic digital circuits, {{the control}} signals are {{transmitted}} through a transmission line as either step or pulse signals. In this case, the unexpected transient phenomena from only the static characteristics of devices occur often {{due to the}} operating conditions. And this may cause false operation of the circuit. In this paper, using a graphical method for the transmission line, we investigate the dynamic characteristics (switching delay time etc.) of <b>connecting</b> <b>circuits</b> of two wall attachment devices. In the graphical method, we assume the lossless line for simplicity. Some experiments were carried with laboratory devices and the commercially available devices (CORNING devices). The effects of the supply pressure of devices and the dimensions of transmission line (length and inner diameter) on the switching characteristics of driven device were investigated. And these results were compared with the predicted results by the graphical method. The experimental results can be explained well by the graphical solution. Thus, when the static characteristics of devices are given, this graphical method can easily predict the dynamic characteristics of <b>connecting</b> <b>circuit</b> of the devices for a given operating conditions or decide the optimal operating condition for a given devices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a learning {{theory of the}} CNN based on the covariance structure analysis using new numerical integral methods. In general, a Cellular Neural Network (CNN) {{is defined as a}} local <b>connected</b> <b>circuit</b> which has continuous state variables x ∈ Rn. The importance is in that the piece-wise linear function of the CNN has a linear region |x | ≤ 1 for x ∈ x because the learning method can be constructed only in linear state and measurement equations, and because the linear region can be quantized from the continuous variable x to the multi-level quantized variablef(x) by each 1 -bit Σδ modulator which is corresponding to a spiking neuron model. That is, our purpose is to determine the weight parameters θ in the connection matrices A,B,C,D,T and e by the machine learning method for equilibrium points of the CNN states equation x ̇ = 0. The covariance structure for the equilibrium point to the linear region will be constructed based on extended Chua’s CNN theorem to have symmetric edges for aij = aji and asymmetric one-way edge aij = 0 for aji = 0 for A-matrix A = [aij].

40|$|Abstract – The {{paper is}} divided into two parts. The first part of the paper gives the {{motivation}} to use SoC bus for system integration of a SoC as well as a brief review of the SoC concept, IP reuse, and research on SoC bus and SoC interconnect network. We define the SoC network as “classical SoC network ” that delivers data packets on a network. We point out in the paper that the classical SoC network introduces long data latency and contributes to high silicon cost. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we introduce the SoC bus research from Linköping University. We introduce a novel concept, PCC: Packet <b>Connected</b> <b>Circuit.</b> Based on PCC, a data transaction is initialized by packet routing. The rout is locked as a bus circuit after proving and acknowledging the rout. Therefore, we reach fixed and low transfer latency based on high bandwidth supporting multiple simultaneous data transfer. At the same time, buffers in the nodes are eliminated so that the silicon cost of a SoC network becomes feasible. MESA and MISA models are proposed for improving wrappers. A SoC system designer’s methodology is proposed so that a short TTM (Time To Market) SoC design is possible. 1...|$|E

40|$|With {{the current}} trend in {{integration}} of more complex systems on chip {{there is a need}} for better communication infrastructure on chip that will increase the available bandwidth and simplify the interface verification. We have previously proposed a circuit switched two-dimensional mesh network known as SoCBUS that increases performance and lowers the cost of verification. In this paper, the SoCBUS is explained together with the working principles of the transaction handling. We also introduce the concept of packet <b>connected</b> <b>circuit,</b> PCC, where a packet is switched through the network locking the circuit as it goes. PCC is deadlock free and does not impose any unnecessary restrictions on the system while being simple and efficient in implementation. SoCBUS uses this PCC scheme to set up routes through the network. We introduce a possible application, a telephone to voice-over-IP gateway, and use this to show that the SoCBUS have very good properties in bandwidth, latency, and complexity when used in a hard real time system with scheduling of the traffic. The simulations analysis of the SoCBUS in the application show that a certain SoCBUS setup can handle 48000 channels of voice data including buffer swapping in a single chip. We also show that the SoCBUS is not suitable for general purpose computing platforms that exhibit random traffic patterns but that the SoCBUS show acceptable performance when the traffic is mainly local. 1...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the various methods and circuits {{that have been}} developed to detect an islanding condition for photovoltaic applications and presents three methods {{that have been developed}} to test those methods and circuits. Passive methods for detecting an islanding condition basically monitor parameters such as voltage and frequency and/or their characteristics and cause the inverter to cease converting power when there is sufficient transition from normal specified conditions. Active methods for detecting the island introduce deliberate changes or disturbances to the <b>connected</b> <b>circuit</b> and then monitor the response to determine if the utility grid with its stable frequency, voltage and impedance is still connected. If the small perturbation is able to affect the parameters of the load connection within prescribed requirements, the active circuit causes the inverter to cease power conversion and delivery of power to the loads. The methods not resident in the inverter are generally controlled by the utility or have communications between the inverter and the utility to affect an inverter shut down when necessary. This report also describes several test methods that may be used for determining whether the anti-islanding method is effective. The test circuits and methodologies used in the U.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} an investigation of the arc end glow discharges occurring between the contacts when an alternating current is interrupted by an oil circuit breaker; and a comparison with similar phenomena in the vacuum circuit breaker is made. This investigation was made by taking cathode-ray oscillograms of the variation of voltage across the contacts, and the current through the discharge, with time, and the variation of the voltage across the contacts with the current through the discharge. Circuit voltages of 15, 000 and 2300 were used, and currents up to 45 amperes were interrupted. The discharges across the separating contacts of an oil circuit breaker are discussed in detail, and an analysis of the variations near the zero of the current wave is made. This investigation shows that for a brief period, of the order of 300 microseconds, {{at the end of each}} half cycle of the current wave the current between the contacts is of a very small magnitude, and may be considered essentially zero. During this interval the voltage completes a part of an oscillation, the frequency of which is apparently determined by the constants of the <b>connected</b> <b>circuit,</b> and rises in the reverse direction until a certain maximum is reached. After this value is reached current again flows end the usual glow and arc phenomena are observed. </p...|$|E
