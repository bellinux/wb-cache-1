50|$|The most {{challenging}} balancing problem arises in application to SLAPP claims {{which do not}} sound (give rise to a <b>claim)</b> <b>in</b> <b>tort.</b> The common law and constitutional law have developed in the United States to create a high substantive burden to tort and tort-like claims which seek redress for public speech, especially public speech which addresses matters of public concern. The common law in many states requires the pleader to state accurately the content of libelous words. Constitutional law has provided substantive protection which bars recovery against a first amendment defense except upon clear and convincing evidence {{that there has been}} deliberate or reckless falsehood. For this reason, ferreting out the bad faith SLAPP claim at an early stage of litigation should be accomplished with relative ease. Extension of the SLAPP penalties to factually complex cases, where the substantive standard of proof at common law is lower presents special challenges.|$|E

This is later adopted and refined in Central Trust Company v. Rafuse, 1986 2 S.C.R. 147.

Arden LJ emphasised that piercing the corporate veil was not necessary. There would be direct liability in tort for the parent company if it had interfered in the subsidiary's affairs.

40|$|The {{status of}} “wife” confers {{on a woman}} a legal {{standing}} in relation to her husband which accords on her certain legal rights. In the context of Malaysian civil law this includes the right to initiate a <b>claim</b> <b>in</b> <b>tort</b> for any injuries or loss suffered by her deceased husband arising from the negligence of another. Such a right is conferred under s. 7 of the Civil Law Act 1956. The Court of Appeal in a recent unanimous decision in Tan Siew Sen & Others v Nick Abu Dusuki Bin Hj Abu Hassan [Civil Appeal No. B- 04 - 249 - 09 / 2014] has ruled, that {{in the context of}} Non- Muslim marriages, only registration will confer the status of “wife” for the purpose all civil actions and thereby has narrowed the legal definition of the term “wife” in Malaysian civil law. The ruling of the court has the effect extending the application and scope of the Law Reform (Marriage & Divorce) Act 1976 beyond the parameters. Objectives: The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the social justice ramifications of narrowing the legal definition of “wife” for civil actions in Malaysia, with particular reference to the interpretation of s. 7 of the Civil Law Act 1956 which is a statutory provision applicable to both Muslims and Non –Muslims alike.

Conclusion: The narrow interpretation is contrary to legislative intent and will result is social injustice of its preamble and thereby judicially transforming the definition of the term “wife” in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate within the law of unjust {{enrichment}} whether {{the victim of a}} pickpocket has, in addition to a <b>claim</b> <b>in</b> <b>tort</b> against the thief, one in unjust enrichment. Those who argue that he does say that it follows a fortiori from the availability of claims in unjust enrichment for mistake. If the law gives a claim where the transferor's consent to the transfer was merely vitiated, as it does in cases of mistake, so too should it do so where he was ignorant, giving no consent whatever to the 'transfer'. This idea is used by the protagonists of ignorance as the basis of an explanation of a number of controversial cases, especially Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale and Foskett v McKeown, as belonging within unjust enrichment. This article questions whether the argument is correct. Differently to the case of a mistaken transfer, where the claimant's title passes to the defendant, the pickpocket victim's title stays put. That would seem to be fatal to any unjust enrichment analysis, for an essential element of such a claim, an enrichment at the claimant's expense, now appears to be missing. The question then is whether that objection can be overcome. Various strategies have been proposed, that the law looks to 'factual' rather than 'technical' enrichments, that title can be electively transferred by the victim to the thief and that title can simply be renounced. None of these strategies work, however, with the consequence that any claim by a victim against his thief can only be in tort, not unjust enrichment. © The Author 2008.

40|$|The {{last five}} years have {{witnessed}} {{a decrease in the}} parallelism between EU competition and consumer law policies. Recent policy and legislative developments in these politically distinct areas of EU law highlight that effective consumer protection and redress – where it does not currently exist at the level of Member States – will increasingly rely upon effective regulation and enforcement of anti-competitive business practices via EU competition law. Indeed recital 7 of Regulation EC 1 / 2003 requires Member States to ensure that private individuals can pursue private redress mechanisms via national courts. Consequently, the increasing prevalence of private enforcement – namely private claims for damages – as a means of regulating market activity and enhancing consumer protection between the Member States necessitates reference to Community rules on private international law. In 2002 Withers commented that the ‘cause of action [for a <b>claim</b> <b>in</b> <b>tort</b> for breach of competition law] is very much at an incipient stage of development'. The same could be said for analogous rules of EU private international law. Indeed, at the time Withers's valuable analysis of jurisdiction and applicable law rules alluded to the need for many other significant ‘additional procedural and evidential issues’ to be addressed to ensure the effectiveness of private enforcement as a remedy for victims of anti-competitive behaviour. Nevertheless, in accordance with Treaty obligations, the EU has continued to implement measures designed to facilitate private enforcement of competition laws. Furthermore it has also continued to implement measures pursuant to judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters. The most recent development connecting both measures is Regulation EC 864 / 2007 on the Law Applicable to Non-Contractual Obligations (hereafter the Rome II Regulation), which provides rules to determine the applicable law of a non-contractual obligation. A key development offered by this new, communitarised private international law instrument is contained in Article 6. Article 6 of the Rome II Regulation determines the applicable law that will apply when private, final consumers or their representatives claim damages against businesses for anti-competitive practices or acts which have restricted competition, thereby impeding consumer choice...|$|E

40|$|Most legal {{scholarship}} on tort focuses primarily on judicial decisions, but this represents {{only a limited}} aspect of tortious liability.

40|$|Sometimes {{a person}} may enter into a {{contract}} {{as a result of a}} statement made to him which is false. If the statement is a term of the contract he will have a remedy for breach of contract. If the statement is not a term of the contract it is called a mere misrepresentation, and the consequence is rescission of contract. A misrepresentation is an untrue statement of fact which is one of the causes which induces the contract. A misrepresentation is statement, or conduct, which conveys a false or wrong impression. A contract may be rescined on the ground of misrepresentation even if innocent. An innocent misrepresentation is one made with reasonable ground for believing it to be true, as where an honest mistake is made. The types of misrepresentation are various. Acording to the Obligation Act it is not any misrepresentation cause the rescind of contract, but only the importance one. The importance misrepresentations are: the error in supstantia and error in personae if the contract is made bearing in mind intuit personae contract. This paper explanes different kinds of misrepresentation giving some proposal for legal interpretation of the provisions of the Obligation Act. The misrepresentation means an untrue statement of facts, made by one party to the other in the course of negotiating a contract, that induces the other party to enter into the contract. The person making the misrepresentation is called the representor, and the person whom it is made is the representee. A false of fraudulent misrepresentation is one made with knowledge of its falsehood, and intended to deceive. In the case of fraudulent misrepresentation representor did not honestly believe in the truth of his statement, which is not the same as saying that he knew it to be false. A negligent misrepresentation is one made with no reasonable grounds for believing in to be true. An innocent misrepresentation is one made with reasonable grounds for believing in to the true, as where an honest mistake is made. A fraudulent misrepresentation is actionable as a tort. When a person has been induced to {{enter into a contract}} by misrepresentation, he may in general either (1) affirm the contract and insist of the misrepresentation being made good, if that is possible, or (2) rescind the contract if it is still executory, and if all parties can be restored to their original positions, or (3) bring an action for damages, or (4) rely upon the misrepresentation as a defense to an action on the contract. A contract may be rescinded of the ground of misrepresentation even if innocent. Specific performance will not be decreed if a definite untrue representation has been relied on. It is clear that the claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation is a <b>claim</b> <b>in</b> <b>tort.</b> So the general governing rule is that the plaintiff should be restored to the position he would have been in if the representation had not been made. In the article is also analyzed comparative law related on misrepresentaton...|$|E
40|$|The English law of unjust, or unjustified, {{enrichment}} {{is part of}} {{the civil}} law of obligations, which comprises also the law of contract and the law of torts. A claim based upon the recipientâ€™s enrichment requires that the defendant be benefited at the expenses of the claimant and that the transfer of wealth from the claimant to the defendant be tainted by an unjust factor. A claim in unjust enrichment aims to achieve restitution of the defendantâ€™s gain, whereas a <b>claim</b> <b>in</b> <b>tort</b> redresses the loss of the claimant. Unlike tort law, the wrongfulness of the defendantâ€™s behaviour is not a requisite of the cause of action in unjust enrichment. In this paper, enrichment claims will be examined {{from the perspective of a}} theory which considers the law of enrichment in historical and comparative perspective. In applying this theory, I will argue that, in many European legal systems, civil claims which target the defendant qua enriched, as opposed to wrongdoer or contractual party, show a tendency to follow two main patterns. They are prone to lean either towards a strict legal principle or towards a more lenient approach linked to a principle of justice. Accordingly, it has been submitted that the qualification of the enrichment reflects this partition: â€˜unjustifiedâ€™ enrichment claims display different characteristics and a different application radius in comparison with claims which are triggered by an â€˜unjustâ€™ enrichment. This view has been advanced and defended elsewhere. Its precepts will be only summarised here to set the framework for its application to a decision of the House of Lords, Sempra Metals v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, which raises the question of the position taken by English law within this European trend. After a brief exposition of the account which distinguishes the concepts of â€˜unjustâ€™ and â€˜unjustifiedâ€™ enrichment, I shall consider some questions which emerge from the analysis of the judicial opinions in Sempra. I shall argue that Sempra raises structural issues similar to those which characterise civil law developments in this area. Their Lordshipsâ€™ opinions reveal a certain degree of consistency between English law and the dual-pillar approach which, it is suggested, is a recurrent, albeit unstated, character in the law of enrichment of civilian systems. As the historical development of civil law models indicates, the polarisation of the legal actions is likely to be due to a tension between the clarity and relative strictness of the claim in unjustified enrichment on the one hand and the flexibility of the claim in unjust enrichment on the other hand. This tension between the two claims is to be welcomed since it sharpens the remedial tools at the courtâ€™s disposal to nullify the consequences of misplacements of wealth. This paper is not intended as an essay on Sempra even though this judicial decision is central to it. As such, no attempt will be made to engage with all the issues raised by the Law Lords nor will the main theoretical accounts of unjust enrichment linked to this case be reviewed. Rather, the Sempra case will be used as a means by which the theory distinguishing unjust and unjustified transfers of wealth, and in particular its practical significance, will be tested. Since the essay is not primarily targeted at Roman lawyers, the analysis of Roman law will be kept to a minimum...|$|E

The present compensation system under the law of tort leaves many victims of personal injury uncompensated in Nigeria.
