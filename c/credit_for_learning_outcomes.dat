40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationship}} between receiving <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> prior <b>learning</b> and persistence. Adult students, who now comprise about 50 % of the undergraduate population, often bring to college prior learning which is equivalent to learning taught in the classroom. Almost all colleges and universities offer at least one method to validate and receive <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> prior <b>learning.</b> ^ This study uses an ex post facto research design. The subjects are the 2, 825 new students who matriculated in the Fall of 1982 at a community college located near Philadelphia. The students are divided into three groups [...] students who: (1) receive <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> prior <b>learning</b> at entry to the college, (2) receive <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> prior <b>learning</b> after attending the college for at least one year, and (3) do not seek <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> prior <b>learning.</b> Enrollment patterns are tracked over a four year period. Through factor analysis, a single persistence factor is derived from six measures of persistence. ^ A regression analysis of this persistence factor on eight student characteristics yields three variables that are significant in predicting persistence [...] grade point average, age and receiving <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> prior <b>learning</b> after at least one year of college attendance. Students with higher grade point averages have a greater likelihood of persisting. Younger students are more likely to persist than are older students. Receiving credit at entry to college is not significant in predicting persistence. However, students who receive <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> prior <b>learning</b> after attending one year persist to a significantly greater degree than students who do not seek <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> prior <b>learning.</b> ^ Since most prior learning programs are primarily designed for or focus on new students, the results suggest that methods should be developed and well advertised to encourage and facilitate entry into prior learning programs by attending students. Future research should review the effect that receiving <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> prior <b>learning</b> has on individual students. Focusing on changes in personal characteristics such as motivation, confidence, and self-esteem could provide a better understanding of why students who receive <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> prior <b>learning</b> after attending one year have higher levels of persistence. ...|$|R

Physical {{activity and}} sedentary behavior appear {{to be related to}} <b>learning</b> <b>outcomes</b> in children and to cognition across the whole lifespan. Research in adults, concerning physical activity and sedentary behavior and their relationship with <b>learning</b> <b>outcomes,</b> is not apparent. Therefore, we investigated if and how they are related in adults participating in distance education. The study was executed among Open University (NL) students in a cross-sectional survey-research. Opposed to our hypothesis physical activity was a negative predictor <b>for</b> <b>learning</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Possibly, time spent on physical activity in this specific group of students could detract from the time they spent on learning, as it is likely that their spare time is limited. Also, opposed to our hypothesis, sedentary behavior was positively associated with <b>learning</b> <b>outcomes.</b> As spare time is likely to be scarce it could be that time spent learning adds to the time spent sitting, as it is highly likely that most students will study sitting. Thus, possibly resulting in sedentary behavior being a positive predictor <b>for</b> <b>learning</b> <b>outcomes.</b> As expected, physical activity and sedentary behavior appeared to be each independent and separate constructs as they both added uniquely to the regression model.
