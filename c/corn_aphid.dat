Regression and partial correlation analysis showed no relationship between <b>corn</b> leaf <b>aphid</b> colonization and DIMBOA. These data indicate that DIMBOA is not a primary resistance factor in maize to corn leaf aphids;Corn leaf aphid feeding on coleoptile and two-leaf stage maize plants reduced plant height and delayed pollen shedding and silking. Grain fill was reduced when aphids fed on coleoptile, two-leaf, and four-leaf stage maize. Grain fill reductions occurred on inbreds B 37, C 103, and 41 : 2504 B, but not on B 73 and Mo 17. <b>Corn</b> leaf <b>aphid</b> damage on seedling maize resulted in yield reductions;Examination of late-whorl stage and seedling maize indicated that 57 % of the <b>corn</b> leaf <b>aphid</b> stylet tracks penetrated late-whorl stage plants through stomata.

All of these viruses are obligately aphid transmitted and phloem-limited. The first described YDVs (initially all called BYDV) were classified by their most efficient vector.

Nor is BYDV-RMV closely related to any other particular polerovirus. Depending on the gene that is compared, different poleroviruses (none of them a YDV) share the most sequence similarity to BYDV-RMV.

40|$|Concerns about {{possible}} undesired {{environmental effects of}} transgenic crops have prompted numerous evaluations of such crops. So-called Bt crops receive particular attention because they carry bacteria-derived genes coding for insecticidal proteins that might negatively affect non-target arthropods. Here we show a remarkable positive effect of Bt maize {{on the performance of}} the <b>corn</b> leaf <b>aphid</b> Rhopalosiphum maidis, which in turn enhanced the performance of parasitic wasps that feed on aphid honeydew. Within five out of six pairs that were evaluated, transgenic maize lines were significantly more susceptible to aphids than their near-isogenic equivalents, with the remaining pair being equally susceptible. The aphids feed from the phloem sieve element content and analyses of this sap in selected maize lines revealed marginally, but significantly higher amino acid levels in Bt maize, which might partially explain the observed increased aphid performance. Larger colony densities of aphids on Bt plants resulted in an increased production of honeydew that can be used as food by beneficial insects. Indeed, Cotesia marginiventris, a parasitoid of lepidopteran pests, lived longer and parasitized more pest caterpillars in the presence of aphid-infested Bt maize than in the presence of aphid-infested isogenic maize. Hence, depending on aphid pest thresholds, the observed increased susceptibility of Bt maize to aphids may be either a welcome or an undesirable side effect...|$|R

It is also {{considered}} as a major pest of sorghum, barley, sugar cane, millet, wheat, and banana {{in various parts of}} the world. This pest is attacked by various predators of different families, viz., Chrysopidae, Syrphidae, and Coccinellidae. Green lacewing, Crysoperla carnea (Stephens) (Chrysopidae), is the most effective biological control agent of aphid species. The larva of C. carnea has relatively a wide range of prey acceptance (Preetha et al., 2009), which includes aphids, whiteflies, eggs of moths, and other soft-bodied insects. As a result of the polyphagous ability and voracious nature of C. carnea in addition to its vast geographical distribution (New, 1975), there is easiness of mass multiplication (Araujo and Bichao, 1990) and tolerance to several pesticides (Hassan et al., 1985). C. carnea has received numerous attentions from farmers as well as researchers as a potential biological pest control agent. The effectiveness of C. carnea as a biological control agent has been demonstrated in field and greenhouses and reported to give about 100 % lepidoptran pest control when used along with Trichogramma spp. (Hagley and Miles, 1987; Rincon, 1999). Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the potential impact of Bt transgenic plants on green lacewing predator, C. carnea.|$|R

The effect of? temperature on the development and the predatory capacity of this chrysopid fed with R. maidis nymphs was investigated. Fresh eggs of C. externa were maintained at 15, 20, 25 or 30 °C under 70 % relative humidity and 12 h photophase, and the duration of the embryonic stage, as well as the duration and viability of the larval (first, second and third instars), prepupal, pupal and adult forms of the predator were evaluated. The duration of each of these stages decreased with increasing temperature, whilst the viabilities of all forms attained 100 % at 20 and 25 °C. The threshold temperature and the value of the thermal constant K obtained for the complete life cycle (egg to adult) were, respectively, 10. 7 °C and 377. 8 degree-days. Independent of temperature, the consumption of R. maidis nymphs by C. externa increased as the larvae reached maturity. At 20 and 25 °C the average number of aphids consumed during the complete larval stage was maximal at approximately 350 specimens. It is concluded, therefore, that the development of the immature forms of C. externa fed on R. maidis as well as its viability and predatory capacity, were favored at temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. 201...|$|R

Total immature stages from birth to adult decreased as temperature increased from 51. 7 d at 6 degrees C to 5. 2 d at 30 degrees C, but became 8. 0 d at 35 degrees C. Overall immature development required 119. 05 degree-days above 4. 44 degrees C. Adult longevity was as high as 26. 7 d at 15 degrees C, but significantly declined at 30 and 35 degrees C. The average adult fecundity was as high as 45 offspring at 15 and 20 degrees C, but dropped to 1. 8 at 6 degrees C and 8. 6 at 30 degrees C. In general, as temperatures increased, age-specific survivorship (I-x) declined more quickly, but age-specific fecundity (m(x)) peaked earlier. At 25 degrees C, the age-specific net maternity was {{the highest in the}} early reproductive period, resulting in the highest intrinsic rates of increase (r(m) = 0. 329). At 20 - 30 degrees C, the values of r(m) were significantly higher than those at lower temperatures. The results indicate that <b>corn</b> leaf <b>aphids</b> probably are better adapted in population growth to a wider range of high temperatures in warm regions...|$|R
40|$|Signaling {{networks}} among multiple phytohormones fine-tune plant defense {{responses to}} insect herbivore attack. Previously, {{it was reported}} that the synergistic combination of ethylene (ET) and jasmonic acid (JA) was required for accumulation of the maize insect resistance 1 (mir 1) gene product, a cysteine (Cys) proteinase that is a key defensive protein against chewing insect pests in maize (Zea mays). However, this study suggests that mir 1 -mediated resistance to <b>corn</b> leaf <b>aphid</b> (CLA; Rhopalosiphum maidis), a phloem sap-sucking insect pest, is independent of JA but regulated by the ET-signaling pathway. Feeding by CLA triggers the rapid accumulation of mir 1 transcripts in the resistant maize genotype, Mp 708. Furthermore, Mp 708 provided elevated levels of antibiosis (limits aphid population) - and antixenosis (deters aphid settling) -mediated resistance to CLA compared with B 73 and Tx 601 maize susceptible inbred lines. Synthetic diet aphid feeding trial bioassays with recombinant Mir 1 -Cys Protease demonstrates that Mir 1 -Cys Protease provides direct toxicity to CLA. Furthermore, foliar feeding by CLA rapidly sends defensive signal(s) to the roots that trigger belowground accumulation of the mir 1, signifying a potential role of long-distance signaling in maize defense against the phloem-feeding insects. Collectively, our data indicate that ET-regulated mir 1 transcript accumulation, uncoupled from JA, contributed to heightened resistance to CLA in maize. In addition, our results underscore the significance of ET acting as a central node in regulating mir 1 expression to different feeding guilds of insect herbivores...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} at the experimental fields of the Crop Science Institute, National Agricultural Research Centre, Islamabad during winter 2003. Inqilab- 91 wheat variety was sown under Randomized Complete Block Design with three replicates. Data were collected through visual count method weekly. Overall aphid morphs distribution of both aphid species was significantly different during season 2003. Population of Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) nymphs peaked to 5. 508 � 1. 22 nymphs/plant during mid March. Apterous and alates population peaked 1. 293 � 0. 486 and 1. 114 � 0. 278 /plant, respectively. Morphs population of Schizaphis graminum (Rondani) including nymphs, apterous and alates peaked to 20. 853 � 2. 35, 3. 516 � 0. 771 and 0. 375 � 0. 077 /plant, respectively. <b>Corn</b> leaf <b>aphid</b> mean population distribution on leaf, stem and spike was significantly different (F 12, 103 = 4. 555, P= 0. 000; F 12, 103 = 5. 367, P= 0. 000; F 12, 103 = 3. 224, P= 0. 001) and non significant on flag leaf (F 12, 103 = 1. 138, P= 0. 340) during crop season.
