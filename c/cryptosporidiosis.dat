5|$|A {{few days}} after the DNC speech, another case of {{shingles}} left scars across his head; within weeks he was hospitalized with <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> causing cryptococcal meningitis. At noon on August 15, 1984, exactly a month after his DNC speech and after 2 days on life support in intensive care, Campbell died at San Francisco General Hospital when his blood pressure dropped rapidly. His parents and his partner Bobby Hilliard were by his side. Campbell was 32 years old and had lived for over 3½ years with what was, by then, called AIDS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryptosporidiosis</b> is a {{parasitic}} disease that is transmitted through contaminated {{food or water}} from an infected person or animal. <b>Cryptosporidiosis</b> in cats is rare, but they can carry the protozoan without showing any signs of illness. <b>Cryptosporidiosis</b> can cause profuse, watery diarrhea with cramping, abdominal pain, and nausea in people. Illness in people is usually self-limiting and lasts only 2–4 days, but can become severe in people with weakened immune systems. <b>Cryptosporidiosis</b> (Cryptosporidium spp.) Cats transmit the protozoan through their feces. The symptoms in people weight loss and chronic diarrhea in high-risk patients. More than one species of this genus can be acquired by people. Dogs can also transmit this parasite.|$|E
25|$|In May 2013, in Roscommon, Ireland, another {{outbreak}} of the <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> was reported and a boil water notice was issued. This {{was the second time}} the parasite was detected in a month in the Roscommon water supply. The source of one of the outbreaks had been linked to the agricultural community. To date, 13 people have been treated for <b>Cryptosporidiosis</b> and the boil water notice is still in effect.|$|E
25|$|Roughly 30% {{of adults}} in the United States are {{seropositive}} for <b>cryptosporidiosis,</b> meaning that they contracted the infection {{at some point in}} their lives.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, a {{waterborne}} <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> outbreak {{occurred in}} Milwaukee, Wisconsin, US. An estimated 403,000 people became ill, including 4,400 people hospitalized. An estimated 69 people {{died during the}} outbreak, according to the CDC.|$|E
25|$|In November 2010, over 4000 {{cases of}} <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> were {{reported}} in Östersund, Sweden. The source of contamination was the tap water. In mid December 2010 the number of reported cases was 12,400 according to local media.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, 13,000 {{people in}} Carrollton, Georgia, United States, became ill with <b>cryptosporidiosis.</b> This {{was the first}} report of its spread through a {{municipal}} water system that met all state and federal drinking water standards.|$|E
25|$|According to one commentator, if the Water Services Bill, 2003, {{had been}} passed earlier and {{implemented}} effectively, people would not now have had to boil their drinking water in Galway in 2007 because of an outbreak of <b>cryptosporidiosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Immunocompetent {{individuals}} with <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> typically suffer a short (i.e., duration {{of less than}} 2 weeks) self-limiting course of diarrhea that may require symptomatic treatment and ends with spontaneous recovery; in some circumstances, antiparasitic medication may be required (e.g., recurrent, severe, or persistent symptoms); however reinfection frequently occurs.|$|E
25|$|In April 2001, an {{outbreak}} {{occurred in the}} city of North Battleford, Saskatchewan, Canada. Between 5800 and 7100 people suffered from diarrheal illness, and 1907 cases of <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> were confirmed. Equipment failures at the city's antiquated water filtration plant following maintenance were found to have caused the outbreak.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, a gym in Cambridge, the United Kingdom, {{was forced}} to close its {{swimming}} pool until further notice after health inspectors found an outbreak of <b>cryptosporidiosis.</b> Environmental Health authorities requested that the water be tested after {{it was confirmed that}} a young man had been infected.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryptosporidiosis</b> {{is found}} worldwide. It causes 50.8% of {{water-borne}} diseases that {{are attributed to}} parasites. In developing countries, 8–19% of diarrheal diseases {{can be attributed to}} Cryptosporidium. Ten percent of the population in developing countries excretes oocysts. In developed countries, the number is lower at 1–3%. The age group most affected are children from 1 to 9 years old.|$|E
25|$|In immunocompromised individuals, such as AIDS patients, <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> {{resolves}} slowly {{or not at}} all, {{and frequently}} causes a particularly severe and persistent form of watery diarrhea coupled with a greatly decreased ability to absorb key nutrients through the intestinal tract. As a result, infected individuals may experience severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, malnutrition, wasting, and potentially death. In general, the mortality rate for infected AIDS patients is based on CD4+ marker counts. Patients with CD4+ counts over 180 cells/mm³ recover with supportive hospital care and medication; but, in patients with CD4+ counts below 50 cells/mm³, the effects are usually fatal within 3 to 6months. During the Milwaukee <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> epidemic (the largest of its kind), 73% of AIDS patients with CD4+ counts lower than 50 cells/mm³ and 36% of those with counts between 50 and 200 cells/mm³ died within {{the first year of}} contracting the infection.|$|E
25|$|In October 2005, the Gwynedd and Anglesey {{areas of}} North Wales, the United Kingdom, {{suffered}} {{an outbreak of}} <b>cryptosporidiosis.</b> The outbreak may {{have been linked to}} the drinking water supply from Llyn Cwellyn, but this is not yet confirmed. As a result, 231 people fell ill and the company Welsh Water (Dwr Cymru) advised 61,000 people to boil their water before use.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2008; many public {{swimming}} areas, water parks, and public pools in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex of Texas suffered an outbreak of <b>cryptosporidiosis.</b> Burger's Lake in Fort Worth {{was the first to}} report such an outbreak. This prompted some, if not all, city-owned and private pools to close and hyperchlorinate. To the 13 August 2008 there were 400 reported cases of Cryptosporidium.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to other}} rodents, brown rats may carry {{a number of}} pathogens, which can result in disease, {{including}} Weil's disease, rat bite fever, <b>cryptosporidiosis,</b> viral hemorrhagic fever, Q fever and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. In the United Kingdom, brown rats are an important reservoir for Coxiella burnetii, the bacterium that causes Q fever, with seroprevalence for the bacteria found to {{be as high as}} 53% in some wild populations.|$|E
25|$|Since May 2011, {{there has}} been an ongoing {{outbreak}} in South Roscommon in Ireland. Although many people have been diagnosed with <b>cryptosporidiosis,</b> the source of the parasite has not yet been found. Testing continues and Roscommon County Council are now considering introducing Ultra Violet Filtration to their water treatment process in the next 12 months. Residents are being advised to boil the tap water and {{there is no sign of}} this boil notice being lifted in the near future.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryptosporidiosis,</b> {{also known}} as crypto, is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by Cryptosporidium, a genus of protozoan parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa. It affects the distal small intestine and can affect the respiratory tract in both immunocompetent (i.e., individuals with a normal functioning immune system) and immunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS or autoimmune disorders) individuals, resulting in watery diarrhea with or without an unexplained cough. In immunocompromised individuals, the symptoms are particularly severe and can be fatal. It is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water; recent evidence suggests that {{it can also be}} transmitted via fomites in respiratory secretions.|$|E

He also lobbied Margaret Heckler, Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Reagan administration over both practical issues and stigmatising medical practices affecting people with AIDS. He also continued to campaign for LGBT+ rights, speaking outside the 1984 Democratic National Convention a month before his death from <b>cryptosporidiosis.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Polymerase chain {{reaction}} (PCR) {{is another way}} to diagnose <b>cryptosporidiosis.</b> [...] It can even identify the specific species of Cryptosporidium. [...] If the patient is thought to have biliary <b>cryptosporidiosis,</b> then an appropriate diagnostic technique is ultrasonography. [...] If that returns normal results, the next step would be to perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.|$|E
2500|$|In immunocompetent individuals, <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> is {{primarily}} localized to the {{distal small intestine}} and sometimes the respiratory tract as well. [...] In immunocompromised persons, <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> may disseminate to other organs, including the hepatobiliary system, pancreas, upper gastrointestinal tract, and urinary bladder; pancreatic and biliary infection can involve acalculous cholecystitis, sclerosing cholangitis, papillary stenosis, or pancreatitis.|$|E

2500|$|Cases of <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> {{can occur}} {{in a city that}} does not have a {{contaminated}} water supply. In a city with clean water, it may be that cases of <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> have different origins. Testing of water, as well as epidemiological study, are necessary to determine the sources of specific infections. Cryptosporidium is causing serious illness [...] more frequently in immunocompromised than in apparently healthy individuals. It may chronically sicken some children, as well as adults who are exposed and immunocompromised. A subset of the immunocompromised population is people with AIDS. Some sexual behaviors can transmit the parasite directly.|$|E
2500|$|In the US the law {{requires}} doctors and labs to report cases of <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> to local or state health departments. [...] These departments then report to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. [...] The best way to prevent getting and spreading <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> is to have good hygiene and sanitation. [...] An example would be hand-washing. [...] Prevention is through washing hands carefully after {{going to the bathroom}} or contacting stool, and before eating. [...] People should avoid contact with animal feces. [...] They should also avoid possibly contaminated food and water. [...] In addition, people should refrain from engaging in sexual activities that can expose them to feces.|$|E
2500|$|... {{nitazoxanide}} is {{the only}} antiparasitic drug treatment with proven efficacy for <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> in immunocompetent individuals; however, it lacks efficacy in severely immunocompromised patients. Certain agents such as paromomycin and azithromycin are sometimes used as well, but they only have partial efficacy.|$|E

2500|$|People with <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> {{should not}} swim in {{communal}} areas because the pathogen can {{reside in the}} anal and genital areas and be washed off. [...] They should wait until {{at least two weeks}} after diarrhea stops before entering public water sources, since oocysts can still be shed for a while. [...] Also, they should stay away from immunosuppressed people. [...] Immunocompromised people should take care to protect themselves from water in lakes and streams. [...] They should also stay away from animal stools and wash their hands after touching animals. [...] To be safe, they should boil or filter their water. [...] They should also wash and cook their vegetables.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cryptosporidiosis</b> {{may occur}} as an {{asymptomatic}} infection, an acute infection (i.e., duration shorter than 2weeks), as recurrent acute infections in which symptoms reappear following {{a brief period}} of recovery for up to 30days, and as a chronic infection (i.e., duration longer than 2weeks) in which symptoms are severe and persistent. It may be fatal in individuals with a severely compromised immune system. Symptoms usually appear 5–10days after infection (range: 2–28days) and normally last for up to 2weeks in immunocompetent individuals; symptoms are usually more severe and persist longer in immunocompromised individuals.

2500|$|Complex {{plastids}} {{start by}} secondary endosymbiosis (where a eukaryotic organism engulfs another eukaryotic organism {{that contains a}} primary plastid resulting in its endosymbiotic fixation), when a eukaryote engulfs a red or green alga and retains the algal plastid, which is typically surrounded by more than two membranes. In some cases these plastids may be reduced in their metabolic and/or photosynthetic capacity. [...] Algae with complex plastids derived by secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga include the heterokonts, haptophytes, cryptomonads, and most dinoflagellates (= rhodoplasts). Those that endosymbiosed a green alga include the euglenids and chlorarachniophytes (= chloroplasts). The Apicomplexa, a phylum of obligate parasitic protozoa including the causative agents of malaria (Plasmodium spp.), toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma gondii), and many other human or animal diseases also harbor a complex plastid (although this organelle has been lost in some apicomplexans, such as Cryptosporidium parvum, which causes <b>cryptosporidiosis).</b> [...] The 'apicoplast' is no longer capable of photosynthesis, but is an essential organelle, and a promising target for antiparasitic drug development.|$|E

2500|$|Contact with {{farm animals}} {{can lead to}} disease in farmers or others that {{come into contact with}} {{infected}} animals. [...] Glanders primarily affects those who work closely with horses and donkeys. Close contact with cattle can lead to cutaneous anthrax infection, whereas inhalation anthrax infection is more common for workers in slaughterhouses, tanneries and wool mills. Close contact with sheep who have recently given birth can lead to clamydiosis, or enzootic abortion, in pregnant women, as well as an increased risk of Q fever, toxoplasmosis, and listeriosis in pregnant or the otherwise immunocompromised. Echinococcosis is caused by a tapeworm which can be spread from infected sheep by food or water contaminated with feces or wool. Bird flu is common in chickens. While rare in humans, the main public health worry is that a strain of bird flu will recombine with a human flu virus and cause a pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu. In 2017, free range chickens in the UK were temporarily ordered to remain inside due to the threat of bird flu. Cattle are an important reservoir of <b>cryptosporidiosis</b> and mainly affects the immunocompromised.|$|E
