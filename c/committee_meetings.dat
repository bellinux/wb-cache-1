5|$|After {{stepping}} down as chairman, he was unanimously elected to an honorary position of president, a role he kept until 1894, {{and was named}} the first-ever life member of the League in 1895. The role {{was that of a}} figurehead with little actual authority, but he was used as a mediator to resolve league disagreements. In {{the second half of the}} decade McGregor's failure to attend many <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> led to criticism from John Bentley, his successor as president. Bentley's criticism achieved the desired effect; from 1899 until his health deteriorated in 1910, McGregor seldom missed a meeting. During this period McGregor was noted for his reserved nature. He was silent for large parts of <b>committee</b> <b>meetings,</b> but would contribute enthusiastically on the occasions he felt his input was necessary.|$|E

5|$|C-SPAN Radio {{broadcasts}} public-affairs programming, {{including some}} audio simulcasts of C-SPAN's flagship television programs like Washington Journal and some radio-only programming {{such as the}} famous tape-recorded Oval Office conversations from the Johnson and Nixon administrations, oral histories, and some <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> and press conferences not shown on television due to programming commitments. The radio station does not try to duplicate C-SPAN television coverage, and takes a more selective approach to its broadcast content. Regular programs broadcast on the radio station include Today in Washington and Prime Minister's Question Time. The station also broadcasts full gavel-to-gavel coverage of political conventions in election years.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the work}} of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee. The role of {{committees}} is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for {{the fact that there is}} no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. <b>Committee</b> <b>meetings</b> take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.|$|E

A protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam requires that 12 plenary sessions be held in Strasbourg (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> are held in Brussels. Luxembourg hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is the only assembly {{in the world with}} more than one meeting place {{and one of the few}} that does not have the power to decide its own location.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the three television networks, C-SPAN also broadcasts via C-SPAN Radio, which is carried on their owned-and-operated station WCSP (90.1 FM) in the Washington, D.C. area with all three cable network feeds airing via HD Radio subchannels, and nationwide on XM Satellite Radio. Its programming is also livestreamed at c-span.org and is available via apps for iPhone, BlackBerry and Android devices. C-SPAN Radio has a selective policy regarding its broadcast content, rather than duplicating the television network programming, although it does offer some audio simulcasts of programs such as Washington Journal. Unique programming on the radio station includes oral histories, and some <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> and press conferences not shown on television due to programming commitments. The station also compiles the Sunday morning talk shows for a same-day rebroadcast without commercials, in rapid succession.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, 2016, Bevin {{released}} a video {{on social media}} claiming that House Democrats were not following through on their obligations to help craft the state budget. Legislators responded with a photo and statements that while Bevin was producing his film designed to chastise them, House leaders were in fact in <b>committee</b> <b>meetings</b> working out details of a budget proposal while Speaker Stumbo suggested the Governor was either unfamiliar with the legislative process, or intended to deceive people. On March 12, House Democrats released their own budget, which sustained most of the cuts to executive agencies in Bevin's budget, but exempted public universities from any cuts. The Republican-controlled Senate countered with a proposal that hewed closely to Bevin's original budget.|$|E

5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. <b>Committee</b> <b>meetings</b> on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} Central <b>Committee</b> <b>{{meetings}}</b> rose again during Brezhnev's early tenure as elected First Secretary, {{but the number}} of meetings and their duration steadily decreased during Brezhnev's rule. Before Stalin's consolidation of power, the Central Committee featured open debate, where even leading officials could be criticised. This did not occur during the Brezhnev era, and Politburo officials rarely participated in its meetings; from 1966 to 1976, Alexei Kosygin, Podgorny and Mikhail Suslov attended a Central Committee meeting once; it was in 1973 to ratify the Soviet Union's treaty with West Germany. No Politburo or Secretariat members during the Brezhnev era were speakers during Central <b>Committee</b> <b>meetings.</b> The speaker at the Central Committee meeting which elected the Council of Ministers (the Government) and the Politburo was never listed during the Brezhnev era.|$|E
