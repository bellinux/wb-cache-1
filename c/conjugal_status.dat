40|$|The present work {{employs a}} multivariate {{analysis}} technique to study, simultaneously, family relations and alcohol/drug consumption among 16 378 Brazilian high-school students. {{the analysis is}} centered on the relation between subjective or objective family situations and consumption. Subjective situations are measured by adolescents' perception of their families, that is, the family's environmental ''climate''-whether violent situations occur at home, whether there is frequent dialogue about the youngsters' problems, and whether they perceive interest {{on the part of}} parents. Objective situations refer to the <b>conjugal</b> <b>status</b> of parents. Results pointed to family violence as the factor most frequently associated with alcohol/drug use behavior. It was also found that the family's environmental climate constitutes a more important factor than the <b>conjugal</b> <b>status</b> of parents, {{when it comes to the}} development of drug use behavior. Therefore, the impact of this last variable (whether parents are living together) is determined by environmental conditions: when those conditions are favorable (no violence, problems habitually talked about, parents concerned with their offspring) the fact that parents were effectively living together meant a smaller probability of alcohol/drug use; when these conditions were unfavorable, the same fact was associated with a greater probability of consumption.

40|$|OBJETIVO: avaliar o conhecimento, a atitude e a prática do autoexame das mamas (AEM) em mulheres do município de São Luís (MA) e os fatores sociodemográficos relacionados. MÉTODOS: estudo transversal, prospectivo, com amostragem por conglomerados, no qual foram incluídas 552 mulheres de 14 setores censitários em São Luís, no período de Janeiro a Setembro de 2003. O conhecimento, a atitude e a prática (variáveis dependentes) foram avaliados pela análise das respostas das mulheres em "adequado" ou "inadequado". As principais variáveis independentes foram: idade, escolaridade, renda {{familiar}}, situação <b>conjugal</b> e <b>status</b> menopausal. Foi realizado o teste do &# 967; 2 para a associação entre variáveis categóricas e a mensuração do Odds Ratio (OR) bruto e ajustado após análise multivariada por regressão logística. RESULTADOS: embora 1 / 3 da população estudada não tivesse conhecimento do AEM, o grupo de mulheres que eram informadas sobre a existência do exame possuía conhecimento (60, 9 %), prática (59, 5 %) e atitude (90 %) adequados. O histórico familiar para câncer de mama (8, 9 %) não esteve associado a maior conhecimento e prática. A mídia mostrou-se de grande importância (63, 6 %) na disseminação da informação do AEM. Após análise multivariada, a mulher com parceiro (OR= 1, 9) apresentou maior adequação do conhecimento; o grupo de mulheres com idade maior que 50 anos (OR= 11, 7) teve melhor atitude quanto ao AEM; a escolaridade maior que cinco anos (OR= 2) e mulher com parceiro (OR= 1, 7) estiveram associadas à prática mais correta do AEM. CONCLUSÃO: a maioria das pacientes conhece e pratica o AEM em São Luís e a atitude delas frente ao procedimento é extremamente positiva. Houve uma grande participação da mídia na propagação da informação sobre o AEM. PURPOSE: {{to assess}} the knowledge, attitude and practice of breast self-examination (BSE) of women from the municipality of São Luís (MA), Brazil, and associated socio-demographic variables. METHODS: prospective and cross-sectional study, with conglomerate sampling, in which 552 women from 14 census sections of São Luís were included {{during the period from}} January to September 2003. The knowledge, attitude and practice (dependent variables) were evaluated by means of analysis of the responses of the women as "adequate" or "inadequate". The main independent variables were: age, schooling, family income and marital and menopausal status. The &# 967; 2 test was used to determine the association between categorical variables and the measurement of the crude/adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) after multivariate analysis by means of logistic regression. RESULTS: although 1 / 3 of the studied population did not know about BSE, the group of women who were informed about it showed adequate knowledge (60. 9 %), practice (59. 5 %) and attitude (90 %). The family history of breast cancer (8. 9 %) was not associated with better knowledge and practice. The media (63. 6 %) was found to be important in disseminating information about BSE. After multivariate analysis, women with a partner (OR= 1. 9) presented more adequate knowledge; women older than 50 years (OR= 11. 7) had a better attitude towards BSE; women with more than five years of schooling (OR= 2) and with a partner (OR= 1. 7) were associated with a more correct practice of BSE. CONCLUSION: most of the patients know and practice the BSE in São Luís and their attitude towards the procedure is extremely positive. There was a great participation of the media in the dissemination of information concerning BSE...|$|R

Results also show that a past history of one of these two types of migration in a given community has a positive association with future practice of that same type of migration while it has no effect or a negative effect on the other type of migration. ^ Further qualitative and quantitative analysis studies migrant success indicators (job and housing acquisition) and urban-rural interactions (remittances, rural visits, network formation, return migration) conditional on whether an adult male migrant was married with spouse present in the city, married with spouse living in his village, or unmarried (referred to as <b>conjugal</b> <b>status).</b> This analysis serves four functions: (1) Demonstrates the importance of migrant <b>conjugal</b> <b>status</b> as a primary stratifying variable, not merely a main effect, when modeling post-migration behaviors.

40|$|Background: Postpartum {{depression}} (PPD) is {{a widespread}} worldwide phenomenon, but its etiology remains unclear. This study reappraised how evolutionary theory could explain PPD as an adaptation through investigating the relationship between maternal age and PPD, and if this relationship is modified according {{to the number of}} children at home. Methods: A cross-sectional study carried out in five primary health care units included 811 participants randomly selected among mothers of children up to five postpartum months in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Postpartum depression was defined by scores above 11 on Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and statistical analysis was based on multivariate logistic regression models. Results: One hundred and ninety-seven (24. 3 %, CI 95 % 21. 3 ??? 27. 2) participants were classified as PPD positives. Maternal age was significantly associated to PPD (OR?? 0. 96, p-value?? 0. 019) independently of socioeconomic and reproductive characteristics, <b>conjugal</b> <b>status</b> or substance consumption by the couple. Thus, for each additional year, a reduction of 4 % in the chance of developing PPD could be anticipated, effect which was not modified by the number of children at home (p-value?? 0. 602). Limitations: Information on social support was not included in this analysis since its relationship with maternal mental health would be better evaluated in a prospective fashion. Conclusions: These findings suggest that adaptive mechanisms shaped through human generations persist contributing to the development of PPD in contemporary societies. According to this evolutionary approach, as maternal age advances the reproductive potential diminishes and, consequently, mothers are less prone to develop PPD and reduce investment in new offspring...|$|E
40|$|Background : The {{diffusion}} of cohabitation and, presumably, of childbearing within cohabitation, inspires interest in measuring the respective contribution of childbearing within marriage and within cohabitation to overall fertility. However, {{there is no}} consensus on a proper way to do so. Objective : Contribute to the development of tools for assessing the relative importance of marriage and cohabitation to overall fertility by developing period measures closely related to age-specific fertility rates and the total fertility rate. Methods : We introduce two measures: 1) the contribution of the conjugal state (living alone, living in a cohabiting union, being married) to age-specific fertility rates (CASFR) and 2) the contribution of the conjugal state to the TFR (CTFR). These measures are similar in construction to the marital (legitimate) fertility rates and marital (legitimate) TFR, but they are weighted by the proportion of women living alone, cohabiting, or being married at each age, so that their sum is the overall TFR. Taken together, they represent the fertility of the average woman of a synthetic cohort who moves across the various conjugal states (living alone, cohabiting, being married) over her life course. They provide "realistic" estimates of completed fertility within each conjugal state. Conclusions : CASFRs provide a description of the fertility, over her life course, of a synthetic woman who would have spent her reproductive years living alone, cohabiting, and being married as the average woman of the synthetic cohort. CTFR provides a decomposition of the cumulative fertility of this synthetic woman. Over her life course, she would have had exactly the number of children computed using the overall TFR, but CTFR details the proportion of these children she would have had while living alone, while cohabiting, and while being married. Comments : Despite being defined as a conditional ASR weighted by the age-specific proportion of women living alone, cohabiting, or being married, computing the CASFR does not require that one know the population distribution of women by <b>conjugal</b> <b>status,</b> as this quantity cancels out. As a consequence, CASFR and CTFR may be computed without this information, as the parity-specific ASFR may be computed without knowing the population distribution of women by parity...|$|E

Pregnancy and childbirth {{can have an}} influence on the muscles and pelvic floor and can cause morbidities of women`s genito-urinary tract. Design. A prospective cohort study. Methods. There were included 226 primigravidae women, attended by community health services {{in the city of}} Itapecerica da Serra, Sao Paulo, Brazil. The participants were followed in four stages: (1) within 12 weeks of pregnancy; (2) between 36 - 40 weeks of pregnancy; (3) within 48 hours after childbirth; (4) 42 - 60 days after childbirth. Data were collected from February 2007 -August 2008. The pelvic floor musculature strength was evaluated by perineometry and digital vaginal palpation in stages 1, 2 and 4. The final sample included 110 women who completed all four stages of the study. Results. The pelvic floor musculature strength of the women did not change significantly during pregnancy or after delivery (anova: p = 0 center dot 78). In all three examined stages, a low-intensity pelvic floor musculature strength was prevalent (in mmHg: stage 1 = 15 center dot 9; stage 2 = 15 center dot 2, stage 4 = 14 center dot 7), with scores from 0 - 3 on the Oxford scale. The pelvic floor musculature strength did not differ in relation to maternal age, skin colour, <b>conjugal</b> <b>status,</b> dyspareunia, stool characteristics, type of delivery, or conditions of the perineum. An interaction between maternal nutritional state and newborn`s weight may affect the pelvic floor musculature strength (manova: p = 0 center dot 04). Conclusion. Pregnancy and childbirth did not reduce significantly pelvic floor musculature strength. The perineometry and digital vaginal palpation used to assess the pelvic floor musculature strength were well accepted by the women. Relevance to clinical practice. In clinical practice, digital vaginal palpation is effective for supporting the diagnosis of urinary, intestinal and sexual dysfunctions. Perineometry use is particularly important together with the performance of perineal exercises with biofeedback in the treatment these disorders.

40|$|Gender-based {{war crimes}} have {{occurred}} for 				centuries and, until the modern development of ad hoc tribunals, had been 				largely {{ignored by the}} international community and viewed as inevitable 				consequences of war.

The most recent gender-based 				international criminal prosecutions took place in the SCSL trials of the 				leaders of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) and the Revolutionary 				United Front (RUF). During the 				armed conflict, soldiers forced women and girls to marry members of their 				group.

For the first time in history, a court found military leaders guilty of 				committing other inhumane acts through forced marriage. Forced marriage subjects women to a 				particular psychological and moral suffering different than that experienced by 				victims of rape or sexual slavery. This 				discrepancy results from the fact that forced marriage involves forced <b>conjugal</b> 				<b>status</b> but may not always be sexual in nature. 				Therefore, it is wholly inappropriate to subsume incidences of forced 				marriage under the current crimes against humanity paradigm failing to specify 				forced marriage as one of the other inhumane acts constituting such 				crimes. The SCSL decisions noted the 				importance of charging crimes based on the uniquely damaging practice of forced 				marriage rather than merely focusing on certain commonalities within the 				offenses and charging individuals with either rape or sexual slavery. Not only has the acknowledgment of forced 				marriage as a crime against humanity helped advance the cause of women in, 				but these decisions are also significant for their potential impact on the 				prosecution of atrocities in the International Criminal Court (ICC). Every situation the ICC is investigating 				involves reports of forced marriages. 				Continued acknowledgement of the specific crime of forced marriage will 				only further the cause of women around the world, and the charge of forced marriage 				should therefore be recognized by the ICC as a new and independent crime 				against humanity...|$|E

O presente estudo objetivou estimar valores de referência para os diferentes domínios de qualidade de vida incluídos no Questionário da Universidade de Washington sobre Qualidade de Vida (UW-QOL, 4 ª edição) para pessoas sem câncer e comparar estes valores com aqueles obtidos para os pacientes com câncer de boca e orofaringe em estágio pré-cirúrgico. Para estimar os valores de referência foram entrevistados 141 pacientes atendidos nos ambulatórios do Hospital Heliópolis, pareados por sexo e idade com 47 pacientes com câncer de boca e orofaringe em estágio pré-cirúrgico, atendidos no mesmo hospital. A média global e os escores específicos dos domínios de qualidade de vida podem variar de 0 a 100, com valores mais elevados indicando melhor condição funcional. A pontuação média de QV para pacientes sem câncer foi 91, 1. Essa medida foi significantemente (p< 0, 01) mais elevada que para os pacientes com câncer, cuja pontuação global foi 80, 6. Para os pacientes sem câncer, os escores de ombros, recreação ansiedade e mastigação foram modificados por sexo, estado conjugal, renda, grau de instrução e presença de problemas na boca. A pequena redução dos valores de referência, em relação aos parâmetros máximos passíveis de aferição (100 %) indica favoravelmente a especificidade do questionário. No entanto, nem toda redução de QV dos pacientes com câncer de boca e orofaringe pode ser atribuída à doença ou ao tratamento, pois uma redução do escore médio global de cerca de 9 % pode ser decorrente de perdas naturais sofridas pelos indivíduos ao longo da vida. Os domínios dor, aparência, deglutição, fala, paladar e ansiedade apresentaram escores significantemente mais reduzidos nos pacientes com câncer de boca e orofaringe que nos pacientes não afetados pela doença. The self {{report of}} quality of life, for {{patients}} with head and neck cancer is documented by questionnaires assessing {{the impact of the}} disease and its treatment on several physiological, psychological and social domains. This study aimed at assessing reference values for quality of life domains comprised by the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL, 4 th edition) for persons without cancer, and comparing their answers with results obtained for patients with oral and oropharyngeal cancer previoulsly to the primary surgery of tumor resection. A total of 141 patients attended at outpatients units of the Heliópolis Hospital were interviewed to assess reference values for the UW-QOL questionnaire, paired by sex and age with 47 patients hospitalized for surgery of oral and oropharyngeal cancer in the same hospital. Overall and domain specific ratings for QOL can vary from 0 to 100, with higher figures for improved functional status. The overall rating of QOL for patients without cancer was 91. 1. This rating was significantly (p< 0. 01) higher than the corresponding figure for patients affected by cancer, whose global score was 80. 6. For patients without cancer, ratings for shoulders, recreation, anxiety and chewing were modified by sex, <b>conjugal</b> <b>status,</b> income, instruction and the self-report of problems in the mouth. The small reduction of reference values, in relation to the maximum parameters that may be assessed (100 %) suggests that the questionnaire is specific for head and neck cancer. However, the reduction of QOL for patients with oral and oropharyngeal cancer should not be entirely attributed to the disease and its treatment, because nearly 9 % of reduction in QOL ratings may be due to other causes associated with the aging process. Pain, appearance, swallowing, speech, taste and anxiety were the QOL domains with ratings significantly lower for patients with oral and oropharyngeal cancer, in the comparison with those not affected by the disease...|$|E
40|$|Introdu??o: A paternidade na vida do homem representa momento de grande mudan?a caracterizado, principalmente, por pap?is sociais que determinam o comportamento adulto masculino perante a fam?lia e a sociedade. A ideia de ?pai provedor? influenciou e, ainda, tem influenciado o comportamento do homem frente ? paternidade. Por outro lado, a figura do ?novo pai? se caracterizou a partir do rompimento com o modelo tradicional de paternidade e do desenvolvimento de v?nculos afetivos no trin?mio pai-m?e-filhos. Assim, percebe-se que a forma de conceber e vivenciar a paternidade decorre de transforma??es hist?ricas. Neste sentido, compreendendo a paternidade como constru??o social que se forma a partir de processos identit?rios da figura masculina e concep??es de g?nero, o estudo em quest?o sustenta-se na Teoria da Identidade Social com enfoque da Psicologia S?cio-hist?rica. Objetivo Geral: Analisar as repercuss?es da constru??o da identidade paterna na ades?o ao pr?-natal masculino. M?todo: Tratou-se de um estudo com abordagem qualitativa. Participaram 40 homens-pais, na faixa et?ria entre de 22 e 47 anos, tempo de parentalidade m?nimo de 1 ano, relacionamento est?vel, e classes sociais diversas. Crit?rios de inclus?o: ser homem-pai adulto, n?o ser pai adolescente, nem av?, uma vez que se acredita existir peculiaridades nestas situa??es as quais n?o se enquadram como foco do estudo em quest?o. Os participantes foram selecionados de forma aleat?ria, sendo respeitados os crit?rios de inclus?o no estudo e concord?ncia em {{responder}} os instrumentos. Instrumentos: 1) Entrevista Semiestruturada: com o intuito de apreender discursos acerca das viv?ncias e concep??es da paternidade; 2) Question?rio sociodemogr?fico: que buscou levantar dados acerca da idade, renda, tempo de relacionamento, status conjugal, n?mero de filhos e escolaridade. O estudo foi submetido e aprovado pelo Comit? de ?tica em Pesquisa da Secretaria de Estado da Sa?de da Para?ba ? CEP/SES-PB. Ap?s a aprova??o ?tica e a assinatura do Termo de Consentimento Livre e Esclarecido pelos participantes, procedeu-se a coleta dos dados. As entrevistas foram processadas por An?lise Categorial Tem?tica, proposta por Figueiredo (1993), a qual consiste na rela??o dos discursos emergentes com as vari?veis tem?ticas de interesse. Resultados: A partir da an?lise dos relatos dos participantes, emergiram duas classes tem?ticas e dez categorias. A Classe Tem?tica I Paternidade foi composta pelas categorias: Transforma??o, Pap?is, Responsabilidade, Realiza??o e Limita??es. A Classe Tem?tica II Sa?de Reprodutiva foi composta pelas categorias: Pr?-natal, Pr?-natal masculino, Participa??o masculina, Servi?os de sa?de e Obst?culos. Considera??es finais: A paternidade enquanto constru??o social ? moldada conforme o tempo hist?rico em transi??o. A identidade paterna ? tida como algo em constante transforma??o a depender do contexto s?cio-hist?rico do homem, neste sentido, a forma com a qual o homem foi socializado vai implicar necessariamente na sua identidade paterna. Enquanto estrat?gia de interven??o de uma pol?tica p?blica de sa?de, o pr?-natal masculino deve, ent?o, contemplar o sentido hist?rico da paternidade e os significados atribu?dos a este momento da vida masculina para que assim melhor se efetive a sua implementa??o e, consequentemente, a ades?o masculina. Introduction: Fatherhood in man?s life represents {{moment of}} big change characterized, mainly, for social roles which determine the male adult behavior before {{the family and}} society. The idea of ?provider father? influenced and still has influenced the man?s behavior before fatherhood. On the other hand, {{the figure of the}} ?new father? characterized from the break up with the traditional model of fatherhood and of the development of affective bonds in the trinomial father-mother-children. Thus, one realizes that the way to conceive and experience fatherhood results from historical transformations. In this sense, understanding the fatherhood as a social construction which formed from identity processes of the male figure and conceptions of genre, the study in question rests on the Social Identity Theory with the focus of Socio-historical Psychology. General Objective: To analyze the repercussions of the construction of paternal identity in the adherence to male prenatal. Method: This was a qualitative study. 40 men-fathers participated, ranging in age from 22 to 47 years, parenting time minimum of 1 year, stable relationship, and different social classes. Inclusion criteria: to be adult man-father and not to be teenager father, nor grandfather once believed to exist peculiarities in these situations which do not fit with the focus of the study in question. Participants were selected randomly, being respected the inclusion criteria in the study and agreement in answering the instruments. Instruments: 1) Semi-structured interview: realized in order to apprehend discourses about the experiences and conceptions of fatherhood; 2) Socio-demographic questionnaire: that sought to collect data on the age, income, time of relationship, <b>conjugal</b> <b>status,</b> number of children and education. The study was submitted and approved by the Ethics in Research of the State Department of Health of Para?ba ? CEP/SES-PB. After ethical approval and signing of Term of Informed Consent by the participants, it proceeded to collect data.
