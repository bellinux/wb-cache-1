To fund such programs, Congress approved on April 12, 2003, a 2. 48 billion Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF) in the FY 2003 Supplemental Appropriation. On November 6, 2003, the President signed into law P. L. 108 - 106, the FY 2004 Emergency Supplemental Appropriation, providing 18. 4 billion for Iraq reconstruction. <b>Contributions</b> <b>pledged</b> at the October 24, 2003, Madrid donor conference by other donors amounted to roughly 3. 6 billion in grant aid {{and as much as}} 13. 3 billion in possible loans.

[...] All members of the Google board received subpoeanas. In the case of Tilghman, [...] "records of donations, <b>contribution</b> <b>pledges</b> or promises made by Tilghman or the university to any charities, organizations, foundations or educational institutions that have any affiliation with Page, Brin, Schmidt or Google" [...] were demanded.|$|R
5000|$|The {{contributions}} that each individual country should make {{in order to}} achieve the worldwide goal are determined by all countries individually and called [...] "nationally determined contributions" [...] (NDCs). Article 3 requires them to be [...] "ambitious", [...] "represent a progression over time" [...] and set [...] "with the view to achieving the purpose of this Agreement". The contributions should be reported every five years and are to be registered by the UNFCCC Secretariat. Each further ambition should be more ambitious than the previous one, known as the principle of 'progression'. Countries can cooperate and pool their nationally determined contributions. The Intended Nationally Determined <b>Contributions</b> <b>pledged</b> during the 2015 Climate Change Conference serve—unless provided otherwise—as the initial Nationally determined contribution.|$|R

2500|$|During the {{rebuilding}} of the Filene Center between 1982 and 1984, Wolf Trap received $29 million in <b>contributions</b> and <b>pledges</b> from [...] over 16,000 donors in 47 states and five foreign countries, including a $9 million grant from Congress and support from then-President Ronald Reagan and former Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. [...] WETA-TV also sponsored a star-studded, three-hour national telethon that raised more than $390,000 for {{the reconstruction of the}} Filene Center.|$|R
50|$|During the {{transmission}} of the event especially in the television broadcasting many Mexican media personalities shows testimonies of {{children and their families}} who overcame their disabilities. The final act with the Telethon is a concert in the Estadio Azteca with the performance of many national and international artists and singers. Because Televisa programming also airs in the United States on Univision and border city Televisa stations, some additional <b>contributions</b> and <b>pledges</b> come from American viewers.|$|R

50|$|Public {{broadcasting}} includes radio, {{television and}} other electronic media outlets whose primary mission is public service. In {{much of the}} world, funding comes from the government, especially via annual fees charged on receivers. In the United States, public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources, but generally most financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses ranging from small shops to corporations, along with audience <b>contributions</b> via <b>pledge</b> drives. The great majority are operated as private not-for-profit corporations.|$|R
25|$|The numbers {{below are}} the <b>pledged</b> <b>contributions.</b> Arguably, only funds that are {{actually}} transferred should be counted. For example, after the Bam earthquake in December 2003, the Iranian government received only US$17.5 million from the US$1 billion of international donations that had been promised.|$|R
50|$|The {{time had}} come for a {{permanent}} home for the community. Cooper set about raising the funds to realise his vision, and, after substantial <b>contributions</b> were <b>pledged,</b> the present estate of some nine acres was purchased. He chose the site partly because of its mild climate and beautiful surroundings and partly because it is adjacent to Dormans railway station and so within easy reach of London. The foundation stone of the building was laid in July 1900 and the West wing and administrative block were opened the following year. Over time the buildings continued to be developed {{with the addition of}} the East wing and an extension to the Chapel.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, Fritz {{became the}} first non-incumbent to {{successfully}} run under Portland's public financing system. She took the most votes in the May primary election (43%) {{in a field of}} six candidates, and faced second-place finisher Charles Lewis (13%) in a November runoff election. Fritz and Lewis were among the candidates who each qualified for $150,000 in public financing by collecting over 1,000 five-dollar <b>contributions,</b> and <b>pledging</b> to accept no other campaign contributions. Each received an additional $200,000 for the runoff election. Fritz defeated Lewis with 70% of the vote in the runoff. Fritz was also the first candidate to qualify for public funds under the program, in her first race, when she challenged incumbent Dan Saltzman in the 2006 election. In the 2008 race, her decisive victory in the primary enabled her to reach out to new classes of constituents; she was noted for expanding her appeal from neighborhood activists to the business community, and placing a strong emphasis on fiscal responsibility.|$|R

50|$|The Trustees {{meeting of}} March 1808 {{determined}} that funds thus far {{collected from the}} subscribers was not sufficient {{for the construction of}} a two story stone house measuring 5o ft. long by 25 ft. wide. A plan was adopted to reduce the size of the initial construction to 31 ft. by 25 ft. and enlarge the building to 50 ft. by 25 ft. when more funds were available. The Treasurer was instructed by the Trustees to call upon each subscriber to pay one-half their <b>pledged</b> <b>contribution</b> immediately and the balance within three months.

40|$|Each country’s Intended Nationally Determined <b>Contribution</b> (INDC) <b>pledges</b> an {{emission}} target for 2025 or 2030. Here, we evaluated the INDC intergenerational and interregional equity by comparing scenarios with INDC {{emission target}} in 2030 {{and with an}} immediate emission reduction associated with a global uniform carbon price using AIM/CGE (Asian-Pacific Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium). Both scenarios eventually achieve 2 °C target. The results showed that, as compared with an immediate emission reduction scenario, the intergenerational equity status is not favorable for INDC scenario and the future generation suffers more from delayed mitigation. Moreover, this conclusion was robust to {{the wide range of}} inequality aversion parameter that determines discount rate. On the other hand, the INDC scenario has better interregional equity {{in the early part of}} the century than does the immediate emission reduction scenario in which we assume a global carbon price during the period up to 2030. However, interregional equity worsens later in the century. The additional emission reduction to the INDC in 2030 would improve both inter- and interregional equity as compared to the current INDC. We also suggest that countries should commit to more emission reductions in the follow-up INDC communications and that continuous consideration for low-income countries is needed for global climate change cooperation after 2030...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} an {{international}} ‘Low-Emissions Technology Commitment’ should {{be incorporated into}} the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiation process in order to promote innovation that will enable deep decarbonization. The goal is to accelerate research, development, and demonstration of safe, scalable, and affordable low-emissions energy technologies. Such a commitment should be based on three elements. First, it should operate within existing UNFCCC negotiations so as to encourage developed states to offer directed funding for energy research as part of their national <b>contributions.</b> Second, <b>pledges</b> should be binding, verifiable, and coordinated within an international energy-research plan. Third, expert scientific networks and participating governments should collaborate to design a coordinated global research and technology-demonstration strategy and oversee national research efforts. To this end an Intergovernmental Panel on Low-Emissions Technology Research might be established. This proposal offers some insurance against the risk that the political impasse in international negotiations cannot be overcome. The higher costs associated with low-emissions alternatives to fossil fuels currently creates significant economic and political resistance to their widespread adoption. To breach this impasse, a mechanism supporting accelerated energy research is needed that seeks to reduce future abatement costs, share experience and ‘learning-by-doing’ in first-of-a-kind demonstrations, and thus facilitate future widespread deployments. These actions will also assist in addressing inequalities in energy access. Barry W. Brook, Kingsley Edney, Rafaela Hillerbrand, Rasmus Karlsson & Jonathan Symon...|$|R

In his request, he expressed hope that the socks would:Cheer our soldiers, discourage desertions, hurry off able bodied furloughed men to the front and stimulate them to prefer honorable deaths {{in the face of the}} enemy, to dishonest lives prolonged by shrinking from duty.On December 24, 1863, a notice was placed in the Savannah Republican by one Carrie Bell Sinclair, president of the local Ladies' Knitting Society, stating:Having received from the Quartermaster General a large supply of knitting thread, members of the Society, or any one interested in the soldiers, can be supplied by calling on me any time during the week. We have been unable to supply all who have come forward and entered their names as members of the Society, having been entirely out of thread for the last two or three weeks. But we have now on hand enough for eighty or ninety pair of socks, and we hope those interested in the matter will come forward now and assist us in getting them done as early as possible. With the beginning of the New Year, let us renew our efforts in behalf of the suffering soldiers, and do all that we can for their comfort. Foster's sock campaign stimulated the supply of the much needed item, but may have also met with a certain amount of suspicion and backlash. Rumors of profiteering by the Quartermaster's office had circulated earlier, when Foster's purchases and impressments of textiles and shoes had driven up the price of goods. Foster claimed that new rumors, which he denied as a [...] "malicious falsehood!", had spread that he and his department were profiteering from the socks. It was alleged that contributed socks were being sold, rather than given freely to the troops. The charge would not have been without precedent. The historian Jeanie Attie notes that in 1861, an [...] "especially damaging rumor" [...] (later found to be true) had circulated in the North, alleging that the Union Army had purchased 5000 pairs of socks which had been donated, and intended for the troops, from a private relief agency, the United States Sanitary Commission. As the Sanitary Commission had done in the North, Foster undertook a propaganda campaign in Georgia newspapers to combat the alleged rumors and to encourage the continued contribution of socks. He offered $1,000.00 to any [...] "citizen or soldier who will come forward and prove that he ever bought a sock from this Department that was either knit by the ladies or purchased for issue to said troops." ...|$|R
