5|$|Medieval: Total War {{features}} a multiplayer game mode {{similar to that}} in Shogun: Total War, where players <b>can</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> real-time battles with up to seven other players. Players create and control armies from the factions available in the game, where players can use them to compete in online tournaments or casual battles. The campaign mode cannot be played multiplayer; this feature was later added to the Total War series in Empire: Total War – but only at the beta stage, before being later removed.|$|E
5|$|Multiplayer {{comes in}} two forms in Empire: Total War. As with {{previous}} Total War titles, players <b>can</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> real-time battles {{against each other}} either by composing their armies themselves, or re-enacting battles from history. The full campaign multiplayer mode was unveiled {{one month after the}} initial release, because the technology to create a multiplayer campaign game was not available in previous Total War games, and the time allowed The Creative Assembly to implement this for Empire: Total War. The campaign multiplayer mode was first tested in a two-player beta build which was released on 7 December 2009.|$|E
5|$|Players take up {{the roles}} of pilots who fly single-seat spacecraft, trading with merchants on space {{stations}} and planets, and engaging in combat against other vessels. Starting with a small spacecraft in a star system, the player's character explores the region, opening up new systems for further adventures. Each system provides opportunities to increase the pilot's wealth; aside from taking on jobs to ferry goods and hunting for bounties, the player character <b>can</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> trade. The player character's primary goal in the game is to accumulate money, so as to buy more advanced weaponry and equipment to upgrade his ship.|$|E

5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants <b>can</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E
5|$|Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist George Stobbart through the game's world and {{interacts with the}} environment by selecting from multiple commands, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character in selected portions of the game. The player controls George's movements and actions with a mouse (PC and PlayStation), or a gamepad (PlayStation). Player can collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George <b>can</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player uses a map to travel, and new locations are added to it as the story unfolds. By right clicking on an object, the player gets a description and clues. The player character's death is possible if the player makes a wrong decision.|$|E
5|$|Broken Sword: The Angel of Death uses both a {{point and}} click and direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's {{movements}} with a mouse or keyboard, and Nicole Collard {{is also a}} playable character in selected portions of the game. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George <b>can</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot.

5|$|During StarCraft: Ghosts gameplay, the player's {{character}} Nova {{must use}} stealth and darkness to reach objectives and remain undetected. Nova has a cloaking device {{that allows for}} temporary concealment, but certain hostile non-player characters can overcome this with special devices and abilities. Nova is also equipped with thermal imaging goggles and a special EMP device for disabling electronic devices and vehicles. In addition to the focus on stealth elements, StarCraft: Ghost includes a complex combat system. Blizzard planned to include a small arsenal of weaponry with assault and sniper rifles, grenades, shotguns, and flamethrowers. Nova <b>can</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> hand-to-hand combat and uses these skills to eliminate enemy threats quietly. If alerted, enemy characters will hunt for the player, set up traps, and fire blindly to nullify Nova's cloaking device.|$|E
5|$|Generating {{alternative}} behaviours {{that the}} person <b>can</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> instead of self-harm is one successful behavioural method that is employed to avoid self-harm. Techniques, aimed at keeping busy, may include journaling, taking a walk, participating in sports or exercise or being around friends when the person has the urge to harm themselves. The removal of objects used for self-harm from easy reach is also helpful for resisting self-harming urges. The provision of a card that allows the person to make emergency contact with counselling services should the urge to self-harm arise may also help prevent the act of self-harm. Alternative and safer methods of self-harm that do not lead to permanent damage, for example the snapping of a rubber band on the wrist, may also help calm the urge to self-harm. Using biofeedback may help raise self-awareness of certain pre-occupations or particular mental state or mood that precede bouts of self-harming behaviour, and help identify techniques to avoid those pre-occupations before they lead to self-harm. Any avoidance or coping strategy must be appropriate to the individual's motivation and reason for harming.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon is {{a departure}} from previous instalments in the series, using a direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's movements with a keyboard or gamepad, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character at certain times. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectable objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George <b>can</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player has action choices in the bottom right of the screen - there are four circles with anywhere from one to four actions available at any time; the player selects the desired action with the corresponding key. As in the first two Broken Sword games, in The Sleeping Dragon player character death is possible.|$|E

5|$|Xenosaga Episode II is a {{role-playing}} video game; {{the player}} controls {{a party of}} characters that expands {{during the course of}} the game, navigating them through a variety of environments tied to the progression of the story. Gameplay segments are separated by story sequences, which are told mainly through traditional full-motion cutscenes. Exploring environments, the party can collect a variety of items from destroying objects; some items can be used in gameplay to boost a character's statistics or restore health. Most areas can be navigated on foot, but some require the use of mechs. In addition to the main campaign, the party <b>can</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> side quests which vary from finding items to completing difficult battles, and unlock optional dungeon environments in which players can fight enemies and obtain rare items.|$|E
5|$|Abra uses various extrasensory powers, {{even when}} sleeping. With {{the ability to}} read minds, they can sense danger, teleporting when it does and can do so quickly enough to create visual doubles. Using self-hypnosis, Abra spends 18 hours a day sleeping, unable to utilize its telekinesis unless rested. This {{behavior}} ceases once it evolves into Kadabra, a strong psychic that emits alpha waves affected by its current mental state. These waves can trigger headaches in nearby people and can cause machines to malfunction. Once it evolves into Alakazam, it has mastered every type and form of psychic ability, and its brain continually grows. This causes its head to become too heavy for its neck, requiring telekinesis to hold it upright. Able to remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, Alakazam has an IQ that exceeds 5,000 and can outperform a supercomputer. Both Kadabra and Alakazam utilize spoons generated mentally to enhance their abilities, two for the latter, and can increase them further by closing their eyes. Upon Mega Evolving, Mega Alakazam's mental abilities become even more pronounced due to it manifesting an organ on its forehead that emits psychic power. It also manifests three additional spoons alongside the two it possessed as Alakazam. Kadabra and Alakazam <b>can</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> precognition, while all three Pokémon in the evolution line are capable of creating spaces where battle factors are affected.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character <b>can</b> <b>engage</b> <b>in</b> sword-based combat when the need arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E
