50|$|Although it is {{not shown}} on the {{original}} survey maps, {{there must have been}} a road that <b>crossed</b> <b>or</b> <b>branched</b> off of the Lusk Ferry Road in Franklin County. In 1814, John James Audubon attempted to cross Illinois by horse, on his way to Henderson, Kentucky. Audubon lost his horse crossing the Big Muddy near modern Plumfield, and nearly lost his life soon thereafter. This suggests an east/west road roughly following modern Illinois Route 149. This road would have led to Frank's Fort and Jordan's Fort, which were built around 1811, in response to Tecumseh's War.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Many {{algorithms}} {{have been}} proposed for tracking white matter fibres using the principle eigenvector of the diffusion tensor. These approaches can fail when fibres <b>cross</b> <b>or</b> <b>branch</b> at a subvoxel scale. We present a modification of existing tracking schemes that allows for subvoxel branching by using the RMS diffusion distance. The algorithm produces putative tracts {{as well as a}} scalar measure of the likelihood of existence for each tract. Theory Our contribution is a modification of the algorithm introduced by Parker et al [2], based on level set methods. The algorithm works with either DTI data or higher angular resolution diffusion coefficient measurements. From a seed point or region, a surface S is propagated outward along its normal with speed F. We desire S to propagate faster along tracts. Voxels reached quickly will be assigned high likelihood of connection to the seed. We propose a new speed function equal to the normalized RMS diffusion distance per unit time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Diffusion tensor imaging {{has made}} it {{possible}} to evaluate the organization and coherence of white matter fiber tracts. Hence, it has been used in many population studies, most notably, to find abnormalities in schizophrenia. To date, most population studies analyzing fiber tracts have used a single tensor as the local fiber model. While robust, this model is known to be a poor fit in regions of <b>crossing</b> <b>or</b> <b>branching</b> pathways. Nevertheless, the effect of using better alternative models on population studies has not been studied. The goal {{of this paper is to}} compare white matter abnormalities as revealed by two-tensor and singletensor models. To this end, we compare three different regions of the brain from two populations: schizophrenics and normal controls. Preliminary results demonstrate that regions with significant statistical difference indicated using one-tensor model do not necessarily match those using the two-tensor model and vice-versa. We demonstrate this effect using various tensor measures. ...|$|R
5000|$|Geometric glossitis, also termed {{herpetic}} geometric glossitis, is a {{term used}} by some {{to refer to a}} chronic lesion associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I infection, {{in which there is a}} deep fissure in the midline of the tongue, which gives off multiple branches. The lesion is usually very painful, and there may be erosions present in the depths of the fissures. Similar fissured lesions which are not associated with HSV, as may occur in fissured tongue, do not tend to be painful. The name comes from the geometric pattern of the fissures which are longitudinal, <b>crossed</b> <b>or</b> <b>branched.</b> [...] It is described as occurring in immunocompromized persons, e.g. who have leukemia. However, the association between herpes simplex and geometric glossitis is disputed by some due to a lack of gold standard techniques for diagnosis of intraoral herpetic lesions, and the high prevalence of asymptomatic viral shedding in immunocompromized individuals. Treatment is with systemic aciclovir.|$|R

30|$|In {{this study}} the waste {{polyethylene}} were degraded by thermal hydropyrolytic process. The degradation process mainly follows {{the mechanism of}} chain scissions which is generally caused by increase in temperature and sheer stress in twin-skew extruders and hence decreases the molecular weight. <b>Cross</b> linking <b>or</b> chain <b>branching</b> have opposite effect to chain scission and are caused mainly by low sheer stress and high residence time in a single skew extruders. A concurrence occurs between the molecular enlargement by chain branching and the decrease of molecular weight by chain scission. The thermal degradation of the polymers occurs by breaking C–C or C–H bonds. Degradation depends on the nature such as polar groups and structure, for example head-to-head or tail-to-tail weak linkages, double bonds <b>or</b> <b>branching</b> points of the polymeric chain, on the ingredients in the polymer resin and {{on the type of}} the external stress.|$|R
