40|$|Social {{movements}} are extra-institutional forces that stimulate institutional and social change. Research has emphasized political opportunities, consciousness and organizational readiness as critical <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>movements.</b> In this thesis, I {{argue that such}} a conceptualization couches agency under structure, and {{does not explain how}} activists may create movement potentiality when none of the aforementioned conditions exist. This omission is significant because many movements can be traced to a pre-movement period when one (or a few) activist group(s) operated in movement-inhibiting environments to create conditions that enable future movements. In particular, the current literature lacks insights regarding the following question: How does a social movement organization (SMO) create a pre-movement, and avoid elite repression in a movement-inhibiting context? I use extensive primary archival data, complemented by interviews, to address this question. Specifically, I study how an American non-governmental organization, the Ford Foundation (FF), through its grant-making activities in China from 1975 to 2008, mobilized a diverse range of actors to seed the human rights movement in an authoritarian environment. I identify two strategic processes by FF: 1) a brokering process, in which FF transferred human rights-related meanings and knowledge from Western contexts to China, and 2) a scaffolding process, in which FF developed concept-espousing Chinese actors and linked them into networks. The first process generated movement consciousness, while the second process created movement-relevant actors and networks. Importantly, I find that FF was able to enact these two pre-movement processes without elite repression through “robust action” — namely, by developing double-sided actors who addressed elites’ needs of resolving institutional contradictions during China’s economic reform, but who also possessed human rights consciousness. This thesis contributes to social movement research by identifying SMO strategic processes in the pre-movement period and explaining how SMOs can respond to movement-inhibiting contexts with robust action...|$|E

The necessary <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>movement</b> detection is that one single pixel changes its status.

In this context, the relationship between pedology and hydrology has been debated and analyzed in recent years, contributing to the creation of a multidisciplinary science call hydropedology. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the hydropedological properties of a mountainous Clayey Humic Dystrudept in the Mantiqueira Range region, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, comparing two land-uses, native forest and pasture. The hydraulic conductivity results demonstrated that native forest (MFO) has a strong influence on this parameter, offering <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>movement</b> of water in the soil that are more adequate in this profile than in pasture. These results were supported by pore size distribution analyses which showed that soil from native forest has a greater amount of macropores than soil from pasture as well as greater connectivity between the macropores. In general, the MFO site had greater S index values than the micro-catchment taken from pasture, offering favorable physical <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> the formation of preferential flowpaths in the soil profile and, therefore, better <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> groundwater recharge. Soil erosion and water quality results confirmed the importance of native forest areas in the interaction between interception of the direct impact of intense precipitation on the soil surface, and hydropedological attributes, such as saturated hydraulic conductivity and porosity...|$|R

In {{the first part of}} this paper, the results of some basic experiments on the critical trac-tive force of graded sand gravels, especially the mechanism of sediment transport nearthe critical <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>movement</b> and the sorting effect of flow, are described. It isconcluded from the experiments that the practical definition for the criterion for move-ment of sand gravels proposed by the author in the previous paper can also be appliedto the critical tractive force of graded sand gravels, and the sorting effect of flow nearthe critical condition is expressed by a function of size frequency distributions of gradedsand gravels. In the second part, a theory for the critical tractive force of graded sand gravels isdeveloped, based on the author's procedure to solve the criterion <b>for</b> <b>movement</b> of sandgravels and the existence of wakes behind sand gravels. It is clarified from the com-parison of the theoretical curve with the results of experiments performed by the authorand some other authorities that the critical tractive force of graded sand gravels expressedin the dimensionless form is a function of the standard deviation of graded sand gravels,and the theoretical curve is in good agreement with the experimental results within therange of the standard deviation less than about two.

The existence of soft rock layers in the slope created favourable <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> the development of the fractures. During the failure propagation, the hill at the eastern flank acts as a resistant wall that crushed the sliding rock into fragmented particles and direct them into a narrow channel.

Our {{approach}} employs relative angular position measurements to estimate the three-axis magnetometer measurement bias, significantly improving magnetometer-based attitude estimation.

We report two methods implementing this approach based on batch linear least squares and a real-time discrete Kalman filter. Compared with previously reported methods our approach is time independent and less restrictive with data sampling. In addition, our two methods (i) are empirically shown to impose less restrictive <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>movements</b> of the instrument required for calibration, (ii) do not require knowledge of the direction of the field (e. g., the local magnetic field) or the attitude of the instrument, and (iii) also ensure convergence for the estimated parameters.
