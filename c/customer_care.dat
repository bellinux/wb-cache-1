30|$|The {{empirical}} evidence of whether all <b>customers</b> <b>care</b> about sustainability issues and express their concerns through purchasing behavior and thus price sensitivity is debatable. Even those customers, {{who say they}} care about sustainability, {{do not necessarily reflect}} their attitude in their purchasing habit (Bonini and Oppenheim 2008; Bellows et al. 2008; Fisher 1993; Pickett-Baker and Ozaki 2008). As a consequence, sustainable practices may directly and negatively affect profitability, and organizations may refrain from diving into adopting sustainable practices.|$|R

25|$|A {{customer}} satisfaction survey {{was carried out in}} 2009–2010 for all towns served by NWSC. It covered questions such as satisfaction with water reliability, water pressure, water quality, timely and accurate water bills, responsiveness in resolving complaints, responsiveness in effecting new connections, <b>customer</b> <b>care,</b> and the convenience of the bill payment process. Out of 5,319 customers contacted in a stratisfied sample, 2,731 responded. <b>Customer</b> <b>care</b> received the highest rating, while water quality and pressure received lower, but overall good, ratings. A {{customer satisfaction}} index was calculated across all questions, showing that 85 percent of customers were satisfied, up from 83 percent during the last survey. Satisfaction was highest in Hoima, Iganda, and Masindi at 95 percent and lowest in the central Ugandan town of Mubende, where no <b>customer</b> <b>care</b> officer or desk existed, at 62 percent. In Kampala, satisfaction was 83 percent. Customers appreciated the ambiance in local offices, that phone calls are made to remind customers of payment, that customers can settle their arrears through payment plans in exceptional cases, and that water cuts are announced through the radio. Customers complained about low water pressure, muddy water during the wet season, supply interruptions during the dry season, low water pressure, slow implementation of new connections, erratic bills, disconnection despite having paid their water bills, and the rudeness of field staff.|$|E

40|$|Two major {{paradigms}} {{prevail in}} trade theory: perfect competition and monopolistic competition. In the former case, only prices are important whereas product characteristics {{are important in}} the latter case. In both instances, pure-strategy equilibria exist. This paper considers the hybrid situation where some <b>customers</b> <b>care</b> only about the price while others have a brand preference or care about product characteristics. It is shown that an equilibrium in pure strategies does not exist but that a mixed-strategy equilibrium does exist. This in turn implies endogenous uncertainty in the pattern, terms, and the gains from trade. ...|$|R
40|$|Crafting and {{stimulating}} service innovation {{is considered a}} main research priority and remains a challenge for service providers. One suggested component of stimulating service innovation is customer creativity. Customers who adapt, modify and transform services or products to better suit themselves are increasingly being recognized {{as a source of}} competitive value and innovation. It has been proposed that understanding and supporting the customer’s value creating practices is the key to creating and sustaining value over time in health care. Health services directly address a customer’s well-being and {{have a significant impact on}} his or her quality of life. In these types of services, the service outcome is highly dependent on the activities of the individual <b>customer.</b> Health <b>care</b> services often require customers to participate extensively, over long periods of time, with limited support and control. Health services also stretch far beyond the particular service setting into the customer’s daily life. While research, policy, and legislation have all emphasized the active role of health <b>care</b> <b>customers,</b> such customers have traditionally had few opportunities to design their health care services. Nevertheless, health <b>care</b> <b>customers</b> solve health-related problems and engage in self-care and medical decision-making on a day-to-day basis, although this creativity is often unknown to the service provider. To understand how health <b>care</b> <b>customers</b> can enable service innovation, this thesis seeks to conceptualize and investigate the concept of customer creativity in health care. The thesis focuses on customer creativity, not only as an outcome, but also as a dynamic and contextualized process that can be enhanced. The thesis combines insights from health care research with service and innovation research to provide build a framework for health <b>care</b> <b>customer</b> creativity. Building on five papers, the research develops an understanding for health <b>care</b> <b>customer</b> creativity. The individual papers are based on systematic literature reviews as well as empirical data in the form of customers’ ideas for service innovation collected through diaries. The results of the thesis suggest that despite the negative nature of the service, health <b>care</b> <b>customers</b> are creative. Given the opportunity, health <b>care</b> <b>customers</b> can provide creative ideas and solutions on a multitude of aspects, both within and outside the health care setting. This provides the potential to view the health care experience through the customers’ eyes and take part in their creativity in spheres where the service providers have not traditionally had any access. This thesis contributes to the literature by providing a framework for health <b>care</b> <b>customer</b> creativity that recognizes the concept as a complex interplay of factors operating at the individual, contextual, and situational levels. The proposed framework specifies the health care specific factors upon which customer creativity depends, with the intention of positing potential research directions and developing an enriched theory of health <b>care</b> <b>customer</b> creativity...|$|R

Call center services include customer relations, ranging from travel services, technical support, education, <b>customer</b> <b>care,</b> financial services, online business to customer support, and online business-to-business support. Business process outsourcing (BPO) is {{regarded as one of the}} fastest growing industries in the world. The Philippines is also considered as a location of choice due to its many outsourcing benefits such as less expensive operational and labor costs, the high proficiency in spoken English of a significant number of its people, and a highly educated labor pool. In 2011, the business process outsourcing industry in the Philippines generated 700 thousand jobs and some US$11 billion in revenue, 24 percent higher than 2010. By 2016, the industry is projected to reach US$27.4 billion in revenue with employment generation to almost double at 1.3 million workers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether investors {{care more}} about trading their exact quantity demands at some times than at others. Using a new data set of foreign-exchange transactions, I find that customers trade more precise quantities at quarter-end, as evidenced by less trade-size clustering.

I also find that the price impact of order flow is greater when <b>customers</b> <b>care</b> more about trading precise quantities.

40|$|With the {{development}} of e-commerce, many products are now being sold worldwide, and manufacturers are eager to obtain {{a better understanding of}} customer behavior in various regions. To achieve this goal, most previous efforts have focused mainly on questionnaires, which are time-consuming and costly. The tremendous volume of product reviews on e-commerce websites has seen a new trend emerge, whereby manufacturers attempt to understand user preferences by analyzing online reviews. Following this trend, this paper addresses the problem of studying customer behavior by exploiting recently developed opinion mining techniques. This work is novel for three reasons. First, questionnaire-based investigation is automatically enabled by employing algorithms for template-based question generation and opinion mining-based answer extraction. Using this system, manufacturers are able to obtain reports of customer behavior featuring a much larger sample size, more direct information, a higher degree of automation, and a lower cost. Second, international customer behavior study is made easier by integrating tools for multilingual opinion mining. Third, {{this is the first time}} an automatic questionnaire investigation has been conducted to compare customer behavior in China and America, where product reviews are written and read in Chinese and English, respectively. Our study on digital cameras, smartphones, and tablet computers yields three findings. First, Chinese customers follow the Doctrine of the Mean, and often use euphemistic expressions, while American customers express their opinions more directly. Second, Chinese <b>customers</b> <b>care</b> more about general feelings, while American customers pay more attention to product details. Third, Chinese customers focus on external features, while American <b>customers</b> <b>care</b> more about the internal features of products...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of doing business becomes an increasingly relevant aspect for organizations, {{not only because of}} legal requirements but also because more <b>customers</b> <b>care</b> about environmental influences. Most organizations, however, do not have comprehensive knowledge on how to restructure their business processes accordingly. In previous work we proposed green business process patterns that address the {{environmental impact}} explicitly as one possible solution. Beyond those patterns, we now provide environmentally relevant patterns derived from existing patterns of different domains. In this work, we present a set of such patterns related to automated business processes. The identified patterns support stakeholders when analyzing their business processes with respect to the environmental impact and, therefore, supporting green business process reengineering.

This thesis is to describe the effects of time based strategy in distribution logistics and how IKEA can gain competitive advantages by the utilization of time based strategy.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{competitive}} impact of vertical integration between a platform and a manufacturer when platforms provide operating systems for devices sold by manufacturers to <b>customers,</b> and, <b>customers</b> <b>care</b> about the applications {{developed for the}} operating systems. Two-sided network effects between customers and developers create strategic substitutability between manufacturers' prices. When it brings efficiency gains, vertical integration increases consumer surplus, is not profitable when network effects are strong, and, benefits the non-integrated manufacturer. When developers bear a cost to make their applications available on a platform, manufacturers boost the participation of developers by affiliating with the same platform. This creates some market power for the integrated firm and vertical integration then harms consumers, is always profitable, and, leads to foreclosure. Introducing developer fees highlights that not only the level, but also the structure of indirect network effects matter for the competitive analysis...|$|R

40|$|Easy {{availability}} of stations serving alternative fuels {{is an obvious}} concern for customers considering to buy a “green” car. Yet, the supply of fuel is seldom considered when analyzing the problem of fostering the adoption of environmentally friendly vehicles.

I use this framework to compare the effectiveness of a subsidy to consumers who buy cars running on alternative fuels to that of a subsidy to gas stations installing alternative fuel pumps. Counterfactual simulations suggest that subsidizing fuel retailers to offer alternative fuels is an effective policy to indirectly increase low emission car sales...|$|R
