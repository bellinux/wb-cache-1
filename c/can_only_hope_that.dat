5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from getting angry, or mad, or frustrated. I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E

Forty years later, {{and it was time to}} pay back the Poms. When Keith Fletcher deflected a ball on to his cap and crumpled in a heap as it dropped just short of cover point, Ian Chappell probably thought his grandafther would approve if he had been alive to witness the carnage.

Kitson described the work as timely and important {{within the context of a}} need for the public to act before a point of no return: [...] "This is a crucial book to read before runaway climate change is truly beyond our control". Her review concluded: [...] "One <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> this book will be read by climate deniers so we can start the challenging journey to an ecologically sustainable future".|$|E

In a posthumous review of his three-volume Dizionario etimologico sardo, Ernst Pulgram wrote: It <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> ... there will arise ... men like Wagner: original thinkers, deep specialists, and great synthesizers of knowledge {{all at the same}} time.|$|R
50|$|Mangrove loss {{has been}} a {{worldwide}} trend for the last 50 years due primarily to anthropogenic activities that compete for land area. Expansions in mangrove area do occur, but have a limited ability to offset the extensive losses. Recently the rate of loss has been declining due to a greater awareness of mangrove values, with legislation and conservation projects becoming more commonplace. It <b>can</b> <b>only</b> be <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> this declining rate of loss continues, allowing future generations to appreciate the many benefits of mangroves.|$|R
500|$|Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail criticised Home and Away for {{the amount}} of car {{accidents}} it features. When Miles nearly crashed his car, she asked if anyone in Summer Bay is capable of [...] "sitting atop four wheels" [...] without nearly getting killed. Stephen was not a fan of Miles' long hair. When he returned in 2011, she said [...] "we <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> he’s seen a hairdresser since his departure." [...] When he left the series, Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap said that Home and Away [...] "won't be the same without Miles' shaggy barnet". Laura Morgan of All About Soap said that she and her colleagues were [...] "in mourning" [...] over Miles' exit. She added that they [...] "sorely missed" [...] him.|$|E
500|$|In an {{obituary}} in the New York Times, Kennan {{was described}} as [...] "the American diplomat who did {{more than any other}} envoy of his generation to shape United States policy during the cold war" [...] to whom [...] "the White House and the Pentagon turned when they sought to understand the Soviet Union after World WarII". Of Kennan, historian Wilson D. Miscamble remarked that [...] "ne <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> present and future makers of foreign policy might share something of his integrity and intelligence". Foreign Policy described Kennan as [...] "the most influential diplomat of the 20th century". Henry Kissinger said that Kennan [...] "came as close to authoring the diplomatic doctrine of his era as any diplomat in our history", while Colin Powell called Kennan [...] "our best tutor" [...] in dealing with the foreign policy issues of the 21st century.|$|E
500|$|For {{his third}} opera, Bush chose a {{contemporary}} theme – {{the struggle against}} colonial rule. He intended to collect appropriate musical material from [...] British Guiana, but an attempt to visit the colony in 1957 was thwarted when its government refused him entry. The ban was rescinded the following year, and in 1959 Bush was able to gather and record {{a great deal of}} authentic [...] music from the local African and Indian populations. The eventual result was The Sugar Reapers, [...] premiered at Leipzig on 11 December 1966. The Times correspondent, praising the performance, wrote: [...] "One <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> London will soon see a production of its own". [...] With Nancy, Bush wrote two more operettas for children: The Spell Unbound (1953) and The Ferryman's [...] Daughter (1961). His final opera, written in 1965–67, was Joe Hill, based on the [...] life story of Joe Hill, [...] an American union activist and songwriter who was [...] controversially convicted of murder and executed in 1915. The opera, to a libretto by Barrie Stavis, was premiered [...] at the German State Opera, Berlin, on 29 September 1970, and in 1979 was broadcast by the BBC.|$|E

500|$|The {{environment}} in Lody's boarding-house was becoming increasingly hostile; his hosts were growing suspicious of him. Their doubts grew as the ongoing espionage scare progressed. He had {{stayed there for}} more than three weeks and his evasive answers when questioned about when he expected to leave did not satisfy them. When they said that his accent appeared to be [...] "more German than American", he knew it was time to go. He wrote in his letter of 27 September that [...] "the fear of espionage is very great and every day I see some Germans going to Redford Barracks under the escort of a soldier... It is advisable for me to vanish for a few days, and to change my place of abode. I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> my telegraphic and letter information have duly arrived." [...] He told his controllers that he would go to Ireland, disembarking at Dublin as it was the only Irish port not closed to foreigners. Despite his hopes, his letter was intercepted by the British; this time it was retained as the information therein was of genuine military value.|$|E
500|$|Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode a B– rating. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a {{negative}} review {{and called it}} [...] "easily {{the worst of the}} season". He awarded it a 4 out of 10 and concluded that, [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> none of the remaining episodes are Shiban-related, and pray that he can do a much better job when he writes for [...] next season." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five, and called the entry [...] "solid and efficient". The two complimented Shiban's directorial efforts, noting that [...] "as a director [...] makes 'Underneath' shine", but were critical of some of the [...] "trademark X-File moments", citing [...] "the surprise appearance of a face in the bathroom mirror" [...] and [...] "the climactic fight in a sewer" [...] as examples. Shearman and Pearson, however, wrote positively of Shiban's realistic depiction of Doggett. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, wrote that the episode felt [...] "very familiar" [...] but was impressed with the production design on the sewer set.|$|E
500|$|The Queen {{reportedly}} felt a [...] "profound {{sense of}} disappointment" [...] in Blair for breaking with protocol by revealing {{in his memoirs}} sensitive details of private conversations he had with her during his time as Prime Minister. A spokesman for Buckingham Palace told a newspaper, [...] "No prime minister before has ever done this and we <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> {{it will never happen}} again." [...] The Sunday Express claimed, quoting [...] "renowned Royal biographer Hugo Vickers" [...] and other [...] "Royal insiders", that because of the book's contents, ElizabethII would withhold granting Blair the Order of the Thistle, an honour which is bestowed at the sovereign's personal prerogative and normally given almost automatically to leaders of Scottish descent after leaving office. Gordon Brown was said to be [...] "seething" [...] and [...] "dismayed" [...] over the criticism he received from Blair in the book, but had told aides not to criticise it. Ed Balls, a Brown ally who served in his government as Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families said, [...] "It would have been much better if the memoirs had been a celebration of success rather than recriminations. In that sense I thought it was all a bit sad. It was so one-sided. I didn't think it was comradely." ...|$|E

Soon afterwards, the album was produced, compiled and edited by Harley and Matt Butler at The Stone House in Herefordshire. It was mastered by Clive at Audio Edit Productions. Originally, the album's pre-orders were due to be dispatched {{before the end of}} the year. However, the album's release was delayed by a few weeks due to unforeseen printing issues over the CD's sleeve. Harley and his team had rejected the first two test prints from the printing company, and settled on the third. Commenting on its impending release in a January 2003 diary entry, Harley said: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> then <b>that</b> those who have bought it will be satisfied.

40|$|Why {{has there}} been such {{long-term}} controversy (LTC) over the mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation (LTP) ? The inability to resolve this debate may have many sources, including intrinsically empirical as well as sociological factors. Certainly, the regulatory mechanisms underlying modification of transmission in the brain {{are likely to be}} complex, and the tools we posses are relatively coarse. In this light, the fact that scientists generally are clever enough to think of mechanistic scenarios that cannot be disproved by existing empirical tools complicates the search. Furthermore, the imbalanced impact of positive results over negative results, or the natural bias of scientists to champion their own point of view, can prolong the discourse. Whatever the source, the field of LTP has been mired with LTC to the point that most consider it a long-term tar pit (LTTP). How does one escape eternal fossilization?

2500|$|Arar {{settlement}} in Canada does not close the book. It only opens {{a new chapter}} of a book that {{is about more than}} Maher Arar — it is about the erosion of civil and human rights in Canada {{as a result of the}} [...] "War on Terror."

It’s a film that could have gone so wrong {{in so many ways}} so easily, but the results show something that is genuine and inspired. It takes the smartest possible routes with the story it wants to tell and delivers in basically every way it needed to. Ryan Coogler cements himself {{as one of the best}} rising filmmakers working today, as he crafts an emotional, funny, compelling and uplifting film that is full of strong performances." [...] Andrew Barker of Variety stated that the film lives up to the expectation of its predecessors, while forging its own unique path. He also appreciated the performances of Stallone and Jordan, saying that Stallone deserves credit for taking a chance on young director Coogler, and that his trust has paid off. He concluded that the director [...] "offered a smart, kinetic, exhilaratingly well-crafted piece of mainstream filmmaking". IGN reviewer John Lasser gave the film an 8.5 out of 10, saying, [...] "Creed is a mirror of Rocky's story and we have all been watching that unfold on the big screen for decades. Coogler's film does nothing to break the mold. Rather, it shows that the mold exists for a reason. Jordan delivers a knockout performance, and Stallone does as well.
