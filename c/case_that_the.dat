5|$|After BC {{became a}} Canadian {{province}} in 1871, Crease devoted {{the next few}} years to fighting for judicial independence—specifically the right of judges to live outside their districts. In 1881 the BC Supreme Court, including Crease, ruled in the Thrasher <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> province's attempts to regulate judges were unconstitutional. This decision was overturned two years later by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Aurobindo was {{influenced}} by studies on rebellion and revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy. In his public activities he favoured non-co-operation and passive resistance; in private he took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation for open revolt, in <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> passive revolt failed.|$|E
5|$|Lastly, {{he played}} {{at least some}} part in the {{establishment}} of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, passing the cipher manuscripts from which it was founded to his friend William Wynn Westcott shortly before his death.

30|$|The {{numerical}} <b>case</b> {{study shows}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> presented new algorithm and improved Procrustes algorithm are both stable and reliable for <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> control points are distributed in 3 D, and 2 D including approximate 2 D space, and can recover at most two angles {{as well as}} all translation and scale parameters for <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> control points are distributed in 1 D space. The classic Procrustes algorithm also can compute all translation and scale parameters for all <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> control points are distributed in 3 D, 2 D, and 1 D spaces; however, it may yield a reflection rather than a rotation in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> common points are distributed in 2 D space. The numerical case study also shows the presented algorithm in this paper, and improved Procrustes algorithm is both stable and reliable when the rotation angles are big. And the presented algorithm in this paper is comparable with the classic Procrustes algorithm when the point-wise weight matrix is involved.|$|R

5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem while they were still working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E

Brayton of ScienceBlogs pointed out that Beck and his lawyers never replied to Randazza's request for all parties to stipulate to the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment in the case. Brayton observed that this was irrelevant as Beck's case was weak even when examined under the standards of the UN agency. Of Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain over to Beck after {{the conclusion}} of the case he commented that this was a wise strategic move. Monica Hesse of The Washington Post remarked upon {{the conclusion of}} the <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> division between what is considered libel and satire was murky, and asked whether this determination was more difficult to make on the Internet where speech can be amplified by others.|$|E
5|$|It {{appeared}} {{as though the}} government might seize Lincoln for being insolvent. The investigation was, however, taking a long time. Keating was asking that Lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, {{so that it could}} limit its high risk investments and get into the safe (at the time) home mortgage business, thus allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government investigation was taking a long time. Keating now wanted the five senators to intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a blink before the US, a conditioned response or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails to show any response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a strong <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.|$|E

5|$|The Claimant was now bankrupt. In 1870 his {{new legal}} {{advisers}} launched a novel fundraising scheme: Tichborne Bonds, {{an issue of}} 1,000 debentures of £100 face value, the holders {{of which would be}} repaid with interest when the Claimant obtained his inheritance. About £40,000 was raised, though the bonds quickly traded at a considerable discount and were soon being exchanged for derisory sums. The scheme allowed the Claimant to continue to meet his living and legal expenses for a while. After a delay while the Franco-Prussian War and its aftermath prevented key witnesses from leaving Paris, the civil <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Claimant hoped would confirm his identity finally came to court in May 1871.|$|E
5|$|The shapeshifter was {{an enigmatic}} and mysterious {{character}} in the StarCraft Universe.

In each <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shapeshifter has appeared in a meaningful role the creature has assumed the form of a Terran Male. The Shapeshifter's allegiance was to the fallen Xel'Naga Amon, and accordingly its actions were to further Amon's own goals.|$|E
5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, {{it is only a matter}} of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E

5|$|Three judges testified as {{character}} witnesses: John Peter Barnes (N.D. Ill.) {{on behalf of}} Glasser, Kretske, and Roth; Charles Edgar Woodward (N.D. Ill.) on behalf of Glasser and Kretske; and state judge John F. Haas on behalf of Kretske. Kaplan and Horton both took the stand, denying that they ever paid money to Glasser or Kretske. Two defense attorneys, Henry Balaban and Edward J. Hess (who was representing Kaplan at the trial), who had also defended clients in cases the government's case-in-chief had alleged to be fixed, denying paying bribes to Glasser or Kretske (although the government had not accused them of this). Glasser's testimony took three hours, as he was cross-examined individually about every single <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government had alleged to have been fixed.|$|E
5|$|In 1707 a deed {{was found}} among the ancient files of York County, Maine, near where Wheelwright had brought his flock to settle in Wells. The deed, dated 17 May 1629, showed Wheelwright as being one of several {{recipients}} of land from the Indian sagamores of southern New Hampshire, and a signer of the document. The deed thus implied that Wheelwright was present in New England in 1629, {{even though he was}} known to be the vicar of Bilsby in Lincolnshire at the time. While many historians declared the deed to be a forgery, Charles H. Bell, in his biography of Wheelwright in 1876, presented the <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deed could be legitimate. It was known that as the vicar of Bilsby, Wheelwright was required to send a transcript of the parish registers to a central repository once a year, and this was done in March. However, of the several transcripts found with Wheelwright's signature attached, the one for March 1629 could not be found, leaving the door wide open to the possibility that Wheelwright had come to New England during this time frame and then returned to England. Sometime after Bell published his book on Wheelwright, the missing transcript was found, proving almost conclusively that Wheelwright had never left England during his ministry at Bilsby, and demonstrating with certainty that the deed of 1629 was a forgery. Sometime before his death, Governor Bell acknowledged the sequence of events and that the deed was an ingenious fabrication, and stated this in an undated letter to the New England Historical and Genealogical Society.|$|E
5|$|Recognising {{that the}} {{situation}} was safer for him, Lenin returned to Petrograd via Vyborg. There, Lenin attended {{a meeting of the}} Bolshevik Central Committee on 10 October, where he again argued his <b>case</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party should lead an armed insurrection of their supporters to topple the Provisional Government. This time, he was successful in his argument, and the motion was ratified with ten votes against two. Those critical of the plan, Zinoviev and Kamenev, expressed the view that Russian workers would not support a violent coup against the existing regime {{and that there was no}} clear evidence for Lenin's assertion that all of Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. The party began plans to organise the offensive, holding a final meeting at the Smolny Institute on 24 October. This was the base of the Military Revolutionary Committee (MRC), an armed militia that had been established by the Petrograd Soviet with the Provisional Government's support during the Kornilov Affair; the MRC consisted largely of those loyal to the Bolsheviks.|$|E

30|$|Speaker {{recognition}} is often classified into closed-set recognition and open-set recognition.
