5|$|The {{widespread}} <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{was recognized}} as a problem by Dr. Eli Todd in 1812. In a conversation with Edward Hooker on March 30, 1812, he stated {{that there was no}} single solution to alcoholism. “He advised a 3-pronged attack that was as follows: there should be an association of respectable men who would make it unfashionable to take ardent spirits; work houses of ‘idle, drinking persons’ after their third conviction for drunkenness; and heavy taxes on imported and domestic liquor”.|$|E
5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, some Protestant Christians {{moved from a}} {{position}} of allowing moderate use of alcohol (sometimes called moderationism) to either deciding that not imbibing was wisest in the present circumstances (abstentionism) or prohibiting all ordinary <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> because it was believed to be a sin (prohibitionism). Many Protestant churches, particularly Methodists and Evangelical groups, advocated abstentionism and were early leaders in the temperance movement of the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, all three positions exist in Christianity, but the historic position remains the most common worldwide, due to the adherence by the largest bodies of Christians, namely Anglicanism, Roman Catholicism, and Eastern Orthodoxy.|$|E

5|$|Temperance {{became a}} part of the evangelical Protestant {{initiative}} during Indiana's pioneer era and early statehood. Many Hoosiers freely indulged in drinking locally distilled whiskey on a daily basis, with binges on election days and holidays, and during community celebrations Reformers announced that the devil was at work and must be repudiated. A state temperance society formed in 1829 and local temperance societies soon organized in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and Logansport. By the 1830s pietistic (evangelical) Protestants and community leaders had joined forces to curb <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> In 1847 the Indiana General Assembly passed a local option bill that allowed a vote on whether to prohibit alcohol sales in a township.|$|E
5|$|Under federal law, the {{drinking}} age for the Armed Forces {{is the same}} as the state or nation where the military base is located, or {{the drinking}} age of a state or nation within 50 miles of the base. Effectively, that restricts the purchase of alcohol at New Jersey military bases to those over 21. Irrespective of state laws on underage consumption, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard prohibit the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> by underage personnel when stationed in the United States. Marines under 21 are permitted to drink alcohol at U.S. bases on special occasions.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the state, federal {{agencies}} which allow alcohol sales {{do not have}} a system of liquor licenses or alcoholic beverage control boards, but instead simply award contracts to business per federal procurement laws. New Jersey does not consider municipal ordinances to be criminal offenses, and so open container laws cannot be enforced in federal enclaves under the Assimilative Crimes Act. Public <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> is allowed on federal lands, except when in an automobile, or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area. For example, it is legal to consume alcoholic beverages on the beach at Sandy Hook.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the police}} focused their law {{enforcement}} efforts {{on dealing with}} the illegal <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> which was considered to promote violent behaviour among the First Nations. By the 1880s, however, the police also began to tackle horse theft. Horse stealing was common among the First Nations on the prairies: it formed part of intertribal competition and warfare, and the stolen horses enabled their hunting expeditions. In part the police crackdown was driven by the Department for Indian Affairs, who believed {{that the practice of}} horse theft was slowing the assimilation of the First Nations into broader Canadian society. The authorities were also concerned that if the First Nations were allowed to steal horses from across the border in the United States, it could provoke a military intervention into Canada.|$|E
5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, and <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> on a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey's {{state parks}} and forests {{prohibit}} the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages except at pre-approved events. There is no state law against public <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> in other locations, but most municipalities have open container laws prohibiting or restricting public consumption. The fine for alcohol possession {{in a state}} park is $71, whereas municipal fines for public consumption violations can {{be as high as}} $2000, although they are generally much lower. Per the Alcoholism Treatment and Rehabilitation Act (ATRA), public intoxication without accompanying disorderly behavior is not a criminal offense, and municipalities are prohibited from making ordinances against public intoxication. New Jersey law allows a police officer to take people found to be intoxicated in public to their residence or to a medical facility.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} for English fans attending the final was the acquisition of visas for entry into Russia. However, {{after a period of}} negotiations between representatives of Russia, the United Kingdom, UEFA and the two clubs, it was agreed that fans with tickets for the match would not require a visa, provided they were also able to produce a passport with at least six months before expiry and a completed immigration card on entry into Russia. The visa-free period was initially supposed to run for 72 hours between 19 May and 23 May, but this was later extended to an eight-day period lasting from 17 May to 25 May. Because of the difficulty and expense of acquiring a ticket and visa, fans who had not already got tickets were advised against travelling to Moscow by UEFA's William Gaillard, who also warned fans about Russia's strict laws regarding the <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} into the fire was led by the Division of Forestry's chief investigator, Sam Butcher. The investigation lasted four months, and once a suspect had been identified, the case {{was turned over to}} the Webster County prosecuting attorney's office. Butcher credited Art Yagel, a Division of Forestry investigator, for bringing the investigation to its conclusion. In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from Bergoo was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire to the tree, while a second juvenile was also charged with a misdemeanor for providing false information to investigators. The suspect was also charged with misdemeanor counts of providing false information to conservation officers, possession of marijuana, and underage <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The second juvenile was not involved in the setting of the fire.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt did not fare as well {{in state}} politics. He ardently {{supported}} Jacksonian principles, and wielded his veto against bills critical of President Jackson's land policy. He supported Jackson's desire to dissolve the Second Bank of the United States. Instead, he favored opening a number of state banks, but faced with a Whig majority in the legislature, he succeeded only in chartering the Louisville Bank of Kentucky. He also favored completion of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad, and supported a $300,000 loan from the state Board of Internal Improvements for that purpose. In 1833, a loan for half the amount was approved, and the railroad was not completed until 1851. Breathitt was {{also part of the}} temperance movement in Kentucky. In an 1832 address, he blamed <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> for the high murder rate in the state. When the Kentucky Legislative Temperance Society was formed at a meeting in the state house on January 13, 1834, Breathitt was chosen as its president and Lieutenant Governor Morehead served as one of five vice-presidents.|$|E

40|$|The <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> excess <b>alcohol</b> in {{patients}} with liver iron storage diseases, in particular the iron-overload disease hereditary haemochromatosis (HH), has important clinical consequences. HH, a common genetic disorder amongst people of European descent, results in a slow, progressive accumulation of excess hepatic iron. If left untreated, the condition may lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> excess <b>alcohol</b> remains an important cause of hepatic cirrhosis and alcohol consumption itself may lead to altered iron homeostasis. Both alcohol and iron independently {{have been shown to}} result in increased oxidative stress causing lipid peroxidation and tissue damage. Therefore, the added effects of both toxins may exacerbate the pathogenesis of disease and impose an increased risk of cirrhosis. This review discusses the concomitant effects <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> and iron on the pathogenesis of liver disease. We also discuss the implications <b>of</b> co-existent <b>alcohol</b> and iron in end-stage liver disease...|$|R
