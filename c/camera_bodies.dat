2500|$|The name is {{sometimes}} spelled Zenith in English, {{such as the}} manuals published by the UK Zenit-importer TOE. However, TOE's imported <b>camera</b> <b>bodies</b> as from 1963 retained the [...] "Zenit" [...] badges. The early Zorki-based models before that time were labelled [...] "Zenith" [...] in a handwritten style of script.|$|E

5000|$|MD X-600 - 1983-1998: X-600 mount {{extension}} {{reporting the}} maximum aperture {{of the lens}} to the <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> which then engaged different auto focus confirmation sensors in the <b>camera</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R
50|$|In contrast, swivel LCDs (also {{known as}} {{articulating}} screen) are displays that freely rotate while {{attached to a}} <b>camera</b> <b>body.</b> Usually, the <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> is {{much larger than the}} swivelling display. Swivel LCD devices can be considered as swivel lens devices because the <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> can swivel around the small display; albeit, aiming the camera is more difficult. Most camcorders have a swivel LCD.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon F-mount lens {{systems and}} the Pentax K-mount systems are the only 35 mm SLR camera systems (apart from the Leica M-mount {{rangefinder}} system) that allow a photographer to use a mechanical SLR <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> a fully automatic SLR <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> and a DSLR <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> all utilizing the same lenses. The only aspects of these manufacturers' lenses that have changed are the addition of electronic contacts, autofocus abilities and, in some cases, {{the elimination of the}} external aperture ring for electronic control (i.e., Nikon's 'G-type' auto-Nikkors, which cannot be used on a mechanical SLR <b>camera</b> <b>body).</b>|$|R

50|$|Hartblei makes tilt-and-shift lenses to fit various manufacturers’ <b>camera</b> <b>bodies.</b> It {{currently}} offers four Super-Rotator Tilt/Shift lenses for 35 mm bodies: the TS-PC Hartblei 35 mm 2.8, the TS-PC Hartblei 65 mm 3.5, the TS-PC Hartblei 80 mm 2.8, and the TS-PC Hartblei 120 mm 2.8. It {{also offers}} the TS-PC Hartblei 45 mm 3.5 to fit several medium-format <b>camera</b> <b>bodies.</b> The tilt and shift movements can be independently rotated in any direction.|$|E
50|$|Other main {{differences}} included focusing drive {{built into}} the <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> for use with standard lens, removable back, shutter speed knob integral with film wind knob placed {{at the front of}} the <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> and finished in black.|$|R
50|$|A {{technique}} that requires no additional capabilities of any <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> - lens combination consists of stabilizing the entire <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> externally {{rather than using}} an internal method. This is achieved by attaching a gyroscope to the <b>camera</b> <b>body,</b> usually utilizing the camera's built-in tripod mount. This allows the external gyro to stabilize the camera, and is typically employed in photography from a moving vehicle, when a lens or camera offering another type of image stabilization is not available.|$|R
50|$|The <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> was {{designed}} by Marc Newson.|$|R
50|$|Lensbaby lenses mount {{directly}} onto SLR or mirrorless <b>camera</b> <b>bodies.</b> They have interchangeable drop in optics. Currently the lineup of lenses come with an optic installed.|$|E
50|$|Though {{designed}} for Sony's full frame E-mount cameras, the lens {{can be used}} on Sony's APS-C E-mount <b>camera</b> <b>bodies,</b> with a equivalent full-frame field-of-view of 150mm.|$|E
50|$|Its large {{diameter}} and relatively short flange focal distance of 44.0 mm allows mechanical adaptation of EF <b>camera</b> <b>bodies</b> to {{many types of}} non-EF lenses. It is possible to mount lenses using the Nikon F mount, Olympus OM, Leica R and universal M42 lens mounts (among others) {{by the use of}} a mechanical adapter without electronic control of the aperture or autofocus. Conversely, parfocal adaptation of EF lenses to non-EF <b>camera</b> <b>bodies</b> is not generally possible with only a mechanical adapter that does not contain optical elements.|$|E

50|$|Utilizing the SA-OB {{bayonet mount}} (on <b>camera</b> <b>bodies</b> {{supporting}} it), Nikon F-mount can be fitted and used via a JTAT mount adapter developed by Kazuo Suzuki, Tachibana Seisakusho.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{there are}} several {{secondary}} factors to consider. Lenses designed for a smaller image sensor may not be adaptable to <b>camera</b> <b>bodies</b> with larger sensors as the image circle may not {{be large enough to}} cover the entire sensor, and will therefore exhibit vignetting. The age of the camera body may limit the availability of adapters; as <b>camera</b> <b>bodies</b> typically reach obsolescence before lenses. Finally, some adapters may include electronic or mechanical provisions in order to control the lens aperture and autofocus, to record the correct Exif data, or to report focus confirmation.|$|E

50|$|An {{adapter ring}} has a female M42×0.75 metric thread {{on one side}} and a {{corresponding}} lens mount of the <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> on the other side. A T-adapter consists of an inner ring with T-mount thread and an external ring with corresponding lens mount. The T-ring and the T-2 ring are identical to each other. Both of them have the inner and outer ring. The two rings (inner and outer) are held together by 3 peripheral screws on the external ring. Loosening these screws allows rotation between the lens and the <b>camera</b> <b>body.</b> This is especially useful when the <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> is attached to telescopes or microscopes.|$|R
50|$|M Mount Adapter: A mount adapter {{that allows}} {{the use of a}} wide variety of M Mount lenses on the X Mount <b>camera</b> <b>body.</b> It also {{features}} electronic contacts for communicating signals with the <b>camera</b> <b>body</b> and a function button to allow users to easily choose necessary settings and functions (Shoot Without Lens, focal length settings, various image corrections, etc.).|$|R
