40|$|Abstract The {{occurrence}} of viable cells in mammary gland secretions attests the functionality {{of the defense}} system. This fact, along with applied medicine, is fundamental for the healing udder. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the in vitro viability of milk leukocytes challenged with four intramammary anti-mastitis drugs. We collected eight cow milk samples that were negative after a bacteriological examination. Cell suspensions were submitted to an evaluation of viability through Trypan Blue exclusion before and after incubation with the drugs. Mean pre-incubation viability rate (± standard deviation) of milk cells was 50. 17 % (± 6. 50). Mean post-incubation viability rates (± standard deviation) of control group (devoid of any drug), Drug 1 (anhydrous <b>cephalonium),</b> Drug 2 (gentamicin), Drug 3 (procaine benzylpenicillin associated with dihydrostreptomycin nafcillin), and Drug 4 (benzathine cloxacillin) were, respectively, 31. 36 % (± 3. 61); 26. 23 % (± 4. 49); 7. 82 % (± 2. 33); 3. 10 % (± 0. 94); and 30. 33 % (± 4. 14). The uppermost impairments were found when milk cells were challenged with Drug 2 and Drug 3. Although antimicrobial activity of tested drugs was not appraised, and a single aspect of cell function was tested, we concluded that treatments 2 and 3 could impair the functionality of milk leukocytes and could provide an ineffective immunological response, and an effective response is essential to control mammary infections...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{of an internal}} dry period teat sealer containing bismuth subnitrate (Product A; Teatseal, Cross Vetpharm Group Ltd, Ireland) was compared with a long-acting antibiotic preparation containing <b>cephalonium</b> (Product B; Cepravin Dry Cow, Schering-Plough Ltd, UK), by assessing {{the number of new}} intramammary infections (IMI) acquired during the dry period and the number of cases of clinical mastitis during the first 100 d of lactation. Selection of study animals was based on historical data. No cases of clinical mastitis and all routine cow level somatic cell counts ! 200, 000 cells/ml during the previous lactation were used to select cows likely to be uninfected with a major pathogen at drying off. Compared with the antibiotic tube, quarters that received the teat sealer acquired significantly fewer new IMI caused by Escherichia coli, all,Enterobacteriaceae, and all major pathogens combined. There was no significant differences in the number of IMI caused by any other major pathogen. There {{was no significant difference in}} the severity or number of quarter or cow cases of clinical mastitis between product groups. Sixty quarters (3. 2 %) were infected with major pathogens at drying off, 27 (2. 9 %) in teat sealer and 33 (3. 5 %) in antibiotic tube cows. The dry period cure rate was not significantly different (63 % product A, 70 % product B). This is the first controlled study to demonstrate the {{efficacy of}} an internal bismuth teat sealer in protecting quarters against new dry period IMI caused by major mastitis pathogens, particularly environmental organisms, under UK field conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{dry period}} is {{considered}} to be a phase when cows are very vulnerable to mastitis and phagocytosis mechanisms are specially important at this moment. The objective of the present trial was to evaluate the influence of dry cow therapy drugs available in the market on the phagocytic function of leukocytes obtained from cow milk. In order to do that, paired milk samples negative in bacteriological examination were submitted to in vitro phagocytosis test, after they were exposed to solutions of the following drugs: anhydrous <b>cephalonium</b> (M 1), Gentamicin (M 2), Benzylpenicillin procaine associated with Nafcillin and Dihydrostreptomycin (M 3) and Cloxacillin benzathine (M 4). Mean phagocytosis rates of control samples and of cells submitted to treatments M 1 and M 3 were, respectively, (58. 88 % ± 12. 04), (64. 87 % ± 15. 36) and (65. 14 % ± 17. 96) there were no differences among these samples, as well as in the comparison with the control group. Mean phagocytosis rate obtained in cells submitted to treatment M 4 (46. 90 % ± 22. 08) was lower than that of the control group, and than that of cells submitted to treatments M 1 and M 3. On the other hand, mean phagocytosis rate of cells submitted to treatment M 2 (0. 68 % ± 1. 63) was lower than that observed in the control group, and than that of all other treatments. These results show that the use of drugs available for dry cow therapy may no be totally innocuous for the host. KEY WORDS: Dry period, mastitis, phagocytosis, treatment. O período seco é considerado uma fase da lactação muito vulnerável à mastite, e os mecanismos de fagocitose são especialmente importantes nessa etapa. Para avaliar a influência de medicamentos indicados para o tratamento de mastite no período seco sobre a função fagocítica de leucócitos obtidos do leite de vacas, foram utilizadas amostras pareadas de leite de vacas, negativas ao exame bacteriológico. Submeteram-se essas células à prova de fagocitose in vitro, após serem expostas à solução contendo os seguintes medicamentos: cefalônio anidro (M 1), gentamicina (M 2), benzilpenicilina procaína em associação com naficilina e dihidroestreptomicina (M 3) e cloxacilina benzatina (M 4). A média dos índices de fagocitose das amostras-controle e das células submetidas aos tratamentos M 1 e M 3 foram, respectivamente, (58, 88 % ± 12, 04), (64, 87 % ± 15, 36) e (65, 14 % ± 17, 96) e não apresentaram diferenças entre si, bem como em relação ao controle. A média dos índices de fagocitose das células submetidas ao tratamento M 4 (46, 90 % ± 22, 08) mostrou-se menor que o controle, assim como menor do que aquela obtida das células submetidas aos tratamentos M 1 e M 3. Por sua vez, a média dos índices de fagocitose das células submetidas ao tratamento M 2 (0, 68 % ± 1, 63) foi expressivamente inferior àquelas encontradas no controle e nos demais tratamentos. Tais resultados sugerem a utilização de certos medicamentos comercializados para o tratamento de mastite no período seco, já que alguns deles evidenciaram não ser completamente inócuos ao hospedeiro.

40|$|O uso de medicamentos antimamíticos específicos para vacas no período seco é indicado para prevenção de infecções na lactação seguinte. Não obstante, a ação das células envolvidas no período de secagem tem {{fundamental}} importância para a involução da glândula mamária e seu restabelecimento para a lactação subseqüente. A indisponibilidade de tais medicamentos para uso em cabras tem resultado na extrapolação do uso de produtos recomendados para vacas sem que se considerem as particularidades e diferenças anátomo-fisiológicas entre as espécies bovina e caprina. O presente estudo teve por objetivo avaliar a influência de cinco antimamíticos específicos para vacas secas sobre a função dos fagócitos provenientes de leite caprino. Para tal, fez-se o isolamento de células somáticas de 20 amostras de leite provenientes de 10 cabras lactantes, sem antecedentes de tratamento de mamite nos últimos 30 dias, sob condições higiênico-sanitárias de colheita e com resultados negativos ao cultivo microbiológico do leite. As células aderidas a lamínulas de vidro foram confrontadas com formulações contendo princípios ativos disponíveis no mercado como Gentamicina (M 1), Cefalônio Anidro (M 2), Ampicilina (M 3), Cloxacilina Benzatínica (M 4) e Cefapirina Benzatínica (M 5). Avaliou-se, por microscopia, a fagocitose de partículas de Zymosan. As médias dos índices de fagocitose das células submetidas ao tratamento com M 2 (15, 12 % ± 16, 22), M 3 (6, 02 % ± 7, 96), M 4 (4, 54 % ± 5, 45) e M 5 (2, 47 % ± 4, 64) foram menores (p The use {{of specific}} anti-mastitis drugs is indicated in dry cow therapy to prevent infections {{in the following}} lactation. Nonetheless, cells active in the dry period are of fundamental importance for the involution of the mammary gland and its recovery for the following lactation. Since there are no specific drugs for dry goat therapy, the dry cow therapy drugs tend to be misused in goats despite of the anatomical and physiological differences apart from the particularities of the two species. The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the influence of five drugs specific for dry cow therapy on the function of goat milk phagocytes. Somatic cells were isolated from 20 milk samples of 10 lactating goats that had not been treated for mastitis during the previous 30 days. Milk samples were collected properly and microbiological culture yielded negative results. Cells adherent to glass coverslips were treated with commercially available dry cow therapy drugs containing active principles such as Gentamicin (M 1), <b>Cephalonium</b> anhydrous (M 2), Ampicillin (M 3), Cloxacillin benzathine (M 4) and Cephapirin benzathine (M 5). Phagocytosis of Zymosan particles was evaluated. Mean phagocytosis indexes of cells treated with M 2 (15. 12 % ± 16. 22), M 3 (6. 02 % ± 7. 96), M 4 (4. 54 % ± 5. 45) and M 5 (2. 47 % ± 4. 64) were lower (p< 0. 001) than mean phagocytosis index of the control group (40. 67 % ± 19. 68). Mean phagocytosis index of cells treated with M 2 was greater (p< 0. 05) than those treated with M 3, M 4 and M 5, whereas means of the latter three treatments were statistically similar. M 1 -treated cells did not adhere adequately to the cover slips, making it impossible to evaluate phagocytosis in this group. The results obtained enable the conclusion that drugs used affected milk phagocytes negatively. However, interference on somatic cell function is not the sole factor determining an unsuccessful dry period therapy, since the efficacy of the active principle on pathogens responsible for infectious processes also has to be considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to compare the efficacy of six intramammary dry-cow antibiotic preparations for curing existing IMI and for preventing the introduction of new IMI during the dry period. The effect of factors such as parity, milk yield, udder depth, teat canal integrity, number of infected quarters per cow, quarter-site infections and somatic cell count at drying off on cure-rates and new IMI as well as the length of the dry period and rainfall during the dry period were examined. The possible influence of treatment on the SCC during the subsequent lactation was also examined. Prior to the study a herd survey was performed to determine the basic udder health status of the trial herd. Cows due for drying off were clinically evaluated for enrollment and randomly allocated to receive one of the six dry-cow intramammary products under investigation. The six products that were studied were Nafpenzal DC (procaine benzylpenicillin, nafcillin and dihydrostreptomycin), Rilexine 500 DC (cephalexin and neomycin sulphate), Orbenin Extra DC (cloxacillin), Cepravin Dry Cow (<b>cephalonium),</b> Bovaclox DC (cloxacillin and ampicillin) and Dispolac Dry Cow (procaine benzylpenicillin and dihydrostreptomycin). Quarter milk samples were collected at drying off, (prior to treatment), and 1 to 6 days after calving for determination of the SSC and presence of micro-organisms in the milk. Cows were closely observed during the dry period and udders were clinically examined on a weekly basis and post-calving till udder oedema disappeared. Data from 162 cows and 648 quarters are summarized. The following were determined · Prevalence of pathogens at drying off and post-calving · Overall cure-rate and new intramammary infection rate. · Comparative efficacy of dry-cow treatment on cure-rate and prevention of new IMI. · Effect of parity, milk yield at drying off, udder depth, teat canal integrity, SCC, quarter-site infection, number of infected quarters at drying off, length of the dry period and rainfall during the dry period. · Effect of treatment on three SCC post calving during the subsequent lactation. Clinical mastitis developed in two quarters of two cows (1, 03 %) during the dry period which was less than described in literature, and they were removed from the trial. The prevalence of pathogens at drying off was 29, 78 %, of which 7, 87 % and 21, 91 % were due to major and minor pathogens respectively. The prevalence of pathogens post-calving was 22, 22 %, a net reduction of 7, 56 %, of which 4, 47 % and 17, 75 % were due to major and minor pathogens respectively. The overall cure-rate was 83, 94 % for quarters and varied between 72, 3 % and 93, 9 % for the various products. The overall difference in the percentage of cases cured, compared to the different micro-organisms, was found to be only marginally significant (p< 0, 057). High cure- rates were observed for STA, SAG and non-agalactiae pathogenic streptococci compared to studies previously done, while lower cure-rates than described were observed with CNS. Antimicrobial products used in this trial differed substantially in their efficacy to cure Gram-positive IMI. Cure rates for Cepravin Dry Cow was 93, 9 %, Orbenin Extra DC 91, 5 %, Rilexine 500 DC 85, 7 %, Nafpenzal DC 79, 2 %, Bovaclox DC 75, 0 % and Dispolac Dry Cow 72, 4 %. Interestingly, but not of any significance, was an observation that the two products with the highest overall cure-rates both contained only one antimicrobial agent compared to the other 4 products which were combinations of two or more antimicrobials. There was no significant association between parity, milk yield, teat canal integrity, number of infected quarters per cow, quarter-site infections at drying off, length of the dry period and rainfall during the dry period and the cure-rate. However, there was a significant association between udder depth (p< 0, 0056) and SCC (p< 0, 005) at drying off and cure-rate. The cure-rate was significantly less in cows with udder depth scores of 1 and 2 or SCC of more than 750 000 cells per ml milk at drying off. The overall rate of new IMI during the dry period was 17, 44 %. The new intramammary infection rate for quarters which received dry-cow treatment varied between 13, 4 % and 24, 1 % for the different products. The majority (70, 8 %) of new IMI were caused by CNS during the dry period. Almost all (96, 6 %) major pathogens isolated post-calving were new IMI, while 74, 1 % of minor pathogens were new IMI. Antimicrobial products differed in their efficacy in preventing new IMI during the dry period. The percentages of new IMI observed in cows treated with the six products were: 13, 2 % for Cepravin Dry Cow, 16, 3 % for Rilexine 500 DC, 16, 7 % for Dispolac Dry Cow, 17, 3 % for Bovaclox DC, 21, 4 % for Nafpenzal DC and 25, 9 % for Orbenin Extra DC. The probability of quarters developing new IMI during the dry period was significantly increased when cows were dried off with milk yields higher than 18 kg (p< 0, 0037) or had low udder depth (scores of 1 or 2) (p< 0, 0003). Higher parity cows (p< 0, 005) and those that had a teat canal score of 4 (p< 0, 039) and above at drying off were also at an increased risk for new IMI. Marginally significantly (p< 0, 06) more IMI were contracted {{on the left side of}} the udder than the right side of the udder and cows at drying off and cows with dry periods longer than 80 days had marginally (p< 0, 06) more new IMI during the dry period. A positive correlation was found between low SCC (< 250 000 cell per ml milk) and number of infected quarters per cow and parity (less than 3 lactations) at drying off. There was no significant association between the SCC at drying off and new IMI during the dry period. Significantly fewer new IMI (p< 0, 05) were observed when no rain fell during the dry period, compared to cows that experienced rain during their dry period. A comparison between the six antibiotic intramammary dry-cow products in relation to their efficacy in curing existing IMI and preventing new IMI showed qualitative differences between them, ranked as follows: Dispolac Dry Cow was the most effective and Orbenin Extra dry the least effective in preventing new IMI with major pathogens and Cepravin Dry Cow was to most and Nafpenzal DC the least effective in preventing new IMI with minor pathogens. Cepravin Dry cow was the most effective in the overall prevention of new IMIduring the dry period. Due to the random selection of cows the percentage of IMI differed for each product at the start of the trial. To compensate for this initial variation, percentage point improvement from drying off until calving was calculated for each antimicrobial product, taking both the cure-rates and new IMI into account. The efficacy of antimicrobial products during the dry period differed substantially when percentage point improvements were utilised: from an increase in IMI post-calving of 11, 73 % with Nafpenzal DC to a decrease of more than 50 % in IMI at calving with both Cepravin Dry Cow and Rilexine 500 DC. Cows dried off with Rilexine 500 DC had a significantly lower SCC for the first two months post-calving than those dried off with the other five products in this trial. It is concluded that a substantial difference in efficacy exists between antimicrobial intramammary dry-cow products in their ability to cure and prevent new IMI during the dry period. Dry cow therapy should form part of a holistic approach towards the dry period, which also includes cow factors, dry-cow management, micro-organisms and the environment of the dry cow. Cow factors (milk yields, udder depth, parity, TCS and quarter-site infections) mainly have an influence on new IMI but a few cow factors (udder depth and SCC) are associated with the cure-rate of IMI. Management and rainfall during the dry period mainly affected new IMI rather than the cure-rate of existing IMI. Dissertation (MSc (Veterinary Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.
