5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished {{to stay within the}} 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a <b>ceiling</b> <b>on</b> tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that {{the federal government}} was still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E
5|$|The 1998–99 NBA lockout was {{the third}} lockout of four {{in the history of}} the National Basketball Association (NBA). It lasted from July 1, 1998, to January 20, 1999, and forced the 1998–99 regular season to be {{shortened}} to 50 games per team and that season's All-Star Game to be canceled. NBA owners reopened the league's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in March 1998, seeking changes to the league's salary cap system and a <b>ceiling</b> <b>on</b> individual player salaries. The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) opposed the owners' plans and wanted raises for players who earned the league's minimum salary. After the two sides failed to reach an agreement, the owners began the lockout.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{means of}} paying for the statue was a commemorative coin. In early 1899, the commission sought enactment of legislation granting it an appropriation of $50,000 {{in the form of}} 100,000 commemorative half dollars, that could be sold to the public at a premium. Such a method had helped to finance (though with mixed success) the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Instead, Congress passed and McKinley signed on March 3, 1899, a civil appropriations bill that included provision for 50,000 silver one-dollar pieces to be granted to the commission. The bullion for the striking was to be purchased on the open market and was not to come from the Mint's remaining stocks acquired pursuant to the repealed Sherman Silver Purchase Act, though the Mint would not exhaust its inventory from that legislation until 1904. Congress placed a <b>ceiling</b> <b>on</b> the cost of the silver at $25,000. In the event, the United States Treasury bought 38,675.875 troy ounces of silver for $23,032.80. The designs were to be selected by the Mint Director, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.|$|E

5|$|Padayappa {{launched}} {{production at}} the Ragavendra Kalyana Mandapam on 1 October 1998. The film's climax scene {{was one of the}} first to be shot, and was filmed in one take using two cameras. Around 2,000 extras were used for the scene. The car that was used in the scene which introduced Neelambari in the film belonged to Ravikumar. Ravikumar used the newly purchased car in the film at Rajinikanth's insistence. Filming also took place in Mysore. The Vadapalani-based shop, D. V. Nehru wigs, supplied the wigs that were sported by Ganesan in the film. In an August 2016 interview with Sudhir Srinivasan of The Hindu, Ravikumar mentioned that a scene where Padayappa uses his dupatta to pull down a swing from the <b>ceiling</b> <b>on</b> which he sits after not being given a chair to sit by Neelambari, was inspired by a sequence in the Indian epic Ramayana. The sequence features the Hindu god Hanuman making a seat using his tail after Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, does not provide the former a chair to sit.|$|E

25|$|The {{president}} {{opted to}} use price ceilings on tortillas that protected local consumers of corn. This price control {{came in the}} form of the Tortilla Price Stabilization Pact between the government and many of the main tortilla producing companies, including Grupo Maseca and Bimbo, to put a price ceiling at 8.50 pesos per kilogram of tortilla. The hope was that a <b>ceiling</b> <b>on</b> corn prices would provide incentive for the market to lower all prices nationally.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{study the}} capital {{accumulation}} and welfare implications of <b>ceilings</b> <b>on</b> loan {{interest rates in}} a dynamic general equilibrium model. Binding <b>ceilings</b> <b>on</b> loan rates reduce the probability of bankruptcy. Lower bankruptcy rates result in lower bankruptcy and liquidation costs. The authors state conditions under which the resources freed by this cost-saving result increase the steady state capital stock, reduce steady state credit rationing, and raise the steady state welfare of all agents. The authors also argue that the conditions stated {{are likely to be}} satisfied in practice. Finally, their results hold even if initially there is capital over-accumulation.

25|$|While {{the laws}} {{governing}} wages initially set a <b>ceiling</b> <b>on</b> compensation, they were eventually {{used to set}} a living wage. An amendment to the Statute of Labourers in 1389 effectively fixed wages {{to the price of}} food.

25|$|The {{family home}} Palace (tharavadu) {{is located in}} the village of Chendamangalam, in Ernakulam district. After the passing of the Land Reform Ordinance, the family lost a lot of land that it owned. The {{ordinance}} set a <b>ceiling</b> <b>on</b> how much land an individual or family could own. As a result, the family wealth and property was partitioned in 1952. The number of members at the time of partition was 213 and the deed was registered in 1956. In addition to being the largest Joint-Hindu family, the deed was the biggest partition deed of Travancore-Cochin/Kerala.|$|E

30|$|Other banks include joint-stock {{commercial}} banks, policy banks, credit cooperatives, {{and urban}} commercial banks. All of these together comprise {{a little over}} half of lending activity in China. These institutions, along with the Big Four, are constrained by interest rate <b>ceilings</b> <b>on</b> deposits and lending quotas. Interest rate <b>ceilings</b> <b>on</b> deposits pinch the potential returns on savings that depositors may earn. In times of higher inflation, real returns on deposits have even {{turned out to be}} negative. Savers have few viable savings and investment outlets other than bank deposits, and the deposit interest rate ceiling reinforces their dissatisfaction with China’s financial system. What is more, lending quotas may restrict the amount of loans that banks can lend.|$|R

A second SALT agreement, SALT II, was signed in June 1979 in Vienna. Among other provisions, it placed an aggregate <b>ceiling</b> <b>on</b> ICBM and SLBM launchers. The second SALT agreement was never ratified by the United States Senate, {{in large part because}} of the breakdown of détente in the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Imposing <b>ceilings</b> <b>on</b> the {{interest}} rate has recently {{become one of the}} new hottest topics in microfinance industry; various debates have been discussing this issue to know the effect of interest rate <b>ceilings</b> <b>on</b> the supply of credit in particular and on microfinance industry in general. However in spite of the good intention behind these ceilings, there was no absolute result stating that ceilings have really contributed to the improvement or protection of the poor clients, indeed, these ceilings have hurt those low income people instead of helping them, due to these ceilings most of MFIs left the market or reduced their scale due to the inability to continue operating with low interest rate leaving the very poor clients without access to credit. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to review the impact of imposing such <b>ceilings</b> <b>on</b> {{the interest}} rates and to find out what alterative solutions can be employed as substitutes for them. This paper is entirely based on the secondary data collected from various records related to microfinance such as microfinance books, official websites and reports, published papers, and other sources related to the research subject...|$|R
40|$|Lactation is {{the most}} energetically {{expensive}} period for female mammals and is associated {{with some of the}} highest sustained metabolic rates (SusMR) in vertebrates (reported as total energy throughput). Females typically deal with this energy demand by increasing food intake and the structure of the alimentary tract may act as the central constraint to <b>ceilings</b> <b>on</b> SusMR at about seven times resting or standard metabolic rate (SMR). However, demands of lactation may also be met by using a form of metabolic compensation such as reducing locomotor activities or entering torpor. In some phocid seals, cetaceans and bears, females fast throughout lactation and thus cannot offset the high energetic costs of lactation through increased food intake. We demonstrate that fasting grey seal females sustain, for several weeks, one of the highest total daily energy expenditures (DEE; 7. 4 x SMR) reported in mammals, while progressively reducing maintenance metabolic expenditures during lactation through means not explained by reduction in lean body mass or behavioural changes. Simultaneously, the energy-exported in milk is progressively increased, associated with increased lipoprotein lipase activity in the mammary gland, resulting in greater offspring growth. Our results suggest that females use compensatory mechanisms to help meet the extraordinary energetic costs of lactation. Additionally, although the concepts of SusMR and <b>ceilings</b> <b>on</b> total DEE may be somewhat different in fasting lactating species, our data on phocid seals demonstrate that metabolic <b>ceilings</b> <b>on</b> milk energy output, in general, are not constrained by the same kind of peripheral limitations as are other energy-consuming tissues. In phocid seals, the high <b>ceilings</b> <b>on</b> DEE during lactation, coupled with metabolic compensation, are undoubtedly important factors enabling shortened lactation...|$|R
