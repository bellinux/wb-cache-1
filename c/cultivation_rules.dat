40|$|The {{development}} {{and application of}} an expert system is described for screening alien woody plants for their invasive potential in South African fynbos. The system is proposed for use by potential introducers to demonstrate low invasive risk before importing woody alien species for <b>cultivation.</b> <b>Rules</b> for the system were derived from empirical evidence by quantifying invasion windows and barriers that have limited the set of widespread woody invaders (trees and shrubs) in fynbos to fewer than 20, out of several hundred introduced species. The system first compares broad-scale nvironmental conditions (climate and soil) between the home environment of a species and fynbos. Features of the plant in its home environment (basic life history traits, population characteristics, regeneration biology, habitat preferences) are then assessed. Finally, an assessment is made of life history adaptations to the prevailing fire regime in fynbos (juvenile period, fire-survival capacity of adult plants, seed bank longevity). The reasoning is explicit and the steps leading to a conclusion (high risk/low risk) can be retraced...|$|E
40|$|One {{of major}} issues dealing with forest {{management}} in Italy {{is the lack}} or the suspension of silvicultural practices over an increased share of the forest area, in progress since a few decades ago. The abandonment of rural areas, the emerging environmental functions being nowadays addressed to natural resources, include also many forests and management systems formerly devoted mainly to wood production. This occurrence has its major evidence on coppice forests, i. e. about a {{half of the country}} forest area and the forest type historically submitted to the more intensive management practices. The results of an experimental trial started in 1972 in a beech coppice aged 27, i. e. a few years after the age of traditional rotation, comparing the natural evolutive pattern as well as the silvicultural practices aimed at its conversion into high forest, are here reported. The trial included the control thesis and three different thinning intensities. Each thesis was arranged within the same thinning type, taking into account the volume of former standing crop in each plot. The analysis includes the growth pattern and the dynamics of stand structure in the populations under natural evolution and under conversion into high forest. Four inventories were carried out since 1972 at each decade up to 2002. Three thinnings were undertaken within the same time. Results show that both the tested management options, alternative and/or complementary to the traditional coppice system, are based on reliable biological assumptions. The natural evolutive pattern highlights the growth trend at ages older than those monitored under the coppice system. Beech shows a peculiar behaviour in the range observed due to its specific shade-tolerance. The shoot population reveals a sustained growth between the ages of 30 to 40; then, the occurrence of a heavy, regular mortality up to 50; finally, the recovery of a high growth rate up to the age of 60 (ending of the monitored period at now). Such growth pattern moves up the current volume increment, delays its intersection to mean increment and postpones substantially the age of growth rates culmination. The observed trend deviates from the canonical stand growth pattern and seems to be grounded on beech auto-ecology. This extends the time of reaction between the opposite feedbacks of mortality and growth and allows monitoring a likely different behaviour ruling ageing coppice growth. The same occurrence had not been highlighted before studying light-demanding species (deciduous oaks in the case) under the same stand types, these species being able to settle much more rapidly the cycle mortality-growth recovery-incremental culmination. The thesis of conversion into high forest provides the technical <b>cultivation</b> <b>rules</b> (type, intensity and interval of thinning repetition) and suggests it as enforceable also in the private domain due to the shortly-repeated harvestings and intermediate volumes that make each intervention profitable. The basic outcomes of the applied silvicultural practices are (i) the early crown shaping of shoot dendrotypes; (ii) the modeling of clustered stand structure; (iii) the individual development of well-balanced trees, more suited to tackle the grown-up and mature stages till the time of regeneration from seed, ending of the transitory cycle. st 1 behavior:url(#ieooui) /* Style Definitions */ table.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{identify}} {{a new group}} of aesthetic norms, which I call norms of cultivation. Judgments of taste are often accompanied by forecasts or expectations about future aesthetic satisfaction. When we find something beautiful, we expect to find it beautiful in the future. Forecasting is at play in all sorts of aesthetically motivated behavior. Yet psychologists have observed an unreliability in such forecasts. As a result of forecasting error, what we take as our taste can be an unreliable guide in our aesthetic lives. Compensating for the unreliability of taste are norms of <b>cultivation,</b> implicit <b>rules</b> for engaging objects, such as avoiding overexposure to favored objects or exposure under unfavorable conditions. Norms of cultivation help to regularize aesthetic experience, mitigating unreliability in forecasts, and fostering the ongoing stability and coherence of taste...|$|R
40|$|Mulberry tree, a plant of {{the family}} of Moraceae and genus Morus, has been widely {{cultivated}} to feed silkworm for the production of silk. Until the past century, in Italy the mulberry <b>cultivation</b> was <b>ruled</b> by regulations which forbade to cut down this plant. But, after the coming in the market of the synthetic textile fibres, the silk production diminished and so the cultivation of mulberry was almost forgotten. At present, it can be found as ornamental or wild plant in marginal areas. Nevertheless, other utilizations, beyond silkworm feeding, are possible for mulberry. For example, leaves could be used for the preparation of protein concentrates for animal or human nutrition and for extracting compounds with either pharmaceutical activity or textile fibres colouring ability. This paper describes experiments carried out for the extraction of flavonoids from mulberry, the major responsible compounds for the claimed therapeutic benefits ascribed to mulberry in the folk medicine, in order to study if the recovery of such substances, together with other products, can make suitable the growing, management and processing of mulberry and so allow the conservation of this historical plant...|$|R
40|$|Before {{the spread}} of {{extensive}} settled cultivation, the Indian subcontinent would have been inhabited by territorial hunter–gatherers and shifting cultivators with cultural traditions of prudent resource use. The disruption of closed material cycles by export of agricultural produce to centres of non-agricultural population would have weakened these traditions. Indeed, the fire-based sacrificial ritual and extensive agricultural settlements might have catalysed the destruction of forests and wildlife and the suppression of tribal peoples during the agricultural colonization of the Gangetic plains. Buddhism, Jainism and later the Hindu sects may have been responses {{to the need for}} a reassertion of ecological prudence once the more fertile lands were brought under <b>cultivation.</b> British <b>rule</b> radically changed the focus of the country's resource use pattern from production of a variety of biological resources for local consumption to the production of a few commodities largely for export. The resulting ecological squeeze was accompanied by disastrous famines and epidemics between the 1860 s and the 1920 s. The counterflows to tracts of intensive agriculture have reduced such disasters since independence. However, these are quite inadequate to balance the state-subsidized outflows of resources from rural hinterlands. These imbalances have triggered serious environmental degradation and tremendous overcrowding of the niche of agricultural labour and marginal cultivator all over the country...|$|R
2500|$|Increases in {{urbanization}} and in {{the area}} under <b>cultivation</b> during Roman <b>rule</b> caused wholesale dislocations of the Berber society, forcing nomad tribes to settle or to move from their traditional rangelands. Sedentary tribes lost their autonomy and connection with the land. Berber opposition to the Roman presence was nearly constant. The Roman emperor Trajan established a frontier in the south by encircling the Aurès and Nemencha mountains and building a line of forts from Vescera (modern Biskra) to Ad Majores (Hennchir Besseriani, southeast of Biskra). The defensive line extended {{at least as far}} as Castellum Dimmidi (modern Messaâd, southwest of Biskra), Roman Algeria's southernmost fort. Romans settled and developed the area around Sitifis (modern Sétif) in the 2nd century, but farther west the influence of Rome did not extend beyond the coast and principal military roads until much later.|$|R
50|$|The total {{estimated}} revenue {{of the province}} in 1949-50 was Rs. 62.98 lakhs and the estimated expenditure stood at Rs. 87.69 lakhs. The main products of Coorg include coffee, tea and rubber. Coorg was one of India's largest producers of tea {{with a total of}} 415 acres under tea <b>cultivation.</b> During the <b>rule</b> of the Coorg Rajahs, rice was the most important crop cultivated. It was replaced by coffee when the state passed into British rule. The first coffee plantation was established near Mercara in 1854. From 1854 to 1870, coffee cultivation in Coorg expanded rapidly as exports increased from 579 tons in 1857 to 3,000 tons in 1867 and 4,880 tons in 1876. Coffee production slowed down due to a blight in 1870 in 1871 but recovered quickly reaching the peak of production between 1878 and 1883. Coffee prices fell by 40 percent between 1879 and 1889 due to the competition of imported Brazilian coffee on the local market but recovered in 1890 when there was a shortage of supply from Brazil. With fluctuating fortunes, coffee continues to be Coorg's most important source of revenue.|$|R
5000|$|The Spanish had {{an empire}} across Europe, and brought {{potatoes}} for their armies. Peasants {{along the way}} adopted the crop, which was less often pillaged by marauding armies than above-ground stores of grain. Across most of Northern Europe, where open fields prevailed, potatoes were strictly confined to small garden plots because field agriculture was strictly governed by custom that prescribed seasonal rhythms for plowing, sowing, harvesting and grazing animals on fallow and stubble. This meant that potatoes were barred from large-scale <b>cultivation</b> because the <b>rules</b> allowed only grain to be planted in the open fields. [...] In France and Germany government officials and noble landowners promoted the rapid conversion of fallow land into potato fields after 1750. The potato thus became an important staple crop in northern Europe. Famines in the early 1770s contributed to its acceptance, as did government policies in several European countries and climate change during the Little Ice Age, when traditional crops in this region did not produce as reliably as before. At times and places when and where most other crops failed, potatoes could still typically be relied upon to contribute adequately to food supplies during colder years.|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2013. Major: Geography. Advisors: Vinay Gidwani, Bruce Braun. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 227 pages. Practices of cultivation {{and control over}} land are deeply entangled matters in Israel-Palestine. By {{the turn of the}} twentieth century scientists had begun to systematically examine the cultivation practices of Arab farmers. Around the same time, the area was the scene of major land struggles as both Palestinian Arabs and Zionist groups sought to establish control over land. In the study of modern Historic Palestine, the cultivation practices of Palestinians and the contest for control over land have each constituted abundant but generally separate scholarly arenas. However, the relationship between the two furnishes a productive sphere of empirical and conceptual inquiry into the broad set of relations between forms of political community and claims to land. The entangled relation is illustrated by the legal distinction between cultivated and uncultivated land, which is an important basis for the reclassification and appropriation of land by Israel. Thus, I argue that the question of cultivation, both of land and of people, emerges as a central problematic in the imagination of Israel-Palestine as a geographical realm. 	This dissertation explores the question of cultivation through two central modes of inquiry. Cultivation in the first sense is understood to be an abstract concept that allows the state to enact technologies of <b>rule.</b> <b>Cultivation</b> in the second sense is a concrete practice of farmers who leverage the capacities of the land to affirm claims to territory. Drawing from literary and historical concepts as well as fieldwork, I show that modern colonialism requires the classification and adjudication of cultivation practices to justify land appropriation. I further illustrate that this reliance on cultivation paradoxically produces a site of contestation that at once engages and unsettles legal categories. This study requires rethinking the history of cultivation not as linear development but rather through a series of contingent moments or shadow spaces. These moments produce a narrative that summons traces of past events and folds them into the present. More generally, such an understanding of history and geography enables me to explore not only what was foreclosed at a given conjuncture, but also better understand the present condition...|$|R
