5|$|Bart is {{visited by}} Erman Millwood, whose company makes films out of web cartoon series. Millwood offers Bart a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film {{adaptation}} of the web cartoon Angry Dad. Bart accepts, and Millwood takes him to film studio animators. Homer is soon offered the opportunity to voice Angry Dad, as the voice actor from the original Angry Dad series has dropped out of frustration of never being paid. The film is test screened to a horrible reception. Lisa convinces Bart to remove all of the parts the audience did not like, thus making the Angry Dad a short film. The film is shortly thereafter nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Animated Short.|$|E

Basic flight controls were installed in the observer's cockpit and folded {{out of the way}} when not in use. They were connected to the elevators, rudder and throttle but not to the ailerons, and were intended to give observers a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> forced landing if the pilot was killed or incapacitated rather than to offer true dual control.|$|E

25|$|When Notre Dame {{athletic}} director Kevin White {{announced to the}} media that Davie would not be retained as head coach of Notre Dame, he cited a disappointing season with the Irish heading {{in the wrong direction}} on the field. A week after the firing of Davie, George O'Leary, seven–year head coach of Georgia Tech, was hired by Notre Dame for the head coaching position. Five days after being hired, however, O'Leary resigned from the position, because of discrepancies on his résumé about receiving a varsity letter and a master's degree while in school. While O'Leary was criticized for lying, some said it gave Notre Dame a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> better decision. Finally, two weeks after O'Leary resigned, Notre Dame signed Tyrone Willingham, the seventh–year coach of Stanford, to a six-year contract, ending the Bob Davie era at Notre Dame.|$|E

While O'Leary was criticized for lying, some in the media said that his resignation gave Notre Dame a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> better decision. Two weeks after O'Leary resigned, Notre Dame signed Tyrone Willingham, the seventh-year coach of Stanford, to a six-year contract. Willingham became the school's first African American head coach in any sport. He immediately made changes to the Irish program, including changing the long used Irish offense from an option attack to a West Coast type. He also made his first-year Fighting Irish team only the second in Notre Dame history to pick captains on a game-by-game basis.|$|E

25|$|In September 1990 Chrétien {{seeing a}} <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> strong {{impression}} on public opinion after a shaky {{start as a}} leader reaped a major windfall after Mulroney introduced an unpopular Goods and Services Tax (GST), which Chrétien decided to vigorously oppose. Traditionally in Canada the government had levied a 13.5% Manufacturer's Sales Tax (MST), which was paid by manufacturers, who passed {{on the cost of}} the tax to consumers in the form of higher prices. Since foreign manufacturers did not pay the MST, this placed Canadian companies at a competitive disadvantage in their home market, and to compensate the government had levied tariffs on manufactured imports to maintain a level playing field. When the free trade agreement with the United States came into effect in 1989, the government could no longer levy tariffs on American imports, which led to furious complaints from Canadian industry about having to compete with American companies who did not pay the MST. To save Canadian industry and the jobs of those Canadians employed in manufacturing from being destroyed by American competition, the Mulroney government decided in late 1989 to abolish the MST and replace it with the 7% GST, whose costs would be borne by consumers. On the proposed GST, Chrétien was torn between his belief that the GST was economically necessary vs. his desire to score political points by opposing a proposed tax that most Canadians hated, and as such, he was initially vague about where he stood about the GST. It was only in September 1990 after months of vacillation did Chrétien finally make up his mind to oppose the GST.|$|E

He produced and recorded Terria, a [...] "highly illustrated stream-of-consciousness" [...] album, with Gene Hoglan on drums, Craig McFarland on bass and Jamie Meyer on keyboards. Townsend cited Ween's White Pepper as an inspiration for the album. Terria was released in November 2001.|$|E

500|$|As a {{character}} introduced in Soulcalibur, Astaroth's weapon, a giant axe, was decided upon before {{other aspects of}} the character were. His design revolved around it, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. Once established, his appearance and movement were fleshed out by the team's concept artist Aya Takemura and rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on the character. Astaroth was then animated mainly by Nobuko Nimura using motion capture and working directly with the team, while other motion designers created the movements for his grapple attacks. During this phase the team additionally worked with the Soulcalibur story creators, refining the character's own role in the plot as needed throughout development. Soulcalibur IV lead programmer Masaaki Hoshino called Astaroth his favorite character, stating that because he is [...] "so powerful there's always a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> comeback".|$|E
500|$|The {{photograph}} {{was one of}} several taken by Leibovitz of seven-months pregnant 28-year-old Moore, then carrying the couple's second daughter, Scout LaRue. The photographs ranged from Moore in lacy underwear and spiked high heels, to a revealing peignoir. The final selection had Moore wearing only a diamond ring. [...] Joanne Gair worked on make-up for the shoot. Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr., chairman of Conde Nast Publications, was very supportive of the chosen cover despite the potential for lost sales. Tina Brown, Vanity Fair editor, quickly realized that there would be harsh backlash for regular distribution of the magazine; the issue had to be wrapped in a white envelope with only Moore's eyes visible. Some editions had a brown wrapper that implied naughtiness. [...] However, Brown viewed the image as a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> statement about the decade of the 1990s after a decade dominated by power suits. Approximately 100 million people saw the cover.|$|E

Brown came to watch the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day, and was staying in the same hotel as the Rice team. He saw Humble and his wife Lorraine, whom Humble had met while in {{training}} at Southwestern, on a dance floor at the hotel. [...] "He appeared to be the sort of fellow we like to have on our team," [...] Brown said later in 1947. [...] "Then I watched him in that Tennessee game and after that made up my mind he'd be with my club if I ever had the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> deal for him."

500|$|The rumors {{concerning}} his sexuality {{led to a}} Gawker article linking him to a New York Post Page Six blind item about a closeted gay actor, nicknamed [...] "the Gay Rapist". Despite {{the victim of the}} alleged attack denying that it was Franco, two magazines then contacted Franco's lawyer to alert them that they might run stories suggesting his involvement, but were unable to, as at least part of their stories were fabricated. However, Gawker refused to take their article down as they were simply reporting what another outlet published and instead offered him a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> comment about the speculation on its website. He declined, hoping it would die down. The actor later called the episode very offensive because he has friends who have been raped. In July 2015, a former Gawker employee admitted on his Twitter account — in now deleted posts — that he was pressured to write a series of articles about [...] "the Gay Rapist", and lead readers into believing the man was Franco.|$|E

500|$|Half-Life: Opposing Force {{was first}} {{announced}} by developer Gearbox Software on April 15, 1999. In their press release, founder Randy Pitchford stated that [...] "our number one {{goal is to}} preserve the integrity of Half-Life and provide new experiences that expand upon the sensation of the original", and also announced that the expansion pack would allow the player to play {{as one of the}} soldiers featured in the original game. The name Opposing Force has a double meaning, referring both {{to the fact that the}} player is now one of the enemies in the original game, as well as to Newton's third law of motion. In a later interview, Pitchford stated that he believed that Valve Software offered Gearbox the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> Half-Life expansion was from a wish [...] "to focus on their future titles". In addition, Pitchford commented that Valve and Gearbox had agreed not to [...] "severely modify" [...] the game engine used by Half-Life and Opposing Force as it [...] "risks breaking all of the wonderful work" [...] that the game's custom content community was creating. Substantial information on Opposing Forces development direction, as well as new locations, characters and story were revealed at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo convention.

Carpenter's request was for Zombie to [...] "make it his own [...] ". Zombie's film would combine the elements of prequel and remake with the original concept, with considerable original content in the new film. Zombie also wanted to reinvent the character, as he felt Michael, along with Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Pinhead, had become too familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary. Zombie delved deeper into Michael Myers's mythology. Michael's mask was even given its own story to provide an explanation as to why he wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store, as in the original film. Zombie wanted to bring Michael closer to what a psychopath really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Björk starred on {{her acting}} debut Dancer in the Dark. Whilst {{she worked on}} the film, she also began {{producing}} her next album, writing new music and teaming with new collaborators.

[...] "Cocoon", produced by Knak, {{was one of the last}} songs to be written for the album; its melody came to Björk in a sudden rush and she contacted him. She made a long-distance, late-night phone call to Knak in Denmark, and woke him up. [...] "I didn't have any track of time so she didn't really know that I was asleep. She was explaining that she had this melody in her head and maybe, if I had the time, she would still have two or three weeks to decide if this track could be worked on", said the producer. Knak took it as a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> more minimal track, similar to his own releases. He liked the idea of having two songs on the album, and immediately after he put down the phone, he started working. His original treatment of [...] "Cocoon", made with an Ensoniq ASR-10, appeared relatively intact in the final version. Knak elaborated: [...] "She had two changes: one for one semitone up and another for I think about 20BPM slower or something.
