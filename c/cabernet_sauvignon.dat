5|$|While not as {{prolific}} in mutating as Pinot noir, nor {{as widely}} used in production of offspring, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> {{has been linked to}} other grape varieties. In 1961, a cross of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> and Grenache produced the French wine grape Marselan. Cygne blanc is a white-berried seedling of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> that was discovered in 1989 growing in a garden in Swan Valley, Western Australia. Cabernet blanc is a crossing of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> and an unknown hybrid grape variety that was discovered in Switzerland in the late 20th century.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} started {{to develop a}} {{presence}} in the Arizona, New York, Ohio, Texas and Virginia wine industries-particularly in the Texas Hill Country and North Fork of Long Island AVAs. Throughout the United States, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> is made in both varietal and blended styles. Under the American system, varietal <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> can include up to 25% other grapes.|$|E
5|$|The Bordeaux wine region {{accounts}} for more than 60% of the <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> grown in France. Outside of Bordeaux, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> is found in varying quantities throughout Le Midi and in the Loire Valley. In general, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> wines are lighter and less structured, drinkable much earlier than Bordeaux wine. In the southwest French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOCs) of Bergerac and Buzet it is used to make rosé wine. In some regions it is used to add flavor and structure to Carignan while it is blended with Négrette in Gaillac and Fronton as well as Tannat in Madiran. In Provence, the grape had some presence in the region in the mid 19th century, when viticulturist Jules Guyot recommended it as a blending partner with Syrah. In recent years, several Midi wine estates, such as Mas de Daumas Gassac have received international acclaim for their <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> blended in Hérault, with Rhône grapes like Syrah. It is often made as a single varietal in the vin de pays of the Languedoc. The influence of Australian flying winemakers has been considerable in how <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> is treated by some Languedoc wine estates, with some producers making wines that can seem like they are from the New World. Overall, the grape has not exerted it dominance of the region, generally considered less ideally situated to the dry climate than Syrah. The Languedoc producers who give serious consideration to <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon,</b> generally rely on irrigation to compensate for the climate.|$|E

5|$|In Argentina, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> {{lags behind}} Malbec as the country's main red grape but its numbers are growing. The varietal {{versions}} often have lighter fruit flavors and {{are meant to}} be consumed young. Premium examples are often blended with Malbec and produce full, tannic wines with leather and tobacco notes. In recent years, there have been increased plantings of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> in the Uco Valley of the Mendoza Province; the wines coming from vineyards planted at higher altitudes garner some international attention.|$|E
5|$|In Oregon {{there are}} small {{quantities}} of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> {{planted in the}} warmer southern regions of the Umpqua and Rogue Valleys.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} styles of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> to be a complementary pairing.|$|E

5|$|The grape's true origins were {{discovered}} in 1996 {{with the use of}} DNA typing at the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology, by a team led by Dr. Carole Meredith. The DNA evidence determined that <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> was the offspring of Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc and was most likely a chance crossing that occurred in the 17th century. Prior to this discovery, this origin had been suspected from the similarity of the grapes' names and the fact that <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> shares similar aromas with both grapes—such as the blackcurrant and pencil box aromas of Cabernet franc and the grassiness of Sauvignon blanc. In 2016 scientists at the UC Davis announced they had sequenced a draft of the whole genome of the <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> grape, the first genome of a commercial wine-producing grape to be sequenced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high tannin content {{as well as the}} oak influences and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well the wine matches with different foods. When <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E

40|$|In this research, we {{integrated}} {{an experimental}} auction with sensory science techniques—namely, trained sensory panels {{used to analyze}} the sensory attributes of wines—to examine the effects of objective and sensory information in the market for California-produced <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignons.</b> The experiment permitted observation of consumer valuation for sensory attributes of wine, appellations, expert ratings, and wineries. Participants submitted bids each time they received new information about the wines. The balanced experimental design permits evaluation of the effects of consumer characteristics on attribute valuation. We had 236 people participate in the research, which consisted of nine rounds of bidding and one round of hedonic liking scores. Rounds 5 - 9 repeated the structure of information released in rounds 1 - 4, but added sensory information, yielding 472 observations for each type of information (e. g. appellation, expert rating, winery). We obtain a total of 8496 valuations, or bids and 944 hedonic “liking” ratings, as well as demographic information, wine consumption data, and a wine knowledge score for each consumer. The results of the research agree with many of the previously held notions about valuation of wine by consumers. Participants value <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignons</b> from Napa Valley and Sonoma County and their sub-appellations more than wines labeled with the California appellation. Bids for wines rated by experts such as the Wine Advocate (Robert Parker) or Wine Spectator increased as the experts’ ratings increased. However, we also find that consumer characteristics are very important in explaining WTP for wine attributes. The contributions of prestigious appellations to the value of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignons</b> depended on consumer characteristics. Willingness to pay was highly correlated with sensory evaluation, but even after tasting the wine, appellation and expert ratings still mattered for WTP. Overall, the research describes a significant amount of heterogeneity in the preferences for sensory characteristics of wine, and that individual characteristics systematically explain many of the differences in valuation of wine attributes.

5|$|The Languedoc-Roussillon area {{is home to}} {{numerous}} grape varieties, including many international varieties like Merlot, <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon,</b> Sauvignon blanc, and Chardonnay. The traditional Rhône grapes of Mourvedre, Grenache, Syrah, and Viognier are also prominent.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenolic}} {{profiles of}} Queensland red wines (two <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignons</b> and one Shiraz) from {{different stages of}} wine-making were studied. Samples were taken at crush, after the primary and malolactic fermentations, post-oaking, and post-bottling, and then extracted and separated into aqueous and organic fractions using liquid liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction, and analysed by HPLC-DAD-MS. About 75 % of the phenolic compounds were extracted into the aqueous fraction, with malvidin- 3 -glucoside and derivatives as the main components. The major non-anthocyanin phenolic compounds (similar to 25 %) included gallic acid, syringic acid, ethyl gallate, caftaric acid, coutaric acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, catechin, and quercetin. The polymerisation of anthocyanins was shown to occur progressively throughout the wine-making process. Most of the 25 identified phenolic compounds had highest concentrations during the fermentation stage, and stabilised or slowly decreased thereafter. There were weak and insignificant correlations (P > 0. 05) between individual phenolic compounds and the total antioxidant activities (ORAC). Four groups of phenolic compounds (anthocyanins, hydroxybenzoic acids, flavanols and hydroxycinnamic acids) each showed some correlation with the total antioxidant activity, as did the total polyphenol content, suggesting that the antioxidant properties of red wine are due to a complex mixture of phenolic compounds that vary in composition throughout the wine-making process.

5|$|<b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> is {{the most}} widely planted red grape variety in Washington state {{according}} to the Washington State Wine Commission. It is generally found in the warmer sites of the Columbia Valley. The vines are choice plantings for growers due to their hardy vine stalks and resistance to the cold winter frost that is commonplace in Eastern Washington. Washington <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> is characterized by its fruitiness and easy drinking styles that are not overly tannic. Recent Washington American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) that have seen some success with their Cabernet Sauvignons include Red Mountain, Walla Walla Valley {{and parts of the}} Yakima Valley AVA near the Tri-Cities region.|$|E
5|$|During {{a series}} of trials between 1924 and 1930, the pollen of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> was used to {{fertilize}} Glera vines (the white wine grape {{used to make the}} sparkling wine Prosecco) to create the red Italian wine grape Incrocio Manzoni 2.15.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality and flavors of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E
5|$|Other {{varieties}} {{with significant}} production by harvested acres in 2016 are Syrah, Merlot, Tempranillo, Pinot blanc, Gewürztraminer, Viognier, <b>Cabernet</b> franc, Müller-Thurgau, <b>Sauvignon</b> blanc, and Zinfandel, V. vinifera based wines produced in smaller quantities include Arneis, Baco noir, Black Muscat, Chenin blanc, Dolcetto, Gamay noir, Grenache, Marechal Foch, Malbec, Muscat, Nebbiolo, Petite Syrah, Sangiovese, and Sémillon. The state also produces fruit wine, sparkling wine, late harvest wine, ice wine, and dessert wine.|$|R
50|$|From 1875-1892 {{almost all}} Bordeaux {{vineyards}} were ruined by Phylloxera infestations. The region's wine industry was rescued by grafting native vines on to pest-resistant American rootstock from Augusta, Missouri, the first vidacultural {{region in the}} United States. All Bordeaux vines that surviveto this day are thanks to this action. Some grape variety responded better to the grafting than others and these varieties-Cabernet <b>Sauvignon,</b> <b>Cabernet</b> franc, Merlot, Semillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle-became Bordeaux leading grapes.|$|R

5|$|In California, {{the main}} stylistic {{difference}} in <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> is between hillside/mountain vineyards {{and those on}} flatter terrain like valley floors or {{some areas of the}} Central Valley. In Napa, the hillside vineyards of Diamond Mountain District, Howell Mountain, Mt. Veeder, Spring Mountain District have thinner, less fertile soils which produces smaller berries with more intense flavors, reminiscent of Bordeaux wines that require years of aging to mature. The yields are also much lower, typically in the range of 1–2 tons per acre in contrast to the 4–8 tons that can be produced in the more fertile valley floors. Wines produced from mountainside vineyards tend to be characterized by deep inky colors and strong berry aromas. Throughout California there are many wine regions that have the potential to grow <b>Cabernet</b> <b>Sauvignon</b> to full ripeness and produce fruity, full-bodied wines with alcohol levels regularly above the Bordeaux average of 12–13%—often in excess of 14%.|$|E
