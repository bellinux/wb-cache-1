How and when it will make the right move and defeat its opponent. That's the only concern. This is not earnestness. The state calls on Armenian historians to discuss history, but does not shy from trying its own intellectuals who have an unorthodox rhetoric on the Armenian genocide. It restores an Armenian church in the Southeast, but only thinks, “How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> this for political gains in the world, how can I sell it?” ...|$|E

6000|$|Now, if any {{ask whether}} it be imaginable that an {{ordinary}} man of the wealthier type should analyse the problem or conceive the plan, the inhumanly far-seeing plan, as I have set it forth, the answer is: [...] "Certainly not." [...] Many rich employers are too generous to do such a thing; many are too stupid {{to know what they}} are doing. The eugenical opportunity I have described is but an ultimate analysis of a whole drift of thoughts in the type of man who does not analyse his thoughts. He sees a slouching tramp, with a sick wife and a string of rickety children, and honestly wonders what he can do with them. But prosperity does not favour self-examination; and he does not even ask himself whether he means [...] "How can I help them?" [...] or [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> them?"--what he can still do for them, or what they could still do for him. Probably he sincerely means both, but the latter much more than the former; he laments the breaking of the tools of Mammon much more than the breaking of the images of God. It would be almost impossible to grope in the limbo of what he does think; but we can assert that there is one thing he doesn't think. He doesn't think, [...] "This man might be as jolly as I am, if he need not come to me for work or wages." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kierkegaard says love is no dream or mood or {{the kind}} of self-love that only thinks of love in {{relation}} to itself. Kierkegaard uses the Socratic Method to question himself in relation to love and advises all to do likewise. Christ said to love your neighbor as yourself, which implies two commands. Kierkegaard thinks of this {{in relation to the}} title of his work. If there is this power of love that can hide my sins from God, then <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> this same power and hide my sins from my own self? <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> this same power to hide my neighbor's sins from myself and {{from the rest of the}} world? He asks about the judgment from without, the judgment of the world, and says that it always finds what it seeks. It depends upon how it sees. [...] But now how does this love arise in a person’s soul? This love that is able “to interpret itself to itself; make itself understandable to the single individual even if not another soul understood it”.|$|E

Captain America Annual #10 {{features}} a prologue to the upcoming Nomad ongoing series. Again written by Nicieza, the series lasted 25 issues (May 1992-May 1994) and featured artwork from several artists, most notably Pat Olliffe and S. Clarke Hawbaker. At {{one point in}} the series Monroe spends an extended period in Los Angeles, California and in one issue (#9; January 1993) Nicieza addresses the subject of the 1992 Los Angeles riots which had recently occurred when the story was first published.

5000|$|In 734, Zhang {{proposed}} that private citizens {{be allowed to}} mint money. Pei opposed, {{pointing out that the}} quality of the coins would be greatly reduced. Emperor Xuanzong, with opposition also from Liu Zhi, decided not to allow private minting. Later that year, Pei was made Shizhong (侍中), the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. Pursuant to Pei's proposal, a shipping station was built {{at the point where the}} Yellow River and the Bian River joined, with two large food storages—Heyin Storage (河陰倉) to the east and Boyai Storage (柏崖倉) to the west. At Sanmenxia, Jijin Storage (集津倉) was built to the east, and Yan Storage (鹽倉) was built to the west. A road 18 li long (roughly nine kilometers) was built from Sanmenxia to the Wei River. With Pei's plan implemented, the government received considerably savings during the next three years, and Pei's subordinates suggested that he submitted the surpluses to the emperor as a tribute. Pei stated, [...] "This is money saved for the government. How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> it to ingratiate the emperor?" [...] Instead, he saved the money for future transportation improvements.|$|E
5000|$|Historical {{accounts}} {{also did}} not discuss most of Wang Yanxi's activities during the next three rulers of Min—Wang Yanxi's older brothers Wang Yanhan and Wang Yanjun (also known as Wang Lin, Emperor Huizong), and nephew (Wang Yanjun's son) Wang Jipeng (also known as Wang Chang, Emperor Kangzong). Based on the timing of subsequent events, it appeared likely (although not conclusively so) {{that at some point}} while still being a subject, he married the daughter of the official Li Zhen (李真) as his wife. (It is possible that he married her after he became emperor.) It is known, however, that {{there was a time when}} an emissary of Silla offered a sword to Wang Jipeng as a gift at a feast. When Wang Jipeng showed it to the chancellor Wang Tan (王倓) and asked Wang Tan, [...] "What <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> it for?" [...] and Wang Tan responded, [...] "You can use it to behead unfaithful subjects," [...] Wang Yanxi, who happened to be at the feast as well and who was already secretly having designs on the throne, was so shocked that his expressions changed. [...] At one point, Wang Yanxi apparently received the titles of Zuo Pushe (左僕射) and chancellor (同中書門下平章事, Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi), but fearing that Wang Jipeng would suspect him, he pretended to be crazy and dumb. Wang Jipeng thereafter gave him Taoist monk's robes, and placed him in the Wuyi Mountains, but later recalled him to the capital Changle (長樂, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian) and put him under house arrest.|$|E
