5|$|Currently the harbour {{is being}} {{enlarged}} {{in order to}} accommodate larger vessels, especially <b>cruise</b> <b>ships.</b> From 2015 the enlarged harbour is expected to attract up to 40 large <b>cruise</b> <b>ships</b> per year compared to about a dozen smaller ships at present. The new harbour should provide new jobs increasing the workforce in the harbour from 2,000 today to some 2,600 on completion. Karstens Skibsværft, Danish Yacht, and the herring processing firm, Skagerrak Pelgic, are reported to be the most successful companies in Skagen but the town is also home to FF Skagen, the world's top producer of fish meal and fish oil.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the expected increase in cargo traffic, the Port of Miami recently stated that October 2010 was its busiest October ever for cruise vacations. The port had a record 346,513 cruise passengers that October, up 29% from October 2009. This follows a record year in cruise traffic, with 4.15 million cruise passengers in the 12 months that ended in September. This is partially due {{to the arrival of}} new <b>cruise</b> <b>ships</b> such as the Norwegian Epic, as well as the cruise line Costa Cruises. Despite this, the Port of Miami has recently been losing cruise and cargo traffic to nearby Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale. In 2010, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, which is headquartered in Miami, chose Port Everglades as home for its new <b>cruise</b> <b>ships,</b> Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas, currently the largest <b>cruise</b> <b>ships</b> in the world.|$|E

5|$|One {{source of}} income for the area is visiting <b>cruise</b> <b>ships.</b> The Norwegian {{government}} has become concerned in recent years about large numbers of cruise ship passengers suddenly landing at small settlements such as Ny-Ålesund, which is conveniently close to the barren-yet-picturesque Magdalena Fjord. With the increasing size of the larger ships, up to 2000 people can potentially appear in a community that normally numbers less than 40. The government has recently passed legislation, effective from January 2014, severely restricting the size of <b>cruise</b> <b>ships</b> that may visit.|$|E
