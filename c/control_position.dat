5|$|The torpedoes {{initially}} had {{a similar}} system where various rangefinders, especially the fifteen-foot rangefinder above the aft torpedo control tower, and deflection sights provided data to a Dreyer table in the torpedo TS adjacent to the 5.5-inch TS on the lower deck. However the Dreyer table was removed during Hoods 1929–1931 refit and the calculations {{were made in the}} torpedo <b>control</b> <b>position</b> in the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Repulse was recommissioned on 1 January 1921 {{and joined}} the Battlecruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. In November 1923, Hood, {{accompanied}} by Repulse {{and a number of}} s of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron, set out on a world cruise from west to east via the Panama Canal. They returned home ten months later in September 1924. Shortly after her return the ship's pair of 3-inch AA guns and her two single four-inch gun mounts were removed and replaced with four QF four-inch Mark V AA guns. The Battlecruiser Squadron visited Lisbon in February 1925 to participate in the Vasco da Gama celebrations before continuing on the Mediterranean for exercises. A squash court was added on the starboard side between the funnels for the Prince of Wales' tour of Africa and South America that lasted from March to October. Upon her return she was refitted from November 1925 to July 1926 and had a high-angle <b>control</b> <b>position</b> (HACP) added to her fore-top.|$|E
25|$|The {{control point}} {{is the place where}} the {{supervisor}} can best monitor the status of the diver and progress of the dive. For scuba dives this is commonly on deck of the dive boat where there is {{a good view of the}} surface above the operational area, or on the shore at a nearby point where the divers can be seen when surfaced. For surface supplied diving, the view of the water is usually still necessary, and a view of the line tenders handling the umbilicals is also required, unless there is live video feed from the divers and two-way audio communications with the tenders. The <b>control</b> <b>position</b> also includes the gas panel and communications panel, so the supervisor can remain as fully informed as practicable of the status of the divers and their life support systems during the dive. For bell diving and saturation diving the situation is more complex and the <b>control</b> <b>position</b> may well be inside a compartment where the communications, control and monitoring equipment for the bell and life-support systems are set up.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{performance}} envelope boundary cueing for a {{vehicle control system}} comprises the steps of formulating a prediction system for a neural network and training the neural network to predict values of limited parameters {{as a function of}} current <b>control</b> <b>positions</b> and current vehicle operating conditions. The method further comprises the steps of applying the neural network to the control system of the vehicle, where the vehicle has capability for measuring current <b>control</b> <b>positions</b> and current vehicle operating conditions. The neural network generates a map of current <b>control</b> <b>positions</b> and vehicle operating conditions versus the limited parameters in a pre-determined vehicle operating condition. The method estimates critical control deflections from the current <b>control</b> <b>positions</b> required to drive the vehicle to a performance envelope boundary. Finally, the method comprises the steps of communicating the critical control deflection to the vehicle control system; and driving the vehicle control system to provide a tactile cue to an operator of the vehicle as the <b>control</b> <b>positions</b> approach the critical control deflections.

25|$|Since Fort Campbell was decommissioned, it {{has fallen}} {{into a state of}} neglect and disrepair. It still retains most of its {{original}} features, although many rooms are in ruins. The fort was vandalized repeatedly, and in 2004 the fire <b>control</b> <b>position</b> was completely destroyed by vandals. At some point, the iron beams that supported the roof of the barracks were stolen, and due to this some of the blocks have collapsed or are in danger of collapsing.

25|$|Whilst {{retaining}} {{the dimensions of}} the Titan TD7 and Tiger TS11, the 1945 Titan PD1 and Tiger PS1 were entirely new designs featuring a new E181 7.4-litre engine with pushrod valve operation and a brand new four-speed constant mesh gearbox. The export versions with an O prefix for overseas markets, the OPS1, not only had longer wheelbases (where legally applicable) but were equipped with the pre-war design overhead-camshaft E87 engine, which had the same nominal 100bhp output but was larger at 8.6 litres. No UK operator took the OPS1 but Potteries Motor Traction took a batch of long-wheelbase OPD1 Titans as single-deckers, later rebodying them as double decks once overall length rules had been relaxed to allow this. When fitted with left-hand drive, the Tiger became the LOPS1, this prefix attaching to all left-hand drive Leyland buses (and Leyland-designed British United Traction trolleybuses) until the mid-1960s when later designs adopted a suffix letter for driving <b>control</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|The battery was {{initially}} armed with {{four or five}} heavy rifled muzzle loaders for use against large warships. These were replaced in 1895 by more powerful 6-inch rifled breech loaders. In 1905 it was renamed from Grain Battery to Dummy Battery and underwent substantial alterations to its fabric to accommodate {{a new set of}} guns. Two 4.7-inch quick-firing guns were installed {{on the roof of the}} fort to counter smaller and faster adversaries such as torpedo boats and destroyers. They were mounted in a pair of concrete emplacements of a typical low-profile design, with ready-use ammunition recesses adjacent to each gun. The emplacements were linked by a covered way protected by a high parapet wall. A new magazine was also built within the battery's core, with separate storage rooms for shells and cartridges, and a fire <b>control</b> <b>position</b> was added. These alterations resulted in major changes to the form of the terreplein which obliterated many of its original features. A troop shelter also existed behind the main trace of the earthworks.|$|E

To control these guns a temporary High-Angle <b>Control</b> <b>Position</b> was mounted above the torpedo control tower aft.

Between August–October 1916, her forward pair of 4-inch guns were replaced by another 6-inch gun and a QF 4-inch Mk V gun replaced her 3-pounder AA gun. In 1917, her aftmost 4-inch guns were replaced by another pair of 21-inch torpedo mounts. During 1917–18, her pole foremast was replaced by a tripod mast that was fitted with a gunnery director. In November 1918 her AA gun and a pair of 4-inch guns was replaced by a pair of QF [...] 20-cwt AA guns abaft the bridge, where the 4-inch guns had originally been located. An additional 6-inch gun was added abaft the funnels in March–April 1919 in lieu of her last 4-inch guns. Sometime between 1919 and 1924 the ship received a pair of 2-pounder [...] Mk II [...] "pom-pom" [...] guns on single mounts.
