5|$|Water {{temperature}} {{changes of}} more than 1–2°C (1.8–3.6°F) or salinity changes <b>can</b> <b>kill</b> some species of coral.

5|$|A {{large number}} of species of {{families}} Saturniidae, Limacodidae and Megalopygidae have stinging caterpillars which have poisonous setae, also called urticating hairs, {{and in the case}} of Lonomia – a Brazilian saturniid genus – <b>can</b> <b>kill</b> a human due to its potent anticoagulant poison. Caterpillars of many taxa that have sequestered toxic chemicals from host plants or have sharp urticating hair or spines, display aposematic colouration and markings.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the large}} amount of effort focused at {{controlling}} insects, human attempts to kill pests with insecticides can backfire. If used carelessly, the poison <b>can</b> <b>kill</b> all kinds of organisms in the area, including insects' natural predators, such as birds, mice and other insectivores. The effects of DDT's use exemplifies how some insecticides can threaten wildlife beyond intended populations of pest insects.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to following the main storyline, the player character will witness {{and can take}} part in random events they encounter as they explore the game world. These include public hangings, ambushes, pleas for assistance, encounters with strangers, ride-by shootings, and dangerous animal attacks. For example, if {{a group of people}} ride into town firing guns in the air, Marston <b>can</b> <b>kill</b> them, and will receive a bonus of honor and fame for protecting the town. The player character can also take part in optional side activities, most of which give the player money. These side activities include dueling, in which the player character must be a faster draw than their opponent; bounty hunting, where Marston can hunt down bounties on wanted posters; herb collecting, which involves gathering exotic plants from around the game map for town medics; gambling, where people can be found playing games such as poker and Five Finger Fillet; and hunting, in which the player <b>can</b> <b>kill</b> wild animals and skin their hides.|$|E
5|$|In feral sheep, rams may fight {{during the}} rut to {{determine}} which individuals may mate with ewes. Rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams <b>can</b> <b>kill</b> one another if allowed to mix freely. During the rut, even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.|$|E

The NCR then wins the battle and annexes New Vegas and the entire Mojave Wasteland.|$|E
5|$|The adult bobcat has few predators {{other than}} humans, {{although}} it may be killed in interspecific conflict. Cougars and gray wolves <b>can</b> <b>kill</b> adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park. Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) fighting over a carcass is confirmed.|$|E

50|$|A mixture {{containing}} 5% tetraethyl dithiopyrophosphate at {{the concentration of}} 0.5 grams of phosphate per 1000 cubic feet was found in tests in the late 1940s to kill 100% of nonresistant two-spotted spider mites and 68% to 97% of resistant two-spotted spider mites. Tetraethyl dithiopyrophosphate aerosols killed 100% of the populations {{of a large number}} of insects, but only killed 98% of mealybugs in the same tests. 88% of nonresistant spider mites <b>can</b> be <b>killed</b> be two minutes of exposure to a {{mixture containing}} 5% of the chemical, 98% to 99% <b>can</b> be <b>killed</b> after five to ten minutes, and all <b>can</b> be <b>killed</b> after 15 minutes.|$|R

5|$|Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at {{a casino}} to acquire {{information}} about Elektra's attackers; he discovers that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly {{in league with}} Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist, meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones, and enters the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the GPS locator card and weapons-grade plutonium from a nuclear bomb. Before Bond <b>can</b> <b>kill</b> him, Jones blows his cover. Renard drops a hint that he and Elektra are collaborating and flees with the plutonium, while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card.|$|E
5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites is high, at 80–90%, the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing <b>can</b> <b>kill</b> 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than the}} weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E

5|$|An enzyme {{inhibitor}} is a molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity <b>can</b> <b>kill</b> a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are {{enzyme inhibitor}}s. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, {{wind farms}} produce {{renewable}} energy, helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones <b>can</b> <b>kill</b> many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E
5|$|Later, Walt and Jesse {{dispose of}} Victor's body, the gun that killed Gale, {{and the box}} cutter in a barrel of {{hydrofluoric}} acid. During breakfast later, Walt insists to Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: neither <b>can</b> <b>kill</b> the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which have yet to be discovered.|$|E
