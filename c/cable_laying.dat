5|$|Perhaps Simpson's {{most ambitious}} project was the laying of a {{submarine}} cable between Cape York and New Guinea. A <b>cable</b> <b>laying</b> ship, the SS Mernoo, was chartered, and two old cables that {{ran across the}} Bass Strait were lifted and re-laid across the Torres Strait in October 1943. When the land connections were completed in December 1943, it became possible {{to send a message}} all the way from Melbourne to Port Moresby. Simpson, who was on an inspection tour of New Guinea, was on hand for the receipt of the first message. In November 1944, he visited the front in the Netherlands, Belgium and France, returning to Australia via the United States and Canada.|$|E

25|$|From the 1850s {{until well}} into the 20th century, British {{submarine}} cable systems dominated the world system. This was set out as a formal strategic goal, which became known as the All Red Line. In 1896, there were thirty <b>cable</b> <b>laying</b> ships in the world and twenty-four of them were owned by British companies. In 1892, British companies owned and operated two-thirds of the world's cables and by 1923, their share was still 42.7 percent. During World War I, Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.|$|E

60|$|IN the {{beginning}} of the year 1859 my former colleague (the first British University Professor of Engineering), Lewis Gordon, at that time deeply engaged in the then new work of cable making and <b>cable</b> <b>laying,</b> came to Glasgow to see apparatus for testing submarine cables and signalling through them, which I had been preparing for practical use on the first Atlantic cable, and which had actually done service upon it, during the six weeks of its successful working between Valencia and Newfoundland. As soon as he had seen something of what I had in hand, he said to me, 'I would like to show this to a young man of remarkable ability, at present engaged in our works at Birkenhead.' Fleeming Jenkin was accordingly telegraphed for, and appeared next morning in Glasgow. He remained for a week, spending the whole day in my class-room and laboratory, and thus pleasantly began our lifelong acquaintance. I was much struck, not only with his brightness and ability, but with his resolution to understand everything spoken of, to see if possible thoroughly through every difficult question, and (no if about this!) to slur over nothing. I soon found that thoroughness of honesty was as strongly engrained in the scientific as in the moral side of his character.|$|E

50|$|Modern cable ships differ {{greatly from}} their predecessors. There {{are two main}} types of cable ships: cable repair ships and cable-laying ships. Cable repair ships, like the Japanese Tsugaru Maru, tend to be smaller and more maneuverable; {{they are capable of}} <b>laying</b> <b>cable,</b> but their primary job is fixing or {{repairing}} broken sections of cable. A cable-laying ship, like the Long Lines, is designed to <b>lay</b> new <b>cables.</b> Such ships are bigger than repair ships and less maneuverable; their cable storage drums are also larger and are set in parallel so one drum can feed into another, allowing them to <b>lay</b> <b>cable</b> much faster. These ships are also generally equipped with a liner cable engine (LCE) that helps them <b>lay</b> <b>cable</b> quickly.|$|R

50|$|The rising {{demand for}} these fiber-optic cables outpaced the {{capacity}} of providers such as AT&T. Having to shift traffic to satellites resulted in poorer quality signals. To address this issue, AT&T had to improve its <b>cable</b> <b>laying</b> abilities. It invested $100 million in producing two specialized fiber-optic <b>cable</b> <b>laying</b> vessels. These included laboratories in the ships for splicing cable and testing its electrical properties. Such field monitoring is important because the glass of fiber-optic cable is less malleable than the copper cable that had been formerly used. The ships are equipped with thrusters that increase maneuverability. This capability is important because fiber-optic cable must be laid straight from the stern (another factor copper <b>cable</b> <b>laying</b> ships {{did not have to}} contend with).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Offshore Oil & Gas industry, {{shipping}} {{and the ocean}} resource development industries {{play a vital role}} in the development of a country. The harsh marine environment and the need to explore for hydrocarbons in deep and ultra-deep waters has put in place technology and specialized marine support vessels to explore and produce hydrocarbons from below the ocean bed. The specialized vessels engaged in such operations have to maintain a fixed position in relation to a fixed point at the ocean bed despite the harsh vessel position deviating forces of sea currents, waves and wind acting on the floating vessel as little change in the position may lead to accident in the sea. So by the method of “Dynamic Positioning” the vessel is kept stationary in the sea and then oil and gas is extracted by using drilling vessels or drill ships. This method also allows other vessels like crane vessels, shuttle tanker, dredging and rock dumping vessels, pipelay, <b>cable</b> <b>lay</b> and <b>cable</b> repair vessels to remain stationary in sea so that extraction process takes place efficiently...|$|R
