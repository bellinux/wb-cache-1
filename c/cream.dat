For example, one myth tells of Jenny who enticed the giant Blunderbore (sometimes called Moran) by feeding him clotted <b>cream.</b> He {{eventually}} {{fell in love}} with her and made her his fourth wife. Another myth, from Dartmoor, tells of a princess who wanted to marry an elven prince, but according to tradition had to bathe in pure <b>cream</b> first.

40|$|Background. In Cambodia, {{there is}} {{widespread}} use of skin-whitening <b>creams</b> containing levels of mercury that exceed Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) guidelines by up to 35, 000 times. Mercury in skin-whitening <b>creams</b> threatens to compromise the health of Cambodians. Objectives. It is important to provide essential information on sources of mercury so that Cambodians can avoid exposure to elevated levels of mercury and to support informed management of consumer goods. Methods. Students were directed to buy selected skin-whitening <b>creams</b> that were then sampled with replication in 2011 and 2015 and processed with X-ray fluorescence (XRF) at the University of Health Science (UHS), Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Discussion. The analysis of skin-whitening <b>creams</b> in Phnom Penh in 2015 was compared to analyses in 2008 and 2011 and showed that several <b>creams</b> produced in Asia no longer contain mercury. However, skin <b>creams</b> produced in Phnom Penh continue to use mercury and counterfeit products also are contaminated with mercury. Vendors occasionally identified Vietnam {{as a source of}} counterfeit products, but often the source was unknown. Mercury continues to be the metal of greatest concern in skin <b>creams.</b> <b>Creams</b> with more than 1, 000 μg/g of mercury are a common cause of dermatitis (27 % of cases). A new XRF analyzer was also able to detect more lead and arsenic than that used in analyses performed in 2011, and these two metals also exceeded ASEAN guidelines. Arsenic contamination also reflected the presence of bismuth in <b>creams.</b> Conclusion. Some producers of skin-whitening <b>creams</b> in Thailand, China and Taiwan appear {{to be aware of the}} risks of mercury contamination and have modified their products. However, other producers of skin-whitening <b>creams</b> continue to use mercury. XRF analysis allows for rapid screening of mercury in cosmetics and should be used to gather additional information on mercury content in cosmetics in support of public health efforts to stem the import, export and sales of skin <b>creams</b> containing mercury...|$|R

30|$|Majority of the skin-lightening <b>creams</b> {{analysed}} in {{this study}} originated for Cote d’Voire (34  %), Italy (30  %) and India (13  %). The rest originated from UK, USA, Senegal, China, Germany, Nigeria and Ghana. T-mercury concentration (μg/g) in the skin-lightening <b>creams</b> imported from Cote d’Voire ranged from < 0.001 to 0.327  ±  0.062, < 0.001 to 0.250  ±  0.031 in <b>creams</b> imported for Italy and < 0.001 to 0.182  ±  0.057 in <b>creams</b> imported from India. About 28 % of the <b>creams</b> recorded T-mercury concentration below detection (< 0.001  μg/g). The highest concentration of T-mercury was recorded in EG which is imported from Cote d’Voire. T-mercury concentration in soaps ranged from 0.003  ±  0.000 to 0.337  ±  0.073  μg/g. All the skin-lightening <b>creams</b> and soaps analysed had T-mercury concentration below 1.0  μg/g maximum limit set by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) (USFDA 2009). Similar results were reported by Voegborlo et al. (2008). However, previous studies conducted by Al-Saleh and Al-Doush (1997) on mercury concentration in <b>creams</b> obtained from the Saudi Arabians market which originated from Asia and Middle East contained T-mercury concentration above the US FDA limit. Results of T-mercury determined in cosmetic products obtained on Dares Salaam market in Tanzania also showed very high concentration of mercury in some <b>creams</b> and soaps above the US FDA limit with T-mercury ranged from 0.11 to 8665  μg/g in cosmetic soaps and 0.16 – 25.30  μg/g in cosmetic <b>creams</b> (Kinabo 2003).|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} {{social and}} economic importance of ready–made food production, together with the complexity of production technology, processing, handling and acceptance of these fragile and perishable products requires extensive knowledge of their physical properties.

The <b>creams</b> tested were made in the laboratory using specific concentrates as fine powders, marketed by the company “Dr. Oetker” compared with similar <b>creams</b> based on traditional recipes and techniques.

5|$|The {{large scale}} {{production}} of ice <b>cream</b> also {{resulted from the}} ice trade. Ice <b>cream</b> had been produced in small quantities {{since at least the}} 17th century, but this depended both on having large quantities of ice available, and substantial amounts of labour to manufacture it. This was because using ice to freeze ice <b>cream</b> relies both on the application of salt to an ice mixture to produce a cooling effect, and also on constantly agitating the mixture to produce the light texture associated with ice <b>cream.</b> By the 1820s and 1830s, the availability of ice in the cities of the U.S. east coast meant that ice <b>cream</b> was becoming increasingly popular, but still an essentially luxury product. In 1843, however, a new ice <b>cream</b> maker was patented by Nancy Johnson which required far less physical effort and time; similar designs were also produced in England and France. Combined with the growing ice trade, ice <b>cream</b> became much more widely available and consumed in greater quantities. In Britain, Norwegian ice was used by the growing Italian community in London from the 1850s onwards to popularise ice <b>cream</b> with the general public.|$|E

50|$|<b>Creaming</b> is the {{accumulation}} of drops in the dispersed phase {{at the top of}} the container. This occurs as a result of buoyancy forces. The density of the dispersed and continuous phases, as well as the viscosity of the continuous phase, greatly affect the <b>creaming</b> process. If the dispersed phase liquid is less dense than the continuous phase liquid, <b>creaming</b> is more likely to occur. Also, there is a greater chance of <b>creaming</b> at lower viscosities of the continuous phase liquid. Once all of the dispersed drops are in close proximity to each other, it is easier for them to coalesce.|$|R
