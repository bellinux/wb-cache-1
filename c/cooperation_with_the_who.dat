5000|$|Although {{there is}} a lack of {{attention}} to mental health in the healthcare systems, it is a major issue in Southeast African countries. Efforts have been made in some countries to allocate funding to mental health initiatives. Uganda's policies are a prime example of a successful effort to improve mental health in Southeast Africa. In 2006-2007, after undertaking an initial situational analysis of Uganda’s mental health system, a new mental health policy was created. The vision for the project in Uganda is to eliminate, mental health issues, neurological disorders, and substance use from the population. From this vision, guiding principles were implemented, key priority areas were identified, policy objectives were selected, and the Uganda Ministry of Health began to make mental health a priority. The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to work with the developing nations of Africa to implement strategies to improve mental health situations and treatment in these countries. The few countries that have mental health policies in place, were created prior to 1990, and are in dire need of updating. [...] Uganda had achieved great success with their new mental health policies and is working in close <b>cooperation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>WHO</b> to finalize their health-care policy.

The project was limited by only designing the guiding funnels to withstand a single situation of a static load. The calculations assumed that the materials were isotropic and was following a multilinear stress curve in order to define the material as ideal plastic. Three guiding funnels were made whereas only two were valid according to the the requirements. The reliability of the results are discussed and improvements are suggested by potential errors that might have been evident in the calculations.

40|$|The Naval Postgraduate School's (NPS) Space Systems Academic Group is {{developing}} the Petite Amateur Navy Satellite (PANSAT), a small satellite for digital store-and-forward {{communication in the}} amateur frequency band. This thesis describes the design and {{the analysis of the}} communication payload housing of PANSAT. The payload consists of four circuit boards. The main challenge is to provide enough stiffness and minimize electromagnetic interference within the small amount of space determined by other parts surrounding the housing. The design of this particular housing is especially demanding and requires paying {{a lot of attention to}} details. Many factors, including launch loads, board weight, component size, orientation, and mounting must be considered. A particular aspect of this housing is the fact that there are an unusual number of electrical connectors involved in this design. Complicating this issue is the extreme physical constraint imposed by the configuration of the satellite. The structure as well as the boards are analyzed using classical hand calculation methods and more sophisticated methods, using SDRC® I-DEAS design software. In addition, a finite element analyses is performed using the I-DEAS finite element application which allows to model all structures in great detail mathematically. It also permits to examine the behavior of these structures under all possible load conditions, static as well as dynamic. Another important aspect of this design is to guarantee manufacturability. The complexity of this housing makes it mandatory that the design be carried out in close <b>cooperation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> machinist <b>who</b> is responsible for the actual manufacturing of these parts. The analysis results show that the structure of the housing is very robust and most likely will accommodate all the requirements. Unversitaet der Bundeswehr Muenchen, Germany[URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnostics}} of {{the abdominal}} cavity in children, {{especially in the}} neonatal-infantile period, requires knowledge {{in the field of}} anatomical and physiopathological differences as well as clinical symptomatology and pathology at every stage of the child’s development. Errors and mistakes in ultrasound diagnostics of the abdominal cavity in children result from many factors, including lack of experience in examining children and the knowledge concerning most frequent ailments and pathologies as well as the incidence or no changes in the ultrasound image of the abdominal cavity organs. The assessment of the ultrasound image should be always based on clinical data of the patient, information on the past diseases, surgeries and the results of additional examinations and laboratory tests. Particular attention should be paid to the occurrence of congenital diseases and inflammations, which may have varied clinical manifestation – {{especially in the case of}} pediatric diagnostics. The variety and non-specific nature of clinical symptoms may also mask the developing neoplastic process. Mistakes in ultrasound diagnostics, especially among the youngest children, may also be caused by technical difficulties related to carrying out the examination. The above situation results from lack of <b>cooperation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> child, <b>who</b> is uneasy, wailing, fails to perform orders, which may lead to overlooking the existing lesion or overinterpreting, e. g. a full stomach or residual stool in the intestines to be a pathology. It is also of high importance to have a good class of the ultrasound equipment and technical knowledge concerning its operation.

40|$|IMF {{forecasts}} of GDP growth and inflation for program countries are often perceived as overly optimistic {{when compared with}} subsequent out-turns. A review of the relevant literature confirms {{that this is the}} conclusion of a number of studies, but reveals some nuances. In particular, econometric analysis suggests that during the evaluation period, 2002 – 11, the bias was significant only for countries with exceptional access to Fund resources, and that it was generally corrected {{in the course of the}} first program review. Information gathered in interviews and a survey shows that there are several ex ante reasons for any optimistic bias. First, forecasts made in the context of program countries are conditional on the successful implementation of policy measures specified in the program itself. This implies that the forecasts may turn out to be optimistic because the conditions in the program were not all fulfilled. Second, these forecasts are produced in <b>cooperation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> country authorities <b>who,</b> according to some officials interviewed by the evaluation team, typically tend to present a more benign picture to gain popular support for the program.

40|$|Malignant tumours of {{the upper}} gum and hard palate account for 1 - 5 % of {{malignant}} neoplasms of the oral cavity; {{two thirds of the}} lesions which involve these areas are squamous cell carcinomas. Most of these carcinomas are diagnosed late, when they invade the underlying bone. The procedures of choice for removal are: alveolectomy, palatectomy, maxillectomy, which may be total or partial. Surgical reconstruction of the defect may be carried out using a wide range of microvascularized flaps: osteomuscolocutaneous of the internal iliac crest, an osteocutaneous flap of the fibula or scapula, fascia, or osteocutaneous radial flap, or a pedicled flap of temporal muscle. These flaps are supported by single or multiple obturator prostheses. Rehabilitation via palatal obturators is preferred in patients with a poor prognosis or in weak condition. Rehabilitation aims to: restore the separation between the oral and nasal cavities, enable the patient to swallow, maintain or provide mastication, sufficient occlusion and mandibular support, support the soft facial tissues, re-establish speech and restore an aesthetically pleasing smile. Hence, it is crucial to work in close <b>cooperation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> staff <b>who</b> makes <b>the</b> prosthesis and <b>who</b> evaluates <b>the</b> case when the surgery is planned and obtains the necessary gnatological, anatomical and functional information.

Analytically the project addresses the Communication plan written by the EU Commission in <b>cooperation</b> <b>with</b> thirteen ngo’s and two biographies concerning FGC in the light of discourse analysis. It seeks to analyze <b>who</b> has <b>the</b> power to define the practice, how different meanings are applied to the term, and how they are ratified. In addition, the aim is to examine the background behind the cultural tradition and assess the possibility of a patronizing eurocentric view on the issue and societies that practice it, performed largely by the organizations and commissions designed to support them. Conclusively the project shows a variety of positions according to FGC, placed in two main perspectives: a widely anthropological view and a widely feminist view, although both views present themselves within the field of Gender Studies. The first is concerned for the risk of Western meddling in African societies and proclaims the other to be enforcing unwanted cultural imperialism, the other for the risk of neglecting a responsibility towards those in need, proclaiming the other to condone a cultural relativism that will allow male oppression to prevail. The project reveals FGC as a complex issue than can’t be understood or resolved solely from a Western or essentialist feminist perspective, it emphasizes the importance of unbiased cultural research from a nuanced perspective, and intense <b>cooperation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> African societies <b>who</b> still practice FGC...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{long term}} experience, {{collected}} mainly with military applications like Rail Guns and Active Armour, {{a range of}} optimized semiconductor devices for pulsed applications was developed by ABB Switzerland Ltd and described in this presentation. The presented devices are optimized for pulsed discharge and fit very well for switching the short but high electrical power demand used for magnetic forming. Devices are available in different versions with silicon wafer diameters up to 120 mm and blocking voltages of over 6500 V. Because of the different application requirements a differentiation is made in device technology. Depending on the discharge circuit, devices for low, medium, or high di/dt can be selected and the difference in advantages and disadvantages between both technologies will be described. To minimize the inductance between switching device and freewheeling diode, ABB can integrate this diode monolithic on the switching wafer. These so called reverse conducting devices are very common for magnetic forming applications. Thyristor structures are commercially available up to 8500 V with 120 mm silicon wafers and GTO-like structures are available up to 4500 V with 91 mm silicon wafers. For higher voltages or higher currents a combination of devices in series and/or parallel connection is required. The presentation will also describe the evolution of complete discharge switching modules {{in the range of}} 10 kV / 50 kJ, a large discharge system of 21 kV / 200 kA, and a newly designed high current switch in the range of 15 kV / 3 MJ.

For reliability reasons it is of great importance that the switch assemblies for high current pulsed applications are designed in <b>cooperation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> device manufacturer <b>who</b> has in-depth knowledge of the switching behavior of the semiconductor components under pulsed conditions.

40|$|As {{the water}} and {{wastewater}} network in Europe is declining, the recommendation is to move towards Asset Management, as this is a proactive approach to system rehabilitation. This thesis has been written at LNEC, Portugal, in <b>cooperation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> AWARE-P team, <b>who</b> is developing a software to deal with future planning of rehabilitation of the network. The work has been to collect the need of data in their modules, looking at data collected from other rehabilitation softwares and comparing it to what is available in Gemini VA to value the use of Gemini VA for rehabilitation planning support. Planning tools for rehabilitation of water and wastewater networks {{is still in the}} developing phase. The programs are often data hungry, and collecting data is time demanding. Gemini VA represent a good software for collecting base data used in rehabilitation planning, and is the most used water and wastewater maintenance software in Norway. It's important to identify the limits and possibilities of the software for future development, and the goal of this thesis has been to look into improvements of the software to give better data at a lower time cost. In the Asset Management approach the condition of the network must first be decided. This analysis can be done with basic data such as material, construction year, dimension and condition factor from surveys done on the network (CCTV etc). When the condition is determined, assessments within cost, performance and risk can be completed at the strategic, tactical and operational level. Gemini VA can provide a lot of base data, but even though the data is available, the preparations is time demanding, and the only data validation feature available, is a material-dimension-construction yearvalidation. Therefore historical data, {{and the rest of the}} structural data, must be validated manually. Gemini VA should try to move towards an Asset Managment approach by including more validation reports, pre made statistical reports, and visualisation effects of the statistics. The software should also include cost, more information on stormwater assets, water quality tests and more pumpingstation and treatment plant information. Gemini VA can be used to collect data for a national statistical database for utilities with low or poor record of historical data to retrieve statistical numbers for planning (failure rate for different materials, etc) ...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands {{gastroenteritis}} {{belongs to}} <b>the</b> ten diseases <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest incidence rates. A sentinel {{study on the}} incidence of gastrointestinal complaints and the occurrence of the investigated pathogens (Campylobacter, Salmonella and Shigella) {{was carried out in}} about 40 general practices in 1992 and 1993. The sentinel stations were as representative as possible of the Dutch population. The study was undertaken by the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection (RIVM) and the Netherlands Institute of Primary Health Care (NIVEL) in <b>cooperation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> general practitioners <b>who</b> participated in <b>the</b> Dutch Sentinel Practice Network and 24 laboratories. Age and sex of patients <b>who</b> met <b>the</b> case definition were reported to the NIVEL. These patients were asked by their GP to provide a stool sample and to complete a questionnaire. The number of patients that were either reported to the NIVEL or have been given a questionnaire by their GP was estimated at about 2370. A completed questionnaire was received from 58. 9 % (1400 / 2370) of these patients. Eighty percent (1400 / 1744) of the cases completed the questionnaire they received. Results of microbiological analysis were obtained for 89. 1 % (1248 / 1400) of patients <b>who</b> completed <b>the</b> questionnaire. The crude incidence rate of acute gastrointestinal complaints was 55. 3 per 10, 000 person years, after correction for non response it was 89. 9 per 10, 000 person years. The incidence was lower in 1993 than in 1992. Between men and women no differences have been found. The highest incidences have been found in the agegroups under five. The incidence rate for Campylobacter was 6. 9 per 10, 000 person years (182 samples positive), for Salmonella 2. 2 (55 samples positive) and for Shigella 0. 4 per 10, 000 person years (10 samples positive). After correction for non response these incidences were 11. 7 and 3. 5 and 0. 6 per 10, 000 person years. The Salmonella incidence rate was higher in 1993 than in 1992 and higher in men than in women. The highest incidence rates for Campylobacter and Salmonella were found in the agegroups under five. The (late) summer months as expected, showed the highest incidence rates. Incidence rates for gastroenteritis as well as for microorganisms were lower than incidences found in other sentinels. To follow trends in incidence rates and microorganisms it is necessary to undertake sentinels repeatedly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same methodology and population. However results cannot be generalised to the general population and consequently it remains necessary to carry out a population cohort study every 5 to 10 years...|$|R
