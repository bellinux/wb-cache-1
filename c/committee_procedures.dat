40|$|By what means can {{legislative}} committees exercise {{influence on}} policy outputs? How {{and why do}} committees in different countries differ in their abilities to do so? This dissertation argues that legislative committee power is a multidimensional concept. <b>Committee</b> <b>procedures</b> can be distinguished into three analytic dimensions: 1) committees' positive agenda power, their power to ensure the placement of legislative versions preferred by them on the floor; 2) committees' negative agenda power, their power to delay or block the progress of legislation; and 3) committees' information capacity, institutional incentives granted to them to gather and transmit information. These distinct dimensions benefit different legislative actors. Therefore, they reflect different features of a political system, {{and may not be}} consistently strong or week. Based on an original cross-national data set, the dissertation shows that <b>committee</b> <b>procedures</b> cluster empirically in these three distinct dimensions. Furthermore, the dissertation also demonstrates how legislators' electoral incentives, the composition of multiparty governments, preexisting authoritarian incumbents' uncertainty and bargaining power, and the changes in legislative memberships affect different dimensions of committee power.

The mediating factors that influenced the developmental processes included the participants and their perceptions, their decisions and factors influencing their decisions. The Curriculum and Instruction Advisory Committee of the Texas Learning Technology Group was selected as the subject of this study which used qualitative data collection methods. Data collection included participant observation of curriculum meetings followed by structured interviews of the participants. Document analyses were triangulated with the observations and interviews to ascertain influences on decision-making processes.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{recommend}} policies that promote representative government, political scientists and politicians must understand how {{changes to the}} current political environment affect political behavior. This dissertation analyzes how both opinion and policies affect political behavior {{in the context of}} voting, campaign competition, and committees. Rational models of political behavior are used to formulate hypotheses of political behavior and action. Testing models of political behavior the author employs a wealth of methodological knowledge and expertise in national surveys, survey experiments, laboratory experiments, computer simulations, and regression analysis. Results indicate that rational models of political behavior can be used to develop accurate hypotheses of political behavior. The conclusion of the second and third chapters is that voter opinions about the integrity of the election process are significantly affected by decisions at the election administration level and the outcome of elections. In laboratory experiments involving multimember committees results show that <b>committee</b> <b>procedures</b> similar to Roberts' Rules of Order reveal information held by biased, privately informed experts. Additionally, information aggregation is higher in multimember committees with heterogeneous preferences when <b>committee</b> <b>procedures</b> allow for the formation of an expert's reputation. The fifth chapter presents empirical results that suggest individual campaign contributions are positively and significantly affected by a candidate's association with specific types of social organizations. Finally, the sixth chapter presents results that show back-loaded primary calendars are more likely to lead to greater interparty competition and more extreme general election candidates...|$|E
