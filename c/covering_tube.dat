JAERI and Kyoto University have been developing sup 1 sup 9 sup 2 Ir radiation sources by the cooperative research project entitled as 'The research on safety and effectiveness of the intravascular brachytherapy for preventing restenosis of the coronary artery disease' since 1998. The radiation source was introduced into the stenosis through a catheter (a guide-tube to insert directly into vascular) to irradiate the diseased part. Ten sup 1 sup 9 sup 2 Ir seed sources (phi 0. 4 mm x 2. 5 mm) were positioned between nylon spacers (phi 0. 3 mm x 1. 0 mm) in a flexible <b>covering</b> <b>tube</b> and the tube was plugged with a core-wire; the tube was shrunk to fix the inside materials and the size is 0. 46 mm in diameter and 3 m in length.

The production method of the radiation source, which is practical to use in the clinics was also established...|$|E
40|$|Author offers and {{researches}} a {{new idea}} - filling tubes by electronic gases. He shows: If the insulating envelope (cover) of the tube is charged positively, the electrons within the tube are not attracted to <b>covering.</b> <b>Tube</b> (as a whole) remains a neutral (uncharged) body. The electron gas in the tube has very low density and very high conductivity, close to superconductivity. If we take the density (pressure) of electron gas as equal to atmospheric pressure, the thickness of insulator film may be very small and the resulting tube is very light. Author shows the offered tubes {{can be applied to}} many technical fields. For example: (1) Transfer of energy over very long distance with very small electric losses. (2) Design of cheap high altitude electric lines without masts. (3) Transfer of energy from one continent to another continent through the ionosphere.

40|$|International audienceStable {{carbon and}} {{nitrogen}} isotopic composition (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) of benthic organisms was investigated {{to understand the}} effects of a gregarious tubicolous amphipod species (Haploops nirae) on benthic food web structures and test whether drastic changes in species composition cause changes in food web structure. The habitat engineered by this species was sampled and compared with the adjacent uncolonized Amphiura filiformis muddy habitat in winter and summer. The isotopic signatures of macrofaunal and megafaunal species associated with both habitats were analysed along with potential food sources at each sampling period. Similar food web structures for each habitat (and each season), with high δ 15 N ranges spanning over 3 trophic levels, were reported although omnivory was less frequent in the H. nirae habitat. The amphipod H. nirae appears to play a baseline role, with the lowest δ 15 N values and δ 13 C values indicating that it primarily feeds on phytoplankton. Bayesian mixing models were used to estimate the contributions of potential food sources to the diet of the species accounting for most of the biomass in each habitat and showed that the epibionts <b>covering</b> <b>tube</b> mats are a key contribution to the food webs of both habitats. Identified as benthic diatoms, they may minimize interspecific food competition between dominant suspension feeders such as Polititapes virgineus or H. nirae within a habitat. This finding highlights the contribution of microphytobenthic producers to subtidal (~ 30 m deep) muddy habitat food webs, suggesting that the mucopolysaccharides composing the H. nirae tubes support the growth of a heterotrophic diatom population. As an engineer species, H. nirae acts as a facilitator for diatoms which ultimately sustain the secondary production of the H. nirae habitat as well as the immediate surrounding habitats...|$|E

40|$|Mycophilic fungi of {{anamorphic}} genus Sepedonium (telomorphs in Hypomyces, Hypocreales, Ascomycota) infect and parasitize sporomata of boletes. The obligated hosts such as Boletus edulis {{and allied}} species (known as “porcini mushrooms”) {{are among the}} most valued and prized edible wild mushrooms in the world. Sepedonium infections have a great morphological variability: at the initial state, contaminated mushrooms present a white coating <b>covering</b> <b>tubes</b> and pores; at the final state Sepedonium forms a deep and thick hyphal layer that eventually leads to the total necrosis of the host. Up to date, Sepedonium infections in porcini mushrooms have been evaluated only through macroscopic and microscopic visual analysis. In this study, in order to implement the infection evaluation as a routine methodology for industrial purposes, the potential application of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for detection of Sepedonium presence on sliced and dried Boletus edulis and allied species was investigated. Hyperspectral images were obtained using a pushbroom line-scanning HSI instrument, operating in the wavelength range between 400 – 1000 nm with 5 nm resolution. PCA was applied on normal and contaminated samples. To reduce the spectral variability caused by factors unrelated to Sepedonium infection, such as scattering effects and differences in sample height, different spectral pre-treatments were applied. A supervised rule was then developed to assign spectra recorded on new test samples to each of the two classes, based on the PC scores. This allowed to visualize directly – within false-color images of test samples – which points of the samples were contaminated. The results achieved may lead {{to the development of a}} non-destructive monitoring system for a rapid on-line screening of contaminated mushrooms...|$|R

50|$|The {{difficulties}} of the Cornish boiler were that a boiler of any particular power would require a known area of furnace tube as the heating area.

Increasing the tube diameter reduced the depth of water <b>covering</b> the furnace <b>tube</b> and so increased the need for accurate control of water level by the fireman, or else the risk of boiler explosion.

Given that social behaviour is particularly full of uncertainty, we developed a version of the task where the outcome was still unpredictable yet obviously controlled by an experimenter.

While 4 -year-olds demonstrated competence, chimpanzees and the younger children instead tended to cover only one exit.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) is an {{established}} method {{that can be}} used in order to cover for soft tissue defects. This study focuses on the use of a modified suction machine in the form of an aquarium pump as an economical substitute for the VAC dressing. The improvised suction apparatus was a regular aquarium pump, which was altered in order to draw air in instead of expelling it. The patients were followed-up for a period of three weeks in the wards. METHODS: VAC was applied over the soft tissue defects. Sterilized foam was used and attached to a French 16 suction tube. A tight seal was ensured using a sterile adhesive <b>covering.</b> The <b>tube</b> was then attached to the modified vacuum machine, which maintained the negative pressure. CASE STUDIES: Three cases are presented in this study. The first and second cases involved pediatric patients who sustained degloving injuries of the foot. The third case involved a 23 year-old male who sustained an open patellar fracture due to a motorcycle accident. The dressing was changed every five days and the progress was documented using photographs. The patients were placed on VAC dressing for a period of two weeks. On the 14 th day, good granulation was evident on the soft tissue defects hence; the patients were scheduled and subsequently underwent splitthickness skin grafting. DISCUSSION: The modified suction pump is an effective and economical alternative to the VAC machine for the purpose of providing constant negative pressure to promote tissue granulation and healing for large tissue defects. However, in order to establish the efficacy of the proposed intervention, the modified suction pump should be tested on more cases...|$|R

RESULTS: There was no occurrence of graft melting or tube exposure, although porcine pericardium was associated with greater inflammation through clinical observation. Light microscopy revealed marked inflammation surrounding the porcine pericardium with foreign body granuloma formation.
