40|$|From the Oxford Haemophilia Centre, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, England When Okamoto and his {{associates}} began their systematic search in 1947 for a synthetic inhibitor of fibrinolysis they aimed to find a substance of value in clinical conditions in which hyperplasminaemia was significant-conditions such as excessive bleeding associated with prostatic and thoracic surgery and with abruptio placentae. They discovered two potent inhibitors of fibrinolysis, epsilon-amino-caproic acid (EACA) l and tranexamic acid (amino-methyl-cyclohexane carboxylic acid) (AMCA). 2 Both drugs have been used with mixed success {{in a variety of}} clinical conditions during the past 20 years. I shall confine myself to their use in treating haemophilia (factor VIII deficiency) or <b>Christmas</b> disease (<b>factor</b> IX deficiency). A third inhibitor of fibrinolysis, aprotinin (Trasylol), prepared from bovine lung is also commercially available. In addition to acting as an inhibitor of plasmin and plasminogen activator it has a weak anticoagulant action. It has been very little used in haemophilia except as an instillation into joints during some forms of joint surgery and will not be discussed. Epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) Okamoto and {{his associates}} thought that EACA acted by inhibiting plasmin, but Alkjaersig et al. 3 showed that it was principally a competitive inhi-bitor of plasminogen activator and acted in this respect in vivo at a concentration of 0 - 1 mmol/l.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{hemophilia}} B (<b>Christmas</b> disease; <b>factor</b> IX deficiency) results from many different mutations in the factor IX gene, of which greater than 95 % are single nucleotide substitutions. This study has identified a previously unreported form of hemophilia B in a patient who was a somatic mosaic for a guanine-to-cytosine transversion at nucleotide 31, 170 in the factor IX gene. This point mutation changes the codon for residue 350 in the catalytic domain of factor IX from a cysteine to a serine. We used differential termination of primer extension to confirm and measure the degree of mosaicism. Our study shows that a varying proportion of cells from hepatic, renal, smooth muscle, and hematopoietic populations possessed normal as well as mutant factor IX sequences.

In addition, this kindred also contains two females in successive generations who have moderately severe factor IX deficiency. The molecular pathogenesis of this latter phenomenon has been studied and seems to relate to the unaccompanied expression of the mutant factor IX gene consequent upon a second, as yet undefined, genetic event that has prevented inactivation of sequences including the mutant factor IX gene on the X chromosome inherited from the affected male...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - An {{important}} part of the Christmas ritual is the request tradition. Parents ask their children what they would like for Christmas, respond to a child's request or often initiate such Christmas communication exchanges. These styles of family communication relate to the socialization of children into consumption and Christmas. This exploratory study aims to consider aspects of parental approaches to their children's request behavior within the Family Communication Patterns (FCP) typology. Design/methodology/approach - Data were gathered via a survey of parents in the period prior to <b>Christmas</b> supported the <b>factor</b> structure of the FCP typology via Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Findings - It appears that parents encourage a positive exchange of desire and opinion from children; they also question the sources of information and suitability of the gift. In this manner, parents appear to condone, if not generate, an atmosphere of open request behavior because the limiting of gift requests through direct parental instruction is minimal. Practical implications - Continual adaptation of the FCP typology from the original context has implications for consumer behavior theory at a factor analysis level. Parental responses to Christmas request behavior are an important topic of interest to consumer behavior researchers, the toy industry, retailers and business in general. Originality/value - This research explores contemporary issues of parental interactions with their children during the gift request ritual. It is timely to explore theory related to this topic because much of the rhetoric around Christmas accentuates the pester power syndrome. Yet, Christmas symbolizes love, family and nurture where parental values engender request behavior and children's desires generate the requests. The findings have consequences for consumer advocates and social commentators, as well as providing cultural and ritual interpretations within parent-child interactions.

40|$|I T HAS BEEN {{apparent}} {{from its inception}} that the thromboplastin generation test 1 ’ 2 {{is more complicated than}} the simple interaction, in the presence of calcium, of three factors whose names are given to the reactants of the test: platelets, antihemophilic factor and <b>Christmas</b> <b>factor</b> (plasma thromboplastin component, PTC). The platelet reactant contributes at least two factors active in this test: a protein-linked phospholipid, and accelerator globulin (AcG), the latter probably having been adsorbed from plasma. The antihemophilic factor, supplied as aluminum hydroxide- or barium sulfate-adsorbed plasma, is accompanied by at least three other factors: accelerator globulin (AcG), plasma thromboplastin antecedent (PTA) 3 and Hageman factor. ’ It may also contain inhibitors. The <b>Christmas</b> <b>factor</b> (PTC), supplied as diluted serum, is accompanied by PTA, Stuart factor, 5 Hageman factor, antithrombin, antithromboplastin and variable amounts of prothrombin. These complexities severely limit the interpretation and understanding of the reactions that are taking place. We wish to describe a system for the assay of certain coagulation factors which replaces the complex reagents of the thromboplastin generation test with purified * fractions, the concentrations of which can be controlled. We have found that plasma thromboplastin antecedent must be incorporated in the thromboplastin generation system, and this requirement established a laboratory assay for this factor that is not dependent on the use of PTA-deficient plasma. have employed this same test system for the semi-quantitative assay of each of its components...|$|E
40|$|In {{the theory}} of blood {{coagulation}} proposed by Biggs (1955) it is supposed that blood thrombo-plastin is produced by the interaction of anti-haemophilic globulin, <b>Christmas</b> <b>factor,</b> platelet lipoid factor, factor VII, factor V, and calcium. Russell viper venom (R. V. V.) {{can act as a}} thromboplastin, i. e., convert prothrombin to thrombin, only after combination with platelet lipoid factor and factor V (Rapaport, Aas, and Owren, 1954 a). The action of R. V. V. would, therefore, appear to resemble that of a mixture of antihaemophilic globulin, <b>Christmas</b> <b>factor,</b> and factor VII, and the observation of Owren (1954) that R. V. V. gives normal one-stage prothrombin times with samples of plasma deficient in these sub-stances supports this hypothesis. The experiments described in this paper were undertaken to obtain more direct evidence of the relation of R. V. V. to the substances developed during coagulation. The thromboplastin generation test devised by Biggs and Douglas (1953), which enables the contribu-tions of the clotting factors in plasma, in serum, and in platelets to be assessed separately, was used for this purpose. By introducing R. V. V. in place of the ordinary constituents of the test, the relative efficacy of R. V. V. and the thromboplastin ante-cedents found in the human blood has been deter-mined. In addition, the effect of plasma lipoid on the coagulant action of. R. V. V. (Macfarlane, Trevan, and Attwood, 1941; Fullerton and Anastasopoulos, 1949) and the effect of adsorption of R. V.

40|$|Vitamin E is an {{essential}} vitamin and a lipid soluble antioxidant, at least, under in vitro conditions. The antioxidant properties of vitamin E are exerted through its phenolic hydroxyl group, which donates hydrogen to peroxyl radicals, resulting {{in the formation of}} stable lipid species. Beside an antioxidant role, important cell signalling properties of vitamin E have been described. By using gene chip technology we have identified alpha-tocopherol sensitive molecular targets in vivo including <b>christmas</b> <b>factor</b> (involved in the blood coagulation) and 5 alpha-steroid reductase type 1 (catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone) being upregulated and gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl synthetase (the rate limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis) being downregulated due to alpha-tocopherol deficiency. Alpha-tocopherol regulates signal transduction cascades not only at the mRNA but also at the miRNA level since miRNA 122 a (involved in lipid metabolism) and miRNA 125 b (involved in inflammation) are downregulated by alpha-tocopherol.

40|$|There is much {{evidence}} favoring {{the concept of}} coagulation as a continuous process in the normal subject. In order {{to learn more about}} the dy-namics of this process, we have been studying the survival of physiological amounts of the various clotting factors in the normal subject. With the development of isotope labeling, it has for the first time become possible to carry out such stud-ies. We (1 - 3) and others (1 - 10) have applied this technique to studies of platelet and fibrinogen turnover. These studies were possible because both platelets and fibrinogen are present in large amounts and can be separated in relatively pure form. Isotope techniques have not yet been ap-plied to a study of the other proteins involved in coagulation because they are present in relatively trace amounts and cannot yet be isolated in suffi-ciently pure form. In order to overcome these problems, we have developed a technique of in vivo labeling, sepa-rating, and counting two of the clotting proteins, Factor VIII (antihemophilic globulin) as an ex-ample of a protein consumed during coagulation and Factor IX (plasma thromboplastin compo-nent, <b>Christmas</b> <b>factor)</b> as an example of a clot-ting protein not consumed during coagulation.

40|$|A {{persistent}} puzzle in {{our understanding}} of hemostasis has been the absence of hemorrhagic symptoms in the majority of patients with Hageman trait, the hereditary deficiency of Hageman factor (factor XII). One proposed hypothesis is that alternative mechanisms exist in blood through which plasma thromboplastin antecedent (PTA, factor XI) can become active in the absence of Hageman factor. In order to test this hypothesis, the effect of several proteolytic enzymes, among them thrombin, plasma kallikrein, and trypsin, was tested upon unactivated PTA. PTA was prepared from normal human plasma by Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 adsorption, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and successive chromatography on QAE-Sephadex (twice). Sephadex-G 150, and SP-Sephadex. The partially purified PTA was almost all in its native form, with a specific activity of 45 - 70 U/mg protein; the yield was about 10 %. It contained no measurable amounts of other known clotting factors, plasmin, plasminogen, nor IgG. Incubation of PTA with trypsin generated potent clot-promoting activity that corrected the abnormally long clotting time of plasma deficient in Hageman factor or PTA but not in <b>Christmas</b> <b>factor.</b> This clot-promoting agent behaved like activated PTA on gel filtration (apparent molecular weight: 185, 000) and was specifically inhibited by an antiserum directed against activated PTA.

Whether trypsin serves to activate PTA in vivo is not yet clear...|$|E
40|$|T H E Ehlers-Danlos {{syndrome}} {{features a}} particular type of bleeding tendency associated with haematomata following minor trauma, gaping wounds and prolonged bleeding following laceration, and tissue repair in the form of papyra-ceous scars. The inherited defect has been thought to be embodied in an excess of elastic fibres and virtual absence of collagen fibres in the skin as shown both histologically and on electron microscopy (Tunbridge, 1957). However, Lisker et al. (1960) have reported the association of deficiency of Factor IX (<b>Christmas</b> <b>factor)</b> and the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in a mother and daughter, casting doubt on the statement that bleeding in the syndrome is always the result of vascular defects. That this association does not hold for every example of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome has already been shown by Day and Zarafanetis (1961), who found no coagulation abnormality apart from a mild prothrombin deficiency in one of their four subjects. They concluded that the predisposition of these subjects to form large haematomata following trauma is not due to coagulation factors. The results of coagulation and capillary resistance studies in a further two cases of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are reported in this communication. MATERIAL A brother and sister, aged 50 years and 55 years respectively, had presented the cardinal manifestations of the syndrome since birth—namely, hyperelasticity and abnormal fragility of the skin as demonstrated by hyperextensible skin, fre-quent subcutaneous haematomata with much swelling, and gaping wounds requiring suture following laceration, no matter how small. Papyraceous scars were present, but there was minimal joint hypermobility. Similar abnormalities were said to have occurred in their grandfather and were present in the son of one of them.

40|$|Human Factor IX (<b>Christmas</b> <b>factor)</b> is a {{single-chain}} plasma glycoprotein (mol wt 57, 000) that {{participates in}} the middle phase of the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. It is present in plasma as a zymogen and is converted to a serine protease, Factor IXabeta, by Factor XIa (activated plasma thromboplastin antecedent) {{in the presence of}} calcium ions. In the activation reaction, two internal peptide bonds are hydrolyzed in Factor IX. These cleavages occur at a specific arginyl-alanine peptide bond and a specific arginyl-valine peptide bond. This results in the release of an activation peptide (mol wt approximately equal to 11, 000) from the internal region of the precursor molecule and the generation of Factor IXabeta (mol wt approximately equal to 46, 000). Factor IXabeta is composed of a light chain (mol wt approximately equal to 18, 000) and a heavy chain (mol wt approximately equal to 28, 000), and these chains are held together by a disulfide bond(s). The light chain originates from the amino terminal portion of the precursor molecule and has an amino terminal sequence of Tyr-Asn-Ser-Gly-Lys. The heavy chain originates from the carboxyl terminal region of the precursor molecule and contains an amino terminal sequence of Val-Val-Gly-Gly-Glu. The heavy chain of Factor IXabeta also contains the active site sequence of Phe-Cys-Ala-Gly-Phe-His-Glu-Gly-Arg-Asp-Ser-Cys-Gln-Gly-Asp-SER-Gly-Gly-Pro. The active site serine residue is shown in capital letters. Factor IX is also converted to Factor IXaalpha by a protease from Russell's viper venom. This activation reaction, however, occurs in a single step and involves only the cleavage of the internal arginyl-valine peptide bond. Human Factor IXabeta was inhibited by human antithrombin III by the formation of a one-to-one complex of enzyme and inhibitor. In this reaction, the inhibitor was tightly bound to the heavy chain of the enzyme. These data indicate that the mechanism of activation of human Factor IX and its inhibition by antithrombin III is essentially identical to that previously shown for bovine Factor IX...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of bleeding in haemorrhagic thrombocythaemia is obscure. Although by definition {{there is always}} a raised platelet count, the haemorrhagic episodes cannot be satisfactorily correlated with the level of the count. In fact, thrombocythaemia can exist without bleeding manifestations (Fanger, Cella, and Litchman, 1954). The most commonly occurring laboratory defect is an abnormal bleeding time, this being increased in approximately 50 % of cases (Hardisty and Wolff, 1955). The introduction of the thromboplastin generation test by Biggs and Douglas in 1953 provided a valuable method of investigation, and has been applied in many of the reported cases of haemorrhagic thrombo-cythaemia. Attention has, however, been focused mainly on the platelets, and the results have varied considerably. This paper presents details of a case of haemorrhagic thrombocythaemia showing a <b>Christmas</b> <b>factor</b> deficiency. Methods Blood Counts. -In this laboratory three were performed as described by Dacie (1950). Clotting Mechanism. -Tests of clotting were as described by Biggs and MacFarlane (1957). In the one-stage prothrombin test (Quick) a saline emulsion prepared from a stock of acetone-dried human brain powder, selected to give a normal clotting time of 12 ± 1 sec., was used. The thromboplastin generation tests were based on the method of Biggs and Douglas (1953), the collection of blood being in accordance with Biggs and MacFarlane (1957). The only modification was that clotting was observed on slides on a specially constructed thermostatically-controlled warm stage, which enabled the moment of clotting to be gauged accurately. Absorption by Al(OH) 3. -Platelet-rich normal plasma was centrifuged and the supernatant removed so as to increase the platelet concentration 10 times. The platelets were resuspended and the plasma incubated for three hours. After re-centrifuging, the supernatant was removed and treated with AI(OH) 3. This plasma and the same plasma before platelet concentration were compared against known Christmas disease serum in the thromboplastin generation tests. There {{was no significant difference in}} the curves produced...|$|E
40|$|A cDNA library {{prepared}} {{from human}} liver has been screened for factor IX (<b>Christmas</b> <b>factor),</b> a clotting factor that {{participates in the}} middle phase of blood coagulation. The library was screened with a single-stranded DNA prepared from enriched mRNA for baboon factor IX and a synthetic oligonucleotide mixture. A plasmid was identified that contained a cDNA insert of 1, 466 base pairs coding for human factor IX. The insert is flanked by G-C tails of 11 and 18 base pairs at the 5 ' and 3 ' ends, respectively. It also included 138 base pairs that code for an amino-terminal leader sequence, 1, 248 base pairs that code for the mature protein, a stop codon, and 48 base pairs of noncoding sequence at the 3 ' end. The leader sequence contains 46 amino acid residues, and it is proposed that this sequence includes both a signal sequence and a pro sequence for the mature protein that circulates in plasma. The 1, 248 base pairs code for a polypeptide chain composed of 416 amino acids. The amino-terminal region for this protein contains 12 glutamic acid residues that are converted to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid in the mature protein. These glutamic acid residues are coded for by both GAA and GAG. The arginyl peptide bonds that are cleaved in the conversion of human factor IX to factor IXa by factor XIa were identified as Arg 145 -Ala 146 and Arg 180 -Val 181. The cleavage of these two internal peptide bonds results {{in the formation of}} an activation peptide (35 amino acids) and factor IXa, a serine protease composed of a light chain (145 amino acids) and a heavy chain (236 amino acids), and these two chains are held together by a disulfide bond(s). The active site residues including histidine, aspartate, and serine are located in the heavy chain at positions 221, 270, and 366, respectively. These amino acids are homologous with His 57, Asp 102, and Ser 195 in the active site of chymotrypsin. Two potential carbohydrate binding sites (Asn-X-Thr) were identified in the activation peptide, and these were located at Asn 157 and Asn 167. The homology in the amino acid sequence between human and bovine factor IX was found to be 83 %...|$|E
