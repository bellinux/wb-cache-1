However, as half of the patients fail {{to respond to the}} treatment, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate circulating <b>CLL</b> <b>cell</b> depletion and clinical response according to the context of complement activation and FcγRIIIA polymorphism in ten CLL patients with relapsed/refractory disease. At the end of the treatment, results indicated that circulating CD 5 (+) CD 19 (+) <b>CLL</b> <b>cell</b> depletion was major (50 % decrease) in 4 of 10 patients and ineffective for the two other patients. No clinical modifications were observed following ofatumumab introduction. Ofatumumab administration leads to a rapid and important exhaustion of complement C 4 levels in patients with initial lymphocytosis. C 4 exhaustion was accelerated in a non-responder patient, and incomplete in two patients with partial circulating depletion. Moreover, delaying weekly to monthly ofatumumab injections improved <b>CLL</b> <b>cell</b> depletion in two patients. FcγRIIIA 158 polymorphism (FF n = 6 and VF n = 4) was not associated with major and/or partial circulating <b>CLL</b> <b>cell</b> depletion.

40|$|Recently, we {{detected}} that chronic {{lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL) B-cell–derived microvesicles in CLL plasma carry a constitutively phosphorylated novel receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), Axl, indicating that Axl was acquired from the leukemic B cells. To examine Axl status in CLL, we determined the expression of phosphorylated-Axl (P-Axl) in freshly isolated <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells</b> by Western blot analysis. We detected differential levels of P-Axl in <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells,</b> and further analysis showed that expression of P-Axl was correlated with the other constitutively phosphorylated kinases, including Lyn, phosphoinositide- 3 kinase, SyK/ζ-associated protein of 70 kDa, phospholipase C γ 2 in <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells.</b> We found that these intracellular signaling molecules were complexed with P-Axl in primary <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells.</b> When Axl and Src kinases were targeted by a Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, bosutinib (SKI- 606), or a specific-inhibitor of Axl (R 428), robust induction of CLL B-cell apoptosis was observed in both a dose- and time-dependent manner.

50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of CLL {{is based on}} the demonstration of an abnormal population of B lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow, or tissues that display an unusual but characteristic pattern of molecules on the cell surface.

In addition, all the <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> within one individual are clonal, that is, genetically identical. In practice, this is inferred by the detection of only one of the mutually exclusive antibody light chains, kappa or lambda, on the entire population of the abnormal B cells.

The DHR2 domain of Dock10 appears to bind to the small G proteins Cdc42, TC10 and TCL although these interactions are of low affinity.

In this study, we analyzed gene expression modifications in <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells</b> after treatment with valproic acid (VPA), a well-tolerated anti-epileptic drug with HDAC inhibitory activity. <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells</b> obtained from 14 patients were treated in vitro with a concentration of 1 mM VPA for 4 h.

Furthermore, VPA significantly increased chemosensitivity to fludarabine, flavopiridol, bortezomib, thalidomide and lenalidomide. VPA inhibited the proliferation of CpG/IL 2 -stimulated <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells</b> and modulated many cell cycle messenger RNAs.

In addition, the <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> of patients having lymphadenopathy (LApos) show a survival advantage during TEM that {{can be linked to}} increased expression of α 4 and αL integrin chains. Within this context, ephrinA 4 expressed on the surface of <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> sequestrates integrins and inactivates them resulting in reduced adhesion and inhibition of apoptotic/survival signals through them. In agreement, ephrinA 4 silencing resulted in increased survival of <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> of LApos patients but not LA neg patients.

In the present study, we show that expression of S 1 P 1, the S 1 P receptor responsible for lymphocyte egress, is selectively reduced in <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells</b> with unmutated IGHV. Expression of S 1 P 2, which controls B-cell homeostasis, is also impaired in <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells</b> but independently of the IGHV mutational status.

The effect(s) of BAFF or APRIL on leukemia cell survival appeared additive and distinct from that of stromal cell–derived factor- 1 α (SDF- 1 α), which in contrast to BAFF or APRIL induced leukemia cell phosphorylation of p 44 / 42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase- 1 / 2 [ERK 1 / 2]) and AKT. Conversely, BAFF and APRIL, but not SDF- 1 α, induced CLL-cell activation of the nuclear factor–κB 1 (NF-κB 1) and enhanced CLL-cell expression of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl- 1. However, BAFF, but not APRIL, also induced CLL-cell activation of NF-κB 2. We conclude that BAFF and APRIL from NLCs can function in a paracrine manner to support leukemia cell survival via mechanisms that are distinct from those of SDF- 1 α, indicating that NLCs use multiple distinct pathways to support CLL-cell survival...|$|R

Despite previously reported functional differences between CD 5 negative and CD 5 positive B cells, TGF-β induced apoptosis in both, CD 5 negative and CD 5 positive populations, to a similar extent. Both CD 5 positive and CD 5 negative B cells from aged NZB mice were resistant to the anti-apoptotic effects of IL- 4, in contrast to B cells from aged BALB/c mice. Thus, the hypothesis that CD 5 expression determines the apoptotic response to cytokines was tested and rejected by the data presented in this dissertation. These data demonstrate an aberrant response of <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells</b> to cytokine regulation by TGF-β, IL- 4, IFN-γ and IL- 5 which may contribute to the relative expansion of this B cell clone.

40|$|The {{biological}} and clinical relationship between Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) and Monoclonal B-cell Lymphocytosis (MBL) {{has now been}} reported in some detail. This review investigates associations between biology and disease activity {{as they relate to}} the absolute numbers of abnormal cells. The clonal B-cells in CLL-type MBL are indistinguishable from CLL with respect to surface phenotype and the presence of chromosomal abnormalities. However, the majority of CLL-type MBL cases in the general population have very low numbers of clonal B-cells, typically in the range 0. 1 - 10 per μL, and such cases use different IGHV genes than higher-count CLL-type MBL cases and often show intraclonal heterogeneity. Cases with higher counts are biologically similar to CLL although there is a relationship between the <b>CLL</b> <b>cell</b> count at presentation and the likelihood of further clonal expansion. Individuals presenting with <b>CLL</b> <b>cell</b> counts above 2, 000 per μL {{are more likely to have}} gradually increasing B-cell counts over time and although the risk of requiring treatment for progressive CLL remains low there may be impaired normal B-cell activity. © 2010 International Clinical Cytometry Society.

40|$|Chemokines {{and their}} ligands play a {{critical}} role in enabling chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (<b>CLL)</b> <b>cells</b> access to protective microenvironmental niches within tissues, ultimately resulting in chemoresistance and relapse: disruption of these signaling pathways has become a novel therapeutic approach in CLL. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib inhibits migration of several cell lines from solid-organ tumours, but effects on <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> have not been reported. We studied the effect of clinically achievable concentrations of dasatinib on signaling induced by the chemokine CXCL 12 through its ’ receptor CXCR 4, which is highly expressed on <b>CLL</b> <b>cells.</b> Dasatinib pre-treatment inhibited Akt and ERK phosphorylation in <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> upon stimulation with CXCL 12. Dasatinib also significantly diminished the rapid increase in actin polymerisation observed in <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> following CXCL 12 stimulation. Moreover, the drug significantly inhibited chemotaxis in a transwell assay, and reduced the percentage of cells able to migrate beneath a CXCL 12 -expressing murine stromal cell line. Dasatinib also abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of prolonged CXCL 12 stimulation on cultured <b>CLL</b> <b>cells.</b> These data suggest that dasatinib, akin to other small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, may redistribute <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> from protective tissue niches to the peripheral blood, and support the investigation of dasatinib in combination strategies...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) {{is a disease}} of CD 5 + B lymphocytes (designated as <b>CLL</b> <b>cells)</b> that are inefficient antigen-presenting cells. Their poor ability to present antigens to the T cells, largely due to an inadequate costimulatory capacity, is manifested as a failure to stimulate proliferation of both allogeneic and autologous T cells. We have investigated the ability of in vitro manipulated <b>CLL</b> <b>cells,</b> via hyperexpression of a triad of costimulatory molecules (B 7 - 1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM- 1], and leukocyte-function–associated antigen 3 [LFA- 3], designated TRICOM), to stimulate effective antitumor T-cell responses. A recombinant modified vaccinia virus strain Ankara (MVA), which is a highly attenuated, replication-impaired virus variant, was successfully used to infect and deliver the simultaneous expression of the 3 human costimulatory molecules in TRICOM {{on the surface of}} the <b>CLL</b> <b>cells.</b> Proliferation of allogeneic and autologous T cells was observed when MVA-TRICOM–infected <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> were used as stimulators in proliferation assays. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, generated in vitro by stimulation of autologous T cells with MVA-TRICOM–infected <b>CLL</b> <b>cells,</b> showed cytotoxicity against unmodified/uninfected <b>CLL</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, our findings suggest that the use of <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> infected ex vivo with MVA-TRICOM or direct injection of MVA-TRICOM in patients with CLL has potential for the immunotherapy of CLL...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) {{is the most}} common adult leukemia, and resistance to fludarabine-based therapies is a major challenge in CLL treatment. Because <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> are known to have elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we aimed to test a novel ROS-mediated strategy to eliminate fludarabine-resistant <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> based on this redox alteration. Using primary <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> and normal lymphocytes from patients (n = 58) and healthy subjects (n = 12), we showed that both fludarabine-resistant and -sensitive <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> were highly sensitive to β-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) with mean IC 50 values of 5. 4 μM and 5. 1 μM, respectively. Normal lymphocytes were significantly less sensitive to PEITC (IC 50 = 27 μM, P <. 001). <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited intrinsically higher ROS level and lower cellular glutathione, which were shown to be the critical determinants of CLL sensitivity to PEITC. Exposure of <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> to PEITC induced severe glutathione depletion, ROS accumulation, and oxidation of mitochondrial cardiolipin leading to massive cell death. Such ROS stress also caused deglutathionylation of MCL 1, followed by a rapid degradation of this cell survival molecule. Our study demonstrated that the natural compound PEITC is effective in eliminating fludarabine-resistant <b>CLL</b> <b>cells</b> through a redox-mediated mechanism with low toxicity to normal lymphocytes, and warrants further clinical evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Cell surface {{expression}} of CD 150 and CD 180 receptors in {{chronic lymphocytic leukemia}} (CLL) associates with mutational IGHV status and favourable prognosis. Here we show a direct correlation between cell surface expression and colocalization of these receptors on <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells.</b> In the absence of CD 150 and CD 180 on the cell surface both receptors were expressed in the cytoplasm. The CD 150 receptor was colocalized with markers of the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus and early endosomes. In contrast, CD 180 was detected preferentially in early endosomes. Analysis of CD 150 isoforms differential expression revealed that regardless of CD 150 cell surface expression the mCD 150 isoform with two ITSM signaling motifs was a predominant CD 150 isoform in <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells.</b> The majority of CLL cases had significantly elevated expression level of the soluble sCD 150, moreover <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells</b> secrete this isoform. CD 150 or CD 180 crosslinking on <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells</b> alone led to activation of Akt, mTORC 1, ERK 1 / 2, p 38 MAPK and JNK 1 / 2 networks. Both CD 150 and CD 180 target the translation machinery through mTOR independent as well as mTOR dependent pathways. Moreover, both these receptors transmit pro-survival signals via Akt-mediated inhibition of GSK 3 β and FOXO 1 /FOXO 3 a. Unexpectedly, coligation CD 150 and CD 180 receptors on <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells</b> led to mutual inhibition of the Akt and MAPK pathways. While CD 150 and CD 180 coligation resulted in reduced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK 1 / 2, c-Jun, RSK, p 70 S 6 K, S 6 RP, and 4 E-BP; it led to complete blocking of mTOR and p 38 MAPK phosphorylation. At the same time coligation of CD 150 and CD 40 receptors {{did not result in}} Akt and MAPK inhibition. This suggests that combination of signals via CD 150 and CD 180 leads to blocking of pro-survival pathways that may be a restraining factor for neoplastic <b>CLL</b> B <b>cells</b> propagation in more than 50 % of CLL cases where these receptors are coexpressed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukaemia (CLL), {{lipoprotein lipase}} (LPL) mRNA overexpression is an established poor prognostic marker, its function, however, is poorly understood. Measuring extracellular LPL enzymatic activity and protein, we found no difference between levels in CLL patients and those of controls, {{both before and after}} heparin treatment in vivo and in vitro. Investigating LPL knock down effects, we determined five potential downstream targets, of which one gene, STXBP 3, reportedly is involved in fatty acid metabolism. While possibly reflecting an epigenetic switch towards an incorrect transcriptional program, LPL overexpression by itself does not appear to significantly influence <b>CLL</b> <b>cell</b> survival...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukaemia (CLL) is {{the most}} common adult leukaemia and, in some patients, is accompanied by resistance to both chemotherapeutics and immunotherapeutics. In this review we will discuss the role of tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) in promoting <b>CLL</b> <b>cell</b> survival and resistance to immunotherapeutics. In addition, we will discuss mechanisms by which TAMs suppress T-cell mediated antitumour responses. Thus, targeting macrophages could be used to i) reduce the leukaemic burden via the induction of T-cell-mediated antitumour responses, ii) to reduce pro-survival signalling and enhance response to conventional chemotherapeutics or iii) enhance the response to therapeutic antibodies in current clinical use...|$|R
