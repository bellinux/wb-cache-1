5|$|California has {{experienced}} less possessory land claim litigation than other states. This is primarily {{the result of}} the Land <b>Claims</b> Act of 1851 (following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo) that required all <b>claims</b> deriving from the Spanish and Mexican governments to be filed within two years. Three U.S. Supreme Court decisions and one Ninth Circuit ruling have held that the Land <b>Claims</b> Act applied to aboriginal title, and thus extinguished all aboriginal title in the state (as no tribes filed <b>claims</b> under the Act). Two Deputy Attorneys General of California have advocated this view.|$|E
