5|$|Ludvig Borga did {{not return}} to the WWF after his ankle healed, so there was no <b>closure</b> <b>to</b> his feud with Tatanka. The feud between Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow was also soon forgotten. In the summer of 1994, both wrestlers joined Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. The two {{eventually}} formed a tag team and unsuccessfully challenged for the WWF Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring <b>closure</b> <b>to</b> an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule {{must be in the}} s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to enter this conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{response}} to Billie was mixed; some critics {{felt that she}} was a strong addition to Charmed while others cited Cuoco's acting and the character's story arc with Christy as signs of the show's declining quality. After speculation about Billie's possible appearance in a spin-off series, it was confirmed all future plans for the show were canceled following The WB's <b>closure</b> <b>to</b> launch The CW. Cuoco later said that she prefer working on sitcoms over dramatic television shows due to demanding shooting schedule that she experienced while working on Charmed.|$|E

5|$|In August 2006 the Jerusalem District Court upheld three earlier {{arbitration}} rulings {{and ordered}} Karta to pay Akirov NIS 100 million for project delays. Akirov resumed construction {{and opened the}} mall in stages from 2007 to 2008, bringing <b>closure</b> <b>to</b> a 37-year project that normally should have taken five to ten years. The 194-room Alrov Mamilla Jerusalem Hotel, anchored {{on the north side}} of the mall, opened in June 2009.|$|E
5|$|In Lee County, {{crews were}} {{deployed}} to collect plant debris. Due to storm damage, officials in Hernando County provided curbside debris removal, and two parks were closed. The post office in Cedar Key was damaged severely enough to remain closed for repairs until February, while the city hall {{has yet to}} reopen. In the meantime, city business has been conducted in a double-wide trailer near the city hall. In Franklin County, the St. George Island Bridge was reopened just 15hours after its <b>closure</b> <b>to</b> allow access to cleanup crews.|$|E
5|$|Radstock had {{a second}} railway station on the Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway {{extension}} to Bath, which closed to passengers in 1966. The stations were {{adjacent to each other}} in the centre of the town, and each had level crossings across the busy A367 road, causing long tailbacks at busy periods. The S line also carried substantial coal traffic. A spur from the Great Western line on to the S and continuing to Writhlington Colliery remained open for a few years after the railway's <b>closure</b> <b>to</b> passenger traffic, until the colliery closed in 1973.|$|E

5|$|The finale's {{narrative}} brings <b>closure</b> <b>to</b> {{several prominent}} story arcs created during Davies' tenure as show runner. In the episode, contemporary Earth and twenty-six other planets are stolen by the Daleks, aided by their megalomaniacal creator Davros and a shattered but precognitive Dalek Caan. As the Doctor (David Tennant) and his companion Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) {{try to find}} Earth, his previous companions Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), and Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) convene to contact him and mount a defence against the Daleks. In the episode's climax, the Doctor is shot by a Dalek and begins to regenerate.|$|E
5|$|Though cyclizations {{following}} the general template above had been observed prior to Nazarov's involvement, {{it was his}} study of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones that marked the first major examination of this process. Nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring <b>closure</b> <b>to</b> the cyclopentenone product. The reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone.|$|E
5|$|Howe was {{determined}} that the pipeline not be delayed, and proposed that the government advance money to the pipeline company to ensure construction in 1956. He emotionally pleaded with his Cabinet colleagues, who agreed both to the proposal and {{to the use of}} rarely used <b>closure</b> <b>to</b> limit the debate. Closure had not been applied in the House since 1932. The issue was attractive to the Tories and CCF with an election due within two years; it would allow them to portray Howe as an arrogant dictator, and play to those citizens who disliked the American involvement in the pipeline project. If the bill did not receive Royal Assent by 7 June 1956, options that Trans-Canada held for steel pipe would expire.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{extend the}} {{flattening}} transformation, which turns nested into flat data parallelism, {{to the full}} higher-order case, including lambda abstractions and data parallel arrays of functions. Our central observation is that flattening needs <b>to</b> transform the <b>closures</b> used <b>to</b> represent functional values. Thus, we use closure conversion before flattening and introduce array <b>closures</b> <b>to</b> represent arrays of functional values. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1999, Ove Arup and Partners {{engineering}} {{undertook a}} feasibility study for a bridge downstream from the Monnow bridge, but the scheme was not progressed at that time. Both the County and Town Councils remained {{committed to the}} construction of a new crossing to support the economic development of the town, and in 2003 local authority funding of £1.3M was secured and construction commenced. The new bridge opened on 15 March 2004 for local traffic, allowing the old bridge to become pedestrianised. The <b>closure</b> <b>to</b> traffic also enabled a significant repair programme to be undertaken, in part funded by the Welsh Government and the European Union. After further conservation and repair, the gatehouse was formally re-opened in 2014, allowing public access on one day per week.|$|E
5|$|Stocks off {{the eastern}} United States are {{severely}} overfished; a 2006 stock assessment {{survey by the}} U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) showed that its population had dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. In 1997, the dusky shark {{was identified as a}} Species of Concern by the NMFS, meaning that it warranted conservation concern but there was insufficient information for listing on the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Commercial and recreational retention of dusky sharks was prohibited in 1998, but this has been of limited effectiveness due to high bycatch mortality on multi-species gear. In addition, some 2,000 dusky sharks were caught by recreational fishers in 2003 despite the ban. In 2005, North Carolina implemented a time/area <b>closure</b> <b>to</b> reduce the impact of recreational fishing. To aid conservation efforts, molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed that can identify whether marketed shark parts (e.g. fins) are from prohibited species like the dusky shark, versus similar allowed species such as the sandbar shark.|$|E
5|$|The line {{operated}} successfully and settlements of people {{attracted to the}} area {{by the prospect of}} employment in the mines grew around the Brendon ridge. However changes in the availability of imported ore made the mines a less attractive proposition and by 1883 the mines were closed and mineral traffic on the railway ceased. In 1879 the railway announced that the wages of all staff would be reduced. The passenger service continued until 7 November 1898; a brief resumption took place from 1907 (but not west of Brendon Hill) until final <b>closure</b> <b>to</b> passengers in 1910. The 1895 Bradshaw Railway Guide shows two return trips every day, at 09:15 and 15:10 from Watchet, calling at Washford, Roadwater and Comberow, taking 30 minutes; return trains were at 10:45 and 16:15, also taking 30 minutes.|$|E
