BPA exposure significantly increased beta-hCG secretion and caspase- 3 expression in placental explants at an environmentally relevant concentration of 1 nM. In the transport studies, a rapid transfer of BPA was observed across the term placentae and the BeWo cell monolayer. Further, transdermal transport of BPA was observed.
