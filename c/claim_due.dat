50|$|This {{practice}} {{seemed to}} work for many years until the 1980s when health <b>claims</b> <b>due</b> to asbestos and environmental damage started to emerge. It quickly became apparent to many Lloyd's syndicates that their predecessors had dramatically underestimated future claims, causing them significant losses.|$|R

Opponents say that the radiation doses are much higher than <b>claimed</b> <b>due</b> {{to the way the}} radiation is measured.|$|R
50|$|The Circuit Court {{also found}} that the {{district}} court was wrong in granting summary judgement for Kremer on the ACPA <b>claim</b> <b>due</b> {{to the fact that the}} court did not notify Bosley that it would rule on this claim and in turn did not provide them a chance to conduct discovery on the issue.|$|E
50|$|FInally, {{some of the}} {{advantages}} of tachographs apply primarily to drivers who can rely upon the support of a trade union. Any assistance that tachographs provide to a driver engaged in a dispute with an employer may not be as useful if the driver cannot settle the <b>claim</b> <b>due</b> to a lack of trade union support, or due to other non-technical obstacles.|$|E
50|$|Baker v. Dorfman, 239 F.3d 415 (2d Cir. 2000). Affirmed the {{district}} court judgment awarding the plaintiff damages for legal malpractice and fraud against his lawyer.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Objective: To analyse the {{personal}} and occupational factors associated with the prevalence and duration of sickness benefit <b>claims</b> <b>due</b> to synovitis and tenosynovitis (CID 10 M 65). Methods: Cross-sectional study regarding sickness benefit <b>claims</b> <b>due</b> to synovitis and tenosynovitis granted to employees by National Institute of Social Security in Brazil in 2008. Data on economic activity (Economic Activities National Classification – CNAE division, class), sex, age, type and duration of benefits were collected from the Unified Benefit System. The study’s population consists of the average monthly employment contracts declared to the National Register of Social Information. Results: In 2008, 35, 601 employees were granted sickness benefits due to synovitis and tenosynovitis, with a prevalence of 10. 9 / 10, 000 employments. Sicknes...|$|R

50|$|In 2000, Myers {{earned a}} salary of US$6,916,667.00 while unable to pitch due to a damaged shoulder. Most of his 1999 and 2000 seasons were spent {{receiving}} treatment after undergoing rotator cuff surgery in 1999; his injury resulted in a legal dispute between the Padres and their insurance carrier after the carrier denied an $8 million <b>claim</b> <b>due</b> to Myers' inability to play.|$|E
50|$|Proponents for {{a second}} Gotthard Road Tunnel bore refer to the Seelisberg Tunnel, which they <b>claim,</b> <b>due</b> to split traffic, results in not only {{smoother}} traffic, but blocked traffic only on one side {{in the case of}} an accident inside the tunnel. However, opponents of the second Gotthard Road Tunnel have indicated that such measure would severely hinder the strategy of the transfer of marchandise from road to rail.|$|E
5000|$|While Dipendra lived, Gyanendra {{maintained}} that the deaths {{were the result of}} an [...] "accidental discharge of an automatic weapon". However, he later said that he made this <b>claim</b> <b>due</b> to [...] "legal and constitutional hurdles", since under the constitution, and by tradition, Dipendra could not have been charged with murder had he survived. A full investigation took place, and Crown Prince Dipendra was found to be responsible for the killing.|$|E
50|$|A report {{considered}} the Olivier and Creighton meta-analysis claims that helmet use {{is associated with}} odds reductions of 51% for head injury, 69% for serious head injury, 33% for face injury and 65% for fatal head injury, it reported 'When examined in detail, all {{were found to be}} unreliable <b>claims</b> <b>due</b> to weaknesses of the supporting evidence and methodology'.|$|R
50|$|Callus made {{a return}} in 2009 at the Aus trials, despite {{clocking}} thunderous {{times in the}} prelims and semi-finals, he failed to beat the younger generation of sprinters in Eamon Sullivan & Matthew Abood.

50|$|If {{conscientious}} objector status is <b>claimed</b> <b>due</b> to religious or ideological reasons, the objector may serve either an alternative military or civil service, {{depending on the}} circumstances of each case. Enlisting had been optional {{for members of the}} Armenian, Maronite, and Roman Catholic minorities, but as of 2008 service was made compulsory for them as well.|$|R
50|$|Powell criticized {{at length}} the Court's {{interference}} with the operation of schools. He argued that minors should be and are treated differently under the law and that the Court was turning its back on precedent. Powell concluded that the majority's decision would allow students to <b>claim</b> <b>due</b> process violations when they were excluded from extracurricular activities, failed from a course, promoted, required to take certain subjects, transferred from one school to another, or bused to a distant school.|$|E
5000|$|The {{employee}} may {{be unable}} to bring a <b>claim</b> <b>due</b> to illegality, but the employer will probably come off worst from such allegations. For example, the employee may have no right to work or may be not paying the right tax - the first person to be fined for that will be the employer, and the publicity of hiring illegal workers or implication in tax scams may be scant reward for trying to kill off a small claim.|$|E
5000|$|Listecki was {{publicly}} {{criticized in}} February 2010 by Jerry Matysik, the Eau Claire Police Chief and SNAP for allegedly misleading the Wisconsin State Legislature about the LaCrosse diocese abuse notification procedure in Listecki's testimony against extending {{the statute of}} limitations, stating,"Archbishop Listecki appears more interested in protecting the organization than he is in protecting children," [...] and again in August 2010 by SNAP for passing up action on an abuse <b>claim</b> <b>due</b> to lack of evidence.|$|E
50|$|Kenna {{was one of}} {{the largest}} cattle {{shipping}} points in the state by 1909. At the peak of its development, the town could boast a bank, two hotels, several stores, a post office, as well as several saloons. By 1912, many homesteaders relinquished their <b>claims</b> <b>due</b> to the drought, and Kenna dropped both in size and importance.|$|R
5000|$|Among several claims, Melaleuca Inc. {{claimed that}} Hansen {{violated}} the [...] "CAN-SPAM" [...] Act by emailing Melaleuca executives {{and trying to}} induce them to leave the company.

5000|$|In recent years, {{some people}} have {{suggested}} links between autism and transgender people. This issue has not been without controversy, as the issue is open to confusion; does the correlation exist, as some <b>claim,</b> <b>due</b> to an innate characteristic of autism that may also cause unusual discrepancies in sex or gender? Or is it, as others claim, merely the result of exposing {{a group of people}} who experience difficulty in abiding by social norms, including those related to gender, to sexism and gender stereotypes? ...|$|E
50|$|However, {{many critics}} dispute whether this method {{was the most}} reliable. The most cited example was O'Donnell's {{complete}} acceptance of Albert Speer's claim to have tried to assassinate Hitler. While many professional historians dispute this <b>claim</b> <b>due</b> to lack of evidence, O'Donnell wrote about it unquestioningly. It is arguable that, if one compares the accounts written in The Bunker with those in Inside the Third Reich, that O'Donnell presents the supposed assassination attempt as more dramatic and purposeful. Admittedly, O'Donnell befriended Speer, and interviewed him 17 times for the book, {{more than any other}} witness.|$|E
50|$|On February 25, 2006, Valero set a {{new world}} record by winning his first 18 fights as a {{professional}} by first-round knockout, breaking Arthur Susskind's historic record set in 1905. That record has since been broken by Tyrone Brunson, but most boxing experts do not acknowledge Brunson's <b>claim</b> <b>due</b> to the extremely poor level of opposition he faced while making {{his way to the}} record; in contrast to Valero's opponents, just one of Brunson's 19 opponents had a winning record, and 6 had failed to win a single fight in their careers.|$|E

50|$|Ives first {{exhibited}} such {{an image}} in 1901, {{at which time}} he stated that the basic concept had occurred to him about sixteen years earlier while working with line screens for the halftone process. In 1904, Auguste Berthier came forward to <b>claim</b> <b>due</b> credit for the first publication of this concept. He had included it {{near the end of}} an 1896 article about large-format stereoscopic images. Berthier had also created an extremely coarse and nonfunctional interlaced image for purposes of illustration, but he never reduced the idea to practice or attempted to patent it.|$|E
50|$|An LVMH {{spokeswoman}} {{interviewed by}} New York Magazine said that Louis Vuitton {{were forced to}} take legal action when Plesner {{did not respond to}} their original request to remove the contested image, nor to the subsequent Cease and desist order. In October 2008, Louis Vuitton declared that the company had dropped its lawsuit but have since reopened it along with a new €205,000 <b>claim</b> <b>due</b> to a painting by the same artist. In May 2011, the court in The Hague found in favour of Plesner's right to freedom of expression.|$|E
50|$|Harriman {{seeks to}} avoid {{government}} {{ownership of the}} Moon. As it passes directly overhead only in a narrow band {{north and south of}} the equator, he uses a legal principle that states that property rights extend to infinity above a land parcel. On that basis, Mexico, Central and parts of South America, and other countries in those latitudes around the world, have a claim on the Moon. The United States also has a <b>claim</b> <b>due</b> to Florida and Texas. By arranging for many countries to assert their rights Harriman persuades the United Nations to, as a compromise, assign management of the Moon to his company.|$|E
50|$|Typically, a large {{variety of}} aqueous {{solutions}} {{can be used}} in place of plain water. This battery type is specifically designed to pollute less (see environmentally friendly <b>claims)</b> <b>due</b> to the lesser use or the absence of heavy metals. Water-activated batteries have been used in radiosondes that shouldn't contain heavy metals since they regularly fall to the ground or ocean surface, and indefinitely remain there.|$|R
