40|$|BACKGROUND: To secure pH homeostasis, {{the central}} {{respiratory}} network must permanently adapt its rhythmic motor drive to environment and behaviour. In neonates, {{it is commonly}} admitted that the retrotrapezoid/parafacial respiratory group of neurons of the ventral medulla plays the primary role in the respiratory response to acidosis, although the serotonergic system may also contribute to this response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using en bloc medullary preparations from neonatal mice, we have shown {{for the first time}} that the respiratory response to acidosis is abolished after pre-treatment with the serotonin-transporter blocker fluoxetine (<b>25</b> - <b>50</b> µM, <b>20</b> min), a commonly used antidepressant. Using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunohistology, we have also shown the expression of the serotonin transporter mRNA and serotonin-containing neurons in the vicinity of the RTN/pFRG of neonatal mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal that the serotonergic system plays a pivotal role in pH homeostasis. Although obtained in vitro in neonatal mice, they suggest that drugs targeting the serotonergic system should be used with caution in infants, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers...|$|R

40|$|Sediments offer {{microorganisms}} an unexplored {{numbers of}} niches {{with the opportunity}} to evolve specialized microbial communities. The small size of microbial niches in biogeochemical gradients in sediments called for a high resolution study of the populations. We applied a genetic fingerprint method, the terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP), to characterize the diversity of the 16 S rRNA gene present in thin sediment layers at which one TRF represents one operational taxonomic unit (OTU). A partial gene amplification and restriction enzyme digestion of the amplicon allows the detection of about 150 different fragments in an intensity range of 100 to 10000 relative fluorescence units as a picture of the richness and evenness of the bacterial community. The T-RFLP method was established for intertidal soft sediments from the Wadden Sea, the North Sea. The variations in the results were correlated to variations in individual steps of the method protocol. Restriction enzyme digest and digest analysis on a capillary sequencer correlated with a dissimilarity of about 20 % and 10 % in the obtained replicate datasets describing one pooled amplicon from one DNA sample after binning with a fixed window size of 0. 5 and 1 base pair, respectively. The biases in individual PCR reactions did not increase the dissimilarity after performing independent T-RFLP analyses from one DNA sample. The dissimilarity was partly caused by an imperfect binning. Working with a high resolution window size of 0. 5 bp, no starting point (<b>50.</b> <b>25,</b> <b>50.</b> <b>20,</b> <b>50.</b> 30 and 50. 65 bp) gave a perfect binning result. Some of identical TRFs were always binned into two different TRFs, thus creating an additional OTU. A window size of 1 bp with starting point 50. 50 bp gave similar dissimilarities. Although our results may require an improved binning technique to utilize the full biodiversity information in the profiles, the current T-RFLP technique clearly detected the biological variation in adjacent small sediment layers and can be used to characterize the microbial community in individual sediment layers. Eukaryotes offer and create a number of niches. The lugworm Arenicola marina is a bioturbator in marine intertidal sediments. The T-RFLP method was applied to investigate the bacterial community in the burrow of the lugworm A. marina. The U-shaped burrow is divided into three compartments: the vertical head shaft tube through which the surface sediment is sinking down and ingested by the lugworm, the horizontal gallery tube at where the lugworm relatively stays permanent inside the sediment and the vertical tail shaft tube through which the lugworm does defecation by moving backward until the tail reaches sediment surface and ejects characteristic fecal cast on the sediment surface. In the bulk sediment surrounding the U-shaped burrow, the sediment contained a number of different bacterial communities changing with depth. On the basis of an aerobic layer, a redox potential discontinuity (RDP) layer and an anoxic layer, the decreasing and the increasing TRFs over depth may represent surface and subsurface layer bacteria respectively at 0 - 2 cm and 2 - 10 cm depth. T-RFLP data suggested that the RDP layer is at 3 - 5 cm sediment depth, because the unique TRFs of the surface layer and subsurface layers were not found at this depth and the change of abundance of TRFs was fast. The T-RFLP analyses clearly grouped the microbial population in the head shaft tube with sediment surface populations. The tail shaft tube was populated by different populations; close to the surface dominated by the surface bacteria and below 3 cm dominated by the subsurface bacteria. The populations in the gallery tube were similar to those in the head and tail shaft tube. The richness in the gallery tube was the lowest but had the highest evenness. T-RFLP analyses of two mm-thick sediment layers from areas with A. marina and without A. marina also revealed a strong depth-dependence of the surface bacterial community composition. According to the T-RFLP analyses, {{the presence or absence of}} A. marina had no clear detectable influence on the microbial populations in the top two centimeter of sediment. Most likely, the increase presence of other burrowing animals in the A. marina exclusion areas seems to form highly similar biogeochemical environments for the development of bacterial communities...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: While {{most of the}} {{sequence}} of myosin’s motor domain is highly conserved among various organisms and tissue types, the junctions between the <b>25</b> and <b>50</b> kDa domains and the <b>50</b> and <b>20</b> kDa domains are strikingly divergent. The <b>50</b> - <b>20</b> K loop is positioned to interact with actin, while the <b>25</b> - <b>50</b> K loop is situated nearer the ATP binding site [Rayment, I., et al. (1993) Science 261, 50 - 58]. Chimeric studies of the <b>50</b> - <b>20</b> K loop [Uyeda, T. Q. -P., et al. (1994) Nature 368, 567 - 569; Rovner, A. S., et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270 (51), 30260 - 30263] have shown that this loop affects actin activation of ATPase activity. Given the function of myosin as a molecular motor, it was proposed that the <b>25</b> - <b>50</b> K loop might specifically alter ADP release [Spudich, J. A. (1994) Nature 374, 515 - 518]. Here we study the role of this loop by engineering chimeras containing the Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain with loops from two enzymatically diverse myosins, rabbit skeletal and Acanthamoeba. The chimeric myosins complement the myosin null phenotype in vivo, bind nucleotide normally, interact normally with actin, and display wild-type levels of actin-activated ATPase activity. However, the rate of ADP release from the myosins, normally the slowest step involved in motility, was changed {{in a manner that}} reflects the activity of the donor myosin. In summary, studies of Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain chimeras have shown that the <b>50</b> - <b>20</b> K sequence specifically affects the actin-activated ATPase activity [Uyeda, T.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the hypotheses that milk yield and behaviour at milking after relocation are impacted by gestation and lactation stages. Forty-one Holstein cows were relocated from the tie-stall barn with pipeline milking system into the barn with free-stall housing and herringbone milking parlour. Milk yield and order at the milking were recorded electronically. A significant decrease in daily milk yield was detected immediately after relocation (the first day) compared with the last day before treatment (23. 76 ± 7. 21 kg vs 30. 97 ± 7. 26 kg; P< 0. 001). However, the performance drop did not last long; after fourteen days milk production exceeded the mean original level (32. 16 ± 8. 87 kg). No significant differences were found in the comparison of cows according to gestation stages. Cows in the second and first stages of lactation showed the highest declines in milk yield on the first day (36. 77 ± 6. 34 kg and 33. 76 ± 7. 44 kg vs 28. 14 ± 7. 00 kg and <b>25.</b> <b>50</b> ± 8. <b>20</b> kg; P< 0. 05). Cows in the late lactation stage came into the parlour later than the other cows, equally during morning and evening milkings (P< 0. 05). Relationships between the lactation stage and milking orders were positive and significant (0. 3730 *, 0. 3946 *, 0. 4822 **). We found that milk yield and behaviour at milking after relocation were influenced by the stage of lactation of the cows; however, the gestation stage had little longterm effect on the variables measured...|$|R

40|$|Jaboticaba is a {{fruit from}} a native tree to Brazil, Plinia peruviana. Jaboticaba peels are an {{important}} source of antioxidant molecules such as phenolic compounds. This study aimed to evaluate in vitro the activity of a hydroalcoholic extract of jaboticaba fruit peels (HEJFP) in wound healing processes and antioxidant activity in murine fibroblasts (L 929 cell line). HEJFP concentrations (0. 5, 1, 5, 10, <b>25,</b> <b>50,</b> 100, and 200 [*]µg/mL) were tested in MTT assay and cell proliferation was verified at 100 [*]µg/mL after 24 [*]h and at <b>25,</b> <b>50,</b> and 100 [*]µg/mL after 48 [*]h of extract exposure. Evaluation of antioxidant activity was performed at 0. 5, 5, <b>25,</b> <b>50,</b> and 100 [*]µg/mL HEJFP concentrations. Cell treatment with HEJFP at <b>25,</b> <b>50,</b> and 100 [*]µg/mL for 24 [*]h followed by H 2 O 2 exposure for 3 [*]h showed a strong cytoprotective effect. In vitro scratch wound healing assay indicated that none of tested HEJFP concentrations (0. 5, 5, <b>25,</b> <b>50,</b> and 100 [*]µg/mL) were capable of increasing migration rate after 12 [*]h of incubation. These results demonstrate a positive effect of HEJFP on the wound healing process on L 929 fibroblasts cell line, probably due to the antioxidant activity exhibited by phytochemicals in the extract...|$|R
