50|$|The {{downward}} flux {{of organic}} matter decreases sharply with depth, with 80-90% being consumed in the top 1000m.

In the surface layers, oxygen is supplied by exchange with the atmosphere.

Thus, long-term preservation of lens clarity may depend on the maintenance of hypoxia in the lens nucleus. We mapped the distribution of dissolved oxygen within isolated bovine lenses and also measured the rate of oxygen consumption (Q̇O 2) by lenses, or parts thereof. To assess the contribution of mitochondrial metabolism to the lens oxygen budget, we tested the effect of mitochondrial inhibitors on Q̇O 2 and partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2). The distribution of mitochondria was mapped in living lenses by 2 -photon microscopy. We found that a steep gradient of PO 2 was maintained within the tissue, leading to PO 2 < 2 mmHg in the core. Mitochondrial respiration accounted for approximately 90 % of the oxygen consumed by the lens; however, PO 2 gradients extended beyond the boundaries of the mitochondria-containing cell layer, indicating the presence of non-mitochondrial oxygen consumers. Time constants for oxygen consumption in various regions {{of the lens}} and an effective oxygen diffusion coefficient were calculated from a diffusion–consumption model. Typical values were 3 × 10 − 5 cm 2 s− 1 for the effective diffusion coefficient and a 5 min time constant for oxygen consumption. Surprisingly, the calculated time constants did not differ between differentiating fibres (DF) that contained mitochondria and mature fibres (MF) that did not. Based on these parameters, DF cells were responsible for approximately 88 % of lens oxygen consumption. A modest reduction in tissue temperature resulted in a marked decrease in Q̇O 2 and the subsequent flooding of the lens core with oxygen.

The origin of both waters is a blob of the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) drawn from offshore, and they are admixtures of CDW with overlying Winter Water in various proportions.

This leaves between one third and one half of the oxygen decrease to be explained by causes other than changes in water mass composition. An increase in the along-channel oxygen gradient from Cabot Strait to the LSLE over the past decades, combined with data from sediment cores, suggests that increased sediment oxygen demand may be partly responsible for the remainder of the oxygen decline.

The associated density variation of the water column explains only about one third of the seasonal variations in sea level at the coast, which suggests a large seasonal variation in barotropic coastal flow. Prominent freshening occurs in the WW layer during fall. This appears to be caused by the accumulation of WW, whose upper portion is freshened in the preceding summer. We think that this accumulation of the freshened (accordingly less dense) water is a possible reason why bottom water formation can not occur in this area. We propose that the seasonal variation in the WW layer is mainly caused by the seasonal variation in the wind over the coastal ocean. In fall the prevailing easterly wind intensifies, which increases the Ekman convergence of WW in the coastal ocean, while in summer the opposite occurs...|$|R

In the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC 125, the presence of multiple genes encoding 2 / 2 haemoglobins and a flavohaemoglobin strongly suggests that these proteins fulfil important physiological roles, perhaps associated to the peculiar features of the Antarctic habitat. In this work, the putative role of Ph- 2 / 2 HbO, encoded by the PSHAa 0030 gene, was investigated by in vivo and in vitro experiments in order to highlight its involvement in NO detoxification mechanisms. The PSHAa 0030 gene was cloned and then over-expressed in a flavohaemoglobin-deficient mutant of Escherichia coli, unable to metabolise NO, and the resulting strain was studied analysing its growth properties and oxygen uptake {{in the presence of}} NO. We here demonstrate that Ph- 2 / 2 HbO protects growth and cellular respiration of the heterologous host from the toxic effect of NO-donors. Unlike in Mycobacterium tuberculosis 2 / 2 HbN, the deletion of the N-terminal extension of Ph- 2 / 2 HbO does not seem to reduce the NO scavenging activity, showing that the N-terminal extension is not a requirement for efficient NO detoxification.

In the Indian Ocean the Amirante Passage is {{the sill}} through which rel-atively <b>cold,</b> fresh, <b>oxygen-rich,</b> and nutrient-poor bottom water spreads northward into the Somali Basin from the Mascarene Basin. The passage {{is also a}} conduit through which {{relatively}} warm, salty, oxygen-poor, and nutrient-rich deep water spreads south. Previous estimates for northward transport of bottom water in the passage have been made from station pairs and sections without benefit of tracer measurements. Previous estimates of southward transport of deep water are scarce. Three hydrographic sections were made across the passage in 1995 and 1996 {{as part of the}} World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). Two WOCE sections were also made perpendicular to the western boundary in the Mascarene Basin, just south of the passage. The geostrophic shear field is used with the salinity, dissolved oxygen, and silica distributions to select a range of zero-velocity surfaces (ZVSs) on potential isotherms from 1. 0 ø to 1. 1 øC (hence a range of geostrophic transports) for which the flow direction is consistent with the tracer distributions. Objective mapping is used to obtain flux estimates below the deepest common level of station pairs. Estimates in the Mascarene Basin result in a bottom water volume transport from 2. 5 to 3. 8 x 10 • m 3 s- 1 northward toward the passage below the ZVSs and a deep-water transport between the ZVSs and 2. 5 øC from 11. 6 to 6. 4 x 10 • m a s- • southward.

Consequently, the open water areas are maintained {{for a long period of}} time, despite considerable ice production. Such open waters, or coastal polynyas, release latent heat of fusion of ice and moisture from the ocean to the atmosphere. High-salinity brine is also excluded to the ocean by sea-ice formation. The polynyas may have great influence on the atmosphere-ocean interaction. Satellite images have suggested the presence of winter coastal polynyas between fast ice (or ice shelf) and pack ice regions off Lutzow-Holm Bay and Breid Bay, Antarctica. In 1990 - 1992,oceanographic observations were intensively conducted by the 31 st and 32 nd Japanese Antarctic Research Expeditions to understand sea-ice and oceanic processes in the polynya off Lutzow-Holm Bay. Under windy conditions, aircraft observations revealed many new-ice streaks formed approximately parallel to the wind direction and generation of frost smoke from the open water. Water temperature profiles in the polynya were obtained by using aircraft-deployed expendable bathythermographs (AXBT) with a depth capability of 460 m. Based on the temperature data, it is estimated that the thickness of the convective-mixed layer with its freezing point is 350 - 450 m. The mixed layer has a tendency to deepen in winter.

Recently, 2 ̆ 7 Weddell Gyre Study 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Japanese Antarctic Climate Research program 2 ̆ 7 have revealed the following seasonal variations in the Antarctic coastal ocean. First, {{the thickness of the}} Winter Water (WW) layer, characterized by <b>cold,</b> fresh, <b>oxygen-rich</b> water, exhibits its maximum in the austral fall and its minimum in the austral summer. Second, the Antarctic Coastal Current has maximum westward velocity in fall and a minimum in summer. Further, the sea-level variations at Syowa Station suggest a large seasonal variation in a barotropic flow. We have investigated the seasonal response of the coastal ocean to atmospheric forcing, using a numerical model, to clarify the mechanisms for these seasonal variations. The model is a three-dimensional OGCM, similar to that of Bryan and Cox. The model is forced both by the wind stress and the surface fluxes of salt and heat with their seasonal variations. The results of the model, with some theoretical interpretation, suggest the following mechanisms for the seasonal variations. The circulation in the Antarctic Ocean is mainly driven by wind forcing, slightly modified by thermohaline forcing. The seasonal response is interpreted as the sum of the wind-driven circulation associated with the curl of the wind stress and coastal downwelling associated with easterly wind at the coast. Because of the weak stratification, the former response is fairly barotropic. The variation in the coastal current is mainly caused by spin-up of the wind-driven gyre associated with the wind change, which is manifested by barotropic Rossby waves. The variation in downwelling or the WW thickness is interpreted as an internal Kelvin wave response...|$|R

The simulated volume transport for the major inflow in January 2003 amounts to about 250 km 3, half of which was of salinity 17 PSU which corresponds to a salt transport of 2. 7 x 10 (12) k...|$|R
40|$|Chemical tracers in seawater, {{as well as}} {{physical}} parameters such as temperature and salinity, have been measured to better characterize the dynamics of water convection and its spatiotemporal changes in the Sea of Japan (also called the Japan Sea), a semi-closed, hyperoxic marginal sea (maximum depth: ∼ 3, 800 m) in the northwestern corner of the Pacific Ocean. Repeated conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) observations and measurements of dissolved oxygen, for more than 30 years, have confirmed that the bottom layer of the Japan Sea, with a thickness of ∼ 1 km below the boundary at a depth of ∼ 2, 500 m, is characterized by vertical homogeneity with fluctuations of potential temperature and dissolved oxygen of < 0. 001 ◦C and < 0. 5 μmol kg− 1, respectively. The timescale of the abyssal circulation in the Japan Sea has been estimated to be 100 – 300 years, using 14 C and other chemical tracers. Stable isotope analyses for dissolved He, O 2 and CH 4 have given us information on their unique geochemical cycles in the Japan Sea. Profiles of the short-lived radioisotope 222 Rn just above the sea bottom have brought new insights into the short-term lateral water movement with a timescale of several days in the Japan Sea bottom water. It is of special concern that the gradual deoxygenation and warming of the bottom water over the last 30 years have resulted in an ∼ 10 % decrease in dissolved oxygen and ∼ 0. 04 ◦C increase in potential temperature, suggesting a change of the deep convection system in the Japan Sea. The temporal changes in the vertical profiles of tritium from 1984 to 1998 have suggested a shift of the abyssal circulation pattern from a “total (overall) convection mode” to a “shallow (partial) convection mode”. It is likely that the global warming since the last century has hindered the formation of dense surface seawater and its ability to sink down to the bottom, isolating the bottom layer from the deep convection loop that is indispensable as the source of <b>cold</b> and <b>oxygen-rich</b> water. However, the decreasing trend of bottom dissolved oxygen between 1977 and 2010 was not monotonous; rather, it was interrupted by an occasional break in the winter of 2000 – 2001, when severely cold weather may have resulted in especially dense surface water to sink down to the bottom layer for its ventilation...|$|R
40|$|The central {{problem of}} paleoceanography {{is the history}} of the {{circulation}} of the ocean. Although speculation about ancient oceanic circulation goes back to the past century, the field of paleoceanography was founded in the 1950 s as oxygen-isotope studies suggested that oceanic deep waters were warmer in the past than they are today. Extensive coring of deep-sea sediments by numerous expeditions after World War II was followed by the ocean drilling programs, providing a rich data base. Paleoceanographic interpretations have tried to explain the most obvious changes in sea-floor sediments and their contained fossils: changing paleotemperatures indicated by oxygen isotopes, fluctuations in the calcium carbonate compensation depth, accumulations of organic carbon-rich sediments, and the unexpected abundance of hiatuses in a setting which had been thought to be the ultimate sedimentary sink. The result has been the intriguing discovery that although the positions and circulation of the major surface gyres is generally stable, the deep circulation of the ocean may reverse on a variety of time scales. It has been suggested that formation of North Atlantic Deep Water, which causes the uneven distribution of nutrients, alkalinity, and oxygen in the deep sea today, may have been replaced by formation of North Pacific Deep Water during the last deglaciation, reversing the concentration gradients of nutrients, alkalinity, and oxygen. On a longer time scale, the present general circulation, which is dominated by production of <b>oxygen-rich</b> <b>cold</b> deep water in the subpolar regions today, may have replaced a pre-Oligocene general circulation in which warm, saline, oxygen-poor deep waters were formed in warm seas in the arid zones. Paleoceanography is still in its infancy; many new clues to the history of the ocean are being discovered, and many new ideas about conditions in the past are being developed. The beginning of the next century should see continuing rapid growth and maturation in this exciting new field...|$|R
