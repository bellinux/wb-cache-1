50|$|This is ancient {{semi-natural}} woodland on acidic soils, and it {{has been}} forested for over 700 years. It is mainly pedunculate oak, with varied ground flora including <b>creeping</b> <b>soft-grass,</b> wood anemone, yellow archangel and bluebell. A small marsh has very diverse herbs.|$|E
50|$|Grasslees Wood is {{dominated}} by sessile oak (Quercus petraea) with some birch (Betula pubescens). Groundcover indicitive of a dry acid soil includes sweet vernal grass, common bent, <b>creeping</b> <b>soft-grass</b> (Holcus mollis), wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella), tormentil (Potentilla erecta) and bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), together with remote sedge (Carex remota), oak fern (Gymnocarpium dryopteris) and enchanter's nightshade (Circaea lutetiana).|$|E
50|$|On the plateau, brambles, bracken and {{rosebay willowherb}} occupy {{extensive}} patches, {{but a more}} mixed ground flora occurs between these, including <b>creeping</b> <b>soft-grass</b> (Holcus mollis), hairy brome (Bromus ramosus), tufted hair-grass (Deschampsia cespitosa), wood millet (Milium effusum) and wood melick (Melica uniflora). Pill sedge (Carex pilulifera), hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa) and slender St. John's-wort (Hypericum pulchrum) are found in more heathy areas, and the rushes Juncus effusus and J. conglomeratus are present in damper areas.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{distinct}} assemblages of flora are observed at Briarwood Banks. Dominant on lower slopes is wych elm (Ulmus glabra), beneath which are found dog’s mercury (Mercurialis perennis), woodruff (Galium odoratum), wood melick (Melica uniflora), giant bellflower (Campanula latifolia), enchanter’s nightshade (Circaea lutetiana) and wood avens (Geum urbanum). Oak (Quercus petraea) predominates the higher slopes with <b>creeping</b> <b>soft-grass</b> (Holcus mollis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella) and broad buckler-fern (Dryopteris dilatata); and on very acid soil beneath oaks, great wood-rush (Luzula sylvatica), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and common cow-wheat (Melampyrum pratense) are found.|$|E
