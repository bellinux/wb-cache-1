5000|$|Notonecta, or the <b>common</b> <b>{{backswimmer}},</b> is a genus of backswimmer {{insects in}} the family Notonectidae. Species in this genus include: ...|$|E
50|$|Notonectidae is a {{cosmopolitan}} family of aquatic insects {{in the order}} Hemiptera, commonly called Backswimmers because they swim upside down. The <b>Common</b> <b>Backswimmer,</b> Notonecta glauca, is widespread in the United Kingdom, where it {{is known as the}} greater water boatman, and in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The larvae {{are called}} bloodworms because some larva are bright red, {{but they can}} also be found in brown and almost black. When the larva pupate, they drift towards the surface, making them {{vulnerable}} to many types of fish. Other common predators include the <b>common</b> <b>backswimmer</b> (Notonecta glauca), common pondskater (Gerris lacustris), common toad (Bufo bufo), lesser water boatman (Corixa punctata), dragonflies, damselflies, great crested newt (Triturus cristatus), great diving beetle (Dytiscus marginalis), redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), smooth newt (Triturus vulgaris), water scorpion (Nepa cinerea) and other midges such as Anatopynia plumipes.|$|E
5000|$|The most <b>common</b> genus of <b>Backswimmers</b> is Notonecta - streamlined, deep-bodied bugs up to 16 mm long, green, brown, or {{yellowish}} in colour. N. maculata, {{is distinguished}} by its mottled brick-coloured forewings.|$|R
5000|$|Notonecta undulata, {{also known}} by the <b>common</b> name grousewinged <b>backswimmer,</b> are from the family Notonectidae and the insect {{suborder}} Heteroptera. They are a type of hemipteran or true bug. These aquatic insects typically spend their time at the water's surface, using their abdomen and legs to cling to {{the underside of the}} surface tension. The Grousewinged backswimmer can be found in both lotic and lentic environments; however, they typically prefer small ponds and lakes where the water is slow-moving with less current. They swim upside down looking for prey. Once they stop swimming they float back up to the surface. These insects can be distinguished from water boatman or Corixidae by their segmented beak and front legs. Water boatman have highly modified front legs whereas backswimmers do not. Backswimmers are distributed across a broad range throughout North America. However, the species Notonecta undulata has only been documented and studied in southern Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the western United States. N. undulata differs from other backswimmers by their antennae and size. They are approximately 10-12 mm long, and their antennae are 4 segmented ...|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the species}} within this infraorder live in {{freshwater}} habitats. The exceptions {{are members of the}} superfamily Ochteroidea, which are found along the water's edge. Many of these insects are predators of invertebrates and in some cases - like the large water scorpions (Nepidae) and giant water bugs (Belostomatidae) - even small fish and amphibians. Others are omnivores or feed on plants. Their mouthparts form a rostrum as in all Heteroptera and most Hemiptera. With this, they pierce their foodstuffs to suck out fluids; some, like the Corixidae, are also able to chew their food to some extent, sucking up the resulting pulp. The rostrum {{can also be used to}} sting in defence; some, like the <b>common</b> <b>backswimmer</b> (Notonecta glauca) of the Notonectidae can easily pierce the skin of humans and deliver a wound often more painful than a bee's sting.|$|E
5000|$|Notonecta glauca is {{a species}} of aquatic insect, and a type of backswimmer. It is the most {{widespread}} and abundant of the four British notonectids. They are also found throughout North America. Notonecta glauca are Hemiptera (true bug) predators, that are approximately 13-16 mm in length. They are the most <b>common</b> <b>backswimmer</b> species (49%). Females have a larger body size compared to males. These water insects swim and rest on their back (hence their common name [...] "Backswimmer" [...] or [...] "Water Boatman") and are found under the water surface. Notonecta glauca supports itself under the water surface by using their front legs and mid legs and {{the back end of}} its abdomen and rest them on the water surface; They are able to stay under the water surface by water tension, also known as the air-water interface (Surface tension). they use the hind legs as oars. Notonecta glauca will either wait for its prey to pass by or will swim and actively hunt its prey. When the weather is warm, usually in the late summer and autumn, they will fly between ponds. Notonecta glauca reproduce in the spring.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the value}} of carbon (δ 13 C) and {{nitrogen}} (δ 15 N) stable isotope ratios were determined in nymphs of a top-predator, the <b>common</b> <b>backswimmer</b> (Notonecta glauca L.), collected in 18 m 3 outdoor freshwater mesocosms {{used to assess the}} fate and ecotoxicological effects of a diphenyl ether herbicide, fomesafen, applied alone or in combination with Agral 90 ® (mixture of polyethoxylated derivatives of nonylphenol). Both treatments had a negative effect on δ 13 C values which may reflect changes in carbon fluxes across food webs in the treated ponds associated with a shift in phytoplankton structure. A decrease in δ 15 N values was observed in the nymphs collected in mixture-treated ponds, which was presumably due to an increase in the abundance of rotifers and Chironominae larvae in these ponds. These preliminary results indicate that stable isotope ratios may be used as shortcuts to detect qualitative or quantitative shifts in the structure of aquatic food webs caused by pollutants. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios may be used to detect the impact of pollutants on aquatic food webs...|$|E
40|$|The <b>common</b> <b>backswimmer,</b> Notonecta glauca, uses vision by day {{and night}} for {{functions}} such as underwater prey animal capture and flight in search of new habitats. Although previous studies have identified some of the physiological mechanisms facilitating such flexibility in the animal's vision, neither the biophysics of Notonecta photoreceptors nor possible cellular adaptations are known. Here, we studied Notonecta photoreceptors using patch-clamp and intracellular recording methods. Photoreceptor size (approximated by capacitance) was positively correlated with absolute sensitivity and acceptance angles. Information rate measurements indicated that large and more sensitive photoreceptors performed better than small ones. Our results suggest that backswimmers are adapted for vision in both dim and well-illuminated environments by having open-rhabdom eyes with large intrinsic variation in absolute sensitivity among photoreceptors, exceeding those found in purely diurnal or nocturnal species. Both electrophysiology and microscopic analysis of retinal structure suggest two retinal subsystems: the largest peripheral photoreceptors provide vision in dim light and the smaller peripheral and central photoreceptors function primarily in sunlight, with light-dependent pigment screening further contributing to adaptation in this system by dynamically recruiting photoreceptors with varying sensitivity into the operational pool...|$|E
