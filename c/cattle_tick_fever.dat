40|$|The {{southern}} {{cattle tick}} (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus) is a hematophagous external parasite that vectors the causative agents of bovine babesiosis or <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever,</b> Babesia bovis and B. bigemina, and anaplasmosis, Anaplasma marginale. The {{southern cattle tick}} {{is a threat to}} the livestock industry in many locations throughout the world. Control methods include the use of chemical acaricides including amitraz, a formamidine insecticide, which is proposed to activate octopamine receptors. Previous studies have identified a putative octopamine receptor from the southern cattle tick in Australia and the Americas. Furthermore, this putative octopamine receptor could play a role in acaricide resistance to amitraz. Recently, sequence data indicated that this putative octopamine receptor is probably a type- 1 tyramine receptor (TAR 1). In this study, the putative TAR 1 was heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K 1) cells, and the expressed receptor resulted in a 39 -fold higher potency for tyramine compared to octopamine. Furthermore, the expressed receptor was strongly antagonized by yohimbine and cyproheptadine, and mildly antagonized by mianserin and phentolamine. Tolazoline and naphazoline had agonistic or modulatory activity against the expressed receptor, as did the amitraz metabolite, BTS- 27271; however, this was only observed in the presence of tyramine.

40|$|Background For > 100 years cattle {{production}} in the southern United States has been threatened by cattle fever. It is caused by an invasive parasite-vector complex that includes the protozoan hemoparasites Babesia bovis and B. bigemina, which are transmitted among domestic cattle via Rhipicephalus tick vectors of the subgenus Boophilus. In 1906 an eradication effort was started and by 1943 Boophilus ticks had been confined to a narrow tick eradication quarantine area (TEQA) along the Texas-Mexico border. However, {{a dramatic increase in}} tick infestations in areas outside the TEQA over the last decade suggests these tick vectors may be poised to re-invade the southern United States. We investigated historical and potential future distributions of climatic habitats of cattle fever ticks to assess the potential for a range expansion. Methods We built robust spatial predictions of habitat suitability for the vector species Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus and R. (B.) annulatus across the southern United States for three time periods: 1906, present day (2012), and 2050. We used analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) to identify persistent tick occurrences and analysis of bias in the climate proximate to these occurrences to identify key environmental parameters associated with the ecology of both species. We then used ecological niche modeling algorithms GARP and Maxent to construct models that related known occurrences of ticks in the TEQA during 2001 - 2011 with geospatial data layers that summarized important climate parameters at all three time periods. Results We identified persistent tick infestations and specific climate parameters that appear to be drivers of ecological niches of the two tick species. Spatial models projected onto climate data representative of climate in 1906 reproduced historical pre-eradication tick distributions. Present-day predictions, although constrained to areas near the TEQA, extrapolated well onto climate projections for 2050. Conclusions Our models indicate the potential for range expansion of climate suitable for survival of R. microplus and R. annulatus in the southern United States by mid-century, which increases the risk of reintroduction of these ticks and <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> <b>fever</b> into major cattle producing areas.

While cattle are the primary host for <b>cattle</b> <b>fever</b> <b>ticks,</b> wild and exotic ungulates, including white-tailed deer (WTD), {{are known to be}} viable alternative hosts. The presence of <b>cattle</b> <b>fever</b> <b>tick</b> populations resistant to acaricides raises concerns regarding the possibility of these alternative hosts introducing tick-borne babesial parasites into areas free of infection. Understanding the B. bovis reservoir competence of these alternative hosts is critical to mitigating the risk of introduction. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that WTD are susceptible to infection with a B. bovis strain lethal to cattle. Two groups of deer were inoculated intravenously with either B. bovis blood stabilate or a larval extract supernatant containing sporozoites from infected R. microplus larvae. The collective data demonstrated that WTD are neither a transient host nor reservoir of B. bovis. This conclusion is supported by the failure of B. bovis to establish an infection in deer regardless of inoculum. Although specific antibody was detected for a short period in the WTD, the PCR results were consistently negative at multiple time points throughout the experiment and blood from WTD that had been exposed to parasite, transferred into naïve recipient susceptible calves, failed to establish infection. In contrast, naïve steers inoculated intravenously with either B. bovis blood stabilate or the larval extract supernatant containing sporozoites rapidly succumbed to disease. These findings provide evidence that WTD are not an epidemiological component in the maintenance of B. bovis infectivity to livestock...|$|R

Conclusions Immunity to Babesia bovis and B bigemina — A single inoculation generally provides sound, long-lasting protection both in Australia and overseas. No evidence was found of a loss of immunity with time. Vaccine failures to B bovis do occur, but are uncommon and evidently caused by a number of factors, including immune responsiveness of the vaccinated animals, and immunogenicity of the vaccine strain. Immunity to Anaplasma marginale— The vaccine containing A centrale provides partial, variable protection against A marginale. Protection against challenge in Australia is adequate in most cases to prevent disease and use of the vaccine in this country appears to be justified. Protection against antigenically diverse, highly virulent stocks of A marginale in other countries is, at times, clearly inadequate and better vaccines are required in situations where the challenge is severe. ...|$|R

More ants were collected in the native vegetation which also had greater species richness and biological diversity than ants collected from Arundo stands. It is suggested that the greater heterogeneous nature of native vegetation provided greater and more predictable nourishment in the form of nectars and more abundant arthropod prey when compared with Arundo stands...|$|R

It was reported the government decided that while Pound was to continue supervising the institute's work on plague outbreaks and other human pathology, his attention should again be directed to livestock: <b>tick</b> <b>fever,</b> pleuropneumonia, lumpy jaw, swine fever, swamp cancer, sheep parasites, and poultry diseases. As a result, in August 1907 supervision and control of the institute were returned to the agricultural department.|$|R

40|$|The {{southern}} <b>cattle</b> <b>fever</b> <b>tick,</b> Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, is {{no doubt}} the most economically important ectoparasite of cattle globally. The inappropriate use of chemical acaricides has driven the evolution of resistance in populations of R. (B.) microplus. Anti-tick vaccines represent a technology that can be combined with acaricides in integrated control programs to mitigate the impact of R. (B.) microplus. The recombinant form of Bm 86 antigen from the Campo Grande (rBm 86 -CG) strain of R. (B.) microplus was produced using the Pichiapastoris expression system to test its ability to immunoprotect <b>cattle</b> against <b>tick</b> infestation. Secretion of rBm 86 -CG by P. pastoris through the bioprocess reported here simplified purification of the antigen. A specific humoral immune response was detected by ELISA in vaccinated cattle. Immunoblot results revealed that polyclonal antibodies from vaccinated cattle recognized a protein in larval extracts with a molecular weight corresponding to Bm 86. The rBm 86 -CG antigen showed 31 % efficacy against the Campo Grande strain of R. (B.) microplus infesting vaccinated cattle. The rBm 86 -CG is an antigen {{that could be used}} in a polyvalent vaccine as part of an integrated program for the control of R. (B.) microplus in the region that includes Mato Grosso do Sul...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe <b>cattle</b> <b>tick,</b> Rhipicephalus microplus, is {{regarded}} as the most economically important ectoparasite of livestock globally. Control is achieved primarily through the use of acaricides. This approach is hampered by the development of resistance to commercial acaricides among <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> populations. Vaccination against R. microplus infestation is another technology that can be integrated for effective <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> control. Proteins belonging to the Kunitz-BPTI family are abundant in <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> salivary glands, midgut, and ovaries. These organs are attractive targets {{for the development of a}} novel <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> vaccine. Efficacy assessment against <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> infestation in bovines using a vaccine containing the recombinant form of a member of the Kunitz family from R. microplus produced in a yeast expression system is reported for the first time here. The yeast Pichia pastoris was bioengineered to produce the recombinant version of a trypsin inhibitor that is expressed in <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> larvae (rRmLTI). Immunization with rRmLTI afforded 32 % efficacy against R. microplus. The estimated molecular weight of rRmLTI was 46 kDa. Structural homology to the native form of the larval trypsin inhibitor was documented by recognition of rRmLTI in Western-blots using polyclonal antibodies from mice immunized with <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> larval extract or rRmLTI. Bioinformatics analysis of the partial nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the rRmLTI closely resembles BmTI- 6, which is a three-headed Kunitz protein present in <b>cattle</b> <b>tick</b> ovary and fat tissue...|$|R
