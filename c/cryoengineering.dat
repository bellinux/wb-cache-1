50|$|Commission A1 - Cryophysics, <b>Cryoengineering</b> {{deals with}} research, {{development}} and industrial {{activities at the}} lowest temperatures, including low-temperature physics, applications of superconductivity and helium cryogenics.|$|E
50|$|The Commission {{is close}} to academia, {{industry}} and end users of separated and liquefied gases.Commission members work closely with Commission A1 Cryophysics, <b>Cryoengineering</b> and Commission C1 Cryobiology, Cryomedicine and Health Products.|$|E
50|$|This Commission {{is truly}} active and {{participates in the}} various {{workshop}} series on cryoprocessing of biopharmaceuticals and biomaterials, as well as establishing innovative e-training actions concerning the Commissionâ€™s multidisciplinary needs {{as well as the}} interdisciplinary needs of the following commissions: A1 Cryophysics, <b>Cryoengineering,</b> A2 Liquefaction and Separation of Gases and finally C1 Cryobiology, Cyomedicine and Health Products.|$|E
50|$|Section A {{comprises}} two Commissions, A1 Cryophysics and <b>Cryoengineering,</b> and A2 Liquefaction and Separation of Gases. Commission A1 {{deals with}} research, development and industrial {{activities at the}} lowest temperatures, including low-temperature physics, applications of superconductivity and helium cryogenics. Commission A2 essentially covers the liquefied gas industry, including air separation and LNG technology, two mature domains with high economic stakes and ongoing developments addressing important societal issues such as energy efficiency and carbon sequestration.|$|E
40|$|High-pure monocrystals of compensed metals - tungsten, molybdenium, phenium and {{ruthenium}} - {{are considered}} in the paper aiming at the experimental investigation of particular features of the conduction electrons scattering on the crystal surface, on defects of a crystalline lattice and on phonons in strong magnetic fields with {{the account of the}} statistical spin-effect n compensed metals. As a result the existence of the statictical skin-effect in compensed metals in strong magnetic fields has been established. The Pajels' mechanism of the electrons scattering on phonons and strong deviations from the Ohm law have been detected. Some directions of the use of high-pure compensed metals as a working body of active and passive elements of devices of cryoelectronics and <b>cryoengineering</b> have been developedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
