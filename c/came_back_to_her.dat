500|$|As Gaga {{performed}} on The Monster Ball Tour, Garibay {{started working on}} {{the music of the}} song. After the show was over, Gaga <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> studio bus and asked him about the progress. Garibay then explained that he had concocted a different kind of music for the song, and played the church-bell inspired music to Gaga. After first hearing it, the singer said that she started to cry, noticing the vastness of the music, and she started writing the lyrics for [...] "Marry the Night". [...] "Marry the Night" [...] was originally recorded on the Bus Studio in 2010, but was later mixed at The Mix Room in Burbank, California by Dave Russell, assisted by Paul Pavao. Gaga described the song as a [...] "massive, gas-station, disco record", and she recorded it immediately after completing the lyrics. According to Garibay, Gaga meditated {{for a few minutes and}} then asked him to hand over a recording microphone to her, completing the process within an hour.|$|E
2500|$|When Santhumala <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{home and}} found that the girls were gone, she flew into a rage. She quickly found out where they were and {{transformed}} herself into a very beautiful young woman, more beautiful than any of the twelve sisters; then she went to the city of the king and asked to meet him. The king was spellbound by Santhumala's beauty and swiftly married her, promoting her to the rank of first queen.|$|E
2500|$|While Karen {{was not in}} {{any serious}} danger of being fired, Sir Alan disliked {{the fact that she}} did not say {{anything}} in her defence. Despite Jo's questionable behaviour, in which she believed Sir Alan's consideration of firing her was [...] "bizarre" [...] and accused her team of sidelining her, Sir Alan noted that she had been {{on the right side of}} the argument over the calendar, thus making Nargis the obvious choice to go. Sir Alan did not actually fault Nargis for the cat theme, as everyone except Jo had been in favour of it, but felt that all subsequent failings <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> leadership.|$|E

2500|$|After the war, {{the fight}} for {{abortion}} rights was renewed and Browne <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> fight {{for the education of}} women in matters of sex. Her endeavors on this front afforded her the rank of first Patron and later Vice-President of the Society for Sex Education and Guidance, a group set up in 1943. [...] She continued to be involved with the ALRA until her death, however she was unable to attend most of their meetings due to failing health. [...] During this time, she was giving suggestions for actions that the ALRA could perform and these were continually followed. [...] Browne’s opinions on sexual reform were clearly still valued despite her increasing age and inability to be as involved as she once was. Browne was able to see the time come when medical terminations of pregnancy became more common though, which was a comfort to her.|$|E
