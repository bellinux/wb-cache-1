Using high sensitivity (below 1 K) and high angular resolution (0. 5 - 1. 0 degree), high quality images have been made. The following measurements are discussed: cloud and fog penetration at 90 GHz, discrimination between agricultural and urban areas, discrimination between different vegetation types, detection of vehicles on roads, detection and <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> and airplanes, ship detection and quantitative oil spill sensing. The application of information enhancement techniques with automatic and real time application aspects is also described, and results of applied techniques for contrast and contour enhancement are shown...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} selected {{results of}} airborne, radiometric imaging measurements at 90 GHz and 140 GHz relevant {{for the application}} in reconnaissance. Using a temperature resolution below 0. 5 K and an angular resolution of about 1 -degree high-quality images show the capability of discriminating between many brightness temperature classes within our natural environment and man-made objects. Measurement examples are given for cloud and fog penetration at 90 GHz, {{for the detection of}} vehicles on roads, and for the detection and <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> and airplanes. The application of different contour enhancement methods (Marr-Hildreth and Canny) shows the possibility of extracting lines and shapes precisely in order to improve automatic target recognition. The registration of the passive images with corresponding X-band synthetic aperture images from the same area is carried out and the high degree of correlation is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} meant to provide an insight into the roles and {{characteristics}} of the different typologies of airports by detailing a functional framework of European airports through the analysis of their distinctive features and interconnecting network. The {{first part of the}} work will focus on the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> and their peculiarities following the most recent developments in this sector. The analysis will then turn to the methodology employed to verify the existence of subsystems (or modules) of high interconnectivity within the European aviation network. The classification hereby provided will therefore define the airports both as separate entities with specific characteristics and as parts of a particular network. The results will lead to the identification of major groups gathering together a number of airports characterised by similar features and goals. This paper will also hint at the existence of a solid parallel network within Europe, consisting of socalled secondary airports interconnected by means of low-cost carriers. It should here be stressed that the late development of the European airport network has been prompted by market-driven pressures rather than by clear-cut domestic or European schemes.

40|$|Rating of the {{aircraft}} load effect and reporting structural <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> pavements have always been interesting tasks for pavement Engineers. Up to now, most of the methods used to handle these aspects {{have been based on}} a semi-empirical background; only recently few preliminary {{attempts have been made to}} adopt the use of analytical tools and models in this area. Following this, the introduction of an alternative procedure for rating {{the aircraft}} load and reporting the bearing capacity of pavements based on analytical models is being investigated. The related research included 3 D finite element models as well as multi-layer elastic ones. Investigations showed that it is possible to introduce a flexible alternative methodology compatible with recent analytical method and tools and at the same time to retain the simplicity <b>of</b> the traditional <b>classification</b> systems. The overall appreciation provided very promising results on the accuracy and reliability of the proposed alternative, which indicates that this approach can be a useful tool for several airport pavement applications. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. It is {{important}} for Ukraine to have a network <b>of</b> <b>airports,</b> which would promote the current and long-term implementation of air transportation needs {{of the population and}} the economics. This study aims to establish criteria <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> <b>classification</b> to determine their {{role in the development of}} the air transport system of Ukraine. Methodology. The methods of statistical analysis were used for the processing of data according to categories <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> productivity and geographic information system for data visualization. Findings. It is established that the existing division <b>of</b> Ukrainian <b>airports</b> into international and domestic, as well as into coordinated and non-coordinated ones is not relevant for determining the role <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> in the development of air transport system of the country and accordingly for the priority in financing of their modernization. The approach to the determination <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> <b>classifications</b> using analysis <b>of</b> performance categories was developed. Originality. <b>Classification</b> criterions <b>of</b> the <b>airports</b> in Ukraine are proposed: by type of activity and by the maintenance of scheduled route network. It is proposed to classify the airports by the type of activity to the primary commercial, commercial, cargo primary commercial, cargo commercial and general aviation. According to the scheduled route network maintenane it is proposed to classify the airports as the primary, non-primary and auxiliary hubs. An example <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> by the given criteria is submitted. Practical value. The value of the obtained results is in the possibility of using the proposed classification in the task of determining the priorities for financing the country's airports. As opposed to the practice of directed funding procedure in the framework of the state program <b>of</b> <b>airports</b> development, it is proposed to take into account the fact that the resumption of the functioning <b>of</b> the <b>airport</b> and/or its modernization should be as a response to effective demand of consumers (in this case, airlines), which will be the guarantors of investment return...|$|R

40|$|Many {{airports}} {{all over}} the world have established restrictions for the use of thrust reverse for slowing down aircraft after landings, especially during the night period, as a way of reducing noise impact and the number of complaints in the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>airports.</b> This is the case <b>of</b> Madrid <b>airport,</b> where the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, in collaboration with AENA, and the Politecnico di Milano have been researching, and developing intelligent instruments to improve the detection and <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> thrust reverse noise among other noise sources present in the airport. Based on a traditional approach, the thrust reverse noise detection tool detects two consecutive sound events, and applies pattern recognition techniques for the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> each of them (such as landing and thrust reverse). A second improvement refers to the use of a microphone array linked to a noisemonitoring unit, which enables tracking the direction of arrival of the sound, thus improving the classification rates. By taking the latter, it is also possible to track the aircraft location along the runway, which enables sound pressure measurements to be transformed into sound power level estimations. Although the novel instrument can still be optimized and customized, the results have shown quite good classification rates (over 90 %) ...|$|R

The effect <b>of</b> <b>airport</b> size on overall local employment is practically zero, suggesting that airports lead to specialization but not growth at the metropolitan-area level.
