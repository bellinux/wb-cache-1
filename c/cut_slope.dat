40|$|The {{stability}} and deformation {{of the permanent}} shiplock slopes are among the key issues {{in the design and}} construction of the Three Gorges Project. The permanent shiplock slopes, formed by deeply and steeply cutting into weathered and fresh granites, are 1607 m in length and 50 - 170 m in height. The disturbed zone in the permanent <b>cut</b> <b>slopes</b> induced by excavation is therefore {{one of the most important}} aspects in slope {{stability and}} deformation evaluation. A comprehensive investigation including non-linear finite element analysis, in-situ testing, instrumentation and monitoring, back analysis and rock mass quality rating has been carried out for the identification and evaluation of the excavation disturbed zone in the permanent <b>cut</b> <b>slopes.</b> The results of the investigation confirmed the existence of such an excavation disturbed zone in the permanent <b>cut</b> <b>slopes.</b> This zone is characterized by a considerable weakening in the mechanical properties of the rock mass. From the cut surface to the deeper region of the permanent <b>cut</b> <b>slopes,</b> the excavation disturbed zone can be further divided into a damaged zone, an affected zone and a slightly affected zone according to the extent of weakening in the rock mass. The damaged zone and the affected zone have thicknesses of 5 - 10 m and 10 - 20 m, respectively. The exact pattern of the excavation disturbed zone is variable in different parts of the permanent <b>cut</b> <b>slopes</b> and are generally similar to that of the plastic zones estimated by using the non-linear finite element analysis. The present investigation has provided both factual data and insights for the stability and deformation evaluation of the permanent shiplock slopes.

This paper discusses use of finite-element analyses with the computer program, PLAXIS, to evaluate long-term performance of <b>cut</b> <b>slopes</b> at the Virginia Route 288 project, near Richmond, Virginia, USA. The 9 -meter high <b>cut</b> <b>slopes</b> are located near an area {{with a history of}} slope failures. Limit-equilibrium slope stability analyses based on the conventional subsurface investigation approach using borings and overly-conservative soil parameters derived from Standard Penetration Test results and back-analyses of historical slope failures near this area, indicated that the <b>cut</b> <b>slopes</b> will be stable at a slope ratio of 5 -horizontal-to- 1 -vertical (5 H: 1 V).

The Present study involves rockfall hazard assessment of road <b>cut</b> <b>slopes</b> for 15 km distance starting from Mahabaleshwar town along State Highway- 72 (SH- 72).

It provides an active input into mine planning. The early identification of movement zones allows steps {{to be taken to}} minimize the impact of mining on stability by the implementation of corrective measures. The main objective of slope monitoring study is to detect any instability well in advance so that any damage to men and machineries can be avoided. If any instability is detected in the early stage then it can be stabilized by applying the suitable remedial measure. The slope materials are inherently weak in the mine. Slope stability monitoring was done in NALCO mine. There were many <b>cut</b> <b>slope</b> areas most of them for the passage of the cable belt conveyor. In order to check the stability of those cut slopes it was proposed the approach of numerical modelling and graphical analysis. The numerical modelling was done in OASYS software and the stability of the sites area checked and factor of safety (FOS) is found in the stable region. On the basis of Numerical Modelling for the geo-mining condition of <b>cut</b> <b>slope</b> surrounding NALCO mine, the factor of safety for the <b>Cut</b> <b>slope</b> I, (near deep cut area), <b>Cut</b> <b>slope</b> II, (near drive house area of height 32 m), <b>Cut</b> <b>slope</b> III, (near drive house area of height 24 m), and <b>Cut</b> <b>slope</b> IV, (near part II mine area) are respectively 1. 335, 1. 332, 1. 324 and 1. 224 with corresponding <b>cut</b> <b>slope</b> height of 20 m, 32 m, 24 m and 35 m.

The <b>cut</b> <b>slopes</b> are near vertical to sub-vertical and overhangs are ubiquitous at several locations.

The study then uses 2 D rockfall analysis for estimating loss of energy {{due to the}} impact of falling blocks on the slope face and subsequently on the road. Several parameters were also assessed from the study viz. bounce height, travel distance, kinetic energy and translational velocity. The result from rockfall analysis shows that the energy and velocity achieved by the falling blocks are considerably high, capable enough to cause severe damage. In relation to energy and velocity, bounce height achieved is not very large. Because of removal of trees from the slopes face and no measures to capture falling blocks, the problems have been aggravated and therefore, most of the rock covers very large distance to reach up to the valley crossing the roadways endangering travelers and infrastructures.

As a slope deteriorates, the risk of slope failure increases with time and may reach an intolerable level at a certain time.

Residual soils are formed due to the weathering of rocks and lie {{at the location of}} the parent rock. They are characterized by the significant variations in the level of weathering and the composition of the weathered product over short distances, Quite often, the ground water table is low during the dry season and these soils are in an unsaturated state.

Random sloughing {{of the canal}} side slopes began to occur 2 years after con-struction over a 7500 m length of canal and was nearly continuous over a 2500 m length 3 years later. The sloughs are shallow seated and most had {{the appearance of a}} “mud ” flow. Soil salinity also developed along the canal slopes due to capillarity and evaporation. Failure of the clay <b>slopes</b> in the <b>cut</b> sections is attributed to swelling, dispersion, and softening of the subgrade due to exposure of the salt-laden clays to fresh water. In contrast, 600 m of salt-rich clayey colluvium compacted as a clay liner on the canal side slopes showed no evidence of sloughing and salt loading after 9 years of service. Good soil compaction inhibited softening and slope instability in these salt-rich soils. Results from de-tailed site investigations and observations, and the interplay of soil chemistry and geology, facilitated the selection of a satisfactory method of repair.

The corresponding costs of the proposed soil nailing works are then estimated. The two slice methods are compared on the basis of both slope safety and construction cost. It is found that the construction cost of soil nailing stabilisation works adopting Janbu's simplified method could be 10 % to 90 % higher than that adopting the Morgenstern-Price method under the same safety standards. Technical reasons for such substantial differences are also given in the paper. It is believed that the findings presented in the paper could be used to reduce soil nail construction costs without sacrifice of the current slope safety standards. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
