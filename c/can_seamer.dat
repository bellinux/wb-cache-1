50|$|Use of a Statistical Process Control (SPC) {{software}} {{in conjunction with}} a manual double-seam monitor, computerized double seam scanner, or even a fully automatic double seam inspection system makes the laborious process of double seam inspection faster and much more accurate. Statistically tracking the performance of each head or seaming station of the <b>can</b> <b>seamer</b> allows for better prediction of <b>can</b> <b>seamer</b> issues, and may be used to plan maintenance when convenient, rather than to simply react after bad or unsafe cans have been produced.|$|E
50|$|A <b>can</b> <b>seamer</b> is {{a machine}} used {{to seal the}} lid to the can body. The lid or ' 'end' ' is usually tinplated steel while the body can be of metal (such as cans for {{beverages}} and soups), paperboard (whisky cans) or plastic.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{there are}} several {{parameters}} {{that can be used}} to judge seam quality, the FDA regulation specifies the most critical parameters: [...] "The most critical attributes to consider in judging the quality of the double seam are overlap and tightness (wrinkle). If one of the can seam measurements (i.e., body hook) is slightly beyond the specified guidelines but the rest of the seam is evaluated and the overlap and tightness (wrinkle) are within specified guidelines, then adjustments to the <b>seamer</b> <b>can</b> be made at the next scheduled shut-down. In this instance, the manufacturer should identify the out-of-guideline measurement and document they have evaluated the rest of the double seam, but did not find immediate corrective action necessary. However, if overlap measurement or tightness rating evaluation are below the minimum guidelines a resample from the questionable seaming station should be made. If the resample continues to show out-of-guideline measurements in overlap and/or wrinkle the machine should be stopped and adjusted." ...|$|R
