LeMay {{was considered}} {{instrumental in the}} establishment in 1947 of the United States Air Force and an expert in military affairs.

To keep LeMay on the ticket, Wallace backer and Texas oil tycoon H. L.

[...] I think there may be times when it would be most efficient to use nuclear weapons."
