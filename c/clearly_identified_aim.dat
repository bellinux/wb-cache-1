40|$|Teaching art by digital {{means is}} a big {{challenge}} {{for the majority of}} teachers of art and design in primary schools, yet it allows relationships between art, technology and creativity to be <b>clearly</b> <b>identified.</b> The <b>aim</b> {{of this article is to}} present a modern way of teaching art, using digital tools in the art classroom to improve creative ability in pupils aged between nine and eleven years. It also presents a conceptual model for creativity based on digital art. The model could be useful for pupils interested in learning to draw by using an e-drawing package, and for teachers who are interested in teaching modern digital art in order to improve children’s creativity. By illustrating the strategy of teaching art through technology, this model may also help education providers to make suitable choices about which technological approaches are most effective in enhancing students’ creative ability, and which digital art tools can benefit children by developing their technical skills. It is also expected that use of this model will help to develop skills of social interaction, which may in turn improve intellectual ability...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend {{in some of the}} world’s most {{advanced}} western democracies of entrusting certain “framework” aspects of court administration to independent judicial agencies. This trend was highlighted in my recent study of the models of court administration, in which I examined court governance systems in seven Australian and international jurisdictions. This article will focus on the reasons behind the establishment of such agencies and the need for judges and policy makers to <b>clearly</b> <b>identify</b> the problems, <b>aims</b> and drivers for reform before embarking on a mission to adopt a particular “model. ” At first, this may seem like an obvious proposition; however, recent experience in overseas jurisdictions demonstrates that {{it is not easy to}} reach a consensus on even the most basic issues affecting the administration of justice in courts. </span...|$|R
40|$|From being {{essentially}} a rural area, {{during the last}} decade the ASEAN has undergone an intense process of industrialization that, even if still fragmented, reshaped the region. The liberalization of trade and services, the inflows of investments and the idea of a common market and of a common productive basis to be realized within 2015 strengthened the economic integration process of the region (Paganetto, 2012). During the recent downturn of the world economy, the ASEAN countries continued to grow, and they acquired the reputation of engines of the global economy. But the economic features that made the ASEAN economy resistant to the crisis and capable of playing such a positive role on the international scene are still to be <b>clearly</b> <b>identified.</b> The <b>aim</b> of this research is that of providing an answer to the following questions: -	Which are the main features of the extraordinary process of growth activated in ASEAN? -	Did the economic growth contributed to strengthen the regional integration process? -	At sectorial level, which relationships occur among value added, employment, productivity and wages? -	It is possible to highlight sectorial and territorial effects in the analysis of the main industrial relations estimated?...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{privatization}} of the agricultural extension service in the Netherlands {{and the need for}} a more market oriented approach, the agricultural innovation system "REE" (from Research through Extension and Education to farmers), no longer seems to provide a suitable response to the complex social changes faced by the agricultural sector. The research programme "Networks in Livestock Farming" can be seen as an experiment aimed at giving a new shape to the interaction between practice, research and policy and thus increasing the self-solving ability of farmers and encouraging innovation in livestock farming in the Netherlands. In 2004, 50 networks of livestock farmers were facilitated by 35 project directors from Wageningen University and Research Center (WUR). This paper describes the experiences and results after six months of "working with net-works". The authors recommend to <b>clearly</b> <b>identify</b> the <b>aims</b> (with regard to content and/or process) that form the basis for the research programme. Clear choices and definitions of the aimes of the research programme must have consequences for both the nature of the networks to be supported {{and the nature of the}} support to be offered, which affects the selection criteria to be applied.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{that the increase in}} amino acid flux and derived protein synthesis rates observed in weight-losing cancer patients may contribute to an ongoing negative energy balance. The mediators and tissues responsible for such apparent increased protein synthesis have not been <b>clearly</b> <b>identified.</b> The <b>aim</b> {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between protein synthetic rates in whole-body, skeletal muscle, and circulating cortisol concentrations in healthy subjects (n = 6) and cancer patients with evidence of an inflammatory response (n = 6). Protein synthetic rates were measured with a primed continuous 20 -h infusion of [15 N]glycine. Skeletal muscle was biopsied at laparotomy. Serum cortisol, resting energy expenditure, plasma proteins, nitrogen metabolites in urine, and skeletal muscle free amino acids were also measured. Derived whole-body and skeletal muscle protein synthetic rates in the cancer group were increased significantly (by 70 and 93 %, respectively, p &# 60; 0. 05). Circulating concentrations of cortisol, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein were also significantly increased in the cancer group and indicated the presence of an inflammatory response. However, there was no significant increase in resting energy expenditure. Mechanisms by which apparent increases in whole-body and skeletal protein synthesis do not result in an increase in resting energy expenditure are discussed. We conclude that glycine utilization is increased in cancer patients but that rates of protein synthesis derived from [15 N]glycine kinetics may not be valid in such patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} coast of Dominican Republic {{is a very}} populated region, with several important cities including Santo Domingo, its capital. Important activities {{are rooted in the}} {{southern coast}} including tourism, industry, commercial ports, and, energy facilities, among others. According to historical reports, it has been impacted by big earthquakes accompanied by tsunamis as in Azua in 1751 and recently Pedernales in 2010, but their sources are not <b>clearly</b> <b>identified.</b> The <b>aim</b> of the present work is to develop a numerical tool to simulate the impact in the southern coast of the Dominican Republic of tsunamis generated in the Caribbean Sea. This tool, based on the Tsunami-HySEA model from EDANYA group (University of Malaga, Spain), could be used in the framework of a Tsunami Early Warning Systems due the very short computing times when only propagation is computed or it could be used to assess inundation impact, computing inundation with a initial 5 meter resolution. Numerical results corresponding to three theoretical sources are used to test the numerical tool. This research has been partially supported by the Spanish Government Research project SIMURISK (MTM 2015 - 70490 -C 2 - 1 -R), the Junta de Andalucía research project TESELA (P 11 -RNM 7069), and Universidad de Málaga, Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tech.

40|$|Scholarly {{literature}} suggests digital marketing skills gaps in industry, but these skills gaps are not <b>clearly</b> <b>identified.</b> The research <b>aims</b> to specify any digital marketing skills gaps encountered by professionals working in communication industries. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 20 communication industry professionals. A focus group followed, testing the rigour of the data. We {{find that a}} lack of specific technical skills; a need for best practice guidance on evaluation metrics, and a lack of intelligent futureproofing for dynamic technological change and development are skills gaps currently challenging the communication industry. However, the challenge of integrating digital marketing approaches with established marketing practice emerges as the key skills gap. Emerging from the key findings, a Digital Marketer Model was developed, highlighting the key competencies and skills needed by an excellent digital marketer. The research concludes that guidance on best practice, focusing upon evaluation metrics, futureproofing and strategic integration, needs to be developed for the communication industry. The Digital Marketing Model should be subject to further testing in industry and academia. Suggestions for further research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Fatty {{liver disease}} {{is one of}} the most common {{diseases}} in postmenopausal women. While regular exercise can decrease the complication of this disease, it has not been <b>clearly</b> <b>identified.</b> Thus, we <b>aimed</b> to investigate the effect of 6 -weeks of aerobic training on Alanine transaminase, Aspartate Aminotransphrase and Alkaline phosphatase changes in menopausal women. Material and Methods: In this Semi-empirical study, 20 postmenopausal women were randomly divided into equal experimental and control groups. The experimental group participated in a controlled aerobic training at 40 - 60 percent of maximal heart rate. The program was the three training sessions per week (45 - 60 minutes) for six weeks. By being fast for 12 hours, blood samples were taken before and after 6 weeks. Results: After six weeks, the level of Alanine transaminase, Aspartate Aminotransphrase and Alkaline phosphatase decreased significantly in experimental group (p< 0. 05), in contrast with control group. Also, there were no significant changes in the baseline characteristic of participants, liver enzymes level and lipid profile between experimental and control groups. Conclusion: The findings showed that six-weeks of aerobic training can diminish liver enzymes but it has not any effect on lipid level.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the kidney}} and the urinary tract (CAKUTs) are relatively common birth defects. The combined prevalence in Europe was 3. 3 per 1000 in 2012. The {{risk factors for}} these anomalies are not <b>clearly</b> <b>identified.</b> The <b>aims</b> of our study were to calculate the birth prevalences of urinary malformations in Murmansk County during 2006 to 2011 and to investigate related prenatal risk factors. METHODS: The Murmansk County Birth Registry was {{the primary source of}} information and our study included 50, 936 singletons in the examination of structure, prevalence and proportional distribution of CAKUTs. The multivariate analyses of risk factors involved 39, 322 newborns. RESULTS: The prevalence of CAKUTs was 4. 0 per 1000 newborns (95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 4 - 4. 5) and did not change during the study period. The most prevalent malformation was congenital hydronephrosis (14. 2 % of all cases). Diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes (odds ratio [OR][*]=[*] 4. 77; 95 % CI, 1. 16 - 19. 65), acute infections while pregnant (OR[*]=[*] 1. 83; 95 % CI, 1. 14 - 2. 94), the use of medication during pregnancy (OR[*]=[*] 2. 03; 95 % CI, 1. 44 - 2. 82), and conception during the summer (OR[*]=[*] 1. 75; 95 % CI 1. 15 - 2. 66) were significantly associated with higher risk of CAKUTs. CONCLUSION: The overall fourfold enhancement of the occurrence of urinary malformations in Murmansk County for the 2006 to 2011 period showed little annual dependence. During pregnancy, use of medications, infections, pre-existing diabetes mellitus, or gestational diabetes were associated with increased risk of these anomalies, as was conception during summer. Our findings have direct applications in improving prenatal care in Murmansk County and establishing targets for prenatal screening and women's consultations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlthough {{emotional}} stress {{is associated with}} ischemic heart disease (IHD) and related clinical events, sex-specific differences in the psychobiological response to mental stress have not been <b>clearly</b> <b>identified.</b> ObjectivesWe <b>aimed</b> to study the differential psychological and cardiovascular responses to mental stress between male and female patients with stable IHD. MethodsPatients with stable IHD enrolled in the REMIT (Responses of Mental Stress–Induced Myocardial Ischemia to Escitalopram) study underwent psychometric assessments, transthoracic echocardiography, and platelet aggregation studies at baseline and after 3 mental stress tasks. Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) was defined as the development or worsening of regional wall motion abnormality, reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)  ≥ 8 % by transthoracic echocardiography, and/or ischemic ST-segment change on electrocardiogram during 1  or more of the 3 mental stress tasks. ResultsIn the 310 participants with known IHD (18 % women, 82 % men), most baseline characteristics were similar {{between women and men}} (including heart rate, blood pressure, and LVEF), although women {{were more likely to be}} nonwhite, living alone (p < 0. 001), and unmarried (p < 0. 001); they also had higher baseline depression and anxiety (p <  0. 05). At rest, women had heightened platelet aggregation responses to serotonin (p = 0. 007) and epinephrine (p = 0. 004) compared with men. Following mental stress, women had more MSIMI (57 % vs. 41 %; p < 0. 04), expressed more negative (p = 0. 02) and less positive emotion (p < 0. 001), and demonstrated higher collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation responses (p = 0. 04) than men. Men were more likely than women to show changes in traditional physiological measures, such as blood pressure (p < 0. 05) and double product. ConclusionsIn this exploratory analysis, we identified clear, measurable, and differential responses to mental stress in women and men. Further studies should test the association of sex differences in cardiovascular and platelet reactivity in response to mental stress and long-term outcomes.

MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL and four other databases were searched for lifestyle intervention studies (diet or exercise or both) in post-partum women (within 12 months of delivery) published up to July 2014. The primary outcome was weight loss. Subgroup analyses were conducted for self-monitoring, individual or group setting, intervention duration, intervention types, {{the use of technology}} as a support, and home- or centre-based interventions. From 12, 673 studies, 46 studies were included in systematic review and 32 randomized controlled trials were eligible for meta-analysis (1, 892 women, age 24 - 36 years). Studies with self-monitoring had significantly greater weight lost than those without (- 4. 61  kg [- 7. 08, - 2. 15] vs. - 1. 34  kg [- 1. 66, - 1. 02], P =  0. 01 for subgroup differences). Diet and physical activity when combined were significantly more effective on weight loss compared with physical activity alone (- 3. 24  kg [- 4. 59, - 1. 90] vs. - 1. 63  kg [- 2. 16, - 1. 10], P <  0. 001 for subgroup differences).
