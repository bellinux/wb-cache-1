40|$|The {{importance}} of collocations {{for success in}} language learning is widely recognized. <b>Concordancers,</b> originally <b>designed</b> for linguists, {{are among the most}} popular tools for students to obtain, organize, and study collocations derived from corpora. This paper describes the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> development of a collocation learning system that is built from Wikipedia text and provides language learners with an easy-to-use interface for looking up collocations of any word that occurs in Wikipedia. The use of this corpus exposes learners to contemporary, content-related text, and enables them to search for semantically related words for a given topic. The system organizes collocations by syntactic pattern, sorts them by frequency, and links them to their original context. The paper includes a practical user guide to illustrate how to use the system as a language aid to facilitate academic writing...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{the use of}} {{parallel}} concordancers in the classroom has been a largely unexplored area. As a result, there are few guidelines {{on the design of}} these tools or the functions they should offer. Also, the number of fully-developed parallel concordance tools is surprisingly few, and most of these are designed for use by corpus linguists and translators. In this paper, we describe a novel, web-based, parallel <b>concordancer</b> <b>designed</b> specifically for use by beginner-level second and foreign language learners of English. The software is built using standard web application tools, such as Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, and thus can run in most university server environments. It is also designed on a similar architecture to the Google search engine, allowing it to work comfortably on very large corpora of hundreds of millions of words. To enable the smooth processing of both English and non-English texts, the concordancer is built to Unicode standards. Its internal token definition settings also employ Unicode character classes meaning that no cumbersome user-defined settings are necessary. Preliminary results show that the new software is considerably faster and easier to use than standard desktop parallel concordance programs. Also, because the tool is web-based, it can be accessed outside of class time, thus allowing students more time for hypothesis-verification and production activities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> {{structure}} matrix (DSM) are two popular design methods at the moment, {{while most}} related researches only apply the basic ideas of axiomatic design or DSM to some cases. This paper first analyses the disadvantages of both axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM. After deep investigations, the paper then puts forward {{that there are}} strong complementarities between axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM. Based on the complementarities between axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM, it is proposed that axiomatic design’s design matrix (DM) can be transformed into corresponding DSM for structural evaluation. In this way, axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM can benefit from each other. The logic of integration between axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM is interpreted in this paper. A computer aided conceptual design system has been developed to enable the integration of axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM...|$|R

40|$|Outsourcing <b>design</b> <b>and</b> {{engineering}} {{tasks in}} product development is increasingly popular. However, firms that outsource <b>design</b> <b>and</b> engineering tasks often experience problems.

This paper identifies the limits of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> engineering outsourcing in product development, and the sources of these limits. To do so, it investigates the organizational challenges that a major European automotive manufacturer faced when it decided to adopt an extreme form of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> engineering outsourcing. Based on an in-depth case study, we identify the sources of problems with outsourcing <b>design</b> <b>and</b> engineering tasks in product development, and {{shed light on the}} limits of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> engineering outsourcing in product development...|$|R

40|$|Book synopsis: <b>Design</b> <b>and</b> Anthropology {{challenges}} conventional thinking {{regarding the}} nature of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> creativity, {{in a way that}} acknowledges the improvisatory skills and perceptual acuity of people. Combining theoretical investigations and documentation of practice based experiments, it addresses methodological questions concerning the re-conceptualisation of the relation between <b>design</b> <b>and</b> use from both theoretical and practice-based positions. Concerned with what it means to draw 'users' into processes of <b>designing</b> <b>and</b> producing this book emphasises the creativity of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> the emergence of objects in social situations and collaborative endeavours. Organised around the themes of perception and the user-producer, skilled practices of <b>designing</b> <b>and</b> using, and the relation between people and things, the book contains the latest work of researchers from academia and industry, to enhance our understanding of ethnographic practice and develop a research agenda for the emergent field of design anthropology. Drawing together work from anthropologists, philosophers, designers, engineers, scholars of innovation <b>and</b> theatre practitioners, <b>Design</b> <b>and</b> Anthropology will appeal to anthropologists and to those working in the fields of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> innovation, and the philosophy of technology and engineering...|$|R
