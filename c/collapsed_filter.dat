40|$|The {{selectivity}} filter of the KcsA K+ channel has two typical conformations-the conductive and {{the collapsed}} conformations, respectively. The {{transition from the}} conductive to the <b>collapsed</b> <b>filter</b> conformation can represent the process of inactivation that depends on many environmental factors. Water molecules permeating behind the filter can influence the <b>collapsed</b> <b>filter</b> stability. Here we perform the molecular dynamics simulations to study {{the stability of the}} <b>collapsed</b> <b>filter</b> of the KcsA K+ channel under the different water patterns. We find that the water patterns are dynamic behind the <b>collapsed</b> <b>filter</b> and the filter stability increases with the increasing number of water molecules. In addition, the stability increases significantly when water molecules distribute uniformly behind the four monomeric filter chains, and the stability is compromised if water molecules only cluster behind one or two adjacent filter chains. The altered filter stabilities thus suggest that the <b>collapsed</b> <b>filter</b> can inactivate gradually under the dynamic water patterns. We also demonstrate how the different water patterns affect the filter recovery from the collapsed conformation...|$|E
40|$|Title of the communication: The Gödel Paradox and Wittgenstein's ReasonNational audienceI {{provide an}} {{interpretation}} of Wittgenstein's much criticized remarks on Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem {{in the light of}} paraconsistent arithmetics: in taking Gödel's proof as a paradoxical derivation, Wittgenstein was right, given his deliberate rejection of the standard distinction between theory and metatheory. The reasoning behind the proof of the truth of the Gödel sentence is then performed within the formal system itself, which turns out to be inconsistent. I show that the models of paraconsistent arithmetics (obtained via the Meyer-Mortensen <b>collapsing</b> <b>filter</b> on the standard model) match with many intuitions underlying Wittgensteins philosophy of mathematics, such as its strict finitism and the insistence on the decidability of any meaningful mathematical question...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging of the visual cor-tex with an in-plane resolution of 0. 4 3 0. 4 mm 2 was performed using a simple visual stimulus resulting in clear maps of activation. A <b>collapsing</b> <b>filter</b> {{was used to compare}} these high-resolution images with low-resolution images collected during the same session. A good correspondence between the high- and low-resolution functional maps was found with respect to the center of localization of activa-tion. However, only 20 % of the size of activated areas in the low-resolution experiment was observed at high resolu-tion, which was partly caused by the difference in signal-to-noise ratio. The high-resolution images produce signal changes much higher than the low-resolution images due to reduced partial volume effects. Additionally, the high-resolution functional maps were compared with detailed anatomical and venous information. The activated areas were predominantly observed at venous vessels within the sulci with a diameter on the order of the pixel size...|$|R
40|$|A pattern {{recognition}} and track reconstruction procedure {{based on the}} Kalman filter technique has been developed for a straw tube tracking detector for lepton flavor violation experiments (µ → e conversion, µ → e+γ, µ → 3 e). The proposed tracking detector consists {{of a set of}} identical chambers. A simple reconfiguration of the chambers allows meeting requirements for all three experiments. The {{pattern recognition}} proceeds in two stages. At the first stage only hit straw tube center coordinates, without drift time information, are used to reduce the background to a manageable level. At the second stage the drift time information is incorporated and a deterministic annealing filter is applied to reach the final level of background suppression. The final track momentum reconstruction is provided by a combinatorial <b>collapse</b> <b>filter</b> which is effective in hit-to-track assignment. The momentum resolution of the tracker in measuring monochromatic leptons is found to be σp = 0. 17 and 0. 26 MeV for the µ → e conversion and µ + → e + + γ processes, respectively. The tracker reconstruction resolution for the total scalar lepton momentum is σp = 0. 33 MeV for the µ → 3 e process. ...|$|R

40|$|Permeant ions {{can have}} {{significant}} effects on ion channel conformational changes. To further {{understand the relationship}} between ion occupancy and gating conformational changes, we have studied macroscopic and single-channel gating of BK potassium channels with different permeant monovalent cations. While the slopes of the conductance–voltage curve were reduced with respect to potassium for all permeant ions, BK channels required stronger depolarization to open only when thallium was the permeant ion. Thallium also slowed the activation and deactivation kinetics. Both the change in kinetics and the shift in the GV curve were dependent on the thallium passing through the permeation pathway, {{as well as on the}} concentration of thallium. There was a decrease in the mean open time and an increase in the number of short flicker closing events with thallium as the permeating ion. Mean closed durations were unaffected. Application of previously established allosteric gating models indicated that thallium specifically alters the opening and closing transition of the channel and does not alter the calcium activation or voltage activation pathways. Addition of a closed flicker state into the allosteric model can account for the effect of thallium on gating. Consideration of the thallium concentration dependence of the gating effects suggests that the flicker state may correspond to the <b>collapsed</b> selectivity <b>filter</b> seen in crystal structures of the KcsA potassium channel under the condition of low permeant ion concentration...|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the Perozo group {{proposed}} a mechanistic {{explanation for the}} effects of voltage fields on KcsA gating. After adding a depolarizing current to the channel, the reorientation of Glu71 towards the intracellular pore occurs, thereby disrupting the Glu71-Asp80 carboxyl-carboxylate pair that initially stabilizes the selectivity <b>filter.</b> The <b>collapse</b> of the <b>filter</b> region prevents entry into or facilitate exit from the inactivated state. Glu71, {{a key part of the}} selectivity filter signature sequence that is conserved among K+ ion channels, plays a pivotal role in gating as its ability to reorient itself in the direction of the transmembrane voltage field is able to provide an explanation for voltage gating events in KcsA. The orientation of amino acids in the filter region might play significant physiological role in modulating potassium fluxes in eukaryotes and prokaryotes under steady-state conditions.|$|R
40|$|Ca 2 +/calmodulin- and voltage-dependent {{inactivation}} (CDI and VDI) comprise vital prototypes of Ca 2 + channel modulation, {{rich with}} biological consequences. Although the events initiating CDI and VDI are known, their downstream mechanisms have eluded consensus. Competing proposals include hinged-lid occlusion of channels, selectivity <b>filter</b> <b>collapse,</b> and allosteric inhibition of the activation gate. Here, novel theory predicts that perturbations of channel activation should alter inactivation in distinctive ways, {{depending on which}} hypothesis holds true. Thus, we systematically mutate the activation gate, formed by all S 6 segments within CaV 1. 3. These channels feature robust baseline CDI, and the resulting mutant library exhibits significant diversity of activation, CDI, and VDI. For CDI, a clear and previously unreported pattern emerges: activation-enhancing mutations proportionately weaken inactivation. This outcome substantiates an allosteric CDI mechanism. For VDI, the data implicate a “hinged lid–shield” mechanism, similar to a hinged-lid process, with a previously unrecognized feature. Namely, we detect a “shield” in CaV 1. 3 channels that is specialized to repel lid closure. These findings reveal long-sought downstream mechanisms of inactivation and may furnish a framework for the understanding of Ca 2 + channelopathies involving S 6 mutations...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{demonstrate}} {{the feasibility of}} direct angioscopic visualization of an optional inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in situ and during retrieval. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Angioscopy was used for direct visualization of optional IVC filters in six sheep. Cavograms were obtained before the filters were retrieved. After successful filter retrieval, segmental IVC perfusion was performed to evaluate filter retrieval-related damage to the IVC wall. Therefore, all branch vessels were ligated before the IVC segment was flushed with normal saline solution until it was fully distended. Then, the inflow was terminated and the IVC segment observed for deflation. Subsequently, the IVC was harvested en bloc, dissected, and inspected macroscopically. RESULTS: The visibility of IVC filters at angioscopy was excellent. During the retrieval procedure, <b>filter</b> <b>collapse</b> and retraction into the sheath were clearly demonstrated. Angioscopy provided additional information to that obtained with cavography, demonstrating adherent material in three filters. Three filters in place for more than 2 months could not be retrieved because the filter legs were incorporated into the IVC wall. After filter retrieval, there was no perforation at segmental IVC perfusion. At macroscopic inspection of the IVC lumen, {{a small piece of}} detached endothelium was found in one animal. CONCLUSION: Angioscopy enabled the direct evaluation of optional IVC filters in situ and during retrieval. Compared with cavography, angioscopy provided additional information about the filter in situ and the retrieval procedure. Future applications of this technique could include studies of filter migration, compression, and clot-trapping efficacy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use of {{inferior}} vena cava (IVC) filter for massive pulmonary emboli (PE) with cardiopulmonary instability has {{not been}} clinically studied. We present a case series of six such patients who received an IVC filter with anticoagulation rather than thrombolysis because of high risk of bleeding. Acute pulmonary embolectomy was considered, but was not possible {{for a variety of}} individual clinical situations. These six hospitalized patients prospectively followed during their admission. They were triaged to three medical intensive care units (ICUs) and one surgical ICU in three university teaching hospitals. One patient was transferred from another institution. All six patients had severe hypoxia and tenuous cardiopulmonary status. All required high inspiratory oxygen and hemodynamic support; two required mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. An IVC filter was placed emergently and anticoagulation was started immediately. All six patients had resolution of pulmonary thromboemboli (PTE) on anticoagulation while the IVC filter prevented further PE. All six patients were discharged home in their pre-critical illness state. None of the patients suffered complications from this therapy and had excellent resolution of cardiopulmonary <b>collapse.</b> The IVC <b>filter</b> placement prevented further major embolic events while the PTE resolved with anticoagulation. An IVC filter should be considered as an adjunct to anticoagulation therapy for those patients with massive PE and cardiopulmonary instability who are not candidates for thrombolysis, and acute pulmonary embolectomy is not readily available or is of very high risk...|$|R
40|$|A {{new class}} of {{ensemble}} filters, called the Diffuse Ensemble Filter (DEnF), is proposed in this paper. The DEnF assumes that the forecast errors orthogonal to the first guess ensemble are uncorrelated with the latter ensemble and have infinite variance. The assumption of infinite variance corresponds to the limit of "complete lack of knowledge" and differs dramatically from the implicit assumption made in most other ensemble filters, {{which is that the}} forecast errors orthogonal to the first guess ensemble have vanishing errors. The DEnF is independent of the detailed covariances assumed in the space orthogonal to the ensemble space, and reduces to conventional ensemble square root filters when the number of ensembles exceeds the model dimension. The DEnF is well defined only in data rich regimes and involves the inversion of relatively large matrices, although this barrier might be circumvented by variational methods. Two algorithms for solving the DEnF, namely the Diffuse Ensemble Kalman Filter (DEnKF) and the Diffuse Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (DETKF), are proposed and found to give comparable results. These filters generally converge to the traditional EnKF and ETKF, respectively, when the ensemble size exceeds the model dimension. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the DEnF eliminates <b>filter</b> <b>collapse,</b> which occurs in ensemble Kalman filters for small ensemble sizes. Also, the use of the DEnF to initialize a conventional square root filter dramatically accelerates the spin-up time for convergence. However, in a perfect model scenario, the DEnF produces larger errors than ensemble square root filters that have covariance localization and inflation. For imperfect forecast models, the DEnF produces smaller errors than the ensemble square root filter with inflation. These experiments suggest that the DEnF has some advantages relative to the ensemble square root filters in the regime of small ensemble size, imperfect model, and copious observations...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 51 - 64 Current {{technologies}} {{now make}} it possible to build turbomachinery without the need for a lubrication and seal oil system. However, there is an established machinery population that still requires support systems for oil wetted bearings and seals. For most companies, it is not economically practical to convert to new bearings and seals to eliminate the oil support system. Indeed, {{this may not be the}} best solution in many cases. Lubrication and seal oil systems can be the single largest cause of spurious and nuisance trips. In most cases, such trips are due to controller degradation, improper operation, or simple neglect. The most common causes of oil system problems, and practical solutions aimed at long term operating reliability are addressed. A chronic cause of spurious trips is oil pump switchover. Usually, such problems can be eliminated by upgrading controllers and/or control valve selection philosophy, installation of hydraulic pulsation dampeners, a design audit of the piping configuration, and, very often, operating procedures. Oil system instability contributes significantly to nuisance trips. Again, a review of system control components and associated hardware can usually minimize this phenomenon. Additionally, improper purging of air has been known to cause similar problems, and frustrate the most experienced operator. There are other problems which can also result in unscheduled downtime of critical rotating machinery. These include <b>collapsing</b> oil <b>filter</b> elements, improper sour seal oil drainer sizing, improper control valve sizing, lack of attention to transient conditions, controller and pressure switch physical location, and oil cooler integrity, to name a few. There is a large installed machinery population that has been in operation for many years, but has never been upgraded to present standards. New developments in control technology lend themselves to increasing oil system reliability, in addition to other component upgrades. Refineries and chemical plants now commonly utilize comprehensive preventive maintenance (PM) programs; however, oil systems do not seem to be included in such programs to the same level as that of their supported machinery. Oil system reliability can be increased, and nuisance trips minimized, by monitoring several key operating points which include valve position, oil temperature and chemical analysis, and filter differential pressure (to name a few) on a scheduled basis. Such data can also be useful in determining or predicting problems with the rotating equipment. It has also become obvious in recent years that process demands, in addition to efforts to improve oil system reliability, have resulted in systems that are more complex. Such complexity has, in some cases, ironically decreased operational reliability due to the introduction of unnecessary hardware. Practical and realistic basic design guidelines will be presented, along with a comparison of the various design philosophies currently being utilized in the industry...|$|R
40|$|The prototypical prokaryotic channel, KcsA, is {{model system}} for {{mammalian}} potassium channels. This thesis describes solid-state NMR {{studies of the}} conformational dynamics involved in ion binding and channel inactivation. Our studies are conducted on the full-length wildtype channel incorporated into native-like lipid bilayers. We focus on the selectivity filter, which is a key conserved region across all potassium channels and {{is responsible for the}} selective passage of potassium ions across cellular membranes. KcsA is known to alter the structure of its pore {{as a function of the}} ambient potassium level; at high potassium the selectivity filter adopts a conductive state with high ion occupancy and at low potassium it collapses into a non conductive state with reduced ion occupancy. We report solid-state NMR resonance assignments for ~ 200 15 N and 13 C atoms in KcsA using two and three dimensional correlation spectroscopy. Using the assignments we characterize the conductive and collapsed states of the selectivity filter and show that the transition between the states occurs at a potassium concentration of 1 - 15 micromolar. We interpret the shape of the binding curves in terms of the complex equilibria involved in the structural <b>collapse</b> of the <b>filter.</b> Our results describe the detailed structural and kinetic landscape of the selectivity <b>filter</b> as it <b>collapses</b> at low potassium. To gain more mechanistic insight into the physiological role of the collapsed state, we conduct studies of an inactivation resistant mutant of KcsA, E 71 A. C-type inactivation is the potassium and voltage dependent closure of the outer mouth of the channel and is a clinically important process in mammalian potassium channels. We show that the collapsed state is similar to the inactivated state in terms of structure and chemical shifts, which establishes that inactivation processes can be studied by lowering the ambient potassium level. We also use site-specific chemical shift tensor measurements, to show that glutamic acid 71 is protonated at neutral pH and therefore must have an abnormally high pKa (< 7. 5). Our studies clarify a previous inconsistency in the literature regarding the pKa of E 71 and propose a new model for the role of E 71 in channel inactivation. The results have led to insights into the molecular factors that stabilize the collapsed or inactivated state of the channel, and firmly establish KcsA as a model membrane protein system for future studies of structure and dynamics by solid state NMR...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{metal filters}} are {{manufactured}} from perforated plate {{and one or}} more layers of woven wire mesh. The perforated plate forms the support portion of the filter, and delivers the overall strength of the filter to withstand operational pressures. The woven wire mesh forms the filter portion with the aperture size chosen to suit the required level of filtration. An ideal filter would have the maximum open area possible to minimise the filters’ resistance when in situ in the conduit. However maximising the open area decreases the overall strength of the filter and so open area must be compromised to deliver the required strength. The design freedoms and capabilities of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology provides the opportunity to design novel filter media that are depth filters with x-, y- and z- planes with integrated support portion and filter portion. This filter mesh has a defined aperture size and by reducing the equivalent wire diameter, these novel filter media have a greater open area compared to the equivalent woven wire mesh. This potentially reduces the pressure drop across the filter and so reduces pumping energy requirements. In preliminary studies AM filter media have been designed using a repeating node unit to form the latticework of the AM filters. Previous test samples demonstrated that this AM integrated filter support and filter portion design decreased the pressure drop across the filter compared to conventional filter design. The aim is to develop the integrated support and filter AM design to incorporate different sizes of repeating nodes, with a larger node providing strength and the smaller node providing the filtration level. It has been possible to develop two node structures to deliver two latticeworks, one with a 1000 μm aperture {{and the other with}} 500 μm aperture. Filter disks comprising of 1, 2 and 3 layers of the individual nodes were tested for strength by <b>collapse</b> pressure. Conical <b>filters</b> were designed and tested for each individual node and for combination of nodes, i. e. layer of 500 μm and 1000 μm. These AM integrated filter supports and filter portion conical filters were tested for strength: collapse pressure and their pressure drop. The pressure drop across these novel AM integrated filters was largest for the AM 500 μm aperture filter alone and least in the AM 1000 μm filter. Combination of repeating nodes of both 1000 μm and 500 μm in one single filter delivered a decreased pressure drop across the filter compared to the AM 500 μm filter with 500 μm apertures alone. The integrated filter support and filter support portion AM design filters shown here have the potential to decrease the end users pumping energy requirements and so reduce energy costs and the end users carbon footprint...|$|R
