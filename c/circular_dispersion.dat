The set of numbers C(ϑ) is called the <b>circular</b> <b>dispersion</b> spectrum.

40|$|A {{switchable}} hyperbolic material (SHM) is investigated, {{with which}} one can turn on or off the hyperbolic dispersion of the material via magnetic control. The SHM has simple structure, with a one-dimensional periodic stacking of dielectric layer and gyromagnetic layer. The hyperbolic dispersion of SHM {{is due to the}} negative effective permeability of gyromagnetic layers, and it can be transformed into a regular <b>circular</b> <b>dispersion</b> when the d. c. magnetic field is switched off. This switchable dispersion transition is reversible, which may have great potential applications in many fields...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{quantities}} {{referring to}} angles, like vector direction, color hue e. t. c. exhibit an inherently periodic nature. Due to this periodicity, digital filters and edge operators proposed for {{data on the}} line cannot be applied on such data. In this paper we introduce filters for angular signals (circular mean, circular median, circular a-trimmed mean, circular modified trimmed mean). Particular emphasis {{is given to the}} circular median filter for which some interesting properties are derived. We also use estimators of <b>circular</b> <b>dispersion</b> to introduce edge detectors for angular signals. Three variations for the extension of quasi-range to circular data are proposed and expressions for their output pdf are derived. These "circular" quasi-ranges have good and user-controlled properties as edge detectors in noisy angular signals. The performance of the proposed edge operators is evaluated on angular edges, using certain quantitative criteria. Finally, a series of experiments featuring 1 -D [...] ...|$|E

For perturbations to the system propagating normal to the plane of <b>circular</b> polarization, a <b>dispersion</b> relation is derived employing an expansion in the nonlinear wave amplitude and {{the momentum of the}} plasma particles in the plane of polarization. Instability results both in the absence and presence of a large-scale magnetic field with a growth rate of the order of the nonlinear wave amplitude...|$|R
40|$|Dispersion remains, today, {{a highly}} topical subject. Our {{group has been}} {{interested}} in characterizing this phenomenon by pulsed-field-gradient NMR technique. Direct measurement of the dispersion coefficient {{can be done with}} a Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) sequence by assuming that the asymptotic regime is reached. In unsteady state, the propagator formalism is used. To better understand these measurements, the NMR experiment is modeled using a stochastic simulation (random walks) and compared with experimental results. The comparison is made for the simple case of Poiseuille flow in a <b>circular</b> tube (Taylor-Aris <b>dispersion)</b> ...|$|R

In addition, optical rotary <b>dispersion,</b> <b>circular</b> dichroism, and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis in the presence of chiral shift reagent were used variously to access reaction stereoselectivity, absolute configuration, and optical purity of isolated products. The data indicated that C. decora produced the sulfoxide in high yield (69 %) and optical purity (97 %), most probably in the S-configuration...|$|R
40|$|A {{substantial}} {{control of}} dispersion {{features of the}} hybrid EH 01 and HE 11 modes of a circular waveguide which is completely filled by a longitudinally magnetized composite finely-stratified ferrite-semiconductor structure is discussed. A relation between the resonant conditions of such a composite gyroelectromagnetic filling of the <b>circular</b> waveguide and <b>dispersion</b> features of the supported modes are studied. Three distinct frequency bands with the single-mode operation under normal as well as anomalous dispersion conditions of the EH 01 mode are identified by solving an optimization problem {{with respect to the}} filling factors of the composite medium. The possibility of achieving isolated propagation of the HE 11 mode is revealed. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} we generalize the quantum mechanical model of three coupled oscillators {{because of its}} usage in the crystal optical activity. Using this model we can include the in uence of all essential couplings between single oscillators which represent the molecules or atoms of optically active crystals belonging for example to the space groups of symmetry D 4 3 or D 6 3. The single oscillators are damped and therefore we can include both parts of the optical activity { optical rotatory <b>dispersion</b> and <b>circular</b> dichroism { into computations. We present more universal formulas for description of the above mentioned parts. 1...|$|R
40|$|The VSB- 30 {{vehicle is}} a two-stage, unguided, rail {{launched}} sounding rocket, {{consisting of two}} solid propellant motors, payload, with recovery and service system. By the end of 2010, ten vehicles had already been launched, three from Brazil (AlcÃ¢ntara) and seven from Sweden (Esrange). The objective {{of this paper is}} to give an overview of the main characteristics of the first ten flights of the VSB- 30, with emphasis on performance and trajectory data. The <b>circular</b> 3 Ï <b>dispersion</b> area for payload impact point has around 50 km of radius. In most launchings of such vehicle, the impact of the payload fell within 2 sigma.

40|$|Integral field {{spectroscopy}} {{of galaxies}} at redshift z ∼ 2 has revealed {{a population of}} early-forming, rotationally-supported disks. These high-redshift systems provide a potentially important clue to the formation processes that build disk galaxies in the universe. A particularly well-studied example is the z = 2. 38 galaxy BzK− 15504, which was shown by Genzel et al. (2006) to be a rotationally supported disk {{despite the fact that}} its high star formation rate and short gas consumption timescale require a very rapid acquisition of mass. Previous kinematical analyses have suggested that z ∼ 2 disk galaxies like BzK− 15504 did not form through mergers because their line-of-sight velocity fields display low levels of asymmetry. We perform the same kinematical analysis on a set of simulated disk galaxies formed in gas-rich mergers of the type that may be common at high redshift, and show that the remnant disks display low velocity field asymmetry and satisfy the criteria that have been used to classify high-redshift galaxies as disks observationally. Further, we compare one of our remnants to the bulk properties of BzK− 15504 and show that it has a star formation rate, gas surface density, and a <b>circular</b> velocity-to-velocity <b>dispersion</b> ratio that matches BzK− 15504 remarkably well. We suggest that observations of high-redshift disk galaxies like BzK− 15504 are consistent with the hypothesis that gas-rich mergers {{play an important role in}} disk formation at high redshift.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the dispersion of a buoyant solute in a straight horizontal pipe of <b>circular</b> cross-section where <b>dispersion</b> is affected by molecular diffusion, the laminar flow along the pipe and density currents. Erdogan & Chatwin (1967) have derived an equation for the mean concentration [formula-ommited] of a buoyant solute using a relatively simple asymptotic model, and have predicted that the dispersion induced by buoyancy effects depends on the Péclet number of the flow. In this part of this study an approximate expression is derived for [formula-ommited] from Erdogan & Chatwin 2 ̆ 7 s equation, and an asymptotic form is obtained for the second moment of distributions of buoyant solutes. The examination of the second moment leads to a simple, but important, result: the dispersion induced by density currents at large times is small compared with the dispersion induced by density currents at times when transient effects are significant...|$|R
40|$|Migration {{patterns}} {{across a}} drift fence with pitfall traps were studied between 1997 and 1999 at a breeding pond with populations of great crested newts, Triturus cristatus, and smooth newts, T. vulgaris, at a study site in south-central Sweden. Metamorphs and older newts emigrated from the pond non-randomly {{and seemed to}} avoid exiting where open fields adjoined, but were oriented towards a patch of forest immediately {{to the east of}} the pond. Movement patterns changed slightly over the years, but metamorphs were more dispersed and less concentrated than older newts, and did not choose directions identical to those of older newts. Older great crested and smooth newts showed similar directional orientation. Great crested newt metamorphs dispersed towards both edges of the forest patch, and possible explanations for this are discussed. The results suggest that orientation in relation to cues from the surroundings of a breeding pond may be used by newts to make migratory decisions.

40|$|Insight {{into the}} {{distortion}} of electromagnetic (EM) signals in living tissue {{is important for}} optimising medical applications. To obtain this insight, field calculations {{have been carried out}} for a plane-stratified configuration of air, skin, fat, muscle and bone tissue. In this configuration, an EM field is generated by a prescribed pulsed current in a <b>circular</b> loop. Debye <b>dispersion</b> models have been developed for the description of the permittivity of the tissues. The field problem is solved analytically {{with the aid of a}} temporal Fourier transformation and a spatial Hankel transformation. The corresponding inverse transformations have been carried out numerically. To demonstrate the influences of stratification and dispersion separately, the EM fields in the stratified configuration, in a completely musclefilled space and in vacuum are compared. Two different pulses have been considered; narrow and wide. It emerges that dispersion results in a retardation and an attenuation of the field. Stratification causes additional fluctuations of the time-dependent field. Furthermore, the conductivity of ~ssue at high frequencies is mainly determined by its water content. Tissues with high water content, like muscle and skin, exhibit higher conductivity at high frequencies than fat and bone. Muscle and skin tissue therefore behave as low-pass filters to EM signals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{adsorption}} and insertion kinetics for {{the association}} of two 34 -residue cyclic peptides with phosphocholine membranes have been studied using circular and linear dichroism approaches. The two peptides studied are identical {{with the exception of}} two residues, which are both tyrosine in one of the peptides and tryptophan in the other. Both peptides adopt random coil conformations in solution in the absence of membranes and do not aggregate at concentrations below 20 μM. After addition to liposome <b>dispersions,</b> <b>circular</b> dichroism spectroscopy indicated that both peptides undergo an extremely rapid transformation to a β-conformation that remains unchanged throughout the remainder of the experiment. Linear dichroism (LD) spectroscopy was used to study the kinetics of membrane adsorption and insertion. The data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares approaches, leading to identification of a number of bound states and their corresponding LD spectra. Two pseudo-first order processes could be identified that were common to both peptides. The first occurred with a time constant of the order of 1  min and led to a bound state characterized by weak LD signals, with significant bands corresponding to the transitions of aromatic side chains. The second process occurred with an unusually long time constant of between 75 and 100 min, forming a state with considerably stronger positive LD absorbance in the far-ultraviolet region of the spectrum. For the tyrosine-substituted peptide, a third slow process with a long time constant (76 min) could also be delineated and was attributed to rearrangements of the peptide within the membrane...|$|R
40|$|The pH-dependent {{conformational}} change {{of a type}} K Bence Jones protein (Ta) was studied by circular dichroism (CD) *** * and ultraviolet spectroscopy. The confor-mation of this protein was stable between pH 4 and 10 and was changed as the pH was lowered below pH 4 or raised above 10. From the total change of the molar ex-tinction coefficient upon acid denaturation {{it was suggested that}} two tryptophyl residues of Ta protein are exposed by the denaturation. CD spectra showed that the acid-denatured Ta protein is not randomly coiled but assumes some ordered structure, although the alkali-denatured protein is nearly randomly coiled. Since EDELMAN and GALLY (/) discovered that Bence Jones protein is equivalent to the light polypeptide chain of immunoglobulins, numerous structural studies of these proteins have been carried out. Recently, amino acid sequences of several Bence Jones proteins have been established (2, 3). Studies on the con-formation of Bence Jones proteins in solutions are expected to give important information on the conformation of immunoglobulins. From this point of view, we have investigated the optical rotatory <b>dispersion,</b> <b>circular</b> dichro-ism, and ultraviolet absorption spectrum of Bence Jones proteins (4 — 7). In the present paper, we report studies of the pH dependence of the acid difference spectra and circular dichroic spectra of a type K Bence Jones pro-tein (Ta). In a subsequent paper, states of the ionizable groups of this protein studied by acid-base titration will be described. * Part of this study was carried out at th...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} or physico-chemical methods available {{for studying the}} various properties of chemical compounds. These methods can be conveniently classified into classes which {{are determined by the}} purpose of the investigation. Those used to elucidate molecular structure fall into two classes. The first, which includes x-ray, neutron, and electron diffraction yields detailed information about the whole structure of the molecule. These techniques introduce a metrical element into the understanding of the complex, revealing the lengths of the chemical bonds, the angles between them, and other structural details such as the various forms of isomerism in the topological and conformational arrangements of polydentate ligands about the metal centre. The second gives fragmentary information concerning individual bonds of a particular group of atoms in the molecule. This class includes optical rotatory <b>dispersion,</b> <b>circular</b> dichrosism, the measurement of electric and magnetic moments, and various kinds of spectroscopy of the region ranging from microwave to ultraviolet. The last two groups should yield information mostly {{in the area of the}} electronic structure of the molecule. The last group covers vibrational spectroscopy which originates in the vibrations of the nuclei constituting a molecule. Vibrational spectra are observed both as infrared and Raman spectra, and the frequencies of the vibrational transitions are determined by the masses of the constituent atoms, the molecular geometry and the interatomic forces. The intensities of infrared and Raman spectra are related to the changes in dipole moment and polarisability, respectively. Attempts have been made to analyse the vibrational spectra quantitatively. Though there has been some success, work on many aspects (such as intensity in relation to bonding) is sparse. Nevertheless, the understanding of the molecular and the electronic structure of some molecules can be much extended by employing a combination of methods. This thesis consists of two main sections. The first describes the vibrational spectral studies of diarsine complexes. Most of the spectral work is centred around the low infrared frequency region. Raman spectra of two complexes are reported and characterised by their metal-ligand sensitive absorptions. The frequencies of these assignments are used to calculate the frequencies of the infrared active metal-ligand vibrations. The frequencies assigned to the metal-ligand vibration of diarsine complexes are analysed in terms of the change in electronic configuration of the transition element. It is hoped that the inferences obtained from the vibrational may elucidate the bonding in these complexes. These results are checked against those derived from the data given in x-ray and electron spin resonance (e. s. r.) spectral studies. The second main section gives a description of the crystal and the molecular structure of cobalt triethylenetetramine glycinato dichloride, - 2 '-(RS) -(Co(trien) (gly)) Cl 2. H 2 O. It belongs to a series of cobalt(III) polyamino compounds containing asymmetric nitrogen centres. These polyamino complexes can display various forms of isomerism in their topological and confrontational arrangements. The reasons for the study of this particular complex are many, and are given in the Introduction to Crystal Studies. However, the primary reason is that precise molecular geometry is of great importance as a check on the predicted molecular geometry derived from energy minimisation techniques...|$|R
