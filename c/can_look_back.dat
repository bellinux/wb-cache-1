5|$|Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute {{who at the}} age of 50 <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on {{a varied}} life that has {{included}} a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War. His reputation secure, he lives quietly, on good but not close terms with his neighbours; his Roman Catholicism sets him slightly apart in the local community. He has a pronounced distaste for most aspects of modern life, and has of late become somewhat lazy, given to drinking more than he should. To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold has taken to dosing himself with a powerful sedative of chloral and bromide. He conceals this practice from his doctor.|$|E
500|$|... tall, slim boy, {{straight}} as an arrow. His {{face was a}} perfect oval, his hair was as black as a raven's wing, {{and his eyes were}} large and of that peculiar soft, melting blackness, which excites pity when one is in distress. His skin was a clear, dark olive, bordering on the swarthy, and this, with his high cheek bones, would have led us to suppose that his nationality was different from our own, had we not known that his name was plain Henry P. There was an air of good breeding and refinement about him, that, with his small hands and feet, would have set us to thinking, had it not been that in our youth and intensely enthusiastic natures, we gave no thought to our comrades' personal appearance. We <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> now and see the shy, reserved nature of the boy, the dark, melancholy eyes, the sad smile, the sensitive twitching of the lips.|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at the whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle {{for me to get}} over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E

5000|$|In his summing-up, Pritchard {{said that}} Tarran and Southern had both led {{exemplary}} lives and that Tarran had spent apparently {{the whole of}} his life in the service of his creation. He added that [...] "they <b>can</b> both <b>look</b> <b>back</b> upon their lives with pride".|$|R
500|$|Specter {{received}} several high-profile endorsements {{during the final}} {{weeks leading up to}} the primary. Senator John Kerry, who had been an early supporter of Sestak's 2006 House campaign, endorsed Specter in the Senate race, calling him [...] "fighter and a friend, and I am proud to vouch for his character". The Philadelphia Inquirer called Sestak [...] "a worthy opponent" [...] and said that his determination made the race especially competitive, but ultimately embraced Specter, whose overall career record the newspaper said was [...] "a good choice for Democrats". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also endorsed Specter, focusing more on the fact that Specter stood the best chance of defeating Toomey in a general election challenge. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, however, endorsed Sestak, calling him [...] "incredibly intelligent, thoughtful and articular" [...] while condemning Specter as a [...] "self-serving political ferret" [...] for switching parties. Actor Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, appeared in a television advertisement for Specter, praising the Senator for his long-standing support of stem cell research. Fox said, [...] "In the fight against disease, you <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> or move forward. Arlen Specter is moving forward." [...] President Obama sent e-mail messages to his Organizing for America supporters encouraging them to vote for Specter, However, despite his long position of support for Specter, Obama did not fly to Pennsylvania to actively campaign for the Senator during the campaign's final days.|$|E
500|$|African National Congress {{supporters}} {{gathered in}} Johannesburg {{to celebrate the}} party's results. Jacob Zuma dedicated the ANC's victory to Nelson Mandela.

ANC spokesperson Nkenke Kekana said the ANC was concerned about its drop in support in the 2014 elections. Democratic Alliance leader, Helen Zille, published a press release thanking every South African {{who voted for the}} DA. She said that voters had responded positively to the DA's campaign, saying, [...] "We <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> proudly on what was undoubtedly the biggest and best campaign the DA has ever run." [...] Economic Freedom Fighters commander-in-chief Julius Malema dedicated the EFF's result to the girls kidnapped in the Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping, saying, [...] "It looks impossible, but we have proved what looks impossible is possible." [...] EFF supporters gathered at Innes Free Park in Sandton to celebrate the results. Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi {{said in a statement that}} despite low estimations in the Ipsos polls, the IFP managed to retain its fourth-place position in the elections. Buthelezi thanked all South Africans who voted for the IFP and stated that he was proud to serve South Africa.

2500|$|Shortly {{before her}} death, Binchy told The Irish Times: [...] "I don't {{have any regrets}} about any roads I didn't take. Everything went well, and I think that's been a help because I <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back,</b> and I do get great {{pleasure}} out of looking back... I've been very lucky and I have a happy old age with good family and friends still around." [...] Just before dying, she read her latest short story at the Dalkey Book Festival. She once said {{she would like to}} die [...] "...on my 100th birthday, piloting Gordon and myself into the side of a mountain".|$|E
50|$|Narrative {{point of}} view or {{narrative}} perspective describes {{the position of the}} narrator, that is, the character of the storyteller, in relation to the story being told. It {{can be thought of as}} a camera mounted on the narrator's shoulder that <b>can</b> also <b>look</b> <b>back</b> inside the narrator's mind.|$|R
50|$|Jens-Uwe Beyer <b>can</b> already <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on {{a number}} of live performances, e.g.: Monterrey (Mexico, Aura Club), Thessaloniki (Liebe.!), Porto (Passos Manuell), Amsterdam (Paradiso), Vienna (Icke Micke), Moscow (Solyanka, Propaganda), Hamburg (Übel & Gefährlich), Berlin (Panorama Bar), New York (Bunker), Cambridge (Middlesex Lounge), Tokio (Seco) and London (The End).|$|R

2500|$|In 1947, the Sierra Club Handbook praised Clyde's {{mountaineering}} accomplishments: Outstanding {{among members}} who have helped others gain mountain experience is Norman Clyde, whose amazing achievements in scaling practically all the peaks in the High Sierra are well known to mountaineers. [...] More than one climber has exulted in a supposedly first ascent, only to find later that Clyde went up that [...] "unclimbed peak" [...] in the winter of, say, 1920! [...] There are many seasoned climbers who <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on their early days as novices {{in the mountains and}} remember with gratitude what they learned from Clyde.|$|E
2500|$|Cleckely {{considers}} {{that the concept}} of [...] has much in common with his concept of psychopathy, and argues that it could be considered a mild version if it continues {{for a long time and}} is generalized. He notes that many respectable mature productive citizens <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on short periods of unprovoked social misconduct, including such things as property damage, racism, bestiality, voyeurism, rebellion, and promiscuity. On the other hand, he notes prolonged but prescribed behavioral disorder in the case of a woman who remained for some time [...] "irrationally promiscuous and bisexual", but who had plausible psychological reasons for her behavior and was otherwise functional in her work and life. He also notes he no longer {{considers that}} homosexuality should be classed as sexual psychopathy, on the grounds that many homosexuals seem to be able to live productive lives in society. He considers that sexual fetishes are not particularly consistent with psychopaths, as the latter tend to have weak drives. However, paradoxically, he then states that psychopathy can be associated with particular sadistic drives and often be responsible for the most serious sex crimes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I?" [...] she replied. [...] "Well, I don't know. I <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> now to {{a half-hour}} of my life when I loathed every {{creature}} that could call itself a man." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{parallel}} palette (invented by David Kassan) is {{a palette}} for oil painting, mounted vertically {{adjacent to the}} painting, so that the paints on the palette {{are in the same}} lighting as on the canvas, and so that the artist <b>can</b> <b>look</b> directly <b>back</b> and forth between subject, canvas, and palette.|$|R
50|$|Virtually all Chinese in the Philippines {{belong to}} either the Hokkienese- or Cantonese-speaking groups of the Han Chinese ethnicity.

5000|$|The White House did not {{disclose}} the accident until a press conference on Sunday afternoon. McClellan {{said he did not}} know that Cheney had shot someone until that Sunday morning.

6000|$|In every man's {{life there}} is {{generally}} one moment to which {{in later years}} he <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> and say: [...] "In this moment I fell in love!" [...] Such a moment came to Ashe now.|$|E
60|$|Well, it did decide it, but {{not exactly}} in the way I anticipated. I <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on the whole affair quite calmly now, but I wouldn't live it over again for all the wealth of Ind.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' I pursued. 'I <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> upon my {{part in it}} with a calm, half-smiling {{pity for}} myself as for some other man. But I am he, indeed; and now the chief sorrows of my life are yours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Can I {{never make}} you think of other days than those--of the happier days to come? Or, if you must think {{of the time that}} is passed, <b>can</b> you not <b>look</b> <b>back</b> to the time when I first loved you?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Kaiafas {{announced}} his retirement from football in May 1984, and <b>can</b> now <b>look</b> <b>back</b> on a remarkable career which coincided with the greatest decade in Omonia's history - they were league champions seven times. It is little wonder he refers to the club as [...] "my second family". In 2003, he {{was selected as the}} Golden Player of Cyprus and had the honour of representing his country in UEFA Jubilee Awards.|$|R
5000|$|TouchArcade's Spanner Spencer also responded positively, {{scoring the}} game 4.5 out 5, and arguing [...] "it {{is rife with}} lavish quirks, nods and winks toward {{those of us who}} grew up taking this stuff so seriously, but <b>can</b> now <b>look</b> <b>back</b> at it with a wry and {{friendly}} smile. By casually lampooning itself, He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe is entirely accessible to both the young and old alike." ...|$|R
60|$|I wandered {{about that}} night {{like a man who}} has {{discovered}} his Gods are dead.

6000|$|... 'Then, mother!' said Venetia, 'I {{find that}} I have been misunderstood. At least I thought my {{feelings}} towards yourself had been appreciated. They have not; and I can truly say, my life does not afford a single circumstance to which I <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>back</b> with content. Well will it indeed be {{for me to}} die?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I believe," [...] {{continued}} Olive, [...] "that a retrospect {{love will}} be a better foundation for conjugal happiness than any other sort of affection. One <b>can</b> always <b>look</b> <b>back</b> to it no matter what happens, and be happy in the memory of it. It would be something distinct which could never be interfered with. You can't imagine what an earnest and absorbing love I once had for that man!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{so easy to}} {{be happy}} {{on a day like}} this, isn't it?" [...] Anne was saying, with true Anneish philosophy. [...] "Let's try to make this a really golden day, girls, a day to which we <b>can</b> always <b>look</b> <b>back</b> with delight. We're to seek for beauty and refuse to see {{anything}} else. 'Begone, dull care!' Jane, you are thinking of something that went wrong in school yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} of that," [...] she {{answered}} in a changed voice. [...] "Of course, it may be so, if the passage goes down at all. Well, at least I <b>can</b> <b>look</b> and come <b>back</b> to tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My good young friend, {{you will}} live, I doubt not, to {{be a happy}} one. Happiness is not, as we are apt to fancy, entirely {{dependent}} on these contingencies.

6000|$|... "Who need know?" [...] said Midwinter, calmly. [...] "Happen what may, God is all-merciful, God is all-wise. In {{those words}} your dear old friend once wrote to me.
