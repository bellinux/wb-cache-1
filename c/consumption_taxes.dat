25|$|A {{currency}} transaction tax {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} {{a specific type of}} currency transaction for a specific purpose. This term has been most commonly associated with the financial sector, as opposed to <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes</b> paid by consumers. The most frequently discussed versions of a currency transaction tax are the Tobin tax, Edgar L. Feige's Automated Payment Transaction tax and Spahn tax. The Automated Payment Transaction tax requires that all transactions be taxed regardless of the means of payment. As such, it proposes a unique tax on currency transactions collected at the time currency leaves or enters the banking system. Since each transaction mediated by currency can not be directly taxed, the APT tax proposes a brokerage fee on currency deposits and withdrawals that is some multiple of the flat transaction tax rate applied to all payments made via electronic payments mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|Proposals for {{fundamental}} {{reform of}} the federal tax code are receiving increased attention in the business press and among economic analysts and policymakers. President Bush has identified tax reform as a top priority, calling for a tax system that is “pro-growth, easy to understand, and fair to all. ” Moreover, the President has appointed a commission to consider different approaches to tax reform. One approach might be to improve the current income-based federal tax code, perhaps by broadening the tax base and lowering income-tax rates. However, another approach might be to replace current income taxes altogether with a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax.</b> Switching the federal tax system from an income <b>tax</b> to a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> could have important macroeconomic effects. Most economists believe that switching to a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> could increase saving and real output per person over the long run, although studies differ {{on the size of}} these effects. However, switching to a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> might also require sizable short-run economic adjustments and create challenges for monetary policymakers. Garner analyzes the macroeconomic effects of replacing the current federal tax system with a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax.</b> First, he provides some background on the goals of tax reform and the basic difference between an income <b>tax</b> and a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax.</b> Next, he describes three widely discussed versions of a consumption tax: a national retail sales tax, a value-added tax, and a consumption-type flat tax. Finally, he examines the macroeconomic effects of adopting a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax.</b> All three proposals could raise U. S. output over the long run, but adopting a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> could have sizable transition effects as well. These transition effects could vary depending on which <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> was adopted and how monetary policy responded to the reforms. <b>Consumption</b> (Economics); Taxation; <b>Tax</b> reform...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} discussions on Japanese tax system reform includes how <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> (Value-added tax) system ought to be. Facing issues like depopulation, aging society and large budget deficit, <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> can be an effective source of revenue to secure social security. This article mainly focuses on multiple tax rates and input tax credit methods of Japanese <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> system. Because of regressive nature of <b>consumption</b> <b>tax,</b> tax rate reduction, exemption on foodstuffs or daily necessities, and "invoice-based credit method" under which input tax credit is only allowed with invoice have been largely discussed. There are many difficulties in implementation of multiple tax system. Whereas "invoice-based credit method" would promote transparency of the system, so called "account-based method" of Japanese <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> under which the amount of tax is calculated based on the record of accounting books has advantages that enterprises are motivated to keep correct accounting and eliminate tax accumulation even if an exempt business lies in a transaction chain, and they can reduce cost on work or administration. In light of this, the <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> based on "account-based method" should be discussed further in order to promote reliable and transparent tax system...|$|R
500|$|While {{many economists}} and tax experts support a {{consumption}} tax, problems could arise with using a retail sales tax {{rather than a}} value added tax (VAT). [...] A VAT imposes a tax on the value added at every intermediate step of production, so the goods reach the final consumer {{with much of the}} tax already in the price. The retail seller has little incentive to conceal retail sales, since he has already paid much of the good's tax. Retailers are unlikely to subsidize the consumer's tax evasion by concealing sales. In contrast, a retailer has paid no tax on goods under a sales tax system. This provides an incentive for retailers to conceal sales and engage in [...] "tax arbitrage" [...] by sharing some of the illicit tax savings with the final consumer. [...] Citing evasion, Tim Worstall wrote in Forbes that Europe’s 20-25% <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes</b> simply would not work if they were a sales tax: that’s why they’re all a VAT. [...] Laurence Kotlikoff has stated that the government could compel firms to report, via 1099-type forms, their sales to other firms, which would provide the same records that arise under a VAT. [...] In the United States, a general sales tax is imposed in 45 states plus the District of Columbia (accounting for over 97% of both population and economic output), which proponents argue provides a large infrastructure for taxing sales that many countries do not have.|$|E

This tax would be paid three times: first on wage income, again at the cash register as a sales tax, and yet again by businesses on their sales minus their cost of goods and services. For tax junkies, the first is a flat tax. The second is a retail sales tax and the third a business transfer tax. [...] But they are all <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On {{the issue}} of raising taxes, Petty was a {{definite}} proponent of <b>consumption</b> <b>taxes.</b> He recommended that in general taxes should be just sufficient to meet {{the various types of}} public charges that he listed. They should also be horizontally equitable, regular and proportionate. He condemned poll taxes as very unequal and excise on beer as taxing the poor excessively. He recommended a much higher quality of statistical information, to raise taxes more fairly. Imports should be taxed, but only {{in such a way that}} would put them on a level playing field with domestic produce. A vital aspect of economies at this time was that they were transforming from barter economies to money economies. Linked to this, and aware of the scarcity of money, Petty recommends that taxes be payable in forms other than gold or silver, which he estimated to be less than 1% of national wealth. To him, too much importance was placed on money, 'which is to the whole effect of the Kingdom… not [...] one to 100'.|$|E

40|$|Many {{proposals}} for tax reform would shift {{the base of}} taxation from income to consumption. Two arguments for a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> are frequently made. One, a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> is argued to encourage saving, at least {{more so than the}} current income tax. And two, a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> is often considered a more efficient means of tax collection. In this paper, the merits of these arguments are analyzed. To accomplish this, the present income tax is compared to a generic <b>consumption</b> <b>tax.</b> By definition, a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> does not include non-consumed accretions to wealth in the tax base. Hypothetically, each individual has a savings account where unspent income accumulates. Over the course of the year, all net gains to the account are deducted from wage earnings and net losses to the account added. The resulting total is the individual’s consumption and represents the taxable base. The appropriate tax rate is then applied to the derived annual consumption. All saving is in effect free from taxation. However, the added saving incentive (or lack of disincentive) implicit in a move to a <b>consumption</b> <b>tax</b> may not be as large or effective as anticipated; the current ta...|$|R
2500|$|High {{levels of}} {{conspicuous}} consumption {{may be seen}} as socially undesirable on two grounds; firstly, as it is often associated with high relative income, high levels of conspicuous consumption may be an indicator of high levels of income inequality, which may be found intrinsically or instrumentally objectionable; secondly conspicuous consumption differs from other forms of consumption in that the main reason for the purchase of positional goods is not due to the additional direct utility provided by the goods alleged high quality, but rather the social prestige associated with the consumption of that good. One downside of this search for status is that individual purchases of positional goods may at a social level be self-defeating due to external effects. In this case, the externality is status anxiety, the loss of social status suffered by people whose stock of high-status goods (positional goods) is diminished, in relation to the stocks of other conspicuous consumers, as they increase their consumption of high-status goods and services; effectively, status-seeking is a zero-sum game—by definition, the rise of one person in the social hierarchy can occur only {{at the expense of other}} people. Therefore, the conspicuous consumption of luxury goods and services (positional goods) is an economic loss—like competitive military spending (an arms race), [...] wherein each country must match the military expenditures of other countries in the arms race, or suffer a loss of relative military power. In the case of conspicuous <b>consumption,</b> <b>taxes</b> upon luxury goods diminish societal expenditures on high-status goods, by rendering them more expensive than non-positional goods. In this sense, luxury taxes can be seen as a market failure correcting [...] Pigovian tax—with an apparent negative deadweight loss, these taxes are a [...] more efficient mechanism for increasing revenue than 'distorting' labour or capital taxes.|$|E
