The Tettigoniidae are sometimes known as the long-horned grasshoppers to distinguish them from the other suborder of Orthoptera, the Caelifera or short-horned grasshoppers. Ensifera {{is believed to be}} a more ancient group than Caelifera, with its origins in the Carboniferous period, the split having occurred {{at the end of the}} Permian period. Unlike the Caelifera, the Ensifera contain numerous members that are partially carnivorous, feeding on other insects as well as plants.|$|R

Women's <b>cricket</b> was played in South Africa fairly regularly throughout the beginning of the 20th century, but died out during the Second World War. It was revived in 1949 by a group of enthusiasts, and in 1951 Netta Rheinberg, on behalf of the Women's <b>Cricket</b> Association, suggested that a South Africa Women's <b>Cricket</b> Association be formed, and encouraged the possibility that a series of matches could be played between the two associations. The South Africa & Rhodesian Women's <b>Cricket</b> Association (SA) was officially formed in 1952. At their annual general meeting in January 1955, the SA accepted an invitation from the Women's <b>Cricket</b> Association to join an International Women's <b>Cricket</b> Council that, in addition to South Africa, included England, Australia and New Zealand.

5|$|As {{world opinion}} {{hardened}} against South Africa during the 1960s because of apartheid, international governing bodies in various sports introduced boycotts of South African teams and athletes.

The South African government provoked overseas ire in 1968 when it refused entry to the England <b>cricket</b> team because its proposed tour party included Basil D'Oliveira, a Cape Coloured. Amid the ensuing scandal, Marylebone <b>Cricket</b> Club (which then governed English <b>cricket)</b> called off the tour. Two years later, a tour of England by the South Africa <b>cricket</b> team was cancelled by the English Test and County <b>Cricket</b> Board (TCCB) at a week's notice following public protests and immense pressure from the UK government.
