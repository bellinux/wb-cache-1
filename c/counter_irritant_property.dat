40|$|BACKGROUND: Agricultural {{pesticides}} {{are frequently}} used for crop protection. Residents living {{in close proximity}} to treated fields may be exposed to these pesticides. There is some indication that children living near agricultural fields have an increased risk of developing asthma and decreased lung function. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the proximity of participants' homes to fields likely treated with pesticides as proxy for environmental exposure to agricultural pesticides among participants of a Dutch birth cohort study, and to combine acreage of fields with farmer-reported pesticide use. METHODS: Potential pesticide exposure at the home address at the time of the 14 -year follow-up was estimated for 2291 participants of the Dutch PIAMA birth cohort study. We used spatial data on the presence of crops during the year 2012 to calculate the surface area of specific crops relevant for pesticide use in The Netherlands cultivated within 50, 100, 500 and 1000 m of the study homes. Farmer-reported pesticides use on specific crops from a national survey performed in 2012 was used to estimate the amount of all pesticides and pesticides with known <b>irritant</b> <b>properties</b> for the respiratory system applied within the aforementioned distances of the study homes. RESULTS: For 3 %, 7 %, 40 %, and 65 % of the homes, any relevant crops were present within 50, 100, 500 and 1000 m, respectively. Among these, the most frequent crops were corn, cereals, and potatoes. For almost the same percentages of homes, it was estimated that pesticides with known <b>irritant</b> <b>properties</b> for the respiratory system were potentially applied within these distances. CONCLUSIONS: We observed that a small proportion of the study participants lived in close proximity (< 50 or < 100 m) to agricultural fields with crops relevant for pesticide use in The Netherlands.

40|$|A {{series of}} seven oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids and naphthoquinones were tested {{regarding}} {{their ability to}} activate transient receptor potential ankyrin subtype 1 channel (TRPA 1). Three of the assayed compounds, namely, boropinal (3), juglone (5), and plumbagin (7), acted as strong modulators of TRPA 1 channels with EC 50 values of 9. 8, 1. 7, and 0. 5 mu M, respectively, as assessed by Ca 2 + assays. Moreover, the compounds elicited TRPA 1 currents in electrophysio-logical whole cell recordings. We additionally provide evidence that plumbagin activated TRPA 1 -positive neurons isolated from mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons but did not affect sensory neurons from TRPAl-deficient mice.

40|$|Capsaicin, {{a topical}} {{analgesic}} {{used in the}} treatment of chronic pain, has <b>irritant</b> <b>properties</b> that frequently interrupt its use. In this work, the effect of nanoencapsulation of the main capsaicinoids (capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin) on skin irritation was tested in humans. Skin tolerance of a novel vehicle composed of chitosan hydrogel containing nonloaded nanocapsules (CH-NC) was also evaluated. The chitosan hydrogel containing nanoencapsulated capsaicinoids (CH-NC-CP) did not cause skin irritation, as measured by an erythema probe and on a visual scale, while a formulation containing free capsaicinoids (chitosan gel with hydroalcoholic solution [CH-ET-CP]) and a commercially available capsaicinoids formulation caused skin irritation. Thirty-one percent of volunteers reported slight irritation one hour after application of CH-NC-CP, while moderate (46 % [CH-ET-CP] and 23 % [commercial product]) and severe (8 % [CH-ET-CP] and 69 % [commercial product]) irritation were described for the formulations containing free capsaicinoids. When CH-NC was applied to the skin, erythema was not observed and only 8 % of volunteers felt slight irritation, which demonstrates the utility of the novel vehicle.

In addition using a respiratory questionnaire, data on demographic information and respiratory symptoms were collected. The results showed that exposed medical staff had high prevalence rates of regular cough, wheezing and itching and burning sensations of the nose on acute exposure to formaldehyde. These effects were higher on chronic exposure. On the other hand, although the respiratory function parameters such as FVC (Forced Vital Capacity), FEV 1 (Volume that has been exhaled {{at the end of}} the first second of forced expiration) and PEF (The highest forced expiratory flow measured with a peak flow meter) diminished in some exposed subjects, the respiratory function in two groups of subjects did not indicate any significant differences (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the <b>irritant</b> <b>properties</b> of a new polyvinyl siloxane impression material (Ghenesile, Lascod-Italy) after single application to intact skin of the rabbit. Methods. The material was evaluated for primary skin irritation according to the UNI EN ISO 10993 - 10 : 1996 using three healthy male New Zealand White rabbits. The back of the animals was clipped free of fur and divided into four sites with the same area 24 h before application of the sample. The material was applied to only two sites; the other two were used as controls. All the sites were covered by gauze and the back of the rabbit was wrapped with a non-occlusive bandage. After 4 h, the bandage and the test material were removed; 1 h later the sites were examined for skin irritation and the observation was repeated after 24, 48 and 72 h.

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} new surfactants with low skin <b>irritant</b> <b>properties</b> for use in pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations, employing cell culture as an alternative method to in vivo testing. In addition, we sought to establish whether potential cytotoxic properties were related to the size of the counterions bound to the surfactants. Methods. Cytotoxicity was assessed in the mouse fibroblast cell line 3 T 6, and the human keratinocyte cell line NCTC 2544, using the MTT assay and uptake of the vital dye neutral red 24 h after dosing (NRU). Results. Lysine-derivative surfactants showed higher IC 50 s than did commercial anionic irritant compounds such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, proving to be no more harmful than amphoteric betaines. The aggressiveness of the surfactants depended upon the size of their constituent counterions: surfactants associated with lighter counterions showed a proportionally higher aggressivity than those with heavier ones. Conclusions. Synthetic lysine-derivative anionic surfactants are less irritant than commercial surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulphate and Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and are similar to Betaines. These surfactants may offer promising applications in pharmaceutical and cosmetic preparations, representing a potential alternative to commercial anionic surfactants as a result of their low irritancy potential...|$|R
40|$|Capsaicin, {{the primary}} pungent {{principle}} in hot peppers, is finding increasing {{use as a}} topical therapy {{for a variety of}} cutaneous disorders that involve pain and inflammation. Although topical capsaicin has shown therapeutic potential, the utility of capsaicin appears to be limited at present primarily by its <b>irritant</b> <b>properties</b> and secondarily by less than optimal therapeutic response, perhaps resulting from insufficient drug delivery. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), due to the safety of the component materials and the controlled release abilities, possess a great potential for topical administration of drugs and active substances.

Workers commonly affected include operating room nurses, radiographers, x-ray technicians and cleaners. Widespread hospital usage combined with its well-known <b>irritant</b> <b>properties,</b> has ensured an increase in occupationally-related illnesses during recent years. Operating room nurses, laboratory workers and x-ray technicians frequently contact GA in both the liquid and vapor form.

GA is a relatively potent irritant and sensitizer, with a well-documented history of symptoms following occupational exposure. Although mechanisms for GA toxicity have been postulated, research on the toxicological, teratogenic, and carcinogenic potential of this chemical has shown inconsistent results. Reducing workplace exposure to its lowest possible level represents the most important hazard reduction strategy. This may be achieved by keeping GA containers tightly sealed when not in use, maintaining adequate ventilation levels and the rigid adherence to appropriate personal protective equipment. Substitution with automated cold sterilization machines may be another appropriate measure, while banning unnecessary practices such as GA fogging and its use as a surface disinfectant may also be helpful in reducing occupational exposure in the health care environment...|$|R
