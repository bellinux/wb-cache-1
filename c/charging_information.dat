40|$|Abstract: With today's {{electric}} charging technology, {{charging time}} {{of an electric}} vehicle (EV) is much longer than that for a gasoline vehicle, and therefore the queueing effect at an EV charging station (CS) may be serious. That is, when an EV arrives at an overloaded CS, {{it is likely that}} the EV will wait for a long time before it is charged. This paper investigates the waiting problem for EV charging. We propose a Mobile CS (MCS) management system to dynamically distribute charging pole support that reduces the waiting times of EVs incurred in a fixed CS. A Mobile <b>Charging</b> <b>Information</b> Management System (MC-IMS) is presented to describe the execution flow of the MCS service. Simulation experiments are conducted to investigate the waiting time performance for the proposed mechanism. Our study indicates that the MCS-based MC-IMS provides effective EV charging with short waiting times.

The charges can be easily calculated according to the feedback information in the returned CM packets. In addition to the above we propose two signalling mechanisms for our charging schemes.

40|$|Abstract is a {{satellite}} borne experiment designed {{to study with}} great accuracy cosmic rays of galactic, solar, and trapped nature, with particular focus on the antimatter component.

40|$|Multicast {{transport}} of {{audio and video}} is becoming an important application for IP-based networks. Application-level QoS requirements can be met by network-layer QoS provision, by transport-layer error control, or {{by a combination of}} both. Which approach is most suitable depends on the tariffs set by the provider for network services with different QoS, the overhead introduced by error control, and the user requirements. In this paper we introduce an architecture that provides QoS support for audio and video in heterogeneous multicast scenarios by combining network layer QoS with transport layer QoS enhancement by Forward Error Correction (FEC). We present the <b>Charging</b> <b>Information</b> Protocol (CIP) for the distribution of tariff information. For the representation of tariff information the Tariff Formula Language (TFL) is defined.

40|$|Network {{delivery}} services providing "better-than-best-e#ort" service over the Internet are being studied, and are particularly necessary for multimedia applications. The selection {{and use of}} a specific delivery service involves negotiation between the user and the network; they agree upon specifications such as the type of service user packets will receive, the constraints the user tra#c must adhere to, and the price to be charged for the service. In this paper, we describe a protocol through which the user and the network (or two network domains) can negotiate network services. We refer to the protocol as a Resource Negotiation and Pricing protocol (RNAP). Through RNAP, the network service provider communicates availability of services and delivers price quotations and <b>charging</b> <b>information</b> to the user, and the user requests or re-negotiates services with desired specifications for one or more flows. RNAP protocol mechanisms are flexible enough to support multiple delivery service mode [...] ...|$|E
