5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. <b>Children</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} suggests {{a relationship between}} technology use and self-esteem. Such research has failed to consider young school-aged children and {{their use of the}} internet, particularly across contexts. Thirty-eight children aged 6 to 8 years rated the level and nature of their internet use (email, instant message, play games, visit websites) at home, school and in the community (i. e., at someone else’s house). They also rated items that measured home, school and peer self-esteem. Instant messaging at school explained 21 % of the differences in school self-esteem. As <b>children</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> report instant messaging at school, they also <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> report the highest school-based self-esteem. Instant messaging at someone else’s house explained 11 % of the differences in home self-esteem. As <b>children</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> report instant messaging at someone else’s house, they also <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> report the lowest home self-esteem. Visiting websites at someone else’s house explained 10 % of the differences in peer self-esteem. As <b>children</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> report visiting websites at someone else’s house, they also <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> report the highest peer self-esteem.

25|$|According to the World Health Organization, {{malnutrition}} is {{the biggest}} contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases. Six million children die of hunger every year. Underweight births and intrauterine growth restrictions cause 2.2 million child deaths a year. Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of vitamin A or zinc, for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition {{in the first two}} years is irreversible. Malnourished children grow up with worse health and lower education achievement. Their own <b>children</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be smaller. Malnutrition was previously seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, but malnutrition actually causes diseases, and can be fatal in its own right.|$|E
25|$|The {{understanding}} of friendship in children {{tends to be}} more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations. These friendships provide opportunity for playing and practicing self-regulation. Most <b>children</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> describe friendship in terms of things like sharing, and children are more likely to share with someone they consider to be a friend. As children mature, they become less individualized and are more aware of others. They gain the ability to empathize with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. They also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. Establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life.|$|E

25|$|Single mother {{households}} are critical in addressing feminization {{of poverty and}} can be broadly defined as households {{in which there are}} female headships and no male headships. Single mother {{households are}} at the highest risk of poverty for women due to lack of Income and resources. There is a continuing increase of single mother households in the world, which results in higher percentages of women in poverty. Single mothers are the poorest women in society, and their <b>children</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be disadvantaged in comparison to their peers. Different factors can be taken into account for the {{rise in the number of}} female headship in households. When men become migrant workers, women are left to be the main caretaker of their homes. Other factors such as illnesses and deaths of husbands lead to an increase in single mother households in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Nantes is {{younger than the}} national average, with 44.7 percent under age 29 (France 36.5 percent). People over age 60 account for 18.7 percent of the city's population (France 24 percent). Single-person households are 51.9 percent of the total, and 16.8 percent of households are families with children. Young couples with <b>children</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> move outside the city because of high property prices, and most newcomers are students (37 percent) and adults moving for professional reasons (49 percent). Students generally come from within the region, and working people are often from Paris. In 2013, the unemployment rate was 11.4 percent of the active population (France 10 percent, Loire-Atlantique 8.5 percent). The poorest council estates had unemployment rates of 22 to 47 percent. Of those employed, 57.8 percent are in intermediate or management positions, 24.2 percent are technicians and 13.1 percent are plant workers or similar.

25|$|Adolescence marks a {{rapid change}} in one's role within a family. Young <b>children</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> assert {{themselves}} forcefully, but {{are unable to}} demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship {{with his or her}} parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites {{in the first place and}} this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent–adolescent relationship is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks. Although conflicts between children and parents increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues. Regarding their important life issues, most adolescents still share the same attitudes and values as their parents.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{children}} having particular rights {{is a relatively}} new one.

500|$|Although a {{majority}} of the modern day slavery cases in Haiti are due to the practice of the restavek system, trafficking for Sexual exploitation in Haiti [...] is a widespread and pressing issue. [...] In recent years, Haiti has become a magnet for sex tourists. [...] Sex slavery includes the practices of coercion, forced prostitution, and trafficking for any sexual purposes. Sheldon Zhang defines sex trafficking as “migrants [...] are transported with the intent to perform sexual services...and in which the smuggling process is enabled through the use of force, fraud, or coercion.” Most victims are trafficked for prostitution, but others are used for pornography and stripping. <b>Children</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be trafficked within their own countries, while young women may be trafficked internally or internationally, sometimes with the consent of their husbands or other family members.|$|E
500|$|Divorce is {{difficult}} on all parties {{involved in the}} process, including the children. Due to the stressful nature of divorce, along with inherent issues {{on the amount of}} time the children can spend with each parent, the process can have a long and lasting impact on the children. Unless the children's parents are often involved in intense conflict, or one of the parents is abusive and/or mentally ill, the <b>children</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> fare better if the custody arrangement is a joint custody arrangement. Numerous studies have found that in joint custody arrangements, the <b>children</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> exhibit better relationships with their families, better performance in their schools, higher levels of self-esteem, and fewer conduct and emotional issues. Further, it has been found that children that have a sole custody arrangement tend to have poorer outcomes when compared to average children (or rather children who do not have divorced parents), where children that have a joint custody arrangement tend to fare as well as average children. However, joint physical custody with an even division of time is not always necessary. These effects are generally seen simply when the children spend a substantial amount of time with both parents. According to Robert Emery, a divorce mediation expert, [...] "In many ways, joint physical custody is the ideal arrangement for children because they still have two parents very much involved in their lives." [...] This statement has been supported by psychological data. [...] Speculation that parental conflict erases the benefits of joint physical custody have not been supported by empirical research. A 2017 paper appearing in a journal published by the American Psychological Association analyzed every study that included measures and controls for conflict when comparing joint and sole physical custody families. Conflict was neither more nor less damaging for children in joint physical custody than those in sole custody. Of 16 studies that controlled for conflict when measuring children’s adjustment, only one reported worse adjustment in joint physical custody. One study found that boys did better and girls worse. Fourteen studies reported either better outcomes in joint physical custody or no differences, even after taking conflict into account.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} few years of life, {{children}} are mastering concrete words such as [...] "car", [...] "bottle", [...] "dog", [...] "cat". By age 3, children are likely able to learn these concrete words without the need for a visual reference, so word learning tends to accelerate around this age. Once children reach school-age, they learn abstract words (e.g. [...] "love", [...] "freedom", [...] "success"). This broadens the vocabulary available for children to learn, which helps to account for the increase in word learning evident at school age. By age 5, <b>children</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have an expressive vocabulary of 2,100–2,200 words. By age 6, they have approximately 2,600 words of expressive vocabulary and 20,000–24,000 words of receptive vocabulary. Some claim that children experience a sudden acceleration in word learning, upwards of 20 words per day, but it tends to be much more gradual than this. From age 6 to 8, the average child in school is learning 6–7 words per day, and from age 8 to 12, approximately 12 words per day.|$|E

The five fathers are Zhiying Lin, Liang Zhang, Liang Tian, Yuelun Wang, and Tao Guo, Their parenting styles were examined using Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) by Robinson, Mandleco, Olsen, and Hart (1995). Every case was observed for 12 times and altogether sixty evaluation forms were collected and analyzed. The results indicated that: (1) five of them were authoritative, (2) The fathers with older <b>children</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> use authoritarian parenting style, whereas the fathers of younger <b>children</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be authoritative; (3) The fathers with girls <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> have less parental control, whereas the fathers with boys <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> have more parental control; and (4) the Taiwanese father, Lin, <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be more liberal and authoritative, whereas the Mainland China father, Guo showed more authoritarian sides in parenting. published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|R
500|$|In William Blake's poem in the Songs of Experience, titled [...] "The Tyger," [...] {{the tiger}} is a menacing and fearful animal. In Yann Martel's 2001 Man Booker Prize winning novel Life of Pi, the protagonist, {{surviving}} shipwreck for {{months in a}} small boat, somehow avoids being eaten by the other survivor, a large Bengal tiger. The story was adapted in Ang Lee's 2012 feature film of the same name. Jim Corbett's 1944 Man-Eaters of Kumaon tells ten true stories of his tiger-hunting exploits {{in what is now}} the northern Uttarakhand region of India. The book has sold over four million copies, and has been the basis of both fictional and documentary films. In Rudyard Kipling's 1894 The Jungle Book, the tiger, Shere Khan, is the mortal enemy of the human protagonist, Mowgli; the book has formed the basis of both live-action and animated films.

500|$|In {{addition}} to the numerous [...] "specific" [...] count-classifiers described above, Chinese has a [...] "general" [...] classifier [...] (...) , pronounced gè in Mandarin. This classifier is used for people, some abstract concepts, and other words {{that do not have}} special classifiers (such as 汉堡包 hànbǎobāo [...] "hamburger"), and may also be used as a replacement for a specific classifier such as (...) zhāng or (...) tiáo, especially in informal speech. In Mandarin Chinese, it has been noted as early as the 1940s that the use of [...] is increasing {{and that there is a}} general tendency towards replacing specific classifiers with it. Numerous studies have reported that both adults and <b>children</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> use [...] when they do not know the appropriate count-classifier, and even when they do but are speaking quickly or informally. The replacement of a specific classifier with the general [...] is known as classifier neutralization ("" [...] in Chinese, literally [...] "classifier 个-ization"). This occurs especially often among children and aphasics (individuals with damage to language-relevant areas of the brain), although normal speakers also neutralize frequently. It has been reported that most speakers know the appropriate classifiers for the words they are using and believe, when asked, that those classifiers are obligatory, but nevertheless use [...] without even realizing it in actual speech. As a result, in everyday spoken Mandarin the general classifier is [...] "hundreds of times more frequent" [...] than the specialized ones.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Crawley, Anderson, Kiersten Clark, {{and their}} colleagues {{conducted}} another study {{on the effects of}} Blue's Clues, this time researching whether more experienced viewers mastered the content and cognitive challenges faster and easier than first-time viewers. They surmised that experienced viewers would comprehend and interact more with the recurring and familiar segments of the show designed to aid comprehension, but they found that familiarity with the structure of an individual episode did not provide experienced viewers with an advantage over the inexperienced viewers. Crawley and Anderson also studied whether experienced viewers of Blue's Clues interacted more with other children's TV shows and whether the viewing behaviors they learned from Blue's Clues could be transferred to other shows. They found that although experienced viewers of Blue's Clues interacted with an episode of another series, they did not spend more time watching it than viewers unfamiliar with the show. The researchers stated, [...] "It is apparent that, although preschoolers learn to enthusiastically engage in overt audience participation, they do not, by and large, have a metacognitive understanding of why they do so." [...] The 2002 studies demonstrated that experience with watching one TV series affects how children watch other programs, especially in the way they interact with them. They also showed that since children are selective in the material they attend to and that their interaction increases with comprehension and mastery, <b>children</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> pay more attention to novel information and interact more with material they have seen before and mastered. The researchers predicted that since shows like Blue's Clues help children feel empowered to learn, it could have long-term effects in motivating children to learn and provide them with a lifelong love of learning.|$|E
