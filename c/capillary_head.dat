This paper proposes an integrated rainfall infiltration model based on the Green-Ampt model and the SCS-CN model. It achieves a complete governing equation for rainfall infiltration by momentum balance and the water budget based on the Green-Ampt assumption, and uses the curve number from the SCS-CN method to calculate the initial abstraction, which is used as a basic parameter for the governing equation of the intensity of rainfall loss during the runoff period.

The liquid hydrocarbon was Soltrol 170, a low-density branched alkane mixture. Liquid saturations were measured using a collinear dual-energy gamma radiation apparatus and liquid pressures were measured using hydrophilic (untreated) and hydrophobic (treated) ceramic tensiometers connected to pressure transducers. The experimental regime was selected to impose monotonically draining water and total liquid saturation paths to avoid hysteretic effects. Measured saturations and pressures are compared to values obtained from numerical simulations of the experiment using a finite element solution of the governing multiphase flow equations assuming negligible gas pressure gradients. Functional relationships between permeabilitiesk, saturations S, and capillary pressures P employed in the numerical model were estimated by two calibration methods which require different degrees of experimental effort.

40|$|Preferential {{infiltration}} {{is proposed}} to occur under atmospheric pressure but in unsaturated soil. Its domain is positioned between {{the domains of}} Richards’ equation and Darcy’s law. Rivulets {{in the form of}} tiny water streaks are considered to be the basic units of preferential infiltration. They move under atmospheric pressure and in pores that are filled with air before infiltration. Stokes flow relates variations in soil moisture with velocities of wetting and draining fronts, and with volume flux densities. We show that superposition of rivulets to rivulet ensembles leads to measurable soil moisture variations. The approach was applied to time series of soil moisture that result from sprinkler irrigation experiments and that were recorded with time domain reflectometry (TDR) equipment at depths of 0. 1 and 0. 2 m. A minimum water content, θ*, was identified that has to be exceeded at a particular depth before Stokes flow continues.

40|$|Methodologies for {{estimating}} hydraulic and {{solute transport}} properties of unsaturated, fractured rock are developed. The methodologies {{are applied to}} networks of discrete fractures {{for the purpose of}} estimating steady fluid flow rates and breakthrough curves of entrained solutes. The formulations employ the boundary integral method to discretize the outer rim of each fracture and to solve a two dimensional flow equation within fracture planes. A three dimensional variant of the two dimensional boundary integral method is used to calculate flow through a permeable matrix with embedded permeable fractures. Exterior and interior surfaces are discretized using boundary elements to account for flow between fractures and the matrix, and between the matrix and fractures and the exterior boundaries. Synthetic fracture networks are created using planar fractures of finite areal extent embedded within a three dimensional rock matrix for the purpose of performing sensitivity studies of network hydraulic conductivity with respect to geometric parameters, such as fracture orientation and density. Results of the sensitivity studies show that: (1) The global hydraulic conductivity is linearly dependent on the product of fracture transmissivity and density for fractures of which fully penetrate the rock volume; (2) The effect of correlation between fracture length and transmissivity is to increase the global hydraulic conductivity; and (3) Results using a three dimensional coupled fracture— matrix flow regime compare favorably with analytic results. Flow through variably saturated fracture networks is modeled by assuming a constant <b>capillary</b> <b>head</b> within individual fractures. A free surface is found using an iterative procedure which locates nodal points at the intersection of constant total head and pressure head contours.

In the wick region, the analysis uses an equilibrium model for heat transfer and a Brinkman-Forchheimer extended Darcy model for fluid flow. Averaged properties weighted with the porosity are used for the wick analysis. The state equation {{is used in the}} vapor core to relate density change to the operating pressure.

The Leverett J scaling function is modified by including the ratio of the apparent contact angles as a new scaling term.

Ocular microvascular castings from 6 Wistar rats were prepared by injection of epoxy resin through the common carotid arteries.

Immediately posterior to the globe, the ophthalmic artery trifurcates into the central retinal artery and two posterior ciliary arteries. The central retinal artery directly provides capillaries to the nerve fiber layer and only contributes to capillary beds in {{the neck of the}} nerve head.

The permeability function is expressed in terms of the incomplete Beta function ratio whose value may be conveniently found in some mathematical tables. Further, a general pore-size distribution function of soils has been obtained from the retention function. The derivation of the pore-size distribution function enables more rigorous examination and further exploration of the theories concerning water movement in partially saturated soils. In this respect, an explanation of the phenomenon of air entrapment during imbibition has been offered through an energy concept based upon the pore-size distribution function along with the retention function. Two criteria of affinity have been established for porous media. Media are said to be affine if their corresponding pore-size distribution parameters are identical. The scaling factor for the external dimension of the model has been chosen to be the <b>capillary</b> pressure <b>head</b> at the inflection. point of the retnetion curve, whose value is always finite. The effect of the pore-size distribution parameters upon the retention, permeability and diffusivity curves has been analyzed. The analysis shows the parameter governing the downward concavity of the retention curve is as important as that governing the upward concavity when it comes to computing the permeability values from the retention data. A new and simple apparatus and procedure for obtaining the retention data of soil water in the laboratory have been developed. The technique can expedite the acquisition of the data for either the drainage or the imbibition branch of the retention curve...|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{flow and}} mass {{transport}} in the vadose zone are {{strongly influenced by}} spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties. It has become common to characterize spatial variability geostatistically and to solve corresponding flow and/or transport problems stochastically. The typical (though not only) approach is to treat log saturated hydraulic conductivity, Y=log(10) K(s), and perhaps other medium properties as statistically homogeneous, isotropic, or anisotropic multivariate-Gaussian random fields with unique variance and autocorrelation scale. A growing body of literature suggests that Y {{as well as many}} other variables may possess heavy-tailed, non-Gaussian distributions, and/or scale-dependent statistical parameters representing a multiscale, hierarchical structure. Elsewhere, we have demonstrated that these important phenomena are difficult to detect, and are not fully tractable, with standard geostatistical methods. They are however detectable and tractable with a novel geostatistical method of analysis which treats such variables as samples from sub-Gaussian random fields subordinated to truncated fractional Brownian motion (tfBm) or truncated fractional Gaussian noise (tfGn). Each such field is a mixture of Gaussian components having random variances. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the extent to which hydraulic parameters of unsaturated soils exhibit heavy-tailed distributions and statistical scaling of the above type. As a test bed we have selected an experimental site near Maricopa, Arizona, at which soil texture data have been collected in boreholes and trenches to a depth of 15 m over an area of 3600 m(2). Since hydraulic parameters are difficult to measure to such depths we estimate them using a neural network pedotransfer model. Input data include percent sand, silt, and clay. Outputs include estimates of saturated and residual volumetric water content, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and (due to their wide applicability) parameters of the van Genuchten-Mualem constitutive model of unsaturated soil property variations with <b>capillary</b> pressure <b>head.</b> We find indeed that vertical and horizontal increments of our hydraulic parameter estimates exhibit heavy-tailed frequency distributions and statistical scaling which conform closely to our novel geostatistical framework. Its generality and applicability to the Maricopa site has far reaching implications vis-a-vis the geostatistical characterization of vadose zone properties and the stochastic modeling of flow and transport in unsaturated media at other sites...|$|R
40|$|AIM—The {{effect of}} {{breathing}} 100 % oxygen on retinal and optic nerve <b>head</b> <b>capillary</b> blood flow in smokers and non-smokers was investigated using scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (SLDF) {{as a new}} non-invasive method to visualise and quantify ocular blood flow.  METHOD— 10 eyes of 10  young healthy non-smoking volunteers (mean age 26  (SD 3) years) and nine eyes of nine young healthy smoking volunteers (mean age 26  (4) years) were investigated. All participants were asked not to smoke or consume caffeine containing drinks for at least 4  hours before the measurements. Blood flow measurements were performed before and after 100 % oxygen {{was applied to the}} subjects through a mask over a period of 5  minutes (6  litres per minute). Juxtapapillary retinal and optic nerve head blood flow were determined in arbitrary units using SLDF representing a combination of laser Doppler flowmetry and a scanning laser system allowing visualisation and quantification of the retinal and optic nerve head blood flow. Blood flow was determined in an area of 100  µm ×  100  µm. The level of carboxyhaemoglobin was determined in all subjects. A Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test (non-parametric) was used for statistical evaluation.  RESULTS—In the non-smoking group, retinal `flow' was reduced by 33 % (p =  0. 005), optic nerve head `flow' by 37 % (p =  0. 005). In the smoking group retinal flow was reduced by 10 % (p =  0. 01), optic nerve head flow by 13 % (p < 0. 008). The difference in reactivity to oxygen breathing between smokers and non-smokers was highly significant (p < 0. 00001). Increased carboxyhaemoglobin levels were not found in either of the groups. A significant reduction of the mean arterial blood pressure of 6 % (5 %) (p < 0. 02) was observed in the non-smoking group after administration of oxygen.  CONCLUSION—These results indicate that hyperoxia leads to a decrease in capillary blood flow of the retina and optic nerve head secondary to vasoconstriction, and that smokers do not respond to oxygen breathing as non-smokers do. The findings might be based on factors such as long term effects of nicotine on the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. ...|$|R
40|$|Climate change, {{which leads}} to more intense precipitation, {{combined}} with an increase of impervious surface, due to an increase of urbanization, has resulted in an increasing amount of stormwater entering the sewer system. This increase will lead to heavier loads on the existing sewer system, which in most cases already are overloaded, resulting in more frequent surface flooding causing damage to buildings and infrastructure. To improve this situation, there has lately {{been an increase in}} focusing on a sustainable stormwater management, which is based on Sustainable urban drainage systems, SUDS. One measure, which is considered used by multiple municipalities, is downspout disconnection. This measure is rarely used to day, and there is therefore little information about the effect of this measure. Usually the downspouts are connected to the sewer system and the surface water generated from the roof is therefore directly entering the sewer system. The runoff from the roof is usually generated very fast, and gives thus a great contribution to the amount of stormwater in the sewer system. This can easily be reduced by disconnecting the downspouts and lead the water to an appropriate infiltration surface. The effect of this measure is closely connected to the soils ability to infiltrate water, and it is therefore difficult to predict the reduction of stormwater without conducting field investigations. To be able to investigate the effect of downspout disconnection, and as a tool for making it easier to see if an area is suited for this measure or not, it has therefore ben established a MATLAB- model, in this thesis, which computes the amount of infiltrated water and the amount of generated runoff at each site. The MATLAB- model calculates with both using the Green-Ampt infiltration model and the Philip infiltration model, and was used to calculate the amount of infiltration and runoff at eleven sites in Oslo and four sites in Trondheim. In Oslo, the results showed a variation in the amount of infiltrated water. The best conditions for downspout disconnection was seen at site B 28, L 34, R 44, R 5 and S 75. At these sites it is suggested that the soil is capable to infiltrate the amount of generated stormwater without further measures. The sites in Trondheim showed all great conditions for infiltration, but because {{of the size of the}} infiltration area and the location, was site 3 and 4 preferred. To be able to see how different soil parameters affects the amount of infiltration, some simulations where done by changing some of the soil parameters. These simulations showed that the amount of infiltration is dependent on the soils saturated hydraulic conductivity, the initial soil moisture content and the wetting front <b>capillary</b> suction <b>head.</b> Because of this dependence, it is recommended that these parameters are measured at the site, and it is important that especially the Ksar- value is measured at multiple points at the site in order to obtain a representative value. By comparing the soil types at the sites and the ratio between the size of the roof area and the size of the infiltration area, the following is suggested. If the soil at the site is sandy and the infiltration area is one to twice as big as the roof area, it can be assumed that the infiltration capacity is good enough to infiltrate the amount of generated stormwater. Silty soil covers however a rather large range of Ksat- values depending on the percentage of silt in the soil, and the Ksat- value of the site should therefore be measured. Dependent on the soils ability to infiltrate water, it may be enough that the infiltration area is one to twice as big as the roof area, but this should be considered especially if the soils saturated hydraulic conductivity is of the lower value. The same yield also for a soil with a very high clay content. Whether this soil has a large enough infiltration capacity or not is dependent on the percentage of silt and sand fraction in the soil. The calculations done in this thesis shows also that for a site with a very high clay content, and thus a low Ksat- value, it is recommended to use an infiltration area three times or more, as big as the size of the roof area. The establishment of this model will help to develop downspout disconnection as a measure for stormwater managing, especially in residential areas. The results obtained in this thesis, shows that by disconnecting the downspouts from the sewer system, the reduction of amount of stormwater can be significant, where the soil properties are adequate. Downspout disconnection is therefore evaluated as a measure that should be considered in areas where stormwater management is a challenge...|$|R
