40|$|An {{atmosphere}} {{with reduced}} oxygen tension {{is required for}} the primary isolation of Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni. Therefore, we compared use of the conventional atmosphere of 5 % oxygen and 8 % carbon dioxide with use of a <b>candle</b> <b>jar</b> (17 % oxygen and 3 % carbon dioxide) for primary isolation of C. fetus subsp. jejuni from 263 positive canine, cattle, and turkey fecal or cecal specimens. At an incubation temperature of 42 degrees C, the atmosphere with 5 % oxygen resulted in more Campylobacter colonies per plate (P less than 0. 005) and consistently larger Campylobacter colonies (P less than 0. 005) than did the <b>candle</b> <b>jar,</b> whereas the growth of interfering flora was similar. Overall, 96 % of the 263 specimens were positive for C. fetus subsp. jejuni with 5 % oxygen, and 90 % were positive with the <b>candle</b> <b>jar</b> (P less than 0. 02). More striking differences in isolation rates were seen when both the temperature and the atmosphere were varied: 5 % oxygen at 42 degrees C enabled recovery of 93 % of the isolates from 70 positive specimens, versus 46 % recovery with the <b>candle</b> <b>jar</b> at 37 degrees C. Results with 5 % oxygen at 37 degrees C were intermediate. The addition of FBP supplement (0. 25 % each of ferrous sulfate, sodium metabisulfite, and sodium pyruvate) to Campy-BAP selective medium made no improvement over unsupplemented medium at 42 degrees C (whether in 5 % oxygen or in the <b>candle</b> <b>jar),</b> but there was significant improvement over unsupplemented medium when both media were incubated at 37 degrees in the <b>candle</b> <b>jar...</b>|$|E
40|$|Primary {{cultures}} of clinical material were screened {{for the presence}} of colonies suspected of being Streptococcus agalactiae (Lancefield group B). Sixty-three such cultures and 108 other isolates of beta-hemolytic streptococci (groups A, C, and G), encountered during the first 3 months of the investigation, were studied by Lancefield grouping, sodium hippurate hydrolysis, and a standardized CAMP test. All streptococci were inoculated perpendicularly to streaks of a beta-toxin-producing staphylococcus on sheep blood agar plates and incubated aerobically in a <b>candle</b> <b>jar</b> and anaerobically at 37 C. Plates were examined after 5 to 6 and 18 h of incubation. The production of a distinct "arrowhead" of hemolysis was indicative of a positive CAMP reaction. All group B streptococci produced a positive CAMP reaction in the <b>candle</b> <b>jar</b> or anaerobically, usually within 5 to 6 h, and aerobically after 18 h of incubation. All group A streptococci produced a positive reaction only under anaerobic conditions. Groups C and G streptococci were negative under all atmospheres.

40|$|Bio-Bag (Marion Laboratories, Kansas City, Mo.) type C {{is made up}} of a ziplock {{plastic bag}} which {{contains}} a Thayer-Martin plate and a crushable CO 2 -generating ampoule. This system was compared with the candle extinction jar, Gono-Pak (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, Wis.), and JEMBEC (GIBCO Diagnostics, Lawrence, Mass.) systems to determine their efficiency and reliability for the isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A total of 191 anal and 130 urethral specimens were tested. There were 104 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae (24 anal and 80 urethral). The <b>candle</b> <b>jar</b> and Bio-Bag systems each detected 98 (94 %) of the isolates. The Gono-Pak and JEMBEC systems detected 102 (98 %) and 100 (96 %) of the 104 isolates, respectively.

The Bio-Bag has the advantage of immediate CO 2 release as compared with the Gono-Pak and JEMBEC systems, where CO 2 production is dependent on the release of moisture from the medium.

40|$|The {{quantitative}} and qualitative growth response of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains was assessed under the following conditions: incubation in a <b>candle</b> <b>jar</b> (approximately 2. 5 % ambient CO 2) on medium without bicarbonate, incubation in air on medium without bicarbonate, incubation in air on medium with bicarbonate, and incubation in air in a sealed jar on medium with bicarbonate. Incubation {{in the presence of}} ambient CO 2 (<b>candle</b> <b>jar)</b> resulted in the highest plating efficiencies for the three laboratory strains 9, 62, and 2686. The addition of NaHCO 3 to the medium enhanced the growth response in air of all three strains, particularly if incubation was carried out in a closed environment (sealed jar). The qualitative growth response of 34 clinical isolates and laboratory strains was assessed under the same conditions of incubation after the plating of an inoculum containing approximately 2 X 10 (6) bacteria. The strains were divided into different classes based on their growth responses. About 40 % of the strains grew as well on bicarbonate-containing medium incubated in air in sealed jars as they did on medium without bicarbonate incubated in a <b>candle</b> <b>jar.</b> Ten percent of the strains showed only slight growth on bicarbonate containing medium incubated in sealed jars and appeared to have an almost obligate requirement for ambient CO 2. Twenty percent of the strains apparently had partially lost their requirement for gaseous C 02 and showed slight growth in air on medium without bicarbonate and slight to moderate growth in air on medium containing NaHCO 3. The remaining 30 % seemed to have completely lost their requirement for gaseous C 02 and/or the bicarbonate anion and grew almost as well in air on medium without bicarbonate as they did in either ambient C 02 (<b>candle</b> <b>jar)</b> or on medium containing bicarbonate incubated in a sealed jar. These results suggest that N. gonorrhoeae strains may vary widely in their requirements for CO 2 and/or the HCO 3 -anion. Incubation in the presence of ambient CO 2 tends to maximize the growth response on solid medium of those strains, which require it for growth. The presence of ambient CO 2 is particularly important if growth is to be obtained after the plating of small inocula. Medium conatining 0. 1 % NaHCO 3, if incubated in a closed environment (sealed jar), apperas to be equivalent to medium without bicarbonate incubated in ambient CO 2 in supporting the growth of some but not all strains of N. gonorrhoeae...|$|E

40|$|Isolation of Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli from stool {{specimens}} is done {{by growing}} campylobacter colonies on solid selective media with or without blood. However, recognition of these colonies can be difficult. Therefore, we decided to evaluate an isolation procedure based on the swarming of campylobacters through a semisolid medium. We developed a semisolid blood-free selective motility (SSM) medium which is composed of Mueller-Hinton broth with 0. 4 % agar and supplemented with cefoperazone (30 micrograms/ml) and trimethoprim (50 micrograms/ml). The SSM medium was compared with our previously described Butzler Medium Virion (Goossens et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 24 : 840 - 843, 1986) and blood-free medium (Bolton and Coates, J. Appl.

40|$|Background & objectives: Although polymicrobial infections {{involving}} both aerobic and anaerobic {{bacteria are}} {{very common in}} diabetic foot ulcers, in many centres of developing countries, anaerobes are rarely isolated due to technical difficulties. This can be overcome by using a new simple, innovative technique {{of a combination of}} candle combustion and use of acidified copper-coated steel wool, as reported here. Methods: In-house developed method was used in a prospective clinico-microbiological study for anaerobes from randomly selected 43 patients with diabetic foot ulcers along with conventional method of anaerobic culture in GasPak system and aerobic culture by standard laboratory procedures. For primary isolation of anaerobes, Brucella blood agar supplemented with hemin (5 μg/ml) and menadione (1 μg/ml) was used. Antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed by the standard disc diffusion method for aerobes and E-test method for anaerobes. Results: All the 43 samples were culture positive, of which aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) predominated, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus and diphtheroids. Anaerobes isolated from 21 samples were Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Veillonella spp. and Clostridium perfringens by both GasPak and in-house developed and modified <b>candle</b> <b>jar</b> techniques. Imipenem and metronidazole were most sensitive while clindamycin, penicillin and cefoxitin were least sensitive drugs for anaerobes.
