50|$|The 1929 Wall Street Crash {{ushered in}} {{more years of}} {{exacerbated}} financial hardship across Europe. Germany introduced foreign <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions</b> on its citizens, while both Germany and Great Britain abandoned the Gold Standard {{in the late summer}} of 1931. The Swiss franc soared in value against the currencies in which most of the Hotel Pontresina's guests received their incomes: visitor numbers collapsed correspondingly.|$|R
5000|$|The 1935 {{event was}} {{cancelled}} {{because of the}} rapidly deteriorating political situation, notably between France and Italy. Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia had led to League of Nations sanctions against Italy. On the northern side of the Alps, the German government had for its own reasons recently introduced transit and <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions</b> which made it impractical to include Germany in the route.|$|R
50|$|Ironically, {{during the}} 1980s gold reached its highest price {{as a result}} of {{international}} tensions reaping huge profits for the mining company conglomerates. However, because of <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions</b> and bans on the sales of Krugerrands in some countries, they were unable to invest abroad. The result was that they used their surplus funds to buy up businesses in virtually every activity in the economy.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} based on a West End play by Andrew Macrae about Englishmen {{travelling}} in Europe and the problems experienced by them due to post-war <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions.</b> It premiered at the Criterion on 2 June 1948 starring Yvonne Arnaud and produced by Hugh Beaumont; it was a smash hit, running for two years. Clement Attlee saw the play while he was Prime Minister.|$|R

50|$|The {{advent of}} the Internet has {{provided}} a forum for the commercialisation of trading on insider information. In 2016 a number of dark web sites were identified as marketplaces where such non-public information was bought and sold.

Such sites also provide a place for soliciting for corporate informants, where non-public information {{may be used for}} purposes other than stock trading.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is assumed}} that {{offshore}} outsourcing gave birth to [...] "borderless selling". The selling of services by offshore outsourcing service providers to foreign clients is free from actions specifically designed to hinder international trade, such as tariff barriers, <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and import quotas. This is largely {{because most of the}} services are sold or delivered electronically from the offshore service provider to the foreign client. This phenomenon gave birth to borderless selling.|$|R

50|$|There {{were three}} {{reasons why the}} Rombac {{initiative}} failed.

50|$|In the 1950s group {{cultural}} travel hardly existed, nor did overseas campuses for universities {{which would}} later proliferate.

50|$|In the North Africa, the {{situation}} was more complex. For example, in Morocco emigrants {{were not allowed to}} take more than $60 worth of Moroccan currency with them, although generally they were able to sell their property prior to leaving, and some were able to work around the <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions</b> by exchanging cash into jewelry or other portable valuables. This led some scholars to speculate the North African Jewish population, comprising two thirds of the exodus, on the whole did not suffer large property losses. However, opinions on this differ.|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to Mundell's inquiry on the optimality of currency areas, this article aims to understand {{under what circumstances}} a Pareto-dominant monetary union will be established. Using a multicountry overlapping generations model, we highlight gains from monetary union arising from reduced transactions costs and lower inflation. Despite these gains, countries acting independently will impose barriers to exchange through local <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions,</b> thereby creating transactions costs and providing an incentive for inflation. Therefore, the gains from monetary union {{are most likely to}} be lost without collective effort.

He planned the town as a resort from 1877 and it expanded rapidly, but along with many other UK resorts, especially those on the cold North Sea, it lost out to the cheap package holiday boom which opened up Spain (in particular) to the average holidaymaker, especially when <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions</b> were lifted in the 1970s and travellers could leave the UK with more than 65 pounds.|$|R

Measures taken at government level, as were <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions</b> and the quota imports were considered a necessity. They were previously taken by the countries with which Romania has trade relations. The crisis has {{had an impact on the}} business environment in Dej less than among larger firms and especially to the small traders and craftsmen. And in some cases even amongst the individual offices. Changes arising from the crisis required a greater presence of women in the social and economic life and especially their associations.

40|$|We {{study how}} <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions</b> and {{government}} transaction policies affect {{the values of}} fiat currencies in a two country, divisible good, search model. We show that these policies can generate equilibria where both currencies circulate as medium of exchange and where currency exchange occurs between citizens of different countries. Restrictions on the internal use of foreign currency can cause the domestic currency to be relatively more valuable to domestic agents while taxes on domestic currency create an incentive for home agents to hold foreign currency. We demonstrate that some policies increase prices and lower welfare while others do the reverse.

50|$|Keith's {{sister had}} married a wealthy naval officer, {{recently}} retired from service {{at the opening of}} the story. The couple plan a long pleasure cruise in their small yacht before settling in British Columbia, meanwhile leaving their 10-year-old daughter with Keith and his wife. Before leaving, they ask Keith for assistance in hiding a jewelry box in the yacht's concrete ballast. When the couple are killed in a shipwreck in French Polynesia, Keith becomes the permanent guardian and trustee of his niece (hence the title). But, the solicitor handling the estate finds that the money has disappeared; the evidence suggests that Keith's brother-in-law converted his wealth into diamonds to take with him abroad in order to evade export and <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions</b> intended to prevent capital leaving Britain.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a consumption-based asset pricing model {{in an open}} economy structure, in which the {{domestic}} consumers can buy goods both from domestic and foreign market, whereas they can only invest in domestic market. This is generally the condition faced by many emerging countries due to the foreign <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Our model shows that the exchange rate will influence asset prices through the marginal utility of consumption and increase the risks investors facing. The empirical examinations demonstrate that this model can successfully price the 25 Fama-French portfolios and industry portfolios in Chinese stock market. The exchange rate is an important pricing factor in the unconditional linear factor version of the model. We also find that the exchange risk is time-varying and countercyclical. This countercyclical property can help to explain the counter-cyclicality in equity premium...|$|R

50|$|Indian {{pharmaceutical}} {{firms have}} been {{able to take advantage of}} the severe shortage of basic medicines in Venezuela, which the Venezuelan Pharmaceutical Federation estimated to be around 70%. Indian firms exported $140 million worth of medicines to Venezuela in 2014-15. The Venezuelan market is so important to Indian firms that domestic politics can affect their share prices. For instance, shares of Glenmark and Dr. Reddy's fell by 5% and 2% respectively following the 2015 general elections and the expectation of currency devaluation in Venezuela. Due to currency controls placed on the economy by the Venezuelan government, Indian firms have been unable to repatriate revenue from their Venezuelan subsidiaries since 2013. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had to write-off $64.7 million in the fourth quarter of FY16 due to <b>currency</b> <b>restrictions</b> placed by the Venezuelan government, and the company was only permitted to repatriate $4 million in that quarter.|$|R
