50|$|The Zscaler service {{operates}} {{by having}} {{all of the}} Internet traffic from its clients sent through Zscaler's network of global data centers. In order to monitor or inspect secure HTTPS connections, Zscaler implements {{what is known as}} a man-in-the-middle attack to decrypt SSL traffic for users going through the Zscaler service. When a user attempts to open an HTTPS website, Zscaler mimics the website, as the user accesses the server. In response to a <b>CONNECT</b> <b>request</b> by the web browser, the server will send Zscaler a server certificate. Zscaler will then check the validity of the cert and then create a new cert signed by Zscaler. The new cert will be sent to the Web Browser, and assuming that the user has pre-installed a company root cert, the browser will check the validity of the cert and then accept and install the cert and then will continue to access the website. If a root cert has not been installed, then the user will receive an error stating {{that there is a problem}} with the website’s security certification and user will have the option to continue or not.|$|E

50|$|The second {{approach}} {{is to have a}} predefined backup path computed before the failure. This {{approach is}} said to be failure independent and it takes less processing time to recover as compared to the failure dependent approach. Here the backup path is calculated together with the primary at provisioning time. Even though the backup path is calculated, it is not assigned to a specific circuit before a failure occurs; cross <b>connect</b> <b>requests</b> are initiated after the fact on a first-come, first-served basis. Since this approach can only protect from a single failure at a time, if a second primary path fails and at least a portion of its backup path is already in used, this path won't be able to recover unless restoration technique is in place for such cases.|$|R

30|$|At {{the heart}} of our {{proposed}} approach is the user session, {{and one of the first}} tasks is to define a web session in order to track the user’s behavior. A session is most commonly defined as the set of click streams of contiguously visited webpages by a certain user aimed mostly at carrying out a single activity on the Web. It starts when the user opens a webpage residing on some server, and continues to define the stream of clicked links by the same user. Previous research in this area suggested a 5 -min inactivity as a mean to end a session [10]. Using this criterion, another work found that over a period of 2 months, a user’s click stream could be split into an average of 520 sessions, implying that a typical session would last for about 10 min, and includes about 60 requests to 12 different web servers. Due to the strong dependence on the particular timeout used, the work in [11] tried to find an alternative for defining a session. An algorithm was devised to segment the user’s click stream into many logical sessions, and assign Web requests to the session with the most recent use of the referring URL. In this respect, a logical session <b>connects</b> <b>requests</b> related to the same browsing behavior.|$|R

25|$|Around {{and above}} the map were more tellers who {{controlled}} the communications, connecting incoming reports to the plotter on the floor nearest that location on the map or <b>connecting</b> incoming <b>requests</b> for information to another teller who could read the map.

40|$|Multicast routing and {{admission}} control {{can be defined}} as follows. Various network users issue online requests for a connection to certain multicast sources. The network either <b>connects</b> this <b>request</b> or rejects it ({{admission control}} decision). If <b>request</b> is <b>connected,</b> a path with sufficient bandwidth is established starting at the requesting user and ending either at the source or at one of the users previously connected to the same source (route selection decision). The goal of these admission control and route selection decisions is to maximize total number of users connected (i. e. total thruput) subject to the network capacity constraints. This problem can be reduced to the online maximal dense tree problem: Upon a service request from a node in a weighted graph with a distinguished source, the node is either rejected or connected to the tree of previously connected nodes. The goal is to maximize the total number of requests while keeping the density (ratio of accepted re [...] ...|$|R
40|$|As Internet {{services}} {{become more}} popular and pervasive, a critical problem that arises is managing {{the performance of}} services under extreme overload. This paper presents a set of techniques for managing overload in complex, dynamic Internet services. These techniques are based on an adaptive admission control mechanism that attempts to bound the 90 th-percentile response time of requests flowing through the service. This is accomplished by internally monitoring {{the performance of the}} service, which is decomposed into a set of event-driven stages <b>connected</b> with <b>request</b> queues. By controlling the rate at which each stage admits requests, the service can perform focused overload management, for example, by filtering only those requests that lead to resource bottlenecks. We present two extensions of this basic controller that provide class-based service differentiation as well as application-specific service degradation. We evaluate these mechanisms using a complex Webbased e-mail service that is subjected to a realistic user load, as well as a simpler Web server benchmark...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the main problem of {{knowledge}} management: <b>connecting</b> of <b>requested</b> and available knowledge. We will neglect so called quasi-problems of knowledge management, such as: group knowledge, organizational memory or organizational learning. The thing {{that is not a}} quasi-problem, but is not considered at all is the question: How much influence does the group/organization have on expert/decision makers learning? This question could be also examined using knowledge-based system, similarly as Koning, Bredeweg, Breuker and Wielinga were modeling the learners behavior (Koning, Bredeweg, Breuker and Wielinga, 2000), but in their model this influence was not included. Solution of this problem does not influence the relation between KM and KBS. Actually, KBS builds up on the available knowledge, and does not have to engage in the acquisition of the knew or the development of the existing knowledge. The starting point for our hypothesis is the assertion that the available knowledge that exist within the experts/decision makers is bigger than the knowledge used by them, and that the required knowledge is specified by the processes which are happening within the organization.
