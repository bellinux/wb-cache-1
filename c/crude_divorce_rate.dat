50|$|Another {{measure of}} divorces is the divorce to {{marriage}} ratio, {{which is the}} number of divorces to the number of marriages in a given year (the ratio of the <b>crude</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> to the crude marriage rate). For example, if there are 550 divorces and 1,000 marriages in a given year in a given area, the ratio would be one divorce for every two marriages, e.g. a ratio of 0.55 (55%). However, this measurement compares two unlike populations, those who can marry and those who can divorce.|$|E
50|$|One {{measure of}} divorces is the <b>crude</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate,</b> {{which is the}} number of divorces per 1,000 population.

For example, it would include young children who are clearly not of marriageable age in its sample. A related measure is the refined divorce rate which measures the number of divorces per 1,000 women married to men, so that non-married persons, e.g. young children are left out of the rate.|$|E

In light of the changing demographics of divorce patterns, we investigate the relationship between economic variables and divorce, controlling for a set of social and life course variables. The analyses was conducted using an econometric simultaneous equation model (SEM) and 2 SLS method. The results indicated that there is simultaneous relationship between the mean age at first marriage for women, female labor force participation and the <b>crude</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate.</b> We find that factors that improve financial stability are positively associated with divorce trends. Understanding the effects of female labor force participation is therefore important to explain divorce trends. Our results suggest that the influence of the the unemployment elasticity and Consumer price index elasticity on divorce have declined and almost and disappeared. We also find that a range of other social and life course factors are also important to be considered relevant whether or not a person divorces...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{analyses}} {{the divorce}} rate in the Czech Republic after the year 1989. The first chapter {{is devoted to the}} definition of basic terms. Divorce is the legal dissolution of marriage during the life of spouses. Divorce is the dissolving of the bonds of matrimony between a married couple under the rule of law. Divorce is a social phenomenon reflecting the family stability, there is a transformation of traditional behavioural patterns, moral criteria and economic incentives. Since 1989 till present {{the divorce rate}} in the Czech Republic is at a high level. The second chapter of the theoretical part evaluates the development and current situation of divorce rate in our country. It is divided into three subsections: Influencing factors of divorce, causes of divorce and divorce rates in Europe. The aim of this diploma thesis is the evaluation of the development of causes of the divorce in the Czech population, capturing the specifics of the development of divorce in the new socio - economic conditions after 1989. With regard to the objective of the diploma thesis I set three hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : Compared with other EU countries in the Czech Republic the divorce rate persists at a high level after 1989. Hypothesis 2 : The divorce rate varies by region in the Czech Republic. It is the highest in regions undergoing restructuring of the economy, with high unemployment rate and social problems. Hypothesis 3 : The divorce rate is high in big cities and on the contrary low in traditional, predominantly, rural regions with a stable population. I conducted a quantitative research in the form of data analysis. The main source of the data was the Czech Statistical Office and Eurostat. I have analysed and compared the data which reveal the divorce rate in the Czech Republic and the EU in 2011 and the development of divorce from the year 1989. The data were analysed by correlation and spatial analysis and to compare the data I used the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results show that the divorce rate in the Czech Republic in comparison with other EU countries after 1989 remains at a high level. <b>Crude</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> since 1989 is around 3. 0 divorces per 1000 inhabitants, which represents one of the highest divorce rates among EU countries. The divorce rate in the Czech Republic {{was one of the few}} demographic processes that were the least affected by the economic and social transformations after 1989. According to the results of the data analysis for the year 2011 I have verified, that the divorce rate in the Czech Republic is territorially differentiated, varies in different regions, cities and rural areas. High <b>crude</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> is in districts undergoing restructuring of the economy and as a result there is a high rate of unemployment and social problems are emerging. The highest divorce rate in 2011 was in Česká Lípa. Conversely, the lowest <b>crude</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> is the less populated districts, with a stable population and a high proportion of religious people. In 2011, the lowest <b>crude</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> was in the district of Jihlava. Religion had the most statistically significant effect on the divorce rate. In districts with a higher proportion of religious people the <b>crude</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> is lower than in districts with a lower proportion of religious people...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We examine {{differences}} across Europe in attitudes towards divorce involving {{children under the}} age of 12. We hypothesize that these attitudes are less favourable in countries where poverty among single parent households is common than in countries where such poverty is rare. We also expect that divorce involving young children is more accepted in countries where enrolment in child care is high. METHODS: Our sample consists of 37, 975 individuals from 22 countries, obtained from the European Social Survey (2006). We conduct multilevel regression analyses including individual-level and country-level variables. RESULTS: Findings confirm our main hypotheses: the lower the poverty rate among single parents and the higher enrolment in childcare, the lower the disapproval of divorce when young children are involved. These findings remain when taking into account the <b>crude</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> and secularisation at the country level, and when controlling for differences in the composition of populations with regard to individual characteristics that are associated with divorce attitudes. Additionally, cross-level interactions indicate that poverty among single parents has the strongest impact on mothers' divorce attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Divorce attitudes appear to be related to people's assessment of the consequences of divorce for the children involved. Cross-European differences in attitudes towards divorce involving young children are associated with two aspects of welfare states that are indicative of the consequences of divorce for children and the parent that takes care of them: poverty among single parents and child care. © 2012 Arieke J.

40|$|This paper revisits the {{evidence}} {{on the impact of}} unilateral divorce laws on <b>divorce</b> <b>rates</b> in the United States. Most states switched from requiring mutual consent to allowing unilateral or no-fault divorce between 1970 and 1985, while the national <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> more than doubled after 1965. According to the Coase theorem, however, the legal shift should have had no effect on <b>divorce</b> <b>rates.</b> Recent papers using cross-sectional micro data have disputed the empirical importance of unilateral divorce, disagreeing in particular about controls for state-level heterogeneity in divorce propensities. This paper uses a panel of state-level <b>divorce</b> <b>rates</b> which includes virtually every divorce in the U. S. over the entire period of the law changes. Adding comprehensive controls - year and state fixed effects and state fixed trends - for changing unobservable divorce propensities reveals that the <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> would have been about 6 % lower if states had not switched to unilateral divorce, accounting for 17 % of the increase in the <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> between 1968 and 1988. Additional results in this paper demonstrate that the type of unilateral divorce law that states adopted matters. Weaker versions of unilateral divorce, which retain elements of mutual divorce, raised the <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> significantly, but by less than the strongest versions of unilateral divorce did. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES. Period {{effects of}} per capita {{consumption}} of alcohol and <b>divorce</b> <b>rates</b> are assessed for change in quantity and frequency among age/sex groups in multiple longitudinal studies. METHODS. Twenty-five studies of quantity and 29 studies of frequency are used. Studies are from 15 nations and cover periods of 1 to 21 years. Models predict the standardized mean difference for quantity and frequency based on period effects and group-level and methodological variables. RESULTS. When both the period effects of {{per capita consumption}} and the <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> are considered, the <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> significantly predicts change in quantity and frequency.

We use a quasi-experimental set-up and exploit the different timing of the reforms in divorce laws across countries. We account for unobserved country-specific factors by introducing country fixed effects, and we include country-specific trends to control for time-varying factors at the country level that may be correlated with <b>divorce</b> <b>rates</b> and <b>divorce</b> laws, such as changing social norms or slow moving demographic trends. We find that the different reforms that "made divorce easier" were followed by significant increases in <b>divorce</b> <b>rates.</b> The effect of no-fault legislation was strong and permanent, while unilateral reforms only had a temporary effect on <b>divorce</b> <b>rates.</b> Overall, we estimate that the legal reforms account for about 20 percent of the increase in <b>divorce</b> <b>rates</b> in Europe between 1960 and 2002. <b>divorce</b> <b>rates,</b> legislation. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{response}} of the <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> to law reform introducing unilateral divorce after controlling for law reforms concerning the aftermath of divorce, which are omitted from most previous works. We introduce two main policy changes that have swept the U. S. since the late 1970 s; the approval of the joint custody regime and the Child Support Enforcement program. Because those reforms affect divorce decisions by counteracting the reallocation of property rights generated by the unilateral divorce procedure and by increasing the expected financial costs of divorce, it is arguable that their omission might obscure the impact of unilateral divorce reforms on <b>divorce</b> <b>rates.</b> Our results suggest that what has driven the decline in the <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> since the 1980 s are law reforms concerning the aftermath of divorce rather than a reverse response of <b>divorce</b> <b>rates</b> to the adoption of unilateral divorce laws. Supplemental analysis, developed to examine the frequency of permanent shocks in U.
