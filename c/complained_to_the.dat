5|$|A papal bull of 11 July 1265 {{reveals that}} Paisley Abbey built {{only a small}} oratory served by Paisley monks. Twenty years after the bishop's ruling Paisley <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> papacy, which led Pope Clement IV to issue two bulls, dated 11 June 1265 and 6 February 1266, {{appointing}} mandatories to settle the dispute; {{the results of their}} deliberations are unknown. Crossraguel was not finally founded until about two decades after Donnchadh's death, probably by 1270; its first abbot, Abbot Patrick, is attested between 1274 and 1292.|$|E

5|$|Herchmer {{recruited}} and {{commanded a}} group of 144 mounted police volunteers, who made up {{almost half of the}} new 2nd Battalion of the Canadian Mounted Rifles; many of the other volunteers in the battalion were also ex-policemen. Soon after the battalion's arrival in South Africa, however, Herchmer's superior, Major General Edward Hutton, concluded that Herchmer was unsuited for military command and retired him from duty. Herchmer <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister, who then dismissed him from the police altogether, replacing him with Aylesworth Perry, a career policeman and a supporter of the Liberal government.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Wisconsin {{achieved}} statehood; Indian {{nations were}} under increased pressure for removal and marginalization. Corrupt US Indian agents controlled annuity payments, sometimes underpaying tribes, and took authority not granted {{them by the}} bands. They allowed white settlers to move onto Ojibwa lands and refused the Ojibwe the rights reserved by treaties. The Ojibwa <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> President about the mistreatment and broken promises, but politicians were more apt to listen to western land speculators, who saw possibilities for profit in removing the Ojibwa to Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|After socialist {{gains in}} the legislature, the Argentine {{government}} introduced several bills in May 1914 which would have put the battleships up for sale, {{but they were all}} defeated by late June. Following the commencement of the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US State Department; the former believed that the British were going to be given the ships as soon as the ships reached Argentina, and the latter considered it the responsibility of the United States to ensure that the ships never left Argentina's possession. International armament companies attempted to get Argentina to sell to one of the smaller Balkan countries and expected that the ships would then find their way into the war.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{licensed}} to practise {{medicine in the}} United States, he began testing the boxes on human beings diagnosed with cancer and schizophrenia. In one case the test had to be stopped prematurely because the subject heard a rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, {{that he had been}} hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American Medical Association that he was practising without a licence. He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.|$|E
5|$|In 1883 {{architectural}} historian Hayter Lewis <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British Archaeological Association {{that more}} {{needed to be}} done to protect the ruins, contrasting their poor treatment with that of the other castles along the coast. Despite this, concerns continued to be raised about the safety of the ruins facing along the sea, and in 1894 the Royal Engineers blew up the bastions and the keep on the seaward side using guncotton. The town of Deal then bought the remains from the government for £35 for use as part of their local sea defences. Coastal erosion continued and between 1988 and 1989 the remains were encased in concrete to form a sea wall, although they remain vulnerable to further coastal erosion. The remains of the castle are protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Stroud {{advertised in}} a {{publication}} {{that he had}} not received any royalties from the sales of Diseases of Canaries. In retaliation, the publisher <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> warden, and, as a result, proceedings were initiated to transfer Stroud to Alcatraz, where he would not be permitted to keep his birds. In the end, however, Stroud was able to keep both his birds and canary-selling business at Leavenworth. Stroud avoided trouble for several more years, until it came to light that some of the equipment Stroud had requested for his lab was in fact being used as a home-made still to distill alcohol. Officials finally had the wedge they needed to drive Stroud out.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{encourage}} a new stream of research into complaints and the role of the chief executive officer (CEO). The objectives of this paper were firstly <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> intensity of dissatisfaction driving customers <b>to</b> <b>complain</b> directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CEO and secondly <b>to</b> ascertain if <b>the</b> reasons for <b>complaining</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CEO were different to those of complainants using ‘normal’ channels. A leading financial services company in the UK provided access to its complaint letters and its CEO. Based on analysis of a sample of 100 letters sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CEO and 100 standard complaint letters, it was found that customers <b>complaining</b> directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CEO have a significantly greater intensity of dissatisfaction. However, unexpectedly, despite the greater positional power of the CEO, <b>the</b> reasons for <b>complaining</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CEO were little different <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reasons for using the ‘normal’ channels. Interestingly most of <b>the</b> complainants <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CEO had multiple reasons for complaint suggesting that complaints <b>to</b> <b>the</b> CEO are motivated by multiple underlying service failures...|$|R

5|$|In November 1944 Duff Cooper was {{appointed}} British ambassador to France and was provided accommodation at the Hôtel Le Bristol, where the Wodehouses were living. Cooper <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French authorities, {{and the couple}} were moved to a different hotel. They were subsequently arrested by French police and placed under preventive detention, despite no charges being presented. When Muggeridge tracked them down later, {{he managed to get}} Ethel released straight away and, four days later, ensured that the French authorities declared Wodehouse unwell and put him in a nearby hospital, which was more comfortable than where they had been detained. While in this hospital, Wodehouse worked on his novel Uncle Dynamite.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1897, Clark {{attempted}} to secure protection for his holdings from the British South Africa Company. The Company took little notice of him. A local chief, Chintanda, <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Company in 1899 that Clark had secured his concessions while passing himself {{off as a}} Company official and had been collecting hut tax {{for at least two}} years under this pretence. The Company resolved to remove him from power, and did so in 1902. Clark then farmed for about two decades, with some success, and moved in the late 1910s to Broken Hill. There he became a prominent local figure, and a partner in the first licensed brewery in Northern Rhodesia. Remaining in Broken Hill for the rest of his life, he died there in 1927.|$|E

5|$|The Australians had {{continued}} to operate independently within Phuoc Tuy province, and while the war had become a series of big unit search and destroy operations in a war of attrition for the Americans, they had pursued their own counter-insurgency campaign. Regardless, differences of opinion between Australian and American methods had produced friction, and increasingly impatient with the Australian approach, in early 1967 the Commander US MACV, General William Westmoreland, had <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, demanding a more aggressive approach. However, the Australians were convinced that deliberate patrolling techniques were more effective in separating communist forces from {{the population in the}} villages while working towards slowly extending government control, and such urgings went largely unheeded.|$|E
5|$|The Christians {{responded to}} these {{actions of the}} central {{government}} with a fresh wave of fury against the Jews so that in late May violence was in the air. The Jews described many cases in which they were assaulted or beaten by the Greeks, and the sons of the British and the Greek consuls were among those who beat up a number of Jews. When the Jews <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> governor, he ordered the complainants subjected to four to five hundred blows of the bastinado. The qadi disassociated himself from the actions of the governor, who declared that he had acted upon the demands of the consuls. On top of that, the governor ordered five other Jews arrested.|$|E
5|$|The {{blockade}} set by Grenville {{was initially}} {{some distance from}} the town, and did not prevent Blake from sending and receiving messages. The besieging army was reinforced soon after with Goring's infantry and artillery units, and so, with a large force, the attackers closed in on the town, establishing entrenchments within musket-shot of Taunton's defences. Command of the siege passed to Berkeley, though Grenville's troops often failed to follow the new commander's orders, and some of them deserted. Despite Grenville's retirement from the battle due to injury, he and Berkeley clashed; Grenville <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Prince of Wales that Berkeley was conducting the siege badly, while Berkeley claimed that Grenville had given his men orders to desert. These disagreements led Hopton, by now the commander of the Royalist forces in the West Country, to be given command of the siege.|$|E

5|$|The {{coalition}} {{was successful}} in taking control of both houses of the legislature; with the Senate election to be held just over a week later, intense politicking took place. Some lawmakers went into hiding for fear they would be pressured by the other side. The coalition decided on McKisson as their candidate {{the day before the}} balloting began. Three Republican state representatives who had voted with the Democrats to organize the legislature switched sides and voted for Hanna, who triumphed with a bare majority in both the short and long term elections. Bribery was alleged; legislative leaders <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States Senate, which took no action against Hanna. McKisson lost a re-election bid as mayor in 1899; Hanna remained a powerful figure in the Senate until his death in 1904.|$|E
5|$|When Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, Bennett was removed from his post as constable. He was initially replaced by Thomas Rosse and then, in 1661, by Philip Piper. A gaol {{was built in the}} centre of the bailey in the late-17th century; it was bought by the constable and was adopted as the county gaol. In 1690, the county <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King that the constable, Sir Hugh Pyper, had allowed it to fall into disrepair and that the male and female prisoners were sleeping together in the same quarters. Two years later, the Crown granted the post of constable in perpetuity to Hugh and for two generations after him; in exchange, Hugh agreed to invest £120 in repairing the facility. The bailey was also used for carrying out executions.|$|E
5|$|In an earlier, more celebrated case, Padfield v.

The farmers <b>complained</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under section 19(3) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958. Under the section, the Minister had power to direct that a complaint be considered by the Committee of Investigation {{but he refused to}} exercise the statutory power and provided no reasons for his refusal. The farmers alleged misconduct on Minister's part. The House of Lords held that a minister's power under an Act is not unfettered, and that the Minister in question had effectively frustrated the objects of the statute as his non-exercise of the power had been based on a misunderstanding of the purpose for which the power was given to him. Parliament must have conferred the discretion with the intention that it should be used to promote the policy and objects of the Act, and the Minister could not act so as to frustrate the policy and objects of the Act.|$|E
