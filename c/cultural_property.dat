2500|$|With the 1954 amendment, {{the three}} {{categories}} were reorganized into four: Tangible <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties,</b> Intangible <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties,</b> Folk Materials (split {{off from the}} former Tangible <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> category), and Monuments (new name for the former Historic Sites, Places of Scenic beauty, Natural Monuments" [...] category). Buried <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> were introduced as a new category, separate from Tangible <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties.</b> In addition, a designation system was established for Important Intangible <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> and Important Tangible Folk Properties.|$|R
50|$|Folk <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> can then, if they satisfy certain criteria, be {{designated}} Important Tangible Folk <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> (jūyō yūkei minzoku bunkazai) or Important Intangible Folk <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> (jūyō mukei minzoku bunkazai).|$|R

5|$|The act was {{originally}} intended to discourage the handling of stolen property but several courts have judged that the National Stolen Property Act is sufficiently broad in scope to apply to goods crossing into the United States from a foreign nation, and is therefore applicable {{in the case of}} stolen <b>cultural</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E

25|$|The new law {{combined}} {{the laws of}} 1919, 1929 and 1933, expanding their scope to cover also Intangible <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties,</b> such as performing and applied arts, Folk <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> and Buried <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties.</b> Before {{the enactment of the}} law, only Intangible <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> of especially high value at risk of extinction had been protected. Even by international standards, the 1950 law covered a broad spectrum of properties. The law was the basis for the establishment of the Committee for the Protection of <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties,</b> a precursor of today's Agency for Cultural Affairs. It allowed the selection of the most important <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties,</b> set restrictions on the alteration, repair and export of <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> and provided measures for the preservation and utilization of such properties.|$|R
2500|$|The Law for the Protection of <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> 1950 classifies items {{designated}} as <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> {{in the following}} categories: ...|$|R

On 19 March 2013, the National Museum declared as Important <b>Cultural</b> <b>Property</b> the island's Guyangan Cave System, where precolonial wooden coffins, remains, and the Banton Cloth were found.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{architectural}} and historical value of Malta's fortifications is widely acknowledged, and many {{also serve as}} tourist attractions. All fortifications were included on the Antiquities List of 1925, and virtually all surviving Hospitaller fortifications are now listed on the National Inventory of the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Property</b> of the Maltese Islands, Malta's national heritage register. The fortified city of Valletta has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO since 1980. The other fortifications around Malta's harbour area, the fortified cities of Mdina and the Cittadella, {{as well as the}} Victoria Lines have been on the tentative list of World Heritage Sites since 1998.|$|E

40|$|As {{a country}} with 11 {{properties}} included on the World Heritage List and approximately 12, 000 important <b>cultural</b> <b>properties,</b> Korea has been continuously carrying out the inventory and documentation of <b>cultural</b> <b>properties</b> to conserve and manage them since the 1960 s. The inventory of <b>cultural</b> <b>properties</b> had been carried out by making and managing a register which recorded basic information mainly on state-designated <b>cultural</b> <b>properties</b> such as their size, quantity, and location. The documentation of <b>cultural</b> <b>properties</b> was also carried out by making measured drawings. However, the inventory and documentation done under the previous analog method had a limit to the information it could provide for the effective conservation and management of <b>cultural</b> <b>properties.</b> Moreover, in recent times important <b>cultural</b> <b>properties</b> have frequently been damaged by man-made and natural disasters such as arson, forest fires, and floods, so an alternative was required. Accordingly, Korea actively introduced digital techniques led by {{the government for the}} inventory and documentation of important <b>cultural</b> <b>properties.</b> In this process, the government established the concept of a digital set, built a more efficie nt integrated data management system, and created standardized guidelines to maximize the effectiveness of data acquisition, management, and utilization that greatly increased the level of digital inventory, documentation, and archiving...|$|R
5|$|Doctor Francisco Layna Serrano {{of nearby}} Ruguilla {{had for years}} tried to save the monastery but had failed to {{interest}} {{the government in the}} expensive preservation proposal. Realizing that this was his last chance to document the place as its stones were being removed, he wrote a monograph of its history and included a site plan of the layout of buildings, written from memory. As a result of his efforts, on June 3, 1931, Santa María de Óvila was listed as a National Monument of Spain, or Bien de Interés Cultural (<b>Cultural</b> <b>Property).</b> Layna Serrano published his monograph in 1932. In 1933, the monastery's historic cartulary was brought to the University of Madrid and published; the original was archived at the University of Oviedo.|$|E
5|$|The Louvre is {{involved}} in controversies that surround <b>cultural</b> <b>property</b> seized under Napoleon I, as well as during World War II by the Nazis. During Nazi occupation, thousands of artworks were stolen. But after the war, 61,233 articles of more than 150,000 seized artworks returned to France and {{were assigned to the}} Louvre's Office des Biens Privés. In 1949, it entrusted 2,130 unclaimed pieces (including 1,001 paintings) to the Direction des Musées de France in order to keep them under appropriate conditions of conservation until their restitution and meanwhile classified them as MNRs (Musées Nationaux Recuperation or, in English, the National Museums of Recovered Artwork). Some 10% to 35% of the pieces are believed to come from Jewish spoliations and until the identification of their rightful owners, which declined {{at the end of the}} 1960s, they are registered indefinitely on separate inventories from the museum's collections.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was {{included on the}} Antiquities List of 1925, as La Castellania. It has been a Grade 1 scheduled property since 1992, and it is listed on the National Inventory of the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Property</b> of the Maltese Islands. The court documents, of the Magna Curia Castellania (MCC), are now stored and conserved at the Banca Giuratale in Mdina. The documents form part of the National Archives of Malta and are used by historians as primary sources to research about Malta during the knights of St. John. The archives of the Acta Originalia of the Magna Curia Castellania (AOM) include 1,411 volumes, dating from {{the early years of}} the rule of the knights.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "National Treasure" [...] in the museum's name {{refers to}} [...] "old" [...] National Treasures of Japan, term which denoted all the state-designated <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> of Japan before the Law for the Protection of <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> came into force on August 29, 1950. All {{of the old}} {{national}} treasures became Important <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> {{and some of them}} have been designated as (new) National Treasures since June 9, 1951. From a current perspective the name refers to a museum housing both Important <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> and National Treasures.|$|R
5|$|The museum lies in {{the center}} of Paris on the Right Bank. The neighborhood, known as the 1st arrondissement, was home to the former Tuileries Palace, which closed off the western end of the Louvre {{entrance}} courtyard, but was heavily damaged by fire during the Paris Commune of 1871 and later demolished. The adjacent Tuileries Gardens, created in 1564 by Catherine de' Medici, was designed in 1664 by André Le Nôtre. The gardens house the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, a contemporary art exhibition space which was used to store confiscated Jewish <b>cultural</b> <b>property</b> during the 1940 to 1944 German occupation of France. Parallel to the Jeu de Paume is the Orangerie, home to the famous Water Lilies paintings by Claude Monet.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's campaigns {{acquired}} Italian {{pieces by}} treaties, as war reparations, and Northern European pieces as spoils {{as well as}} some antiquities excavated in Egypt, though {{the vast majority of the}} latter were seized as war reparations by the British army and are now part of collections of the British Museum. On the other hand, the Dendera zodiac is, like the Rosetta stone, claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821, before the Egyptian Anti-export legislation of 1835. The Louvre administration has thus argued in favor of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return. The museum participates too in arbitration sessions held via UNESCO's Committee for Promoting the Return of <b>Cultural</b> <b>Property</b> to Its Countries of Origin. The museum consequently returned in 2009 five Egyptian fragments of frescoes (30cm x 15cm each) whose existence of the tomb of origin had only been brought to the authorities attention in 2008, eight to five years after their good-faith acquisition by the museum from two private collections and after the necessary respect of the procedure of déclassement from French public collections before the Commission scientifique nationale des collections des musées de France.|$|E
5|$|This item, {{consisting}} of one painting and associated caption/text, was originally the third {{scene of the}} Matsudaira clan scroll before being reshaped into a hanging scroll by Masuda Donō in 1933. At some point it was in possession of the Ōkura clan　(大倉家), but it is now owned by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and in custody of the Tokyo National Museum. It was designated an Important <b>Cultural</b> <b>Property</b> on March 31, 1953. Like its preceding and successive scenes (scenes 2 and 3 from the Gotoh edition), the painting depicts the celebration for the 50th day {{of the birth of}} the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō in the evening of Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008). The main characters are in full dress in a room decorated with kichō partitioners and the prince's grandfather, Fujiwara no Michinaga at the bottom is offering rice cake (mochi) to the prince in a form of ceremonial ritual. The female servant at the bottom right is presumably the author of the diary Murasaki Shikibu.|$|E
50|$|Items {{designated}} Tangible <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> can then, if they satisfy certain criteria, {{be designated}} Important <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> of Japan (jūyō bunkazai) or National Treasures (kokuhō) for especially valuable items.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2008, some 8,232 {{immovable}} <b>cultural</b> <b>properties</b> {{and heritage}} sites have been identified, the last being those places in which items considered <b>cultural</b> <b>properties</b> are contained. Several examples follow below: ...|$|R

25|$|Since {{the end of}} the 20th century, the Agency for Cultural Affairs {{has been}} {{focusing}} on the designation of structures built between 1868 and 1930 or in underrepresented regions. The agency realized the insufficient supply of raw materials and tools necessary for restoration works. In 1999 the protective authority was transferred to prefectures and designated cities. With the 2004 amendment, a system for Important Cultural Landscapes was established and Folk Techniques were added to the definition of Folk <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties.</b> Registered <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> was extended to include works of fine arts and crafts, Tangible <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> and Tangible Folk <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties.</b>|$|R
50|$|Designated Tangible <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> can then, if they satisfy certain criteria, be {{designated}} either as Important <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> of Japan (jūyō bunkazai) or as National Treasures (kokuhō), {{in the case}} of especially valuable items.|$|R
25|$|The {{two-tier system}} of National Treasures and Important <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> was {{supplemented}} with {{a new class of}} Registered <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties</b> meant for items in great need of preservation and use, initially limited to buildings and acting as a waiting list for the list of designated Important <b>Cultural</b> <b>Properties.</b> A large number of mainly industrial and historic residential from the late Edo to the Shōwa period were registered under this system.|$|R
