25|$|In August 2005, elderly Daisy Fuller {{is on her}} deathbed in a New Orleans {{hospital}} as Hurricane Katrina approaches. She starts rambling to her daughter, Caroline, about a train station built in 1918 and Mr. Gateau, the best clockmaker {{in all of the}} South, who was hired to make a clock for it. Mr. Gateau was blind, and lost his son in World War I, which crushed him, but he continued to labor over his clock. When it was unveiled at the station, the public was surprised to see that the clock ran backwards, to which Mr. Gateau says he made it that way so that the boys they lost in the war could <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again</b> and live their lives that were ended too soon. After that, Mr. Gateau was never seen again, and people speculated he died of a broken heart or went out to sea.|$|E
500|$|... "Mañana, Mañana" [...] {{was written}} and {{performed}} by Mexican singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel for his album Ella (1979). The recording features fellow Mexican singer Estela Núñez. Lyrically, it {{tells of the}} departure of a love who leaves tomorrow and will never <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again.</b> In 1994, Mexican recording artist Cristian Castro covered the song on his third studio album, El Camino del Alma, under the title [...] "Mañana". According to Gabriel, Castro had approached him to request recording the song for the album during Gabriel's hiatus from singing. Castro's version of the song was produced by Alejandro Zepeda and was released as the lead single from the album by Fonovisa. The music video for the song draws inspirations from the film, Dracula. In 2013, Castro re-recorded the song for his live album En Primera Fila: Día 1.|$|E
500|$|Other {{instrumentation}} for {{the song}} includes cello, which was played by a live orchestra. As the song moves towards the chorus, the piano sounds stop and the cello plays with Madonna belting out the lyrics: [...] "Deep in my heart, I'm concealing, Things that I'm longing to say, Scared to confess what I'm feeling, Frightened you'll slip away", when the piano and the orchestra sounds <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again.</b> It proceeds {{in the same way}} and gradually fades out. [...] "You Must Love Me" [...] is set in common time, with a moderate tempo of 92 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major, with Madonna's vocals spanning from G3 to B4. The song has a basic sequence of B–E/B–F/B–B in the beginning and changes to B–F when Madonna sings the opening verse [...] "Where do we go from here?".|$|E

500|$|With [...] "Waltz for Eva and Che", the soundtrack's {{atmosphere}} becomes tense, as Banderas and Madonna sing {{on top of}} {{bass and}} timpani. The bittersweet song [...] "You Must Love Me" [...] starts {{with the sound of}} orchestra and piano. Lyrically it talks about Eva's discovery that her husband Juan had actually loved her all along and not merely seen her as a political prop. As the song moves towards the chorus, the piano sounds stop and the cello plays with Madonna belting out the lyrics: [...] "Deep in my heart, I'm concealing, Things that I'm longing to say", when the piano and the orchestra sounds <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again.</b> It proceeds in the same way and gradually fades out. The final track, [...] "Lament", finds Madonna singing in a whispered tone, about Eva looking back at her life on her deathbed. Accompanied by classical guitar and harp, Banderas also sings over Eva's grave, and the track gradually fades out as an anti-climax.|$|E
500|$|For the song, {{which is}} a baroque pop ballad, Madonna uses a {{contrast}} of timbre, her higher smoother voice with her lower one. The song begins {{with the sound of}} violins for about 20seconds. After this, a drum machine, string arrangement and piano ushers on top of the violins, as Madonna sings the chorus line [...] "You can't hurt me now, I got away from you, I never thought I would." [...] The violins and the drum beats drop after the chorus, but <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again</b> during the next bridge. As Madonna sings the verse [...] "Oh father I have sinned", the violins change their pitch to a higher one. After the second chorus, there is an instrumental break where she sings about the realization that her father did not want to hurt her but she still ran away. The song ends with the guitar and violins fading out with Madonna's voice. In an interview with Paul Zollo, Madonna commented that the [...] "Father" [...] can refer to Tony, God or all the [...] "authorities in her life".|$|E
2500|$|In his {{official}} response to [...] the Hunter commission that enquired into the shooting, Dyer was unremorseful and stated: [...] "I think it {{quite possible that}} I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again</b> and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "And {{she went}}, and came": That is, {{she went out}} of the house where she was, and out of the city, and came into the field; though, {{according}} to the Midrash, she marked the ways as she went, before she entered into the field, and then came back to the city to observe the marks and signs she made, that she might not mistake the way, and might know how to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, a {{children}} performed a song at a kindergarten graduation ceremony in the West Bank which included these lyrics: [...] "If you stretch your hand, {{it will be}} chopped off. If you just look with your eye, it will be gouged out. ... We come for you before, and woe betide you if we <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again.</b> You come to this land alive, but you will leave it as body part." [...] Yasser Arafat's image accompanied the children on stage as they carried toy guns and wore uniforms. A woman's charity sponsored the ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|Former {{professional}} wrestler Adrian Street {{described in}} a November 2013 interview how [...] "Savile used {{to go on and}} on about the young girls who’d wait in line for him outside his dressing room... He'd pick the ones he wanted and say to the rest, 'Unlucky, <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again</b> tomorrow night'." [...] Savile, who cultivated a [...] "tough guy" [...] gimmick promoted by his entourage, was attacked with legitimate strikes during a 1971 bout with Street, who commented that had he [...] "known then the full extent of what I know about [...] now, I’d have given him an even bigger hiding – were that physically possible.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{religious}} references {{include the}} Old One, a Prometheus-like character who held great power but was chained and punished by the Architect for his interference with Her creations, including the liver being chopped out and regrown before the 'eagles' <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again,</b> {{only difference is}} that it is clockwork characters and they only chopped the liver previously, now they do eyeballs. (alternatively seen as a Lucifer character). However, the revelation in the final installment that the Old One was split from the entity of the Architect, and retained her powers, strongly suggest that he is a reference to God. The Drasil trees' name resembles that of the Norse [...] "World Tree", Yggdrasil.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 November, Dyer {{was called}} {{to appear before the}} Commission. Although his {{military}} superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone. Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, [...] "I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again</b> and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself." [...] Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of [...] "rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well".|$|E
2500|$|The old {{man came}} back after walking a {{distance}} and praised Zhang Liang, [...] "This child can be taught!" [...] and asked Zhang Liang {{to meet him at}} the bridge again at dawn five days later. Zhang Liang was confused but agreed. Five days later, Zhang Liang rushed to the bridge at the stroke of dawn but the old man was already waiting for him there. The old man chided him, [...] "How can you be late for a meeting with an elderly man? <b>Come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again</b> five days later!" [...] Zhang Liang tried his best to be punctual the second time but the old man still arrived earlier than him, and he was scorned by the old man once more and told to return again five days later. The third time, Zhang Liang went to the bridge at midnight and waited until the old man appeared. This time, the old man was impressed with Zhang Liang's fortitude and humility, that he presented Zhang with a book, saying, [...] "You can become the tutor of a ruler after reading this book. Within ten years, the world will become chaotic. You can then use your knowledge from this book to bring peace and prosperity to the empire. Meet me again 13 years later. I'm the yellow rock at the foot of Mount Gucheng." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 March a bugle call for action was sounded. The first batch of volunteers {{selected}} to offer Satyagraha were Kunjappy (Pulayan), Bahuleyan (Ezhava) and Venniyil Govinda Panicker (Nair). Before leaving the ashram, they were strictly instructed not to offer any resistance and remain calm against all provocations. The Satyagrahis, wearing khadi and Gandhi caps and garlands, marched forward with the Congress flag fluttering before them. All the volunteers followed them shouting [...] "Satyagraha ki jai, Mahatma Gandhi ki jai." [...] All of them would stop {{at a distance of}} fifty feet from the notice board, and only the selected three would walk {{to the point where the}} prohibition board hung. The police would stop them and ask them their caste. The police would pronounce that the low-caste men would not be allowed to pass; only the Savarnas could. The upper-caste men would insist that their companions should go with them. The police would prevent them. The Satyagrahis would wait there patiently until they were arrested just before noon. When they were produced before the court, invariably they were convicted and sentenced to jail and fined. They refused to pay the fine, and courted extra imprisonment. In the evening there would be a procession and public meeting, protesting against the arrest. The meetings were given wide publicity and people thronged in from all directions. They returned, rejuvenated by the inspiring speeches of the leaders to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>again</b> next morning to start the routine.|$|E
2500|$|Jones had {{a unique}} {{relationship}} with the town of St Andrews, Scotland. On his first appearance on the Old Course in The Open Championship of 1921, he withdrew after 11 holes in the third round, when he failed to complete the hole (in effect disqualifying himself), and tore up his scorecard, although he finished the round and indeed played the fourth round as well. He firmly stated his dislike for The Old Course and the town reciprocated, saying in the press, [...] "Master Bobby is just a boy, and an ordinary boy at that." [...] Later, he came to love the Old Course and the town like few others. When he won the Open at the Old Course in 1927, he wowed the crowd by asking that the trophy remain with his friends at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club rather than return with him to Atlanta. He won the British Amateur over The Old Course in 1930, and scored a double eagle 2 on the fourth hole (then a par-5, now a par-4), by holing a very long shot from a fairway bunker. In 1958, he was named a Freeman of the City of St Andrews, becoming only the second American to be so honored, the other being Benjamin Franklin in 1759. As Jones departed Younger Hall with his honor, the assembly spontaneously serenaded him off to the traditional tune of Will Ye No <b>Come</b> <b>Back</b> <b>Again?</b> in a famously moving tribute. Today, a scholarship exchange bearing the Jones name exists between the University of St Andrews and Emory University, Queen's University, The University of Western Ontario and the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. At Emory, four students are sent to St Andrews for an all-expenses-paid year of study and travel. In return, Emory accepts four students from St Andrews each year. The program, the Robert T. Jones Scholarship, {{is among the most}} unusual scholarships offered by any university.|$|E
