40|$|We have {{developed}} four cartridge test cryostats for ALMA FE cartridge-type re-ceiver with taking account of reliability and easy operation. It uses a simple, compact and efficient thermal link between a cartridge-type receiver {{and a plate}} connected to a 3 stage Gifford-Mcmahon (GM) cryocooler. The cooling time of the cartridge-type receiver is less than 10 hours. With a <b>cartridge</b> <b>loader,</b> a cartridge-type receiver is easily inserted and extracted in a condition that the cryostat is closed...|$|E
50|$|CH Haygarth & Sons, gun and rifle makers, are {{situated}} on the A836 {{on the eastern side}} of the village. It is Scotland's oldest practicing Gunmakers and <b>cartridge</b> <b>loaders,</b> and the only full-time Gunshop North of Inverness. The business was started in nearby Thurso by Colin Haygarth in April 1957. They are unusual in that it is still family owned and run by Colin's second son, Ross, marking the business's third generation of ownership by the Haygarth Clan. They were the Queen Mother's Gunsmiths from 1965 until her death in 2002. The building was the site of the original village shop, owned by the Begg family, which closed in the mid-1950s. The property was built in 1900.|$|R
40|$|Most modern high {{performance}} storage systems store data in large repositories of removable media volumes. Management of the removable volumes is {{performed by a}} software module known as a Physical Volume Library (PVL). To meet performance and scalability requirements, a PVL {{may be asked to}} mount multiple removable media volumes for use by a single client for parallel data transfer. Mounting sets of volumes creates an environment in which it impossible for multiple client requests to deadlock while attempting to gain access to storage resources. Scenarios leading to deadlock in a PVL include multiple client requests that contend for the same cartridge(s), and client requests that vie for a limited set of drive resources. These deadlock scenarios are further complicated by the potential for out-of-order volumes to be mounted (for example, by Automatic <b>Cartridge</b> <b>Loaders</b> or human operators). This paper begins by introducing those PVL requirements Which create the possibility of deadlock. Next we examine traditional approaches to deadlock resolution and how they might be applied in a PVL. This leads to a design for a PVL which addresses deadlock scenarios. Following the design presentation is a discussion of possible design enhancements. We end with a case study of an actual implementation of the PVL design in the High Performance Storage System (HPSS) ...|$|R
5000|$|Various {{software}} companies released fast loaders for the C64, usually in cartridge form. In the United States, {{probably the most}} popular such cartridge was the Epyx FastLoad. Most fast <b>loader</b> <b>cartridges</b> also incorporated other features to increase ease of use. An on-board implementation of Commodore's DOS Wedge was included in most fast <b>loader</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Machine language monitors, disk editors, and various convenience commands for Commodore BASIC were also common additions. Some fast <b>loader</b> <b>cartridges</b> were very sophisticated, incorporating a reset button, [...] "freeze" [...] capabilities, and a simple onboard GUI. The Final Cartridge III {{was perhaps the most}} successful of this genre. A few commercial fast loaders, most notably CMD's JiffyDOS, were not cartridge-driven but instead replaced the KERNAL ROM in the C64 and the DOS ROM in the 1541. While these were more difficult to install, they offered greatly increased compatibility, being almost invisible to software running on the machine.The cartridge, Action Replay MK6 RAM loader loads a 202 block program in around 9 seconds. Its Warp loader is 25 times faster, but programs can only be loaded with a loader saved to disk when the cartridge is not present.Whereas the ARMK6 fastloader was compatible with most software, the TFC III was known to crash often, so programs had to be loaded in normal C64 mode, deactivating the cartridge, making it more or less useless.|$|R
50|$|The Epyx Fast Load is {{a floppy}} disk fast <b>loader</b> <b>cartridge</b> made by American {{software}} company Epyx in 1984 for the Commodore 64 home computer. It was programmed by Epyx employee Scott Nelson, who was originally a programmer for Starpath and later designed the Epyx Vorpal fastloading {{system for the}} company's games.|$|R
