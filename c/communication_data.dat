40|$|Abstract- A Mobile Ad-Hoc Network is a wireless, selforganizing network {{where all}} clients and all servers are mobile and battery powered. Currently, most MANET {{research}} has been centered on data routing. Increasingly, <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> methods in MANET are being explored. A MANET allows <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> through <b>data</b> broadcast, data query, and peer-to-peer messages. One significant difficulty in assessing and comparing the different MANET <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> protocols proposed {{is the lack of}} a standard test environment or benchmark. A MANET <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> benchmark must include, at a minimum, a standard architecture, standard workload, and a standard set of evaluation parameters.

25|$|In {{computer}} science, graphs {{are used}} to represent networks of <b>communication,</b> <b>data</b> organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. For instance, the link structure of a website can be represented by a directed graph, in which the vertices represent web pages and directed edges represent links from one page to another. A similar approach {{can be taken to}} problems in social media, travel, biology, computer chip design, and many other fields. The development of algorithms to handle graphs is therefore of major interest in computer science. The transformation of graphs is often formalized and represented by graph rewrite systems. Complementary to graph transformation systems focusing on rule-based in-memory manipulation of graphs are graph databases geared towards transaction-safe, persistent storing and querying of graph-structured data.|$|E

Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. They are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. They can model many types of relations and process dynamics in physical, biological and social systems. In computer science, they can represent networks of <b>communication,</b> <b>data</b> organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. In mathematics, they are useful in geometry and certain parts of topology, e.g. knot theory. Algebraic graph theory has close links with group theory. There are also continuous graphs, however for the most part research in graph theory falls within the domain of discrete mathematics.|$|E

2500|$|Ed Offley, a {{reporter}} on military affairs, has closely followed developments in {{information concerning the}} sinking of the Scorpion. His most recent article on the subject is [...] "Buried at Sea" [...] published in the Winter 2008 issue of the Quarterly Journal of Military History. This article summarizes the facts in the case as presented in his 2007 book Scorpion Down: Sunk by the Soviets, Buried by the Pentagon: The Untold Story of the USS Scorpion. In the book Offley, gathering decades of his own research, hypothesizes that Scorpion was sunk by the Soviets, possibly in retaliation for the loss of K-129 earlier that year. The book paints a picture of increasing Soviet anger at U.S. Navy provocations— specifically, close-in monitoring of Soviet naval operations by almost every U.S. nuclear submarine. At approximately the same time, the Soviet intelligence community scored a huge boon in receiving the mechanical cryptologic devices from [...] These machines, combined with daily crypto keys from the John Anthony Walker spy ring, likely allowed the Soviets to monitor in real time U.S. Navy ship dispositions and communications. Offley contends that the Scorpion was tracked by several Soviet Navy assets from the Mediterranean to its final operational area south of the Azores, where it was then sunk by a Soviet torpedo. Ed Offley claims the US Navy was aware of the loss of the Scorpion on 21 May 1968 and engaged in [...] a massive coverup, within days destroying much of the sound and <b>communication</b> <b>data</b> at SOSUS ground stations in the US and Europe, and delaying any public indication of the loss until its scheduled arrival at Norfolk, Virginia 5 days later, partly to disguise the fact the US nuclear subs were in constant or frequent communication with US Naval Communication bases and that the subsequent search for the Scorpion was a five months deception to pretend they had no idea of the location of the hull. The oral testimony relied upon by Offley are recountings of surviving SOSUS recordings documenting torpedo sounds, evasion sounds, an explosion, and eventually the sounds of implosions as Scorpion plunged past crush depth. The Russian newspaper, Pravda, and television station RT, have attempted to discount Ed Offley as a provincial Seattle journalist and professor outside of and rejected by the inner Washington, NY loop of the US media.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is a {{group of}} wireless, mobile, {{battery-powered}} clients and servers that autonomously form temporary networks. Three <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> modes can be provided in a MANET, data broadcast, data query, and peer-to-peer messaging. Currently, no MANET <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> protocol provides the ability to use all MANET <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> modes. The objective of this research is to develop a MANET <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> protocol, TriM (for Tri-Modal communication), capable of providing all three <b>data</b> <b>communication</b> methods. TriM was designed to accommodate node disconnection and reconnection through periodic synchronization. Each part of the protocol has minimum power consumption as a goal. Simulation showed TriM minimizes the average power consumption of servers and clients while accommodating node disconnection. ...|$|R
