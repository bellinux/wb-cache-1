40|$|Abstract: The {{original}} Panjer recursion of the CreditRisk+ {{model is}} said to be unstable and therefore to yield inaccurate results of the tail distribution of <b>credit</b> <b>portfolios.</b> A much-hailed solution for the flaws of the Panjer recursion is the saddlepoint approximation method. In this paper we show that the saddlepoint approximation is an accurate and robust tool only for <b>credit</b> <b>portfolios</b> with low skewness and kurtosis of the loss distribution. However, often <b>credit</b> <b>portfolios</b> are heterogeneous with large skewness and kurtosis. We show that for such portfolios the commonly applied saddlepoint approximations (the Lugannani-Rice and the Barndorff-Nielsen formulas) are not reliable. We explain it by the dependence of the high-order standardized cumulants and the relative error on the saddlepoint. The more the cumulants and the relative error fluctuate for variations {{in the value of the}} saddlepoint (from 0 to the upper bound) the less accurate the saddlepoint approximation is. Hence, the saddlepoint approximations are not a universal substitute to the Panjer recursion algorithm. We also provide users of CR+ with a set of diagnostics to identify beforehand when the saddlepoint approximations are prone to failure...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of the financial system is associated with systemic risk {{factors such as the}} concurrent default of numerous small obligors. Hence it is of utmost importance to study the mutual dependence of losses for different creditors in the case of large, overlapping <b>credit</b> <b>portfolios.</b> We analytically calculate the multivariate joint loss distribution of several <b>credit</b> <b>portfolios</b> on a non-stationary market. To take fluctuating asset correlations into account we use an random matrix approach which preserves, as a much appreciated side effect, analytical tractability and drastically reduces the number of parameters. We show that for two disjoint <b>credit</b> <b>portfolios</b> diversification does not work in a correlated market. Additionally we find large concurrent portfolio losses to be rather likely. We show that significant correlations of the losses emerge not only for large portfolios with thousands of credit contracts but also for small portfolios consisting of a few credit contracts only. Furthermore we include subordination levels, which were established in collateralized debt obligations to protect the more senior tranches from high losses. We analytically corroborate the observation that an extreme loss of the subordinated creditor is likely to also yield a large loss of the senior creditor. Comment: 25 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Value-at-Risk {{is often}} used as a risk measure of <b>credit</b> <b>portfolios,</b> {{and it can be}} {{decomposed}} into a sum of risk contributions associated with individual obligors. These risk contributions {{play an important role in}} risk management of <b>credit</b> <b>portfolios.</b> They can be used to measure risk-adjusted performances of subportfolios and to allocate risk capital. Mathematically, risk contributions can be represented as conditional expectations, which are conditioned on rare events. In this paper, we develop a restricted importance sampling (IS) method for simulating risk contributions, and devise estimators whose mean square errors converge in a rate of n − 1. Furthermore, we combine our method with the IS method in the literature to improve the efficiency of the estimators. Numerical examples show that the proposed method works quite well. ...|$|R

40|$|Why are spreads on {{corporate}} bonds so wide relative to expected losses from default? The spread on Baa-rated bonds, for example, {{has been about}} four times the expected loss. We suggest that the most commonly cited explanations – taxes, liquidity and systematic diffusive risk – are inadequate. We argue instead that idiosyncratic default risk, or the risk of unexpected losses due to single- name defaults in necessarily "small" <b>credit</b> <b>portfolios,</b> accounts for the major part of spreads. Because return distributions are highly skewed, diversification would require very large portfolios. Evidence from arbitrage CDOs suggests that such diversification is not readily achievable in practice, and idiosyncratic risk is therefore unavoidable. Taking a cue from CDO subordination structures, we propose value-at-risk at the Aaa-rated confidence level as a summary measure of risk in feasible <b>credit</b> <b>portfolios.</b> We find evidence of a positive linear relationship between this risk measure and spreads {{on corporate}} bonds across rating classes. credit spread puzzle, jump-at-default risk, Sharpe ratio, collateralised debt obligation...|$|R
