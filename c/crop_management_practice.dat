40|$|This {{study is}} an {{exploration}} of agricultural decision-making and {{an investigation into the}} effects of different <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> on weed composition. The aim of this research is to enable the reconstruction of ancient <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> from archaeological weed assemblages and to inform archaeological interpretation, i. e. to interpret what the identified ancient <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> may imply. This particular Investigation focuses on con temporary and recent 'traditional' farmers in northern Jordan. The first aspect of this study looks at agricultural practice and agricultural decision making. In order to sustain agricultural production farmers rotate their crops - typically with a period of bare, or cultivated, fallow. The choice of crop rotation regime (and indeed, how crops are managed during the agricultural year) is affected not only by environmental factors but also by cultural and social factors. For example, contemporary farmers who own livestock often cultivate legume crops rather than practice fallow between wheat years. On the other hand, short-falls in labour can result in the elimination of legumes from a crop rotation regime. In the past 60 years, the system of land tenure in the study area has profoundly changed - from communal to private ownership - and this also has affected <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> The implications of these observations for archaeological Interpretation are assessed. The second aspect of this study examines the way different <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> affect weed composition. Although the main factor affecting weed composition was found to be vegetation zone, there was also some indication that <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> do indeed affect weed composition, but further substantiation is required. There is evidence that cultivated fallow favours the presence of weeds which can germinate in either autumn or spring whilst continuous cultivation encourages the establishment of perennial weeds. In both cases, tilage - the number of episodes and the timing of the operations - would seem to be the key factor. The way these results can be developed in the future are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Ethanol {{from various}} plant resources, {{especially}} maize, is increasingly {{being used as}} a substitute for fossil fuels. The production potential of ethanol from maize varies with weather and climatic conditions and <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> The merits and prospects of ethanol production have been evaluated based on its impact on greenhouse gas emissions, economic viability and national energy security. The net energy value (NEV), i. e. the output energy after all non-renewable energy inputs have been accounted for, is a measure of energy gain. At the same time, the NEV can be an indicator for the long-term sustainability of bio-ethanol production, regardless of other conditions e. g. climate change scenarios, global trade restrictions, or local variability in natural resources such as water availability. <b>Crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> directly affect the NEV of ethanol. Moreover, both <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and climate variability affect the NEV through the grain yield. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the impact of <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and climate variability on grain yield of maize for ethanol production and ethanol NEV for conditions that represent the southeastern USA. Maize grain yield was simulated with the dynamic crop growth model CSM-CERES-Maize and ethanol NEV was calculated using the simulated yield levels and <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices.</b> The simulations were conducted for conditions representing Mitchell County, Georgia, USA, using weather data from 1939 to 2006 and local soil profile information. The impact of irrigation, nitrogen fertilizer, planting date and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases were determined for the maize cultivars DeKalb DKC 61 - 72 (RR 2), Pioneer 31 D 58 and Pioneer 31 G 98. <b>Crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practices</b> and ENSO phase had a significant impact on ethanol feedstock production and NEV. The NEV of ethanol produced from irrigated maize was more than two times higher and varied less than the NEV of ethanol from rainfed maize.

Based on the data of questionnaire investigation in 2009 I selected four farms from the Pilsen Region. Evaluative criteria were as follows: the total area under cultivation, farming system (conventional or organic), type of arable crops (especially wheat, oat, potatoes). The data were extracted from terrain investigation, telephone conversations, interview with farmers, yearbook of organic farming, situational review and forecast balance of Czech Statistical Office and Ministry of Agriculture. Supporting data were extracted from ÚZEI database. Crop yields, the costs of crops and selling price in recent 10 years were investigated. From the results it can be concluded, that crop yields in organic farming are lower than crop yields in conventional farming. The yields of wheat growing in organic farming are 40 % lower than in conventional farming. The yields of potatoes growing in organic farming are 40 % lower than in conventional farming and the yields of oat growing in organic farming are 30 % lower than in conventional farming. Production efficiency of chosen crops in organic farming is comparable to conventional farming due to higher redemption price and lower costs.

Central to the suggestion of biochar benefits {{is an increase in}} soil nutrient availability and here we test this idea by examining crop nutrient uptake, growth and yields of field-grown spring barley, strawberry and potato. Biochar produced from Castanea sativa wood, was incorporated into a sandy loam soil at 0, 20 and 50 t ha- 1 as a supplement to standard <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practice.</b> Fertiliser was applied normally {{for each of the three}} crops. The biochar contained substantial concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, P, but only K occurred at high concentration in water soluble analysis. The large concentration of extractable K resulted in a significant increase of extractable K in soil. The increased availability of K in biochar-treated soil, with the exception of spring barley grain and the leaves of strawberry during the second year, did not induce greater tissue concentrations. In general, biochar application rate had little influence on the tissue concentration of any nutrient, irrespective of crop or sampling date. There was, however, evidence of a biochar-induced increase in tissue Mo and a decrease in Mn, in strawberry, which could be linked to soil alkalinisation as could the reduction in extractable soil P. These experiments show a single rotational application of biochar to soil had no effect on the growth or harvest yield of any of these field-grown crops.

40|$|Increasing {{global demand}} for biofuel has {{accelerated}} land-use change (LUC) in Brazil, primarily through the planting of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) to replace degraded pastures.

Through decades of research focusing on identifying sensitive indicators of soil degradation due to land use and management, the Visual Evaluation of Soil Structure (VESS) method {{has emerged as a}} simple, fast, reliable and accurate semi-quantitative approach for assessing soil structure changes. VESS integrates soil properties related to size, strength and porosity of aggregates, and root characteristics into a single score (Sq – structural quality) that ranges from 1 (good structural quality) to 5 (poor structural quality). Although the VESS method was developed for temperate soils, it has been used successfully as an indicator of soil and <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> effects on structural quality of tropical and subtropical soils. Our objectives were to evaluate soil structural quality changes associated with a LUC sequence (i. e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) at three sites under Oxisols, Alfisols and Ultisols across centralsouthern Brazil using the VESS; and to correlate VESS scores with quantitative measurements of soil physical properties. Average VESS scores were 2. 0, 2. 7, and 3. 1 for native vegetation, pasture, and sugarcane, respectively. Overall the VESS method was able to detect soil structural quality changes under LUC for sugarcane cultivation, indicating a decrease in soil quality from native vegetation through pasture to sugarcane. The VESS scores were significantly correlated with quantitative soil physical property measurements, suggesting VESS is a reliable indicator of soil structural quality in tropical soils. A VESS score Sq = 3. 0 seems to be suitable as a guide for management decisions. We conclude that VESS scores provide an efficient method to identify impacts of sugarcane expansion on soil structural quality, and recommend that VESS assessment be incorporated into monitoring protocols for evaluating not only sugarcane expansion areas, but also overall soil quality/health in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) crops with soil species and ecosystems is complex, requiring both specific and broad spectrum assessments. In the ECOGEN project we undertook experiments at three scales of increasing complexity, using Bt maize expressing the Cry 1 Ab protein from Bacillus thuringiensis as an example. Test species were selected for laboratory-scale experiments to represent taxonomic groups that we could also monitor at glasshouse and field scales (e. g., nematodes, protozoa, micro-arthropods, earthworms, and snails). In the laboratory, single species were exposed to purified Cry 1 Ab protein or to Bt maize leaf powder incorporated into simplified diets under controlled conditions. In the glasshouse, multiple test species and soil microbial communities taken from ECOGEN's field sites were exposed to Bt maize plants growing under glasshouse or mesocosm conditions. In the field, evaluations were conducted on our selected indicator groups over multiple sites and growing seasons. Field evaluation included assessment of effects due to the local environment, crop type, seasonal variation and conventional <b>crop</b> <b>management</b> <b>practice</b> (tillage and pesticide use), which cannot be assessed in the glasshouse. No direct effects of Cry 1 Ab protein or Bt leaf residues were detected on our laboratory test organisms, but some significant effects were detected in the glasshouse. Total nematode and protozoan numbers increased in field soil under Bt maize relative to conventional maize, whilst microbial community structure and activity were unaffected. Field results for the abundance of nematodes and protozoa showed some negative effects of Bt maize, thus contradicting the glasshouse results. However, these negative results were specific to particular field sites and sampling times and therefore were transient. Taking the overall variation found in maize ecosystems at different sites into account, any negative effects of Bt maize at field scale were judged to be indirect and no greater than the impacts of crop type, tillage and pesticide use. Although the ECOGEN results were not predictive between the three experimental scales, we propose that they have value when used with feedback loops between the scales.
