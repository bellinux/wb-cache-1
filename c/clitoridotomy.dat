50|$|Clitoral hood reduction, also termed {{clitoral}} hoodectomy, clitoral unhooding, <b>clitoridotomy,</b> or (partial) hoodectomy, {{is a form}} of hoodplasty. When {{performed with}} the consent of the adult individual, it can be considered an elective plastic surgery procedure for reducing the size and the area of the clitoral hood (prepuce) in order to further expose the clitoral glans of the clitoris; the therapeutic goal is thought to improve the sexual functioning of the woman, and the aesthetic appeal of her vulva. The reduction of the clitoral prepuce tissues usually is a sub-ordinate surgery within a labiaplasty procedure for reducing the labia minora; and occasionally within a vaginoplasty procedure. When these procedures are performed on individuals without their consent, they are considered a form of female genital mutilation.|$|E
