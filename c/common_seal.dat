40|$|The outer {{coastline}} from Bømlafjorden to Jæren and Lysefjorden in Rogaland {{were surveyed}} 29 May- 5 June. Another survey {{was carried out}} {{on the coast of}} Finnmark from Varangerfjorden to Sørøya 26 June- 7 July 1981. In Rogaland a total of 75 <b>common</b> <b>seals</b> was recorded. The seals were most abundant in the Kvitsøy-Håsteinen area (38 seals) and in Lysefjorden (27 seals). In Kongsfjorden, Finnmark, 23 pups were observed (corresponding to a total stock in excess of 100 seals). Another colony of <b>common</b> <b>seals</b> was found at Sørøya (20 <b>seals),</b> and <b>common</b> <b>seals</b> were also seen in Varangerfjorden, Tanafjorden and Kobbfjorden. Concentrations of grey seals were found in the Espevær-Utsira area (36 seals) and at Kjør (60 seals) in Rogaland, and in Syltefjorden (40 seals) and at Sørøya (70 seals) in Finnmark. Scattered seals or small groups were also seen outside these areas. Due to adverse weather conditions very few <b>common</b> <b>seals</b> were observed during the surveys, and the numbers recorded probably are significantly lower than actual stocks. So far, the available data are insufficient to assess the stocks of <b>common</b> <b>seals</b> in Rogaland and Finnmark. However, the observations of grey seals indicate an increase from assessed stocks in the early 1960 -ies. Stomachs from a total of ten <b>common</b> <b>seals</b> and nine grey seals were examined during the surveys. Haddock, sand eels and flatfishes were identified in the <b>common</b> <b>seals,</b> while the grey seal stomachs contained catfish, saithe, haddock, herring, lumpsucker, sand eels and flatfishes. The maximum volume of stomach contents found in a common sea 1 was 4 1, and volumes up to 6 l were recorded in grey seals. The average infestation of parasitic nematodes in the stomachs of examined <b>common</b> <b>seals</b> was 64 worms, while the average infestation in the grey seals was 492 worms. An aerial survey to count whitecoated grey seal pups was carried out 7 November in Rogaland. No pup or concentration of grey seals was observed, and if grey seals do produce pups in Rogaland, pupping probably occurs in early Octoher. Aerial surveys were also carried out along the coast of Finnmark 28 and 29 October. No grey seal pup was found, and the surveys were repeated 17 - 20 November. At that time concentrations of grey seals were ohserved on shore at the presumed breeding localities. It therefore seems likely that pupping in Finnmark occurs later than 20 November...|$|R

25|$|Bruges's {{appointment}} {{as the first}} Garter King of Arms coincided {{with a series of}} moves to regulate heraldic matters.

In January 1421 the English heralds held their first chapter and directed that a <b>common</b> <b>seal</b> for that office be made. Resolutions were to govern the office of arms and its members, with chapters summoned by Garter.

40|$|The Seal Rehabilitation and Research Centre (SRRC) in Pieterburen, The Netherlands, rehabilitates seals {{from the}} waters of the Wadden Sea, North Sea and Southwest Delta area. Incidental {{observations}} of albinism and melanism in <b>common</b> and grey <b>seals</b> are known from countries surrounding the North Sea. However, observations on colour aberrations have not been systematically recorded.

60|$|The {{council was}} convened the day {{succeeding}} its election. After a few preliminary matters were disposed of, the great question was laid before it, of {{a division of}} property, and the grant of real estate. Warrington and Charles Woolston laid down the theory, that the fee of all the land was, by gift of Providence, in the governor, and that his patent, or sign-manual, was necessary for passing the title into other hands. This theory had an affinity {{to that of the}} Common Law, which made the prince the suzerain, and rendered him the heir of all escheated estates. But Mark's humility, not to say his justice, met this doctrine on the threshold. He admitted the sovereignty and its right, but placed it {{in the body of the}} colony, instead of in himself. As the party most interested took this view of the case, they who were disposed to regard his rights as more sweeping, were fain to submit. The land was therefore declared to be the property of the state. Ample grants, however, were made both to the governor and Betts, as original possessors, or discoverers, and it was held in law that their claims were thus compromised. The grants to Governor Woolston included quite a thousand acres on the Peak, which was computed to contain near thirty thousand, and an island of about the same extent in the group, which was beautifully situated near its centre, and less than a league from the crater. Betts had one hundred acres granted to him, near the crater also. He refused any other grant, as a right growing out of original possession. Nor was his reasoning bad on the occasion. When he was driven off, in the Neshamony, the Reef, Loam Island, Guano Island, and twenty or thirty rocks, composed all the dry land. He had never seen the Peak until Mark was in possession of it, and had no particular claim there. When the council came to make its general grants, he was willing to come in for his proper share with the rest of the people, and he wanted no more. Heaton had a special grant of two hundred acres made to him on the Peak, and another in the group of equal extent, as a reward for his early and important services. Patents were made out, at once, of these several grants, under the great seal of the colony; for the governor had provided parchment, and wax, and a <b>common</b> <b>seal,</b> in anticipation of their being all wanted. The rest of the grants of land were made on a general principle, giving fifty acres on the Peak, and one hundred in the group, to each male citizen of the age of twenty-one years; those who had not yet attained their majority being compelled to wait. A survey was made, and the different lots were numbered, and registered by those numbers. Then a lottery, was made, each man's name being put in one box, and the necessary numbers in another. The number drawn against any particular name was the lot of the person in question. A registration of the drawing was taken, and printed patents were made out, signed, sealed, and issued to the respective parties. We say printed, a press and types having been brought over in the Rancocus, as well as a printer. In this way, then, every male of full age, was put in possession of one hundred and fifty acres of land, in fee.|$|E
