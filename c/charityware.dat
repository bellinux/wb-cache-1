50|$|Bram {{promotes}} {{charity and}} {{encourages people to}} support orphans in Uganda. He pioneered a methodology called <b>charityware</b> through his Vim editor. The software itself is available for free, but it encourages the user to donate to the programmer's favorite charity. A number of other applications have been licensed this way {{since the inception of}} this concept.|$|E
50|$|For example, the vim {{text editor}} is free {{software}} but includes {{a request from}} its author, Bram Moolenaar, that users donate to ICCF Holland for work to help AIDS victims in Uganda. Vim's <b>Charityware</b> license has been declared by Richard Stallman to be GPL-compatible. Another current example is MJ's CD Archiver, a file archiver for Microsoft Windows/Linux/Mac OS X. The suggested charity is NACEF, a US-registered charity for China's Project Hope.|$|E
50|$|Careware (also called <b>charityware,</b> helpware, or goodware) is {{software}} licensed in a {{way that}} benefits a charity. Some careware is distributed free, and the author suggests that some payment be made to either a nominated charity, or a charity of the user's choice. Commercial careware, on the other hand, includes a levy for charity on top of the distribution charge. It can also be a barter of some kind, or even a pledge to be kind to strangers.|$|E

Weinbaum, Rudyard Kipling, and William Hope Hodgson.|$|E

It {{was written by}} Bram Moolenaar based on source for a port of the Stevie editor to the Amiga and first released publicly in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. Vim is free and open source software and is released under a license that includes some <b>charityware</b> clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in Uganda. The license {{is compatible with the}} GNU General Public License through a special clause allowing distribution of modified copies [...] "under the GNU GPL version 2 or any later version".|$|E
