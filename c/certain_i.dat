[...] When Schembechler won the Big Ten championship in 1969, he said, [...] "I made <b>certain</b> <b>I</b> let everyone know I won with Bump's kids. [...] Bump was a man of great class and he showed it to me again and again in that first year, never getting in the way, always trying to be helpful, always trying to encourage me." [...] After Michigan won the 1969 Ohio State game, the team presented the game ball to Elliott, and Schembechler noted that [...] "I don’t remember when I felt happier about anything in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Historian Will Jacobs {{suggests}} the Silver Age ended in April 1970 {{when the man}} who had started it, Julius Schwartz, handed over Green Lantern — starring one of the first revived heroes of the era [...] — to the new-guard team of Denny O'Neil and Neal Adams in response to reduced sales. John Strausbaugh also connects the end of the Silver Age to Green Lantern. He observes that in 1960, the character embodied the can-do optimism of the era. [...] However, by 1972 Green Lantern had become world weary; [...] "Those days are gone – gone forever – the days I was confident, <b>certain</b> ... <b>I</b> was so young ... so sure I couldn't make a mistake! Young and cocky, that was Green Lantern. Well, I've changed. I'm older now ... maybe wiser, too ... and a lot less happy." [...] Strausbaugh writes that the Silver Age [...] "went out with that whimper." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the 25th Infantry Division's Tropic Lightning Museum, 14 {{different}} American {{pilots were}} able to take off during the surprise attack and record 10 Japanese aircraft kills. Air Corps records credit Welch with four kills and Taylor with two, yet new research of Japanese combat reports confirms Taylor got four kills (when the two probable kills are included). Taylor claimed in an interview: [...] "I know for <b>certain</b> <b>I</b> shot down two planes or perhaps more; I don't know." [...] On the 13th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, the United States Air Force stated that they could not determine which of the two pilots shot down the first Japanese bomber: [...] "Each of them in his first attack shot down an enemy bomber, so the difference in time would have been but a few seconds in any case." [...] While in the air during the dogfight, the two pilots agreed that whoever survived the battle would claim credit to the title for the first kill. However, both pilots survived and because Welch outranked Taylor (he was a 41A, Taylor a 41C) and was the lead aircraft in the fight, he was credited with the first kill. The efforts of the two pilots’ dogfights {{were able to}} divert the Japanese from destroying the Haleiwa air field, which the Japanese intelligence did not know about prior to the attack. Taylor later reacted to the attack, saying [...] "I believed I was a better-trained pilot than the enemy. I had good equipment, and I was proud of it." ...|$|E

500|$|In Haygarth's Cricket Scores and Biographies, Roe is {{described}} as a [...] "fine, free hitter with excellent defence", who could also [...] "bowl a very useful medium-paced ball". He got more of a go at Cambridge during his third year, playing five matches for the university side in 1882. Roe, who was known for his cricket tales, related a tale from one match that season in which the weather was so cold that catches were difficult to take. George Nash, the Lancashire professional, was missed off every ball of an over from Robert Ramsay. [...] "C. T. Studd bowled the next ball, and a catch came to me at mid-off, the crowd began to boo, and I felt <b>certain</b> <b>I</b> should not make the catch, but by great good fortune the ball stuck!" [...] Roe did not excel with bat or ball in any of his five university matches, and was not selected for the match against Oxford University {{at the end of the}} season. In his final year at Cambridge, Roe played seven times for the university, and achieved his Blue—the awarding of the Cambridge [...] "colours" [...] to sportsmen—by appearing in the University match against Oxford. He was out without scoring any runs in his only innings of the match, which Cambridge won by seven wickets. In all, during his time at Cambridge, Roe played 13 first-class matches for the university, scoring 246 runs at an average of 11.18, with just one score greater than 50. He also took ten wickets at 15.60.|$|E
