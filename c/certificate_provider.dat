40|$|The {{ability to}} {{communicate}} securely is needed for many network applications. Public key infrastructure (PKI) is the most extended solution to verify and confirm the identity of each party involved in any secure transaction and transfer trust over the network. One of the hardest tasks of a certification infrastructure is to manage revocation. Research on this topic {{has focused on the}} trade-offs that different revocation mechanisms offer. However, less effort has been paid to understand the benefits of improving the revocation policies. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of the oligopoly of <b>certificate</b> <b>providers</b> that issue digital certificates to clients facing identical independent risks.

50|$|The {{most common}} use of {{certificates}} is for HTTPS-based web sites. A web browser validates that an HTTPS web server is authentic, {{so that the}} user can feel secure that his/her interaction with the web site has no eavesdroppers and that the web site is who it claims to be. This security is important for electronic commerce. In practice, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a certificate signing request. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The <b>certificate</b> <b>provider</b> signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects {{to the web site}} and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how to resign Jar files. Jar files (Java archives) {{are used by}} technologies (like Java Web Start) to deploy applications that are run with increased privileges. The Jar files are signed with certificates that generally expire after a year. The annual resigning of the files is therefore an event that occurs after the signer has forgotten how resigning is done. Manual resigning of Jar files is a tedious and error-prone task. All the more so when {{there are many of}} them. This article shows how to automate the task. Considering that I have over 250 Jar files that have to be resigned each year, a manual task is not an option. The methodology for resigning a Jar file cannot include signing the Jar file twice. Jar files that are signed twice create an error during verification. Unsigning a Jar file is not a straightforward task. Thus, our approach is to expand the Jar file, remove the expired certificate and then repack and resign the Jar file with the new certificate. We also show how to obtain a new certificate, from a free <b>certificate</b> <b>provider.</b> This paper addresses a sub-problem of the Initium project, a joint, on-going project between the Fairfield University and the DocJava, Inc.

The results of this design time analysis can be used as <b>certificate</b> by Cloud <b>providers</b> to signal compliance. Auditors can check the rule adherence of workflows before workflow execution, and thanks to the rule patterns certification is open to scrutiny by customers.

40|$|Abstract. In 1999 the {{directive}} 1999 / 93 /EC of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council was enacted, providing a legal framework for a common introduc-tion of electronic signatures in Europe. So far the signature market has failed miserably. Mobile electronic signatures could be a potential and promising way to increase the market acceptance of electronic signatures. In this contribution we used an infrastructure for qualified mobile electronic signatures proposed in [Ross 2004] {{as the basis of}} our assumptions. This infrastructure does not require the mobile operator to act as a <b>certificate</b> service <b>provider</b> (CSP). Instead the user can freely choose a CSP and add the signature functionality along with the required certificates later on demand. The mobile operator would act as the card issuer and would only profit from traffic caused by signature applications. However, mobile operators will only enter the signature market if they expect a profit in return. Therefore, {{we take a look at}} the economic feasibility of mobile qualified electronic signatures from the viewpoint of a mobile operator (MO) and try to predict the return on investment. Also, the CSP will only accept this infrastructure, by giving up the control over the signature card, if profits can be expected. Therefore, we examine potential revenue sources for CSPs, using new business models proposed in [LiRo 2005] that have the potential to be far more successful than the current ones. Our prediction shows that mobile quali-fied electronic signatures can be quite profitable for both parties. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Errors in the {{measurement}} of the timing and number of prenatal care visits may produce downward bias in estimates {{of the impact of}} prenatal care use on birth outcomes. This paper examines the extent of attenuation bias from measurement error in the estimation of the effect of prenatal care use on birth weight. Methods: Data were analyzed from the 1980 National Natality Survey, a nationally representative sample of live births with information on prenatal care utilization from three sources: birth <b>certificates,</b> medical <b>provider</b> surveys, and maternal surveys. The extent of attenuation bias in estimates of the impact of different measures of prenatal care use on birth weight was examined by comparing estimates robust to measurement error (including instrumental variables) with ordinary least squares results. Results: There is considerable disagreement in measures of prenatal care across the three data sources, with correlations in the utilization measures computed from different sources around 0. 5. The results also show evidence of attenuation bias from measurement error in estimates of the impact of prenatal care on birth weight for both White and Black mothers. Attenuation bias was least severe for information from the birth certificate report of prenatal care. Conclusions: Because of measurement error, previous studies may have underestimated the effect of prenatal care utilization on birth weight. Corrected estimates, however, do not suggest that prenatal care is a major predictor of birth weight. In addition, part of what previous analyses have interpreted as adverse selection bias may in fact be attenuation bias due to measurement error.
