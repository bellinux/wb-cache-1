50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>myna</b> (Acridotheres cristatellus) is {{a species}} of {{starling}} native to southeastern China and Indochina. Unlike other similar mynas, its bill is dull whitish rather than orange-yellow.|$|E
50|$|Around 1890, the <b>crested</b> <b>myna</b> was {{introduced}} into the Vancouver region of British Columbia. It was initially successful, reaching a population in the thousands, without spreading far from the Lower Mainland. By the mid-twentieth century, numbers began declining, and the bird is now extirpated in North America.|$|E
50|$|Bird species include: great argus, little green-pigeon, white-rumped shama, white-bellied woodpecker, <b>crested</b> serpent-eagle, Hill <b>myna,</b> helmeted hornbill, {{wrinkled}} hornbill, white-winged wood duck, Storm's stork, garnet pitta and grey-breasted babbler.|$|R
40|$|The {{common myna}} Acridotheres tristis is listed among the world’s 100 worst {{invasive}} alien species. We combined previous records with a field survey {{to update the}} extent and fate of myna introductions in Spain and Portugal. Results suggest {{that there have been}} at least 22 independent accidental introductions of three myna species throughout the Iberian peninsula and three archipelagos since the early 1990 s. While bank mynas (A. ginginianus) did not become established elsewhere, common mynas reached breeding populations on four islands. Eradication efforts allowed the extirpation of these breeding island populations, but common mynas continue to breed in the Tagus Estuary (continental Portugal). In this region, there is also a breeding population of <b>crested</b> <b>mynas</b> (A. cristatellus), which was undergone an exponential population growth in the last decade. To avoid further accidental introductions, eradication campaigns should be combined with preventive actions aiming to stop the trade of these species in Europe...|$|R

5000|$|Acridotheres is a genus of starlings, the [...] "typical" [...] mynas, {{which are}} {{tropical}} {{members of the}} family Sturnidae. This genus has representatives in tropical southern Asia from Iran east to southern China and Indonesia. Two species have been introduced widely elsewhere.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Patterns of {{resource}} partitioning among 4 sympatric sturnids: [black-collared starling (Sturnus nigricollis), pied starling (S. contra), common myna (Acridotheres tristis) and <b>crested</b> <b>myna</b> (A. javanicus) were determined {{based on their}} food habits, foraging and nesting microhabitat selection, morphology and behavior. The study was conducted from March 1986 to June 1988 at and around Bang Pra Game Sanctuary, Cholburi, Thailand. Diets of adults and nestlings of all species were significantly different. The 4 species exhibited significant differences in morphology, primarily in trophic (bill shape and length) and locomotive (wing shape and size) appendages that affect selection of foraging microhabitat and hence choice of diets. Selection of nest site characteristics was significantly different among the species and was associated with types of tree i. e., palm vs non-palm (trees with forks or branches), distance of nest tree from human habitation and distance of nest tree from seasonal or permanent waters. The pied starling, common myna and <b>crested</b> <b>myna</b> all selected different foraging habitats and used different techniques for foraging,-however the black-collared starling shared foraging habitat with the other 3 species. Breeding success, breeding chronology, and clutch sizes were similar for the 4 species. These 4 sympatric sturnids partitioned their resources through differences in morphology, which, in turn, affected their foraging habitat selection and modes of foraging, and hence, differences in diet. Behavioral differences also segregated their foraging techniques and nest site selection...|$|E
40|$|Long Valley is {{the largest}} {{agricultural}} wetland in Hong Kong and supports {{a high level of}} biodiversity. The implementation of Management Agreement project in Long Valley has successfully enhanced its conservation value through habitat management and various eco-agricultural practices. However, the conflict between profitable agricultural yield and bird conservation in the area has also been intensifying as reflected by the increasing number of complaints of bird-related crop damage from local farmers in winter. The study aimed to assess the extent and impact of crop damage caused by birds in Long Valley during winter. The first part of the study involved a transect survey in the area reported to be the most severely affected area of Long Valley to determine the bird diversity and abundance, also the environmental factors of individual farmland plots were collected for analysis of their relationship with bird distribution. The bird species responsible for crop damage (targeted species) were also identified. The second part of the study evaluated the impact of different targeted species by using the technique of focal animal sampling, which involved focused observation of individual bird’s behaviour in the field and to quantify its time budget spent on crop-damaging behaviour. In order to understand the perspectives from farmers, face-to-face interviews with farmers practicing in the area were also conducted. The study identified five species to have crop-damaging behaviour, which can be further divided into two groups: the crop-consuming species causing actual crop damage included Chinese Bulbul (Pycnonotus sinensis), <b>Crested</b> <b>Myna</b> (Acridotheres cristatellus) and Eurasian Tree Sparrow(Passer montanus). The incidental crop-pecking species causing minimal crop damage included the White Wagtail (Motacilla alba) and Yellow Wagtail (Motacilla tschutschensis). Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) was the only type of crop suffering from bird damage. The intensity of crop-damaging behaviour of a species was estimated by the mean time allocated in crop consumption, and was found to be 66. 7 %± 7. 3 % in Chinese Bulbul, 31. 6 %± 29. 1 % in Eurasian Tree Sparrow and 8. 9 %± 12. 0 % in <b>Crested</b> <b>Myna.</b> However, taking into account of the abundance, distribution and activity record of a species, <b>Crested</b> <b>Myna</b> showed the greatest overall impact to the vegetable crops. Chinese Bulbul showed a relatively focal but intensive damage to a few plots. It was found that having wires and a wet field nearby the plots were significant determinants of the presence of Eurasian Tree Sparrow. And the presence of Chinese Bulbul was significantly {{associated with the use of}} bird deterrents. <b>Crested</b> <b>Myna</b> was found in significantly higher numbers in late afternoon and was associated with plots having the seedling stage of lettuce growth. The study shows that birds do cause localized and patchy damage to vegetable crops in Long Valley. Individual farmlands may exhibit variations in severity of the damage due to the difference in species distribution and environmental factors. The management of bird damage must therefore be individualized from plot to plot. Also education and engagement with local farmers are indispensable to maintaining sustainable agricultural development while conserving avifauna in Long Valley. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E
40|$|The study aims at {{quantifying}} trade {{scale of}} some economically wild birds and describing captured trends {{which have been}} practised by wild bird catchers. The {{study was conducted in}} Tanah Grogot, Paser District, East Kalimantan Province, from September to December 2008, by surveying wild bird market and interviewing catchers and sellers. We measured two main attributes of market dynamics; first, each species availability in the market as the percentage of market days sampled where the species appeared; second, daily abundance of a species as the monthly average number of each bird per day for all days sampled. Seven wild bird species that have been traded commodities for years were White-rumped Shama Copsychus malabaricus (25. 41 %; 602. 25 + 70. 79 individuals per month), Yellow-vented Bulbul Pycnonotus goiavier (11. 47 %; 111. 25 + 12. 50 individuals per month), <b>Crested</b> <b>Myna</b> Acridotheres cristatellus (12. 30 %; 73. 25 + 10. 44 individuals per month), Spotted Dove Streptopelia chinensis (5. 73 %; 22. 00 + 12. 83 individuals per month), Hill Myna Gracula religiosa (12. 30 %; 12. 00 + 0. 82 individuals per month), Greater Green Leafbird Chloropsis sonneratii (7. 38 %; 11. 75 + 2. 50 individuals per month) and Magpie Robin Copsychus saularis (6. 56 %; 8. 75 + 1. 71 individualsper month). Specific capture location within Paser District could reflect distribution and habitat preference of each bird species...|$|E
