5|$|Alexander Bain, a Scottish {{clock and}} {{instrument}} maker, {{was the first}} to invent and patent the electric <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> which an electromagnetic pendulum and an electric current is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.|$|E
5|$|Classes {{began at}} 8:30 that morning. Kehoe had set an alarm <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> the {{basement}} of the north wing of the school, and remotely detonated the dynamite and pyrotol which he had hidden there at about 8:45a.m.|$|E
5|$|In {{the north}} {{transept}} is Wells Cathedral clock, an astronomical clock from about 1325, {{believed to be}} the work of Peter Lightfoot, a monk of Glastonbury. Its mechanism, dated to between 1386 and 1392, was replaced in the 19th century, and the original mechanism moved to the Science Museum in London, where it continues to operate. It is the second-oldest surviving <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> England, after the Salisbury cathedral clock.|$|E

5|$|To {{facilitate}} foreign {{athletes and}} officials, four immigration counters {{were set up}} at the airport. A time limit of 30 minutes was laid down to clear any athlete or official. To improve security speed, six interpreters of Russian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, French and Arabic were present at the airport. In addition, 24 specially trained immigration personnel were stationed round the <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> the airport.|$|E
5|$|Al-Zarqali (1028–1087) {{developed}} {{a more accurate}} astrolabe, used for centuries afterwards. He constructed a water <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> Toledo. He discovered that the Sun's apogee moves slowly relative to the fixed stars, and obtained a good estimate of its motion for its rate of change. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) wrote an important revision to Ptolemy's celestial model. When he became Helagu's astrologer, he was given an observatory and gained access to Chinese techniques and observations. He developed trigonometry as a separate field, and compiled the most accurate astronomical tables available up to that time.|$|E

5|$|Another {{development}} was the Dreyer Fire-control Table that combined {{the functions of}} the Dumaresq and the range <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> the transmission stations. Hercules was probably fitted with a prototype table when its inventor, Commander Frederic Dreyer, was assigned to the ship at the end of 1911. The ship retained that instrument at least until February 1916, although it had been replaced by a Mark I table by 1918. Colossus received her Mark I table by early 1916.|$|E
5|$|Between 1794 and 1795, in the {{aftermath}} of the French Revolution, the French government briefly mandated decimal clocks, with a day divided into 10hours of 100minutes each. The astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, among other individuals, modified the dial of his pocket watch to decimal time. A <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> the Palais des Tuileries kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread. Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the metric system, and it was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Edward built further luxurious, {{self-contained}} lodgings for {{his court}} around {{the east and}} south edges of the Upper Ward, creating the modern shape of the quadrangle. The Norman gate was built to secure the west entrance to the Ward. In the Lower Ward, the chapel was enlarged and remodelled with grand buildings for the canons built alongside. The earliest weight-driven mechanical <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> England was installed by Edward III in the Round Tower in 1354. William of Wykeham went on to build New College, Oxford and Winchester College, where the influence of Windsor Castle can easily be seen.|$|E

The longcase clock inflicted a severe wound {{to the back of}} Cornwell's head. He received first aid treatment from a physician present at the residence and was taken to his Winchester home where he regained consciousness.|$|E
5|$|In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, {{defending}} team {{players are}} allowed {{to stay on the}} key for an unlimited amount of time. In American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot <b>clock.</b> <b>In</b> all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.|$|E
5|$|In Super Mario Kart, {{the player}} takes control {{of one of}} eight Mario series characters, each with differing capabilities. In single player mode players can race against {{computer-controlled}} characters in multi-race cups over three difficulty levels. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power-ups {{can be used to}} gain an advantage. Alternatively players can race against the <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> a Time Trial mode. In multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups or can race against each other one-on-one in Match Race mode. In a third multiplayer mode – Battle Mode – the aim is to defeat the other players by attacking them with power-ups, destroying balloons which surround each kart.|$|E

5|$|The {{appearance}} of clocks in {{writings of the}} 11th century implies that they were well known in Europe in that period. In the early 14th-century, the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri referred to a <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> his Paradiso; the first known literary reference to a clock that struck the hours. Giovanni da Dondi, Professor of Astronomy at Padua, presented the earliest detailed description of clockwork in his 1364 treatise Il Tractatus Astrarii. This has inspired several modern replicas, including some in London's Science Museum and the Smithsonian Institution. Other notable examples from this period were built in Milan (1335), Strasbourg (1354), Lund (1380), Rouen (1389), and Prague (1462).|$|E
5|$|The north transept, {{which had}} {{previously}} {{served as a}} vestry from which the Poor Law was administered, was used to house the church's William Hill & Son organ, which had been installed in 1852 in the now-removed western gallery; the south transept, which up to that date had {{been used as a}} mausoleum for the Cavendish family and was completely walled {{off from the rest of}} the church and accessible only via its own door from the churchyard, was opened up to the church. In 1890 Cambridge Chimes were added to the tower <b>clock,</b> <b>in</b> commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} positive reviews, peaking {{at eighteen}} in the United States, and charting on other U.S. charts, including {{the top ten}} of the Pop Songs. It also charted abroad in Canada and New Zealand. The song's accompanying music video, which {{takes place in a}} desert and features a countdown <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with the song's meaning, was received warmly, and according to critics, was an end to the low-budget, storyline-centered, debut music videos from previous American Idol alumni.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Andrew Felton (born 22 September 1987) is an English actor. Felton began {{appearing}} in commercials {{when he was}} eight years old for companies such as Commercial Union and Barclaycard. He made his screen debut in the role of Peagreen <b>Clock</b> <b>in</b> The Borrowers (1997) and he portrayed Louis T. Leonowens in Anna and the King (1999). He rose to prominence for his role as Draco Malfoy in the film adaptions of the best-selling Harry Potter fantasy novels by J.K. Rowling.

5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback. Texas' offense thus began its drive at its 20-yard line. The first play of the drive was an end-around that gained 10yards and a first down for Texas. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Mitchell gained five yards on a counter run. On third down, Williams caught a six-yard pass for a first down at the Texas 41-yard line. Mitchell ran six yards on first down, but was stopped after a gain of just one yard on second down. The second-down play caused the final seconds to tick off the <b>clock</b> <b>in</b> the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 1410.|$|E
