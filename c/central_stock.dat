5|$|The California {{sea lion}} ranges {{along the western}} coast and islands of North America, from {{southeast}} Alaska to central Mexico. Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California sea lion populations: the U.S. or Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The U.S. stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The above-mentioned stocks are separated by the Ensenada Front. The stocks of the Gulf of California live in the shallow waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (<b>Central</b> <b>stock),</b> and {{the mouth of the}} bay (Southern stock). The stock status of the sea lions at the deep waters of the central bay has not been analyzed.|$|E

Agreement on key issues was quickly reached. The Central would sell its twenty percent interest in the Baltimore and Ohio. The Pennsy would divest itself, over time, of its one-third interest in the Norfolk and Western. (Penn Central's financial officer, David C. Bevan, would use the $300 million realized from this sale on non-rail diversification.) The Central would thus {{go out of business}} as a corporate entity, while the corporate existence of the Pennsylvania would continue under a new name. By 1962 the Pennsy and Central boards approved a Penn Central merger where one share of Pennsy stock would be exchanged for one share of the new company's stock, and 1.3 shares of <b>Central</b> <b>stock</b> would be exchanged for one share of the new Penn <b>Central</b> <b>stock.</b> Board representation would be based on shares outstanding in 1961—about 6.5 million for the Central, about 13.2 for the Pennsy—the outstanding shares, resulted in a sixty-forty split on the new board in favor of the Pennsy shareholders.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – In most {{countries}} the distribution system for new cars has remained unchanged for many years, {{with the main}} emphasis on supplying customers from stock held at dealers. Despite high stocks, {{the performance of the}} supply chain has failed to meet customer expectations in terms of delivering the exact specification desired within an acceptable timescale. This paper investigates changes to the design of the supply chain which potentially offer significant improvements in performance. Design/methodology/approach – A simulation of the supply of new cars, from ordering through the assembly plant and finished vehicle stocking to customer delivery, has been used to develop further understanding of the dynamic performance of the supply chain. The application of the simulation model is demonstrated through scenarios drawn from research into the UK car market. Findings – The findings demonstrate the benefits of <b>central</b> <b>stocking</b> (storing new cars in distribution centres, rather than at dealers) for both manufactures and customers, supported by recent industry data. Research limitations/implications – The results presented are based on a representative vehicle model manufactured and sold in the UK; a range of alternative scenarios and changes to the supply chain design can be investigated using the simulation model. Practical implications – For the automotive industry, the research supports the introduction of <b>central</b> <b>stocking,</b> and demonstrates a methodology for assessing future changes to the supply chain. Originality/value – The research extends the range of applications of simulation to investigating supply chain design, and demonstrates the feasibility of this approach in modelling complex supply chains...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a reorder policy for a two-echelon supply chain with one <b>central</b> <b>stock</b> and multiple stores. The products under concern are high value imported watches, which exhibit high intermittent demand on the points of sale. The manager has centralized stock information over the entire chain and each store employs a base stock ordering policy. In spite of the lumpy demand on the stores, the monthly aggregate demand on the supply chain is significant and so, can be modeled using the continuous normal distribution approximation. The proposed model consists of an exponential smoothing forecasting model for the aggregate demand, a simple disaggregating method to derive the single items forecasts and a periodic reorder procedure. The order quantities of each item are determined according to the Poisson distribution and a desired service level. The purchased items are kept in the <b>central</b> <b>stock</b> and are shipped to stores on demand. The results achieved so far are very encouraging and should be extended to a wider range of brands and products...|$|E
40|$|Background: High {{level of}} {{workload}} {{has been identified}} among stressors of nurses in intensive care units (ICUs). The present study investigated nursing workload and identified its influencing perfor­mance obstacles in ICUs. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted, in 2013, on 81 nurses working in ICUs in Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran, Iran. NASA-TLX was applied for assessment of workload. Moreover, ICUs Performance Obstacles Questionnaire was used to identify performance obstacles associated with ICU nursing. Results: Physical demand (mean= 84. 17) was perceived {{as the most important}} dimensions of workload by nurses. The most critical performance obstacles affecting workload included: difficulty in finding a place to sit down, hectic workplace, disorganized workplace, poor-conditioned equipment, waiting for using a piece of equipment, spending much time seeking for supplies in the <b>central</b> <b>stock,</b> poor quality of medical materials, delay in getting medications, unpredicted problems, disorganized <b>central</b> <b>stock,</b> outpatient surgery, spending much time dealing with family needs, late, inadequate, and useless help from nurse assistants, and ineffective morning rounds (P-value< 0. 05).
