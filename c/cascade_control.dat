40|$|The survey from US Department of Energy {{showed that}} {{about one-third of}} energy {{consumption}} in US is due to air conditioning and refrigeration systems. This significant usage of electricity in the HVAC industry has prompted researchers to develop dynamic models for the HVAC components, which leads to implementation of better control and optimization techniques. In this research, efforts are made to model a multi-evaporator system. A novel dynamic modeling technique is proposed based on moving boundary method, which can be generalized {{for any number of}} evaporators in a vapor compression cycle. The models were validated experimentally on a commercial supermarket refrigeration unit. Simulation results showed that the models capture the major dynamics of the system in both the steady state and transient external disturbances. Furthermore the use of MEMS (microelectromechanical) based Silicon Expansion Valves (SEVs) have reportedly shown power savings as compared to the Thermal Expansion Valves (TEVs). Experimental tests were conducted on a supermarket refrigeration unit fitted with the MEMS valves to explain the cause of these potential energy savings. In this study an advanced <b>cascaded</b> <b>control</b> algorithm was also designed to control the MEMS valves. The performance of the <b>cascaded</b> <b>control</b> architecture was compared with the standard Thermal Expansion Valves (TEVs) and a commercially available Microstaq (MS) Superheat Controller (SHC). The results reveal that the significant efficiency gains derived on the SEVs are due to better superheat regulation, tighter superheat control and superior cooling effects in shorter time period which reduces the total run-time of the compressor. It was also observed that the duty cycle was least for the <b>cascaded</b> <b>control</b> algorithm. The reduction in duty cycle indicates early shut-off for the compressor resulting in maximum power savings for the <b>cascaded</b> <b>control,</b> followed by the Microstaq controller and then the Thermal Expansion Valves...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In the {{centralized}} heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, {{air handling}} units (AHUs) are traditionally controlled by single-loop proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. The control structure is simple, but the performance is usually not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a <b>cascade</b> <b>control</b> strategy for temperature control of AHU. Instead of a fixed PID controller in the classical <b>cascade</b> <b>control</b> scheme, a neural network (NN) controller {{is used in the}} outer control loop. This approach not only overcomes the tedious tuning procedure for the inner and outer loop PID parameters of a classical <b>cascade</b> <b>control</b> system, but also makes the whole control system be adaptive and robust. The multilayer NN is trained online by a special training algorithm—simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) -based training algorithm. With the SPSA-based training algorithm, the weight convergence of the NN and stability of the control system is guaranteed.
