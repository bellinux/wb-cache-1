5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The <b>caller</b> {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The <b>caller</b> then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the <b>caller,</b> the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The <b>caller</b> never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Until recently, in-language {{telephone}} quitline {{services for}} smokers who speak Asian languages were {{available only in}} California. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded the national Asian Smokers' Quitline (ASQ) to expand this service to all states. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine characteristics of ASQ <b>callers,</b> how they heard about the quitline, and their use of the service. Methods: Characteristics of <b>callers</b> from August 2012 through July 2014 were examined by using descriptive statistics. We examined demographics, cigarette smoking status, time to first cigarette, how <b>callers</b> heard about the quitline, and service use (receipt of counseling and medication) by using ASQ intake and administrative data. We analyzed these data by language and state. Results: In 2 years, 5, 771 <b>callers</b> from 48 states completed intake; 31 % were Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin), 38 % were Korean, and 31 % were Vietnamese. More than 95 % of all <b>callers</b> who used tobacco were current daily cigarette smokers at intake. About 87 % of ASQ <b>callers</b> were male, 57 % were aged 45 to 64 years, 48 % were uninsured, and educational attainment varied. Most <b>callers</b> (54 %) were referred by newspapers or magazines. Nearly all eligible <b>callers</b> (99 %) received nicotine patches. About 85 % of smokers enrolled in counseling; counseled smokers completed an average of 4 sessions. Conclusion: ASQ reached Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese speakers nationwide. <b>Callers</b> were referred by the promotional avenues employed by ASQ, and most received services (medication, counseling, or both). State quitlines and local organizations should consider transferring <b>callers</b> and promoting ASQ to increase access to cessation services...|$|R

40|$|Many people {{claim to}} have known who was calling before they picked up the telephone, or to have thought about someone for no {{apparent}} reason, who then called. We carried {{out a series of}} experiments to test whether or not people really could tell who was telephoning. Each participant had four potential <b>callers,</b> and when the telephone rang had to guess who was calling before the other person spoke. By chance the success rate would have been 25 %. In a total of 571 trials, involving 63 participants, the overall success rate was 40 %, with 95 % confidence limits from 36 to 45 %. This effect was hugely significant statistically (p = 4 x 10 - 16). We obtained similar positive effects when the calls were made at randomly chosen times, and when the calls were made at fixed times known to the subject in advance. With 37 participants, we compared the success rates with familiar and unfamiliar <b>callers</b> and found a striking difference. With familiar <b>callers,</b> 53 % of the guesses were correct (n = 190; p = 1 x 10 - 16). With unfamiliar <b>callers,</b> only 25 % of the guesses were correct, exactly at the chance level. This difference between the responses with familiar and unfamiliar <b>callers</b> was highly significant (p = 3 x 10 - 7). We also investigated the effects of distance between the <b>callers</b> and participants. With overseas <b>callers</b> at least 1, 000 miles away, the success rate was 65 % (n = 43; p = 3 x 10 - 8). With <b>callers</b> in Britain, the success rate was lower (35 %). In most cases, the overseas <b>callers</b> were people to whom the participants were closely bonded. For the successful identification of <b>callers,</b> emotional closeness seemed to be more important than physical proximity...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Psychosocial {{crisis and}} {{psychiatric}} disorders are two stressors for suicide action. This {{study will explore}} the differences on demographic characteristics, severity of depression, and suicidality of middle-aged and elder crisis line <b>callers</b> under the influences of psychosocial crisis or psychiatric disorders or two simultaneously-mixed stressors, {{in order to develop}} effective intervention strategies for crisis line. Methods: Analysis data of 1, 092 cases selected from national crisis line <b>callers</b> aged 45 and over who were assessed with “Suicide risk assessment” during the period from December, 2002 to December, 2008. The sample were divided into three groups of psychosocial crisis, mental health problems, and mixed-stressors of three types of general <b>callers</b> (48. 2 %, 32. 3 %, 19. 5 %), <b>callers</b> with current suicide ideation (43. 7 %, 33. 0 %, 23. 3 %) and <b>callers</b> attempted suicide 2 weeks prior to the call (33. 6 %, 42. 3 %, 24. 1 %) respectively according to the operators’ judgments of the callers’ claimed difficult situations and classification system of crisis line database. X 2 test and Tukey-type and Multinomial Logistic Regression multiple comparison methods are applied to analysis the differences of the three groups. Results: In agreement with previous studies, more females (71. 3 %, X 2 = 13. 45, P< 0. 001), especially females influenced by relationship stressors (76. 8 %, X 2 = 25. 12, P< 0. 001) made the call for crisis. Among general <b>callers,</b> the check-out rates of Major Depression Episode of mixed-stressor <b>callers</b> (78. 5 %, P< 0. 001) and problem <b>callers</b> (68. 7 %, P< 0. 05) were significantly higher than that of crisis <b>callers</b> (57. 1 %). The check-out rates of suicide ideation of mixed-stressor <b>callers</b> (71. 4 %) were significantly higher than that in crisis <b>callers</b> (53. 8 %, P< 0. 001) and problem <b>callers</b> (60. 9 %, P< 0. 05). The check-out rates of prior suicide attempts of mixed-stressor (16. 6 %, P< 0. 05) and problem <b>callers</b> (18. 5 %, P< 0. 01) were significantly higher than that of crisis <b>callers</b> (9. 8 %). More than half of the mixed-stressor <b>callers</b> (51. 8 %) reported over 50 % degree of hopelessness, which was significantly higher than that of crisis <b>callers</b> (35. 6 %, P< 0. 01) and problem <b>callers</b> (38. 2 %, P< 0. 05). Fewer crisis <b>callers</b> sought medical help than problem and mixed-stressor <b>callers</b> among three types of <b>callers</b> (X 2 = 241. 35, 146. 56, 50. 87; P< 0. 001). Compare to non-compound crisis <b>callers,</b> the proportion of minor, severe depression and prior depression diagnosis (14. 0 % vs. 17. 4 %; 54. 9 % vs. 65. 2 %; 0 vs. 2. 2 %; X 2 = 14. 35 ，P< 0. 01), suicide ideation (51. 1 % vs. 64. 0 %, P< 0. 05) and prior suicide attempts (8. 4 % vs. 15. 0 %, P< 0. 05) in compound crisis <b>callers</b> were significantly higher. There were more compound crisis <b>callers</b> with over 50 % hopelessness (51. 9 % vs. 31. 0 %，X 2 = 11. 96 ，P< 0. 01). Conclusion: As predicted, among middle-aged and elderly participants, mixed-stressor and compound crisis <b>callers</b> were higher in degree of severity of depression and suicidality. Intervention strategies should be developed addressing to specific stressor or stressors. The promotions of crisis callers’ medical help seeking behavior need to be emphasized. 目的: 心理社会危机与精神障碍是导致自杀行为的两大应激源。本文探讨遭遇心理社会危机或精神障碍，或同时遭遇两者情况下，中老年危机热线来电者在个体人口学特征、抑郁程度、自杀危险和应激复合性上的差异，以利制定有效干预策略。 方法: 二次分析全国危机热线自 2002 年 12 月至 2008 年 12 月使用《北京心理危机研究与干预中心热线自杀危险评估（本人版）》收集的 1, 092 名 45 岁及以上中老年来电者的数据资料。根据数据库分类系统对来电者属心理社会危机、精神心理问题或混合的判别，分组比较总体来电者（ 48. 2 %, 32. 3 %, 19. 5 %）、自杀意念者（ 43. 7 %, 33. 0 %, 23. 3 %）和 2 周前自杀未遂者（ 33. 6 %, 42. 3 %, 24. 1 %）三类人群；分组比较关系或非关系性危机、单一或叠加应激源。使用X 2 检验和Tukey-type与Multinomial Logistic Regression等统计方法。 结果: 与既往研究结果一致，女性（ 71. 3 %, X 2 = 13. 45, P< 0. 001 ），特别是遭遇关系性危机的女性（ 76. 8 %, X 2 = 25. 12, P< 0. 001 ）更可能因心理社会危机求助热线。总体来电者中，混合组（ 78. 5 %, P< 0. 001 ）和问题组（ 68. 7 %, P< 0. 05 ）重性抑郁发作检出率显著高于危机组（ 57. 1 %）；混合组自杀意念检出率（ 71. 4 %）显著高于危机组（ 53. 8 %, P< 0. 001 ）和问题组（ 60. 9 %, P< 0. 05 ）；混合组（ 16. 6 %, P< 0. 05 ）和问题组（ 18. 5 %, P< 0. 01 ） 2 周前自杀未遂检出率显著高于危机组（ 9. 8 %）；混合组超过一半来电者（ 51. 8 %）绝望程度在 50 %以上，显著高于危机组的 35. 6 %（P< 0. 01 ）和问题者组的 38. 2 %（P< 0. 05 ）。三类人群中危机者未求医比例均显著高于另两组（X 2 = 241. 35, 146. 56, 50. 87; P < 0. 001 ）。与单一危机组相比，叠加危机组的轻、重度抑郁和既往抑郁诊断比例（ 14. 0 % vs. 17. 4 %; 54. 9 % vs. 65. 2 %; 0 vs. 2. 2 %; X 2 = 14. 35 ，P< 0. 01 ），以及自杀意念（ 51. 1 % vs. 64. 0 %, P < 0. 05 ）和 2 周前自杀未遂检出率（ 8. 4 % vs. 15. 0 %, P < 0. 05 ）也显著高于单一危机组。有更多叠加危机者绝望程度在 50 %以上（ 51. 9 % vs. 31. 0 %，X 2 = 11. 96 ，P< 0. 01 ）。 结论: 与研究假设一致，同时遭遇两类应激源和遭遇叠加危机的中老年来电者，抑郁程度和自杀危险更高。应针对应激源制定干预策略，并重点促进危机者的求医行为...|$|R
