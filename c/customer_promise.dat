Supply chain systems are designed to add value and reduce cost in the process of moving goods from design concept to retail stores and finally through to consumption. Efficient supply chains are critical to delivering the retail <b>customer</b> <b>promise</b> of fast fashion. The selection of a merchandising vendor is a key part in the process. Inefficiency primarily occurs when suppliers can't respond quickly enough, and clothing ends up bottlenecked and in back stock. [...] Two kinds of supply chains exist, agile and lean. In an agile supply chain the principal characteristics include the sharing of information and technology. [...] The collaboration results in the reduction in the amount of stock in the megastores. A lean supply chain is characterized as the correct appropriation of the commodity for the product. [...] The combination of the two supply chains is called [...] "leagile".|$|E

40|$|Today’s {{business}} world {{is characterized by}} an increased demand for innovation, shorter product life cycles, and incredible pressures to launch new products quickly. At the same time, product development teams face cost-cutting challenges. Even {{in the face of}} these pressures, no business can afford to sacrifice robust design. To fulfill the ultimate <b>customer</b> <b>promise,</b> products must perform as expected in the real world, every day and in every situation. Engineering simulation, with its ability to design, prototype and test products in the low-risk virtual world, has provided many companies with a fast, cost-effective way to create robust product designs [1]. However, not every company is leveraging the full power of engineering simulation tools. These advanced solutions have an incredible capa-bility to support parametric analyses — in which certain design parameters are modified and the effect of these variations is studied across the entire design in an iterative process. By understanding the impact of each small change, the speed of the product development process can be increased by a factor of 10. Why aren’t more companies embracing the speed and power of this advanced analysis? Engineering teams may claim they lack the time, com-putational power or advanced software tools needed to create the neces-sary design environment. Whatever the excuse, one clear fact is emerging: As business pressures continue to increase, parametric design studies are becoming a competitive imperative. Those businesses that adopt this concept will be leaders, while others will be followers. Getting It Right the First Time Jim Cashman, CEO of ANSYS, recently noted, “The cost of being wrong has never been so great. ” Throughout 2010 and 2011, global headlines were dominated by product failures and recalls that not only cost billions of dollars — but also caused irreparable damage to some well-known con-sumer brand names. Even if your product integrity issues don’t make worldwide news, they still increase warranty costs and impact customer confidence. Quality, reliability and robust design are critical to fulfilling your essential promises to customers...|$|E
40|$|Every modern {{company has}} to deal with some kind of forecasting. Whether it is capacity, demand, cash flow or some other kind of forecasting, there is always one common factor: {{uncertainty}}. This uncertainty has to be quantified in order to plan the optimal way of conducting future business. The objective {{of this study is to}} research a case analysis of a capacity planning problem. The analyzed problem is a logistical capacity problem resembling newsvendor problem, where both overstocking and understocking carries an extra cost. A third party logistical company has to forecast the optimal amount of delivery trucks to hire for the next week based only on delivery data from previous deliveries. They have made a <b>customer</b> <b>promise</b> to deliver the packages on the promised date or they will be delivered for free during the next date. If they rent too few vehicles, they cannot make the deliveries on the promised date, but if they hire too many they will pay for half-empty cars for nothing. The aim of this study is to solve the optimal amount of ordered trucks for each week and to investigate if they newsvendor model is actually a suitable model for solving such problem. Methodology of the study is to first review the scientific literature of the newsvendor model and it's applications. To object is to recognize how the model should be used to evaluate the problem at hand and which factors should be used to review the outcome. After the literature review is completed, the outcome of the constructed model is reviewed under the recognized criteria. The recognized important parameters are the delivery fleet size, net profit, delivery rate and expected utility. Each potentially optimal solution is reviewed under these terms and then compared to other options as a whole. After this, the findings are reflected and discussed. The main finding of this study is that the solution provided by newsvendor model was well in line with recognized real life evaluation criteria, which would suggest that newsvendor model is a suitable model for solving such problems. The suggested optimal solution was found to be a very good solution in terms of each individual review criteria, but it was also the optimal solution when taking all review parameters in the account. These findings are reflected with limitations of the study before providing future research suggestions and conclusion...|$|E

In the deed contains {{the power of the}} debtor to the Bank to sell the collateral if the debtor's default. Authorization To Sell clause is contrary to the provisions contained in Law Number 4 Year 1996 about Mortgage. Under the provisions of Article 20 paragraph (4) UUHT which reads "Any promise to execute the Mortgage is in a way contrary to the provisions of paragraph (1), subsection (2) and paragraph (3) null and void", then the clause Authorization To Sell it becomes null and void. Based on the description above, the problem that arises is whether the deed of Promissory Notes and Credit Authorization To Sell on Home Ownership in Malang BTN Syariah Branches can be used {{as the basis for the}} execution of object security? Then how processes in the implementation of deed of Promissory Notes and Authorization To Sell cidero if <b>customer</b> <b>promise.</b> In this thesis, the methods used method of empirical legal research using sociological juridical approach. The results of the above problems arising deed reveals that the status of Promissory Notes and Authorization To Sell on BTN in mortgage in Malang branch is as evidence in court if the dispute arises in future for lending under 50 million and as evidence in complementary and reinforcing declaration form and approval by customers to the bank stating the bank could sell under his hand for lending over 50 million. This deed can not be used as the basis for binding of the collateral for collateral such as land and buildings can only be tied with dependents and rights set forth in the Deed of mortgage (APHT) and in practice, BTN Syariah SKMHT to APHT not increase to above 50 million loan financing. Parties BTN Syariah SKMHT become APHT to improve credit financing more than 50 million, when the debtor shows symptoms of bad credit. Then the factors that inhibit the use of debt and Deed of Recognition Authorization To Sell as a tool for executing collateral when debtors default is BTN officials prefer to use Mortgage execution through the sale in public; the debtor is not willing, if the collateral sold directly by the BTN without going through auction mechanism, and assume that the notarial deed can not be directly used by the BTN to sell the collateral when the debtor is in default due to collateral is also burdened with the Mortgage. While the role of notaries in connection with the manufacture of debt and Deed of Recognition of the power to sell is very important, namely Notary must provide advice related to the provision that prohibits the execution UUHT mortgage in a way beyond the provisions of Article 20 paragraph (1), subsection (2) and paragraph (3) and liabilities increased SKMHT become APHT to exceed 50 million mortgage financing in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 paragraph UUHT (30, subsection (4) and paragraph 95).

Nowadays, there are billions of user comments available discussing all aspects of life and the data source is still growing. This thesis investigates, whether it is possible to use this growing amount of freely provided user comments to extract quality related information.
