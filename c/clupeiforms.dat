50|$|In {{coastal waters}} along the North American eastern seaboard, little tunny are carnivorous, and {{primarily}} feed on small fish and invertebrates {{that occur in}} schools. Its diet consists mostly of fish; it particularly likes the Atlantic bigeye and largehead hairtail. Second to fish, the little tunny consumes crustaceans, and lastly cephalopods and gastropods make up {{a small part of}} its diet. Sardines, scad, and anchovies are common in the diet along with squid, stomatopods, and organisms from the Diogenidae family. The diet of the fish is also relative to its size. A smaller fish's diet typically consists of <b>clupeiforms,</b> and larvae, while the larger fish mostly eat Maurolicus muelleri. The typical diet is very {{similar to that of the}} king mackerel because the fish are of a similar size and live in the same area of the water column. It mostly feeds on pelagic fish. The little tunny is an opportunistic predator, feeding on crustaceans, clupeid fishes, squids, and tunicates. Its diet also responds to seasonal changes in food availability. It has nocturnal feeding habits, and is a specialist feeder. It often feeds on herring and sardines in inshore waters near the surface of the water. The little tunny commonly feeds in large schools because their primary food sources (small fish and the larval forms of crustaceans) are typically in schools, as well.|$|E
40|$|The {{current trends}} in {{molecular}} phylogenetics are towards assembling large data matrices from many independent loci and employing realistic probabilistic models. Large genome-scale data sets shall reduce the sampling error, whereas complex models accommodating heterogeneity among sites {{and along the}} phylogenetic tree can decrease systematic errors. The theme of this dissertation project is using both bioinformatic and experimental approaches to develop genome-scale nuclear gene markers and applying them in studies of phylogeny of ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) and systematics of <b>clupeiforms.</b> Bioinformatic tools and computer programs were developed to search for conserved single-copy nuclear genes with long exons. By comparing within and between genomes of zebrafish and pufferfish, I have found 138 candidate markers. Ten of fifteen candidates tested were found as good phylogenetic markers, showing similar performance as the popular nuclear marker, recombination activating gene 1 (RAG 1). Using the ten newly developed nuclear markers, I conducted a phylogenetic analysis on 52 taxa representing 41 of 44 ray-finned fish orders along with four tetrapods as outgroups. The effects of different data partitioning methods were also tested. Some classic hypotheses about phylogenetic interrelationships of ray-finned fish based on morphological characters were rediscovered in this study, such as the “Holostei” group. In the last two chapters, I present the results of phylogenetic analyses of <b>clupeiforms</b> based on mitochondrial 12 S and 16 S ribosomal RNA genes, RAG 1, RAG 2 and six new nuclear loci. <b>Clupeiforms</b> include herrings, anchovies, etc. They have worldwide distribution and important commercial values. The most significant result of the study on <b>clupeiforms</b> is that Clupeidae is not monophyletic. Finally, the last chapter showed that adding sequences from the six new loci significantly improved the resolution and suggested a different relationship at the basal clupeiods. ...|$|E
40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown {{that at least one}} species of fish ~the American shad! in the order <b>clupeiforms</b> ~herrings, shads, and relatives! is able to detect sounds up to 180 kHz. However, it has not been clear whether other members of this order are also able to detect ultrasound. It is now demonstrated, using auditory brainstem response ~ABR!, that at least one additional species, the gulf menhaden ~Brevoortia patronus!, is able to detect ultrasound, while several other species including the bay anchovy ~Anchoa mitchilli!, scaled sardine ~Harengula jaguana!, and Spanish sardine ~Sardinella aurita! only detect sounds to about 4 kHz. ABR is used to confirm ultrasonic hearing in the American shad. The results suggest that ultrasound detection may be limited to one subfamily of <b>clupeiforms,</b> the Alosinae. It is suggested that ultrasound detection involves the utricle of the inner ear and speculate as to why, despite having similar ear structures, only one group may detect ultrasound...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In {{order to}} {{understand}} the morphological differences between four populations of genus Coilia (Teleostei: <b>Clupeiforms)</b> and identify them conveniently, truss network data were used to conduct multivariate analysis. Nine-teen morphometric measurements were made for each individual. Burnaby’s multivariate method was used to obtain size-adjusted shape data. The cluster analysis and discriminant analysis were used to discriminate among popula-tions. The results indicated that 1) the four populations were clustered into three distinct groups; the first group in-cluded Changjiang C. mystus and Taihu C. ectenes, the second one included Zhujiang C. mystus, the last one included Changjiang C. ectenes, and 2) discriminant analysis with selected 4 morphological parameters showed that the iden-tification accuracy was between 88 % and 100 %, and global identification accuracy was 95 %. Our result showed that populations of different Coilia species living in geographic proximity to one another are more similar than conspecifics living farther apart. Separation and adaption are important to morphological difference. The taxonomy of genus Coilia should be reconsidered.

40|$|Abstract. —A cross-shelf {{transect}} {{of three}} {{oil and gas}} platforms in the north-central Gulf was sampled to examine the role that platforms (hard substrate habitat) may play in the early life history stages of reef-dependent and reef-associated fishes. The ichthyoplankton and juvenile fish assemblages were sampled at Green Canyon 18 (219 -m depth, shelf slope), Grand Isle 94 (60 -m depth, mid-shelf), and South Timbalier 54 (22 -m depth, inner shelf) with passive plankton nets and light traps. At all sites, <b>clupeiforms</b> were the dominant taxa collected, comprising 59 – 97 % of the total catch. Reef-dependent fishes (e. g., pomacentrids and scarids) were relatively rare at all platforms, while reef-associated taxa (e. g., serranids, carangids, and blenniids) were generally more common. High numbers of piscivorous juveniles (synodontids, scombrids, and carangids) were collected, indicating that predation during early life history stages may be important in determining local reef assemblages. Similarity indices indicated that the larval and juvenile fish assemblages collected at the platforms differed across the shelf. Overall, across-shelf patterns in reef fish larval and juvenile fish distributions {{were similar to those}} of the adults. Taxonomic richness (genus level) was highest at the mid-shelf platform, possibly a result of its proximity to a high density of upstream and surrounding platforms...|$|E

Two {{species of the}} genus Pellona, P. castelnaeana Valenciennes, 1847 and P. flavipinnis (Valenciennes, 1837), inhabit fresh waters of the neotropical region, with the latter occurring in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso, in the Paraguay River basin of central Brazil. The development of P. flavipinnis larvae and early juveniles was characterized from an ontogenic series of 27 specimens (6. 3 – 35 mm SL), based on morphological and meristic characters. The larval and juvenile development of this freshwater sardine are typical of most <b>clupeiforms.</b> Exact hatching size is unknown, but it is less than 6 mm standard length (SL) and the yolk is absorbed under 10 mm.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{north-eastern}} Atlantic, meagre (Argyrosmus regius) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} fish living on the shelf and this species has important commercial interest. Over the past two decades, large variations in meagre abundance have been observed with pluri-annual cycles but the factors involved in such variations are still unclear. Trophic interactions between meagre and other species (both prey and competitors) might be one explanatory variable of the observed variations in meagre recruitment and abundance. In the present study, we described the diet of commercial-size meagre in the Bay of Biscay from stomach content and stable isotope analyses, and explored its dietary ontogeny. We found that commercial-size meagres were mostly piscivorous with a diet dominated by <b>clupeiform</b> fish (mainly anchovy and sardine) completed by demersal fish (mainly pout and whiting). Cannibalism also accounted for a non-negligible part of the diet. Interestingly, stable isotope and stomach content analyses showed only a very slight increase in prey length and trophic level during the ontogeny of large meagre after 50 cm of total length and despite a 3 fold-change of the individual length in our sampling. Our results suggested that specific trophic interactions (i. e., bottom-up control by <b>clupeiform</b> fish on meagre population, competitive effects on piscivorous populations or top-down control by meagre on <b>clupeiform</b> fish populations) may occur in the Bay of Biscay and can impact meagre abundance dynamics.

40|$|Abstract This study {{investigated}} the impact of anthropogenic activities in Belém City, Brazilian Amazon, by comparing water quality and fish larvae communities in two creeks that flow into the Guamá River. One creek crossed a poor and crowded suburb of Belém while the other was located in an island section that was declared an Environmental Protected Area in 1997. Two sampling points were set in each creek and monitored over eight hours once every three months over a one-year period. Strong variations of water quality were registered all year long and at all tides in Belém's mainland creek, along with, among other things, a very high number of thermotolerant coliforms. Few larvae were found. The water was considered unsuitable for human use and activities {{as well as for}} aquatic life. The island creek presented early signs of bacterial and nutrient contaminations during the rainy season, probably partly related to non-point source pollution. In both creeks, larvae communities were almost exclusively composed of <b>clupeiforms.</b> All larval development stages were encountered.

40|$|Measuring fish target {{strength}} (TS) in {{the wild}} is challenging because: (i) TS varies versus physical (orientation relative to the incident sound wave, size, and depth) and physiological fish attributes (maturity and condition), (ii) the target species and its aforementioned attributes are difficult to assess in near real time, and (iii) {{in the case of}} packed fish schools, accepted echoes may originate from multiple unresolved targets. We propose a method for controlled TS measurements of densely packed small pelagic fish during daytime, based on the joint use of a Remotely Operated Towed Vehicle, “EROC”, with a pelagic trawl fitted with a codend opening system, “ENROL”. EROC, equipped with a 70 -kHz split-beam echosounder (Simrad EK 60) and a low-light black and white camera, can be moved inside the fishing trawl. Pelagic fish are funnelled into the open trawl and their TS is measured {{in the middle of the}} net, where small groups actively swim towards the trawl mouth. The swimming behaviour allows for near-dorsal TS to be measured, minimizing the large effect of incidence angle on TS variability. The EROC camera, located near the open codend, provides optical identification of the species. This method was used to measure the TS of European Anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus in the Bay of Biscay during 2014. The mean, near dorsal TS was − 43. 3 [*]dB, for a mean fork length of 12. 5 [*]cm.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that a few fish species, including American shad (Alosa sapidissima; Clupeiformes), are able to detect sound up to 180 kHz, an ability not found in most other fishes. Initially, it was proposed that ultrasound detection in shad involves the auditory bullae, swim bladder extensions found in {{all members of the}} Clupeiformes. However, while all clupeiformes have bullae, not all can detect ultrasound. Thus, the bullae alone are not sufficient to explain ultrasound detection. In this study, we used a developmental approach to determine when ultrasound detection begins and how the ability to detect ultrasound changes with ontogeny in American shad. We then compared changes in auditory function with morphological development to identify structures that are potentially responsible for ultrasound detection. We found that the auditory bullae and all three auditory end organs are present well before fish show ultrasound detection behaviourally and we suggest that an additional specialization in the utricle (one of the auditory end organs) forms coincident with the onset of ultrasound detection. We further show that this utricular specialization is found in two <b>clupeiform</b> species that can detect ultrasound but not in two <b>clupeiform</b> species not capable of ultrasound detection. Thus, it appears that ultrasound-detecting clupeiformes have undergone structural modification of the utricle that allows detection of ultrasonic stimulation...|$|R

The levels of mercury were significantly lower in epipelagic (<b>Clupeiforms)</b> than in demersal fish. When representation of each species in the discards is taken into account, the mean mercury concentration from this resource is more than double that of epipelagic fish (the main natural prey for most seabirds in the area). The shag was the only species with direct access to benthic fish, as it can dive to the seabed, and shags presented high levels of mercury even though they do not feed on discards, The other seabirds showed mercury levels in accordance with their seasonal use of discards. Audouin's gull, which exploits discards extensively during the breeding season, had the highest levels in those tissues reflecting mercury intake during the breeding season (liver and 1 st primary feathers). In contrast, the common tern makes little use of discards and presented the lowest levels of mercury. For those samples reflecting the intake of mercury during the winter (mantle feathers), when only the yellow-legged gull exploits discards extensively, this species presented the highest values. Audouin's gull and the common tern showed similarly low concentrations of mercury for this period. We conclude that consumption of discarded demersal fish strongly influenced mercury contamination of surface-feeding seabirds...|$|E

40|$|The {{result of}} seven years of {{research}} on Late Cretaceous Osteichthyan fishes from the northeastern Mexican states Coahuila and Nuevo León is presented here. The fossil record of the area yielded single species of Coelacanthiforms, Pycnodontiforms, Aspidorhynchids, Elopiforms, Crossognathids, <b>Clupeiforms</b> and Beryciforms. Additionally two tselfatiiform species and two aulopiform species were recognized. Furthermore three Pachyrhizodontids and four Ichthyodectiforms were described. Nine species were recognized {{for the first time}} in the area. Seven of them were hitherto unknown in the Western hemisphere. Four species were erected. The combined assemblage consisting of 18 taxa came from six localities and is distributed into four different stratigraphic stages ranging from the middle Cenomanian to the middle Santonian. A compilation of the “mid”-Cretaceous actinopterygian record of Mexico integrates 65 genera from ten localities, distributed within six time slices from the Albian to the Middle Santonian. A significant faunal turnover is evidenced by taxonomical changes during the Albian and Cenomanian, followed by an interval of taxonomic stability during the Latest Cenomanian up to the Santonian. This evolutionary pattern parallels a similar pattern of environmental factors such as sea surface temperature and sea level. During the Albian the Mexican fish assemblages are palaeobiogeographically related with western Gondwana localities, but these similarities decline during the Cenomanian. A Central and Eastern Tethyan influence on Mexican fish assemblages increases during this stage and culminates during the early Turonian in similar species on both sides of the early Proto-Atlantic and Tethys. The Coniacian and Santonian localities of Mexico share the majority of genera with the Western Interior Seaway forming a distinct actinopterygian “Southern Interior-Northern Gulfian” paleobiogeographical sub-province, which developed in the Turonian. These faunal changes coincide with an unchanging tectonic framework, which identifies oceanic dispersal as a driving mechanism for the changes of Mexican actinopterygian assemblages. Vicariance events in the Cenomanian were followed by regional extinction and subsequent strong westbound oceanic dispersal during the Early Turonian. Postulated dispersal routes coincide with ocean current models for this period of time. The composition of Mexican “Mid” Cretaceous actinopterygian assemblages was therefore affected by a mixture of dispersal, subsequent vicariance and extinction events, followed by faunal replacement probably due to subsequent dispersal. The velocity of faunal turnover is correlated to the frequency of environmental changes...|$|E
40|$|Instead of teeth, modern mysticetes bear hairfringed keratinous baleen plates {{that permit}} various bulkfiltering {{predation}} techniques (from subsurface skimming to lateral benthic suction and engulfment) devoted to various target prey (from small invertebrates to schooling fish).

Unfortunately, no fossil stomach contents of ancient mysticetes have been described so far; {{the investigation of the}} diet of fossil baleen whales, including the Neogene family Cetotheriidae, remains thus largely speculative. We report on an aggregate of fossil fish remains found within a mysticete skeleton belonging to an undescribed late Miocene (Tortonian) cetotheriid from the Pisco Formation (Peru). Micro-computed tomography allowed us to interpret it as the fossilized content of the forestomach of the host whale and to identify the prey as belonging to the extant <b>clupeiform</b> genus Sardinops. Our discovery represents the first direct evidence of piscivory in an ancient edentulous mysticete. Since among modern mysticetes only Balaenopteridae are known to ordinarily consume fish, this fossil record may indicate that part of the cetotheriids experimented some degree of balaenopteridlike engulfment feeding. Moreover, this report corresponds to one of the geologically oldest records of Sardinops worldwide, occurring near the Tortonian peak of oceanic primary productivity and cooling phase.

These species have been chosen because they represent two different morphotypes, 1) that of the <b>clupeiforms,</b> which correspond to a stylized larvae with small mouth, long body and digestive tract linked to the tail, and 2) that of bullet tuna and hake, which correspond to a robust larvae with big mouth, robust body and compact digestive tract independent of the tail. Moreover, we have studied the diet variations i) along development, in relation to ii) prey availability and iii) morphology of the feeding-related structures like visual system, mouth and digestive tract. Feeding is an important aspect of the larval fish ecology that affects the population dynamics (through larval survival and subsequence recruitment fluctuations). The factors that affect the larvae in their prey selection and the feeding strategies have been scarcely studied for these species in the Catalan Sea. These factors can be different depending on the species and can change with ontogeny. The main objective of this Ph. D has been to understand the specific trophic strategies of the larvae of these five important species in Mediterranean fisheries. We can point out three types of strategies: 1) The hake’s one, which from the onset specializes feeding in a prey type (Clausocalanus spp.) and only increases the number of copepods to respond to the nutritional requirements of growth. 2) Anchovy and sardine’s type, which show low feeding incidence at the beginning, and they change the size and number of preys step by step along development without showing abrupt changes in the diet. 3) Bullet tuna and hake’s type, opportunist species which deeply adjust their prey type (and size) in their larval period as they enhance their abilities [ [...] . ]Esta Tesis Doctoral ha sido realizada gracias a una beca/contrato predoctoral del Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (España) durante 4 años que se encuadra dentro del Programa de Formación de Personal Investigador (FPI) y ha comprendido un periodo de tiempo desde el 1 de Agosto de 2005 hasta el 30 de julio de 2009 Peer Reviewe...|$|E

Counts were made at 81 hydrographic sampling stations. The three most abundant species were those with the greatest breeding numbers in the area: Audouin's Gull (Larus audouinii), Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), and Balearic Shearwater (Puffinus yelkouan mauretanicus). All three species were found in both inshore and offshore waters, and up to around 200 km from their nearest colonies. The area with the highest concentration of individuals coincided for the three species, circa 40 km southeast of {{the mouth of the}} Ebro River, where high densities of <b>clupeiform</b> fishes occur. In contrast, the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus cachinnans), a species also having large breeding numbers in the area, was not common at sea, especially in offshore waters. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of digenean, Pseudobacciger cheneyae n. sp., is {{described}} from the intestines of Weber 2 ̆ 7 s chromis (Chromis weberi Fowler & Bean) from off Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia. This species differs from the three described species of Pseudobacciger Nahhas & Cable, 1964 [P. cablei Madhavi, 1975, P. harengulae Yamaguti, 1938 and P. manteri Nahhas & Cable, 1964] in combinations {{of the size of}} the suckers and the length of the caeca. The host of the present species is a perciform (Family Pomacentridae) which contrasts with previous records of the genus which are almost exclusively from <b>clupeiform</b> fishes. The genus Pseudobacciger is presently recognised within the family Faustulidae (Poche, 1926) but phylogenetic analyses of 28 S and ITS 2 rDNA show that the new species bears no relationship to species of four other faustulid genera (Antorchis Linton, 1911, Bacciger Nicoll, 1924, Paradiscogaster Yamaguti, 1934 and Trigonocryptus Martin, 1958) but that instead it is nested within the Gymnophalloidea (Odhner, 1905) as sister to the Tandanicolidae (Johnston, 1927). This result suggests that the Faustulidae is polyphyletic...|$|R
40|$|Many {{streams and}} large rivers present higher ichthyoplankton densities at night. However, in some rivers {{this does not}} occur and larvae are equally {{abundant}} during the day. Larval drift diel variation is an important information for planning sampling programs for evaluating larval distribution and production. The {{aim of this study}} was to test whether the abundance of larval fish was different at either period. We tested it by comparing day and night densities of characiform, <b>clupeiform</b> and siluriform larvae during five years in the Amazon and one year in Rio Negro. We found that larvae of three species of characiform and larvae of siluriform were equally abundant during day and night in the Amazon. Conversely, the catch of Pellona spp. larvae was significantly higher during the day. In Rio Negro, however, larval abundance was higher during the night. These results imply that day samplings estimate adequately the abundance of these characiform and siluriform larvae in the Amazon, but not Pellona larvae. Evaluations of larved densities of Rio Negro will have to consider night sampling...|$|R
40|$|The {{food and}} feeding habits of Sardinella longiceps, {{economically}} {{the most valuable}} <b>clupeiform</b> fish from Indian waters, had {{been the subject of}} study for the past five decades (Hornell, 1910; Homell and Nayudu, 1924; Devanesan, 1943; Chidarbaram, 1950; Nair, 1963; Nair and Subrahmanyan, 1955; Venkataraman, 1960; Dhulkhed, 1962). Although a general idea of the elements on which the oil sardine subsists is worked out, data published on the food-habits of the different stages in its life-span is scanty and doubtful. Chidambaram (1950) opines that the food of young and adult sardines does not differ much. Reference that "immature adults and spawners" feed "mostly on phytoplankton" and "very young sardines" feed mainly on copepods has been made by Nair (1953). Comprehensive study of the differences in the food and feeding habits has not been made by previous workers. Hence the present report on the differences observed in the food and feeding adaptations between juveniles and adults of S. longiceps while studying its biology at Cannanore (south-west coast of India) may be of interest...|$|R
40|$|Although modern {{beaked whales}} (Ziphiidae) {{are known to}} be highly {{specialized}} toothed whales that predominantly feed at great depths upon benthic and benthopelagic prey, only limited palaeontological data document this major ecological shift. We report on a ziphiid–fish assemblage from the Late Miocene of Peru that we interpret as the first direct evidence of a predator–prey relationship between a ziphiid and epipelagic fish. Preserved in a dolomite concretion, a skeleton of the stem ziphiid Messapicetus gregarius was discovered together with numerous skeletons of a <b>clupeiform</b> fish closely related to the epipelagic extant Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax). Based on the position of fish individuals along the head and chest regions of the ziphiid, the lack of digestion marks on fish remains and the homogeneous size of individuals, we propose that this assemblage results from the death of the whale (possibly via toxin poisoning) shortly after the capture of prey from a single school. Together with morphological data and the frequent discovery of fossil crown ziphiids in deep-sea deposits, this exceptional record supports the hypothesis that only more derived ziphiids were regular deep divers and that the extinction of epipelagic forms may coincide with the radiation of true dolphin...|$|R
