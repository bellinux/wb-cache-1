40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the evolutionary legal framework regarding the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>association</b> in participation. Recent legislative interventions redefine the limits of working performances which can be accomplished under such contract. First of all, the A. analyses the different rebuttable presumptions introduced by Law 92 / 2012 with a view to avoid abusive use of association in participation as a way to escape an ordinary employment contract. Further on, the A. examines the general limits to make use of such contract as a negotiating scheme capable of including work services. At the end of the analysis the A. infers that an excessive use of restrictive rules might inhibit also “genuine” contractual relationships, where no abusive intent can be detected, thus provoking distortions in the labour market. A new regulation, based on the figure of the economically dependent self-employed worker, is finally endorsed by the Author as a way both to avoid alteration of labour law principles and to provide benefits to the whole economic system...|$|E

Rarefied gas flow through a micro-orifice connecting two reservoirs at small pressure differences is considered in the whole range of rarefaction by the linearized BGK kinetic model equation. The problem is computationally challenging due to the five dimensional nature of the distribution function and techniques such as parallelization and numerical schemes of low memory requirements have been applied.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the defect distribution produced {{in the first few}} picoseconds of a collision cascade on long-term damage evolution is studied with molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) methods. Three different interatomic potentials are used to obtain the primary damage produced by energetic recoils in α-Fe. Contrary to previous results, a dependence of cluster-size distribution with recoil energy is obtained. Moreover, large variations in this distribution are observed depending on the interatomic potential. Using the results for 50 keV collision cascades, damage accumulation is modeled with KMC. The accumulation rate of damage visible under transmission electron microscopy predicted by KMC depends significantly on the database used for cascade damage and, therefore, on the interatomic potential. Based on these results, we show that the comparison of cluster-size distributions with experiments can be used to test the reliability of interatomic potentials.

The new Civil Code (2009), republished in 2011, in force since the 1 st October 2011, fundamented on the monist approach of regulation, as the common-law norm for all the domains that the letter and the spirit of its provisions refer to, regulates the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>association,</b> in chapter VII of the 5 thBook; apart from the general norms applicable to all such contracts of association, the present code replaces the former civil society without legal personality with the present simple society and, also as a novelty element, transposes the regulation of the silent partnership from the former framework of the Commercial Code (1887, abrogated almost in totality) in the section 3 of the same chapter VII, the 5 th Book of the code.

40|$|The article disscusses the {{question}} of representation <b>of</b> capital <b>associations</b> (limited liability companies, joint stock companies) in dealings {{within the meaning of}} civil law. lt is only the management from among company officials which is in legitimate possession of representation rights. Exceptionally the rights of representation are vested in the supervisory board, whereas the meeting of partners (general assembly) and the auditing committee are destitute of these rights. Combined representation is a rule in deputizing for capital associations. There are however some exceptions to it. The cases are as fallows: establishing a sole management, contractual settlement of other principles of representation and of passive representation <b>of</b> <b>association</b> (by way <b>of</b> capacity to accept declarations of will). The right to represent which is vested in the management is defined very widely. It comprises almost all proceedings in court and elsewhere which are related to operating any business. Thus there is no necessity to limit the concept of management representation to firms belonging to joint companies or to a firm of the same type. In relation to the capital <b>association</b> the members <b>of</b> management are subject to limitations enacted in regulations concerning the associations or limitations established in <b>contracts</b> (statutes) <b>of</b> <b>associations</b> or in resolutions of partners (in general assembly). Participance of the management member in decision making, against the explicit consitnalimts to do so does not influemce the validity of arrived settlements. The possible consequences of this participation may be the managing director's liability for damage, his recalling or suspension by the supervisory board. The mode of representation concerning capital associations is subject to registration in the trade register.

A novel algorithm is developed for the design of gaseous micro distribution systems consisting of long tubes based on linear kinetic theory. Provided that the geometry of the pipe network is fixed the algorithm is capable of estimating the mass flow rates through the pipes as well as the pressure heads at the nodes of the network. The pressure distribution along each pipe element may also be provided. The analysis is valid and the results are accurate in the whole range of the Knudsen number, while the involved computational effort is very small. This is achieved by successfully integrating the well known kinetic results for single tubes into a typical solver for designing gas pipe networks.

The JET machine and associated facilities require significant maintenance and enhancement installation activities {{in support of the}} experimental exploitation programme. A proportion of these activities are within radiological and respiratory hazardous environments. As such, breathing air-fed one-piece pressurised suits provide workers with protection from the inhalation of both airborne tritium and beryllium dust. The design of these suits has essentially developed empirically. There is a practical necessity to improve the design to optimise worker performance, protection and thermal comfort. This paper details the complexity of modeling the three-dimensional thermofluid domain between the inner surface of the suit and under garments that includes mass as well as heat transfer, suiting geometry, human metabolism and respiration and effects of limb movements. The methods used include computational fluid dynamics (CFD), theoretical adaptations of mixed-phase turbulent flow, profile scanning of a suit and actuating life size mannequin and data processing of the images and experimental validation trials.
