40|$|Objective To combine {{insights}} from service users with long-term conditions (LTCs) {{to assist the}} development of a <b>community</b> <b>referral</b> intervention designed to promote engagement and improve access to health-relevant resources. Background Social deprivation and reduced access to resources have been causally linked with social isolation and the ability to manage LTCs. Participation in meaningful activity has been associated with positive health benefits, and strategies to promote access to community activities have shown some potential to improve outcomes for people with LTCs. This suggests the need to develop an engagement and referral intervention in partnership with service users and community groups as part of mainstream self-care support. Method A series of focus groups and interviews with members of community groups in Greater Manchester designed as an iterative and collaborative approach to elicit the role of personal and community networks that support long-term condition management (LTCM) to develop a <b>community</b> <b>referral</b> tool. Results Participants reported a broad range of resources relevant to LTCM that often went beyond the usual concerns associated with self-care. This helped to inform a tool (PLANS) to tailor access to types of community-based resources which can support LTCM. Conclusions Understanding the everyday challenges of living with a LTC highlighted the importance of connecting and engaging with localized support for people. In response to this, we developed an intervention (PLANS) which tailors access to local resources based on personal preferences, needs and acceptability to encourage service users to engage with sustainable health choices...|$|R

These data are concerning given that the existing literature unanimously concludes that children who have experienced maltreatment present with significantly higher rates of mental health difficulties than general samples of children in the community. Given that little Canadian research has been conducted in this area, this study examined the need identification and referral process made to mental health services by Ontario Children’s Aid Societies (CAS) for children who have experienced maltreatment. Findings indicate a high prevalence of mental health difficulties in this population and a limited standardized approach to the identification and assessment of these issues.

40|$|Family {{intervention}} {{literature on}} adolescent parenting describes the pathways between outcomes for adolescent {{mothers and their}} children and the contexts of the pregnancy itself (e. g., poverty, low or no prenatal care, lower educational attainment). The aim of these descriptions is often to inform intervention designs that promote adaptive functioning for the child, the mother, and the dyad.

Using in-house clinicians rather than external providers may be beneficial by decreasing the high attrition rates common to this population. Although this service delivery approach is theoretically appealing, it has not been subject to rigorous empirical evaluation.

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversitySuicide {{among the}} elderly is a growing issue and the {{greatest}} incidence of suicide occurs in elderly white males. Though research has identified risk and protective factors, assessment tools and prevention programs have been developed, few are specifically focused on the elderly. The concept of hopelessness has been investigated in relation to depression and linked to suicidal ideation; in one study the elderly identified spirituality as an unmet need. The attitudes {{and knowledge of the}} young and old, professional and non-professional differ, and have changed over time. Suicide prevention is an issue that cannot be delegated solely to mental health professions because primary care providers {{have been found to be}} a frequent point of contact for the elderly, offering an opportunity to impact their depression, hopelessness and potential suicidal ideation. Basic help for patients may be in the primary care providers approach to patient management and interaction, including a focus on hope renewal, and referral to appropriate community resources. A review of research studies reveals some common agreements on issues as well as areas in need of further research. Incorporating community involvement and referring outside the normal realm of social and medical support may help reduce suicidal deaths. Through a holistic and community approach a reduction in suicide {{among the elderly}} may be realized.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the clinical characteristics of individuals with SUD + PTSD who have a history of CT, with SUD + PTSD individuals who have experienced trauma during adulthood only. Data were collected on 103 individuals as part of a randomised controlled trial examining the efficacy of an integrated psychosocial treatment for SUD + PTSD. Participants were recruited from substance use treatment services, <b>community</b> <b>referrals</b> and advertising. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, substance use and treatment histories, lifetime trauma exposure and current physical and mental health functioning. It was found that the vast majority (77 %) of the sample had experienced at least one trauma before the age of 16, with 55 % of those endorsing childhood sexual abuse. As expected, individuals with a CT history, as compared to without, evidenced significantly longer duration of PTSD. Those with a CT history also had more extensive lifetime trauma exposure, an earlier age of first intoxication and reported more severe substance use (e. g. a greater number of drug classes used in their lifetime, higher severity of dependence scores and greater number of drug treatment episodes). In conclusion, we found that individuals with co-morbid SUD + PTSD who had experienced CT presented with a more severe and chronic clinical profile in relation to a number of trauma and substance use characteristics, when compared to individuals with adulthood only trauma histories. It is, therefore, important for SUD + PTSD treatment planning that CT be carefully assessed...|$|E
40|$|The Internet now hosts an {{ever-increasing}} collection of tools (e. g., list-servers, discussion groups, chat rooms, bulletin boards, social networking sites, and wikis) that help people connect, communicate, and collaborate. The {{development of these}} technological tools, together {{with the desire to}} capitalize on the collective efforts of like-minded individuals has {{led to the formation of}} a wide variety of online communities. While some community oriented ventures have been extremely successful (e. g., MySpace and Wikipedia), this is not the norm. Online communities are faced with significant challenges associated with attracting and maintaining a voluntary membership base - and many fail to do so. The success and failure of these communities lies in their ability to attract and maintain a membership base of users that are willing to participate. A key to attracting and retaining members is to better understand how members join, and how their relationship with the community, impact their behavior in the community. The primary purpose of this dissertation research is to propose and test different aspects of community life that links how people join the community, and the bonds they form with the community, influence their participation in the community. A secondary objective is to expand the conceptualization of participation beyond traditional "frequency of contribution" constructs, to one that incorporates a wider range of community behaviors that need to be performed by a community's members. Towards these objectives, this work examines how two different aspects of community life, joining and commitment, affect different aspects of participation, including content provision, content seeking, and informal moderation. The first study draws on literature of word-of-mouth from marketing and organizational recruiting to explain how community joining processes, specifically member referrals, can shape member participation behaviors. The second study, draws on the organizational commitment literature, to theorize how the member-community relationship impacts member participation. Data to test these models proposed in each study was collected from a large community. The community promotes itself as a "general discussion" community, with the goal of supporting social conversation amongst its members. This dissertation finds that member referrals and community commitment play an important role in members' participation within online communities. These factors exert their influences at different stages of a member's association with a <b>community.</b> <b>Referrals</b> appear to be most influential at the earliest stages of community life, facilitating the return of members after they join and the level of their participation in the short term. This may be useful in helping communities overcome initial judgments of members with respect to the potential value of the community, giving the community a chance. However, communities must also be able to develop committed members to sustain participation in the long term. The commitment that develops between a member and the community influences member's participation, with the various types of commitment (continuance, affective, normative) leading members to participate in different ways. This may be useful in helping community administrators, who face the challenge of achieving an appropriate mix of participation to maintain the quality of the member-generated content pool over time. Taken together the results of the studies presented provide a theoretical foundation for linking relational models of community engagement and content contribution models. In doing so, expands the range of behaviors that should be considered by both researchers and practitioners, and provide a foundation for richer, more powerful, and potentially more useful models of behavior in online contexts...|$|E
