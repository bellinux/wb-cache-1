5|$|Douglas Engelbart, {{the founder}} of SRI's Augmentation Research Center (ARC), was the primary force behind the design and {{development}} of the multi-user oN-Line System (or NLS), featuring original versions of modern computer-human interface elements including bit-mapped displays, collaboration software, hypertext, and precursors to the graphical user interface such as the <b>computer</b> <b>mouse.</b> As a pioneer of human-computer interaction, Engelbart is arguably SRI's most notable alumnus. He was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Carl Engelbart (January 30, 1925– July 2, 2013) was an American {{engineer}} and inventor, {{and an early}} computer and Internet pioneer. He {{is best known for}} his work on founding the field of human–computer interaction, particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International, which resulted in creation of the <b>computer</b> <b>mouse,</b> and the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces. These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968. Engelbart's Law, the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.|$|E

25|$|A <b>computer</b> <b>mouse</b> is a {{pointing}} device (hand control) that detects two-dimensional motion {{relative to a}} surface. This motion is typically translated into the motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of the graphical user interface.|$|E
25|$|Engelbart was a committed, vocal {{proponent of}} the {{development}} and use of computers and computer networks to help cope with the world’s increasingly urgent and complex problems.

25|$|A special type of integrator, used at a {{point where}} only {{moderate}} accuracy was needed, was based on a steel ball, instead of a disc. It had two inputs, one to rotate the ball, and the other to define the angle of the ball's rotating axis. That axis was always in a plane that contained the axes of two movement-pickoff rollers, quite similar to the mechanism of a rolling-ball <b>computer</b> <b>mouse</b> (in this mechanism, the pickoff rollers were roughly the same diameter as the ball). The pickoff roller axes were at right angles.|$|E
25|$|In computing, a mouse is a {{pointing}} device that functions by detecting two-dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface. The mouse's motion typically translates into {{the motion of}} a pointer on a display, which allows for fine control of a Graphical User Interface. Douglas Engelbart invented the <b>computer</b> <b>mouse</b> at the Augmentation Research Center, funded by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (now DARPA) in 1963. The first mouse was carved from wood and tracked motion via two wheels mounted on the bottom. Later on, a ball instead of two wheels was employed. The concept was soon overtaken by a modern and more technologically advanced optical mouse.|$|E
25|$|The live {{demonstration}} {{featured the}} introduction of a complete computer hardware and software system called the oN-Line System or, more commonly, NLS. The 90-minute presentation essentially demonstrated almost all the fundamental elements of modern personal computing: windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation and command input, video conferencing, the <b>computer</b> <b>mouse,</b> word processing, dynamic file linking, revision control, and a collaborative real-time editor (collaborative work). Engelbart's presentation was the first to publicly demonstrate all of these elements in a single system. The demonstration was highly influential and spawned similar projects at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s. The underlying technologies influenced both the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows graphical user interface operating systems in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

25|$|The {{machine was}} similar in {{power to the}} Apple II and {{included}} a small 9-inch black-and-white character display built into a small case with a floppy disk. It was text only, as Raskin disliked the <b>computer</b> <b>mouse</b> {{or anything else that}} could take his hands from the keyboard. A number of basic applications were built into the machine, selectable by pressing function keys. The machine also included logic that would understand user intentions and switch programs dynamically. For instance, if the user simply started typing text it would switch into editor mode, and if they typed numbers it would switch to calculator mode. In many cases these switches would be largely invisible to the user.|$|E
25|$|Resonance of 4 (1994) is a {{collaborative}} music-creation artwork consisting of four adjacent stations, each comprising a small podium bearing a <b>computer</b> <b>mouse,</b> a 16-by-16 grid projected {{onto the floor}} from a video projector above, and a cursor connected to the mouse. Dots can be placed {{in each of the}} grid's cells by clicking with the mouse. A synchronized bar sweeps across all the grids simultaneously, triggering musical notes wherever a dot has been placed. Sound is relayed over a loudspeaker system, and the notes from all four stations are superimposed, although each station has its own musical tone. This work was shown at the Serious Games exhibition at the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle in 1996 and 1997 and at the Barbican Arts Centre, London in 1997.|$|E
25|$|The {{examination}} is of 3 hours duration, {{and contains}} {{a total of}} 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both multiple choice questions (four answer options out of which the correct {{one has to be}} chosen) and numerical answer type questions (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and <b>computer</b> <b>mouse).</b> Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} LucasArts {{adventure}} games, Full Throttle is a single-player video {{game in which}} the player controls {{the actions of the}} player character from a third-person perspective using a <b>computer</b> <b>mouse</b> and point and click interface. By positioning the cursor and clicking the left mouse button, the player causes the player character, Ben, to move around a scene. In certain contexts the cursor will become an arrow (if Ben is on foot) or a directional road sign (if Ben is riding his motorcycle); clicking these causes Ben to travel to another scene. As with other LucasArts graphic adventure games of the era, dialogue plays a large part in the game, presenting story elements and information necessary to advance. During conversations with other characters, several choices of dialogue are presented. The currently selected choice is highlighted, and once clicked, the player character responds with the selected choice. Choosing the correct response allows the player to advance the conversation and ultimately advance the scene.|$|E
25|$|Point-and-click {{adventure}} {{games are}} those where the player typically controls their character through a point-and-click interface using a <b>computer</b> <b>mouse</b> or similar pointing device, though additional control schemes {{may also be}} available. The player clicks to move their character around, interact with non-player characters, often initiating conversation trees with them, examine objects in the game's settings or with their character's item inventory. Many point-and-click games would include a list of on-screen verbs to describe specific actions {{in the manner of}} a text adventure, but newer games have used more context-sensitive user interface elements to reduce or eliminate this approach. Often, these games come down to collecting items for the character's inventory, and figuring where is the right time to use that item; the player would need to use clues from the visual elements of the game, descriptions of the various items, and dialogue from other characters to figure this out. Later games developed by Sierra Online including the King's Quest games, and nearly all of the LucasArts adventure games, are point-and-click based games.|$|E
25|$|The AL10 RX's new {{exterior}} styling adopts the L-finesse design language, {{and outer}} features include a rear spoiler which hides {{the rear window}} wiper and radio antenna creating a less cluttered appearance. The drag coefficient on the latest RX 350 {{has been reduced to}} 0.33 C'd. Exterior dimensions are increased, with cargo room increased by five percent over the prior generation. For the interior, major standard features include SmartAccess, a keyless entry and start system, electrochromic heated side mirrors, UV reducing exterior glass, Bluetooth, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power 10-way driver and passenger seats, sliding and reclining rear seats and a power rear hatch. The instrument cluster's multi-function display uses an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of a thin film transistor (TFT-LCD) display. New cabin technologies include VoiceBox Technologies conversational speech voice recognition system, {{the first of its kind}} in the U.S., which can recognize general speech commands. The new hard disk drive HDD-based navigation system no longer uses a touchscreen, instead replacing it with Lexus' Remote Touch controller, similar in function to a <b>computer</b> <b>mouse,</b> with haptic feedback. Optional accessory features include XM Satellite Radio, a 15-speaker 330-watt Mark Levinson Surround Sound audio system, a dual-screen Rear Seat Entertainment System (RSES), 19-inch wheels, heated and ventilated front seats, power front seat cushion extender, perforated and semi-aniline leather seats, a smog sensor for the HVAC system, power folding side view mirrors, and navigation system. With XM subscription the navigation adds real-time NavTraffic and NavWeather updates.|$|E
