40|$|Physiological {{functions}} of a specimen of fruits or vegetables in storage follow trends {{that are either}} 'normal' or 'abnormal'. Normal functioning will produce changes that are known to occur under optimal storage conditions, and that result in an optimal market quality. Abnormal functioning {{may lead to the}} appearance of the typical symptoms of a storage disease. The beginning of abnormal functioning is supposed to be marked by a deviation from {{one or more of the}} normal trends. To detect possible deviations, trends of physiological {{functions of}} stored produce were followed. A new type of <b>conditioning</b> <b>machine</b> was used, a description of which is given in chapter 3. The apparatus allows a number of test objects (single specimens) to be viewed from all sides, without disturbing their storage conditions, and without interfering with other determinations made on the test material. The storage conditions can be kept independent from the temperature, the composition and the barometric pressure of the outer atmosphere. One of the trends that can be followed in the <b>conditioning</b> <b>machine</b> is the CO 2 -production rate. A new method is described (chapter 4) that allows the CO 2 -production rates of seventy apples, kept at low storage temperature, to be recorded individually, within four hours, with an experimental error not exceeding 2 %. From each apple in turn, a stream of air carrying respiratory CO 2 is mixed with a flow of titrant, a solution of potassium methanolate in acetone and methanol, 0. 001 to 0. 004 N. The supply of titrant is adjusted until equivalent with the rate of CO 2 absorbed. Adjustment is made by means of a variable air pressure, which is read on a manometer. For a number of rates of CO 2 supply the 'equivalent manometer value' was compared with gravimetric measurement of CO 2; the relation between the two was linear, so that the 'equivalent manometer values' could be used as a measure of CO 2 production rates of individual apple specimens. Deviations from 'normal' trends of CO 2 production of Jonathan apples were found to start either spontaneously (i. e., apparently not induced by an environmental factor) or to be induced by a transient change in the storage temperature. In one season, spontaneous deviations were found to start several weeks before the first symptoms of decay appeared on the surface of the fruit; in another season, this sequence was reversed. This might indicate either that the two effects do not have a common cause, or that host-parasite relationships vary from one season to another (section 4. 2. 2. 2). A transient thermal stimulus was found to induce deviations that were either transient or apparently irreversible (section 4. 2. 2. 3). The reversible character of a deviation would show within a few days or weeks, after which the previous trend would be resumed. Irreversible deviations sometimes brought to light differences between specimens that had followed identical courses before the stimulus was applied. Also, specific differences were found: Boskoop apples showed a deviation one day later than Jonathan apples, and less pronounced. In an Appendix, a description is given of a new closed container method for the determination of CO 2 -production rates of single specimens and of composite samples of apples and other objects. New methods have also been tried to study softening of fruits in store. The 'METTLER Compressor' is a precision balance provided with a plunger (section 5. 2. 2). The 'Bellows Compressor' is a (plastic) bellows provided with a plunger; it operates by means of a variable hydrostatic pressure read on a liquid manometer (section 5. 2. 3). Determinations with these compressors necessitate the transfer of test fruits from storage conditions to the apparatus. In case the test fruits should be left in the same environment, the 'Hydraulic Sweller' and/or the 'Hydraulic Belt' are alternatives. The one can be fixed inside a fruit, the other around a fruit. Both operate by means of a variable hydrostatic pressure which causes a liquid meniscus in a transparent capillary tube to move; the displacement serves as a measure of the induced deformation. Deformations in the order of 0. 005 to 0. 04 mm/day were established, the experimental error being less than 0. 001 mm. Such deformations, when found with the aid of a hydraulic belt, seem to be caused by both softening and shrinkage of the test fruits. Hydraulic swellers allowed the beginning of internal rotting in apple and pear fruits to be read from a distance. The Bellows compressor, showed different manometer readings representing 'firmness values' on the equator of tomato fruits: over cross-walls, firmness values were 4. 7 % ± 1. 16 higher than over locules (section 5. 3. 4). The tomato blossom end was found to provide firmness values that were in close correlation with the grade of colouring of the fruits (section 5. 3. 5). In the course of time, blossom-end firmness values of tomato fruits (as determined with the bellows apparatus) gradually decreased, parallel with the change in colour (table 1). The plunger of the compressor gained 0. 007 to 0. 025 mm/day, the experimental error being 0. 01 to 0. 02 mm. These results are not affected by shrinkage of the fruits. Tests have been made on objects that changed their consistence, within a few minutes, while being subjected to alternating pressures. In a jellifying mixture, the alternating time-deformation curves changed from rectilinear to asymptotic whereas the opposite tendency occurred in fruits that were subjected to an injurious electric current (section 5. 3. 7). With the aid of a METTLER Compressor, different spots on the surface of an apple fruit were tested. They appeared to be identical as to their yield point. but different as to the point of rupture of their skin (section 5. 3. 2). In tomatoes, no yield point appeared, although the test resulted in a distinct indentation in the surface of the test fruit...|$|E
40|$|Empirical surveys find no {{significant}} impact of environmental regulation and environmental costs on international competitiveness. In the literature, {{we can find}} three hypotheses {{on the impact of}} environmental regulation. For the industrial-flight and pollution-haven hypothesis, there is no clear empirical evidence. We show that this is a logical consequence of the principle of comparative advantage. Another explanation can be that developed countries have very diversified exports and most surveys do not link regulation to specific products. We therefore investigate the link between export diversification and two measures of labour productivity. The Porter hypothesis - the third or revisionist hypothesis in our overview - states that environmental regulation can lead to improved competitiveness. Many authors only find 'anecdotal' evidence for this hypothesis but we show that when regulation is linked to specific products, there is clear evidence for the Porter hypothesis.

40|$|The {{energy and}} {{environmental}} performance of refrigeration and air <b>conditioning</b> <b>machines</b> are commonly described by their Total Equivalent Warming Impact, so called TEWI, which {{is defined as the}} sum of the indirect and direct emissions. The direct emissions are related to charge inventory of the system and to the type of refrigerant used, while the indirect emissions basically depend on the system energy performance. Even if there is a strong interest in the new low-GWP refrigerants, the traditional HFC fluids, with huge GWPs, are still widely used in the refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. For this reason, there is a still strong demand of innovative solutions which can be implemented with the current fluids and then applied to the new ones, when there will be the final phase-out of the HFCs. From this standpoint, looking at the TEWI index, the charge minimization and the system performance optimization represent the main targets of the innovation to cope with the environmental challenges. Since the early 1970 s, traditional microfin tubes have been widely used in air and water heat exchangers for heat pump and refrigerating applications because they have been demonstrated to significantly improve the heat transfer performance during both in-tube condensation and boiling. The possible downsizing of microfin tubes could lead to more efficient and compact heat exchangers and thus to a reduction of the refrigerant charge of the systems and to an overall improving of their performance. Nowadays, large manufacturers are exploring the possible use of mini microfin tubes and there is a strong interest in understanding the heat transfer and pressure drop behaviours of this enhanced tube. This paper presents the R 134 a flow boiling heat transfer and pressure drop measurements inside a mini microfin tube with internal diameter at the fin tip of 4. 3 mm. This study is carried out in a new experimental facility built at the Dept. of Management and Engineering of the University of Padova. The microfin tube was brazed inside a copper plate and electrically heated from the bottom. Sixteen T-type thermocouples are located in the copper plate to monitor the temperature distribution during the heat transfer process.

Furthermore, five MD sessions with 25 ns beams took place in the period June-October, but the quality of these beams was always deteriorated by severe electron cloud effects. However, a clear improvement was noticed also with the 25 ns runs. An estimation of the present state of <b>conditioning</b> of the <b>machine</b> and the required scrubbing time can be inferred from electron cloud simulations compared with measured data...|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} in the target area is increased by recirculating its air through the <b>machine's</b> <b>conditioning</b> system. The system heats and lowers the relative humidity of the air being conditioned. The conditioned air is fed into the target drying area either directly or through ducts. The structure gradually warms up and vapor pressure is lowered - promoting evaporation. Evaporated water increases the relative humidity in the drying area. This could result in evaporation ceasing if saturation is achieved and secondary damage to the target area or {{to other areas of}} the property not originally damaged. So, to deal with this the process can either switch to exhaust mode in the portable systems, expelling the wet air to the outside or repeatedly venting the air to the outside via a heat exchanger in the trailer process. As wet air is expelled and at the same time, outside fresh air in equal amounts is drawn into the systems conditioning system and it is then introduced back into the room to repeat the process until the property is dry. A dry state is determined when the exhaust specific humidity drops below intake specific humidity at which stage the heater and machines air exchange fans are automatically turned off and the technician notified by email or text that the building is dry. Unlike traditional dehumidifiers, convectant systems work efficiently across all temperature ranges.|$|R
