Water and sewer tariffs in Uruguay have increased substantially since 1995. For example, a typical residential water bill (20 m³/month, 700 cu ft/month) for OSE consumers increased from the equivalent of 56 pesos/month (US$9.50) in 1995 to 207 pesos/month (US$18.20) in 2001, a 93% increase in US dollar terms in six years. Tariffs were further increased so that a typical residential bill reached 431 pesos/month in 2003. But due to the massive devaluation of 2001 the US dollar equivalent of the monthly bill decreased to US$15/month. In 2007 a monthly residential water bill {{was estimated to be}} at least 568 pesos, equivalent to more than US$22/month.|$|E

30|$|Preassignment-and-reassignment algorithms: In preassignment, {{certain amount}} of resources, {{subchannel}} or power for instance, are initially pre-allocated as base resources to some or all users before the other resources are now optimally shared among the remaining users. As the algorithm runs, more resources are allocated to all or a <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> to achieve a higher overall capacity or productivity. After one or more runs, the algorithm may check that the constraints are not violated and should there still be some residual resources, a reallocation (or reassignment) of resources is again carried out to seek to improve the overall utility of the network. Examples {{of the use of}} this heuristic method can be found in references [19, 72].|$|E
