25|$|The IBAN {{consists}} {{of up to}} 34 alphanumeric characters comprising: a country code; two check digits; and a number that includes the domestic bank account number, branch identifier, and potential routing information. The <b>check</b> <b>digits</b> enable a sanity check of the bank account number to confirm its integrity before submitting a transaction.|$|E
25|$|The <b>check</b> <b>digits</b> {{enable the}} sending bank (or its customer) {{to perform a}} sanity check of the routing {{destination}} and account number from a single string of data {{at the time of}} data entry. This check is guaranteed to detect any instances where a single character has been omitted, duplicated, mistyped or where two characters have been transposed. Thus routing and account number errors are virtually eliminated.|$|E
25|$|IBAN {{imposes a}} {{flexible}} but regular format sufficient for account identification and contains validation information to avoid errors of transcription. It carries all the routing {{information needed to}} get a payment from one bank to another wherever it may be; it contains key bank account details such as country code, branch codes (known as sort codes in the UK and Ireland) and account numbers, and it contains <b>check</b> <b>digits</b> which can be validated at source according to a single standard procedure. Where used, IBANs have reduced trans-national money transfer errors to under 0.1% of total payments.|$|E
50|$|The <b>check</b> <b>digit</b> {{is derived}} by {{dividing}} the 7 digit Serial Number by 7. The remainder determines the <b>Check</b> <b>Digit.</b> Example: Serial Number 8114074 divided by 7 is 1159153 with remainder 4. Therefore the Serial Number + <b>Check</b> <b>Digit</b> is 81140744.|$|R

50|$|The last {{number of}} the IMEI is a <b>check</b> <b>digit</b> {{calculated}} using the Luhn algorithm, as defined in the IMEI Allocation and Approval Guidelines:The <b>Check</b> <b>Digit</b> shall be calculated according to Luhn formula (ISO/IEC 7812). (See GSM 02.16 / 3GPP 22.016). The <b>Check</b> <b>Digit</b> {{is a function of}} all other digits in the IMEI. The Software Version Number (SVN) of a mobile is not included in the calculation.The purpose of the <b>Check</b> <b>Digit</b> is to help guard against the possibility of incorrect entries to the CEIR and EIR equipment.The presentation of the <b>Check</b> <b>Digit</b> both electronically and in printed form on the label and packaging is very important. Logistics (using bar-code reader) and EIR/CEIR administration cannot use the <b>Check</b> <b>Digit</b> unless it is printed outside of the packaging, and on the ME IMEI/Type Accreditation label.The <b>check</b> <b>digit</b> is not transmitted over the radio interface, nor is it stored in the EIR database at any point. Therefore, all references to the last three or six digits of an IMEI refer to the actual IMEI number, to which the <b>check</b> <b>digit</b> does not belong.|$|R
25|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 1 February 2014 deadline, it became {{apparent}} that many old bank account numbers had not been allocated IBANsan issue that has to be addressed on a country-by-country basis. In Germany, for example, the German Federal Bank and the German Banking Industry Committee require that all holders of German bank codes ("Bankleitzahl") publish the specifics of their IBAN generation format taking into account not only the generation of <b>check</b> <b>digits</b> but also the handling of legacy bank codes, thereby enabling third parties to generate IBANs independently of the bank. The first such catalogue was published in June 2013 as a variant of the old bank code catalog ("Bankleitzahlendatei").|$|E
25|$|Before IBAN, differing {{national}} standards for bank account identification (i.e. bank, branch, routing codes, and account number) were confusing for some users. This often led to necessary routing information being missing from payments. Routing information as specified by ISO 9362 (also known as Business Identifier Codes (BIC code), SWIFT ID or SWIFT code, and SWIFT-BIC) {{does not require a}} specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. It also does not contain <b>check</b> <b>digits,</b> so errors of transcription were not detectable and it was not possible for a sending bank to validate the routing information prior to submitting the payment. Routing errors caused delayed payments and incurred extra costs to the sending and receiving banks and often to intermediate routing banks.|$|E

2500|$|According to the ECBS [...] "generation of the IBAN {{shall be}} the {{exclusive}} responsibility of the bank/branch servicing the account".
