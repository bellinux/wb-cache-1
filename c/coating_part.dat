The existing old drive of the press and the drive of drying groups were established as a Line Shaft Drive, 76 m long. The novel drive is developed on the basis of conventional squirrel cage induction motor application, with frequency converter. The system control is carried out with the programmable controller, and the communication between controllers, converters, and control boards is accomplished trough profibus. Reconstruction of the <b>coating</b> <b>part</b> of the machine, during technological reconstruction of this part of the machine, was being conducted with a purpose to improve performance of the machine by adding device for spreading "third coating". The demands for the power facility were to replace existing facility with the new one, based on energy efficiency principles and to provide adequate facility for new technological sections. Also, new part of the facility had to be connected with the remaining part of the machine, i. e. with the press and drying part, which have been reconstructed in 2001. It has to be stressed that energy efficiency principles means to realize new, modernized drive with better performances and greater capacity for the as small as possible amount of increased installed power of separate drives. In the paper are also, graphically presented achieved energy savings results, based on measurements performed on separate parts of paper machine, before and after reconstruction. ...|$|E
40|$|The fibre-optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensor is broadly {{accepted}} as a structural health monitoring device for fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) materials by either embedding into or bonding onto the structures. The accuracy of the strain measured by using the FBG sensor is highly dependent on the bonding characteristics among the bare optical fibre, protective coating, adhesive layer and host material. In general, the signal extracted from the embedded FBG sensor should reflect the straining condition of the host structure. However, due {{to the existence of}} an adhesive layer and protective <b>coating,</b> <b>part</b> of the energy would convert into shear deformation. Therefore, the mechanical properties of these materials would aect the resultant strain measured by embedding a FBG sensor into the structure. This paper presents a theoretical model to evaluate the dierential strains between the bare fibre and host material with dierent adhesive thickness and modulus of the protective coating of the embedded FBG sensor. The results are then compared with numerical analysis by using the finite element method (FEM). Experimental work was conducted for both glass fibre composites and FRP strengthened concrete beams with embedded FBG sensors. Externally bonded strain gauges were used to compare the results obtained from the FBG sensors. The theoretical predictions reveal that the axial strain measured at the fibre-core region is lower than the true strain of the host material with increasing thickness of adhesive layer. A thick adhesive layer and low modulus of coating material would enlarge the shear stress concentration area at the bonded end region. An experimental investigation also shows that the FBG sensor can be confidently used with sucient bond length. Ó 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Sol is prepared by dissolving silicon tetraalk(en) oxide (I) in 1 - 5 carbon (C) aliphatic alcohol (II), prehydrolysis, dissolving or reacting a titanium tetraalk(en) oxide (III) in or with beta -keto-esters and/or beta -diketone, adding this {{solution to the}} first and dilution.

40|$|Abstract. The inverse {{scattering}} for {{an obstacle}} D ⊂ R 2 with mixed boundary condition {{can be considered}} as a prototype for radar detection of complex obstacles with <b>coated</b> and noncoated <b>parts</b> of the boundary. We construct some indicator functions for this inverse problem using the far-field pattern directly, without the necessity of transforming the far field to the near field. Based on careful singularity analysis, these indicator functions enable us to reconstruct the shape of the obstacle and distinguish the coated from the noncoated part of the boundary. Moreover, an explicit representation formula for the surface impedance in the <b>coated</b> <b>part</b> of the boundary is also given. Our reconstruction scheme reveals that the <b>coated</b> <b>part</b> of the obstacle is less visible than the noncoated one, which corresponds to the physical fact that the coated boundary absorbs some part of the scattered wave. Numerics are presented for the reconstruction formulas, which show that both the boundary shape and the surface impedance in the <b>coated</b> <b>part</b> of the boundary can be reconstructed accurately. The theoretical reconstruction techniques proposed in this work can be applied in the practical 3 -dimensional electromagnetic inverse scattering problems with promising numerical performance. Such problems are of great importance in the design of nondetectable obstacles...|$|R

Part I: Radiative cooling by polymer-nanoparticle composite coatings. Thermal management is a major field of interest in academia and industry. As electronics become faster and smaller, heat dissipation is a problem of concern. Conventional techniques (heat sinks, mechanical fans) are bulky, consume external power and may not be suitable for these challenges. Use of coatings to enhance heat dissipation by radiative cooling is an attractive option, since they are almost space-less and independent of surroundings. In this work, nanodiamond powder (NDP), multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), and carbon black (CB) were dispersed in acrylate emulsion (AC) to form composite materials. These materials were coated on aluminum panels (alloy 3003) to give thin coatings, termed "molecular fan - MF". The order of lattice quantization, as investigated by Raman spectroscopy, is in the order of MWCNT > CB >> NDP. The enhanced surface emissivity of the MF coating (as observed by IR imaging) is well-correlated to lattice quantization; resulting in better cooling performance by MWCNT-AC composite. MF coatings with different concentrations (0 %, 0. 4 %, 0. 7 %, and 1 %) of MWCNT were prepared. The equilibrium temperature lowering of the coated panel was observed with increased loading of carbon nanotubes and was measured as 17 °C for 1 % loading of MWCNT. This was attributed to increased density of active phonons in the MF <b>coating.</b> <b>Part</b> II: An instrument for evaluation of performance of heat dissipative coatings. An instrument is developed to evaluate the performance of heat dissipative coatings. The instrument has features to measure the apparent emissivity of a given surface under different input power settings. The emissivity of aluminum (Al Q-panel) and copper, as measured from 60 - 135 °C, showed a value of 0. 15 +/- 0. 03 and 0. 42 +/- 0. 05 respectively, consistent with reported values in literature. The relative emissivity of a heat dissipative coating, called as molecular fan carbon nanotube 'MF-CNT', was found to be ∼ 0. 97. A simple mathematical model is built to evaluate the role of different heat transfer mechanisms (convection and radiation) on cooling performance, and it was observed that convection plays a dominant role in cooling, with more than 90 % of heat transferred by convection. In presence of MF-CNT coating, radiation heat transfer increases to ∼ 30 % and lowers the steady state temperature by 10 °C. It is illustrated that radiative cooling could be a significant factor in thermal management. Part III: Formulation of hard coatings for application on PVC.

In contrast to previous coated TDR probes, our probe {{may be used}} to measure both the dielectric constant (K-a) and bulk electrical conductivity (sigma(a)) in saline porous media.

The conductor and shield of the other coaxial cable were connected to each of the two outer rods, respectively. Thus, our probe consists of two unbalanced, two-rod probes. The probe is called coated-uncoated probe (CUP). Four prototypes with two different coating materials (i. e., polyolefin and kynar heat-shrink tubes) were evaluated. The probes were calibrated in several fluids having different K-a and sigma(a). The K-a measurement of the <b>coated</b> <b>part</b> the probe was successfully fitted to target K-a using a two-phase dielectric mixing model.
