25|$|Sanctions {{have reduced}} Iran's access to {{products}} {{needed for the}} oil and energy sectors, have prompted many oil companies to withdraw from Iran, and have also caused a decline in oil production due to reduced access to technologies needed to improve their efficiency. According to Undersecretary of State William Burns, Iran may be annually losing as much as $60 billion in energy investment. Many international companies have also been reluctant {{to do business with}} Iran for fear of losing access to larger Western markets. As well as restricting export markets, the sanctions have reduced Iran's oil income by increasing the costs of repatriating revenues in complicated ways that sidestep the sanctions; Iranian analysts estimate the budget deficit for the 2011/2012 fiscal year, which in Iran ends in late March, at between $30bn to $50bn. The effects of U.S. sanctions include expensive basic goods for Iranian citizens, and an aging and increasingly unsafe civil aircraft fleet. According to the Arms Control Association, the international arms embargo against Iran is slowly reducing Iran's military capabilities, largely due to its dependence on Russian and Chinese military assistance. The only substitute is to find <b>compensatory</b> <b>measures</b> requiring more time and money, and which are less effective. According to at least one analyst (Fareed Zakaria), the market for imports in Iran is dominated by state enterprises and state-friendly enterprises, because the way to get around the sanctions is smuggling, and smuggling requires strong connections with the government. This has weakened Iranian civil society and strengthened the state.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this letter is to inform NRC of changes that we have {{incorporated}} into the TRM. Specifically, TRM Revision 8 added the requirements for electrical equipment protective devices. This revision was performed in conjunction with Sequoyah Technical Specifications Amendments 250 and 241 for Units 1 and 2, respectively, and provided for the relocation of these requirements to the TRM. Revision 9 of the TRM added a more conservative requirement for the reactor coolant system specific activity average limit. This addition was utilized as a <b>compensatory</b> <b>measure</b> for analysis inaccuracies, resulting in the associated Technical Specifications requirements that provide adequate margin for this safety function being suspect. This TRM addition is to be removed after the analysis for specific activity is updated to correct the analysis inaccuracies. Revision 10 of the TRM added a new requirement for the control room air temperature control system.

This paper investigates a possible compensation mechanism between balanced skills and cities, and how this <b>compensatory</b> <b>measure</b> relates to performance. Specifically, we test and find support for the idea put forward by Helsley and Strange (2011) that high market thickness, such as that found in cities, can compensate {{for a lack of}} entrepreneurial skill balance. The results indicate that entrepreneurs with low skill balance benefit more from locating in cities than their counterparts with high skill balance.

[...] "It's well established that cities' finances {{are in a state of}} disorder", Pliny once wrote to Trajan, plans for unnecessary works made in collusion with local contractors being identified as one of the main problems. One of the <b>compensatory</b> <b>measures</b> proposed by Pliny expressed a thoroughly Roman conservative position: as the cities' financial solvency depended on the councilmen' purses, it was necessary to have more councilmen on the local city councils. According to Pliny, the best way to achieve this was to lower the minimum age for holding a seat on the council, making it possible for more sons of the established oligarchical families to join and thus contribute to civic spending; this was seen as preferable to enrolling non-noble wealthy upstarts.|$|E
50|$|The roadless and {{inaccessible}} {{nature of}} the region made it ideal for some Simba rebels to retreat after their defeat in 1964. Ever since, they have been making a meager living by poaching on wildlife and controlling illegal mining activities inside of Maiko. The presence of the Simba also stems from {{the inability of the}} governing bodies to follow the <b>compensatory</b> <b>measures</b> required by the decree of 1970. This precarious security situation have made it difficult for the rangers to patrol the Park, especially after the ICCN was coerced by the Congolese army into guiding their attacks towards the Simba. Moreover, conservation work has also been hampered by the presence of rebels, culminating in capture and detainment of several survey crews between 2003 and 2005. At least three other rebels groups are known to be active {{in different parts of the}} park, among which the Rwandan Interahamwe in the east.

To pacify the revolt, Prime minister Emilio Colombo offered to build the Fifth Steelwork Centre in Reggio including a railroad stump and the port in Gioia Tauro, an investment of 3 billion lire which would create 10,000 jobs, which softened the people of Reggio Calabria. This so-called [...] "Colombo package" [...] was developed as a <b>compensatory</b> <b>measure</b> for Reggio Calabria's failure to be designated as the regional capital. The coastal area of the Piana di Gioia Tauro, traditionally cultivated with citrus fruit and olive groves, was identified as the appropriate site for the steel plant.

Usually composed of interlocked concrete blocks, pervious concrete or porous asphalt, the traditional permeable pavements do not always comply with the required levels of permeability. In this context, this paper analyzed the in situ infiltration capacity of articulated concrete blocks as alternative material for surface layer, differentiated by their structure and geometrical design. Therefore, a 20 -m-long and 5 -m-wide pavement test section was constructed at the University of São Paulo Campus, which allowed determining the permeability coefficient in a field evaluation. Hence, the values obtained were compared to those from the pertinent literature using conventional materials. The test {{results showed that the}} articulated concrete block presents a high permeability of around 10 - 3 m/s, being considerably greater than those found in pavements built with both interlocked concrete blocks and with porous asphalt...|$|R

50|$|During the {{treatment}} of aphagia (or dysphagia), {{it is important to}} provide adequate nutrition and hydration. If a person is not able to tolerate a regular diet, diet modifications and alternative means of nutrition may be considered. These include thickening liquids (typical thickening hierarchy is nectar/syrup thick, honey thick, and pudding thick) or by changing the texture of the solid foods to reduce the required amount of mastication (chewing) needed or to reduce other symptoms of oral dysphagia (such as buccal pocketing or anterior loss). Alternative means of nutrition may also be needed in more severe cases (such as when a person is deemed NPO and is not safe to eat anything orally). In these cases, nasogastric (NG) or percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy (PEG) tubes may be placed. Other <b>compensatory</b> <b>measures</b> may include reducing the bolus size (small bites/sips) or postural strategies (such as tucking the chin, turning the head to one side or the other). A speech-lanuguage pathologist is one professional who evaluates and treats aphagia and dysphagia and can recommend these strategies depending on the etiology of the deficit and the location of the breakdown within the swallowing mechanism. True treatment of aphagia/dysphagia comes from neuromuscular re-education and strengthening/coordination in most cases. This can be achieved by use of pharyngeal strengthening exercises, thermal stimulation of the swallowing trigger and oral motor exercises. In some cases, it is also appropriate to complete therapeutic exercises in conjunction with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) which utilizes low-level electrical currents to target muscle fibers from an external source (electrodes placed {{on the surface of the}} skin in strategic places to target muscles and nerves needed during the swallowing process).|$|E

The results of this analysis highlight differences between <b>compensatory</b> <b>measures</b> and their associated costs depending on the category of ecosystem services targeted. Maintenance costs are high for regulating services, low for provisioning services, and more difficult to determine for cultural services (high or low depending on the indicator selected).

In an attempt to elucidate its response to cerebrospinal fluid leakage, male young adult Wistar rats were subjected to lumbar spinal transection under intraperitoneal Nembutal anaesthesia. Control animals received a sham operation, involving opening up the cerebrospinal fluid space and its closure. A scanning electron microscopical study of the third ventricular ependyma on the seventh postoperative day revealed pronounced surface modifications in the experimental animal which included (i) bulbous dilatations in the ciliary shafts with frequent apical blebbing, and an overall turgid appearance of most cilia; (ii) a profusion of tall and stout microvilli in the non-ciliated zones; (iii) {{an increase in the}} size and number of blebs; and (iv) a greater number of supraependymal cells especially on the ventricular floor. The significance of these changes is discussed in the light of available studies.

We compare the connectivity estimated with the least-cost path with our proposed methodology, observing even absence of significant differences at global scale, but not to local scale in our study area. Our results highlight the potential relative importance of each node habitat patch and corridor for the conservation of global connectivity.
