5|$|Modern {{experimental}} {{archaeology and}} history re-enactment have shown {{there is only}} a very short step from the Catalan forge to the true blast furnace, where the iron is gained as pig iron in liquid phase. Usually, obtaining the iron in liquid phase is actually undesired, and the temperature is intentionally kept below the melting point of iron, since while removing the solid bloom mechanically is tedious and means batch process instead of <b>continuous</b> <b>process,</b> it is almost pure iron and can be worked immediately. On the other hand, pig iron is the eutectic mixture of carbon and iron and needs to be described to produce steel or wrought iron, which was extremely tedious in the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Born in Newport, Delaware, Evans {{received}} little formal education {{and in his}} mid-teens was apprenticed to a wheelwright. Going into business with his brothers, he worked {{for over a decade}} designing, building and perfecting an automated mill with devices such as bucket chains and conveyor belts. In doing so Evans designed a <b>continuous</b> <b>process</b> of manufacturing that required no human labor. This novel concept would prove critical to the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production. Later in life Evans turned his attention to steam power, and built the first high-pressure steam engine in the United States in 1801, developing his design independently of Richard Trevithick, who built the first in the world a year earlier. Evans was a driving force in the development and adoption of high-pressure steam engines in the United States. Evans dreamed of building a steam-powered wagon and would eventually construct and run one in 1805. Known as the Oruktor Amphibolos, it was the first automobile in the country and the world's first amphibious vehicle, although it was too primitive to be a success as either.|$|E

Most production networks however, involve batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>processes.</b> Based {{on the same}} principles, this paper extends the proposed formulation to describe <b>continuous</b> <b>processes.</b> Two industrial case studies from the Fast Moving Consumer Goods Manufacturing are presented to illustrate the capability of the proposed formulation to describe plants with both batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>processes,</b> to incorporate clean-up requirements and to consider storage requirements and limitations.

5|$|In his lifetime, J. R. R. Tolkien {{never ceased}} to {{experiment}} on his constructed languages, {{and they were}} subjected to many revisions. Therefore, Quenya had many grammars with substantial differences between the different stages of its development. During the first conceptual stage of early Quenya c. 1910 to c. 1920, the language was called Elfin in English and Eldarissa in Qenya proper. While its development was a <b>continuous</b> <b>process,</b> Quenya underwent {{a number of major}} revisions in its grammar, mostly in conjugation and the pronominal system. The vocabulary, however, was not subject to sudden or extreme change. Tolkien sometimes changed the meaning of a word, but he almost never discarded it once invented, and he kept on refining its meaning, and countlessly forged new synonyms. Moreover, Elvish etymology was in constant flux. Tolkien delighted in inventing new etymons for his Quenya vocabulary. But after the publication of The Lord of the Rings (finished c. 1949–1950, published in 1954–1955), the grammar rules of Quenya went through very few changes and this version was then defined as late Quenya (c. 1950–1973).|$|E

25|$|Anaerobic digesters can be {{designed}} and engineered to operate using {{a number of different}} configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. <b>continuous</b> <b>process</b> mode, mesophilic vs. thermophilic temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a <b>continuous</b> <b>process</b> digester. Higher heat energy is demanded in a thermophilic system compared to a mesophilic system and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content. For solids content, low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as dry digestion. In a single stage process, one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases.|$|E

40|$|Sources of {{disturbances}} {{are often}} difficult to identify in <b>continuous</b> <b>processes,</b> as the process flows are complex. There are, however, several methods {{that can be used}} to monitor flows in complex processes and thereby to improve traceability. Radio frequency identification (RFID) technique is one such method that has been extensively used in parts production for improving traceability. The application of the technique in <b>continuous</b> <b>processes</b> is, however, sparse. The RFID technique offers the possibility to create unique tags with different characteristics that can be detected at specific locations in the process flow. With RFID, virtual batches, possible to follow through the production process, could be created in many types of <b>continuous</b> <b>processes.</b> To report the suitability of using RFID in <b>continuous</b> <b>processes,</b> experiments were conducted in a distribution chain of iron ore pellets produced at LKAB in Malmberget. In a set of experiments eight tag containers were added to the product flow to test the behavior and ability of tag readers to detect the different containers. Three characteristics were varied among the containers: shape, coating mixture and size of tag. The results from the experiments show that large tags increase the read rate, and that no significant effect on read rate could be detected when coating mixtures and shapes were shifted. A conclusion is that the RFID technique could be used to improve traceability in the distribution chain for pellets. Finally, different advantages of improved traceability in <b>continuous</b> <b>processes</b> are discussed. Godkänd; 2008; 20080915 (bjokva...|$|R
