5|$|In early 1977, TSR {{created the}} first element of a two-pronged {{strategy}} that would divide D for nearly two decades. A Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set boxed edition was introduced that <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> presentation of the essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, {{the first part of}} Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the Basic Set directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E

5|$|O'Neill {{started the}} 1964–65 {{tour of the}} West Indies strongly, scoring a century in the first match against Jamaica. He was often injured during the tour, but was at his most {{productive}} with the bat since the last series against the Caribbean team four years earlier. He made many starts, passing 20 in six of his seven Test innings, {{but was unable to}} convert them into big scores. In the First Test, O'Neill was struck on the hand by Wes Hall and was sent to hospital for X-rays after a break was suspected. During the Second Test, it was the turn of Charlie Griffith to send O'Neill to hospital, after hitting him on the forearm and causing a large bruise. His 51 and 74* in the Fourth Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, the last Test of his career, was the only time he passed 50 for the series. He ended with 266 runs at 44.33, missing the Fifth Test due to a broken hand. He managed a healthy return with the ball, taking nine of his 17 Test wickets in the series with an average of 25.55. This included his Test best of 4/41 with his leg-spinin the Second Test in Port of Spain, Trinidad. In this match, he <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hosts' tail in the first innings, removing Jackie Hendriks, Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith and Lance Gibbs.|$|E

25|$|Noroviruses are {{transmitted}} directly {{from person to}} person (62–84% of all reported outbreaks) and indirectly via contaminated water and food. They are extremely contagious, and fewer than twenty virus particles can cause an infection (some research suggests as few as five).

25|$|Half an hour {{into the}} final day, Warne finally turned the tide back in favour of the Australians and {{effectively}} sealed the victory. Thorpe pushed forward to a fuller delivery and missed it, then Hick was caught {{off the back of}} his bat after the ball ricocheted off his arm. Gooch added 30 with Gatting and another 30 with wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes, but both managed to nick the new ball to Healy off McDermott's bowling. Warne <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tail to finish with match figures of 11–108 and pick up the man-of-the-match award, and the game was over before tea on the final day, England mustering 323.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the Charles de Gaulle {{government}} <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> French Penal Code, principally {{getting rid}} of the anti-Semitic laws. The article against homosexual relations between adults and minors, however, remained in force until 1982. The homophobic atmosphere of the 1940s-1960s meant that for the returning victims, the possibility of telling their story was thwarted by the fear of further stigmatisation. In his book, Seel also notes an increase of homophobic attacks in Mulhouse, after the war. In his family itself, Seel found a negative reaction to his homosexuality. His closest relatives decided to avoid broaching the subject while other members of the extended family made humiliating jokes. His godfather disinherited him.|$|E

Giuliani ran an aggressive campaign, parlaying his image as a tough leader who had <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> city.

25|$|With the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Reagan and Congress {{sought to}} simplify the tax system by {{eliminating}} many deductions, reducing the highest marginal rates, and {{reducing the number of}} tax brackets. In 1983, Democrats Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt had offered a proposal; in 1984 Reagan had the Treasury Department produce its own plan. The eventual bipartisan 1986 act aimed to be revenue-neutral: while it reduced the top marginal rate, it also <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tax base by removing certain tax write-offs, preferences, and exceptions, thus raising the effective tax on activities previously specially favored by the code. Ultimately, the combination of the decrease in deductions and decrease in rates, raised revenue equal to about 4% of existing tax revenue.|$|E
25|$|By 1953, {{however, the}} {{property}} had become neglected and fallen into serious disrepair. Some {{of the local}} families got together and restored it, raising money through a Grange fair. They were able to repaint the interior and exterior and replace the roof. In {{the process of the}} latter work they removed the chimney completely; a pile of bricks was found in the nearby woods during a later renovation. A neighboring couple <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> landscaping and gravestones. Six years after this restoration, Thomas Miller's granddaughter Ruth was married to Ernest Pinckney, another descendant of an old West Somers family, in the church. It was the last ceremony held in the building; the last burial in the graveyard took place in 1977.|$|E
25|$|A menacing spell from Shoaib Akhtar, who got six wickets for 16 runs, {{including}} the first five as Gloucestershire crashed to 22 for 5, left Gloucestershire Gladiators without any hope in the bottom-fight at New Road, Worcester.

After Akhtar was taken off, Malinga Bandara and Mark Alleyne set about trying to bat out fifty overs, but Alleyne was caught by Worcestershire Royals' Vikram Solanki and Kabir Ali <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tail with two wickets as Gloucestershire were all out for 105. Bandara then got the wickets of Stephen Moore and Vikram Solanki with successive deliveries, but Chris Gayle guided the hosts home with an unbeaten 53 off 70 balls, as Worcestershire won with more than 20 overs to spare.|$|E

25|$|Sri Lanka {{continued}} on their merry {{path in the}} second innings, as Mohammad Rafique and Enamul Haque toiled {{for the better part}} of the morning and afternoon sessions to little reward. A slow pitch rewarded gritty batting, as shown by Thilan Samaraweera's four-hour 78. Fifties also came from Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan - the latter was last out, missing an attempted pull shot as the ball from Rasel clattered into his stumps, bowled for 86. Rafique had <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lower order earlier, removing Chaminda Vaas, Herath and Muralitharan en route to his sixth five-wicket-haul of his career, but Dilhara Fernando had lasted for 30 minutes with Dilshan when Rasel broke through. With the score 370 for 9, Sri Lanka didn't bother to send the rabbit Lasith Malinga in to bat, and Marvan Atapattu declared.|$|E
25|$|The Indian batsmen {{took a few}} runs before Australia {{took four}} wickets for just two runs, closing the innings at 330. In reply, India's young pace attack kept Australia down with some fine swing bowling, pushing Australia down to 5/61. Andrew Symonds and Adam Gilchrist then put up an attacking 102 run {{partnership}} to engineer an Australian revival but were soon dismissed in quick succession. Indian captain Anil Kumble claimed Symonds as his 600th Test wicket. The pacers then <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tail, overcoming a few minor scares from tailenders Mitchell Johnson and Shaun Tait. Australia finished at 212, 118 runs behind, leaving the Indian batsmen to negotiate the last hour of the day's play. Stuart Clark took an early wicket, dismissing Wasim Jaffer, leaving India with a lead of 170 with nine wickets remaining at stumps with Sehwag and nightwatchman Irfan Pathan at the crease.|$|E
25|$|The CIB hired renowned {{forensic}} scientist Henry Lee ({{forensic scientist}}) {{to examine the}} physical evidence. Dr. Henry Lee was famous for defending O.J.

Dr. Henry Lee and his team of Americans had previously established the belly wound was in fact a gunshot wound, and then claimed the windshield hole had been struck from the outside based on the lack of windshield powder outside the jeep. Despite widespread speculation that the casings were planted on the street, Lee expressed no concern regarding the origin of the evidence even though the casings had been found some 3½ hours after the incident occurred and street cleaning had <b>cleaned</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> firecracker debris. Dr. Lee was also not critical of the local police and National Security Bureau's inability to secure the scene of the incident afterwards until the casings were found.|$|E
