500|$|The novel {{opens in}} 1954 {{in the small}} logging {{settlement}} of Twisted River on the Androscoggin River in northern New Hampshire. A log driving accident on the river has just claimed {{the life of a}} young logger, Angel, who slipped and fell under the logs. Dominic Baciagalupo is the camp's Italian-American cook who lives above the kitchen with his 12-year-old son, Daniel. Dominic lost his wife, Rosie, 10 years previously when a drunk Dominic, Rosie and a logger and mutual friend, Ketchum, were dancing on the frozen river, and the ice broke and Rosie went under. Later another accident happens that changes the lives of Dominic, Daniel and Ketchum. [...] "Injun Jane", the kitchen's dishwasher and girlfriend of the local law officer, Constable Carl, is having an affair with Dominic. One night, mistaking her for a bear attacking his father, Daniel kills her with an eight-inch <b>cast-iron</b> <b>skillet.</b> Dominic takes Jane's body and deposits it on the kitchen floor of Carl's house, knowing that Carl will be passed out drunk and will probably believe he killed her, as he often beat her up. Early the next morning Dominic and Daniel tell Ketchum what happened and flee Twisted River in case the bad-tempered Carl finds out what really happened.|$|E

50|$|In 1993, Maria Weaver filed a {{restraining}} order against her husband, and their marriage ended in divorce. In July 1995, Weaver beat his new girlfriend, Kristi Sloan, with a <b>cast-iron</b> <b>skillet.</b> He was jailed for the incident, but Sloan refused to testify against him. By October they were back together and, in February 1996, they married. The marriage lasted four years.|$|E
5000|$|Cast iron's {{ability to}} {{withstand}} and maintain very high cooking temperatures {{makes it a}} common choice for searing or frying, and its excellent heat retention makes it a good option for long-cooking stews or braised dishes. Because <b>cast-iron</b> <b>skillets</b> can develop a [...] "non-stick" [...] surface, they are also {{a good choice for}} egg dishes. Other uses of cast-iron pans include baking, for instance for making cornbread, cobblers and cakes.|$|R
50|$|Blackening is {{a cooking}} {{technique}} {{used in the}} preparation of fish and other foods. Often associated with Cajun cuisine, this technique was popularized by chef Paul Prudhomme. The food is dipped in melted butter and then dredged in a mixture of herbs and spices, usually some combination of thyme, oregano, chili pepper, peppercorns, salt, garlic powder and onion powder. It is then cooked in a very hot <b>cast-iron</b> <b>skillet.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary {{factor that}} distinguishes Maryland fried chicken from other Southern fried chicken is {{that rather than}} cooking the chicken in several inches of oil or shortening, the chicken is pan-fried in a heavy (traditionally <b>cast-iron)</b> <b>skillet</b> and covered tightly after the initial {{browning}} so that the chicken steams as well as fries. Milk or cream is then added to the pan juices to create a white cream gravy, another Maryland characteristic.|$|E
5000|$|The beans {{may also}} be roasted on the stove top. One classic method is to use open-top {{cookware}} such as a <b>cast-iron</b> <b>skillet,</b> a frying pan, or a wok, the beans constantly stirred to obtain an even degree of roasting. Another option {{is to use a}} stove-top popcorn maker such as a [...] "Whirley Pop" [...] or similar device with an integral crank and internal agitator system to keep the beans in motion as they roast. Constant cranking or stirring is required, as is plenty of ventilation.|$|E
50|$|A {{music video}} for the song, {{directed}} by Ryan Reichenfeld, {{was released on}} October 29, 2013. Timberlake's love interest in the video is played by Elvis Presley's granddaughter Riley Keough, with the video lasting for 7 minutes. The video was written by Timberlake and director Ryan Reichenfeld, and it splices scenes from a cushy loft—where Timberlake and Keough engage in various adult activities—and a not-too-distant future where the singer is roped behind a moving truck driven on a dusty road by his lady. In another scene, Keough delivers a <b>cast-iron</b> <b>skillet</b> to Timberlake's cranium. Through it all, Timberlake keeps his chin up and continues to sing even while being dragged to his death.|$|E
50|$|Cornbread is {{made from}} cornmeal and can differ {{significantly}} in taste and texture from region to region. In general, the South prefers white cornmeal with little to no wheat flour or sweeteners added; it is traditionally baked in a <b>cast-iron</b> <b>skillet</b> and ideally has a crunchy outside and moist inside. The North usually prefers yellow cornmeal with sometimes {{as much as half}} wheat flour in its composition, as well as sugar, honey, or maple syrup. This results in a bread that is softer and sweeter than its southern counterpart. Wheat flour was not available to the average North American family until the early 1900s when a new breed of wheat termed Marquis was produced. This was a hybrid of Red Fife and Hard red winter wheat. Marquis grew well and soon average Americans were able to have homemade wheat bread on the table. Homemade wheat breads are made in a rectangular tin similar to those in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|Most bare {{cast-iron}} {{pots and}} pans are cast as {{a single piece of}} metal, including the handle. This allows them to be used on both the stovetop and in the oven. Many recipes call for the use of a <b>cast-iron</b> <b>skillet</b> or pot, especially so that the dish can be initially seared or fried on the stovetop then transferred into the oven, pan and all, to finish baking. Likewise, cast-iron skillets can double as baking dishes. Cornbread in particular is seen as a food item that is best prepared in a cast-iron skillet: the iron pan is heated beforehand in the oven, the ingredients are first combined and mixed in a mixing bowl, then added to the heated pan, and the dish is then placed directly into the oven for fast baking. This differs from many other cooking pots, which have varying components that may be damaged by the excessive temperatures of [...] or more.|$|E
50|$|Bare {{cast-iron}} vessels {{have been}} used for cooking for over two thousand years. Cast-iron cauldrons and cooking pots were valued as kitchen items for their durability and their ability to retain heat, thus improving the quality of cooking meals. In Europe, before the introduction of the kitchen stove {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, meals were cooked in the hearth or fireplace, and cooking pots and pans were designed for use in the hearth. This meant that all cooking vessels had to be designed to be suspended on, or in, a fireplace. Cast-iron pots were made with handles to allow them to be hung over a fire, or with legs so that they could stand up in the fireplace. In addition to Dutch ovens, which were developed with the onset of the Industrial Revolution, a commonly used cast-iron cooking pan called a spider had a handle and three legs used to stand up in the coals and ashes of the fire. Cooking pots and pans with legless, flat bottoms were designed when cooking stoves became popular; this period of the late 19th century saw the introduction of the flat <b>cast-iron</b> <b>skillet.</b>|$|E
