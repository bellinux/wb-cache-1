5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} two axles, were {{attached}} to the steel <b>crossbeam.</b> The aluminium body was attached to the <b>crossbeam</b> with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the axle box via a revolute joint and a spiral spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E
5|$|Camping for {{the night}} on a riverbank, Andrei and Foma are {{collecting}} firewood for their group when Andrei hears the distant sounds of celebration further upstream in the woods. Going to investigate he encounters {{a large group of}} naked pagans, who are conducting a torch lit ritual for Midsummer. Andrei is intrigued and excited by the behaviour of the pagans but is caught spying on a couple making love, is tied to the <b>crossbeam</b> of a hut in a mockery of Jesus' crucifixion and is threatened with drowning in the morning. A woman named Marfa (Nelly Snegina), dressed only in a fur coat approaches Andrei. After explaining that her people are persecuted for their beliefs she drops her coat, kisses Andrei and then unties him. Andrei runs away, and is lost in the dense woods, scratching his face. The next morning Andrei returns to his group, including Daniil, and as they leave on their boats a group of soldiers appear on the riverbank chasing after several of the pagans including Marfa. Her partner is captured but she makes her naked escape by swimming into the river past Andrei’s boat. He and his fellow monks look away in shame.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, the {{condemned}} {{was forced to}} carry the <b>crossbeam</b> {{to the place of}} execution. A whole cross would weigh well over 135kg (300lb), but the <b>crossbeam</b> would not be quite as burdensome, weighing around 45kg (100lb). The Roman historian Tacitus records that the city of Rome had a specific place for carrying out executions, situated outside the Esquiline Gate, and had a specific area reserved for the execution of slaves by crucifixion. Upright posts would presumably be fixed permanently in that place, and the <b>crossbeam,</b> with {{the condemned}} person perhaps already nailed to it, would then be attached to the post.|$|E

The method of finite element in software ANSYS was used for the creation of composite sample calculation model as well as in calculation of sample loads. The results of the thesis are the values of the sample reaction force and of the first main tension on <b>crossbeams</b> of foam core sample obtained by loading of the foam composite sample. The area of breaches <b>crossbeams</b> was inferred from the analysis of composite core structure breach. In conclusion were evaluated the results obtained in this thesis...|$|R

50|$|The {{steamboat}} Comet, {{whose name}} {{was said to have}} been “misleading”, was built in Seattle in 1871 by Capt. Simon F. Randolph (d.1909). Comet was constructed in an unusual fashion. Randolph built the vessel upside down by picking a flat area of ground, marking out the shape of the boat on the ground, and driving in posts at regular intervals to act as ribs. He then connected the ribs with <b>crossbeams,</b> bent planks around the posts and over the <b>crossbeams,</b> and had the hull complete, although upside down.|$|R

50|$|Once {{the arch}} was completed, the creeper cranes were then worked {{back down the}} arches, {{allowing}} the roadway {{and other parts of}} the bridge to be constructed from the centre out. The vertical hangers were attached to the arch, and these were then joined with horizontal <b>crossbeams.</b> The deck for the roadway and railway were built on top of the <b>crossbeams,</b> with the deck itself being completed by June 1931, and the creeper cranes were dismantled. Rails for trains and trams were laid, and road was surfaced using concrete topped with asphalt. Power and telephone lines, and water, gas, and drainage pipes were also all added to the bridge in 1931.|$|R
25|$|The first bridges made {{by humans}} were {{probably}} spans of cut wooden logs or planks and eventually stones, using a simple support and <b>crossbeam</b> arrangement. A {{common form of}} lashing sticks, logs, and deciduous branches together involved the use of long reeds or other harvested fibers woven {{together to form a}} huge rope capable of binding and holding together the materials used in early bridges.|$|E
25|$|The authors {{say there}} were two {{possible}} ways of erecting the stauros, which {{would probably have been}} not much higher than the height of a man. The condemned man could be fastened to the cross lying on the ground at the place of execution, then lifted up on it. Alternatively, it was probably usual to have the stake implanted in the ground before the execution. The victim was tied to the crosspiece and was hoisted up with the horizontal beam and made fast to the vertical stake. They say that as this was the simpler form of erection, and the carrying of the <b>crossbeam</b> (patibulum) was probably a form of punishment for slaves, the crux commissa may be taken as the normal practice.|$|E
25|$|In larger {{operations}} such as Jubilee, Torch, Husky, and Overlord, LCAs {{were carried}} to invasion areas by Landing Ship Infantry (LSI). The location {{chosen for the}} LSI to stop and lower the LCA was a designated point inside the 'Transport Area' when the LSI was operating with a US Navy Task Force, or the 'Lowering Position' when with a Royal Navy Task Force. The transport area or lowering position was approximately 6–11 miles off shore (11 miles was amphibious doctrine for the USN by mid-war, while the RN tended to accept {{the risks associated with}} drawing nearer shore). Normally landing ships were fitted with heavy-duty power-operated davits. Early landing ships were fitted with Welin-McLachlin davits – these being generally in use in the Merchant Navy for standard 99 man lifeboats. As the weight of LCAs increased through the war (eventually approaching 14 tons) heavier davits were required. Later LSIs and those being refitted were provisioned with luffing davits of a <b>crossbeam</b> type. The davits themselves provided a demarcation between the responsibilities of the LSI crew (either Royal Navy or Merchant Navy) {{and the members of the}} LCA Flotilla.|$|E

Since at least the Western Zhou Dynasty (c. 1050–771 BC), they were placed between {{the top of a}} column and a <b>crossbeam</b> to support the concave roofs of beam-in-tier buildings which were archetypal of Chinese architecture. Each dougong is formed by double bow-shaped arms (拱, gong) supported by a wooden block (斗, dou) on each side. Dougong were also used for decorative and ceremonial rather than entirely pragmatic purposes of support, such as on solid brick pagodas like the Iron Pagoda built in 1049.

500|$|Cragh was hanged {{on a hill}} about {{a quarter}} of a mile (400 m) outside Swansea, in sight of de Briouze's Swansea Castle, on Monday 27 November 1290. He was {{executed}} along with another [...] "malefactor", Trahaern ap Hywel. Although the latter was dealt with by the town executioner, Cragh was hanged by one of his own relatives, Ythel Fachan, who was forced into that service by de Briouze. Trahaern ap Hywel was a large and powerful man who struggled a great deal as he was hauled up from the ground by his neck, causing the <b>crossbeam</b> of the gallows to break. Although the executioner, John of Baggeham, considered both men to be already dead when they fell to the ground they were nevertheless hanged again, [...] "as an insult to their kin", and because it was the usual custom that hanged men could not be removed from the gallows without the lord's permission. The execution took place early in the morning, and the two men were left swinging from the gallows. John of Baggeham reported that he cut down Cragh's body at about 4:00pm and sent it into the town at the request of William de Briouze's wife, Lady Mary. It is unclear what became of Trahaern ap Hywel, but his body may have been buried by the gallows.|$|E

50|$|The {{design is}} based on two {{separate}} roadways which are connected by <b>crossbeams.</b> A symphony bridge would have two pylons, which would be circular in hollow cross-section. The center of the bridge would be supported by a central cable (unlike the conventional two side cables of a suspension bridge) connected to the deck via hangers connected to the <b>crossbeams.</b> The cross-beams and hangers are triangular in form. On {{both sides of the}} suspension section, the bridge would be built as a cable-stayed bridge with cables from the pylon. The areas closest to the pylons would be constructed with cantilever support. The designers have stated that the bridge would allow for greater wind stability, more drag, faster construction time, lower cost, and increased access for inspections and maintenance.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the design of}} timber {{footbridge}} across river Sava Bohinjka near Bohinjska Bistrica is presented. In the introduction the historical description {{of the development of}} the timber bridges is done, followed by description of the footbridge and its location. Afterwards, materials used on the construction and their material properties are presented. Action on footbridge and their combinations are written in accordance with Eurocod standards. An optimization of the ratio of spans is made to unify bending moments across main beams. Statical and modal analysis is made with computer program Tower 6 to get internal forces of construction, which are used to design sections of main constructional elements and joints between them. The construction contains of two parallel glued laminated timber beams which are straight at endings and curved with radius 180 m in the middle. Glued laminated timber beams are made from timber GL 28 h and are connected with cross-beams made from D 60 quality timber. On the top of <b>crossbeams,</b> secondary longitudinal beams made from glued laminated Gl 28 h timber are laid. Secondary <b>crossbeams</b> made from D 60 quality timber are laid on secondary longitudinal beams. Horizontal stiffness is provided with steel truss located between the <b>crossbeams.</b> All constructional elements are connected with steel plates and different fasteners...|$|R
