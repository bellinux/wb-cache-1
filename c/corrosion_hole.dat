In many cases, the location of a leak can be determined by seeing material drip out at a certain place, although the leak opening itself is not obvious. In some cases, it may known or suspected there is a leak, but even the location of the leak is not known. Since leak openings are often so irregular, leaks are sometimes sized by the leakage rate, as in volume of fluid leaked per time, rather than the size of the opening.|$|E
40|$|Carbon steel {{cantilever}} beams {{are widely}} used in many applications in aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering. Pitting corrosion is a phenomenon which places severe limitations {{on the design of}} such applications. As such, understanding this phenomenon and the methods to deal with it, are of a great importance. This paper presents numerical investigation by using F. E. (Finite Element) simulation on the load carrying capacity of corroded cantilever beams with pitting corrosion damage. The pitting <b>corrosion</b> <b>hole</b> shape has been modeled using ASTM G 46 Standard Guide. Several different cases of pitting corrosion, represented by hemispherical holes, were modeled and examined by using ANSYS computer program. Clamped edge constraint was used on one end, while the other end was free. In these F. E. models, element of Solid 95 was used and comparison to Bernoulli-Euler theory was made. The effect of the radius of the pitting corrosion holes on the stresses in the beam was examined in comparison to yield stress. It has been found that the M. S. (Margin of Safety) has been reduced gradually with increasing radii. Agreement with Bernoulli-Euler theory has been achieved only for small radii. Moreover, three methods of pitting corrosion repairs were examined, together with Bernoulli-Euler theory comparison: 1) Regular surface repair; 2) Extension surface repair; and 3) “ Handy Removal ”. It was found that extension surface repair has the highest M. S. value. </p...|$|E

Items investigated were {{the thickness of}} shell and deck plates, local and overall deformation of the hull, the wear of rivet heads and mechanical and other proper-ties of steel plates of decks and hull. The characteristics of old plates investigated were chemical compositions, static and dynamic tensile strength, fracture toughness and fatigue strength. Thick-ness distribution of old plates with worn out holes due to corrosion were also measured, Based {{on the results of}} investigations, the seaworthiness of K-maw was discussed, Results obtained were as follows; 1. The plate thickness reduction rate by corrosion of deck and shell plates at midship was about 5 % in spite of her old age, though there existed some deep corroded parts in them. 2. The 5 % of the whole hull deterioration rate corresponded to about 0. 6 % <b>corrosion</b> <b>hole</b> area ratio of the whole hulL 3. A small amount of deformation of the ship hull as a w~hole was responsible for the long term service and repeated repairs by weld-ing. 4. The original old steel plates of 56 years showed good tensile strength, but poor weldabifity and fracture toughness. 5. Very rough surfaces of steel plates due to corrosion largely di-minished their fatigue lives, because of decrease in thickness and stress concentration by surface roughness. 6.

This is due to changes in the device-tissue interface, mostly in the form of device degradation and macrophage/microglia encapsulation. A novel material for neural interfaces, glassy carbon (GC) provides tunable stiffness and impedance, reducing mechanical strain on brain tissue and offering optimized charge injection capabilities. GC is often used in electrochemical reactions due to its high stability and resistance to <b>corrosion.</b> <b>Holes</b> were also integrated into the design to allow astrocytes to form around the device, securing it in place for stable recording locations. We present results from in-vivo testing of a fully customized neural device made of GC μECoG electrodes and metal traces, supported on a flexible, polyimide substrate. The devices were integrated into a custom PCB using a low profile connector. They were then implanted subdurally into the brains of rats. During implant, complex impedance was measured multiple times weekly as an indicator of changes in the tissue-device interface. Stimulation effectiveness was determined by testing for evoked potentials. Animals were implanted with electrodes for 5 - 6 weeks, after which the animals were sacrificed for histological analysis.

However, chemical agents may potentially damage metal components of orthodontic appliances. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of three mouthwashes on the surface characteristics of nickel–titanium (NiTi) and Stainless steel (SS) arch wires. Methods and Materials: 15 pieces of 0. 016 inch NiTi and 15 pieces of 0. 016 -inch SS wires were randomly assigned into 5 groups including 2 controls (as- received and artificial saliva) and 3 experimental groups. The samples in all groups were stored in artificial saliva in an incubator at 37 ˚C for one month, after that, the test groups were immersed in Chlorhexidine 0. 12 %, Hydrogen peroxide 0. 12 % and Persica mouth washes for 30 min, 1. 5 h and 1. 5 h, respectively. Then, the samples were washed by distilled water and returned to artificial saliva for more than two months. Surface topography changes and the number of <b>corrosion</b> <b>holes</b> were characterized via a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Two way ANOVA and Tukey tests were used to compare groups.

The conduction band (- 1. 05 V(SCE)) is located below that of TiO(2), more negative than the HCrO(4) (-) /Cr(3 +) level (+ 0. 58 V(SCE)) yielding a thermodynamically feasible chromate reduction upon visible illumination.

The Fengfeng formation are composed of carbonate, evaporites and secondary breccia, which {{can be divided into}} 17 rock microfacies. The lithology of Fengfeng formation can be divided into two segments, the lithology of lower segment is mostly dolomite and anhydrite rocks, which was formed in dolomitic flat and gypsum-halite lake of supratidal; and the upper segment is micrite-grain limestone, which was formed in open platform. Fengfeng formation experienced a complex transformation of diagenesis, the main types of <b>hole</b> are <b>corrosion</b> pore, microporous between crystalline, structure cracks and corrosion cracks. Pressured-mercury tests show that the pore structure is mainly microporous, and lower segment is more developed than the upper segment. The results of the stress-strain experiment show that Fengfeng formation has low permeability, which is belonged to weak-impermeable scope of the permeability. The permeability of the upper segment is 5 ∼ 10 times to the lower segment.

40|$|Abstract: In Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC) testing, the {{response}} feature of one-dimensional magnetic field component, {{perpendicular to the}} conductor’s surface, is used to detect and quantify the defects. It is not sufficient for signal interpretation and noise suppression. A novel PEC probe, which consists of a tangential driver-coil and three orthorhombic pickup coils, is introduced in this paper. It is greatly advantageous to realize three dimensional field components measurement independently. Moreover it is characteristic of self-difference and lower lift-off noise. Using Finite Element Method (FEM), three dimensional magnetic flux density responses due to a defect in conductor plate, have been calculated. The result shows that a defect’s depth and edges can be evaluated quantitatively by extracting three dimensional field components responses features. Numerical predication is in good agreement with experimental measurement. These merits are valuable for imaging inspection of defects (such as <b>corrosion,</b> dent, rivet <b>hole,</b> etc) in the aircraft structures.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with synthetic aperture focusing of ultrasonic pulse-echo measurements, with application to multilayered media and cylindrical structures. The work is motivated by the need for accurate methods for non-destructive testing of pipelines, particularly water distribution pipelines. By improving the lateral resolution in ultrasonic measurements, the synthetic aperture algorithms presented in the thesis enable accurate detection and sizing of <b>corrosion</b> damage, <b>holes,</b> and other pipe defects. In ultrasonic inspection of water-filled pipelines, {{the water and the}} pipe wall constitute a multilayered structure, and multilayer synthetic aperture algorithms are therefore needed. We present a number of such multilayer algorithms, formulated in both the time and Fourier domains, and show that the Fourier-domain algorithms generally require a significantly lower processing time. An algorithm combining two algorithms used in reflection seismology is shown to require the least processing time for large data sets. When the synthetic aperture is created by scanning over a straight line or a flat plane, and the propagating medium is homogeneous, the lateral resolution after focusing is approximately half the transducer diameter. We show that this resolution limit also applies in the multilayer case, for both two- and three-dimensional imaging, as long as the transducer beam is relatively narrow. Ultrasonic measurements for pipe inspection are usually performed over a cylindrical surface. We develop a new synthetic aperture algorithm, termed cylindrical phase shift migration, to focus such scans. The algorithm is applicable to concentrically layered media, and thus enables full volumetric synthetic aperture imaging in pipes and similar structures. It is shown that the lateral resolution along the cylinder axis is approximately half the transducer diameter, and that the angular resolution is approximately D/(2 R), where D denotes transducer diameter and R denotes scan radius. The algorithm is also adapted for use with focused transducers, and it is shown that it significantly extends the range within which the transducer yields a high lateral resolution...|$|R

Weak points in the system can create implosion or explosion hazards. To ensure safe working conditions, use the universal work practices outlined below. Use Appropriate Tubing and Equipment Always use tubing (metal, thick walled rubber, etc.) that is rated for the appropriate pressure or vacuum conditions you will be using. Use tubing that is in good condition and free of cracks, <b>holes,</b> <b>corrosion</b> or other signs of degradation. Don’t use glassware that is thin, scratched or star-cracked. Avoid using round bottom flasks over 1000 mL in volume or glassware/equipment that is not approved for vacuum work. Check Your Connections Connections (ball joint, ground glass, etc.) between tubing and apparatus require clamping (keck, hose, pinch, etc.) to ensure system integrity. Make sure all connections are properly greased, lubricated or sealed. Vacuum trap with connections clamped (arrows). Trap inserted into dewar flask (with polyethylene netting) with lid covered (towel). Secure Traps Make sure to properly secure all traps and dewar flasks to avoid unnecessary movement that can cause glass breakage. Use Appropriate Sized Traps Always use appropriate sized traps when evaporating substances. Don’t use a small volume trap if the displaced material is of large volume. Use Iced Traps As Appropriate Always properly use iced traps to at least- 60 o C when operating a vacuum system. Cooling systems can be electrically refrigerated systems, liquid Nitrogen (see WARNING below) or traditional dry ice with isopropanol (- 78 o C). Dewar flasks (after trap insertion) must be full or more with coolant.
