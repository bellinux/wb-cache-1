5|$|The {{songs and}} musical score {{used in the}} film were {{composed}} and written by Carlo Savina and Gilbert Kaplan. The songs were sung by Kaplan and Ann Collin. The music resembles Riz Ortolani's score from Africa addio, as most tracks are of a light and upbeat nature, particularly during the opening and <b>closing</b> <b>credits.</b> The arrangement of music to enhance atmosphere and create comic effect also mimics the compositions in Africa addio.|$|E
5|$|The various {{philosophical}} {{theories in}} the early Upanishads {{have been attributed to}} famous sages such as Yajnavalkya, Uddalaka Aruni, Shvetaketu, Shandilya, Aitareya, Balaki, Pippalada, and Sanatkumara. Women, such as Maitreyi and Gargi participate in the dialogues and are also credited {{in the early}} Upanishads.There are some exceptions to the anonymous tradition of the Upanishads. The Shvetashvatara Upanishad, for example, includes <b>closing</b> <b>credits</b> to sage Shvetashvatara, and he is considered the author of the Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{intermediate}} (DI) {{was conducted}} at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad. A high-end DI system was imported and the process took six months to complete. Singer Chinmayi, who dubbed for Samantha in Eega, found the process difficult because the footage did not contain the animated fly. Rajamouli approached Anuj Gurwara to write the dialogue for the Hindi-dubbed version titled Makkhi. The Hindi dubbing began in Hyderabad, and Gurwara dubbed for Nani in the film. Ajay Devgan and his wife Kajol, acting as parents telling the film's story to their child at bedtime, provided voiceovers during the opening credits of Makkhi. The visuals accompanying the <b>closing</b> <b>credits</b> were altered to show the fly mimicking the antics of Devgan, Salman Khan, and Akshay Kumar.|$|E
50|$|A brief {{epilogue}} featuring news {{footage from}} anti-Koch protests {{around the country}} calls for unity in exposing the Koch brothers. As in previous Brave New Films documentaries footage over the <b>closing</b> <b>credit</b> shows members of the production team unsuccessfully attempting to contact the Koch Brothers for comment on the film and the issues raised.|$|R
50|$|The {{epilogue}} verse 6.21 is a {{homage to}} sage Shvetashvatara for proclaiming Brahman-knowledge to ascetics. This <b>closing</b> <b>credit</b> is structurally notable {{because of its}} rarity in ancient Indian texts, {{as well as for}} its implication that the four-stage Ashrama system of Hinduism, with ascetic Sannyasa, was an established tradition by the time verse 6.21 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad was composed.|$|R
5000|$|During the series, Moore acted—officially and practically—as his own {{wardrobe}} stylist. It {{stemmed from}} genuine sartorial interests {{and because he}} was marketing a line of clothes by bespoke men's tailors, Pearson and Foster. Every episode carried the <b>closing</b> <b>credit,</b> [...] "Lord Sinclair's clothes designed by Roger Moore", with [...] "Roger Moore" [...] written as a large signature.|$|R
5|$|Mike B. Anderson {{stated that}} at least three {{different}} acts of material were written and animated for Krusty's comeback stand-up appearance at Moe's Tavern. It {{was not until the}} editing process that the material used was decided upon. The episode was still being animated three weeks before it was due to air and the production process moved frantically shortly before completion. The Canyonero sequence was originally planned to be displayed during the <b>closing</b> <b>credits.</b> The production team liked the scene so much that they did not want it to be obscured by the credits and gave it its own segment {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} a primary {{theme of the}} film score for The Boy with Green Hair (1948), for which the {{original}} version was used. The producers of the film reportedly paid $10,000 to ahbez for using the song, which was cumulatively more than what {{the author of the}} story, Betsy Beaton, was paid. A recording by Kate Ceberano was featured in the film The Crossing (1990). The tune and lyrics feature prominently in the film Untamed Heart (1993), for which Cole's version was used during the <b>closing</b> <b>credits,</b> while a piano version by Roger Williams served as the opener for the film. The song was also played in intermediate scenes featuring the principal cast.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Jeunet {{included}} an alternate {{version of the}} film on the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set with different opening and <b>closing</b> <b>credits,</b> which were originally cut due to budget restrictions. The deleted scenes included references to the character Newt from Aliens, Vriess making a joke to Call, Ripley's clone {{waking up in the}} middle of her operation, an extended conversation in the mess hall that reveals the details of Ripley's former employers, Weyland-Yutani, an extended dialogue between Call and Ripley's clone in the chapel and scenes of the Betty landing on Earth and the planet's landscape during the final dialogue between Ripley and Call, as they view the ruins of Paris. The special edition restores 13 minutes and 5 seconds worth of footage (including the new opening and ending), and is 7 minutes longer than theatrical version. Jeunet has stated that the special edition is not a director's cut as his preferred version is the theatrical cut.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is known}} that the program is tagged [...] "Copyright 2010/National Sports Programming/All Rights Reserved" [...] in the <b>closing</b> <b>credit,</b> with no mention of Fox or FSN.

The channels that air this program {{have a variety of}} owners: News Corporation, Comcast, DirecTV Sports Networks, and Cablevision.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the host}} has {{announced}} the teams' final scores, {{the studio audience}} is invited down from the stands to join the contestants on camera during the <b>closing</b> <b>credit</b> sequence.

50|$|D Train {{sang the}} {{original}} “Pokérap”, the official <b>closing</b> <b>credit</b> theme {{song for the}} anime Pokémon in 1999. The song also appeared on the show’s official soundtrack. That same year, D Train provided backing vocals on the song “Eyes of a Child”, written by Trey Parker and performed by Michael McDonald for the film “South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut”.|$|R
