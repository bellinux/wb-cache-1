40|$|This Diploma-Thesis {{was made}} within the GERDA-Experiment. GERDAs {{aim is to}} detect the neutrinoless double beta decay of 76 Ge. Its {{detection}} would prove that neutrinos are Majorana particles. GERDA is still under construction, data acquisition will start in 2008. If neutrinoless double beta events are detected, than we have the half life of double beta decay and the effective neutrino mass. If no double beta event is detected than we have an new lower limit of the half life of the double beta decay (T 1 / 2 > 2 1026 a) und a new upper limit for the effective neutrino mass (mee= 0, 09 - 0, 29 eV). The assumption to find such a rare neutrinoless double beta decay {{is to reduce the}} background by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude below the current state-of-the-art. A part of the background originates from cosmic rays, this is way GERDA is built underground in the Gran Sasso laboratory. An another part comes from radioactive isotops contained in the building materials, e. g. 226 Ra which decays to 222 Rn. All used gases in GERDA like nitrogen and argon contain radon. My task at the MPIK in Heidelberg was to test and develop a new Lucas cell. Lucas cells are radon detectors which offer the opportunity of online-monitoring of radon in gas. This new lucas cell should be used in GERDA for radon-monitoring in air or gases like nitrogen (argon) in clean rooms and <b>clean</b> <b>benches,</b> because the atmosphere should content low radon (e. g. to minimize the contamination of the germanium crystalls). Because of the high purity standarts for GERDA, a Lucas cell with a much better sensitivity compared to normally used ones should be constructed.

First, a laboratory sample rotator is designed and demonstrated {{that can be used}} for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, <b>benches,</b> <b>clean</b> hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a laboratory sample shaker. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$ 30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $ 20 more.

Before sampling, the filter papers were dried for 3 hrs in an oven at 105 °C to remove moisture, if any, and to get constant weight. After drying, the filter papers were kept in a desiccator at room temperature. For weighing of sample Mettler Toledo make balance model AX 204 capacity 220 g has been used.

40|$|Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), {{located on}} Kirkland Air Force Base (KAFB) in Albuquerque, NM, is {{implementing}} a comprehensive water conservation program. Because the average rainfall in this metropolitan area of 500, 000 is approximately 8 inches per year, conservation of this precious resource {{is critical to}} the economic health of the city and state, and the continued operations at SNL/NM. To address this need, SNL/NM is taking a systematic, comprehensive approach to water conservation. The approach is to estimate the water consumption for all of SNL/NM by type of consumption. For each type of water consumption, all cost effective measures for reducing, reclaiming, and/or recycling that usage will be ranked. These water conservation measures range from the simple such as retrofitting plumbing fixtures with low cost devices to reduce water required to flush toilets to the very complex.

40|$|A premium college {{football}} player {{is estimated to}} generate over $ 1 million for his program, so optimal player assessment and selection are paramount. Lean body mass, back squat, and vertical jump {{have been the most}} predictive physical test scores, but such metrics typically account for less than 10 % of variance in football performance. NFL scouts have tended to rely on vertical jump, 40 -yard dash, and 20 -yard shuttle scores, but interestingly, reliance on none of the physical tests conducted at the NFL Combine was predictive of team success; in fact, teams that relied on fewer total physical test scores tended to win more games. Dr. Tom Osborne suggested the Performance Index for interpreting physical performance metrics, but also insisted that psychological attributes such as toughness were equally important to his evaluation process since players deal with immense adversity {{during the course of a}} season. Toughness can be characterized as the ability to cope with stressors more effectively, and is measured in this study by examining cortisol reactivity. When physical test scores (i. e., lean body mass, hang <b>clean,</b> back squat, <b>bench</b> press, 10 -yard dash, 20 -yard shuttle, and vertical jump) were converted into Performance Index scores among 47 Division 1 freshman football players, players who contributed on the field differed from players who did not contribute only in vertical jump and 10 -yard dash scores. A multiple regression model that included only physical test scores accounted for 28 % of variance in football performance, whereas a model that included cortisol reactivity measured during a physical testing session, in addition to traditional physical performance prediction metrics, accounted for 39 % of variance. Results from this investigation suggest that cortisol reactivity may capture a distinctive attribute of players and predict on-field performance better than many individual physical performance variables. If cortisol reactivity, as a measure of toughness, can be effectively used to predict performance on the football field, then the metric should be included in performance prediction models that have traditionally included only physical attributes of players. ...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{relationship}} between weight room exercises and various rowing performance measures is limited; this information would prove useful for sport-specific assessment of individual needs and exercise prescription. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish strength, power, and muscular endurance exercises for weight room training, which are strong determinants of success in specific performance measures used to assess elite rowers. Nineteen heavyweight elite males determined their repetition maximum (RM) loads for exercises using a Concept 2 DYNO [5, 30, 60 and 120 RM leg pressing and seated arm pulling (in Joules) ] and free weights [1 RM power clean (in kilograms) and 6 RM bench pull (in kilograms and watts) ]. Rowing performance measures included a 7 -stage blood lactate response ergometer test (aerobic condition), time trials (500, 2000, and 5000 m), a peak stroke power test, and a 60 -minute distance trial. Pearson correlation moments (r + 0. 7) and stepwise multiple linear regression calculations (R 2 + 50 %) were used to establish strong common variances between weight room exercises and rowing ergometer performance (p # 0. 05). Weight room exercises were strong predictors of 2000 -m, 500 -m time (in seconds), and peak stroke power performance measures only. Bench pull power (in watts) and 1 RM power clean (in kilograms) were the best 2 -factor predictors of peak stroke power (R 2 = 73 %; standard error of the estimates [SEE] = 59. 6 W) and 500 m (R 2 = 70 %; SEE = 1. 75 seconds); while 5 RM leg pressing (in Joules) and either 6 RM bench pull (kg) or 60 RM seated arm pulling (in Joules) the best predictors of 2000 m (R 2 = 59 %; SEE = 6. 3 seconds and R 2 = 57 %; SEE = 6. 4 seconds, respectively).

30|$|Although cells {{generally}} do not adhere to the PDMS membrane which is made of a 10 : 1 (ratio of base to the curing agent) PDMS [13], the adhesion between PDMS and cells changes when the hyperelastic PDMS membrane which has different mechanical properties is used [17]. Thus, seeded cells will not form a 3 D construct, {{and it will be}} difficult to recover the cellular construct from the scaffold. In our experiment, the prior coating of MPC polymer on the PDMS actuators helps preventing cells from adhering to them.

Ethanol, xylose, xylitol, glucose, mannose, fructose, cellobiose and maltose concentrations in the culture filtrates were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Shimadzu Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a refractive index detector RID- 10 A and a Shodex KS- 801 or SP 0810 column (8.0  mm[*]×[*] 300  mm; Showa Denko Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The HPLC system was operated at 80 °C using a distilled water mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6  ml/min. The composition of wheat bran and rice straw were analyzed using the NREL Laboratory Analytical Procedures (Sluiter et al. 2008). Reducing sugars liberated during the fermentation were measured using the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method (Miller 1959). The concentrations of starch and glucose in the culture filtrates during fermentation on corn starch and wheat bran were determined using an F-kit for starch (Roche Diagnostics, Manheim, Germany) and Glucose C 2 test kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), respectively. The theoretical yield of ethanol was defined as 0.51  g ethanol per 1  g glucose (2  mol of ethanol per 1  mol of glucose) or 0.51  g ethanol per 1  g xylose (1.67  mol of ethanol per 1  mol of xylose).|$|E
