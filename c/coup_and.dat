In 1937, Archbishop of Kraków, Adam Stefan Sapieha, ordered to move Piłsudski's coffin from St. Leonard's Crypt to Royal Tombs at Wawel. This led to open conflict with {{the church and the}} government, which threatened to step down.|$|E

Kantakouzenos returned to Constantinople in early September, where he stayed {{for a few weeks}} consulting with the Empress. On his way back to Thrace to prepare for a campaign into the Morea, he went to Epibatai, where he pardoned Apokaukos and restored him to his former offices.|$|E

There was no disruption to road traffic or the media, and although flights were halted in the morning, they resumed in the afternoon. There were plans to enact a curfew but this was abandoned.|$|E

In addition, Albert T. White, Commanding Officer of the LNG, was 'rusticated' by Tubman to become the Superindendent of Grand Gedeh in 1966, though he was later 'rehabilitated'.|$|E

Fighting {{took place in the}} heart of Addis Ababa, shells detonated in the Jubilee Palace, and many of those closest to the emperor were killed. Although Abebe was not directly involved, he was briefly arrested and questioned. Mengistu was later hanged, and his forces (which included many members of the Imperial Guard) were killed in the fighting, arrested or fled.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 29/30 September 1962, {{military}} commanders in South Kasai, led by Kankolongo, led a coup d'état in Bakwanga against the Kalonjist regime. The coup d'état was followed by calls for South Kasai to be fully re-integrated into the Congo. On 5 October 1962, central government troops again arrived in Bakwanga to support the mutineers and help suppress the last Kalonjist loyalists, marking {{the end of the}} secession. Kalonji himself escaped capture during the <b>coup</b> <b>and</b> fled into exile in Barcelona in Francisco Franco's Spain. General Dinanga also fled.|$|E

5|$|The {{trial of}} those charged with {{involvement}} in the coup occurred {{more than two years}} later in mid-1963.

Nineteen officers and 34 civilians were accused of complicity in the <b>coup</b> <b>and</b> called before the Special Military Court.|$|E

5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon for}} bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted <b>coup</b> <b>and</b> the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E
5|$|Amin {{was born}} in either Koboko or Kampala to a Kakwa father and Lugbara mother. In 1946 he joined the King's African Rifles (KAR) of the British Colonial Army. Initially a cook, he rose to the {{position}} of lieutenant, taking part in British actions against Somali rebels in the Shifta War and then the Mau Mau rebels in Kenya. Following Uganda's independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, Amin remained in the armed forces, rising {{to the position of}} major and being appointed Commander of the Army in 1965. Aware that Ugandan President Milton Obote was planning on arresting him for misappropriating army funds, Amin launched a 1971 military <b>coup</b> <b>and</b> declared himself President.|$|E
5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The <b>coup</b> <b>and</b> its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E

Political stability, verdicts devoid of justice, military <b>coups</b> <b>and</b> interventions, oligarchical bureaucratic structure, and terrorism are important factors assumed to be fixed. Although these factors may seem irrelevant at first glance, they have crucial impacts on economies. Important determinants of Turkey’s economic performance have been political decisions, the verdicts devoid of justice, in other words biased verdicts, military <b>coups</b> <b>and</b> interventions, oligarchical bureaucratic structure, and terrorism rather than economic policies.
