40|$|ObjectivePrognosis after pericardiectomy {{remains to}} be clearly elucidated, {{especially}} in Asian countries, where the causes of constrictive pericarditis differ from those in Western countries. We aimed to investigate the preoperative prognostic factors and clinical outcomes after pericardiectomy in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis.</b> MethodsPreoperative clinical and imaging characteristics were evaluated in 85 consecutive patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> without other valvular or ischemic heart diseases who underwent pericardiectomy. Causes were idiopathic in 49 patients (57. 6 %) and tuberculous in 36 patients (42. 4 %). All-cause death was observed for a median of 38. 5 months. ResultsOf 85 patients, 15 (17. 6 %) died during follow-up. These 15 patients who died during follow-up had higher aspartate aminotransferase, smaller left ventricular end-systolic dimension index, and higher early diastolic mitral inflow velocity before pericardiectomy than the 70 patients who survived. Multivariate Cox proportional analysis showed that diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio, 4. 610; P = . 024) and high early diastolic mitral inflow velocity (hazard ratio, 1. 050 /cm/s; P = . 002) before pericardiectomy were independent predictors of mortality after pericardiectomy. The preoperative cutoff value for early diastolic mitral inflow velocity in predicting mortality after pericardiectomy was 71 cm/s (sensitivity of 84. 6 % and specificity of 52. 2 %), {{and there was a}} significant difference in survival between groups divided by this cutoff value of early diastolic mitral inflow velocity (P = . 029). ConclusionsPreoperative high early diastolic mitral inflow velocity and diabetes mellitus were predictors of poor prognosis after pericardiectomy in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis.</b> These results suggest that preoperative Doppler echocardiographic evaluation may be valuable not only for diagnosing constrictive pericarditis but also for predicting prognosis after pericardiectomy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractConstrictive {{pericarditis}} {{is caused}} by adhesions between the visceral and parietal layers of the pericardium and progressive pericardial fibrosis that restricts diastolic filling of the heart.

In patients with clinical suspicion of underlying <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis,</b> the most important radiologic diagnostic feature is abnormal pericardial thickening, which can be shown readily by computed tomography (CT) and especially by MRI, and is highly suggestive of <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis.</b> Nevertheless, a thickened pericardium does not always indicate <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis.</b> Furthermore, <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> can occur without pericardial thickening...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether patients with constrictive pericarditis have changes in collagen content and architecture that could influence left ventricular function. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Biopsy specimens of myocardium from 13 patients admitted consecutively {{for treatment of}} <b>chronic</b> <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> were compared with normal heart tissue taken at necropsy from 15 patients free of cardiac disease. INTERVENTION: Pericardiectomy through median sternotomy. Biopsy specimens (4 or 5) {{were taken from the}} left ventricular free wall. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Biochemical and histological assessment of total collagen content, relative proportion of type I and III collagen, and amount of orthogonal collagen fibre meshwork (crosshatching) in the left ventricular tissue. RESULTS: There was more collagen in the myocardium of patients with constrictive pericarditis than in controls when measured either biochemically by hydroxyproline content (89. 4 v 50. 4 mg/g dry weight) or by histological measurement of the collagen fraction of the myocardium (2. 4 % v 7. 0 %). Neither of these measurements, however, correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction, pulmonary wedge pressure, or right ventricular end diastolic pressure. The thickness of the fibrous trabeculae in the myocardium was, however, inversely related to both left ventricular ejection fraction (r = - 0. 76) and deceleration time (r = - 0. 68). Trabecular thickening was also related to NYHA class, with those in class III and IV having the greatest thickening.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the value of two-dimensional echocardiography in detecting <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis.</b> Serial two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in eight closed chest conscious dogs with experimental <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis,</b> using a new model that creates <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> by the introduction of a pericardial irritant mixture. <b>Constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> was confirmed in these dogs by cardiac catheterization and pathologic examination. Four patients with <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> and three patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy (amyloidosis) were also studied. Analysis of short-axis two-dimensional echocardiograms was performed to determine the frame by frame change in left ventricular cavity areas throughout diastole. Curves of diastolic left ventricular cavity area change versus percent duration of diastole were constructed for each animal and human subject. Pericardial thickness was measured at various gain settings on two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiograms and at postmortem examination. In dogs with <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis,</b> the echocardiograms seriously overestimated and correlated poorly with pathologic measurements of pericardial thickness. In dogs after <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> developed, 69 ± 11 % (mean ± SD) (range 50 to 84) of cavity area change occurred in the initial 30 % of diastole compared with 35 ± 7 % (range 20 to 45) in control two-dimensional echocardiograms (p < 0. 001). Four patients with <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> showed similar accelerated cavity expansion in early diastole, but three patients with cardiac amyloidosis showed more variable left ventricular diastolic expansion rates.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the utility of {{measuring}} respiratory variation in pulmonary venous flow by transesophageal echocardiography. Background. Respiratory variation of atrioventricular and central venous flow velocities by Doppler echocardiography has been used to differentiate <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Methods. We performed pulsed wave Doppler transesophageal echocardiography of the left or right pulmonary veins in 31 patients with diastolic dysfunction. Fourteen patients had <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis,</b> and 17 had restrictive cardiomyopathy. We measured the pulmonary venous peak systolic and diastolic flow velocities and the systolic/diastolic flow ratio with transesophageal echocardiography during expiration and inspiration. The percent change in Doppler flow velocity from expiration to inspiration (%E) was calculated. Results. Pulmonary venous peak systolic flow in both inspiration and expiration was greater in <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> than in restrictive cardiomyopathy. The %E for peak systolic flow tended to be higher in <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> (19 % vs. 10 %, p = 0. 09). In contrast, pulmonary venous peak diastolic flow during inspiration was lower in <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> than in restrictive cardiomyopathy. The %E for peak diastolic flow was larger in <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> (29 % vs. 16 %, p = 0. 008). The pulmonary venous systolic/diastolic flow ratio was greater in <b>constrictive</b> <b>pericarditis</b> in both inspiration and expiration.
