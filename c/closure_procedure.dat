40|$|Background: Access sites {{other than}} the {{anterior}} gastric wall may provide improved ergonomics for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guidance significantly reduces, but does not eliminate, risk of access through these alternate sites. This study evaluates the utility of hydroperitoneum {{as an adjunct to}} EUS-guided access and closure of alternate access sites for NOTES. Methods: Access and <b>closure</b> <b>procedures</b> were initially performed with EUS guidance alone, and subsequently, because of complications resulting from this technique, the procedures were performed {{with the aid of a}} transabdominal hydroperitoneum. Results: In this nonrandomized study, 6 access and <b>closure</b> <b>procedures</b> performed with EUS guidance alone resulted in 4 complications. After modifying the technique to incorporate pre-access hydroperitoneum, 7 EUS-guided access and <b>closure</b> <b>procedures</b> were performed without significant complications.

A less invasive non-surgical approach with transcatheter devices was developed to occlude ASD. Amplatzer® septal occluder (ASO) is a common device in transcatheter closure. Objective To compare two secundum ASD closure procedures, transcatheter closure by ASO and surgical closure, in terms of efficacy, complications, length of hospital stay, and total costs. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on children with secundum ASD admitted to the Cardiology Center of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital from January 2005 to December 2011. Patients received either transcatheter closure with ASO or surgical closure procedures. Data was obtained from patients’ medical records. Results A total of 112 secundum ASD cases were included in this study, consisting of 42 subjects who underwent transcatheter <b>closure</b> <b>procedure</b> by ASO and 70 subjects who underwent surgical <b>closure</b> <b>procedure.</b> Procedure efficacies of surgery and ASOo {{were not significantly different}} (98. 6 % vs 95. 2 %, respectively, P= 0. 555). However, subjects who underwent surgical procedures had significantly more complications than subjects who underwent transcatheter <b>closure</b> <b>procedure</b> (60 % vs 28. 6 %, respectively, OR 1. 61; 95 %CI 1. 19 to 2. 18; P= 0. 001). Hospital stays were also significantly longer for surgical patients than for transcatheter closure patients (6 days vs 2 days, respectively, P< 0. 0001). In addition, all surgical subjects required intensive care. Transcatheter closure had a mean total cost of 52. 7 (SD 6. 7) million Rrupiahs while the mean cost of surgery was 47 (SD 9. 2) million Rupiahs (P< 0. 0001). Since the ASO device cost represented 58 % of the total cost of transcatheter closure, the mean cost of transcatheter <b>closure</b> <b>procedure</b> without the device itself was less costly than surgery. Conclusion Transcatheter closure using ASO has a similar efficacy to that of surgical <b>closure</b> <b>procedure.</b> However, subjects who underwent transcatheter closure have lower complication rates and shorter length of hospital stays than subjects who had surgery, but transcatheter closure costs are higher compared to the surgical procedure.

40|$|Abstract. Defined benefit {{pension plans}} provide their {{beneficiaries}} with a prespecified retirement income related {{to years of}} service and wage. However, as pension contracts are not entirely legally enforceable, such payments of defined benefit pension plans are not completely irreversible. The pension deal can be closed early or converted, i. e. the sponsor {{might be tempted to}} change the nature of the pension fund liabilities from defined ben-efit to defined contribution to avoid excessive premium increases when the pension plan funding ratio deteriorates and crosses the regulatory minimum. This paper is the first to analyze market–consistent valuation of option–adjusted pension liabilities in a contingent claim framework whereby a knock–out barrier framework is built into the model in order to capture early closure of a pension plan. We mainly investigate two cases which we call “immediate <b>closure</b> <b>procedure</b> ” and “delayed closure procedure”. In an immediate <b>closure</b> <b>procedure,</b> when the assets value hits the regulatory boundary, the pension plan is terminated immediately. Whereas in a delayed <b>closure</b> <b>procedure,</b> a grace period is given to the pension fund for reorganization and recovery and only an underfunding longer than a certain period leads to premature closure.

40|$|Introduction: Pilonidal sinuses {{typically}} {{occur in}} the sacrococcygeal skin of young adults and its treatment is surgery. The most common methods are excision with or without primary <b>closure</b> <b>procedures.</b> Considering that the recent researches have shown different results, we have compared the recurrence rate of pilonidal sinus using the 2 methods. Materials and Methods: The study was studied on 250 patients, who had gone under pilonidal sinus surgery {{for the first time}} at least 5 months ago. Recurrence rate and signs of recovery were studied. Patients with experience a painful period until 5 months after the surgery were excluded. Finally, 123 patients with open surgery and 127 with closed surgery were included. Results: Recurrence rate was 9. 8 % (12 cases) in open surgery and 11 % (14 cases) in closed surgery. Probability of non- recurrence after 1, 2 and 5 years were 99 %, 95 % and 91 % after open surgery and 97 %, 94 % and 87 % after closed surgery respectively. Type of surgery has no affect on pilonidal sinuses recurrence. Conclusion: Findings showed that there was not significant difference in the recurrence rate of pilonidal sinus after excision between with and without primary <b>closure</b> <b>procedures.</b> Regarding to less complication, excision and primary closure, as a preferred procedure in the management of pilonidal sinus disease, is recommended...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} procedures for successful school closure as utilized by school corporations with prior histories of school closings. An interview guide was developed to identify school <b>closure</b> <b>procedures</b> utilized by participant school corporations and to assess the contribution of such procedures to successful school closure. The superintendents of participating school corporations responded to the interview guide. Three Indiana school corporations participated in the study. Communities and school corporations of various sizes experienced common school closure problems. School closure was an emotionally laden, intensely human problem. School closure necessitated intricate knowledge of the community and carefully planned public relations. Parent, staff, and community stress was apparent throughout school closure. Elementary student adjustment following school closure was generally rapid and uneventful. The need for school closure was a result of declining student enrollment and increased per-pupil costs for education. School closure did not provide an immediate source of money. Superintendents reported the savings precipitated by school closure were long-term instead of immediate financial savings. A sequence of twenty procedures for successful school closure was established. The procedures included pre-closure and post-closure strategies as well as actual <b>closure</b> <b>procedures.</b> The sequence of twenty procedures included: enrollment projections, determining the need to close schools, determining which school buildings should be closed, community involvement and adjustment, staff involvement and adjustment, parent involvement and adjustment, student involvement and adjustment, building disposition, and utilization of the media.

40|$|Background: Transcatheter {{occlusion}} {{has been}} applied to treat ostium secundum atrial septal defect (OS ASD) since 1997. During the clinical practice, several postoperative complications including arrhythmia have been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the value of the ratio of atrial septal occluder (ASO) versus atrial septal length (ASL) for predicting arrhythmia occurrence after transcatheter closure in children with OS ASD. Methods: Six hundred and fifty-one children diagnosed with OS ASD underwent occlusion procedures after completing routine examinations. The onsets and types of arrhythmia both during and after the occlusion procedures were monitored. Treatments were given based on the individual types of arrhythmia. The binary logistic regression analysis and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used in the analysis of value of the ratio of ASO/ASL for predicting postoperative arrhythmia occurrence. Results: Transcather occlusions were conducted in 651 children, among whom 7 children had different types and degrees of arrhythmia, with an incidence of 1. 1 %. The types of arrhythmia included sinus bradycardia, atrial premature beats, bundle branch block, and different degrees of atrioventricular block. Normal electrocardiograph findings were resumed in these 7 patients following active therapies such as corticoids, nutrition, and surgeries. The binary logistic regression and ROC analysis suggested that the ratio of ASO/ASL exhibited an intermediate predictive value for predicting arrhythmia occurrence after occlusion procedures. A cut-off value of 0. 576 in the ratio provided a sensitivity of 87. 5 % and a specificity of 76. 2 % with an area under the ROC curve of 0. 791 (95 % confidence intervals, 0. 655 - 0. 926; P < 0. 05) in predicting arrhythmia occurrence after the <b>closure</b> <b>procedures.</b> Conclusions: The ratio of ASO/ASL might be a useful index for predicting arrhythmia occurrence after <b>closure</b> <b>procedures</b> in children with OS ASD...|$|R
