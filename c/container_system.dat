25|$|German bombing during World War II caused massive {{damage to}} the docks with 380,000 tons of timber {{destroyed}} in the Surrey Docks in a single night. Nonetheless, following post-war rebuilding they experienced a resurgence of prosperity in the 1950s. The end came suddenly, between approximately 1960 and 1970, when the shipping industry adopted the newly invented <b>container</b> <b>system</b> of cargo transportation. London's docks were unable to accommodate the much larger vessels needed by containerization and the shipping industry moved to deep-water ports such as Tilbury and Felixstowe. Between 1960 and 1980, all of London's docks were closed, leaving around eight square miles (21km²) of derelict land in East London. Unemployment was high, and poverty and other social problems were rife.|$|E

[...] "Klimp fasteners" [...] replaced nails and cut costs by about a third, making re-use possible — and Tacoma Box had become the Northwest distributor. Moving and storage containers and a car kennel kit were also introduced in the sixties. Other new products included a unique box made originally in Japan for sujiko (salmon roe); a container developed for the Dole Food Company to transport pineapple juice concentrate; patented nailless bins for shipping cement and salt to Alaska pipeline developers; and money blanks {{the size of a}} dollar bill for the U.S. Treasury Department.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{advantages}} to McLean's <b>container</b> <b>system</b> became apparent, competitors quickly developed. They built bigger ships, larger gantry cranes {{and more sophisticated}} containers. Sea-Land needed cash to stay competitive.

[...] In January 1969, Reynolds agreed to buy Sea-Land for $530 {{million in cash and}} stock. [...] McLean made $160 million personally, and got a seat on the company's board. [...] To carry out the purchase, Reynolds formed a holding company, named R.J. Reynolds Industries, Inc., which bought Sea-Land in May 1969. [...] That same year, Sea-Land ordered five of the largest, fastest container ships in the world - SL-7 class vessels.

Understanding the heat and mass transfer under different load conditions and for freeze-drying in these novel <b>container</b> <b>systems</b> will help in developing a robust freeze-drying process which is also easier to scale-up. Further research and development needs in these emerging areas have also been addressed...|$|R

Hence, this paper proposes an interdisciplinary perspective incorporating the agent paradigm of computer science. In this approach interaction between different autonomous entities is based on standardised communication protocols. In addition, for <b>container</b> security <b>systems</b> a cryptographic concept must be applied in order to secure communication. ...|$|R
