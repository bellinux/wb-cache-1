5|$|In 1962, Lehnsherr is {{tracking}} down Schmidt, while Xavier graduates from the University of Oxford. In Las Vegas, <b>CIA</b> <b>officer</b> Moira MacTaggert follows U.S. Army Colonel Hendry into the Hellfire Club, where she sees Schmidt (now known as Sebastian Shaw), with mutant telepath Emma Frost, cyclone-producing Riptide, and teleporter Azazel. Threatened by Shaw and teleported by Azazel to the Joint War Room, Hendry advocates deployment of nuclear missiles in Turkey. Shaw, an energy-absorbing mutant whose powers have de-aged him, later kills Hendry.|$|E
5|$|For the post-Fleming {{continuation}} Bond authors, Leiter {{has also}} {{appeared on a}} periodic basis. After John Gardner took over writing the James Bond novel series, Leiter made an occasional appearance and the novel For Special Services introduces his daughter, Cedar Leiter, {{who is also a}} <b>CIA</b> <b>officer</b> (and briefly Bond's romantic conquest). Raymond Benson also included Leiter's character in some of his novels, including The Facts of Death and Doubleshot. Similarly the more recent continuation Bond novels—the 2008 Sebastian Faulks novel Devil May Care and the 2011 novel Carte Blanche by Jeffery Deaver—both contained the character.|$|E

5|$|Drawn to theater as a teenager, Hoffman studied acting at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. He {{began his}} screen career in a 1991 episode of Law & Order {{and started to}} appear in films in 1992. He gained {{recognition}} for his supporting work, notably in Boogie Nights (1997), Happiness (1998), Patch Adams (1998), The Big Lebowski (1998), Magnolia (1999), The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), Almost Famous (2000), Punch-Drunk Love (2002), and Along Came Polly (2004). He began to occasionally play leading roles, and for his portrayal of the author Truman Capote in Capote (2005), won multiple accolades including the Academy Award for Best Actor. Hoffman's profile continued to grow, and he received three more Oscar nominations for his supporting work as a brutally frank <b>CIA</b> <b>officer</b> in Charlie Wilson's War (2007), a priest accused of pedophilia in Doubt (2008), and the charismatic leader of a Scientology-type movement in The Master (2012).|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} few days, reports from South Vietnamese {{intelligence}} showed that North Vietnam’s 968th Infantry Division had arrived in South Vietnam’s II Corps from Laos. Two divisions (10th and 320A Infantry Divisions) had taken up positions around Pleiku and Kon Tum, while two regiments (271st and 202nd Regiments) had set up their base in Quang Duc. On March 2 a <b>CIA</b> <b>officer</b> flew out from Nha Trang to inform ARVN Colonel Nguyen Trong Luat of North Vietnamese preparations to attack Ban Me Thuot, without offering information {{on the strength of}} North Vietnamese formations. In response to the CIA report, General Phu ordered the 53rd Regiment to move from Quang Duc to Ban Me Thuot, and the 45th Regiment from Thuan Man to Thanh An-Don Tham. General Phu did not make any further changes to the South Vietnamese order of battle in or around Ban Me Thuot. Thus, by the time the North Vietnamese opened fire on Ban Me Thuot, General Phu had simply failed to implement an effective plan to save II Corps.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the season}} one finale, Safran {{confirmed}} that all series regulars would {{return for the}} second season, except for Acosta, Ellington and Hopkins, whose characters were killed off. Safran also expressed interest in bringing back Cross's Claire Haas after {{it was revealed that}} she was involved in the bombing plot. Safran also discussed the return of Henry Czerny, who played CIA director Matthew Keyes in the season one finale, since the character was important to the storyline. In July 2016, Czerny joined the cast in the recurring role. The series added three regulars to the cast: Russell Tovey as Harry Doyle, Blair Underwood as <b>CIA</b> <b>officer</b> Owen Hall and Pearl Thusi as type-A attorney Dayana Mampasi. In July 2016, Aarón Díaz joined the series in a recurring role as photojournalist León Velez, and it was reported that Tracy Ifeachor and David Lim were cast in recurring roles as Lydia Hall and Sebastian Chen. In early 2017, Hunter Parrish and Krysta Rodriguez were cast in the recurring roles of Clay Haas and Maxine Griffin.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, two {{employees}} of Sveriges Radio contacted Guillou at Folket i Bild/Kulturfront {{with a story}} of a colleague that had been recruited by a <b>CIA</b> <b>officer</b> in Stockholm. They had earlier been turned down by a major newspaper, and now asked the journalist that had exposed IB if he could publish the story. The three worked out a scenario where the CIA recruiter could be legally accused of espionage, and instructed the recruit to collect evidence thereof. Unbelievable enough, the <b>CIA</b> <b>officer</b> agreed to give his spy written instructions of what information to retrieve, so the informal counter-intelligence group had only to stockpile these, take photographs of the two spies meeting, and discuss how much they needed before the final exposure would be made.|$|E

25|$|In {{testifying before}} Congress, both former DCIs John McCone and Richard Helms were {{informed}} beforehand by a <b>CIA</b> <b>officer</b> {{as to what}} documents Congress had been given and hence the probable contours of its knowledge.
