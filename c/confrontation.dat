40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the psychosocial dynamics involved in male prisoner-on-prisoner <b>confrontations</b> (fights, assaults, arguments and threats). The psychosocial literature on aggression suggests shame, masculinity and a weak sense of self may predispose individuals to engage in <b>confrontations</b> {{as a means of}} ego defence (Gaylin, 1984; Katz, 1988; de Zulueta, 1994; & Gilligan, 1996). This study seeks to examine whether measures of shame and masculinity derived from the self-narratives of prison participants can predict involvement in prisoner <b>confrontations.</b> Eighty-nine adult male prisoners were voluntarily recruited from a Category C prison in England and asked to complete various social and psychological questionnaires, whilst also taking part in semi-structured interviews about their life experiences both in and outside of prison. All interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed and then coded for themes of shame and definitions of masculinity. One month later, the participants were also asked to complete a self-reported involvement in prisoner <b>confrontations</b> questionnaire. The participants’ accounts of their <b>confrontations</b> were analysed to determine what kinds of <b>confrontations</b> occur, in which settings and for what reasons. From these accounts it seems that the participants’ main motivations include defending the self, conforming to prisoner norms, releasing frustration and self-defence. A series of tobit regression analyses were then used to test whether themes of shame, masculinity and biased cognitions could predict the men’s self-reported involvement in prisoner <b>confrontations</b> during the following month. This analysis found that themes of shame and masculinity could significantly predict the participants’ subsequently involvement in prisoner <b>confrontations,</b> whilst controlling for possible confounding variables. Biased cognitions were not found to predict their involvement in <b>confrontations.</b> Participants who reported themes of unresolved and acknowledged shame tended to engage in more <b>confrontations</b> {{than those who did not}} express such themes.
