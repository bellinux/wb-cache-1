25|$|Many {{manufacturers}} of paints, inks, textiles, plastics, and colors have voluntarily adopted the <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> International (CII) {{as a standard}} for identifying the pigments that they use in manufacturing particular colors. First published in 1925, and now published jointly on the web by the Society of Dyers and Colourists (United Kingdom) and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (USA), this index is recognized internationally as the authoritative reference on colorants. It encompasses more than 27,000 products under more than 13,000 generic color index names.|$|E
25|$|In the CII schema, each pigment has {{a generic}} index number that {{identifies}} it chemically, regardless of proprietary and historic names. For example, Phthalocyanine Blue BN {{has been known}} {{by a variety of}} generic and proprietary names since its discovery in the 1930s. In much of Europe, phthalocyanine blue is better known as Helio Blue, or by a proprietary name such as Winsor Blue. An American paint manufacturer, Grumbacher, registered an alternate spelling (Thanos Blue) as a trademark. <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> International resolves all these conflicting historic, generic, and proprietary names so that manufacturers and consumers can identify the pigment (or dye) used in a particular color product. In the CII, all phthalocyanine blue pigments are designated by a generic color index number as either PB15 or PB16, short for pigment blue 15 and pigment blue 16; these two numbers reflect slight variations in molecular structure that produce a slightly more greenish or reddish blue.|$|E

50|$|Colorants (both dyes and pigments) {{are listed}} using a dual {{classification}} which use the <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> Generic Name (the prime identifier) and <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> Constitution Numbers. These numbers are prefixed in Brazil {{and various other}} countries with C.I. or CI, for example, CI 15510. This abbreviation is sometimes thought to be CL, due to the font used to display the information. A detailed record of products available on the market is presented under each <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> reference. For each product name, <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> International lists the manufacturer, physical form, and principal uses, with comments supplied by the manufacturer to guide prospective customers.|$|E
5000|$|Today, cobalt {{chromate}} {{is sometimes}} marketed under the cerulean blue name but is darker and greener (Rex Art <b>colour</b> <b>index</b> PB 36) than the cobalt stannate version (<b>colour</b> <b>index</b> PB 35).

50|$|Together {{with the}} American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, SDC publishes the <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> International, which is {{recognized}} as the authoritative source on colourants. <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> International is used to identify the pigments and dyes used in manufacturing inks, paints, textiles, plastics, and other materials. Since 1884 SDC have published the Journal of the Society of Dyers and Colourists, a journal relaunched in 2001 as Coloration Technology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> International is a {{reference}} database jointly {{maintained by the}} Society of Dyers and Colourists and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists. It currently contains over 27,000 individual products listed under 13,000 <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> Generic Names. It was first printed in 1925 but is now published exclusively on the web. The index serves as a common reference database of manufactured colour products and is used by manufacturers and consumers, such as artists and decorators.|$|E

50|$|Due to berberine's strong yellow color, Berberis {{species were}} used to dye wool, leather, and wood. Wool is still dyed with berberine today in {{northern}} India. Under ultraviolet light, berberine shows a strong yellow fluorescence, so it is used in histology for staining heparin in mast cells. As a natural dye, berberine has a <b>colour</b> <b>index</b> of 75160.|$|E
50|$|Hematein (US spelling) or {{haematein}} is an oxidized {{derivative of}} haematoxylin, used in staining. Haematein {{must not be}} confused with haematin, which is a brown to black iron-containing pigment formed by decomposition of haemoglobin. In the <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> (but nowhere else), haematein is called haematine, a confusing word that wrongly implies that the compound is an amine.|$|E

In U.S.P. # 5,096,801 Koya et al., of Fuji Photo Film company, list some 150-200 chemical structures, mainly azo dyes and pyrazolone-diazenyl, but fail to provide chemical names, CAS Registry numbers, or <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> numbers.|$|E

50|$|Further {{support to}} the single body origin comes from the known colours: all2 the {{satellites}} appear light red, with <b>colour</b> <b>indices</b> B-V= 0.76 and V-R= 0.47and infrared spectra, similar to D-type asteroids.These data are consistent with a progenitor from the Hilda family or a Jupiter Trojan.|$|R
5000|$|Bismuth {{vanadate}} is the {{inorganic compound}} with the formula BiVO4. It {{is a bright}} yellow solid. It is a representative of [...] "complex inorganic colored pigments," [...] or CICPs. More specifically bismuth vanadate is a mixed-metal oxide. Bismuth vanadate is also known under the <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> International as C.I. Pigment Yellow 184. [...] It occurs naturally as the rare minerals pucherite, clinobisvanite, and dreyerite.|$|E
5000|$|Papers {{published}} in biochemistry journals frequently refer to these dyes simply as [...] "Coomassie" [...] without specifying which dye was actually used. In fact the <b>Colour</b> <b>Index</b> lists over 40 dyes with [...] "Coomassie" [...] in their name. There are also other Coomassie [...] "blue" [...] dyes. For example, the Merck Index (10th edition) lists Coomassie Blue RL (Acid Blue 92, C.I. 13390) {{which has a}} completely different structure.|$|E
5000|$|... 119 Tauri has a {{spectral}} {{class of}} M2 and a luminosity class of Iab-Ib, intermediate between an intermediate-luminosity supergiant and a less luminous supergiant. It is approximately 1,800 light years from Earth. The star {{is classified as}} a semiregular variable star and its brightness varies from magnitude +4.23 to +4.54 with a period of 165 days. With a <b>colour</b> <b>index</b> of +2.07, {{it is one of}} the reddest naked eye stars in the night sky.|$|E

Measurements by Cassini confirm a featureless spectrum, with a slight absorption at , which could indicate the presence of water.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} use of the Hipparcos astrometric {{parameters}} is the calibration of stellar luminosities against <b>colour</b> <b>indices.</b> The high quality of Hipparcos parameters would however be useless if selection biases were not taken into account. Using parametrical probability density functions, a maximum likelihood algorithm has been developed. It takes into account limiting magnitude or limiting parallax in order to compute unbiased estimates of various parameters: absolute magnitude (as a function of <b>colour</b> <b>indices,</b> metallicity, v sin i), galactic scale height, first and second order moment of the velocity ellipsoid [...] . As a by-product improved estimates of distances can be obtained. A multi-platform, tcl/tk based user interface has been built which allows to determine the relevant parameters using Hipparcos data. The algorithm is described, together with the adopted parametrical models, and several applications are given. Key words: Luminosity calibration. 1...|$|R
40|$|Existing <b>colour</b> <b>indices</b> were {{evaluated}} {{to determine their}} correlation with duration of water saturation, for a hydrosequence in the Grabouw district, Western Cape. Correlation coefficients ranged between 0. 31 and 0. 63. More simple <b>colour</b> <b>indices</b> were developed. Dry soil colour is a relatively good indicator (r = 0. 77) of duration of free water. For this study the equation: Duration of free water = 2. 35 × Huedry + 5. 79 × Valuedry - 7. 31 Chromadry - 27. 89 {{can be used to}} predict duration of free water in diagnostic red apedal B, yellow-brown apedal B, yellow E and grey E horizons. It seems that the present colour definitions for diagnostic horizons in the South African soil classification system are sufficiently accurate to distinguish meaningfully between these horizons with respect to duration of free water.
