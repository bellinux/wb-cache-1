50|$|The CSX-P, ISACA's first <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>certification,</b> was {{introduced}} in the summer of 2015. It {{is one of the few}} certifications that require the individual to work in a live environment, with real problems, to obtain a certification. Specifically, the exam puts test takers in a live network with a real incident taking place. The student's efforts to respond to the incident and fix the problem results in the type of score awarded.|$|E
5000|$|Michigan Cyber Range was {{established}} by Merit Network {{in the summer of}} 2012 to teach <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>certification</b> courses and to provide cybersecurity-related services. [...] Merit Network staffs and operates the Michigan Cyber Range in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Range's infrastructure contains virtual servers placed on Merit's fiber-optic network. The Michigan Cyber Range currently has four physical locations in Michigan, on the campuses of Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan, Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Northern Michigan University in Marquette, and the 110th Attack Wing facility in Battle Creek. Expansion plans could involve as many as 10 sites.|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} goal of {{this report}} is to propose an initial set of common European requirements and broad guidelines that will help fostering IACS <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>certification</b> in Europe in a manner fully compatible with practices adopted beyond. It describes the IACS component <b>Cybersecurity</b> <b>Certification</b> Framework (ICCF) and its components and makes suggestions for its governance, adoption and implementation. This report {{is not intended to}} be a standard, nor aims at the establishment of new ones, as this effort’s focus is to perform and publish a feasibility study that could foster the certification of IACS components in Europe.

5000|$|Mile2 has {{developed}} and provides 15 internationally recognized, proprietary <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>certifications,</b> {{which have been}} accredited by CNSS 4011-4016 and are approved on the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Security Careers and Studies' (NICCS) training schedule for the Department of Homeland Security. [...] On January 13, 2013, Mile2 entered into a collaborative partnership with Merit Network to provide <b>cybersecurity</b> courseware and <b>certifications</b> through the Michigan Cyber Range.|$|R
50|$|Mile2 is an {{information}} technology security company that develops and provides proprietary accredited <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>certifications.</b> The company's technology security programs are utilized in {{the private and public}} sectors, including by Boeing, Canada's Department of National Defense, the National Security Agency, the United States Air Force, the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS), the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and others.|$|R
40|$|All studies {{recently}} published agree. Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) increasingly constitutes {{a target for}} cyber-attacks aiming at disturbing Member States’ economies, at disabling our critical infrastructures or at taking advantage from our people. Such hostile acts {{take place in a}} context of geostrategic tensions, for the satisfaction of organised crime’s purposes, or else in support of possible activist causes. In this context, the ERNCIP Thematic Group (TG) “Case studies for the cybersecurity of Industrial Automation & Control Systems” was started in January 2014 to answer the question: “Do European critical infrastructure operators need to get IACS’ components or subsystems tested and “certified” (T&C) with regards to their cybersecurity?” And should the answer have been yes, it had to answer a corollary question: “What are (roughly) the conditions of feasibility for implementing successfully a European IACS components <b>cybersecurity</b> Compliance & <b>Certification</b> Scheme?” This TG’s undertaking was a research project, not a task force seeking to deliver an immediately applicable standard. It mobilised representatives of IACS vendors, industrial operators, European Istitutions and national cybersecurity authorities. JRC. G. 5 -Security technology assessmen...|$|R
40|$|TechCon 2017 (CRUSER) Presented by CAPT Reza Ghaffari, USN (ret) : PMA 266 Today, Cybersecurity {{challenges}} are growing rapidly as our Information Technology architecture getting {{more sophisticated and}} complex. Our level of demand to acquire greater number of qualified cybersecurity professionals in order to counter these threats is growing in much higher speed than we can supply. The only choice we have is to be more efficient, effective and selective I order to identify high priority and essential areas to focus and make a positive difference for better result and success of our mission. Protect, Detect, React, and Restore sounds great, {{but it should be}} in the areas that are going to reduce/degrade our mission readiness. We have to be selective and focus on the Security Controls that can impact to our mission functionalities and readiness. How DoD is focused on directive compliance when it comes to <b>Cybersecurity</b> <b>certification,</b> but seems to lack emphasis on day-to-day execution of operations/missions functionalities per relative cyber threats and vulnerabilities. While there may be no question that a "checklist" or other process is needed, the ability to implement a justifiable process that can be implemented and utilized with sufficient cyber threat evidence may be a concern.
