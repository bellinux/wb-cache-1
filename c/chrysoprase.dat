25|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO2), {{also known}} as silica, {{is one of the}} most well-studied compounds, second only to water. Twelve {{different}} crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-quartz, a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone. It is also known to occur pure as rock crystal; impure forms are known as rose quartz, smoky quartz, morion, amethyst, and citrine. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as chalcedony, <b>chrysoprase,</b> carnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, heliotrope, and flint. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite, as well as the much less common coesite and stishovite. Biologically generated forms are {{also known as}} kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth. Vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tectites, and obsidian, and rarely as lechatelierite. Some synthetic forms are known as keatite and W-silica. Opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.|$|E

50|$|The Crown of Norway is {{the crown}} of the King of Norway and was made in Stockholm in 1818 by {{goldsmith}} Olof Wihlborg. The crown is a corona clausa (closed model) consisting of a ring carrying eight hoops made of gold and surmounted by a globe of blue enamel and an amethyst cross on top of it. The crown is decorated with many pearls and gemstones including amethysts, <b>chrysoprases,</b> a topaz and an alexandrite. Its front is adorned with a huge green tourmaline, a gift of the Brazilian consul in Stockholm to King Charles III Johan. Its splendid colours and its richly elaborated ornaments make the crown typical of the Empire period. Although the goldsmith work {{was carried out by}} Olof Wihlborg, it is not known who designed the crown.|$|R
5000|$|Queen's crown: made in Stockholm in 1830 by {{goldsmith}} Erik Lundberg. It was modelled {{after the}} Swedish queen consort's crown. The crown is a corona clausa {{consisting of a}} gold circlet of eight larger stones (two amethysts, four topazes and two <b>chrysoprases)</b> alternating with eight smaller stones (amethysts) with rosettes of seven small pearls between each of these and surrounded by an engraved design of roses leaves. On the rim of this circlet rises eight leaves, each set with a round amethyst, alternating with eight large half pearls. From behind these leaves rises eight half arches of a leaf design, each set with seven progressively smaller oval amethysts (except the first stone in the front half arch which is set with a rectangler topaz) and supporting at the top, on a row of small pearls, a blue enamel orb with an equator and meridian band of small pearls supporting a pearl cross at the top. The crown is lined with a red velvet cap with seed pearls embroidered in a branch-like design behind each of the large half pearls {{on the rim of}} the circlet and at the top of the cap, an eight pointed star shaped gold button set with a large pearl.|$|R

40|$|Materials {{research}} {{was aimed at}} finding specific characteristics, which could indicate the provenance of mural paintings uncovered in Bishops castle in Lidzbark Warmiński, northeast Poland. An expected relation of these murals to Bohemian artistic workshops, which were active in the 14 th century at the Emperor Charles IV’s court in Prague, was supported by further exact data. The lead-tin yellow – type II was identified by X-ray microdiffraction; {{up to the present}} day, this uncommon modification of the pigment was proved solely in the Bohemian painting of the 14 th century (e. g. Master of Třeboň altarpiece) and in the Italian painting of the 14 th to 16 th century. Nickel is an element accompanying natural iron-based pigments and was found both in the painting and the drawing, respectively. It is possible to demonstrate that this admixture indicates the source locality of the pigment in Lower Silesia, which belonged to the Kingdom of Bohemia in the 14 th century and was exploited for <b>chrysoprases</b> – green gemstones frequently appearing in Bohemian jewellery and wall decorations (St. Wenceslas chapel in the Prague’s cathedral, Karlštejn Castle). Lidzbark murals exhibit features similar to the panel painting, e. g. the use of tempera, natural chalk in the preparatory layer, lead pigments and madder lakes in the painting. The madder was extracted from the wool fibres, which are still clearly visible in the samples...|$|R
5000|$|The King's Crown: made in Stockholm in 1818 by {{goldsmith}} Olof Wihlborg, {{the crown}} is a corona clausa (closed model) of gold {{consisting of a}} circlet bearing eight large stones, primarily amethysts and <b>chrysoprases</b> surrounded by a wreath of oak leaves with three pearls set as acorns between each of these stones, the largest of these being a large oval green tourmaline, a gift of the Brazilian consul in Stockholm to King Charles III Johan in the front. From {{on the rim of}} this circlet are eight gold strawberry leaves, each set with a precious or semi-precious stone (except that covered by the large tourmaline in the front), between which are set eight pairs of gold oak leaves with pearl set acorn between them. From behind these strawberry leaves rises eight half arches, four of them being each set with four precious or semi-precious stones alternating with four pairs of oak leaves and pairs of pearls and the other four half arches consisting of gold branches of laurel leaves. These half-arches support a blue enameled orb sprinkled with gold stars and surround by an equator and meridian band of half-pearls and supporting at its top a Latin cross of six amethysts.

60|$|These {{being what}} we have usually to deal with, Nature seems to have set herself to make these three {{substances}} as interesting to us, and as beautiful for us, as she can. The clay, being a soft and changeable substance, she doesn't take much pains about, as we have seen, till it is baked; she brings the colour into it only when it receives a permanent form. But the limestone and flint she paints, in her own way, in their native state: and her object in painting them seems to be {{much the same as}} in her painting of flowers; to draw us, careless and idle human creatures, to watch her a little, and see what she is about--that being on the whole good for us,--her children. For Nature is always carrying on very strange work with this limestone and flint of hers: laying down beds of them {{at the bottom of the}} sea; building islands out of the sea; filling chinks and veins in mountains with curious treasures; petrifying mosses, and trees, and shells; in fact, carrying on all sorts of business, subterranean or submarine, which it would be highly desirable for us, who profit and live by it, to notice as it goes on. And apparently to lead us to do this, she makes picture-books for us of limestone and flint; and tempts us, like foolish children as we are, to read her books by the pretty colours in them. The pretty colours in her limestone-books form those variegated marbles which all mankind have taken delight to polish and build with from the beginning of time; and the pretty colours in her flint-books form those agates, jaspers, cornelians, bloodstones, onyxes, cairngorms, <b>chrysoprases,</b> which men have in like manner taken delight to cut, and polish, and make ornaments of, from the beginning of time; and yet, so much of babies are they, and so fond of looking at the pictures instead of reading the book, that I question whether, after six thousand years of cutting and polishing, there are above two or three people out of any given hundred, who know, or care to know, how a bit of agate or a bit of marble was made, or painted.|$|R
60|$|I {{shall not}} attempt to recount the details of our {{intercourse}} during the week that followed. There were moments of stress and strain when {{it seemed to me}} that we could not wait, moments that strengthened Nancy's resolution to leave immediately for the East: there were other, calmer periods when the wisdom of her going appealed to me, since our ultimate union would be hastened thereby. We overcame by degrees the distastefulness of the discussion of ways and means.... We spent an unforgettable Sunday among the distant high hills, beside a little lake of our own discovery, its glinting waters sapphire and <b>chrysoprase.</b> A grassy wood road, at the inviting entrance to which we left the automobile, led down through an undergrowth of laurel to a pebbly shore, and there we lunched; there we lingered through the long summer afternoon, Nancy with her back against a tree, I with my head in her lap gazing up at filmy clouds drifting imperceptibly across the sky, listening to the droning notes of the bees, notes that sometimes rose in a sharp crescendo, and again were suddenly hushed. The smell of the wood-mould mingled with the fainter scents of wild flowers. She had brought along a volume by a modern poet: the verses, as Nancy read them, moved me,--they were filled with a new faith to which my being responded, the faith of the forth-farer; not the faith of the anchor, but of the sail. I repeated some of the lines as indications of a creed to which I had long been trying to convert her, though lacking the expression. She had let the book fall on the grass. I remember how she smiled down at me with the wisdom of the ages in her eyes, seeking my hand with a gesture that was almost maternal.|$|E
60|$|I {{have put}} this {{attribute}} of beauty last, because I consider it the girdle and safeguard {{of all the}} rest, and in this respect the most essential of all, for {{it is possible that}} a certain degree of beauty may be attained {{even in the absence of}} one of its other constituents, as sometimes in some measure without symmetry or without unity. But the least appearance of violence or extravagance, of the want of moderation and restraint, is, I think, destructive of all beauty whatsoever in everything, color, form, motion, language, or thought, giving rise to that which in color we call glaring, in form inelegant, in motion ungraceful, in language coarse, in thought undisciplined, in all unchastened; which qualities are in everything most painful, because the signs of disobedient and irregular operation. And herein we at last find the reason of that which has been so often noted respecting the subtilty and almost invisibility of natural curves and colors, and why it is that we look on those lines as least beautiful which fall into wide and far license of curvature, and as most beautiful which approach nearest (so that the curvilinear character be distinctly asserted) to the government of the right line, as in the pure and severe curves of the draperies of the religious painters; and thus in color it is not red, but rose-color which is most beautiful, neither such actual green as we find in summer foliage partly, and in our painting of it constantly; but such gray green as that into which nature modifies her distant tints, or such pale green and uncertain as we see in sunset sky, and in the clefts of the glacier and the <b>chrysoprase,</b> and the sea-foam; and so of all colors, not that they may not sometimes be deep and full, but that there is a solemn moderation even in their very fulness, and a holy reference beyond and out of their own nature to great harmonies by which they are governed, and in obedience to which is their glory. Whereof the ignorance is shown in all evil colorists by the violence and positiveness of their hues, and by dulness and discordance consequent, for the very brilliancy and real power of all color is dependent on the chastening of it, as of a voice on its gentleness, and as of action on its calmness, and as all moral vigor on self-command. And therefore as that virtue which men last, and with most difficulty attain unto, and which many attain not at all, and yet that which is essential to the conduct and almost to the being of all other virtues, since neither imagination, nor invention, nor industry, nor sensibility, nor energy, nor any other good having, is of full avail without this of self-command, whereby works truly masculine and mighty are produced, and by the signs of which they are separated from that lower host of things brilliant, magnificent and redundant, and farther yet from that of the loose, the lawless, the exaggerated, the insolent, and the profane, I would have the necessity of it foremost among all our inculcating, and the name of it largest among all our inscribing, in so far that, over the doors of every school of Art, I would have this one word, relieved out in deep letters of pure gold,--Moderation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Chrysoprase</b> is cryptocrystalline, {{which means}} that it is {{composed}} of crystals so fine that they cannot be seen as distinct particles under normal magnification.

50|$|Unlike emerald which {{owes its}} green {{color to the}} {{presence}} of chromium, the color of <b>chrysoprase</b> is due to trace amounts of nickel compounds in the form of very small inclusions.
