40|$|The {{management}} of the bark of rubber tree {{over a long period}} is a major concern for rubber planters in order to cope with problems of early replanting due to limited financial means. One of the efficient solutions to this concern is tapping with less longer tapping cuts. The reduction of the tapping <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> in reverse tapping permits to manage better the tapping panel, to improve the productivity of the tapper and to increase the economical life span of rubber trees. On that respect, a study was conducted during six years in south-eastern Côte d'Ivoire {{in order to determine the}} <b>length(s)</b> of tapping <b>cut,</b> in downward tapping, which would provide a suitable solution to the problem of rubber farmers. The influence of the reduction of the tapping <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> on the parameters of yield, radial vegetative growth and physiological profile is evaluated in clones GT 1 and PB 235 of Hevea brasiliensis. Half, third, quarter and eighth spiral tapping cuts were compared to each other and to a full spiral cut (control). The reduction of the tapping <b>cuts</b> <b>length</b> induces losses in rubber yield compared with the control which yet are not proportional to the reduction of the tapping <b>cuts</b> <b>length.</b> The yield per centimetre of tapping cut is more important with the short cuts than the long cuts. Very strong correlations were determinate between tapping intensity and rubber yield, tapping intensity and annual mean girth increment and between tapping intensity and physiological parameters (DRC and Pi). The curve tendency equations were also determinate. In terms of rubber yield, the PB 235 fits the reduction of the tapping <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> better than the GT 1. The reduction of tapping <b>cuts</b> <b>length</b> favours a better vegetative radial growth. It does not impair the physiological profile of the trees which show signs of under-exploitation.

40|$|If a weak snow layer below a {{cohesive}} slab {{is present in}} the snow cover, unstable snow conditions can prevail for days or even weeks. We monitored the temporal evolution of a weak layer of faceted crystals as well as the overlaying slab layers at the location of an automatic weather station in the Steintälli field site above Davos (Eastern Swiss Alps). We focussed on the crack propagation propensity and performed propagation saw tests (PSTs) on 7 sampling days during a 2 -month period from early January to early March  2015. Based on video images taken during the tests we determined the mechanical properties of the slab and the weak layer and compared them to the results derived from concurrently performed measurements of penetration resistance using the snow micro-penetrometer (SMP). The critical <b>cut</b> <b>length,</b> observed in PSTs, increased overall during the measurement period. The increase was not steady and the lowest values of critical <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> were observed around the middle of the measurement period. The relevant mechanical properties, the slab effective elastic modulus and the weak layer specific fracture, overall increased as well. However, the changes with time differed, suggesting that the critical <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> cannot be assessed by simply monitoring a single mechanical property such as slab load, slab modulus or weak layer specific fracture energy. Instead, crack propagation propensity {{is the result of a}} complex interplay between the mechanical properties of the slab and the weak layer. We then compared our field observations to newly developed metrics of snow instability related to either failure initiation or crack propagation propensity. The metrics were either derived from the SMP signal or calculated from simulated snow stratigraphy (SNOWPACK). They partially reproduced the observed temporal evolution of critical <b>cut</b> <b>length</b> and instability test scores. Whereas our unique dataset of quantitative measures of snow instability provides new insights into the complex slab-weak layer interaction, it also showed some deficiencies of the modelled metrics of instability – calling for an improved representation of the mechanical properties...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, the {{propagation}} saw test (PST) gained popularity for both avalanche professionals and backcountry recreationalists. A limiting factor of the PST is the additional {{time required to}} isolate a column on the sidewall of the snowpit. Since I often have limited time to dig multiple pits during a work day, this past season I examined the effectiveness of conducting cross-slope PSTs (CPST). The CPST is simply a PST done across, rather than up, the slope. It is more efficient than the PST, particularly after conducting an extended column test (ECT). I collected a total of 28 data sets, including standard PSTs, CPSTs and ECTs during the 2013 / 14 winter season. My data indicate that CPSTs share similar critical <b>cut</b> <b>lengths</b> as standard PSTs, with 75 % of critical <b>cut</b> <b>lengths</b> falling within 10 cm of each other. Though {{it is necessary to}} collect more data to make solid conclusions, there may be a slope angle effect where CPSTs begin to have shorter <b>cut</b> <b>lengths</b> than standard PSTs as slope angles increase above 28 or 30 degrees. A drawback of the CPST is that some weak layers may be more difficult to follow than in a standard PST. Currently, the CPST cannot be qualified as a standardized stability test, but I hope to continue to collect additional data to better understand how CPSTs are related to PSTs and snowpack stability...|$|E

40|$|An {{increased}} demand for processed goods on the property market has contributed to investments within the Swedish sawmill industry. The purpose with {{this study is to}} make a market investigation of pre <b>cut</b> <b>lengths</b> within a defined geographic area. The constituent for this investigation is HAL (AB Hilmer Andersson) who invests in a new plane facility and two finger jointing machines in affiliation to their sawmill in Lässerud, the vest part of Värmland. To investigate the demand of pre <b>cut</b> <b>lengths</b> and identifies the value creating factors and cost factors which the customer within the segments industry and property market perceive, have different customer value theories been used. Theories of customer value and the theory about offering has been the source of creating the qualitative interview with a selection of current and new potential customers for HAL. The result of the study first gives an introduction of HAL’s new offering and a description of HAL’s current customers, which gives the reader an understanding of why searching for new customers is made in the defined area. The result of the visit interviews (which were made with a selection of current customers) concretises the value creating factors and cost factors which they perceive in current business relation with HAL. An analyse of the result were made with a customer-value-model. The just-in-time and product attribute together with a good personal relation was the main value creating factors, while the price of the product was the conclusive cost factor. A register of interesting Swedish and Norwegian customers were constituted. HAL made a selection of new potential customers from the register that I made visit interviews with. HAL also made a selection of new customers which was called to prove the reliability of the result. The customer which HAL didn’t select {{can be used as a}} future customer database. A match was made between the new potential customers and the value HAL has approved that they can deliver their customers. It was shown in the analyse that all the new potential customers in general matched the value HAL can deliver. Though one of the new potential customers demanded products that HAL cannot produce in their new facility, however there was other in the range of HAL’s products that could be of interest instead. Demanded assortment for the industry customers was pre cut (in millimetre precision) lengths which were direct adapted for their own production. The mostly demanded pre <b>cut</b> <b>lengths</b> of interest were approximately 2, 5 m for weathering and structural timber. Plank which are used for the course of logs or roof construction are demanded pre cut in longer lengths (more than 5, 4 m). However lengths up to 12 m are today (2010) low. This is mostly apparent in the property market where the most of their own customers are DIY (Do-It-Yourself) and pro customers and they often demand shorter lengths than 6 - 7 m. The roof truss manufacturer (which is a part of the industry segment, due to HAL’s definition) has neither stock capacity for lengths over 6 m nor handling capabilities in their own plants. They demanded timber package that were cut in module lengths which they cut with the angels needed for their own roof truss constructions. The conclusion is therefore that the demand seems to be highest both for pre <b>cut</b> <b>lengths</b> and lengths up to 12 m in the industry segment. Finally in the study there is a review of the usefulness of qualitative research methods for market investigations within the sawmill industry. If HAL takes part of understanding both value creating and cost creating factors the investment will be a successful choice at a customer perspective, because there is a demand big enough to reach HAL’s increase in production capacity in the geographic studied area...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the effect of specific factors on chipper performance by using a mobile industrial chipper in a real-life commercial setting. The comprehensive experimental design consisted of five replications per each combination of two types of raw material, two chip discharge systems, and two <b>cut</b> <b>lengths</b> (i. e., 5 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 40 replications). Each replication consisted of a full 18 -m 3 trailer load. Cut length was manipulated by using different drum types. When all else was equal, the doubling of cut length resulted in a 50 percent increase of average chip length, a 15 percent increase of net productivity, and a 15 percent decrease in fuel consumption. The handling characteristics of the raw material had a strong impact on chipper productivity’, causing variations {{on the order of}} 20 percent. The discharge system had no significant effect on fuel consumption or productivity, but it did impact product quality and bulk density.
