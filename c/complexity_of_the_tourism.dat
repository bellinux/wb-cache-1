40|$|Tourism {{marketing}} {{is still a}} theme which faces difficulties to stablish solid theoretical basis, given the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> amalgam. The touristic attractions and infrastructure-related elements of a tourist location are mentioned in the literature as important for attracting visitors. However, the elements perceived by actors of a touristic destination remain unknown. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} paper was to identify the main elements of attractiveness perceived by stakeholders of an historical destination. Through a qualitative approach the research is based on in-depth interviews with local stakeholders from Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The study showed that the perception of attractiveness of local actors covers the historical and cultural distinct attractions and problems such as lack of service innovation and professionalism. It also points solutions such as the exploitation of potential attractions and product differentiation towards competitors...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: The <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> system, {{as well as}} {{modelling}} in a {{frame of}} system dynamics, {{will be discussed in}} this paper. The phaenomenon of tourism, which possesses the typical properties of global and local organisations, will be presented as an open complex system with all its elements, and an optimal methodology to explain the relations among them. The approach we want to present is due to its transparency an excellent tool for searching systems solutions and serves also as a strategic decision-making assessment. We will present systems complexity and develop three models of a complex tourism system: the first one will present tourism as an open complex system with its elements, which operate inside of a tourism market area. The elements of this system present subsystems, which relations and interdependencies will be explained with two models: causal-loop diagram and a simulation model in frame of systems dynamics...|$|E

Despite the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> system, and the power and flexibility of ABM to overcome the assumptions such as homogeneity, linearity, equilibrium, and rationality typical of traditional modeling techniques, ABM has received little attention from tourism researchers and practitioners. The purpose of this paper is to introduce ABM to a wider tourism audience. Specifically, the appropriateness of tourism as a phenomenon to be subjected to ABM is established; the power and benefits of ABM as an alternative scientific mechanism are illuminated; the few existing applications of ABM in the tourism arena are summarized; and, a range of potential applications in the areas of tourism planning, development, marketing and management is proposed...|$|E

40|$|We {{assess the}} effect of the main {{determinants}} of tourist expenditure by applying both linear and quantile regression models to individual micro data collected by a survey addressed to non-resident tourists who spent their holidays in Sardinia during the period AprileOctober 2012. We find that, in addition to income and foreign nationality, tourist expenditure is crucially driven by trip-related (party size, stay length, accommodation, sea and sun typology and transport modality) and psychographic characteristics (repeated visits and holiday motivations). Moreover, our results indicate that the effects vary with respect to the expenditure component and the level of spending, thus confirming the high <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> product. Higher positive effects were found for heavy spenders in the case of foreign nationality, previous visits and notoriety-motivated holidays, while party size and the number of visited sites contribute to reducing the level of expenditure for light-spending tourists...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{is a vast}} body of {{literature}} about competition, competitive advantage and competitive identity in tourism industry. Competitiveness {{is grounded in the}} strategic and operational advantages businesses have been able to achieve and through the application of these concerns to tourism, the competitive advantage of destinations. Globalization is creating trends and expectations but there is also evidence to suggest that the strong sense of the local community is {{a vital part of the}} destination competitive advantage. Tourism competitiveness is rarely examined at the single business level as the <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> system is based on interaction and interdependency. Therefore the concerns with strategy, structure and rivalry seems a little different within tourism – hence the growing concerns with network partnerships, clusters and co-operations within the tourism literature. Management of tourist services should satisfy the needs of the customer (tourist) and contributes to tourist well-being as well as it should contribute to well being of local community. This is the part of sustainable competitiveness concept...|$|E

The <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> destination as an amalgam of products, facilities and services that together comprise the travel experience (Buhalis, 2003) is enhanced by a lack of centralized control over destination marketing and development activities that characterizes commercial organizations (Laws et a 1., 2002). While, generally, tourism destinations support a body that coordinates marketing and image-building activities, research shows that the major challenge to the ability of tourism destination to build positive destination brand equity (Konecnik and Gartner, 2007) is the achievement of a collaborative environment among the different stakeholders that all together contribute to the delivery of destination experience...|$|E

40|$|Volunteer {{tourism is}} an {{increasingly}} popular practice that provides tourists {{with the opportunity}} to contribute to community development or environmental projects, usually in Third World countries. This research explores <b>the</b> potential <b>of</b> volunteer <b>tourism</b> to develop cross-cultural understanding, transform tourists into more charitable, ethical subjects and foster more reciprocal relations between tourists and visited communities. The research uses a longitudinal methodology to follow ten young people from the UK through time and space as they embark on a journey to Kenya with a commercial volunteer tourism provider. Using a combination of repeated in-depth interviews and participant observation, I show how volunteer tourists produce understandings, or ‘imaginaries’, of poverty, authenticity and care that simultaneously enable and constrain their ability to act ethically. I argue that <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volunteer <b>tourism</b> encounter can only be understood through a psychosocial account of subjectivity that articulates <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> suture between <b>the</b> social and the psychological. Drawing on Lacanian psychoanalytic theory to interpret the volunteer tourists’ narratives, I show {{that it is possible to}} approach <b>the</b> psychological in <b>tourism</b> studies in a non-reductive and culturally engaged way. This psychoanalytic reading provides insight into how volunteer tourists’ perceptions are refracted through cultural fantasies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-Western Other, how they are confronted by <b>the</b> demands <b>of</b> contradictory ideological injunctions and how their investment in consumer identities presents a barrier to ethical transformation. The thesis concludes that in order to harness volunteer tourism’s potential as a means of achieving social transformation, greater attention must be paid to subjectivity and the psychosocial as a way <b>of</b> understanding <b>the</b> social demands, desire and investments experienced by volunteer tourists...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a {{theoretical}} overview of the relevance and impact of stakeholder power in the collaborative process of destination branding. Destination branding {{is defined as the}} process used to develop a unique identity and personality that is different from all competitive destinations. The tourism literature shows consistency in considering the process of branding a destination as a collaborative effort. Collaboration in the context of destination branding has been addressed under two different though complementary points of view such as creation of shared image of the destination and the inclusiveness of the process. The 2 ̆ 7 collective phenomenon 2 ̆ 7 of destination branding, has also been described as a highly complex and politicised activity that includes multiple stakeholders. The definition of tourism as an industry that involves multiple players allows studying the characteristics of the collaboration that occur among stakeholders within a tourism destination and, particularly, in the context of destination branding. Power appears intrinsically connected to the concept of collaboration. The existence of power within collaborative processes has been extensively examined. The <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> system is enhanced by the consideration that there is no other industry in the economy that is linked to so many diverse and different kinds of product and services as is the tourism industry. These characteristics of tourism determine that in every decision making process, like the process of branding a tourism destination, a variety of different interest groups, operating at different levels tends to influence the outcomes of the process...|$|E

Whilst living in the UK in the early 2000 s it became increasingly noticeable {{to me that in}} the highly competitive charity and travel sectors alternatives were being sought to either assist in <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> poor communities or to attract customers via new products. Volunteering as part of a holiday was becoming the new ‘fad’.

Like many other initiatives in development, concern has been raised as to whether volunteer tourism can truly add value to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> poor communities. Is it, in fact, merely a tourism product? This thesis is an innovative attempt to call volunteer tourism to account. Through examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new phenomenon and an analysis of literature and examples in relation to development and volunteer tourism, it will consider whether volunteer tourism has a place in development. To do so, the first chapter will examine the ground breaking initiatives that have infiltrated the development cause in recent decades and assess the value they have provided in poverty alleviation and capacity building.

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this Research Probe is {{to address}} a simple or, on reflection, perhaps simplistic question. As <b>the</b> editor <b>of</b> this journal {{originally}} asked when inviting contributions and rejoinders, is tourism a ‘sinner’ or is it unjustly ‘sinned against’? In other words, since the late nineteenth century, modem tourism has attracted criticism {{in one form or}} another, initially in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> social comment, subsequently in both academic and journalistic circles. Indeed, significant attention has been paid by tourism scholars and others to <b>the</b> negative consequences <b>of</b> <b>tourism</b> (and, of course, means of mitigating such consequences), {{to the extent that it}} might be assumed that tourism inevitably ‘sins’ against the places and peoples where it occurs. So, the question is posed—it is appropriate to view tourism as such, as <b>the</b> harbinger <b>of</b> social, cultural and environmental problems, or is this unjust criticism? That is, is tourism' sinned against' by those who focus, on occasion in apocalyptic terms, on the problems that are to a lesser or greater extent <b>the</b> inevitable outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>tourism,</b> and is it timely to rebalance the debate, to consider whether an assessment of tourism deserves a more supportive or positive foundation? Given <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>tourism,</b> <b>the</b> enormously variable forms it takes and contexts within which it occurs and, <b>of</b> course, <b>the</b> multiplicity <b>of</b> perspectives from which it can be considered, there are no simple answers or ways <b>of</b> answering <b>the</b> question.

H 577 P SHTM 2015 Lixviii, 313 pages :illustrations; 30 cmA {{small but}} growing {{number of studies have}} {{examined}} <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> by diasporic groups. The literature on migration and tourism provides a foundation for understanding diasporic groups and the reasons for their movements. However, a critical review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature indicates that despite the complexity and highly nuanced nature <b>of</b> diaspora <b>tourism,</b> <b>the</b> current research rarely looks beyond <b>the</b> <b>tourism</b> literature for deeper insights into the diasporic context. In particular, very few studies have attempted to examine diaspora tourists as individuals, or to understand their return travel within a multi-dimensional framework. Moreover, several important themes seem to be missing from <b>the</b> overall investigation <b>of</b> diaspora tourism, such as diasporic individuals' family migration backgrounds, their senses of place and cultural identity, which have seldom been examined together with diaspora tourism under a continuum framework. Diaspora tourism may have varied effects on diasporic individuals, as recent migrants and distant diasporic members can have completely different perceptions of their sense of place before and after their return visits. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct a study focusing on these important themes and examine how diaspora tourism influences diasporic individuals, to gain an in-depth understanding of diaspora tourists and their sense <b>of</b> place. <b>The</b> key research question in this study is whether diasporic tourists' return visits affect their place attachments. <b>The</b> main purposes <b>of</b> this research, therefore, are to explore <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> return visits in shaping diasporic individuals' place attachments, identify the significant factors influencing diasporic place attachments, and develop a theoretical framework to achieve an in-depth understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continuum <b>of</b> diaspora <b>tourism</b> and travel behaviors of diaspora tourists. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in this study. The qualitative methods were chosen to identify the major themes and factors involved in diaspora <b>tourism,</b> and <b>the</b> results achieved were further tested using a larger sample group through quantitative methods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 46 Chinese Americans and Chinese Canadians with return visit experiences in mainland China to gain an in-depth understanding of their return experiences and any changes in their post-return place attachments. Then, a questionnaire survey comprising sections on migration history, place attachment, personal identity, return visit, and social-demographic information was conducted online and through fieldwork. 207 complete and valid questionnaires were used for further quantitative data analysis. The qualitative content analysis was adopted to analyze the in-depth interview data. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to analyze the questionnaire data. Methodological triangulation based on multiple data sources and two main research methods was used to achieve data validation and verification. In <b>the</b> early stage <b>of</b> qualitative data analysis, eight groups of Chinese diaspora tourists were classified according to their cultural identities and changes in place attachments. By subsequent consolidation, five types of diaspora tourists were identified through the most common themes, namely 1) re-affirmative diaspora tourist; 2) quest diaspora tourist; 3) re-connected diaspora tourist; 4) distanced diaspora tourist; and 5) detached diaspora tourist. These five types of diaspora tourists were identified by the patterns in their place attachment changes and common features of migration history, cultural identity, and original sense of place. More importantly, a series of factors were identified influencing diaspora tourists' sense of place, such as their migration reasons and forms, strength of Chineseness, pre-trip place attachment, partnership, and so forth. In some cases, a single factor plays a significant role in diaspora tourists' post-return place attachments, whereas in others, numerous factors were found to contribute to changes in place attachments. These findings indicate <b>the</b> multi-dimensionality <b>of</b> diaspora <b>tourism.</b> <b>The</b> return <b>of</b> diasporic individuals can be understood in a continuum of time and place, in relation to diasporic members' migration histories, trip motivations and experiences, cultural identities, and pre-and post-trip place attachments. The five identified types of Chinese diaspora tourists reflect significant differences in the inputs and outcomes of their return visits, which further confirms <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diaspora <b>tourism</b> phenomenon. As such, this study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, a dynamic perspective from which to examine diaspora tourism is suggested by integrating the literature on migration, cultural identity, and place attachment. Second, findings of this research suggest that diaspora tourists are heterogeneous and can be categorized to five types according to their cultural identities and changes of place attachment. Third, motives of diasporic travel varied significantly among five types of diaspora tourists, from quite deep ones (e. g. the quest and the reconnected diaspora tourists) to quite shallow ones (e. g. the distanced diaspora tourist). Fourth, return experiences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five types <b>of</b> diaspora tourists are different from increasing their place attachment to China (e. g. the re-affirmative, the quest and the reconnected diaspora tourists), no significant change of place attachment (e. g. the distanced diaspora tourist), to decreasing place attachment to China (e. g. the detached diaspora tourists). Fifth, the present research examines <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese diaspora in Canada and the United States. <b>The</b> significant findings <b>of</b> this study can provide valuable insights to the other ethnic minorities and their return visits.
