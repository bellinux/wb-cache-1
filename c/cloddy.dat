In which you may perceive it to be somewhat sharper then elsewhere about d, to be indented or pitted about b, to be broader and thicker about c, and unequal and rugged about e, and pretty even between ab and ef. Nor was that part of the Edge ghik so smooth as one would imagine so smooth bodies as a Hone and Oyl should leave it; for besides those multitudes of scratches, which appear to have raz'd the surface ghik, and to cross each other every way which are not half of them exprest in the Figure, there were several great and deep scratches, or furrows, such as gh and ik, which made the surface yet more rugged, caus'd perhaps by some small Dust casually falling on the Hone, or some harder or more flinty part of the Hone it self. The other part of the Razor ll, which is polish'd on a grinding-stone, appear'd much rougher then the other, looking almost like a plow'd field, with many parallels, ridges, and furrows, and a <b>cloddy,</b> as 'twere, or an uneven surface: nor shall we wonder at the roughnesses of those surfaces, since even in the most curious wrought Glasses for Microscopes, and other Optical uses, I have, when the Sun has shone well on them, discover'd their surface to be variously raz'd or scratched, and to consist of an infinite of small broken surfaces, which reflect the light of very various and differing colours. And indeed it seems impossible by Art to cut the surface of any hard and brittle body smooth, since Putte, or even the most curious Powder that can be made use of, to polish such a body, must consist of little hard rough particles, and each of them must cut its way, and consequently leave some kind of gutter or furrow behind it. And though Nature does seem to do it very readily in all kinds of fluid bodies, yet perhaps future observators may discover even these also rugged; it being very probable, as I elsewhere shew, that fluid bodies are made up of small solid particles variously and strongly mov'd, and may find reason to think there is scarce a surface in rerum naturâ perfectly smooth. The black spot mn, I ghess to be some small speck of rust, for that I have oft observ'd to be the manner of the working of Corrosive Juyces. To conclude, this Edge and piece of a Razor, if it had been really such as it appear'd through the Microscope, would scarcely have serv'd to cleave wood, much less to have cut off the hair of beards, unless it were after the manner that Lucian merrily relates Charon to have made use of, when with a Carpenters Axe he chop'd off the beard of a sage Philosopher, whose gravity he very cautiously fear'd would indanger the oversetting of his Wherry.|$|E

It illustrates less roughly ploughed soils, with a greater quantity of small clods distributed over the soil surface. In this paper, a new description of such rough agricultural surfaces is proposed. It is based on a composite model, including a classical surface represented by an exponential correlation function, together with a random <b>cloddy</b> structure.

A numerical moment-modeling method, based on integral equations, is used to evaluate the contribution of clods to the radar backscattering behavior of agricultural surfaces.

40|$|Soil {{volumetric}} {{structure is}} an important parameter for tillage operation. The aim {{of this paper is}} to assess whether volume characteristics can be inferred from radar measurements. A 2 -D numerical model (the 2 DSCAT model) was developed based on a numerical solver using a time-domain finite-element method to solve Maxwell's equations. Perfectly matched layers were implemented as well as a near- to far-field transformation. A focused incident beam was generated by adapting the boundary conditions. To represent the soil structure, a simulator was developed describing the soil as biphasic media (fine earth and clods). Clods were represented by randomly deformed ellipses, with randomly determined dimensions, locations, and orientations. The model performed successfully, as evaluated against exact analytical solutions available for an infinite perfectly conducting cylinder and the reflection of flat semi-infinite media. The model was then evaluated against measurements made by an X-band FM continuous-wave radar on a box filled with dry clods of different sizes. The effect of the clod size on the backscattering power was very well reproduced, showing the potential of using a 2 -D numerical model to understand microwave-backscattering patterns from <b>cloddy</b> soils. Analysis of the volume scattering shows that this phenomenon can be mostly hidden in the scatter diagram by surface scattering when the latter occurred.

40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} of the soil surface is a key parameter to understanding soil properties and physical processes related to water infiltration or runoff and soil erosion. A seedbed surface has a <b>cloddy</b> structure, {{which is responsible for}} its random roughness. The present study focuses on seedbed cloddiness characterization. It relies on a new gradient-based method, introduced recently in order to identify automatically the individual clods or large aggregates on a three-dimensional digital elevation model (DEM) of the soil surface. We analyze the sensitivity of clod identification and characterization to the gradient estimation method. For this purpose, the partial derivatives are evaluated by four different methods, and a ground truth of clod boundaries has been made by a soil scientist on two seedbed surfaces (an artificial surface and an in-field one). The gradient method involving an error in the fourth power of the spacing and the greatest number of neighboring pixels in the estimation enables an improvement in the sensitivity of clod identification by up to 10 percent, achieving detection performance greater than 73 percent. Comparing segmented contours with ground truth delineation, good agreement is found for half of the clods regardless of the numerical gradient computation method. For the other half, the area is underestimated because {{it is not possible to}} extend the contours. The mean variation of shape parameters is slightly sensitive to the gradient computation, with differences of around 5 percent.

40|$|International audienceA seedbed has a <b>cloddy</b> {{structure}} {{that is highly}} connected to its random roughness. Identifying and characterizing the clods is thus a preliminary step in surface roughness measurement and modelling. The aim {{of this paper is}} to propose an algorithm, based on the simulated annealing optimization, to refine the clod delineation estimated on a seedbed surface Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In our case, the DEM image was recorded on a real seedbed immediately after tillage, and we assume an initialization for the clods boundaries. The proposed method is based on a cost function to minimize, introducing four main characteristics of the clod boundary, respectively related to the mean of the DEM gradient norms on the boundary (f 1), the standard deviation of the DEM gradient norms on the boundary (f 2), the standard deviation of the DEM values on the boundary (f 3) and L 2 -norm of the DEM values on the boundary (f 4). In our case, the relative weights of previous criteria have been learned using a target reference that is a manual delineation of individual clods completed by a soil scientist on a sub-part of the DEM image. The cost function minimization is then achieved using the simulated annealing technics. The result performance is measured in term of the overlap rate.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the aims}} of the tillage {{operation}} is to produce a specific range of clod sizes, suitable for plant emergence. Due to its <b>cloddy</b> structure, a tilled soil surface has its own roughness, which is connected also with soil water content and erosion phenomena. The comprehension and modeling of surface runoff and erosion require that the micro-topography of the soil surface is well estimated. Therefore, the present paper focuses on the soil surface analysis and characterization. An original method consisting in detecting the individual clods or large aggregates on a 3 D digital elevation model (DEM) of the soil surface is introduced. A multiresolution decomposition of the surface is performed by wavelet transform. Then a supervised local maxima extraction is performed on the different sub surfaces and a last process makes the validation of the extractions and the merging of the different scales. The method of detection was evaluated {{with the help of a}} soil scientist on a controlled surface made in the laboratory as well as on real seedbed and ploughed surfaces, made by tillage operations in an agricultural field. The identifications of the clods are in good agreement, with an overall sensitivity of 84 % and a specificity of 94 %. The false positive or false negative detections may have several causes. Some very nearby clods may have been smoothed together in the approximation process. Other clods may be embedded into another peace of the surface relief such as another bigger clod or a part of the furrow. At last, the low levels of decomposition are dependent on the resolution and the measurement noise of the DEM. Therefore, some borders of clods may be difficult to determine. The wavelet-based detection method seems to be suitable for soil surfaces described by 2 or 3 levels of approximation such as seedbeds...|$|E

The depth of tunnels was about 100 m. Any interaction with swelling soils could lead to destruction of the tunnel lining. Suzakh clays demonstrated the following physical and mechanical properties: density of particles of soil ρ= 2, 69 g/cm; soil density ρ = 2. 40 - 2. 47 g/cm; porosity of 8. 2 - 10. 8 %; ultimate resistance to uniaxial compression = 13. 1 - 31. 0 MPa.

40|$|If soil {{conditions}} are not ideal at planting, corn may emerge unevenly. You might eventually {{get a full}} stand, but plants will emerge at different times. This publication discusses why corn emerges unevenly, describes a study that measured how much uneven emergence reduces corn yields, provides some management recommendations for {{what to do with}} uneven emerging stands, and gives suggestions for obtaining uniform emergence. Why Corn Emerges Unevenly The most common reason for uneven corn emergence is dry soil at or shortly after planting. Moisture at seed depth may be adequate for seed germination and emergence in some areas, but not in others. Soil moisture in the seed zone within a field can differ because of variations in soil type and topography, or from uneven distribution of moist and dry soils caused by secondary tillage. <b>Cloddy</b> seedbeds caused by working the ground too wet, can mean poor contact between seed and soil, allowing some seeds to absorb enough moisture to germinate while others are too dry. In many cases, some seeds originally placed in dry soil don't germinate and emerge until after rainfall. This produces a mixture of larger and smaller plants, with plant size differences depending on time from planting to rainfall. Emergence time may vary between parts of fields, from one row to the next, or from one plant to the next. Uneven soil temperature is another cause of uneven corn emergence. Seed-depth soil temperatures can vary if crop residues from reduced tillage systems aren't distributed evenly, if seed depths vary, and if soil within fields varies in type and topography. Corn may also emerge unevenly because of variable soil crusting, herbicide injury or because of insects or diseases. Finally, uneven corn emergence occurs when corn growers, with stand loss or uneven stands, replant by "filling in " the existing stand, rather than tearing up the field and starting over. How Uneven Emergence Affects Grain Yield Competition from larger, early-emerging plants will decrease the yield of smaller, late-emerging plants.

40|$|Poor crop {{establishment}} {{is one of}} the major limitations to the production of grain legumes after rice (Oryza sativa L.) in rainfed lowland lice-based cropping systems. The success of germination and emergence of mungbean (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilzek), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) planted in zero tilled (ZT), zero tilled combined with mulch application (ZTM) and tilled soils (T) were investigated in a {{crop establishment}} trial as a function of sowing delay. Sowing delay was used as a surrogate for soil-water content. This experiment was conducted under a rain-shelter to ensure continuous and progressive drying conditions. A dibbling trial using the same legumes was conducted concurrently and subjected to the: prevailing climatic conditions. Germination and emergence success rate of the traditional dibbling method was compared to dibbling incorporating depth control and seed cover. Both experiments were conducted towards the end of the 1994 rainy season in a Vertisol soil at Ngale and an Andosol soil at Jambegede, in East Java, Indonesia where the season gradually changes from wet to dry season. Mungbean emergence was 93 - 94 % at Ngale and soybean emergence was 83 - 95 % at Jambegede, both in the presence and absence of rain. Peanut emergence was low (50 - 69 %) at both sites. In all three species at both sites, the percentage of seeds that failed to germinate was greater than seeds that failed to emerge, indicating that germination rather than emergence was limiting. Seed rot caused by fungal attack and poor imbibition associated with poor seed-soil contact (observed as intact seeds) were the main constraints for the success of germination of mungbean, soybean and peanut. Thr failure to emerge was mainly caused by seedling rot and the failure of hypocotyl and radicle to penetrate the hard soil, observed as a culling of the hypocotyl, Cultivation at Ngale on a Vertisol resulted in excessively <b>cloddy</b> soil, which in turn resulted in a significant decrease in germination and emergence. The application of straw mulch had little effect on the emergence of legumes on this soil, The use of depth control and application of seed-soil cover did not have a significant effect. Hence the traditional dibbling method where depth of planting ranged from 4 to 7 cm without seed cover was found to be appropriate for planting mungbean and soybean. Germination and emergence of peanut was improved with the application of soil cover and the dibbling stick had a spike added to the tip to assist the root to penetrate the hard compacted soil.

40|$|Knowledge and {{description}} of the micro topographic surface have a large impact on remote sensing and soil science. Several {{studies have focused on}} the characterization of roughness {{and description}} of the surfaces. The understanding and the accounting for the interaction of electromagnetic waves, the flow and the infiltration of the surface with roughness interfaces requires a good {{description of the}} latter. An agricultural soil has clods and holes. Such structuring objects contribute to defining the soil random roughness. The present study focuses on the characterization of these objects and presents an algorithm of surface generation with structuring objects. This study relies on a gradient-based method introduced recently in order to identify automatically the individual clods, holes or large aggregates on a three-dimensional digital elevation model (DEM) of the soil surface [1 - 2]. The DEM under consideration represent seedbed surfaces recorded just after tillage operation. The studied soil presents moderate roughness and unmarked tillage patterns and for a first approach, it can be modelled as isotropic Gaussian process [3]. In this paper, we propose a new approach of surface modelling and we show that the seedbed surface under consideration can be modeled by an initial surface on which clods and holes are laid down. One seedbed surface is studied here. We show that the contours of detected objects are well approximated by half-ellipsoid. From the large set of detected objects, we derive the statistical distributions characterizing orientation of ellipsoid, the major axis, the minor axis and the maximum altitude. The surface density of clods and holes is also evaluated and the interdependence of these parameters is analyzed. We propose a surface generation algorithm according to the statistical distributions. After removal of the structuring objects, a residue remains on the surface[4]. We show that the residu is not independent of the objet on the surface). We establish from this algorithm that the isotropy property depends on the probability law of the ellipse orientation. The influence of ellipse horizontal flattening factor is also investigated.

3000|$|In an acidic geochemical environment, SiO 2 (aq) that is {{released}} from feldspar dissolution can precipitate {{in the form}} of quartz overgrowths. In this study, the homogenization temperatures of the oil inclusions in the quartz overgrowths and the fillings of the feldspar-dissolved pores (such as SiO 2) mainly range from 88  °C to 110  °C, and the homogenization temperatures of paragenetic aqueous inclusions are about 115  °C, which suggest that the oil and aqueous inclusions formed simultaneously. This observation means that feldspar dissolution and early quartz overgrowth cementation occurred roughly during the same early period. Both carbonate cementation and quartz dissolution occur in an alkaline environment, so they may have formed during the same period. The replacement of feldspar overgrowths by ankerite (Appendix Fig. 8 G) suggests that the ankerite formed later than the feldspar overgrowths, whereas the ankerite and feldspar overgrowths both formed in an alkaline environment, which indicates that they are probably products from the same period. Strong asphalt cementation is typical in the reservoirs in the SPDZs of Es 4 x [...]. Many primary pores and various secondary pores (from the dissolution of feldspars, ankerite, quartz grains, and quartz overgrowths) are largely filled by asphalt (Appendix Fig. 8 H, 3 A, B, C, D, E, F). These textures suggest that asphalt formed very late, and many primary and secondary pores existed in the reservoirs before being filled with asphalt. For example, the thin section porosity of the asphalt in the reservoir at a depth of 4323.3  m in the Fengshen 1 well is approximately 10  %, and the porosity that was filled by asphalt may be 22  % according to the relationship between the thin section porosity and core porosity. Song et al. (2009 a) suggested that crude oil in the deep buried reservoirs in the Fengshen 1 well started to crack into gas and asphalt during the late depositional period of the Minghuazhen Formation. Li et al. (2010 a, b) proposed that the asphalt in the Fengshen 1 well was a product of oil pyrolysis when temperatures exceeded 160  °C. Additionally, Li et al. (2010 a, b) found that secondary pores in the feldspar grains were filled with asphalt, and tension fractures that are associated with the secondary pores were produced by overpressure from oil cracking (Appendix Fig. 8 H). The above analysis shows that the asphalt formed relatively late. Before being filled with asphalt, the reservoirs should have had high porosity, which indicates that the porosities were well preserved during deep burial. Pyrite cements developed extensively in the northern zone of the Minfeng Sag. Partial <b>cloddy</b> pyrites are products of early cementation (Appendix Fig. 9 G). Because mostly pyrite cements replaced quartz overgrowths (Appendix Fig. 8 E), feldspar overgrowths, and ankerite (Appendix Fig. 9 H), they should have formed during a late diagenetic stage. The textures of both the pyrite cements and asphalt suggest that they formed during the same period. During paragenesis with asphalt, pyrite {{is considered to be a}} reaction product of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) from crude oil cracking under high temperatures and Fe 2 + in reservoir fluids.|$|E
