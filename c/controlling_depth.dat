50|$|For general {{submersion}} or surfacing, submarines use {{the forward}} and aft tanks, called Main Ballast Tanks (MBT), which {{are filled with}} water to submerge or with air to surface. Submerged, MBTs generally remain flooded, which simplifies their design, and on many submarines these tanks are a section of interhull space. For more precise and quick <b>control</b> of <b>depth,</b> submarines use smaller <b>Depth</b> <b>Control</b> Tanks (DCT) - also called hard tanks (due {{to their ability to}} withstand higher pressure), or trim tanks. The amount of water in <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> tanks can be <b>controlled</b> to change <b>depth</b> or to maintain a constant depth as outside conditions (chiefly water density) change. <b>Depth</b> <b>control</b> tanks may be located either near the submarine's center of gravity, or separated along the submarine body to prevent affecting trim.|$|R
40|$|Visual {{tracking}} of free-swimming robotic fish remains {{a great challenge}} by considering imaging qualities in aquatic environments. In this paper, we propose a visual identification and positioning method to obtain accurate position for 3 -D tracking <b>control</b> comprising <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> and directional <b>control.</b> Specifically, a <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> method based on fuzzy sliding-mode control is put forward to make the robotic fish swim to the preferred target depth and remain at that <b>depth.</b> A directional <b>control</b> method with multiple stages is proposed, {{and a series of}} control strategies is developed to integrate agile locomotion and control accuracy. Experiments on <b>depth</b> <b>control</b> and 3 -D tracking control are finally conducted in an indoor pool. The latest results obtained indicate that the proposed algorithms are effective and feasible, which lays a solid foundation for complex underwater task execution...|$|R
50|$|In October 2006, the <b>controlling</b> <b>depth</b> was 5.2 ft, {{reaching}} 8.2 ft at mid-channel, in {{the entrance}} channel to {{the intersection of the}} east and west channels. From that area, thence 4.9 ft, reaching 8.3 ft at mid-channel, in the west channel leading to Terry and Johnson Coves, thence 6.9 ft, reaching 7.4 ft at mid-channel, in the east channel leading to Bayou St. John. The channels are well marked. A lighted whistle buoy off the entrance marks the approach.|$|E
5000|$|Submarines are larger, more {{sophisticated}} and have powerful underwater propulsion. They must travel horizontal distances submerged, require precise control of depth, yet do not descend so deeply, nor need to dive vertically on station. Their primary means of <b>controlling</b> <b>depth</b> are thus their diving planes, in combination with forward motion. At the surface the ballast tanks are emptied to give positive buoyancy. When diving, the tanks are partially flooded to achieve neutral buoyancy. The planes are then adjusted together to drive the hull downwards, whilst still level. For a steeper dive, the stern planes may be reversed and used to [...] the hull downwards.|$|E
5000|$|The largest deep lock at the Soo is the Poe Lock {{which is}} 1,200 ft long and 110 ft wide. Because of size restrictions, thirty vessels on the lakes can only pass between Lake Superior and Lake Huron using the Poe lock {{although}} none approaches the lock's size. Many lakers {{are restricted to}} the Lakes, being unable to navigate the St Lawrence Seaway whose locks allow a maximum vessel size of 740 ft in length or 78 ft in breadth. The shallow draft imposed by the rivers (the <b>controlling</b> <b>depth</b> is 27 ft in the St. Marys River and [...] in Lake Saint Clair) restricts the cargo capacity of Lakers, but that is partially recovered by their extra length and box design. Since Great Lakes waves never achieve the great length or period of ocean waves, particularly compared to the waves' height, ships are in less danger of being suspended between two waves and breaking, so the ratio between the ship's length, beam and its depth {{can be a bit}} larger than that of an ocean-going ship. The Lake vessels generally have a 10:1 length to beam ratio, whereas ocean vessels are typically 7:1. The dimension of locks is the determining factor in Lake vessel construction.|$|E

5000|$|The natural {{depth of}} the harbor is about 17 ft, but it was deepened over the years, to a <b>controlling</b> <b>depth</b> of about 24 ft in 1880. By 1891, the Main Ship Channel was {{minimally}} 30 ft deep. In 1914, Ambrose Channel became the main entrance to the port, at 40 ft deep and 2000 ft wide. During World War II the main channel was dredged to 45 ft deep to accommodate larger ships up to Panamax size. In 2016, the Army Corps of Engineers completed a $2.1 billion dredging project, deepening harbor channels to 50 ft {{in order to accommodate}} Post-Panamax container vessels, which can pass through the widened Panama Canal as well as the Suez Canal.This {{has been a source of}} environmental concern along channels connecting the container facilities in Port Newark to the Atlantic. PCBs and other pollutants lay in a blanket just underneath the soil. In June 2009 it was announced that 200,000 cubic yards of dredged PCBs would be [...] "cleaned" [...] and stored en masse at the site of the former Yankee Stadium and at Brooklyn Bridge Park. In many areas the sandy bottom has been excavated down to rock and now requires blasting. Dredging equipment then picks up the rock and disposes of it. At one point in 2005, there were 70 pieces of dredging equipment working to deepen channels, the largest fleet of dredging equipment anywhere in the world.|$|E
50|$|Navigation and Coast PilotThe Cohansey River is in Region 3 of the US Coast Guard and NOAA Mapping system. The {{following}} {{information is}} reproduced from the US government coast pilot information. This {{is from the}} 39th edition and {{may be out of}} data, so please do not use this for navigation: Cohansey River, which empties into the northeast side of Delaware Bay 31 miles northwestward of Cape May Light, is used mostly by pleasure craft, although some petroleum is transported to Bridgeton. Cohansey Light (39Â°20'30"N., 75Â°21'41"W.), 42 feet above the water, is shown from a black skeleton tower with a white daymark on the south side near the natural entrance. A dredged cut through the narrow neck of land on whichthe light stands gives a more direct approach to the river; the cut, 0.3 mile northwest of Cohansey Light, is marked on its west side by lights at the inner and outer ends. The river is unmarked above the dredged cut. In April 1990, the controlling depths were 5 feet to Fairton; thence in 1990-September 2003, shoaling to less than 1 foot to Bridgeton. The usual approach to Cohansey River is along theaxis of the dredged cut, but the natural channel eastward of Cohansey Light is sometimes used; the latter has a <b>controlling</b> <b>depth</b> of about 7 feet, and unmarked shoals with depths of 4 to 6 feet must be avoided on either side. Local knowledge is advised when using this approach and in the dredged channel in {{the upper part of the}} river off Bridgeton.|$|E
