5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2.

40|$|End of life {{care for}} people with {{advanced}} <b>chronic</b> <b>disease</b> is a growing international imperative, {{with the majority of}} deaths in the world now related to <b>chronic</b> <b>disease.</b> The provision of care that meets the needs of people with advanced <b>chronic</b> <b>disease</b> must be guided by appropriate policy. The key policy areas impacting directly on end of life care are related to <b>chronic</b> <b>disease,</b> palliative care and, increasingly, aged care. This paper describes the outcomes of an audit of Australian <b>chronic</b> <b>disease</b> and end of life/palliative care policies.

Lung cancer has overtaken all other types of cancer as {{the leading cause of}} cancer death in women, followed by breast cancer, colorectal, ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers. While smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing cancer is three times greater than amongst nonsmoking men.

Other important health issues for women include cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, osteoporosis and anemia. A major impediment to advancing women's health has been their underrepresentation in research studies, an inequity being addressed in the United States and other western nations by the establishment of centers of excellence in women's health research and large scale clinical trials such as the Women's Health Initiative.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Bangladesh {{suffers from}} a lack of {{healthcare}} providers. The growing <b>chronic</b> <b>disease</b> epidemic's demand for healthcare resources will further strain Bangladesh's limited healthcare workforce. Little is known about how Bangladeshis with <b>chronic</b> <b>disease</b> seek care. This study describes <b>chronic</b> <b>disease</b> patients' care seeking behavior by analyzing which providers diagnose these diseases. Methods During 2 month periods in 2009, a cross-sectional survey collected descriptive data on <b>chronic</b> <b>disease</b> diagnoses among 3 surveillance populations within the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR, B) network. The maximum number of respondents (over age 25) who reported having ever been diagnosed with a <b>chronic</b> <b>disease</b> determined the sample size. Using SAS software (version 8. 0) multivariate regression analyses were preformed on related sociodemographic factors. Results Of the 32, 665 survey respondents, 8, 591 self reported having a <b>chronic</b> <b>disease.</b> Chronically ill respondents were 63. 4 % rural residents. Hypertension was the most prevalent disease in rural (12. 4 %) and urban (16. 1 %) areas. In rural areas <b>chronic</b> <b>disease</b> diagnoses were made by MBBS doctors (59. 7 %) and Informal Allopathic Providers (IAPs) (34. 9 %). In urban areas <b>chronic</b> <b>disease</b> diagnoses were made by MBBS doctors (88. 0 %) and IAP (7. 9 %). Our analysis identified several groups that depended heavily on IAP for coverage, particularly rural, poor and women. Conclusion IAPs play important roles in <b>chronic</b> <b>disease</b> care, particularly in rural areas. Input and cooperation from IAPs are needed to minimize rural health disparities. More research on IAP knowledge and practices regarding <b>chronic</b> <b>disease</b> is needed to properly utilize this potential healthcare resource. </p...|$|R
