40|$|Collision-free {{transmission}} and efficient data transfer between nodes {{can be achieved}} {{through a set of}} channels in multichannel wireless sensor networks (MWSNs). While using multiple channels, we have to carefully consider channel interference, channel and time slot (resources) optimization, <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> delay, and energy consumption. Since sensor nodes operate on low battery power, the energy consumed in <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> becomes an important challenge. In this paper, we propose channel and time slot scheduling for minimal <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> in MWSNs, while achieving efficient and collision-free transmission between nodes.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on viewers’ <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> {{behaviour}} during prime-time television advertising breaks. While the extent of <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> has been studied repeatedly, the factors underlying channelswitching have not been extensively researched within a single study. To date, methodological limitations associated with self-reports, in-home cameras and electronic tracking data have restricted the scope for identifying the predictors of <b>channel</b> <b>switching.</b> The study makes use of a dual observation/survey methodological approach that has been largely overlooked in this area of research. This approach makes it possible to determine the influence of previously untested potential predictors of <b>channel</b> <b>switching.</b> The aim {{of this study is}} to determine the influence of six identified predictors on television viewers’ <b>channel</b> <b>switching.</b> The predictor variables tested include Perceived Clutter, Channel Proliferation, Attitude towards Television Advertising, Planned versus Impulse Viewing, Advertising Triggers and Remote Control Device (RCD) Empowerment. The last two predictors (Advertising Triggers and RCD Empowerment) result from factors drawn from a scale (SITUZAP) developed to measure the situational factors associated with <b>channel</b> <b>switching.</b> Moreover, the study determines the impact of these six predictor variables on observed <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> (observed PROPZAP) across 1, 283 observations as well as on reported <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> (reported PROPZAP) across 848 respondents. The empowerment provided by the RCD emerges as the dominant predictor of <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> behaviour. Access to the RCD as a means of controlling the viewing environment is the foremost influencer of both observed and reported propensity to <b>switch</b> <b>channels.</b> However, while reported switching propensity is influenced by ‘advertising triggers’ (for example, a repetitive or irritating commercial) and ‘perceived clutter’ (too much advertising on television), observed switching propensity is unaffected by these factors...|$|R

A consumer may be prompted to <b>switch</b> <b>channels</b> when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply {{because it is more}} convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|R
40|$|Wireless mesh {{networks}} (WMNs) {{have emerged}} as a promising technology for next generation wireless networking. A WMN extends network coverage using wireless mesh routers that {{communicate with each other}} via multi-hop wireless communications. One technique to increase the network capacity of WMNs is to use routers equipped with multiple radios capable of transmitting and receiving on multiple channels. In a Multi-Channel Multi-Radio wireless mesh network (MCMR WMN), nodes are capable of transmitting and receiving data simultaneously through different radios and at least theoretically doubling the average throughput. On the other hand, the use of multi-radio and multi-channel technology in many cases requires routers to <b>switch</b> <b>channels</b> for each transmission and/or reception. <b>Channel</b> <b>switching</b> incurs additional costs and delay. In this thesis, we present a simulation-based study of the impacts of <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> overheads on the performance of multicast in MCMR WMNs. We study how <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> overheads affect the performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, throughput, end-to-end delay, and delay jitter of a multicast session. In particular, we examine: 1. the performance of multicast in MCMR WMNs with three orthogonal channels versus eleven overlapping channels defined in IEEE 802. 11 b. 2. the performance of the Minimum-interference Multi-channel Multi-radio Multicast (M 4) algorithm with and without <b>channel</b> <b>switching.</b> 3. the performance of the Multi-Channel Minimum Number of Transmissions (MCMNT) algorithm (which does not do <b>channel</b> <b>switching)</b> in comparison with the M 4 algorithm (which performs <b>channel</b> <b>switching)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} dynamic <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> based on rank {{accounting}} so that WRAN systems can utilize channels effectively without strict coordination. In the proposed method, a base station in each WRAN cell has a ranking database where each rank denotes the usage frequency of channels. When {{the rank of}} a channel is high (low), the channel is (is not) used frequently for data transmission. Based on the ranking database, each WRAN cell utilizes an unused channel whose rank is high. Moreover, the proposed method utilizes the number of failures for <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> {{in order to avoid}} the collision. By using the proposed method, it is expected that WRAN cells can perform <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> with a small number of channels effectively. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by simulation, and we investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical examples show that the failure probability of <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> for the proposed method is almost zero. In addition, it is shown that the proposed method uses a small number of channels effectively. Keywords: cognitive radio, IEEE 802. 22, WRAN, <b>channel</b> <b>switching,</b> rank informatio...|$|R
40|$|Radio interference, whether {{intentional}} or otherwise, {{represents a}} serious threat to assuring the availability of sensor network services. As such, techniques that enhance the reliability of sensor communications in the presence of radio interference are critical. In this article, we propose to cope with this threat through a technique called channel surfing, whereby the sensor nodes in the network adapt their channel assignments to restore network connectivity in the presence of interference. We explore two different approaches to channel surfing: coordinated <b>channel</b> <b>switching,</b> in which the entire sensor network adjusts its channel; and spectral multiplexing, in which nodes in a jammed region <b>switch</b> <b>channels</b> and nodes on the boundary of a jammed region act as radio relays between different spectral zones. For coordinated <b>channel</b> <b>switching,</b> we examine an autonomous strategy where each node detects the loss of its neighbors in order to initiate <b>channel</b> <b>switching.</b> To cope with latency issues in the autonomous strategy, we propose a broadcast-assisted <b>channel</b> <b>switching</b> strategy to more rapidly coordinate <b>channel</b> <b>switching.</b> For spectral multiplexing, we have devised both synchronous and asynchronous strategies to facilitate the scheduling of nodes in order to improve network fidelity when sensor nodes operate on multiple channels.
