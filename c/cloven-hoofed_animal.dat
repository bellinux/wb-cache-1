40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) {{particles}} lose infectivity due {{to their}} disassembly at pH values slightly below neutrality. This acid-dependent disassembly process is required for viral RNA release inside endosomes. To study the molecular determinants of viral resistance to acid-induced disassembly, six FMDV variants with increased resistance to acid inactivation were isolated. Infection by these mutants was more sensitive to drugs that raise the endosomal pH (NH 4 Cl and concanamycin A) than was infection by the parental C-S 8 c 1 virus, confirming {{that the increase in}} acid resistance is related to a lower pH requirement for productive uncoating. Amino acid replacement N 17 D at the N terminus of VP 1 capsid protein was found in all six mutants. This single substitution was shown to be responsible for increased acid resistance when intro-duced into an infectious FMDV clone. The increased resistance of this mutant against acid-induced inactiva-tion was shown to be due to its increased resistance against capsid dissociation into pentameric subunits. Interestingly, the N 17 D mutation was located close to but not at the interpentamer interfaces. The mutants described here extend the panel of FMDV variants exhibiting different pH sensitivities and illustrate the adaptive flexibility of viral quasispecies to pH variations.

FMDV does not cross over or infect humans but is extremely infectious within <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>animals.</b> Foot and mouth disease 3C protease activity is responsible for the fragmentation of golgi apparatus and inhibition of microtubule regrowth. 3C protease activity is responsible for the loss of tethering of microtubules to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) region. Both of proteolytic effects on the host cell inhibit the transport of cellular proteins to the plasma membrane. This destruction of the secretory pathway reduces expression of major histocompatibility antigens at plasma membrane therefore slowing secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Hepatitis A 3C proteinase is a member of the cysteine proteases that are responsible for the infectivity and maturation of HAV. Hepatitis A 3C protease cleaves NEMO at the Q304 residue; NEMO is a NF-κB essential modulator responsible for activation of interferon (IFN) antiviral response. Cys24Ser (C24S) is a homolog of Hepatitis 3C proteinase, is responsible for inactivating Cys172 through alkylation of the sulfur at its active site. The sulfur alkylation of Cys172 causes inactivity while the N-alkylation of His102 causes a significant rise in enzymatic activity. Modification of enzymatic activity can be controlled by solution or crystallized N-iodoacetyl-valine-phenylalanine-amide (IVF). Therefore, IVF controls proteolytic inhibition through interactions with active site of enzyme.|$|R
