5|$|Also, because real tires have {{a finite}} <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> {{with the road}} surface that can {{generate}} a scrub torque, and when in a turn, can experience some side slipping as they roll, they can generate torques about an axis normal to {{the plane of the}} <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E
5|$|A {{measurement}} {{similar to}} trail, called either mechanical trail, normal trail, or true trail, is the perpendicular {{distance from the}} steering axis to the centroid of the front wheel <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b>|$|E
40|$|In fully plastic contact {{conditions}} where nominal {{contact pressure}} is relatively high, like in metal forming processes, individual summits join {{together to form}} <b>contact</b> <b>patches.</b> The geometry of these <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> depends on the contact pressure, which results in load-dependent frictional behaviour. This paper describes a model {{that takes into account}} this effect, and calculates contact and coefficient of friction in such conditions based on a good description of the shapes of <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> instead of individual summits. The results show that as the nominal contact pressure increases, the effect of surface topography becomes less significant while the effect of the interfacial shear strength remains important...|$|R
40|$|A new contact {{algorithm}} {{designed for}} multibody dynamics is presented. It {{is based on}} representation of the body surfaces by polygon meshes and contact force determination by the elastic foundation model. Areal discretisations of the <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> are constructed using methods closely related to computer graphics, e. g. collision detection based on bounding volume hierarchies and generation of subdivision surfaces by means of boundary representation data structures. Two examples prove the robustness of the method for complexly shaped bodies causing multiple and multiply bordered <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> and conforming <b>contacts...</b>|$|R
25|$|To {{straighten}} {{back out}} of the turn, the rider simply reverses the procedure for entering it: cause the bike to lean farther to the left; this causes it to steer farther to the left, which moves the wheel <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> farther to the left, eventually reducing the leftward lean and exiting the turn.|$|R
5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the <b>contact</b> <b>patch.</b> The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the <b>contact</b> <b>patch,</b> a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to {{one side or the other}} and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. Backwards motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body backwards while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
40|$|Contact {{between an}} elastic {{manifold}} and a rigid substrate with a self-affine fractal surface is reinvestigated with Green's function molecular dynamics. Stress and contact autocorrelation functions (ACFs) {{are found to}} decrease algebraically. A rationale is provided for the observed similarity in the exponents for stress and contact ACFs. Both exponents differ substantially from analytic predictions over the range of Hurst roughness exponents studied. The effect of increasing the range of interactions from a hard sphere repulsion to exponential decay is analyzed. Results for exponential interactions are accurately described by recent systematic corrections to Persson's contact mechanics theory. The relation between the area of simply connected <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> and the normal force is also studied. Below a threshold size the contact area and force are consistent with Hertzian contact mechanics, while area and force are linearly related in larger <b>contact</b> <b>patches.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
50|$|Motorcycle tyres (tires in American English) are {{the outer}} part of {{motorcycle}} wheels, attached to the rims, providing traction, resisting wear, absorbing surface irregularities, and allowing the motorcycle to turn via countersteering. The two tyres' <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> are the motorcycle's connection to the ground, and so are fundamental to the motorcycle's suspension behaviour, and critically affect safety, braking, fuel economy, noise, and rider comfort.|$|R

5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} approach is presented for the modeling of the thermomechanical interactions which occur in high speed sliding situations. These sliding contact problems which {{are characterized by}} active and interrelated thermal and mechanical phenomena could be called 'rub energetics' problems. Analytical models were developed to simulate two different rub situations: high energy braking of disk brakes and high speed rubs of gas path seals in turbine engines. The models proved to be particularly useful in predicting the severe temperatures and deformations near hot <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> on the rubbing surfaces. The size of the hot patches is generally determined by normal load and {{the properties of the}} contacting materials. Temperatures at the <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> can approach the melting point of the materials, especially at high sliding velocities. These high temperatures can lead to large amounts of near-surface deformation and high wear rates. Decreased contact temperatures can result from using materials with increased thermal conductivity and increased heat capacity or choosing mechanical properties (decreased stiffness, yield stress or coefficient of thermal expansion) which give larger hot spot size...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the single}} wheel {{is in the}} front (the [...] "delta" [...] form, as in a child's pedal tricycle), the vehicle is {{inherently}} unstable in a braking turn, as the combined tipping forces {{at the center of}} gravity from turning and braking can rapidly extend beyond the triangle formed by the <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> of the wheels. This type, if not tipped, also has a greater tendency to spin out ("swap ends") when handled roughly.|$|R
50|$|As {{the truck}} {{features}} a straight-axle arrangement, the TXT-1 is particularly adept at RC-scale rock crawling. In short, the straight-axle system allows the entire axle and chassis to better articulate itself over obstructions while efficiently conforming tire <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> to the ground. As an aside, the wide gear <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> and durable axle construction make the TXT-1 a very durable platform for either high-torque crawling applications or overall high-power brushed or brushless applications. The truck performs {{very well with}} no modifications required {{on a variety of}} surfaces, however some choose to lock differentials, change tire and wheel packages, reduce motor shaft-mounted pinion gear tooth count, mount the shock absorbers directly to the chassis and axle (thereby deleting the cantilever assembly), and reducing parts count and relocating electronic components to reduce weight and make the vehicle's weight distribution more advantageous for rock crawling. Advanced setups include cutting the lower portion of the chassis, changing the motor arrangement significantly (single motor setup with an external gear reduction unit), or changing the length of suspension links to modify caster angles and distances between axles and the chassis.|$|R

40|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} application proposed in this work is the occurrence of simultaneous <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> on a single wheel, i. e., the multi-point contact case.

500|$|The more trail a {{traditional}} bike has, the more stable it feels, although too much trail {{can make a}} bike feel difficult to steer.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose a simple way to {{formulate}} geometric contact formation to have an arbitrary intersection shape in a robotic (humanoid) posture generation problem. The contact shape is the outcome of our posture generator that is formulated as a non-linear optimization programming to fulfill a large variety of robot intrinsic limitations (e. g. joint and torque limits) and tasks (e. g. desired contact). Starting by defining convex areas of contact on the robot's body and the environment, that we call <b>contact</b> <b>patches,</b> we can generate contacts with arbitrary intersection of a pair of any of these predefined <b>patches.</b> Our geometric <b>contact</b> modeling writes very simply as additional constraints and variables added to the optimization problem, translating the search for an ellipse inscribed in the intersection of the pair of patches we want in contact. The result of our posture generator is then a configuration where <b>contact</b> <b>patches</b> are not necessarily included in one another. This allows our posture generator to propose contacts of different shapes with a non-predefined number of contact points (used later to compute reaction/contact forces). We illustrate the efficiency of our method in multi-contact posture generation with the HRP- 2 and ATLAS humanoid robots with results that can not be generated automatically by existing methods...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed which describes the oscillations of a railway wheelset running on rails. The eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the flexible system are calculated. Numerical problems arise in calculating the eigenvalues iteratively. These problems are outlined {{and it is}} shown how to overcome them. For realistic parameters the real parts of the calculated eigenvalues are negativ, i. e. the system is stable. Therefore instabilities can not explain the growth of corrugations on the rails or the wheels. An extension of the equations of motion leads {{to a set of}} evolution equations which permits to calculate the wear of the rails or the wheels. In this wear process the loss of mass is assumed to be proportional to the frictional power in the <b>contact</b> <b>patches.</b> The corresponding wear coefficients decrease due to hardening. The evolution equations for the wear coefficients are choosen as a simple phenomenological model which takes into account the instantaneous wear coefficient and the vertical forces in the <b>contact</b> <b>patches.</b> Numerical studies show that the wheels become noncircular. An explanation for the grumbling in the waggons of the ICE-trains is given. Many of the numerical results agree qualitatively with observations of rail corrugations.

2500|$|Lower {{extremity}} casts {{are classified}} similarly, with a cast encasing both the foot and the leg to the hip {{being called a}} long leg cast, while a cast encasing the patient's foot, ankle and lower leg ending below the knee {{is referred to as}} a short leg cast. A walking heel may be applied for ambulation. These heels, when properly applied, elevate the toes and offer the wearer the advantage of keeping the toes out of the dirt and moisture of the street. [...] The walking heel provides a small <b>contact</b> <b>patch</b> for the cast and creates a fluid rocking motion during the stride and allows the cast to pivot easily in any direction. Similarly, a cast shoe/cast boot/cast sandal may be provided to the patient to be used during ambulation of the immobilized limb during convalescence (referred to as being weight bearing). [...] Additionally, a castshoe may be used to simply protect the patient's casted foot while helping to maintain a higher degree of hygiene by preventing the cast from directly contacting potentially dirty or wet ground surfaces. [...] Where the patient is not to walk on the injured limb, crutches or a wheelchair may be provided. The foot's under-sole portion of a leg cast may be extended terminating {{at the tip of the}} patient's toes, to create a rigid support which limits motion of the metatarsals in both weight bearing and non-weight bearing leg casts. [...] These are referred to as toeplates in the orthopedic discipline of medicine. This addition may be applied to further support and stabilize the metatarsals by limiting motion through a higher degree of immobilization, as well as protecting the toes from additional blunt force trauma. Typically leg casts which incorporate a toeplate are prescribed for injuries to the foot and metatarsals. [...] Ordinarily, a leg cast applied for the treatment of a stable ankle fracture would not use the toeplate design because there is no need to immobilize and limit the motion of the patient's toes.|$|E

These tire deformation characteristics have given geometry shape of tire and material parameters of component parts of tire-casing. Nowadays the computational modeling is used for tire solutions and experiments are subsidiary only.
