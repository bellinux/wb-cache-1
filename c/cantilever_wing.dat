5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing,</b> of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section leading edge slat, a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|E

It features a <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing,</b> a T-tail, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, retractable monowheel gear with wing tip and tail casters, and a single electric motor in tractor configuration driving a folding propeller.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a twin engine conventional geared mid-winged monoplane. Its primary feature was its corrugated metal construction, {{a new technique}} and different from the tube-and-fabric airplanes of the time. In addition, the internally supported <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing</b> developed for the Stout Batwing was employed. The {{aircraft was}} test flown successfully, however,the airplane showed signs of inadequate longitudinal stability.|$|E
25|$|The MC {{design was}} based on the general shape of the CT series, but {{rendered}} in metal and with a strut-braced wing, in place of the CT series' composite construction and <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing.</b> The design goal was to provide a more robust design, primarily for flight school use. The resulting MC has a lower cruise speed as well as less payload and range than the comparable Flight Design CTLW.|$|E

25|$|The T.K.2 was {{designed}} as a high speed tourer, under the leadership of Marcus Langley, the school's instructor in design. It was a single-engined, two-seat low <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing</b> monoplane, with an enclosed cockpit and fixed spatted undercarriage. It first flew on 16 August 1935 at Hatfield Aerodrome, piloted by Hubert S. Broad, and powered by a 147hp (110kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major inverted inline engine. Subsequently, for racing purposes, the passenger seat was usually replaced with an additional fuel tank.|$|E
25|$|The Hawk is an {{advanced}} trainer with a two-man tandem cockpit, a low-mounted <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing</b> and {{is powered by}} a single turbofan engine. Unlike many of the previous trainers in RAF service, the Hawk was specifically designed for training. Hawker had developed the aircraft to have a high level of servicability, as well as lower purchasing and operating costs than previous trainers like the Jet Provost. The Hawk has been praised by pilots for its agility, in particular its roll and turn handling.|$|E
25|$|The Tornado borrows {{from the}} design of the Earthstar Thunder Gull J and shares a similar <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing</b> of small area, keeping stall speeds low by use of flaps. This low drag design manages high cross country speeds as a result. The cockpit is {{constructed}} from 4130 steel, while the fuselage boom tube and the wings are built from aluminium. Unlike the Gull's wing, which is aircraft fabric-covered or optionally finished in sheet aluminium, the Tornado's wing is stressed skin. The Tornado has a tricycle undercarriage with a supplemental tailwheel castor, as the aircraft sits on its tail when unoccupied.|$|E
25|$|The Batwing was {{designed}} with an unusually broad chord, thick section <b>cantilevered</b> <b>wing</b> with the horizontal stabilizers set {{very close to}} the rear of the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The 2-32 is all-metal, with a {{semi-monocoque}} aluminum fuselage and <b>cantilever</b> <b>wings</b> of 57 foot (17.37 m) span. It has top-and-bottom divebrakes and an all-flying stabilator tail.|$|R
50|$|The company {{built the}} Christmas Bullet scout {{aircraft}} for the Cantilever Aero Company. Both prototypes suffered structural failure of their thin <b>cantilevered</b> <b>wings,</b> killing test pilots Cuthbert Mills and Allington Jolly.|$|R
25|$|The M 20 was {{designed}} by Willy Messerschmitt at Bayerische Flugzeugwerke, primarily for use with Luft Hansa which had ordered two {{in advance of the}} first flight. It was a development of the BFW M.18d eight-seater, equipped with a single 375kW (500hp) upright inline water-cooled BMW VIa engine. It had a high, <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing</b> based around a robust D-section box formed from a single dural spar and dural skin, forward to the leading edge. The fuselage was all-metal, with a mostly dural frame, covered with metal sheeting providing rectangular cross-section accommodation, with four square windows each side, for eight passengers. The single-axle main undercarriage was strutted vertically to the wing.|$|E
25|$|The Miles M.15 {{was built}} in {{response}} to Air Ministry specification T.1/37 which called for a two-seat basic trainer. Two other aircraft manufacturers also built contenders: Parnall Aircraft provided the Heck 3 and Heston Aircraft their Heston T.1/37. The Airspeed AS.36, General Aircraft GAL.32 and Percival P.20 were also proposed against specification T.1/37, but not built. At first sight, the M.15 looked rather like the earlier Miles Magister, a low <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing</b> monoplane with tandem open cockpits and a fixed, spatted main undercarriage plus tailwheel, powered by a single inverted de Havilland Gipsy series in-line engine. Despite this, the two types differed significantly in powerplant, form and construction.|$|E
25|$|The Hawk 200 is a single-seat, {{single engine}} light multirole fighter {{with a small}} visual {{signature}} and high manoeuvrability. It has a low-mounted <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing</b> and {{is powered by a}} single turbofan engine. The Hawk 200 differs from the earlier Hawks {{in the sense that it}} has a new forward fuselage whereby the forward cockpit area which normally houses a pilot is replaced by an electronics bay for avionics and onboard systems, including a fire control computer, multi-mode radar, laser rangefinder and forward-looking infrared (FLIR). The Hawk 200 also has an upgraded wing, which in addition to four wing pylons seen in previous Hawks, also has wingtip missile support as well as greater wing area, increased wing droop, larger flaps and an optional mid-air refueling capability.|$|E
5000|$|The Acrobat is an {{all-metal}} monoplane with <b>cantilever</b> <b>wings</b> and a strut-braced tailplane. It has a fixed {{landing gear}} with a steerable tailwheel and {{is powered by}} a [...] AOOT M-14P radial piston engine.|$|R
5000|$|The Piel CP.80 Zephir (or Zef), Piel CP.801 and Piel CP.802 {{are racing}} {{aircraft}} developed in France in the 1970s and marketed for homebuilding. They are compact, single-seat, single-engine monoplanes with low, <b>cantilever</b> <b>wings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Tecnam P2004 Bravo is a high-wing, light {{aircraft}} {{built by the}} Tecnam aircraft company. It {{is similar to the}} Tecnam P92 Echo Super, but has a <b>cantilevered</b> <b>wing</b> rather than the P92's strut-braced wing.|$|R
25|$|Initially, the {{structure}} of the Hurricane's <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing</b> consisted of two steel spars, which possessed considerable strength and stiffness. The wing was described by aviation publication Flight as being relatively straightforward to manufacture, employing simple vertical jigs to attach the two spars, after which the wing ribs would be installed using horizontal bolts, forming separate units between the front and rear spars. Hydraulically-actuated split trailing edge flaps were present on the inner end of the wings. The original wing was predominantly fabric-covered, like the fuselage, while some use of lightweight metal sheets was made upon the exterior surface of the inner wing and its leading edge. The majority of the Flight control surfaces, such as the Frise-type ailerons, also had fabric coverings.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} bombers {{had a slight}} {{performance}} advantage over fighters due to having multiple engines and streamlined, but heavy, <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing</b> designs, so a successful interception would require careful planning to bring interceptor aircraft into a suitable defensive position {{in front of the}} bombers. Before World War II and the invention of radar, detection systems were visual or auditory, which gave only a few minutes' warning. Against World War I designs these systems were marginally useful, but against 1930s aircraft flying at twice their speed or more, they did not provide enough time to arrange interception missions. This balance of force meant that bombs would be falling before the fighters were in position and there was little that could be done about it. For Britain, the answer was to concentrate on bomber production, primarily as a deterrent force.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve the}} desired long range, the PBB became a fairly large aircraft, with a {{wingspan}} of 139 feet 8½ inches (42.59 m) and a crew of ten. Despite its size, it was powered by just two Wright R-3350 Duplex Cyclone radial engines, driving three-bladed Curtiss Electric propellers. It was the largest twin-engined flying boat flown during World War II. For a flying boat, the PBB was aerodynamically clean, with a <b>cantilever</b> <b>wing</b> set high on the fuselage. The planing bottom had a single step, and the non-retractable outrigger floats were attached to streamlined, cantilever struts. The lower hull was divided with seven watertight compartments, and a short upper deck provided seating for the cockpit crew. The wing of the PBB was constructed in a center section and two outer panels. The center section carried the engine nacelles and contained the internal bomb bays, as well as fuel and oil tanks. The outer wing panels contained main and auxiliary, integral fuel tanks.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical {{investigation of the}} flutter of sweptback <b>cantilever</b> <b>wings</b> is reported. The experiments employed groups of wings swept back by rotating and by shearing. The angle of sweep range from 0 degree to 60 degrees and Mach numbers extended to approximately 0. 85. A theoretical analysis of the air forces on an oscillating swept wing of high length-chord ratio is developed, and the approximations inherent in the assumptions are discussed. Comparison with experiment indicates that the analysis developed in the present report is satisfactory for giving the main effects of sweep, at least for nearly uniform <b>cantilever</b> <b>wings</b> of high and moderate length-chord ratios...|$|R
50|$|This canard glider {{followed}} the design {{philosophy of the}} FVA-1 and FVA-2, with similar <b>cantilevered</b> <b>wings</b> and trousered undercarriage skids, but used a controllable foreplane for stability and control in the pitch and yaw axes. One built.|$|R
