50|$|On 2 March 1965, K-159 {{suffered}} an accident involving radioactive discharges into her steam generators, almost certainly primary <b>coolant</b> <b>leaks</b> from the tubes into the steam chest and thence into the turbines, contaminating her entire propulsion plant.

She returned to the shipyard from 1970 through 1972 for further repairs and refuelling, and then again from 1979 through 1980 for still more repairs.|$|E
5000|$|In 1957, NATO had {{specified}} that its forces should use multi-fuel engines.

This was further {{hampered by the}} Horstmann coil spring suspension, which made it a challenge to drive cross country and provide the crew with a comfortable ride. Due to the cylinder linings being pressure fitted, <b>coolant</b> <b>leaks</b> within the cylinder block were common, resulting in white smoke billowing from the exhaust.|$|E

50|$|Designed in 1924 as a {{military}} successor to the Curtiss D-12, initially named the Conqueror, it was later given the military designation of V-1570 based on its displacement of 1,570 cubic inches (26 L). The engine featured open-ended cylinder liners (advanced technology for the period) and pressurized liquid cooling. Developments {{including the use of}} a supercharger gradually increased power output until reliability problems due to overheating and <b>coolant</b> <b>leaks</b> became apparent. Military funding for further development of the Conqueror was cut in 1932, efforts by Curtiss to market the engine for civil airliners failed and the line was dropped from production.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{affected}} by an oil sludge problem and premature timing chain tensioner failure, which were fixed around 2002-2004. The oil sludge issue {{appears to have been}} caused by issues with the crankcase ventilation system, and while it affected a minority of engines, it could cause complete failure In some cases, neglected maintenance aided in premature failure (missed oil changes or increased intervals between oil changes). Also this engine was plagued with issues regarding the water pump gasket leaking coolant internally and diluting the oil. Such <b>coolant</b> <b>leaks</b> must be addressed instantly or engine failure is imminent.|$|E

500|$|On January 5, 2012, General Motors {{announced}} that it would offer a customer-satisfaction program to provide modifications to the Chevrolet Volt to reduce the chance that the battery pack could catch fire days or weeks after a severe accident. The carmaker described the modifications as voluntary enhancements and stated that neither the car nor the battery was being recalled. General Motors determined the June fire {{was the result of a}} minor intrusion from a portion of the vehicle into a side section of the battery pack. This intrusion resulted in a small <b>coolant</b> <b>leak</b> inside the battery of approximately [...] When the vehicle was put through a slow roll, where it was rotated at 90-degree increments, holding in each position for about five minutes, an additional [...] of <b>coolant</b> <b>leaked.</b> With the vehicle in the 180 degrees position (upside down), the coolant came in contact with the printed circuit board electronics at the top of the battery pack and later crystallized. Three weeks later this condition, in combination with a charged battery, led to a short circuit that resulted in the post-crash fire.|$|R
50|$|Yak-9 {{armed with}} a 37 mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-37 cannon with 30 rounds instead of the 20 mm ShVAK, cockpit moved 0.4 m (1 ft 3 in) back to {{compensate}} for the heavier nose. Initially poor quality control led to multiple oil and <b>coolant</b> <b>leaks</b> from cannon recoil. Recoil and limited supply of ammunition required accurate aiming and two-three round bursts. Yak-9T was widely used against enemy shipping on the Black Sea and against tanks, but was also successful against aircraft with a single cannon hit usually sufficient to tear apart the target. Virage (constant altitude and velocity turn) time: 18-19 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Finally, other {{concerns}} may dominate cooling system design. As example, air {{is a relatively}} poor coolant, but air cooling systems are simple, and failure rates typically rise as {{the square of the}} number of failure points. Also, cooling capacity is reduced only slightly by small air <b>coolant</b> <b>leaks.</b> Where reliability is of utmost importance, as in aircraft, it may be a good trade-off to give up efficiency, longevity (interval between engine rebuilds), and quietness in order to achieve slightly higher reliability; the consequences of a broken airplane engine are so severe, even a slight increase in reliability is worth giving up other good properties to achieve it.|$|E
50|$|Coastal {{facilities}} {{were treated with}} much less attention than the submarines and often turned out unable to heat the submarines reactors. Consequently the plants had to be kept running even while the subs were in harbor. The facilities completely broke down early in the 1980s and since then the reactors of all operational Lira submarines were kept constantly running. While the BM-40A reactors are able to work for many years without stopping, they were not specifically designed for such treatment and any serious reactor maintenance became impossible. This led {{to a number of}} failures, including <b>coolant</b> <b>leaks</b> and one reactor broken down and frozen while at sea. However, constantly running the reactors proved better than relying on the coastal facilities. Four vessels were decommissioned due to freezing of the coolant.|$|E

5000|$|The major {{disadvantage}} to {{porous reactor}} fuel {{is that the}} entire primary cooling loop including all the pumps, compressors and heat exchangers would become highly contaminated with fission products. [...] Contamination caused by a potential contaminated <b>coolant</b> <b>leak</b> would pose a significant danger to personnel and the environment. The high contamination level precludes being able to open the reactor vessel for the eventual refueling. Therefore, the reactor was designed for remote online refuelling.|$|R
40|$|Coolant leakage {{leads to}} {{decrease}} in performance during {{the operation of}} electric vehicles which make use of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). This study examines the effects of various <b>coolant</b> <b>leak</b> conditions in 3 -cell stack and single cell. The experimental results show that an irreversible reduction in performance occurs after coolant injection into the anode side of the stack. Poisoning of carbon monoxide (CO) on the platinum (Pt) catalyst is caused by electro-oxidation reaction of EG. Water cleaning is selected because CO poisoning is desorbed to reaction with water molecules. Performance is quickly reduced when the interval between coolant injections is short. Performance reduction is indicated by the experimental results for the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). It shows that performance of the MEA with the GDL exposed to coolant decreased, but it is recovered after water cleaning. In contrast, results for performance of the MEA exposed to coolant for long time could not be reversed after water cleaning. Therefore, we propose that performance degradation of <b>coolant</b> <b>leak</b> on the Pt catalyst surface and GDL can be recovered by the water cleaning simply without disassembly of stack. close...|$|R
