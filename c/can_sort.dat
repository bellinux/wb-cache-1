One notable {{feature of the}} SIII's music player is Music Square, which analyses a song's intensity and ranks the song by mood so that the user can play songs according to their current emotional state. The device also introduced Music Hub, an online music store powered by 7digital with a catalogue of over 19million songs.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust oneâ€™s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they <b>can</b> <b>sort</b> cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E

Under reasonable assumptions at least 500 GB of data <b>can</b> be <b>sorted</b> using 1 GB of main memory before a third pass becomes advantageous, and many times that much data <b>can</b> be <b>sorted</b> before a fourth pass becomes useful. Low-seek-time media like solid-state drives (SSDs) also increase the amount that <b>can</b> be <b>sorted</b> before additional passes improve performance.|$|R

Trixie and Lou later marry. Nina returns a year later after {{becoming}} an actress in Bollywood. She goes to see Jack and tells him that she wants to be with him. She also visits Lou and gives him some money, as Trixie had left him bankrupt. Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) tells Nina that Jack needs to stay in Australia so he <b>can</b> <b>sort</b> himself out. Nina performs her last concert at Lou's Place, and she tells Jack that she will wait for him. Months later, Jack flies out to Los Angeles to be with Nina.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 4S {{can play}} music, movies, {{television}} shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and <b>can</b> <b>sort</b> its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations.

Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the 4S, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.|$|E

Since then, there has been much work on similar problems of sorting data streams by more general systems of stacks and queues. In the system considered by , each element from an input data stream must be pushed onto one of several stacks. Then, once all of the data has been pushed in this way, the items are popped from these stacks (in an appropriate order) onto an output stream. As Chung et al. observe, a given permutation can be sorted by this system if and only if a certain graph, derived from the permutation, has a book embedding with the vertices in a certain fixed order along the spine and with a number of pages that is at most equal to the number of stacks.|$|E

Allison Stewart from The Washington Post further expanded on this view, stating that [...] "without the slightest hint of noblesse oblige" [...] to Gaga, [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is a synthy, [...] "burbly slip" [...] of a song. Eliot Glazer of MTV Buzzworthy stated that the song seems to continue right where Lopez's 1999 hit single [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] left off, [...] "making us want to put on our short shorts and dance".
