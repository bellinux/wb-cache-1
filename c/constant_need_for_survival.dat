40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{proposal}} for a new graveyard on Ust at Kattem in Trondhjem. Graveyard as a subject, is appealing to work with because graveyards are considered something eternal, but they are constantly changing. For every new way we bury, we think we’ve found the ultimate way, just to discover something “even better” next time. So how can one plan a graveyard to meet people’s needs in the future? There are three needs that will always be most important for the graveyard to fulfil, regardless of time and expression. According to Sven Ingvar Anderson (1995) these are: <b>Constant</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> consolation <b>Constant</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> eternity And <b>constant</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> dignity There are many different tombs to choose from to accommodate these three needs. All graveyards solve this in their own way, and here is a selection of various parts from eight project examples that show different solutions. These have been of great use and inspiration in the design part of this thesis. The result is a framework for a graveyard, where the rooms within change over time. Each room can be customized to contain the most popular tomb-type as it is taken into use. The <b>need</b> <b>for</b> consolation, eternity and dignity is taken care of through the vegetation grip and how it evolves over time...|$|R

In this way, we find a method for calculating c_V that gives smaller errors than that used previously. Where possible, we compare our results with those of the ALPHA collaboration (who use the Schrödinger functional) and with 1 -loop tadpole-improved perturbation theory...|$|R
