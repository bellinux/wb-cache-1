40|$|In {{an age of}} {{a flourishing}} {{emphasis}} on sports and a high frequency of individual record breaking, {{a detailed description of}} performance trends would provide a better understanding of what might happen in the future. In this study, world records in swimming and athletics were analyzed to relate the time of occurrence to their magnitude in order to predict future record performances. Records were considered from 1945, or the earliest date after 1945, to 1977 and subjected to a time-series analysis (Box-Jenkins method) to determine predicted values for 1978 through 1984. Predictions and their confidence limits were developed for all events. A 5 % error rate was considered as the widest acceptable degree of error. Only some track events fell within this <b>criterion</b> <b>range</b> and therefore, contained adequate predictions. Swimming and field events were mainly unacceptable in light of the predictions which were made. Several variables affecting predictions were discussed. Otherwise the prediction of world record performance trends in swimming, track, and field was found to be unsatisfactory when world records served as source data...|$|E
40|$|We {{assess the}} impact of swath width on the {{statistics}} of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrieved by satellite, as inferred from observations made by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Using collocated AERONET sun photometer observations we develop a correction to the MODIS data to account for calibration and algorithmic view angle dependency in the retrieved AOT. We sub-sample and correct the AOT data from the MODIS Aqua instrument along several candidate swaths of various widths for the years 2003 – 2011. We find that over ocean the global, annual mean AOT is within &plusmn; 0. 01 of the full swath AOT for all of our sub-samples. Over land, however, most of our sub-samples are outside of this <b>criterion</b> <b>range</b> in the global, annual mean. Moreover, at smaller spatial and temporal scales we find wide deviation in the sub-sample AOT relative to the full swath over both land and ocean. In all, the sub-sample AOT is within &plusmn; 0. 01 of the full swath value less than 25 % of the time over land, and less than 50 % of the time over ocean (less than 35 % for all but the widest of our sub-sample swaths). These results suggest that future aerosol satellite missions having only narrow swath views may not sample the true AOT distribution sufficiently to reduce significantly the uncertainty in aerosol direct forcing of climate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Four global algorithms, maximum {{likelihood}} (ML), sum of adjacent LOD score (SALOD), sum of adjacent recombinant fractions (SARF) and product of adjacent recombinant fraction (PARF), and one approx-imation algorithm, seriation (SER), {{were used to}} compare the marker ordering efficiencies for correctly given linkage groups based on doubled haploid (DH) popula-tions. The Monte Carlo simulation results indicated the marker ordering powers for the five methods were almost identical. High correlation coefficients were greater than 0. 99 between grouping power and ordering power, indicating that all these methods for marker ordering were reliable. Therefore, the main problem for linkage analysis was how to improve the grouping power. Since the SER approach provided the advantage of speed without losing ordering power, this approach was used for detailed simulations. For more generality, multiple link-age groups were employed, and population size, linkage cutoff criterion, marker spacing pattern (even or uneven), and marker spacing distance (close or loose) were considered for obtaining acceptable grouping powers. Simulation results indicated that the grouping power was related to population size, marker spacing distance, and cutoff criterion. Generally, a large population size provided higher grouping power than small population size, and closely linked markers provided higher grouping power than loosely linked markers. The cutoff <b>criterion</b> <b>range</b> for achieving acceptable grouping power and ordering power differed for varying cases; however, combining all situations in this study, a cutoff criterion ranging from 50 cM to 60 cM was recommended for achieving acceptable grouping power and ordering power for different cases...|$|E

The driver for this exercise is Article 50. 3 of EC-Regulation 1698 / 2005 calling for the revision of the existing system based on criteria related to low soil productivity and poor climate conditions for agriculture. FAO¿s agricultural problem land approach was selected and adjusted {{to come forward with}} the requested approach.

Two climatic and four soil criteria were retained and complemented by one integrated soil-climate criterion (soil water balance), with slope as the sole topographic criterion. For each criterion two critical limits were defined dividing the <b>criterion</b> <b>range</b> into three sub-ranges: not limiting, severely limiting and very severely limiting for agriculture. The criteria and the associated critical limits or threshold values can be used anywhere to discriminate land with biophysical constraints to agricultural production on the basis that soil and climate data of sufficient spatial and semantic detail are available. Whereas such datasets are held at regional and national levels, Pan-European soil and climate data sets also exist to which the criteria and threshold values can be applied.

40|$|The article dwells {{on issues}} of {{modeling}} electromagnetic fields levels (EMF with frequency equal to 300 KMHz - 300 MHz which are created by television and radio broadcasting objects, radiolocation, and mobile communication in a large regional cen-ter, in geoinformation system environment. Our task was to estimate EMF levels on areas where apartment blocks were located; to assess energy flows at various floors, to determine zones in a city as per EMF levels; to verify the obtained results with the direct factor measuring. Our calculation included data on 2, 011 EMF sources located on a city territory. We allowed for bulk parameters of 31, 949 buildings including 17, 307 apartment blocks, 3, 160 administrative buildings, 307 pre-school children facilities and 105 secondary schools. We performed our calculations in city coordinate system at 109 thousand points. Each calculation created a picture of EMF spread in a plane at a set height which allowed us to determine exposure level at a control point as per "slice" re-sults and {{to build up a}} 3 D contamination model. Approximately 80 % of all the calculated results had EMF parameters within 0. 1 - 10 safety <b>criterion</b> <b>range.</b> We spotted zones with maximum calculated EMF levels at 18 - 25 meters. Instrumental research proved high factor levels in these zones including those where levels exceeded safety criterion 4 - 6 times; it makes for certain vigilance in judgments on environmental safety for people who live on the examined territory permanently. The obtained data can be used for foundation of instrumental research points within the frameworks of specific research or social-hygienic monitoring as well as for consequent exposure and health risk assessment.

The driver for this exercise is Article 50. 3 of ECRegulation 1698 / 2005 calling for the revision of the existing system based on criteria related to low soil productivity and poor climate conditions for agriculture and the consequent Communication from the Commission: "Towards a better targeting of the aid to farmers in areas with natural handicaps" of 21 Apr. 2011. The FAO’s agricultural problem land approach was selected and adjusted {{to come forward with}} the policy requirement. The FAO approach was deemed appropriate because it is not crop-specific and for its simple assumptions regarding the mutual interaction of land characteristics on the overall suitability of the land, making it applicable for a territory as large and diverse as the EU 27. Two climatic and four soil criteria were retained and complemented by one integrated soil-climate criterion (Excess soil moisture – Field Capacity duration), with slope as the sole topographic criterion. For each criterion a critical limit was defined dividing the <b>criterion</b> <b>range</b> into two categories: not limiting and severely limiting for agriculture. The criteria and the associated critical limits or threshold values have been tested by Member States of the European Union. Feedbacks and suggestions from Member States simulations have been taken into account to update the initial list of bio-physical criteria so that the applicability is ensured in EU 27. Therefore, they can be used in Member States to discriminate land with biophysical constraints to agricultural production on the basis that soil and climate data have sufficient spatial and semantic details.

A questionnaire was used to collect the perception of ninety seven investors who have conducted businesses in Temanggung Regency area, and thirteen employees Temanggung Regency. The number of sample is determined using the Slovin formula. Investor respondents are determined using stratified random sampling non proportional, and Temanggung Regency’s employees respondents are determined using purposive sampling method. Three analytical tools were used in this study, including (1) <b>criterion</b> <b>range</b> analysis, (2) importance-performance analysis, and (3) independent sample T-test. A comprehensive analysis of the output of the three methods concludes that the Temanggung Regency need to concern about twenty four factors and its managerial implications in order to attract investors. Those factors are environmental security, tax incentives, national security, the availability of raw materials, the continuity of raw material supply, deregulation on business registration, the stability of raw material price, energy facility, telecommunication facility, banking facility, tax incentive, industrial area facility, business area facility, citizen as target market, competitor information, the company position in the industry, office area facility, the enforcement of copy right, market facility, investment regulation, land usage regulation, product price regulation, tax services, sea transportation facility, and air transportation facility.
