40|$|Objectives: Nearly {{one-third of}} {{healthcare}} costs are potentially avoidable {{and would not}} compromise medical care if eliminated. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the financial impact of reduction in use of creatinine kinase (CK) -MB and myoglobin tests after removing them from the <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzyme</b> order set at a community hospital. Methods: Grand rounds were held, and an email notification was sent to de-emphasize the use of CK, CK-MB, myoglobin, SGOT (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase), and SGPT (serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) work up. The above tests {{were removed from the}} pre-checked <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzyme</b> order set in the computerized physician order entry on February 13, 2014. The tests continued to be available, but needed to be ordered individually. The mean monthly volume of <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzyme</b> tests for 12 months after this intervention was compared with the mean monthly volume of 12 months before the change. Total cost savings were calculated. Results: After the intervention, the number of CK, CK-MB, myoglobin, SGOT, and SGPT tests utilized for ACS workup decreased dramatically (p< 0. 001). The volume of troponin testing remained the same (p= 0. 283). The total annual savings of billable charges to healthcare payers was $ 463, 744. 7. Conclusions: Removal of CK-MB, myoglobin, CK, SGOT, and SGPT tests from <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzyme</b> order sets can successfully reduce unnecessary laboratory testing for ACS workup, leading to significant cost savings to the healthcare system...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAortic {{dissection}} is {{a critical}} condition requiring immediate assessment and management. Clinical presentation is commonly associated with severe chest pain and high blood pressure. However, misdiagnosis is frequent because of various features. We presented a case of 51 -year-old woman who complained of dyspnea for 3 d after she experienced back pain for one week. She was presented with severe respiration distress with impending respiration failure on arrival to our hospital. Her chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with acute pulmonary edema. The laboratory data revealed elevated <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzyme</b> and electrocardiography demonstrated sinus tachycardia. She was hospitalized under the initial diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. The patient remained hemodynamically stable, and experienced one episode of chest discomfort. After electrocardiography, she was found with bigeminy ventricular premature beats without ST-T change.

40|$|Acute myocardiopathy in {{experimental}} dogs and rabbits was induced by subcutaneous (SQ) injection of 3. 5 mg/kg of scorpion venom from Mesobuthus tamulus concanesis, Pocock. An increase in circulating lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (SGOT), creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB), serum glutamine pyrovate transaminase (SGPT) and alpha hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH) enzyme levels {{was observed in}} dogs 60 min after venom injection, and a further rise was observed 120 min after venom injection. The administration of the species-specific scorpion antivenom (SAV) at different time intervals after venom injection resulted in reversal of electrocardiographic changes {{and a reduction in}} <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzyme</b> levels. The administration of SAV to scorpion envenomed alloxan-pretreated animals did not cause clinical or biochemical improvement. On the other hand, administering insulin to envenomed only animals or envenomed alloxan-pretreated animals resulted in a biochemical and clinical improvement, as well as in a reduction of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzyme</b> levels. Insulin administration in scorpion envenoming syndrome is essentially a metabolic support to control the adverse effects triggered by catecholamines and other counter-regulatory hormones...|$|R

50|$|In short, {{the main}} {{criteria}} for the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy are: the patient must have experienced a stressor before the symptoms began to arise; the patient’s ECG reading must show abnormalities from a normal heart; the patient must not show signs of coronary blockage or other common causes of heart troubles; the levels of <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzymes</b> in the heart must be elevated or irregular; and the patient must recover complete contraction and be functioning normally in {{a short amount of}} time.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{availability}} of antitoxin and antibiotics, the mortality rate for diphtheria remains high, mostly because of cardiac complications. METHODS: During 1 year, 154 Vietnamese children with diphtheria admitted to a referral hospital were studied prospectively with clinical examination, including a simple pseudomembrane score, 12 -lead and 24 -hour electrocardiography, measurement of serum <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzyme</b> levels, and estimation of troponin T levels. RESULTS: Thirteen children had diphtheritic cardiomyopathy on admission, and 19 developed it subsequently. Twelve children (8 %) died. The combination of pseudomembrane score of > 2 and bull neck predicted the development of diphtheritic cardiomyopathy, with a positive predictive value of 83 % and a negative predictive value of 93 %. Administration of 24 -hour electrocardiography on admission improved the ability to predict diphtheritic cardiomyopathy by 57 %. Fatal outcome was best predicted by the combination of myocarditis on admission and a pseudomembrane score of > 2. Of the <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzyme</b> levels measured, an elevated aspartate aminotransferase level was the best predictor. The presence of troponin T identified additional children with subclinical cardiac damage.

The enzyme is inhibited by aprotinin, antipain, leupeptin and by high concentrations of soybean trypsin inhibitor, but stimulated by lima-bean or ovomucoid trypsin inhibitor and low concentrations of soybean trypsin inhibitor. By using a specific monoclonal antibody to tissue kallikrein in Western blot as well as active-site labelling with [14 C]di-isopropyl fluorophosphate, the <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzyme</b> {{was identified as a}} protein of 38 kDa, a molecular mass identical with that of tissue kallikrein. Immunocytochemistry at the electron-microscopic level localized this enzyme to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and granules of rat atrial myocytes. Two cardiac kallikrein precursors, (38 and 40 kDa) were identified from the translation in vitro of heart mRNA by immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis of [35 S]methionine-labelled cell-free translation products. Kallikrein mRNA in the rat heart was also demonstrated by dot-blot analysis using a tissue kallikrein cDNA probe.

50|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) {{refers to}} tissue death (infarction) {{of the heart}} muscle (myocardium).

Unlike other causes of acute coronary syndromes, such as unstable angina, a myocardial infarction occurs when there is cell death, as measured by a blood test of <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzymes</b> such as troponin or CK-MB.

50|$|Cardiac markers or <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzymes</b> are {{proteins}} that leak out of injured myocardial cells through their damaged cell membranes into the bloodstream.

The cardiac troponins T and I which are released within 4-6 hours of an attack of MI and remain elevated for up to 2 weeks, have nearly complete tissue specificity and are now the preferred markers for assessing myocardial damage.Heart-type fatty acid binding protein is another marker, used in some home test kits.Elevated troponins in the setting of chest pain may accurately predict a high likelihood of a myocardial infarction in the near future.

40|$|Background: Patients {{undergoing}} percutaneous coronary intervention are at {{serious risk}} of different complications such as periprocedural bleeding {{that can lead}} to myocardial injuries. Blood loss through puncture site hematoma formation and through catheter aspiration causes periprocedural hemoglobin drop. Objectives: Although percutaneous coronary intervention is an effective treatment of coronary artery disease, it seems necessary to investigate the impact of complications on outcomes including myocardial infarction and possible mortality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the relationship between periprocedural hemoglobin levels and <b>cardiac</b> <b>enzyme</b> changes as a predictor of cardiac adverse outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients and Methods: This study was conducted on 1012 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Hemoglobin levels were measured immediately before and post-procedurally and based on the baseline levels the patients were classified into anemic and non-anemic groups. The samples for TnI and CP-MB were collected before the procedure and at 8, 16, and 24 hours post-procedurally.
