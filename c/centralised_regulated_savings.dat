40|$|The {{debate is}} still on {{regarding}} the rationale for transmission expansion in deregulated power markets. Transmission planning with social welfare as the objective {{would lead to a}} different optimal expansion plan compared to the planning deemed optimal by individual merchants acting on market forces with profits as their objective. This issue remains to be resolved amid varying rationales and conflicting interests. Fundamental formulations and analyses for long-term network expansion are presented under the paradigms of (i) system-wide social cost minimisation under central planning, and (ii) profit maximising objectives of merchant entrants covering a range of market structures. Distinct planning outcomes under <b>centralised</b> (<b>regulated</b> monopoly) and decentralised (merchant transmission) network managements, and the relation between these optimal solutions have been quantified analytically. These fundamental formulations would be useful for detailed policy studies, and in the formulation of practical regulatory frameworks in the context of transmission sector market liberalisation.

The French law of 1928, known as “Loi Loucheur”, did not change this mission, rather it strengthened Caisse des Dépôts’ role through a programme of large scale: 200,000 low-cost homes and 80,000 average rent homes.

40|$|Abstract: Australia and New Zealand have {{recently}} experienced the most sweeping changes to their industrial relations systems {{since the first}} decade of the century. Each country has moved from a highly <b>regulated,</b> <b>centralised</b> system towards one in which emphasis is placed on deregulation, decentralisation, and lowering minimum standards and protections. These changes are designed to produce, by the freeing up of the market, labour forces which are more flexible and internationally competitive in an increasingly globalised economy. This paper examines relevant changes in the industrial relations structures and processes in New Zealand, Victoria and the Australian federal system, and explores their consequences. The ideological dimension of the changes is discussed, and it is concluded that while neo-liberal, New Right theories have been influential in motivating the changes, significant elements of continuity with the past have so far been retained...|$|R
40|$|For {{the greater}} part of 2010, {{short-term}} and long-term interest rates in Belgium were at exceptionally low levels. Nominal interest rates reached historic lows; in real terms, only the low point of 1974 remained unequalled. The yield curve was in turn relatively steep. In the first place, the question of whether these low interest rates {{have an impact on the}} overall financial transactions of households is examined. During the recent period, interest rates in real terms have only had a limited influence on the overall volume of savings of Belgian households. It seems that the increased savings behaviour of households and the associated accumulation of net financial assets during the period 2009 - 2010 can largely be attributed to economic uncertainty due to the financial crisis. But it can certainly be assumed that interest rates play some part in the selection of savings and investment vehicles by households. This is the case when they have to choose between short-term and long-term vehicles : long-term investments benefit from a clear preference in periods of high long-term interest rates or when the interest rate cycle has moved into a downward phase. During the few periods with a flat or inverted yield curve, private individuals reduce their short-term deposits since they then possibly expect a fall in long-term yields. It is primarily in the choices between short-term savings vehicles that interest rates have the greatest influence, as witnessed by the persistent switching between term and <b>regulated</b> <b>savings</b> deposits, where the recent fall in short-term interest rates worked strongly in favour of the latter vehicle. The build-up of claims on technical reserves of life insurance companies and pension funds is being stimulated by the current level of interest rates, since certain existing contracts offer a guaranteed return that is higher than the current market rates. Lastly, interest rates have some influence on the commitments entered into by households, and in the first place mortgage loans. It is primarily the number of mortgages that strongly grows in the case of low interest rates. Alongside this, low interest rates may prompt price rises on the housing market with a resulting higher level of recourse to mortgage lending. But lending does not entirely follow the trend in housing prices, partly due to a more restrictive lending policy on the part of the banks. saving, interest rates, credit, portfolio choice...|$|R

This study begins with reviewing comprehensive leadership theories and the GLOBE project findings on New Zealand and China, and discussing the main challenges faced by Chinese managerial leaders at Starbucks in New Zealand based on qualitative interviews.

40|$|Energy is a {{specific}} product, which is produced and sold generally in one region. Therefore clients on the energy market have usually only one energy distributor: the suppliers have the exclusive right to provide energy in the chosen area. The market was <b>centralised</b> and <b>regulated</b> by the government, which set the energy price. Looking {{for the possibility of}} choosing an energy producer providing lower prices, the clients have been urging changes in the energy trade. The government is also trying to deregulate the energy market and make it more competitive by creating the power exchanges, on which trading is much easier and effective in many countries. In Poland on 7 December 1999, there was established the Polish Power Exchange. Its aim is to increase the efficiency of the Polish energy-sector, adjust it to competitive conditions and the requirements of the European Union and to minimise the costs of leading the business. However energy trading in Poland has met many problems, i. e. (a) the existence of long-term contracts, which prevent the liberalisation of the market and continue strengthening the monopoly position of the Polish Power Grid Company (PSE SA) (Transmitting-System Operator), (b) the lack of co-ordinated actions to provide the third-party access to the grid (third-party access principle), which means opening the electric-energy market to final consumers (thereby each recipient can choose the energy producer, who offers the best price and terms of delivery), (c) ineffective Balancing Market (which is a 24 h market). All these difficulties cause that the turn-over on the Polish Power Exchange to be relatively low compared with other countries. Solutions will be proposed in this paper which can promote the liberalisation of the energy trade both from conventional and renewable sources.

40|$|This thesis {{critically}} {{examines the}} historical construction of initial teacher {{education at the}} turn of the 20 th century. It focuses particularly on the extent of state involvement in the process of learning to teach, arguing that this process fulfils the necessary conditions of a rite of passage. The investigation utilises a different theoretical and methodological approach which combines the post-structuralist analyses of Michel Foucault with the cultural-anthropological work of Arnold van Gennep. Together, they provide a framework which enables an archaeological examination of teacher training at the macro-level of the state and its institutions, whilst providing a complementary, genealogical analysis of student teachers at the micro-level of their everyday lives. The investigation found that, in order to transform colonial society into an enlightened rural democracy, the state needed to transform its teachers. It did this through ensuring neophyte teachers passed through a carefully orchestrated rite of passage within a highly <b>centralised</b> and <b>regulated</b> system of training colleges. This necessitated a shift away from the devolved, differentiated pupil-teacher training system. The study traces this move, examines the state?s rationale, and explores the implications for all three phases of the trainees? rite of passage: separation, transition and incorporation. It also explains how specific „ceremonial rituals? and „sacred knowledge? prescribed what new teachers should know and do in order to become productive, docile and economically useful members of society. The study also emphasises that student teachers became subjects-in-their-own-making within this regime of order. The study then shifts its focus to the present, „re-meeting? history by comparing the ritual practices and specialist knowledge of past rites of passage with those of the present. It challenges teacher educators and teachers to take control of teacher education and suggests ways in which they should take advantage of its location in the university by opening up new political spaces and reasserting the importance of professionalism in action...|$|R

Any consideration of the long-term sustainability of external finance for developing countries must be evaluated within these simple but often ignored perspectives. The twenty-year old debt crisis is also a story about common sense facts, which at times have been either ignored or even isolated. Lessons have been learned, but with great difficulty. Nevertheless, the recent 1996 Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the subsequent debates have brought to the fore some of this forgotten evidence. This should be used in efforts to outline a framework for finance for development which might be sustainable by debtor countries, thus preventing future crises. 2 ̆ 013 debt; sustainability; trad...|$|R
40|$|Full Title: The employers' voice: the Australian Chamber/Employer Movement's {{influence}} on government {{policy in the}} post federation period since 1901 This thesis tests {{the proposition that the}} Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) and its antecedents that comprised the Australian Chamber/Employer Movement were influential in {{the rise and fall of}} the “Australian Settlement” during the period 1901 - 2007. In particular the study focuses on the principal economic framework of the Australian Settlement – a policy known as “New Protection”. This policy linked high levels of tariff protection with a heavily <b>regulated</b> <b>centralised</b> wage fixing system operated through Federal compulsory arbitration of industrial relations processes. While previous academic studies have explored aspects of this topic with respect to the Associated Chamber of Manufactures of Australia (ACMA) and the Australian Council of Employers‟ Federations (ACEF) this is the first analysis that incorporates detailed research on the Australian Chamber of Commerce (ACC), which was established in 1901. ACCI is the successor organisation following the progressive amalgamations of the ACC; ACMA; and ACEF. The thesis finds that while public choice theory provides a satisfactory explanation for the motivations of the pressure group behaviour of the Movement on the two principal economic policy areas comprising the Australian Settlement, policy network theory explains the structure of the networks that the Movement used to influence policy, and the Advocacy Coalition Framework‟s (ACF) focus on “learning‟ and the role of new ideas and their dissemination through stakeholder groups provides valuable explanatory power on how the Movement‟s policy positions changed over time. The theoretical value of ACF was also useful in explaining the interaction of interest groups and government decision-makers. This study finds however, that a critical aspect of the Movement‟s communications with decision-makers was the close political links maintained with the centre-right side of politics. Because the value of personal inter-relationships to the lobbying process is paid scant attention in policy network literature, this thesis puts forward the proposition that ACF and policy network theory, more generally, would benefit from a more robust examination and explanation of this type of interaction and the importance of contact at the individual level...|$|R
