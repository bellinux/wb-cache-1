5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout representing the zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial.

A moon dial <b>circles</b> <b>the</b> inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one <b>circles</b> <b>the</b> zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the eggs}} {{is a mixture of}} deuterostome and protostome characteristics.

5|$|In stamp {{collecting}} <b>circles,</b> <b>the</b> word forerunner usually describes {{a postage stamp}} used during the time period before a region or territory issues stamps of its own.

5|$|The {{portrayal}} of nudes was officially discouraged in 17th-century Spain.

5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} from the plane to the sphere and other quadratic surfaces. For the sphere, the problem is to construct all the <b>circles</b> (<b>the</b> boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere. This spherical {{problem can be}} rendered into a corresponding planar problem using stereographic projection. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E

5|$|If {{the three}} given circles are {{mutually}} tangent, Apollonius' problem has five solutions. Three solutions are the given circles themselves, since each is tangent to itself {{and to the}} other two given <b>circles.</b> <b>The</b> remaining two solutions (shown in red in Figure12) correspond to the inscribed and circumscribed circles, and are called Soddy's circles. This special case of Apollonius' problem is also known as the four coins problem. The three given circles of this Apollonius problem form a Steiner chain tangent to the two Soddy's circles.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, Anning {{discovered}} a second, much more complete plesiosaur skeleton, specimen BMNH 22656.

Conybeare's presentation was made at the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur Megalosaurus and the combination created a sensation in scientific <b>circles.</b> <b>The</b> second fossil was named and described as Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus and is the type specimen (holotype) of this species, which itself is the type species of the genus.|$|E

5|$|In the {{classical}} {{presentation of a}} three-set Venn diagram as three overlapping <b>circles,</b> <b>the</b> central region (representing elements belonging to all three sets) takes {{the shape of a}} Reuleaux triangle. The same three circles form one of the standard drawings of the Borromean rings, three mutually linked rings that cannot, however, be realized as geometric circles. Parts of these same circles are used to form the triquetra, a figure of three overlapping semicircles (each two of which form a vesica piscis symbol) that again has a Reuleaux triangle at its center; just as the three circles of the Venn diagram may be interlaced to form the Borromean rings, the three circular arcs of the triquetra may be interlaced to form a trefoil knot.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{constructed}} as a divided four-lane road with two traffic <b>circles,</b> <b>the</b> route of Highway420 formed {{part of the}} QEW between 1941 and 1972 before being assigned a unique route number.

In 1998, the section of Highway420 east of Stanley Avenue was transferred to the responsibility of the Regional Municipality of Niagara and redesignated as Regional Road420.|$|E
5|$|Points {{and lines}} {{may be viewed}} as special cases of circles; a point can be {{considered}} as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given <b>circles.</b> <b>The</b> nine other cases involving points and lines {{may be viewed as}} limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.|$|E
50|$|A compact Riemannian {{surface is}} said to fill a Riemannian <b>circle</b> if <b>the</b> {{boundary}} of the surface is <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> and <b>the</b> filling is said isometric if for any pair of points on <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> <b>the</b> intrinsic distance between them along the surface is the same, and not less, than the intrinsic distance along <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b> In other words, an isometric filling is a filling that does not introduce shortcuts between the points of <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|R
