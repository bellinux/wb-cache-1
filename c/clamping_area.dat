40|$|Delamination {{is one of}} the {{undesired}} {{effects of}} machining using non appropriate cutting parameters or worn drill. Finite element modeling of drilling of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composites is an interesting tool for damage prediction. Recently, complete modeling of the process including the rotatory movement of the drill, penetration in the composite plate and element erosion has been developed in the scientific literature. Computational cost of these complex models is a great disadvantage when comparing them with simplified models that consider the drill acting like a punch that pierces the laminate. In this paper both complete and simplified models were developed and compared in terms of delamination prediction. The simplified model, presenting reduced computational cost, slightly overestimates the delamination factor when compared with the complex model. The influence on delamination of thrust force, <b>clamping</b> <b>area</b> at the bottom surface of the laminate and the stacking sequence is studied using the simplified model.

For traditional road and mountain handlebars, these diameters are standard and so there has historically been little confusion except when mixing road and mountain components. However, in recent years there have been cross-over bar types that do not fall into one category or the other, and which can conceivably use either type of shifter, brake lever or grip (an example is the upright style bar). For this reason, certain handlebars are now available in multiple sizes related to the shifter or brake lever clamp diameter.|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} of temperature-assisted {{incremental}} {{sheet metal forming}} (ISF) of lightweight materials was developed at Fraunhofer IWU. The new process enlarges the area of application of ISF. Sheets of Magnesium and high-strength Aluminum can be formed to complex geometries now. The basic idea of the new ISF process {{is a combination of}} conventional single-point incremental forming (SPIF) with an evenly distributed heated air flow under the sheet. As a result of the heated air, the whole sheet (except for the <b>clamping</b> <b>area)</b> receives approximately the same temperature. This guarantees an optimal process window for several lightweight materials. In the cases of Aluminum and Magnesium, the applicability of the new method has been verified at 250 °C. Here, the part quality was significantly better than conventional ISF results. The comparison with Aluminum parts formed at room temperature corroborated this advantage. This paper describes the development of the test rig. Due to the setup of the specifically designed test rig, the process allows an application of dies and two-point incremental forming (TPIF) as well. Afterwards the SPIF tests and their results are shown and discussed in detail.

40|$|Relatively recent {{discovery}} of shape memory alloys (SMA) justifies ongoing research on their properties and {{an attempt to}} explain the physical phenomenon responsible for the characteristic behaviour of SMA. Moreover, there have been reported many successful commercial SMA applications to medical cases, mostly based on superelasticity.

40|$|To {{downsize}} the <b>clamp</b> <b>area</b> {{and increase}} the output power of the harvester, we developed a miniature piezoelectric vibration energy harvester with combining a Z-shaped folded spring and a mechanically-switching SSHI (synchronized switch harvesting on inductor). The overall harvester size is 4 i× 2 i× 3 cm 3. The FEM analysis revealed that the output power increases {{and the value of}} the 1 st and 2 nd resonance frequencies move closer as the angle of the Z-shaped spring decreases, therefore, the smaller angle would be more promising. The experimental results showed that the maximum output power of our harvester for the 1 st (20. 2 Hz) and 2 nd (53. 0 Hz) resonance frequencies at the applied acceleration of 4. 9 m/s 2 are 088 and 0. 98 mW, respectively. The reason for a marked enhancement of the output power for the 2 nd resonance frequency is attributed to the vertical movement of the 2 nd vibrational mode which applies larger mechanical stress to the piezo ceramic and achieves better electrical contact between the tip of the Z-shaped spring and the spring plunger. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

Some terminals are already capable of actively correcting the loosening of the mechanical clamping. In this diploma thesis an active terminal based on shape memory alloy was designed with the knowledge of the previous solutions of terminals and the theoretical background. The compensation capability is due to a cylinder made from shape memory alloy, which is located in a drill hole on the bottom of a screw. In regular operation mode, the active terminal acts like a common screw terminal. If there is an excessive raise in temperature due to the loosening of a condutor in the terminal, the previously compressed shape memory alloy in the martensite phase will phase change into the austenite phase. The shape memory alloy cyclinder tries to expand to restore his pre-compression form. Due to this, there is a raise in the contact force which will stay after the terminal cooled down because of the restoration of the contact. This thesis furthermore covers experiments regarding parameters like the cyclinder height, drill depth, the initial tension and the compensation of a possible air gap...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCardiopulmonary bypass induces a {{systemic}} inflammatory response that {{may contribute to}} clinical morbidity. Gaseous nitric oxide at relatively low concentrations may elicit peripheral anti-inflammatory effects {{in addition to a}} reduction of pulmonary resistances. We examined the effects of 20 ppm of inhaled nitric oxide administered for 8 hours during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods and resultsTwenty-nine consecutive patients undergoing aortic valve replacement combined with aortocoronary bypass were randomly allocated to either 20 ppm of inhaled nitric oxide (n = 14) or no additional inhalatory treatment (n = 15). Blood samples for total creatine kinase, creatine kinase MB fraction, and troponin I measurements were collected at 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours postsurgery. In addition, we collected perioperative blood samples for measurements of circulating nitric oxide by-products and brain natriuretic peptide. Soluble P-selectin was analyzed in blood samples withdrawn from the coronary sinus before and after aortic <b>clamping.</b> The <b>area</b> under the curve of creatine kinase MB fraction (P =. 03), total creatine kinase (P =. 04), and troponin I (P =. 04) levels were significantly decreased in the nitric oxide–treated patients. Moreover, in the same group we observed blunted P-selectin and brain natriuretic peptide release (P =. 01 and P =. 02, respectively). Nitric oxide inhalation consistently enhanced nitric oxide metabolite levels (P =. 01). ConclusionsNitric oxide, when administered as a gas at low concentration, is able to blunt the release of markers of myocardial injury and to antagonize the left ventricular subclinical dysfunction during and immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass.

After a 210 min of hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp (blood glucose 4. 6 +/- 0. 14 mmol/L), gliclazide or placebo (randomised, double-blind, cross-over) was administered; 60 minutes later, a hyperglycaemic clamp (4 hr) at 8 mmol/L was started. Plasma C-peptide levels increased significantly after the administration of gliclazide (increment 0. 17 +/- 0. 15 vs. 0. 04 +/- 0. 07 nmol/L, p = 0. 024) before the clamp. After the start of the hyperglycaemic <b>clamp,</b> the <b>areas</b> under the curve (AUC) for insulin and C-peptide did not differ from 0 - 10 min (first phase) with gliclazide. However, second-phase insulin release (30 - 240 min) was markedly enhanced by gliclazide. AUC plasma insulin (30 to 240 min) was statistically significantly higher after gliclazide (72. 3 +/- 13. 9 vs. - 0. 56 +/- 9. 4 nmol/l x 210 min, p = 0. 022); similarly, AUC plasma C-peptide (30 to 240 min) was also higher: 128 +/- 62 vs. 63 +/- 50 nmol/L x 210 min, p = 0. 002).

Moreover,the enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase(SOD),total NO synthase(NOS),constitutive NOS(cNOS),inducible NOS(iNOS) and myeloperoxidase(MPO) were determined. Histological analysis of the lesions was also carried out. Results Following I/R,hemorrhagic lesions were generated in the mucosa. Prior administration of L-citrulline(300, 600, 900 mg/kg) before ischemia significantly ameliorated the gastric damage induced by I/R in a dose-dependent manner. The index of lymphocyte infiltration,NO content and lipid peroxidation were reduced significantly(P < 0. 05). In addition,the increase of activities of total NOS and iNOS,and the decrease of cNOS activity in the gastric mucosa were also significantly attenuated by L-citrulline.

40|$|The {{increasing}} material {{temperatures of}} gas turbine components have the consequences that ceramic materials are taken {{more and more}} into account as construction materials. Typical components are turbine blades, nozzles, inlet liners, heat exchangers or combustion components. For their design the material data at operating temperatures have to be known. The most important data are strength, tensile creep and fatigue strength, and the gas corrosion behaviour, which are presented here for a sintered silicon carbide and for temperatures up to 1550 deg C. With slightly modified commercial water cooled hydraulic grips for tension-compression loading a maximum specimen temperature of 1550 deg C could be reached. The development of grips with hot elements have reduced the temperature gradient between the <b>clamping</b> and testing <b>areas</b> of the specimen. With this system specimen temperatures up to 1600 deg C can be reached over a measuring length of 25 mm. Due to the reduced thermal gradient also sh orter specimens can be used. The tensile creep experiments with the silicon carbide tested here show, that a maximum operating temperature for long term applications is limited to about 1500 deg C. Significant creep deformation at 20 OMPa occurs above 1500 deg C. The minimum creep rate can be described by a power law, and the activation energy by an exponential law as far as corrosion can be neglected. After cyclic tension-compression loading at 1 Hz over 100 hrs slightly reduced strength values are detected.

But this combination also increased triglycerides, blood pressure, subcutaneous fat and visceral fat, and decreased the LDL-particle size, LPL activity and insulin sensitivity, which are all considered detrimental. Testosterone reduced HDL-cholesterol and the LDL-particle size, and increased triglycerides and HL activity. An android fat distribution was induced (i. e. decreased subcutaneous and increased visceral fat). Blood pressure, total and LDL-cholesterol, LPL activity and insulin sensitivity were mainly unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of cross-sex hormone treatment - in the dosages {{used in this study}} - in healthy, nonobese, young transsexual subjects do not show unequivocally that female sex steroids, given in large amounts to male subjects, have beneficial effects on cardiovascular profile and that high dose testosterone administration to female subjects is detrimental with respect to cardiovascular risk...|$|R
40|$|Pulse {{pressure}} variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV) are dynamic preload variables {{that can be}} measured noninvasively to assess fluid responsiveness (FR) in anesthetized patients with mechanical ventilation. Few {{studies have examined the}} effectiveness of predicting FR according to the definition of FR, and assessment of inconclusive values of PPV and SVV around the cut-off value (the "grey zone") might improve individual FR prediction. We explored the ability of noninvasive volume clamp derived measurements of PPV and SVV to predict FR using the grey zone approach, and we assessed the influence of multiple thresholds on the predictive ability of the numerical definition of FR. Ninety patients undergoing general surgery were included in this prospective observational study and received a 500 mL fluid bolus as deemed clinically required by the attending anesthesiologist. A minimal relative increase in stroke volume index (a dagger SVI) was used to define FR with different thresholds from 10 - 25 %. The PPV, SVV, and SVI were measured using the NexfinA (R) device that employs noninvasive volume <b>clamp</b> plethysmography. The <b>area</b> under the receiver operator characteristic curve gradually increased for PPV / SVV with higher threshold values (from 0. 818 / 0. 760 at 10 % a dagger SVI to 0. 928 / 0. 944 at 25 % a dagger SVI). The grey zone limits of both PPV and SVV changed from 9 - 16 % (PPV) and 5 - 13 % (SVV) at the 10 % a dagger SVI threshold to 18 - 21 % (PPV) and 14 - 16 % (SVV) at the 25 % a dagger SVI threshold. Noninvasive PPV and SVV measurements allow an acceptable FR prediction, although the reliability of both variables is dependent on the intended increase in SVI, which improves substantially with concomitant smaller grey zones at higher a dagger SVI thresholds...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} obtain induced {{pluripotent}} stem cells starting from adult differentiated cells, discovered in 2006 by Yamanaka, opened new fascinating opportunities {{for the study of the}} development of tissues and organs and for the establishment of new therapeutic approaches. To fully take advantage of {{pluripotent stem cells}} potentiality for scientific and clinical research, it’s necessary to develop also new technologies that will enable the reproduction in vitro of the in vivo environment. In the last decade, it was discovered that the mechanical microenvironment has a very marked impact on virtually all cellular processes, ranging fro morphology to gene expression and faith specification. Mechanotransduction, which is the biological process that enable cells to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli, is present in all cells, however it is believed that it may have greater influence in tissues that are subjected to higher mechanical stimuli in vivo, as in the case of the cardiovascular system. As an example, it has been shown that mechanical cues strongly affect the development and maturation of cardiovascular tissues, and that abnormal mechanotransduction can be linked to the onset of several cardiovascular diseases. There is a great interest in the scientific and clinical research communities on the study of the cardiovascular system since cardiovascular diseases are the principal cause of death worldwide and also the associated health care costs to prevent and treat these pathologies are quite elevated. Moreover, cardiovascular toxicity is the primary cause of drug withdrawal, so the development of novel, more accurate models of the cardiovascular system are extremely important also for pharmaceutical research and development. The aim of this work is to develop innovative technologies to reproduce in vitro the in vivo mechanical microenvironment, specifically that of the cardiovascular system, to gather further knowledge on the biological response to mechanical cues. In particular, these newly developed technologies could be used to reproduce the mechanical stimuli exerted on the cardiovascular system by physical strain, such as agonistic motorcycle driving. Specifically, in this thesis the focus was on reproducing the characteristic morphology of cardiovascular tissues’ cells and on mimicking mechanical strains typical of the cardiovascular system. Firstly, the polarization typical of cardiac muscle cells has been reproduced on glass, outilining and optimizing strategies to obtain aligned cardiomyocytes. The alignment is imposed creating a linear pattern of cell repulsive stripes, made of polyacrylamide hydrogels, alternated with protein-coated cell adhesive stripes. The establishment of a robust and precise glass patterning technique during this work will allow to study in depth the effect of topology and polarization on cellular gene expression and also will enable the study of cardiomyocytes intercalated discs’ morphology and the transmission of electrical signals among neighboring cells. Later on, the patterning techniques were transferred to elastomeric materials, such as PDMS, to perform mechanical stimulation of aligned cardiomyocytes cultures, reenacting the organ and tissues environment. The first stretching device realized was designed to perform biological assays that require an elevated quantity of starting material, such as protein, DNA or RNA extractions. For this reason the culturing area is 9 cm 2, and mechanical deformation is imposed through the mechanical traction generated by the ElectroForce® planar biaxial TestBench (Bose). In this device, cell alignment is obtained through physical pattering, which means the creation of PDMS channels of different heights along which the cells are seeded. The second stretching device realized during this work was designed mainly for imaging analysis, such as immunofluorescence, and patch <b>clamp.</b> The culturing <b>area</b> is 1 cm 2, and mechanical deformation is generated inflating a PDMS membrane in specifically designed rectangular areas that constitute about 40...|$|R
