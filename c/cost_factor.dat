An additional <b>cost</b> <b>factor</b> is that a high water table would require more concrete. There is also a $300 million maintenance cost to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE's opening {{resulting in a total}} project cost of $3.2 billion.|$|E

Generally speaking, cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service, especially if direct cremation is chosen, in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services. However, for some even cremation is still relatively expensive, especially {{as a lot of}} fuel is required to perform it. Methods to reduce fuel consumption/fuel cost include the use of different fuels (i.e. natural gas or propane, compared to wood) and by using an incinerator (retort) (closed cabin) rather than an open fire.|$|E

Analysis of <b>cost</b> <b>factors</b> requires an appreciation of a country’s practices. Identified <b>cost</b> <b>factors</b> provide an indication of a country’s construction economic strata. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify the essential factors that affect unit cost estimation and their breakdown using artificial neural networks. Twenty five (25) identified <b>cost</b> <b>factors</b> in road construction were subjected to a questionnaire survey and employing SPSS factor analysis the factors were reduced to eight. The 8 factors were analysed using neural network (NN) to determine the proportionate breakdown of the <b>cost</b> <b>factors</b> in a given construction unit rate. NN predicted that political environment accounted 44 % of the unit rate followed by contractor capacity at 22 % and financial delays, project feasibility and overhead & profit each at 11 %. Project location, material availability and corruption perception index had minimal impact on the unit cost from the training data provided. Quantified <b>cost</b> <b>factors</b> can be incorporated in unit cost estimation models (UCEM) to produce more accurate estimates. This can create improvements in the cost estimation of infrastructure projects and establish a benchmark standard to assist the process of alignment of work practises and training of new staff, permitting the on-going development of best practises in cost estimation to become more effective.

Priority ranking of these factors shows that only 35 <b>cost</b> <b>factors</b> are regarded by the respondents working for the small, medium and large construction companies in the Klang Valley, Malaysia as highly relevant for building construction projects. ‘Client requirements on quality’ is found to be the most critical factor that influences the costs of building construction projects...|$|R
25|$|New {{chemical}} glass compositions or {{new treatment}} techniques can be initially investigated in small-scale laboratory experiments. The {{raw materials for}} laboratory-scale glass melts are often different from those used in mass production because the <b>cost</b> <b>factor</b> has a low priority. In the laboratory mostly pure chemicals are used. Care must be taken that the raw materials have not reacted with moisture or other chemicals in the environment (such as alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides and hydroxides, or boron oxide), or that the impurities are quantified (loss on ignition). Evaporation losses during glass melting should be considered during {{the selection of the}} raw materials, e.g., sodium selenite may be preferred over easily evaporating SeO2. Also, more readily reacting raw materials may be preferred over relatively inert ones, such as Al(OH)3 over Al2O3. Usually, the melts are carried out in platinum crucibles to reduce contamination from the crucible material. Glass homogeneity is achieved by homogenizing the raw materials mixture (glass batch), by stirring the melt, and by crushing and re-melting the first melt. The obtained glass is usually annealed to prevent breakage during processing.|$|E

40|$|Enterprise {{resource}} planning (ERP) systems adoptions require substantial {{resources and}} investments. The majority of businesses {{around the globe}} can {{be considered to be}} small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Thus, SMEs are seen to be typical companies that are the cornerstone of most economies. Compared with large enterprises, an SME-context contains several characteristics, and scarcity of resources is among the top of them. For SMEs, unplanned costs escalation could pose a serious threat to their stability and survival in the market. Frequently, ERP projects have crossed their estimated budgets and schedules. Researchers and practitioners state that a prevailing number of ERP adoption projects fail due to inaccurate or to too optimistic budgets/schedules. In addition, many organizations face difficulties in identifying the potential <b>cost</b> <b>factors</b> that could occur during their ERP adoption lifecycle. While focusing on the SME-context, this research attempts to identify potential costs that could occur in ERP adoptions. The research method employed in this study targeted diverse stakeholders and experts involved in ERP projects in Egypt. This research provides a list of <b>cost</b> <b>factors</b> and their classifications that could aid adopting organizations to better estimate their needed ERP project budgets. In particular, this research explores the direct and indirect <b>cost</b> <b>factors</b> that occur in ERP adoptions in Egyptian SMEs. Also, this study investigates the influence of some SME-specific contextual <b>factors</b> on <b>costs.</b> Moreover, the paper provides a ranking of <b>cost</b> <b>factors</b> according to their impact on total adoption costs...|$|R
