The study was conducted by collecting thirteen market baskets from supermarkets and market places in the city of Kuopio, eastern Finland. Altogether 115 different food samples were bought. In each basket foodstuffs were mixed in proportion to their consumption and analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry for seven organic tin compounds (mono-, di-, and tributyltin, mono-, di-, and triphenyltin, and dioctyltin). Organotin compounds were detected in only four baskets, with the fish basket containing the largest number of different organotins. The European Food Safety Authority has established a tolerable daily intake of 250 ng/kg body weight for the sum of dibutyltin, tributyltin, triphenyltin, and dioctyltin. According to this study, the daily intake of these compounds was 2. 47 ng/kg body weight, of which 81 % originated from the market basket for fish.

Microwave extraction is more efficient than other conventional extraction methods in many ways. Microwaves allow for rapid and selective extraction of organic compounds with low solvent and energy consumptions [87, 88]. In conventional extraction the extractability of different components depends mainly on the solubility of the compound in the solvent, mass transfer kinetics of the product and matrix interactions [89], whereas under microwave-assisted extraction localized superheating rate {{plays an important role}} in extraction efficiency.

In this context the project FOODMIGROSURE (QLRT- 2001 - 2390) aims to find tools which allows to estimate consumer exposure to these chemicals. In order to carry out a compilation of the available information on analytical methods to determine model migrants in selected foodstuffs, an extensive bibliographic review was done.

Otherwise, related health effects like acute and chronic intoxications, and even deaths, will still be an issue. Therefore, in this research the microbial and total aflatoxins analysis of selected cereal flours processed and sold in Abakaliki metropolis was carried out. A total of four cereal samples (maize, millet, sorghum and wheat) were studied. The total aflatoxins were analyzed using highly sensitive competitive Enzyme Link Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader. The cereal samples were also analyzed for total fungal count using digital colony counting machine (CCM China). The result showed that all the cereal flours (wheat, sorghum, millet and maize) analyzed were heavily contaminated with fungal cells. The flours also contain unacceptable levels of aflatoxins. The total aflatoxins were above the minimum acceptable limits (10 ppm) according to National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).

40|$|Polyamines (PAs) are {{ubiquitous}} substances {{considered as}} bioregulators of numerous cell functions, {{being involved in}} cell growth, division and differentiation. These biogenic amines are also involved in tissue repairing and in intracellular signaling; in fact, because of their polycationic character, they interact strongly with membrane phospholipids and may {{play an important role}} in the regulation of membrane-linked enzymes. The intracellular polyamines content derives from the simultaneous regulation of their synthesis, catabolism, uptake and elimination; furthermore, PAs are present in all cell types at variable concentrations, but the highest levels are found in rapid-turnover tissues. In addition to spermidine, spermine and putrescine, also agmatine (AGM), deriving from arginine and identified in mammals in the 1990 s, belongs to PAs and several studies have reported its possible positive role in secretagogues, neuronal, vascular, metabolic and therapeutic functions. Because of the low arginine decarboxylase activity (ADC) in mammalians, the amounts of AGM found in their tissues can be only minimally ascribed to an endogenous de novo synthesis by the ADC, while a substantial AGM portion can be of dietary origin. Several food products contain only small amounts of polyamines, while higher concentrations can be found in fermented foods. PAs could also be considered as indicators of freshness in fish and meat products, being these moieties produced during food storage, thus confirming the main role of microorganisms in their synthesis.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 94 - 150) Concomitant {{with the}} current rapid expansion of both nuclear and nonnuclear industries that utilize uraniferous materials, there is an increasing potential for chronic and uncontrolled low-level increases of highly chemotoxic uranyl compounds into the hydrosphere. These releases may represent an insidious and growing environmental health hazard which has received minimal attention and research emphasis. Knowledge of the radioecological concentration mechanisms that ultimately determine human exposures to uranium <b>compounds</b> via <b>foodstuffs</b> is very limited. More detailed information on these mechanisms is urgently needed to evaluate the element's hazard potential {{and to provide a}} basis for development of water quality control criteria. Following a review of uranium pollution source characteristics, the results of experimental investigations of uranium uptake by an important marine pollution indicator organism, the California sea mussel (Mytilus californianus Conrad), are presented. Using a delayed fission neutron analysis technique, total uranium concentrations in soft tissues of mussels collected from two Pacific Coast sites were determined and concentration factors relative to seawater were calculated. Similar analyses were performed on laboratory specimens held in marine aquaria containing elevated concentrations of uranium and combinations of sewage to determine uptake parameters in various simulated pollution situations. Results of these studies indicate that M. californianus is a poor accumulator of uranium, even at exposures 100 times higher than the normal seawater concentration of 3. 34 parts per billion. The presence of sewage in uranium-contaminated seawater was found to initially accelerate uptake of the element: however, no long-term increases in tissue concentrations compared with those from specimens exposed to similar levels of uranium in the absence of sewage were observed. In all experiments, concentration factors relative to seawater were extremely low, ranging from 1. 7 to 18. 3. Based upon these results, and standards for maximum allowable uranium concentration levels in foods, it appears that human consumption of shellfish from waters with elevated uranium concentrations is unlikely to present a significant chemical intoxication hazard. Further research is proposed and an extensive bibliography of literature published since 1945 is included for future research...|$|R

An in-house method validation, based on the SANCO guidelines (Document SANCO No. 12571 / 2013), was conducted using three independent series in orange, lettuce, and avocado composite samples spiked at three levels (10, 100, 500 μg/kg). Trueness and precision were calculated by pooling all results at each concentration level to account for the variability among fruits and vegetables. To avoidmatrix effects on quantitative results, five quantification strategies were investigated: (i) solvent calibration, (ii) matrix-matched calibration prepared on samples and (iii) on sample extract aliquots, and (iv) standard addition prepared on samples and (v) on sample extract aliquots. Due to the nonlinear instrumental response for the large concentration range investigated, a quadratic calibration model was mandatory for all approaches. Solvent calibration gave very poor recoveries due to the high signal suppression caused by matrix effects. Smaller biases were observed for matrix-matched calibrations; however, these results exhibited relatively low precision. Both of the standard addition methods compensated for matrix effects and provided accurate analytical results. Due to the ease of its implementation, the matrix standard addition method, where analytes are added to sample extract aliquots, was preferred over the classical standard addition in samples. Nonlinear extrapolations appeared to be particularly effective in obtaining good results for both standard addition methods when the calibration curve was convex or very slightly concave.

PS {{are known to have}} several bioactive properties with various implications on human health, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-carcinogenic activities and cholesterol lowering capacity. Analytical methods are critical elements for the correct and accurate determination of PS. A review of the last three decades, based on compilation of the available information on the different steps (extraction, saponification, derivatization and chromatographic method) of PS determination was performed. The preparation samples for PS analyses should take into account the nature of matrix, its physical sate, among others. Most of the times, ethanolic or methanolic potassium hydroxide are the selected reagents for the saponification, which can be performed at room temperature or with heating. For derivatization, N,O-Bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) with 1 % of trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) or N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) are the most used reagents. Capillary gas-chromatography (GC), with flame ionization detector (FID) or mass spectrometry (MS), proved to be simple and accurate to perform analytical determinations on this group of compounds. However, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with different detection systems has also been used. Analysis of PS are best carried out using 30 m x 0. 25 mm i. d. x 0. 25 µm film thickness, flexible, fused capillary columns coated with 5 % phenyl and 95 % methyl siloxane, because it has a high thermal stability and provides better resolution of peaks.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2016. Major: Food Science. Advisor: Devin Peterson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 139 pages. Despite the increasing demand, healthier foods suffer from lower consumer acceptability due to inferior flavor quality. The flavor of food is greatly {{affected by the}} food composition and thermal processing. This study specifically investigates the thermal processing impact on {{the positive and negative}} taste attributes of foodstuffs, which enables the optimization of processing strategies to improve the palatability and ultimately the consumption of ‘healthier’ formulated food products. The overall goal of this work was to characterize the effect of thermal processing on the taste-active compounds or the generation of taste modulating <b>compounds</b> in <b>foodstuffs.</b> This work mainly focuses on the influence of three common thermal processing techniques on the resulting taste profiles in three food systems respectively: the roasting of cocoa, the extrusion of corn cereal, and the frying of potato chips. These three processing techniques are widely utilized by the food industry. Bitterness was investigated in roasted cocoa and extruded whole grain corn while umami was characterized in deep fried potato chips. The influence of roasting on the taste attributes of cocoa was studied first. Roasting processes involve the Maillard reaction, which is a ubiquitous thermally catalyzed chemical pathway that is well-known to impact aroma development as well as taste, such as bitterness. Bitterness is a challenge for consumer acceptability, which is typically masked by adding sugar. The goal of this part of the research was to discover the impact of Maillard chemistry on endogenous bitter-tasting compound, catechin, in raw cocoa, and likewise on the resulting bitter taste profile of the roasted beans. Catechin-Maillard reaction products were identified by stable isotope labeling techniques in model reactions using the simulated cocoa roasting conditions. Eight reaction products were identified and reported for the first time. One of the newly-identified compounds significantly suppressed the perceived bitter intensity of the caffeine solution, which is a novel bitter blocker. Further analysis revealed that this bitter blocking compound was present in both the raw and roasted cocoa beans; however its concentration was higher in roasted cocoa beans. A generation mechanism of the bitter blocker was proposed. The results of the first phase indicated that the bitter profile of cocoa beans was altered by thermal reactions of the endogenous bitter compounds. In the second research phase of this study, the influence of extrusion on the taste profile of puffed whole grain corn products was examined. The goal of this phase is to identify the key bitter compounds and understand how they are influenced by extrusion. Three phenolic compounds (chaenorpine, coumaryl-spermidine, terrestribisamide) and one amino acid (L-tryptophan) were identified as the main bitter compounds in the extruded whole grain corn product. Based on sensory recombination analysis, chaenorpine was found to have the highest contribution to the bitterness intensity, based on the concentration of the bitter compounds reported in the saliva during mastication. Additionally, all of the identified bitter compounds were found to be degraded during extrusion, suggesting that the further optimization of extrusion could be utilized to suppress bitterness in order to improve the flavor quality of whole grain extruded products. In the last phase of this research project, the role of the thermal process, deep frying, on the taste profile of potato chips was examined. Potato chips are a highly desired food product and the umami taste is well known to positively contribute to the taste profile. Initial analysis indicated that the umami taste attribute of potato chips increases with frying time thus the compounds that contribute to umami were characterized. A dehydration product of monosodium glutamate (MSG), monosodium L-pyroglutamate (L-MSpG) and monosodium D-pyroglutamate (D-MSpG) were identified {{for the first time as}} umami enhancing compounds that contributed to the umami flavor of potato chips. The generation of pyroglutamates was reported to be directly related to the frying time. Sensory time-intensity taste analysis of potato chips with topical added L-MSpG and D-MSpG revealed significantly higher umami intensity and the overall higher potato chip flavor intensity. In summary, the impact of three thermal processes on taste profile was studied in three different food products. This study provides a novel basis for flavor optimization by investigating the thermal impact on taste chemistry. The ultimate goal of this study is to increase the market demand for health conscious foods, thus benefiting the food industry as well as promoting a healthy lifestyle...|$|R
