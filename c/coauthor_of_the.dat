40|$|It is {{surprising}} that the prevailing performance taxonomy for scientists (Star versus Non-Star) focuses only on individual output and ignores social behavior since, innovation is often charac-terized as a communal process. To address this deficiency I expand the traditional taxonomy that focuses solely on productivity and add a second, social dimension to <b>the</b> taxonomy <b>of</b> scien-tists: helpfulness to others. Using a combination of academic paper publications and citations to capture scientist productivity and <b>the</b> receipt <b>of</b> academic paper acknowledgements to mea-sure helpfulness, I classify a group of 149 immunologists into four distinct categories of human capital quality: All-Stars who have both high productivity and helpfulness; Lone Wolves who have high productivity but average helpfulness; Mavens who have average productivity but high helpfulness; and Non-Stars who have both average productivity and helpfulness. Looking at the change in quality-adjusted publishing output <b>of</b> an immunologist’s <b>coauthors</b> after the im-munologist’s death, I find that <b>the</b> productivity <b>of</b> <b>coauthors</b> <b>of</b> All-Stars decreases by 16 %, and <b>coauthors</b> <b>of</b> Mavens decreases by 14 %, all relative to the decrease in productivity <b>of</b> <b>coauthors</b> <b>of</b> Non-Stars. <b>The</b> productivity <b>of</b> <b>coauthors</b> <b>of</b> Lone Wolves, however, is not statistically dif-ferent from the decrease in productivity <b>of</b> <b>coauthors</b> <b>of</b> Non-Stars.

40|$|Unplanned coauthorship {{refers to}} {{the process by which}} {{contributors}} to a creative work are treated by copyright law as <b>coauthors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work based entirely on their observable behavior during its creation. The process entails a court imputing <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> <b>coauthors</b> to <b>the</b> parties ex post, usually during a claim for copyright infringement. For years now, courts and scholars have struggled to identify a coherent rationale for unplanned coauthorship and situate it within copyright’s set of goals and objectives. This Article offers a novel framework for understanding <b>the</b> rules <b>of</b> unplanned coauthorship using insights from theories of shared intentionality. Unplanned coauthorship enables courts to balance copyright’s commitment to authorial autonomy and individual ownership against <b>the</b> demands <b>of</b> cooperation, collaboration, and information sharing that the creative process invariably entails. Through these rules, copyright law recognizes that certain forms of creativity depend entirely on mechanisms of collaboration for their continuing existence. In such instances <b>of</b> collaborative creativity, <b>the</b> very process <b>of</b> collaboration provides creators with additional and independent reasons for their creative endeavor, a motivation referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 collaborative impulse. 2 ̆ 2 Characteristic of all joint activities undertaken with a shared intention, the collaborative impulse derives from a motivational commitment to the joint task that collaborating creators develop, causing them to pay equal attention to both the means and <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> their creativity. <b>The</b> Article shows how <b>the</b> rules <b>of</b> unplanned coauthorship allow copyright law to nurture these domains of collaborative creativity by protecting the collaborative impulse and simultaneously rendering it fully compatible with copyright’s utilitarian goal of promoting creativity through exclusive rights...|$|R
40|$|Mikhail Bakhtin {{proposed}} that a ‘hero {{is not only}} a discourse about himself and his immediate environment, but also a discourse about the world’. This short article examines <b>the</b> working practice <b>of</b> an applied theatre practitioner, drawing on Bakhtin’s interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hero and his writings on dialogism. Artist Kate Sweeney’s facilitation of a storytelling workshop with older people is explored in order to place the practitioner as the central protagonist in a narrative of participatory theatre processes. My research, using a process of reflective dialogues, has found that experienced practitioners are themselves open to a process <b>of</b> change through <b>the</b> work, which I have articulated as a mode <b>of</b> ‘responsivity’. <b>The</b> research method <b>of</b> reflective dialogues connects observation of working processes with a subsequent conversation with the practitioner about moments <b>of</b> practice, and <b>the</b> meanings that emerge are therefore infused with practitioners’ discourses on the work.
