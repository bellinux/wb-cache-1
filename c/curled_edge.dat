5000|$|The naming ("honing" [...] or [...] "sharpening") {{is often}} a misnomer, because the {{traditional}} [...] "honing steel" [...] neither hones nor sharpens a blade. Instead, its function is to realign a <b>curled</b> <b>edge</b> rather than remove metal from the edge. The term [...] "hone" [...] is associated with light maintenance performed on a blade without the effort and precision normally associated with sharpening, so the name [...] "hone" [...] was loaned. In the 1980s, ceramic abrasives became increasingly popular, and proved an equal, if not superior, method for accomplishing the same daily maintenance tasks; manufacturers replaced steels with ceramic (and later, manufactured diamond abrasive) sharpening [...] "steels" [...] that were, in fact, hones.|$|E

Methods: Totally 291 traumatic eardrum perforations with in-/everted edges were included in this study.

Patients in each group were further divided into two subgroups according to the eardrum flap area≤ 1 / 2 or > 1 / 2 of the perforation size.

40|$|Abstract—Iron and silicon {{in various}} {{proportions}} {{are the major}} components of the newly formed hydro-thermal sediments in the Atlantis II Deep, Red Sea. Iron-rich 2 : 1 phyllosilicates with morphologies varying from ribbons to plates represent clays in initial formation stage. Well-crystallized goethite particles contain domains of hundreds of nanometers in length with the rare presence of dislocations. Molar compositions show ratios of Si/Fe 5 0. 12 and Al/Fe 5 0. 05. Euhedral feroxyhyte with <b>curled</b> <b>edges</b> forms clusters with the goethite. The feroxyhyte has ratios of Si/Fe 5 0. 3 and are the major Si-associated iron oxides. Two nanometer-size phases showing short range periodity are common in the newly formed Atlantis II sediments: (1) hematite with traces of Si and (2) ferrihydrite with Si/Fe molar ratios varying between 0. 17 – 0. 89. The ferrihydrite forms large clusters. Hematite appears also as well-crystallized large crystals. Feroxyhyte probably forms at the transition zone between Red Sea Deep Water and the upper convective layer in the brine, whereas goethite and ferrihydrite form in the upper convective layer. The two forms of hematite represent two stages of recrystallization, which occur within the brine...|$|R

50|$|Tanacetum camphoratum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the aster family known by the common names camphor tansy and dune tansy. It is native to the Pacific Coast of North America from British Columbia to California, where it grows in sand dunes and other coastline habitat. This species may be known by the synonym Tanacetum douglasii and is often included in Tanacetum bipinnatum. It is a rhizomatous perennial herb with a thick, low-lying stem up to 25 centimeters long, branching to form a mass of vegetation. It is hairy, glandular, and aromatic, with a camphor scent. The leaves are up to 25 centimeters long and thick but featherlike, divided into many narrow leaflets {{on each side of}} the main rachis. Each leaflet in turn has many segments along each side, and the segments are usually divided into several small, knobby segments with folded or <b>curled</b> <b>edges.</b> The inflorescence bears up to 15 flower heads, each about a centimeter wide or slightly wider. Each head contains many yellowish disc florets and many pistillate florets around the edges. The latter may have minute ray florets.

We used the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program, which collects data from a nationally representative stratified probability sample of 66 U. S. hospital EDs. Sample weights were used to make national estimates. RESULTS: Annually, an estimated 37, 991 adults age 65 years or older were treated in U. S. EDs for falls associated with carpets (54. 2 %) and rugs (45. 8 %). Most falls (72. 8 %) occurred at home. Women represented 80. 2 % of fall injuries. The most common location for fall injuries in the home was the bathroom (35. 7 %). Frequent fall injuries occurred at the transition between carpet/rug and non-carpet/rug, on wet carpets or rugs, and while hurrying to the bathroom. CONCLUSIONS: Fall injuries associated with rugs and carpets are common and may cause potentially severe injuries.

40|$|AbstractHuman {{red blood}} cells (RBCs) lack the actin-myosin-microtubule {{cytoskeleton}} {{that is responsible for}} shape changes in other cells. Nevertheless, they can display highly dynamic local deformations in response to external perturbations, such as those that occur during the process of apical alignment preceding merozoite invasion in malaria. Moreover, after lysis in divalent cation-free media, the isolated membranes of ruptured ghosts show spontaneous inside-out curling motions at the free edges of the lytic hole, leading to inside-out vesiculation. The molecular mechanisms that drive these rapid shape changes are unknown. Here, we propose a molecular model in which the spectrin filaments of the RBC cortical cytoskeleton control the sign and dynamics of membrane curvature depending on whether the ends of the filaments are free or anchored to the bilayer. Computer simulations of the model reveal that curling, as experimentally observed, can be obtained either by an overall excess of weakly-bound filaments throughout the cell, or by the flux of such filaments toward the <b>curling</b> <b>edges.</b> Divalent cations have been shown to arrest the curling process, and Ca 2 + ions have also been implicated in local membrane deformations during merozoite invasion. These effects can be replicated in our model by attributing the divalent cation effects to increased filament-membrane binding. This process converts the curl-inducing loose filaments into fully bound filaments that arrest curling. The same basic mechanism can be shown to account for Ca 2 +-induced local and dynamic membrane deformations in intact RBCs. The implications of these results in terms of RBC membrane dynamics under physiological, pathological, and experimental conditions is discussed...|$|R
