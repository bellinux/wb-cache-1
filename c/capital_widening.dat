The shift in the capital was mirrored by a shift in tactics from active defense to passive defense against the Rouran. While the capital was moved to Luoyang, the military elite remained centered at the old <b>capital,</b> <b>widening</b> {{the differences between the}} administration and the military. The population at the old capital remained fiercely conservative, while the population at Luoyang were much more eager to adopt Xiaowen's policies of sinicization. His reforms were met with resistance by the Xianbei elite. In 496, two plots by Xianbei nobles, one centered on his crown prince Yuan Xun, and one centered on his distant uncle Yuan Yi (元頤). By 497, Xiaowen had destroyed the conspiracies and forced Yuan Xun to commit suicide.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{develop a}} {{competitive}} model of innovation along a quality ladder that mimicks {{the features of}} more traditional models based on increasing returns and monopoly power. First we show that, {{in the absence of}} fixed cost, the competitive equilibrium implies alternating phases of <b>capital</b> <b>widening</b> and deepening, during which a discrete amount of resorces is invested, at regular intervals in time, to move up the ladder. Next we introduce technological fixed cost and show that, when these are not too large, the same first-best efficient allocation obtains in competitive equilibrium. Finally we look at the case in which fixed cost are large and competitive equilibrium is no longer firstbest efficient. We introduce two notions of competitive equilibrium, which we deem appropriate for handling these circumstances, and show that such equilibria exist, {{there are quite a few}} of them and they can be pareto ranked. 1 1...|$|E

She soon made friends with Liubov Gurevich, the most important women journalist {{at the time and}} the married couple, Sophia Chatskina (...) and Yakov Saker (...) [...] The couple owned the journal Northern Annals, publishing the works of poets such as Alexander Blok, Mikhail Kuzmin, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Fyodor Sologub, and Maximilian Voloshin. Parnok enrolled in the Bestuzhev Courses to study law and continued publishing poems in various journals. She also began to do translation work, having been invited in 1908 by Gurevich to co-edit a French-Russian translation of Petits poèmes en prose by Charles Baudelaire. The Baudelaire project fell apart, her Graves' disease flared up, and she became increasingly unhappy with her work. In January 1909, finding her marriage to be stifling, Parnok left her husband and settled in Moscow. Volkenstein finally agreed to a divorce in the spring, but their break-up embittered the two and their earlier friendship never recovered.|$|R

40|$|An {{examination}} of Labour Force Survey data from May 1997 to May 2000 {{suggests that the}} long-term decline in labour force participation for older Australian men has recently abated. This shift may be already reflecting {{the emergence of a}} new set labour market conditions linked to the declining rate of growth of the Australian labour force due to population ageing. The data show that the growth in the employment of men in older age groups has exceeded the growth of these groups due to population ageing. Further, older men are satisfying employer demand in a range of occupations, including higher-skilled occupations and, in the majority of cases, on a full-time basis. The paper argues that the challenge of ensuring a vibrant and responsive economy can be met despite labour force ageing if sufficient resources are committed to Australia’s human capital development and if sufficient measures are taken to stem the incidence of early retirement. It is further argued that a decisive shift in strategic outlook by national leaders would be necessary to the success of an intensive human capital approach to maintaining productivity growth. Whereas the 1980 s and 1990 s were dominated by a preoccupation with <b>capital</b> <b>widening</b> and aggregate economic growth, premised on population growth, a human capital based response to labour market ageing would require a strategic refocussing upon per capita economic growth...|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of present}} {{research}} is to investigate {{the response of the}} universities after implementing the higher education commission (HEC) reorganized policies for widening participation and improving the quality in the higher education system of Pakistan. The relationship between education and economic growth has been emphasized in the literature. The Human Capital approach that stresses the quality of the labor and the contribution of enrollments factor is used for widening participation for the economic growth of the country. The other relevant concepts of rate of return with respect to private and social benefits have been presented to smooth the trend of widening access and quality in higher education. Moreover, the experiences of central European and South East Asian countries about the expansion trends are analyzed for finding the valuable lessons. The higher education system of Pakistan with the perspectives of expansion trends and quality improvement amendments is analyzed for recognizing the HEC initiatives and outcomes. The major focus of the study is to investigate the reaction of three public sector universities after the implementation of HEC policies in 2004. The evaluative case study methodology was adopted by the researcher. The data was gathered through analysis of policy documents and interviews conducted in three public sector universities about the following issues: students? enrollments and expenditures per student. The documents like official reports, online papers and newspapers were consulted along with the interviews for getting upgraded information. The undertaken analysis has resulted in several basic findings. It has been concluded that universities are gradually increasing access opportunities by introducing new disciplines particularly, and also establishing many new higher education?s institutions for expanding participation in this decade. The establishment of quality enhancement cells along with hiring foreign faculty and PhDs in public universities are significant steps for both access and quality improvement of higher education in Pakistan.

40|$|Saving {{opportunities}} {{can only}} be offered in group-lending by re-stricting the number of borrowers in a group, thus creating intra-group competition for loans. Our model predicts that this would lead to negative assortative matching along wealth lines (the wealthy would group with poorer individuals).

The non-borrower’s wealth threshold increases and the borrower’s wealth threshold decreases {{with the cost of}} <b>capital,</b> thus <b>widening</b> the gap between the two thresholds.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a simple theory {{to study how}} the allocation of public funds between primary and higher education affects human capital accumulation. The allocation is endogenously determined through majority voting. Public funding for higher education is not supported when a majority is poor. In some cases, higher education starts to be realized as a majority of individuals accumulate enough human capital through primary education. Although the emergence of higher education can accelerate aggregate human <b>capital</b> accumulation, it <b>widens</b> income inequality because the very poor are excluded from higher education and the declined budget share for primary education decreases its quality. ...|$|R

They aim to help organizations raise <b>capital,</b> to <b>widen</b> professional networks and to stimulate regional development. As a contribution toward determining {{the success of the}} forum concept, the Florida venture forum was studied. This paper follows those companies who received funding subsequent to participating in the forum during the period 1997 – 2003; data is drawn from the forum and public records. Funding profiles are built up for successful participants and the funding entities. A secondary profile, post-funding, is developed that examines the role the funding agent plays in determining whether the funded company remains or migrates from its original location. The finding of this paper is that a significant number of funded entities are located within venture capital cores or clusters. The paper shows that funded companies are younger than non-funded companies, more likely to be acquired and move from their original location. The paper also shows that the participant companies that were acquired achieve an exit strategy by migrating out of the state of Florida.

40|$|The Austrian {{system of}} {{severance}} pay {{is the subject}} of two reform proposals currently before Parliament. Their effects on the development of labour costs largely depend on the level of severance pay under the current legislation and the provisions already built up on the balance sheets of firms. In the absence of official records, estimates have to be used for both figures. Based on the distribution of wages over the duration of employment, WIFO estimates current severance payments at 2. 3 percent of wages and salaries, which corresponded to a total of ATS 19. 2 billion in 1997. Provisions for severance payments on the balance sheets of firms are estimated at ATS 75, 2 billion, the stock of assets covering such provisions being ATS 37, 6 billion (1997). These numbers do not include voluntary severance payments beyond the statutory obligation. On the basis of these initial values, the reform proposal introduced by the Social Democratic Party requires a transition period of 15 years to take full effect, whereas the proposal submitted by the People's Party assumes a maximum of 40 years (excluding voluntary change-over to the new system). A fixed contribution rate of 2. 5 percent of wages and salaries, as provided for in the ÖVP proposal, will result in a reduction of long-term labour costs. In the short to medium term, however, transition costs will arise. The SPÖ proposal will increase labour costs due to severance pay drastically in the short term and slightly in the long term. Compared with the current situation, the change-over to a contribution-based system encompassing all employees will not be neutral with respect to different sectors of the economy. Labour costs in seasonal sectors or sectors with a high mobility of labour will increase significantly. The budgetary effects for public households will be positive in the long run, since interest on <b>capital</b> <b>widens</b> the base for taxation, but negative in the short term. Due to deferred taxation, tax revenues under the new system will be lower in the initial years after its introduction. The current system of severance pay imposes a heavy burden on the liquidity management of firms. Payments are made in the form of lump sums at the termination of an employment contract. The change to a contribution-based system will smooth the demand for liquidity and therefore facilitate financial planning. This will be of advantage, above all, for highly leveraged firms and firms in financial trouble. Consequently, the number of insolvencies ought to decline over time. A transition phase with high additional costs due to the co-existence of the old and new systems will be a considerable challenge to liquidity management. Small retail and manufacturing businesses are likely to encounter difficulties under such a scenario.

40|$|This paper uses new micro {{data from}} the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS) to examine changes in wage {{inequality}} from 1986 to 2003. We establish how much inequality increased, and what drives the increase: changes {{in the labor force}} composition or changes in the wage structure from the communist to the market system. We also ask whether the institution of the minimum wage {{played a role in the}} level of inequality and its change over time. We find that wage inequality rose moderately, and more for men than for women. Applying the DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996) decomposition method we learn that changes in the wage structure explain almost the entire rise in inequality. We identified significant increases in the returns to human <b>capital</b> and <b>widening</b> wage differentials among industrial activities and ownership types, but these differentials were not significantly different for men and women. Although relatively less important in its impact, changes in the composition of the labor force did affect the change in inequality. If the labor force in 2003 had the same worker characteristics as the labor force in 1986, overall inequality would have been even higher in 2003. The younger, less-educated workers, and those working in agricultural or industrial activities, the state sector and large firms were more likely to have left the labor force by 2003, with some differences between men and women. Finally, we find that the minimum wage did indeed play a role in lowering inequality from what it might have been, but only for women...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} two symmetric countries/regions which trade in final goods. In each country is active {{the manufacturing sector}} and both vertical and horizontal innovation conduced by individuals with heterogenous ability.

However, {{it may be the}} case that globalization reduces the per-capita output growth rate of each region, but has positive effect on output level. Moreover, when a region has larger domestic market it also has higher human capital accumulation, higher skill premium, and higher per-capita mass of product lines, i. e. the country with larger domestic market invents a larger mass of varieties. This implies that skilled labor force residing in larger domestic market benefits of higher consumption flows. I show that even if a country has larger domestic market full agglomeration of either activity does not happen : both the regions remain active in both manufacturing and R&D.

40|$|The {{persistent}} {{increase in}} oil prices {{over the past decade}} suggests that global oil markets have entered a period of increased scarcity. Given the expected rapid growth in oil demand in emerging market economies and a downshift in the trend growth of oil supply, a return to abundance is unlikely in the near term. This chapter suggests that gradual and moderate increases in oil scarcity may not present a major constraint on global growth in the medium to long term, although the wealth transfer from oil importers to exporters would increase <b>capital</b> flows and <b>widen</b> current account imbalances. Adverse effects could be much larger, depending on the extent and evolution of oil scarcity and the ability of the world economy to cope with increased scarcity. Sudden surges {{in oil prices}} could trigger large global output losses, redistribution, and sectoral shifts. There are two broad areas for policy action. First, given the potential for unexpected increases in the scarcity of oil and other resources, policymakers should review whether the current policy frameworks facilitate adjustment to unexpected changes in oil scarcity. Second, consideration should be given to policies aimed at lowering the risk of oil scarcity. The main authors of this chapter are Thomas Helbling (tea...|$|R
40|$|University is a {{place where}} skilled labour is {{produced}} for societal and global consumption. This is premised on the fact that education provided at this level enhances human <b>capital</b> development which <b>widens</b> employment opportunities. However, there seems to be disparity over the skills required and those possessed by graduates from Nigerian universities. As a result, many university graduates are either underemployed or unemployed. The study adopted descriptive survey research design. Using stratified and simple random sampling techniques, a total of 300 employers of labour drawn from the manufacturing, banking and finance, education, and telecommunication industries in Lagos State constituted the sample frame. A Skill Assessment Questionnaire (SKAQ) was designed to elicit information from the participants. The results obtained showed that skills required of university graduates as perceived by employers were analytic and problem solving (98 %), decision – making (98. 3 %), risk management (96. 7 %), leadership (98 %), information and communication (97. 7 %), team-work (99 %), official communication (97. 7), and English proficiency and literacy skills (97 %) while skills possessed by university graduates were English proficiency and literacy (58 %) and information and communication skills (53 %). These results showed disparity in both the employers required skills and those possessed by the university graduates.

40|$|Neo-liberal {{system has}} formed {{a new world order}} in order to {{overcome}} the last crisis, it experienced in 1980. This new formation –that is called globalization is basically the struggle of overcoming the recession in the world economy. The main tools that are used by globalization for solving the crisis are the followings; minimal state, privatization, de-regulation policies, international corporations, and so on. Globalization has reduced the area of public administration by proposing a minimal state and has opened the public spear to the private sector. Increasing public duties and expenses of prosperous state have been shown as the reason of 1980 crisis that is characterized by recession and stagflation. Thus, public services have been decreased to minimum, the duties that were done by government in the past have been opened to the private sector and the moving area of the <b>capital</b> has been <b>widened.</b> The basic qualifications of new public administration can be categorized as follows: - Government is a force that steer, not a force that row. It should be director instead of an actor. - Public duties should be reduced. - Good governance should absolutely be provided. This administrative method is formed by local administrator, the civil public agents, and entrepreneur community. - Citizen should be regarded as customer and customer satisfaction should be adapted. - The authorities of central administration should be transferred to local administrations. - Public administration should be transparent, countable, effective and efficient. - Total Quality, localness, customer oriented, legitimacy and propriety are the inalienable parts of the public duties. In conclusion, public administration has transformed to public management. This is a mentality in which consumer is more important than producers.

Taxes and social transfers cushioned much of this increase of market income inequality, with relatively small changes in inequality of household disposable income. But, given {{the weakness of the}} recovery in most countries, the income of the poorest 10 % of the population has continued to decline or to increase less than that of the richest 10 %. Relative income poverty – the share of people with less than half of median income of their country in each year – was broadly unchanged between 2007 and 2011. But “anchored poverty ” – with the value of the threshold fixed in real terms at the 2005 level – increased by 2 percentage points in the OECD area during this period, and by much more in countries most affected by the crisis such as Greece and Spain. A long-term pattern documented in previous OECD reports further intensified during the crisis-years: youth have replaced the elderly as the group experiencing the greater risk of income poverty.

40|$|Capitalism’s {{profound}} effect on society has encouraged economic and accounting historians to hypothesise {{about the importance of}} double entry bookkeeping to its development. According to Sombart the continual reinvestment of the profits earned depended on the existence of a capitalist form of double-entry bookkeeping that would allow investors and managers to measure the return on investments as a means of making rational business decisions. More recently, with particular reference to the English East-India Company Bryer has argued that the adoption of the capitalist form of double-entry bookkeeping was essential to resolving the social conflict between investing capitalist classes that arose with the rise of industrial capitalism in England in the late 17 th and 18 th centuries by providing the means to calculate the rate of return on socialised <b>capital.</b> This paper <b>widens</b> the historical context of these debates to The Netherlands in the early 17 th century by examining accounting practices of the Dutch East-India Company, the epitome of modern capitalism in motives, organization and funding. It establishes that, although the 17 th century Dutch were preeminent in Europe in their knowledge of the capitalist form of double-entry bookkeeping, at no time during the period covered by the first charter (1602 – 1623) of the Dutch East-India Company, or thereafter, did the domestic operations of the Company use this form of bookkeeping across all chambers. This meant that the investors did not have the necessary information that would have allowed them to calculate the return on their investments. Indeed, the Company’s investors neither expected nor demanded information to calculate the return on their investments and, hence, double-entry bookkeeping was not a necessary condition for Dutch capitalism in the manner suggested by Sombart, Weber and Bryer. Instead, the form which capitalism developed in The Netherlands recognised the social and economic impact of its unique geography which produced a society characterised by a monetary economy, a long tradition of joint ownership, and a free market for assets and capital rights...|$|R
