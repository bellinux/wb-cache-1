He chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 film The Wings of the Dove.|$|E

She selected Catherine Hardwicke to be the production designer, and worked closely with Martin and Hewlett during {{the making of the}} film. Tank Girl was filmed primarily in White Sands, New Mexico, and Tucson, Arizona. The film's critically praised soundtrack was assembled by <b>Courtney</b> <b>Love,</b> and the Rippers' makeup and prosthetics team was headed by Stan Winston. Winston's studio wanted to work on the project so much that they cut their usual prices in half {{in order to meet the}} film's budget.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Novoselic, Grohl, and <b>Courtney</b> <b>Love</b> {{formed the}} limited {{liability}} company Nirvana LLC to oversee all Nirvana-related projects. A 45-track box set of Nirvana rarities was scheduled for release in October 2001. However, shortly before the release date, Love filed a suit to dissolve Nirvana LLC, and an injunction was issued preventing the release of any new Nirvana material until the case was resolved. Love contended that Cobain was the band, that Grohl and Novoselic were sidemen, and that she signed the partnership agreement originally under bad advice. Grohl and Novoselic countersued, asking the court to remove Love from the partnership and to replace her with another representative of Cobain's estate.|$|E
5|$|Avril Lavigne is {{considered}} a highlight in the pop-punk and alternative pop-rock scene since she helped to {{paved the way for}} the success of female-driven punk-influenced pop music, such as Paramore, Skye Sweetnam, Fefe Dobson, Lillix, Kelly Osbourne, Krystal Meyers, Tonight Alive, Hey Monday, among others as being a direct result. She was compared to alternative female singer-songwriters of the 1990s such as Alanis Morissette, Liz Phair and <b>Courtney</b> <b>Love</b> and earned a reputation as the greatest female representative of pop-punk music, and also as one of the female singers who best represent 2000s rock music. Lavigne also was seen as a fashion icon for her skatepunk and rocker style. Songs like Sk8er Boi, He Wasn't and Girlfriend are frequently listed as one of the best pop-punk songs of all time, by different critics.|$|E

5|$|In early 1994, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a European tour. Nirvana's final concert took place in Munich, Germany, on March 1. In Rome, {{on the morning of}} March 4, Cobain's wife, <b>Courtney</b> <b>Love,</b> found Cobain unconscious in their hotel room and he was rushed to the hospital. A doctor from the hospital told in a press conference that Cobain had reacted to a combination of prescribed Rohypnol and of alcohol. The rest of the tour was cancelled. In the ensuing weeks, Cobain's heroin addiction resurfaced. An intervention was organized, and Cobain was convinced to admit himself into drug rehabilitation. After less than a week in rehabilitation, Cobain climbed over the wall of the facility and took a plane back to Seattle. A week later, on Friday, April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head at his home in Seattle.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was fired}} from the band later that year due to musical differences, via a fax from {{keyboard}} player Roddy Bottum; and Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance {{was brought in to}} record their next album. However, Spruance left the band before the subsequent tour, and was replaced by the band's keyboard roadie, Dean Menta. Reasons given for the change differ—the band claim Spruance was unwilling to commit to a long touring schedule in support of the album, whilst Spruance claims he was never meant to be a permanent member in the first place. Roddy Bottum also claims to have been mostly absent during this period, owing to the deaths of his father and Kurt Cobain, whose wife <b>Courtney</b> <b>Love</b> was a close friend of his and one of the temporary lead singers of the band before Chuck Mosely joined. Bottum's absence led to the album being written largely without keyboards. Around the recording of the album in 1994, Mike Patton also got married to Italian woman Cristina Zuccatosta.|$|E

50|$|The {{song was}} written and {{recorded}} in 1997 after Hole's reported hiatus in 1996 due to frontwoman <b>Courtney</b> <b>Love's</b> rising movie career. According to Love, cowriter Billy Corgan wrote the song's main guitar riff {{during his time}} at the Celebrity Skin sessions.|$|R
50|$|While {{the initial}} {{focus of the}} film was to explore the {{possible}} murder of Cobain, <b>Courtney</b> <b>Love's</b> refusal to license any of Cobain's music and her unwillingness to speak on camera was used by Broomfield as evidence of her censorship of free speech.|$|R
25|$|The co-headlining {{tour was}} {{conceived}} by Hole's management company, Q Prime. Hole singer <b>Courtney</b> <b>Love</b> teased {{the press that}} she aimed to launch a tour with Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette. However, Hole's management aggressively pursued Marilyn Manson's eponymous band, even amid the quarrel between Love and Manson. Both aired their objections in the press. Nevertheless, the groups agreed to tour together provided that costs and revenue were split 50/50.|$|E
25|$|Vincent's drug dealer. <b>Courtney</b> <b>Love</b> {{later said}} that Kurt Cobain was {{originally}} offered {{the role of}} Lance; if he had taken it, Love would have {{played the role of}} his wife. Tarantino denies that he ever met Cobain and insists he never offered him a role in the movie. Gary Oldman was the preferred choice among TriStar executives, based on his portrayal of drug-dealing pimp Drexl Spivey in Tarantino's True Romance (1993).|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} by The Guardian in 2011, Everett True contested: Kurt sang backing vocals on two songs. He wrote one B-side for Hole ("Old Age"), uncredited. And that was it. It {{would be just as}} accurate and misleading to say that <b>Courtney</b> <b>Love</b> wrote most of Nirvana's third album, In Utero: you can certainly see her influence in Kurt's lyrics. Before the pair met, it was often guesswork as to his intentions. Afterwards, his lyrics were far more direct.|$|E
50|$|The {{documentary}} {{begins as}} {{an investigation of}} the circumstances surrounding Cobain's death and the theories which sprung up afterwards.
