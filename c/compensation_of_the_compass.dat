50|$|At {{first sight}} it appears {{confusing}} to the novice user, for {{the numbers on}} <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> dial ascend in an anticlockwise direction. This is because <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> is used to determine dip and dip-direction of surfaces (foliations), and plunge and plunge-direction of lines (lineations). To use <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> one aligns <b>the</b> lid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> with <b>the</b> orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface to be measured (to obtain dip and dip direction), or <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> with <b>the</b> orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line (to obtain plunge and plunge direction). <b>The</b> <b>compass</b> must be twisted so that <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> becomes horizontal, as accomplished using the spirit level incorporated in it. <b>The</b> needle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> is then freed by using the side button, and allowed to spin until the damping action slows its movement, and then stabilises. The side button is released and the needle is then firmly held in place, allowing the user thereafter to conveniently read the orientation measured. One first reads the scale that shows the angle subtended by <b>the</b> lid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compass,</b> and then depending on the colour shown (red or black) <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> needle with <b>the</b> corresponding colour. Data are then recorded as (for example) 25°->333° (dip and dip-direction) or (plunge and plunge-direction).|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In medical {{education}} {{the focus has}} shifted from gaining knowledge to developing competencies. To effectively monitor performance in practice throughout the entire training, a new approach of assessment is needed. This study aimed to evaluate an instrument that monitors <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> competencies during postgraduate training in <b>the</b> setting <b>of</b> training <b>of</b> general practice: <b>the</b> Competency Assessment List (<b>Compass).</b> METHODS: <b>The</b> distribution <b>of</b> scores, reliability, validity, responsiveness and feasibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Compass</b> were evaluated. RESULTS: Scores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Compass</b> ranged from 1 to 9 on a 10 -point scale, showing excellent internal consistency ranging from. 89 to. 94. Most trainees showed improving ratings during training. Medium to large effect sizes (. 31 - 1. 41) were demonstrated when we compared mean scores of three consecutive periods. Content validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Compass</b> was supported by <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> a qualitative study using the RAND modified Delphi Method. <b>The</b> feasibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Compass</b> was demonstrated. CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> <b>Compass</b> is a competency based instrument that shows in a reliable and valid way trainees' progress towards <b>the</b> standard <b>of</b> performance. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: <b>The</b> programmatic approach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Compass</b> could be applied in other specialties provided that the instrument is tailored to specific needs of that specialism...|$|R

40|$|Several simple {{laboratory}} experiments {{have been conducted}} to study <b>the</b> dynamic behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vector-averaging current meter (VACM) compass and vane follower. They demonstrate that <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> and vane follower can be modeled as a damped linear harmonic oscillator for small-amplitude forcing. The combined eddy-current and bearing-friction torque nearly critically damps <b>the</b> free oscillation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> and vane follower. This frictional torque {{is proportional to the}} angular-velocity difference between the instrument magnet assembly and housing. Dynamic experiments on five compasses indicate a mean (undamped) resonant period of 3 – 5 s at 41 °N. Similar experiments on two vane followers indicate a resonant period of 2 – 3 s. For <b>the</b> VACM dynamic <b>compass</b> experiments, frictional torque allowed an angular oscillation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> housing to drive an oscillation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> magnet, and at resonant forcing, <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> magnet oscillates exactly in phase with its housing. For the VACM vane-follower experiments, angular motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vane magnet directly drove the vane follower. For resonant forcing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vane magnet, the vane-follower oscillation overshoots the forcing slightly and is 90 ° out <b>of</b> phase with <b>the</b> forcing. The damped linear harmonic oscillator model suggests that a small-amplitude angular forcing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> or vane-follower housing (which may occur in the field due to mooring motion) should not cause any error in the vector-averaged headings. However, periodic angular oscillations near <b>the</b> resonant frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> or vane follower could cause an error in <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vector-averaged velocity. Forcing at frequencies lower than the well-defined resonant frequencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instruments should have little effect since directional errors do not exceed <b>the</b> angular resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instruments at periods of ≥ 10 s...|$|R
