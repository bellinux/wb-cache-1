40|$|This article {{examines}} New Zealand print media representations of assisted reproductive and related biogenetic technologies, conceptualized as the products <b>of</b> a <b>concordance</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> between media workers and reproductive specialists, biogenetic scientists and consumers. Such concordance {{is evident in}} the predominant use of media frames of anecdotal personalization and technoboosterism, which typically amplify the voices of proponents of emerging technologies while marginalizing and delegitimizing counterdiscourses. Thus, the perspectives of consumers and 'expert' sources are privileged at the expense of a more balanced assessment of the value and social, ethical, legal and health implications of assisted reproductive and related biogenetic technologies. Source dependence also detracts from much-needed recognition of the professional and financial interests at stake in the growing privatization and commercialization of these technologies, and in the local context potentially undermines journalistic independence and integrity...|$|R
