25|$|In August 1963, Lair {{received}} {{an order to}} cut Route 7 between the Plain of Jars and the Vietnamese border. After Lair's training, PARU troopers, accompanying and directing 12 platoons of Hmong from their Special Guerrilla Units, infiltrated to a portion of Route 7 that ran along steep cliffs. The saboteurs planted double <b>cratering</b> <b>charges</b> in each of 120 demolition pits they dug, and exfiltrated. When the explosions blew {{in the middle of}} the night, two sections of clifftop road migrated downwards. Once again, Lair let Pop Buell claim credit. The Route 7 communist supply line would remain cut until November.|$|R
