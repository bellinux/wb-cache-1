5|$|A {{major change}} in the {{training}} programme occurred in 1943. From that point on training concentrated more on the assault infantry role and less on raiding operations. Training now included how to <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>fire</b> support from artillery and naval gunfire, and how to obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E

2500|$|An hour later, {{following}} Collins' new {{deadline of}} 15:00, Deyo ordered cease fire and began {{withdrawing from the}} bombardment area. Group 2 headed back to Portland, England, at 15:01. Flagship Tuscaloosa took another <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>fire.</b> The targets were 75 mm field guns in casemates, on the dock {{at the entrance to}} Cherbourg's naval arsenal.

2500|$|At 12:12, {{the first}} <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>fire</b> {{came in from}} VII Corps shore fire control parties. Following their corrections, Nevada and Quincy took out the {{fortified}} target in 25 minutes. They continued with targets of opportunity for about three hours. Tuscaloosa was distributing its fire among targeted strong points directed by shore fire control, when flak hit its two Spitfires and {{they were forced to}} retire. In the first hour, Ellyson identified coastal battery fire nearby the town of Gruchy. Glasgow and her air spot silenced it with 54 rounds.

2500|$|In {{the first}} half of June, the {{squadron}} moved into a position about [...] west of the Brandi Plantation and here they came into close contact with a force of Japanese that had been forced out from Wewak and were attempting to raid Australian positions in the hope of gathering supplies. Casualties and losses from illness had been heavy and the squadron had been reduced to roughly half its effective strength, regardless the squadron maintained the pressure on the Japanese in the hills to the south through a program of aggressive patrolling. On 5 June 1945, a full squadron attack was launched upon a complex of Japanese bunkers that was discovered about [...] south of the Australian perimeter. Only 70 men could be mustered for the attack and when they encountered heavy machine gun fire from the bunkers, they were forced to withdraw and <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>fire</b> support from the artillery of the 2/2nd Field Regiment at Boram. In less than 10 minutes, over 800 shells were fired by the 16 guns of the 2/2nd Field Regiment and the result was devastating, as 17 of the 25 Japanese bunkers were totally destroyed. Japanese casualties were estimated at being at least 32 dead.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{many of the}} conex bunkers, the B-TOC was {{of wooden}} {{construction}} and [...] "weatherproofed with tar, so it burned rapidly." [...] After <b>calling</b> <b>for</b> <b>fire</b> support, Doyle made the decision around 0251 to evacuate the burning structure, and ordered the command staff to relocate to the aid station. Prior to shifting the radios, Captain Paul Spilberg <b>called</b> <b>for</b> artillery <b>fire</b> [...] "fifty meters out, three-hundred-and-sixty degrees around our position." [...] Once the radios had been established at the aid station, he and Col Doyle discovered that Charlie Company's CP (the designated alternate location for the battalion command post) had been hit and partly destroyed.|$|R
50|$|On 18 August 1968, an AC-130 gunship flying {{an armed}} {{reconnaissance}} mission in Vietnam's III Corps was diverted {{to support the}} Katum Special Forces Camp.

40|$|All {{comments}} from the 5 October 1993 ARI in-house review of the draft report have been incorporated, with the following exceptions: a. Reviewer's RECOMMENDATION [...] page 4, comment 6 a: This section understates the observed advantages of CVCC. For example, the number of <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>fire</b> doubles, triples, and even quadruples in a stage where CVCC is available. If artillery missions were available, we should see a corresponding increase in some amount in the volume of artillery fires delivered and in the kills achieved by artillery. RESPONSE: The narrative has been modified {{as far as possible}} given the current set of measures. Unfortunately, it is neither possible to reliably quantify the volume of of <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>fire</b> using current data, nor is it possible to establish the number of missions fired, and any kills attributed to those missions. Furthermore, given the differences in methods of employment and effects between SIMNET and real-world artillery, any focus on artillery effect in SIMNET would probably be inappropriate...|$|R
60|$|Now, for thy better {{performing}} {{this piece}} of service for our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: O it is hard work to pocket up the reproaches of all the foolish people, {{as if we had}} found great spoil; and to suffer all their revilings, lies, and slanders, without cursing them, as Elisha did the children; to answer them with prayers and blessings for their cursings. It is far more easy to give them taunt for taunt, and reviling for reviling; to give them blow for blow; yea, to <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>fire</b> from heaven against them. But to 'bless them that curse you, and to pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you'--even of malice, of old grudge, and on purpose to vex and afflict our mind, and to make us break out into a rage--this is work above us; now our patience should look up to unseen things; now remember Christ's carriage to them that spilt his blood; or all is in danger of bursting, and thou of miscarrying in theses things. I might here also dilate upon Job's case, and the lesson God set him, when, at one stroke, he did beat down all (Job 1:15), only spared his life, but made that also so bitter to him that his soul chose strangling rather than it (Job 7:15). O when every providence of God unto thee is like the messengers of Job, and the last to bring more heavy tidings than all that went before him (Job 1); when life, estate, wife, children, body, and soul, and all at once, seem to be struck at by heaven and earth; here are hard lessons; now to behave myself even as a weaned child, now to say, 'The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord' (Job 1:21). Thus, with few words, Job ascribeth righteousness to his Maker; but though they were but few, they proceeded from so blessed a frame of heart, that causeth the penman of the Word to stay himself and wonder, saying, 'In all this Job sinned not' with his lips, 'nor charged God foolishly.' In all this--what a great deal will the Holy Ghost make of that which seems but little when it flows from an upright heart! and it indeed may well be so accounted of all that know what is in man, and what he is prone unto.|$|E
