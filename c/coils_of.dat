40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} investigation <b>of</b> the <b>coiling</b> <b>of</b> a filament of a {{yield stress fluid}} falling on a solid surface. We use two kinds of yield stress fluids, shaving foam and hair gel, and show that the <b>coiling</b> <b>of</b> the foam {{is similar to the}} <b>coiling</b> <b>of</b> an elastic rope. Two regimes <b>of</b> <b>coiling</b> (elastic and gravitational) are observed for the foam. Hair gel coiling, on the other hand, is more like the <b>coiling</b> <b>of</b> a liquid system; here we observe viscous and gravitational regimes. No inertial regime is observed for either system because of instabilities occurring at high flow rates or the breakup of the filament from large heights...|$|R
30|$|According to Eq. (18), the {{magnetic}} flux {{of the air}} gap in the x direction produced by the control <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> the y direction is approximately 1 / 20 of {{the magnetic}} flux produced by the control <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> the x direction. Similarly, the magnetic flux of the air gap in the y direction produced by the control <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> the x direction is approximately 1 / 20 of the magnetic flux produced by the control <b>coil</b> <b>of</b> the y direction. Thus, the mutual coupling of magnetic flux in the radial two DOFs (x and y directions) can be ignored.|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{physical}} processes can depend substantially on the dimensionality of a system. One such example are buckling instabilities, which {{arise from the}} competition between axial compression and bending in elastic filaments.

25|$|A {{multiple}} coil magnet is an electromagnet {{that has}} several <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> wire connected in parallel. This increases the total electric current in the electromagnet and therefore generates a stronger magnetic field. It {{was invented by}} American scientist Joseph Henry in 1831.|$|E
25|$|An {{electronic}} component that {{is intended to}} add inductance to a circuit is called an inductor. Inductors are typically manufactured from <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> wire.

25|$|Ericoid mycorrhizas are {{the third}} of the three more ecologically {{important}} types. They have a simple intraradical (grow in cells) phase, consisting of dense <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> hyphae in the outermost layer of root cells. There is no periradical phase and the extraradical phase consists of sparse hyphae that don't extend very far into the surrounding soil.

25|$|Electric {{generators}} {{were known}} in simple forms from {{the discovery of}} the magnetic induction of electric current in the 1830s. In general, some form of prime mover such as an engine or the turbines described above, drives a rotating magnetic field past stationary <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> wire thereby turning mechanical energy into electricity. A very large 2000 Mw(2,682,000 horsepower) unit designed by Siemens was built for unit 3 at the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant. The only commercial scale electricity production that does not employ a generator is solar PV.|$|E
25|$|Most Cucuteni-Trypillia pottery was hand coiled {{from local}} clay. Long <b>coils</b> <b>of</b> clay {{were placed in}} circles to form first the base and then {{the walls of the}} vessel.

This technique was the earliest form of pottery shaping and the most common in the Neolithic; however, {{there is some evidence that}} they also used a primitive type of slow-turning potter's wheel, an innovation that did not become common in Europe until the Iron Age.|$|E

There are also several temples in India solely for cobras sometimes called Nagraj (King of Snakes) and {{it is believed that}} snakes are symbols of fertility.
