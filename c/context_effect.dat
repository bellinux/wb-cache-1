2500|$|The {{question}} whether the presentation of words in a sentence context restricts lexical access to words of the target language only are most studied in bilinguals' second language (L2) processing. This sentence <b>context</b> <b>effect</b> might be an efficient strategy to speed up lexical search, because it reduces the number of lexical candidates. For example, Elston-Guttler et al. showed that cross-lingual activation is very sensitive {{to the influence of}} a sentence context and previous activation state of the two languages in a semantic priming study. In their study, German-English bilinguals were presented with relatively low-constraint sentences in which a homograph (e.g., The woman gave her friend a pretty GIFT; gift means poison in German) or a control word was presented at the end (e.g., The woman gave her friend a pretty SHELL). [...] "Constraint" [...] means {{the degree to which the}} sentence frame preceding the target word biased that word. The sentence was then replaced by a target word (poison) for lexical decision task. They found that only for participants who saw a German film prior to experiment and only in the first block of the experiment, participants could recognize the target faster after primed with the related homograph sentence than primed with the controlled sentence. This suggests that bilinguals can quickly [...] "zoom into" [...] the L2 processing situation even the L1 activation was boosted.|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} and {{important}} for us to recognise facial expressions in our daily life. Research on recognition of facial expressions was often carried out using isolated faces, which leads us to ignore accompanied contextual information (e. g. vocal sound, body language). Chapter 4 used bodily and vocal expressions as contextual stimuli to investigate whether there are <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> on recognition of all six basic facial expressions. The results generally showed that recognition of facial expressions benefits from congruent contextual stimuli, while recognition of facial expressions is impaired by incongruent contextual stimuli. Chapter 5 examined whether the observed <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> vary with the level of intensity of facial expressions. The results showed that <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> are influenced by the level of intensity of facial expressions and revealed the opposite trend of the magnitude of facilitation effects and interference effects as level of intensity of facial expressions was increased. The following chapter 6 investigated another important aspect of <b>context</b> <b>effects,</b> that is, whether attentional resources influence the observed <b>context</b> <b>effects.</b> The results showed that the magnitude of <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> was reduced when the perceptual load of task-relevant tasks was increased, at least for <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> from bodily expressions to the recognition of disgusted facial expressions. All the data collected showed commonalities and differences in the pattern of <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> on recognition of facial expressions. Future studies might concentrate on the differences among these facial expressions to explore whether there exists a consistent pattern of <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> for all six facial expressions or to refine the existing models regarding recognition of facial expressions to better predict <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> for facial expression recognition...|$|R

50|$|A <b>context</b> <b>effect</b> is {{an aspect}} of {{cognitive}} psychology that describes the influence of environmental factors on one's perception of a stimulus. The impact of context effects {{is considered to be}} part of top-down design. The concept is supported by the theoretical approach to perception known as constructive perception. Context effects can impact our daily lives in many ways such as word recognition, learning abilities, memory, and object recognition. It can have an extensive effect on marketing and consumer decisions. For example, research has shown that the comfort level of the floor that shoppers are standing on while reviewing products can affect their assessments of product's quality, leading to higher assessments if the floor is comfortable and lower ratings if it is uncomfortable. Because of effects such as this, context effects are currently studied predominantly in marketing.|$|E

Model estimation results on choice-based conjoint data concerning digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence that the anticipated <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> exist in a repeated choice environment. Moreover, accounting for <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> leads to better predictions in holdout choice sets, including choice sets that are larger than the estimation sample choice sets.

40|$|Environmental <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> {{have not}} been {{consistently}} observed in studies of recognition memory. Several hypotheses have been generated to explain why this inconsistent pattern exists. Some hypotheses have focused on methodological issues, others concern how the environment is reinstated at test, and still others {{have focused on the}} nature of the contextual cues in relation to the cues associated with item information. A simpler hypothesis may explain this inconsistency and, in addition, suggest a novel approach with which to conceptualize <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> in recognition. This hypothesis focuses on the memory and decision components of recognition memory. Typically, <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> are found in hit and false-alarm rates and measures of response bias but not in measures of discrimination. From these findings, it appears as if context manipulations affect a person 2 ̆ 7 s decision strategy about the stimuli rather than their memory for the stimuli. ^ Decision strategy is measured through shifts in response-bias. Measures of response bias, however, are not usually reported in studies of <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> in recognition. Typically, the proportion of hits, and sometimes the proportion of false alarms, are reported to reflect memory performance in a changing-context situation. Without measures of discrimination and response bias, a complete explanation of <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> is not possible. ^ The discrimination and response bias explanation suggests that <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> in recognition memory should be measured with hit and false-alarm rates, measures of discrimination, and measures of response bias to give a complete explanation for the <b>context</b> <b>effects.</b> Four experiments were conducted to examine this explanation of <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> in recognition. Two experiments attempted to replicate previous studies that have identified reliable <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> in hit and false-alarm rates. Two additional experiments directly manipulated response bias to further explore how changes in response bias affect hit and false-alarm rates in addition to measures of discrimination and response bias. The findings from these experiments suggest that response bias may be the factor underlying <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> in recognition, but directly manipulating response bias only changes overall performance. It does not change performance differentially between the same and different contexts. ...|$|R
50|$|While the {{influence}} of media context on embedded ads undoubtedly exists and is important, it is complicated and difficult to evaluate. The related theories may be conflicting in this regard. For example, the Feelings-as-information Theory suggested that people in a positive mood tend to avoid stimuli such as ads. If people acquire a good mood {{as a result of}} processing media content, they may avoid paying attention to ads embedded in this context and process them less intensively. However, the Hedonic Contingency view stated that people in a positive mood may engage in greater processing of a stimulus because they believe that the consequences are going to be favorable. Given the complexity of the issue, a framework of media <b>context</b> <b>effect</b> on advertising response is demanded. One such endeavor is conceptualizing media engagement as an antecedent of the attitude toward the embedded advertisements.|$|E
50|$|The second <b>context</b> <b>effect</b> is the {{compromise}} effect. This effect occurs when an option C is added {{that is a}} compromise between X and Y. For example, when choosing between C = Honda and X = BMW, the latter is less economical but higher quality. However, if another option Y = Ford Focus {{is added to the}} choice set, then C = Honda becomes a compromise between X = BMW and Y = Ford Focus. Suppose in a binary choice, X (BMW) is chosen more often than C (Honda). But when option Y (Ford Focus) is added to the choice set, then option C (Honda) becomes {{the compromise}} between X (BMW) and Y (Ford Focus), and C is then chosen more frequently than X. This is another violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property because X is chosen more often than C in a binary choice, but C when option Y is added to the choice set, then C is chosen more often than X.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>context</b> <b>effect</b> is the {{similarity}} effect. This effect occurs {{with the introduction}} of a third option S that is similar to X but it is not dominated by X. For example, suppose X is a BMW, Y is a Ford focus, and S is an Audi. The Audi is similar to the BMW because both are not very economical but they are both high quality and sporty. The Ford focus is different from the BMW and Audi because it is more economical but lower quality. Suppose in a binary choice, X is chosen more frequently than Y. Next suppose a new choice set is formed by adding an option S that is similar to X. If X is similar to S, and both are very different from Y, the people tend to view X and S as one group and Y as another option. Thus the probability of Y remains the same whether S is presented as an option or not. However, the probability of X will decrease by approximately half {{with the introduction of}} S. This causes the probability of choosing X to drop below Y when S is added to the choice set. This violates the independence of irrelevant alternatives property because in a binary choice, X is chosen more frequently than Y, but when S is added, then Y is chosen more frequently than X.|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{investigated}} contextual influences on visual object processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) {{and failed to}} find reduced <b>context</b> <b>effects.</b> However, these studies did not properly account for local inter-object effects and/or the influence of post-perceptual processes, leaving it unclear whether individuals with ASD display equally large global top-down <b>effects</b> of <b>context,</b> or whether they rely on a more local mechanism producing the same result.

5000|$|The O'Shannon {{model of}} humor (OMOH) was {{introduced}} by Dan O'Shannon in [...] "What Are You Laughing At? A Comprehensive Guide to the Comedic Event", published in 2012. [...] The model integrates all the general branches of comedy into a unified framework. This framework consists of four main sections: context, information, aspects of awareness, and enhancers/inhibitors. Elements of context are in play as reception factors prior to the encounter with comedic information. This information will require a level of cognitive process to interpret, and contain a degree of incongruity (based on predictive likelihood). That degree may be high, or go as low as to be negligible. The information will be seen simultaneously through several aspects of awareness (the comedy’s internal reality, its external role as humor, its effect on its <b>context,</b> <b>effect</b> on other receivers, etc.). Any element from any of these sections may trigger enhancers / inhibitors (feelings of superiority, relief, aggression, identification, shock, etc.) which {{will have an impact}} on the receiver’s ultimate response. The various interactions of the model allow for a wide range of comedy; for example, a joke needn’t rely on high levels of incongruity if it triggers feelings of superiority, aggression, relief, or identification. Also, high incongruity humor may trigger a visceral response, while well-constructed word-play with low incongruity might trigger a more appreciative response.

On the other hand, Holt et al. [(2000). “Neighboring spectral content influences vowel identification,” J. Acoust. Soc.

The current study was to test a hypothesis that could explain the varying effectiveness of nonspeech contexts: <b>Context</b> <b>effects</b> are obtained only when there are well-established perceptual categories for the target stimuli.

In agreement with previous work <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> were obtained for speech contexts and targets but not for nonspeech analogs. Experiment 2 tested predictions of the hypothesis by testing for nonspeech <b>context</b> <b>effects</b> after the listeners had been trained to categorize the sounds.

Through five studies, I find that the <b>context</b> <b>effect</b> of a strong attitude object is greater for objects with neutral-strength attitudes than for the objects with very strong or very weak attitudes, which result in a curved relationship between {{the magnitude of the}} <b>context</b> <b>effect</b> and the strength associated with attitudes towards targets.

That is, the results of the context effects represent as a form of decreased extremity of the attitudes towards targets. More importantly, it is found that these differing magnitudes and directions of the <b>context</b> <b>effect</b> of an object with strong attitude finally result in evaluative space distortion. I trace the underlying process mechanism of theses effects and find that: 1) the divergent magnitudes of the context effects are the result of the differing level of comparison difficulty between a contextual object and target objects; and 2) the divergent directions of the context effects are the product of perceived uncertainty about the attitude towards target objects...|$|E
