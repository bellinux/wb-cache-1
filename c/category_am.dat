5000|$|Finally, it {{has been}} averred that ethical egoism is no better than bigotry in that, like racism, it divides people into two types—themselves and others—and discriminates against one type {{on the basis of}} some {{arbitrary}} disparity. This, to Rachels's mind, is probably the best objection to ethical egoism, for it provides the soundest reason why the interests of others ought to concern the interests of the self. [...] "What", he asks, [...] "is the difference between myself and others that justifies placing myself in this special <b>category?</b> <b>Am</b> I more intelligent? Do I enjoy my life more? Are my accomplishments greater? Do I have needs or abilities that are so different from the needs and abilities of others? What is it that makes me so special? Failing an answer, it turns out that Ethical Egoism is an arbitrary doctrine, {{in the same way that}} racism is arbitrary. ... We should care about the interests of other people for the very same reason we care about our own interests; for their needs and desires are comparable to our own." ...|$|E
