The trailers were built with integrated railroad wheelsets that could be lowered into position when the trailer was pulled behind a train. More modern roadrailers do not include integrated railroad wheels, but ride on regular trucks that do double-duty, serving as articulation points between multiple trailers in a train. Each regular truck is equipped with ONE fifth wheel {{at one end and}} a <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> at the other end. The <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> slides into a female receptacle on the rear of the trailer in front and is secured with a steel pin. At the head of a Road Railer train there is an adaptor truck equipped with one fifth wheel and one regular AAR Type [...] "E" [...] or Type [...] "F" [...] automatic coupler. Each semi-trailer has one king pin at each end. Because the truck (bogie) is significantly lighter than a rail flatcar or well-car, roadrailer freight trains are much lighter and therefore are more energy efficient than traditional intermodal trains.|$|E

Metal connector plates have integral teeth and are manufactured to various sizes (that is, length and width) and thickness or gauges and {{are designed to}} laterally transmit loads in wood. They are also known as stud ties, metal connector plates, mending plates, or nail plates. However, not all types of nail plates are approved for use in trusses and other structurally critical placements.|$|E

50|$|Train-derailment {{strategies}} varied {{considerably in}} their effectiveness. The Germans managed {{to repair the}} tracks quickly in agricultural areas with level ground, since the salvage of some matériel was a relatively easy proposition in such terrain. But unbolting a <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> on an outside rail in a mountainous area (given the higher speed of trains going downhill) {{could result in the}} derailment of an entire train with considerable amounts of front-ready matériel strewn far down the mountainside. Among the SNCF employees who joined the resistance, a subset were in Résistance-Fer which focused on reporting the movement of German troops to the Allied forces and sabotaging the railways' rolling stock as well as their infrastructure. Following the invasions of Normandy and Provence in 1944, the sabotage of rail transport became much more frequent and effectively prevented some German troop deployments to the front and hindered the subsequent retreat of German occupying forces.|$|E

Hybrid masonry {{construction}} has relatively recently been {{developed as a}} means to provide a more efficient use of masonry infill walls by designing these walls to function {{as a part of a}} structure's lateral force resisting system, with current applications in low seismic regions (Seismic Design Categories A, B, and C). In regions of higher seismicity (Seismic Design Categories D and greater), there exists a much greater need for a clearer understanding of the mechanics of the interaction between the steel frame of a building and the masonry shear wall as well as the development of specific detailing requirements to provide for a ductile and somewhat predictable response in a seismic event of significant magnitude. The scope of this thesis is the investigation of the connection between the steel beam and the top of the masonry wall for a Type I hybrid masonry system, using a proposed steel <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> through-bolted to the masonry wall bond beam, in order to provide preliminary guidelines and recommendations for the development of energy dissipating hybrid masonry connector plates. The first portion of this study focused on the development of <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> designs to determine which provided the most stable, ductile cyclic response. The second portion of this study investigated the strength and limit states of the through-bolted connection to the masonry wall bond beam under shear loading. Based on these experiments, recommendations are provided for the most suitable <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> designs as well as a general evaluation of the connection to the masonry wall and potential limit states to consider in future design applications. For a "rigid" connection between the steel frame and CMU wall, link connectors with a thickness greater than 0. 5 inches is recommended, whereas fuse Type T was proven to be superior for a ductile, energy dissipating <b>connector</b> <b>plate.</b> ACI 530 - 08 design values for bolt shear yielding and masonry shear failure were determined to be the most appropriate limit states for determining an approximate design values for the thru-bolted CMU wall connections...|$|E

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. In steel construction, {{there are}} various seismic {{structural}} systems that have been successfully utilized in the past including eccentric and concentric braced frames and moment frame systems. When these systems are used, the building envelope between structural members is filled with architectural components such as masonry infill walls, which are only expected to carry out of plane loads, such as wind, on each individual wall panel. Hybrid masonry {{is a relatively new}} type of structural system which incorporates the masonry infill walls within steel frames into the structural system to resist lateral loads imposed on the structure. This research represents the third phase of testing at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) and is part of an ongoing project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Research (NEESR) to investigate the applicability of hybrid masonry as an adequate structural system. In phases I and II of hybrid masonry <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> development research at UHM, a wide variety of connector designs were explored to determine the positive and negative aspects to different fuse and link <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> designs and connection methods. Fuse connector tests demonstrated the viability of tapered fuses to dissipate large amounts of energy during cyclic loading. These tests also showed that various practical connector orientations and methods can be applied for hybrid masonry connectors, particularly the straight bolted side plate connection. In addition, during phase I of testing, a series of bolt push out tests were performed to determine the shear strength of post-installed through-bolts in masonry. Observations from the first two phases of testing were used as a guide for selecting 4 -inch and 6 -inch tapered fuse designs for testing on partially grouted and fully grouted masonry wall specimens. Multiple pairs of both tapered fuse connectors were slip-critically bolted to side plates, which were welded to a steel beam above the masonry wall specimens. These tests were performed to verify that the behavior of multiple pairs of connector plates in series is similar to the behavior of the individual pairs of connector plates. In addition, the tests were performed to observe the interaction between the steel connector plates and masonry wall specimens. Based on numerous observations and results in this phase of testing, the design of Type I hybrid masonry connections was improved. The fuse connector tests showed that the strength and behavior of multiple pairs of fuse connectors can be approximated by designing a single <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> and multiplying the single plate's capacity by the number of connector plates used. These fuse connectors displayed the capability of dissipating large amounts of seismic energy before failure. Based on the results of these connector subassembly tests, recommended design procedures for connector plates were modified. Both masonry walls failed by means of shear friction at the location of the joint between the masonry and concrete slab. The results from UHM's testing will guide the development of full-scale two-story hybrid masonry test frames which will be tested at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign...|$|E

Heel joints were modeled with 60, one-quarter inch staples embedded in each model heel joint connection. The remaining truss connections were developed from projections based on tension splice joint and heel joint designs.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{increased}} use of metal-plate-connected (MPC) parallel-chord wood floor trusses calls for a corresponding emphasis {{on the need for}} fully disclosed research and testing of web/chord joint behavior. Standardized industry procedures utilizing parallel and perpendicular-to-grain joint tests have resulted in improper design values. Instances of <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> tooth-withdrawal in minimum five-year-old trusses have led to expensive repairs. Thirty-seven truss joint specimens removed from an existing apartment project were tested. Web/chord connections were found to have a mean ultimate strength of 165 N (37 lbF) per tooth, a value much lower than predicted by accepted standards. Trusses in additional projects were inspected and failing web/chord connections were calculated to have a mean ultimate capacity “at slip ” of 60 N (13. 5 lbF) to 67 N (15. 1 lbF). In some cases, application of standardized safety factors to tested ultimate strength values leads to allowable design values greater than observed slip values. Until adequate industry testing is performed and disclosed and adequate standards are developed, a maximum allowable design force of 20 N (4. 5 lbF) per tooth for 1. 0 mm (20 gauge) plates, regardless of plate manufacturer, is suggested...|$|E

A single inner module will be surrounded by 16 middle modules, which are surrounded by 16 outer modules. The 16 modules which comprise the middle ring are to be connected at the outer radius by a link, which is pinned to each front plate. The expected forces {{at each of the}} 16 connections vary from 1400 Ib to 69, 000 lb (Appendix 1).

The new systems will enhance and accelerate the replacement process of concrete bridge decks, and provide sufficient composite action to resist the horizontal shear at the girder-to-deck interface. The new systems include a debonded interface with formed shear key protruding from the precast girders and steel connectors for concrete girders; 11 4 in. diameter steel shear studs and a new 2 ̆ 2 dovetail 2 ̆ 2 shaped <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> for steel girder construction. ^ Test program consisting of horizontal shear push-off specimens, lab size beams, and full scale girders was conducted on all proposed connection schemes. Test results show that the debonded shear key system with steel connectors spaced at 24 in. {{along the length of the}} girder provides sufficient horizontal shear resistance utilizing the shear friction theory. The 11 4 in. diameter steel shear studs appears to have high fatigue resistance and higher α values as compared to both AASHTO Standard and AASHTO LRFD Specifications. The ultimate strength capacity of the 11 4 in. studs was found to be twice the capacity of the conventional 7 / 8 in. diameter studs. The testing conducted so far on the steel dovetail plate connector has demonstrated the viability of the new system. Its strength was found to depend upon the amount of reinforcement transverse to the plate connector. The dovetail connector does show merit as a possible standard composite connection method for all sizes of steel girder bridges.

The first step is to slice the microfluidic system design into individual layers so that each layer can be fabricated on a separate foil. The next step is the selection of the desired properties (e. g. hydrophilic, transparent …) for each foil, which depends on the functional requirements. In the third step these foils are laser processed on both sides, i. e. they are micro structured and functionalized. The final fourth step is laminating these individual foils into a multilayered system via thermal or plasma bonding. The multilayer technology is also applied to fabricate pneumatically actuated pumps and valves. For this purpose the design of these elements has to be adapted. // Microfluidic structures can be placed at different levels in the multilayer design, which results in greater functionality per chip area.
