30|$|In {{research}} on classroom curriculum {{there is a}} distinction between the “formal curriculum,” the “intended curriculum,” and the “enacted curriculum” (Remillard 2005; Tarr et al. 2008). The formal <b>curriculum</b> refers <b>to</b> that written by textbook publishers or outlined in school policies. The intended <b>curriculum</b> refers <b>to</b> teachers’ plans and aims for using the formal curriculum. The enacted <b>curriculum</b> refers <b>to</b> what teachers actually do with the curriculum in the classroom with their students. There is little debate that, as Remillard (2005) put it, teachers are “active users of curriculum materials and shapers of the enacted curriculum” (pg. 215).|$|R

5|$|The {{conservative}} {{tradition of}} the mosque, with its {{lack of attention to}} science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. A seminal innovation occurred with the introduction of printing presses to Egypt, finally enabling the <b>curriculum</b> <b>to</b> shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930. Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted into the curriculum. By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European philosophy was also added to the study program.|$|E
5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} {{a curriculum that}} required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the <b>curriculum</b> <b>to</b> a two-year vocational program.|$|E

5|$|English was the {{official}} language of Sarawak from 1963 to 1974 due to opposition from First Chief Minister of Sarawak Stephen Kalong Ningkan {{to the use of}} the Malay language in Sarawak. In 1974 the new Chief Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub recognised Malay alongside English as an official language of Sarawak. This new status given to the Malay language was further reinforced by new education standards transitioning <b>curriculum</b> <b>to</b> Malay. In 1985 English lost the status of an official language, leaving only Malay. Despite official policy, Sarawak opposition members argue that English remained the de facto official language of Sarawak. English is still spoken in the legal courts, and state legislative assembly. In 2015, Chief Minister Adenan Satem announced that English will be reinstated as an official language.|$|E

5|$|In 1876, the {{curriculum}} was widened {{so that it}} comprised reading, writing, arithmetic, English, mathematics, history, geography, Latin, a foreign language, music, natural science and drawing, with Greek as an optional extra. The County Council supported technical and commercial subjects in the late 19th century, but after 1904 it was empowered to support secondary education in general, allowing Latin and other classical components of the <b>curriculum</b> <b>to</b> remain intact. After World War I, sixth form courses were developed allowing students to commence advanced studies {{in the arts and}} sciences.
