5|$|He {{received}} regimental {{promotion to}} major in the 28th Foot on 9 May 1816. The regiment moved to a garrison posting in the Ionian islands in 1819, and {{his time in the}} islands saw him command a force which put down a local rising on Santa Maura. On 2 September 1819 he purchased the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel and command of the 92nd Gordon Highlanders. His tenure at the 92nd was short and contentious; since it was garrisoned in Jamaica, he did not actually join the regiment until October 1820, and then scandalised his officers and men by his approach to regimental traditions. He appeared on parade in a <b>cocked</b> <b>hat</b> rather than the conventional highland bonnet, and attempted to order the regiment to wear trousers rather than the kilt. The Duke of York quickly arranged for his transfer to a less sensitive role, and he was transferred to command the 90th Light Infantry, a Lowland—and safely trousered—regiment, on 9 August 1821. The 90th were in the Ionian Islands, where Stovin had been posted some years earlier, but his second tour was substantially quieter; he saw no further active service before he retired from the 90th on half-pay on 23 April 1829. For his services there, he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.|$|E

25|$|Military {{historian}} Richard Holmes {{remarked that}} Wellesley's experiences in India {{had an important}} influence on his personality and military tactics, teaching him much about military matters that would prove vital to his success in the Peninsular War. These included {{a strong sense of}} discipline through drill and order, the use of diplomacy to gain allies, and the vital necessity for a secure supply line. He also established a high regard for the acquisition of intelligence through scouts and spies. His personal tastes also developed, including dressing himself in white trousers, a dark tunic, with Hessian boots and black <b>cocked</b> <b>hat</b> (that later became synonymous as his style).|$|E

Since then, the use of full dress has been largely restricted to the Household Division, which maintains the tradition: quartermasters wear <b>cocked</b> <b>hats</b> with a feather of regimental colour, whilst Veterinary Officers and Medical Officers wear <b>cocked</b> <b>hats</b> with a red feather plume and black feather plume respectively.|$|R

25|$|In 1830, the Pulaski County {{regiment}} {{was ordered}} into a special muster {{for the purpose}} of being inspected by the governor. The regimental commander was a German immigrant by the name of Christian Brumbach. Brumbach, though conscientious, was given to ostentatious military display. His uniform was augmented with heavy gold lace and gilt bullet buttons topped off with a <b>cocked</b> <b>hat</b> and large plume. As the men formed for inspection, the commander discovered some were armed with hickory sticks while others shouldered umbrellas. As the governor's party passed in review, a thunderstorm erupted and, much to Commander Brumbach's dismay, many of the militiamen scurried for cover. Those armed with umbrellas remained in formation. The furious Brumbach, his plume drooping in the rain, ordered a court martial to try the runaways. They were each fined five dollars, and soon thereafter Christian Brumbach resigned his command and left Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the same}} basic uniform was worn by the heavy cavalry of the British Army at any given period, for centuries each {{regiment}} had its own distinctions and variations. The Scots Greys were no different. The most noticeable difference in the uniform of the Scots Greys was that the regimental full dress worn as general issue until 1914 included a bearskin cap. They were the only British heavy cavalry regiment to wear this fur headdress. Prior to receiving the bearskin, they were also unique among British cavalry regiments in wearing the mitre cap (sometimes {{referred to as a}} grenadier cap) instead of the <b>cocked</b> <b>hat</b> or tricorn worn {{by the rest of the}} British cavalry during the eighteenth century. The mitre cap dates back to the reign of Queen Anne, who awarded them this distinction after the Battle of Ramillies in 1706. An early form of the bearskin was adopted in 1768.|$|E
25|$|Emmet wore {{a uniform}} {{of a green}} coat with white facings, white breeches, top-boots, and a <b>cocked</b> <b>hat</b> with feathers. Failing to seize Dublin Castle, which was lightly defended, the rising {{amounted}} to a large-scale disturbance in the Thomas Street area. Emmet saw a dragoon being pulled from his horse and piked to death, the sight of which prompted him to call off the rising to avoid further bloodshed. But, he had lost all control of his followers. In one incident, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Lord Kilwarden, was dragged from his carriage and stabbed by pikes. Found still alive, {{he was taken to}} a watch-house where he died shortly thereafter. He had been reviled as chief prosecutor of William Orr in 1797, but he was also the judge who granted habeas corpus to Wolfe Tone in 1798. Kilwarden's nephew, the Rev. Mr. Wolfe, was also killed. Sporadic clashes continued into the night until finally quelled by British military forces.|$|E

[...] Amidst the sounds and textures Buechner recalls from his days in Bermuda, he writes of [...] "the sound and feel of English money—the heavy coppers and florins and half crowns that weighed down your pockets, the thin little sixpences and threepenny bits, the pound notes with the King's picture on them." [...] Traces of the United Kingdom were all around him: [...] "I remember the public library with a park behind it where a British regiment called the Sherwood Foresters gave band concerts underneath a huge India rubber tree, and a bookstore that smelled the way a new book printed in England does when you first open it." [...] That smell, [...] "faintly like nutmeg, dry, erudite," [...] stayed with Buechner the rest of his life. Details from the island's celebration of the coronation of George the Sixth—for which Buechner and his classmates [...] "helped drag brushwood {{to the top of a}} hill for a bonfire" [...] and went around [...] "lighting bonfires on all the hills in Bermuda"—appear throughout his memoirs.
