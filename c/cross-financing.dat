40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{efficiency}} of <b>cross-financing</b> new motorway or rail projects from established toll motorways {{as an alternative to}} direct public subsidies. For new motorway projects a combination of short-run marginal social cost pricing and <b>cross-financing</b> is the best of the alternative schemes tested for increasing overall welfare. Regarding the Lyon-Turin rail project, an alpine fund supplied by toll mark-ups on the Alpine motorways in combination with the same national transport fund as in the road case study, would eliminate the need for public subsidies and simultaneously improve the financial balances of the rail operator and manager. ...|$|E

5|$|After {{securing}} {{additional financing}} from Eurimages and ARTE, Tarr used these and the Hungarian funds to undertake nine days of shooting on sets {{he had built}} {{at a cost of}} €2 million. The French funding was <b>cross-financed</b> for the shoot by T. T. Filmműhely. As funds were frozen however, the Corsican subcontractor Tanit Films (controlled by the film's then-executive producer Jean-Patrick Costantini), terminated their contract with Balsan and through legal action compelled the production to dismantle the sets and leave the shooting location. At that point, Ognon Pictures shut the production down and disassociated themselves from the film, and Tarr withdrew to Hungary to regroup.|$|R
40|$|Previous papers {{tested the}} {{validity}} of the Family Investment Hypothesis (FIH) among immigrants by comparing the labor market outcomes of immigrant couples and native or mixed couples. Here we propose an alternative test for the FIH which is based on a comparison between married and single immigrants. The logic underlying this alternative method states that if credit constraints are binding, then only married immigrants can <b>cross-finance</b> their investment within the family. In order to overcome potential selection bias that would arise if unobserved characteristics that affect the marital status of the individual also affect his/her labor market outcomes, we construct a difference-in-differences estimator that exploits variation in the labor market outcomes of married and single natives. Implementation of this method using US and Israeli data leads to a rejection of the FIH in both countries. ...|$|R
25|$|While {{the global}} {{awareness}} and {{popularity of the}} Tour grew during this time, its finances became stretched. Goddet and Lévitan continued to clash over {{the running of the}} race. Lévitan launched the Tour of America, as a precursor to his plans to take the Tour de France to the US. The Tour of America lost a lot of money, and it appeared to have been <b>cross-financed</b> by the Tour de France. In the years before 1987, Lévitan's position had always been protected by Émilien Amaury, the then owner of ASO, but recently, Émilien Amaury had retired and his son Philippe Amaury was now responsible. When Lévitan arrived at his office on 17 March 1987, he found that his doors were locked and he was fired. The organisation of the 1987 Tour de France was taken over by Jean-François Naquet-Radiguet. He was not successful in acquiring more funds, and was fired within one year.|$|R
40|$|Today's {{insurance}} rates are often only a rough approximation {{of the actual}} risks they insure, categorizing insurance takers into coarse classes based on long-term demographic facts such as age or address. This not only negatively affects the care with which the insured good is treated, but also often implies {{a significant amount of}} <b>cross-financing</b> from low-risk customers to high-risk customer. By being able to measure the risk an insured good is subjected to in real-time, insurers could offer real-time {{insurance rates}} that would both encourage safe treatment of the insured good, as well as reward low-risk customers with lower insurances rates. The video presents the Smart Tachograph, an example of such a real-time risk-measurement system in the car insurance domain. It further demonstrates vividly how a risky driving style could significantly increase an individual's insurance rate...|$|E
40|$|Providing credits {{seems to}} be an {{effective}} tool for improving the welfare of the poor. It is expected that microcredit funding to poor people will expand rapidly over the coming years. If a sound monitoring mechanism is not developed, Wiig argues that such a credit expansion may create unintended negative effects. Based on a Grameen Bank study, three problems or dilemmas related to credit expansion are analysed: (i) Does a larger supply of microcredit increase the possibility of <b>cross-financing?</b> (ii) Does capital deepening tend to favour the best ("richest") of the poor? (iii) Does economic success lead to poor repayment behaviour? Survey methods revealing the extent of these problems are presented. It is argued that some of these methods should be replicated by the implementing agencies to improve the effectiveness of credit provision to the poor...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} economic {{problem of}} the media in general is neither recognized nor analyzed in detail. This is because literature on media economics mostly focuses upon the peculiarity of specific media industries, ignoring common characteristics and not discovering the common economic environment. Due to the specific cost conditions corresponding to those of a natural monopoly, media "makers" operate between two extremely different situations-between market failure and economic techniques altering market imperfections into workable markets by using what here is termed as "cross-financing. " This economic principle, quite different from "cross-subsidization," constitutes the main issue of the following considerations. This analysis provides a theoretical and empirical framework to discuss three aspects: a) the emergence of latent market-failure situations, b) the conditions for adequate strategies of the media, and c) the abundance of <b>cross-financing</b> techniques. The empirical data concerning cost and financial accounting represent case studies. The theoretical approach takes {{a closer look at the}} industrial organization, especially of the periodical print media on a microeconomic, that is, socioeconomic level. ...|$|E
5000|$|Lévitan {{continued}} to look for sponsors and saw a chance to attract money from the United States when in 1981 Jonathan Boyer, sometimes known as Jacques Boyer, became the first American to ride the Tour. Lévitan capitalised on the transatlantic interest he expected by encouraging Boyer to ride not in his sponsor's jersey but in the stars and stripes, normally reserved for the American national champion. Lévitan dreamed of a Tour of America, which was born in 1983 and died of enormous losses. The organisation had been delegated to Philippe Riquois, a business associate of Bernard Hinault whose agency handled the TV rights to the Tour de France outside Europe. Lévitan had been a favourite with Émilien Amaury, who now owned not just Parisien Libéré but L'Équipe as well. But when he died, his son Philippe, bitter over illegal inheritance arrangements {{that his father had}} tried to make, took a less charitable view of those his father had appointed. On 17 March 1987 Lévitan was called to a meeting in the board room in which the Tour's first organiser, Henri Desgrange had first had the suggested to him the words [...] "Tour de France." [...] A complicated financial discussion ensued. At stake was the losses entailed by the Tour of America. The claim was that it had been <b>cross-financed</b> by the Tour de France. Lévitan insisted he was innocent but the lock to his office was changed and he arrived at work 17 March 1987, to find his job was over.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the film was problematic, with threats {{to shut down the}} production, lack of financing, and ultimately a return to work. The project first faltered in February 2005, when the film's producer Humbert Balsan committed suicide. Tarr reported receiving word of his producer's death two days before shooting was scheduled to begin in Bastia, Corsica. Balsan's death led to significant financial difficulties for the production. The film had been established as a co-production with French, German and Hungarian financing. Tarr's Budapest-based production company T. T. Filmműhely were to provide the Hungarian funding for the project, while Balsan had secured the French and German financing for the film by warranting a loan from the French bank Coficiné. Upon learning of his death, the bank withdrew its support for the production, which was then postponed. So this is where we are at this moment. The agreement with Ognon and Coficiné has been concluded, the signed contract has been submitted to the court in Paris and we shall soon start shooting the film which is now relieved from the burden of the past.We sincerely hope that the descent to hell and the humiliation is over, finally we can switch off the light in the projection hall, and we can see {{what it was all about}} after all.Because what is made ready from this shooting of half an hour or so is something that makes all of us burst with pride! Press release by director Béla Tarr and producer Gábor Téni, February 6, 2006. After securing additional financing from Eurimages and ARTE, Tarr used these and the Hungarian funds to undertake nine days of shooting on sets he had built at a cost of €2 million.

40|$|The {{transport}} of road goods across the Alps constitutes a problem both for European transportation {{and for the}} Alpine environment. Austria and Switzerland have {{made a number of}} attempts to decelerate the growth in lorry transit volume and shift transport onto the rail modes. After ten years, such efforts can be deemed to have failed. The envisaged new rail lines across the Alps should procure higher transport capacities and shorter transport times for the railways, but will hold their own against the road only when the transport flow is improved and prices are kept down. Accordingly, it will be virtually impossible for the railways to pay the full cost of transalpine transit links. In Switzerland, much of the financing burden of the rail infrastructure investments is shifted onto road transport. In Austria, the <b>cross-financing</b> permitted under the "Eurovignette" Directive will cover {{only a small fraction of}} the actual investment costs of the planned new Brenner tunnel. An ecologically sustainable and economically efficient solution proposed is to set up a quota scheme for Alps-crossing lorries in the form of emission certificates which are to be auctioned and traded. road transport transalpine transit quota scheme alps-crossing emission certificates...|$|E
40|$|The Family Investment Hypothesis (FIH) {{assumes that}} credit-constrained {{immigrant}} families adopt upon arrival a household strategy {{in order to}} finance their post-immigration human capital investment such that one spouse invests in host country-specific human capital while the other undertakes labor market activities to finance their current consumption. Previous attempts to test the FIH were based on comparisons between the labor supply and wage profiles of immigrant couples and native couples. In this paper we propose an alternative evaluation of the FIH {{which is based on}} a comparison between married immigrants and single immigrants. The motivation for our approach is that if credit constraints are binding, then a married immigrant has the option of <b>cross-financing</b> his investment within the family while a single immigrant does not have this option. However, if individuals are self-selected to marriage with respect to their unobserved characteristics and these unobservables affect labor outcomes, the direct comparison between married and single immigrants would lead to a specious inference on the validity of the FIH. To control for such a possible selection, we exploit variation in the labor supply and wages of married and single natives, who are not expected to face binding liquidity constraints, in order to construct a difference in differences (hereby Dif-in-Dif) estimate for the evaluation of the FIH. Furthermore, we show that the conventional examination of the FIH which compares immigrant couples to native couples emerge as a special case of our estimate if there are no differences between the labor supply and wages of single immigrants to those of single natives. We implement our empirical strategy using micro data on the U. S. and Israel and find that in both countries the FIH does not hold...|$|E
40|$|With the {{implementation}} of {{the first phase of the}} Gautrain and Rea Vaya Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems in Gauteng in 2009, and that of Cape Town's MyCiti BRT system in 2010, the major focus related to planning, design and construction aspects have been on the systems' physical and operational characteristics, and their cost implications. The novelty of the first 'new generation' public transport system of note to be implemented in SA cities, the fractious interactions with the taxi industry, and concerns with cost escalations have obscured discussions around the potential significant long term impact that these systems could have on the land use and accessibility patterns of our cities. This is of significance given that these inequitable and dysfunctional patterns inherited from apartheid have proved entrenched and largely immune to spatial restructuring initiatives by planning authorities following its formal demise. This paper will specifically explore the restructuring potential, together with the value enhancement and capture aspects of BRT and rapid rail systems, based on precedent in cities of relevant contexts in South America, i. e. the opportunities for densification intensification of land uses along public transport corridors, the extent of value capture possible, private sector development responses, public sector intervention to make e. g. affordable housing opportunities available, and <b>cross-financing</b> opportunities (to help fund capital and/or operational costs). It will explore planning/ land use management authorities' responses to pro-actively engage with potential public transport - land use interaction dynamics within policy frameworks, i. e. how are land value enhancements (increments) best mobilised to fulfil a range of (potentially competing) objectives. Finally, the paper will explore the potential of public transport as part of a package of critical ingredients in fostering more compact forms of development, specifically in the South African context which present a number of unique challenges, including high levels of inequality, major concerns with public security, increasing trend towards containment in security villages, and private mobility as an aspirational lifestyle choice.
