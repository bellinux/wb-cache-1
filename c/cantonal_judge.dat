25|$|In January 1802, patriots (unitarians) {{from several}} smaller cantons met in Aargau {{to find ways}} to ensure the {{revolution}} of 1798 was not undone by the federalists, and started plotting a new coup for spring 1802. In preparation for this new uprising, several actions were planned, and after the two Vaudois delegates returned to their homes, emissaries went from village to village stirring up popular anger against the symbols of the old regime. These efforts were apparently driven by several {{of the members of the}} tribunals who had been replaced following the 1800 address, like Claude Mandrot or former <b>cantonal</b> <b>judge</b> Potterat.|$|E

His father served in the Swedish Army as a judge-advocate but also worked as a {{civilian}} lawyer, farmer and assistant <b>cantonal</b> <b>judge.</b> His mother Beata Jacquelina Charlotta Christiana Nisbeth died a year after his death.|$|E

50|$|The Federal Supreme Court numbers 19 deputy judges, who {{are also}} elected by the Federal Assembly. Of the deputy judges {{currently}} sitting on the bench, three have Italian, six French and 11 German as their native language. Nine of the deputy judges are women. The deputy federal judges serve in a part-time capacity, otherwise they are professors, practicing lawyers or <b>cantonal</b> <b>judges.</b> As a general rule, they serve asreplacements for judges who have recused themselves or have taken ill, or when the Court’s docket has become overly full. In the proceedings on which they sit {{they have the same}} rights and obligations as the ordinary federal judges.|$|R
50|$|In 1891 a {{small group}} of eminent persons {{obtained}} a concession {{for the construction of a}} railway line between Spiez and Frutigen with the option of later extending it into the Valais. A retired member of the <b>cantonal</b> government and <b>judge,</b> Wilhelm Teuscher studied route options and concluded that the current route was feasible. On 25 July 1901 the railway was opened from Spiez to Frutigen as the Spiez-Frutigen-Bahn (SFB) as the first stage of the Lötschberg line.|$|R
40|$|Two new {{enforcement}} instruments As of January 2009, Dutch municipalities {{can make}} use of two new instruments for out-of-court settlements of public order violations: the ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikking overlast’ and the ‘bestuurlijke boete overlast’. These instruments give local law enforcers the authority to issue an penalty for minor punishable offences such as stray dogs, dog droppings, household waste dumps or violation of other local bylaws. In {{the case of the}} ‘bestuurlijke boete’ the municipality is responsible for the administrative process. In the case of the ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikking overlast’, the municipality sends the written charge (‘proces-verbaal’) to the Central Fine Collection Agency (‘Centraal Justitieel Incassobureau or CJIB) after which the CJIB sends a copy of the charge with a giro payment slip to the accused. If the accused refuses to pay the penalty, the case is submitted to the public prosecutor for further judgement. After that, the case can be brought to court. If the fine is paid, the case will not be evaluated by the public prosecutor. Evaluation Three years after the introduction of both instruments, this evaluation has been conducted. To what extent have both instruments been implemented by municipalities? What are the results of the instruments and of the financial compensatory allowance scheme? To answer these questions, DSP-groep has conducted research from November 2011 to April 2012 for the Scientific Research and Documentation Center (WODC) of the Ministry of Security and Justice. The legal framework and the legal and political reasoning resulting in the introduction of both instruments has been studied by Prof. Mr. Dr. Arthur Hartmann of Erasmus University, Rotterdam. DSP-groep conducted the rest of the research: a survey among Dutch municipalities in which 301 municipalities participated (72 % response), in-depth interviews with 23 representatives of six municipalities and representatives of the CJIB, the Central Processing Unit of the Public Prosecution Service (CVOM) and the Ministries of Security and Justice and the Ministry of the Interior. In addition, DSP-groep has performed a quantitative analysis on a database containing all ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikkingen overlast’ issued between early 2009 and February 2012 (over 50. 000 cases). The CVOM has analysed all cases that have been evaluated by the Public Prosecution Service and <b>cantonal</b> <b>judges.</b> An independent committee has supervised the progress and quality of the research. The survey among Dutch municiplaities is part of this dataset. The in-depth interviews, and the database containing all ‘bestuurlijke strafbeschikkingen overlast’ are not available...|$|R
