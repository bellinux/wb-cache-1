40|$|Bt hybrids {{can be an}} {{important}} tool in the integrated management of Fusarium ear rot and possibly Aspergillus ear rots and maize stalk rots. New Bt hybrids now under development promise to provide more complete control of corn earworm and fall armyworm, which should enhance their effects on insect-associated fungi. New events also are being developed for control of coleopteran pests such as corn rootworms (Diabrotica spp.). Control of corn rootworms has the potential to reduce stalk rot by maintaining better root health and reducing physical damage to the roots where the stalk rot fungi can enter the plant. Coleopterans that feed on maize ears and silks, such as adult <b>corn</b> rootworms and <b>sap</b> <b>beetles</b> (family Nitidulidae) can contribute to ear rot (6). If new transgenic hybrids are resistant to these insects, there could be further contributions toward mycotoxin management. Transgenic control of insects and diseases offers an alternative that is much more effective, consistent, economical, and environmentally sound than foliar insecticides...|$|R

The beetle {{is a serious}} pest in the northeastern United States, with growers in multiple states reporting closing fields for picking prematurely due to fruit damage. Three options were evaluated for potential to reduce strawberry <b>sap</b> <b>beetle</b> populations. First, the influence of plant structure on accessibility of fruit in different strawberry cultivars to strawberry <b>sap</b> <b>beetle</b> was assessed by modifying plant structure and exposing caged plants to strawberry <b>sap</b> <b>beetle</b> adults. Severity of damage to berries staked {{up off the ground}} was similar to damage to those fruit contacting the soil, showing that adults will damage fruit held off the ground. Second, baited traps were placed at three distances into strawberry fields to determine whether overwintered beetles enter strawberry fields gradually. Adult beetles were first caught in the strawberries ≈ 19 d after occurring in traps placed along edges of adjacent wooded areas. The beetles arrived during the same sampling interval in traps at all distances into the fields, indicating that a border spray is unlikely to adequately control strawberry <b>sap</b> <b>beetle.</b> Third, the number of strawberry <b>sap</b> <b>beetle</b> emerging from strawberry for 5 wk after tilling and narrowing of plant rows was compared in plots renovated immediately at the end of harvest and in plots where renovation was delayed by 1 wk. In the 2 -yr study, year and not treatment was the primary factor affecting the total number of emerging strawberry <b>sap</b> <b>beetle.</b> Overall, limited potential exists to reduce strawberry <b>sap</b> <b>beetle</b> populations by choosing cultivars with a particular plant structure, applying insecticide as a border spray, or modifying time of field renovatio...|$|R

The device was baited with the pheromone and coattractants for the dusky <b>sap</b> <b>beetle</b> (Carpophilus lugubris Murray) and placed in the field in the fall of each year. The introduced strain occurred at high frequency among the B. bassiana isolated in the fall of all four years tested (100 % of all isolates from 21 of 22 collection dates). The introduced strain of B. bassiana was isolated at high frequency from all the B. bassiana-contaminated <b>sap</b> <b>beetles</b> recovered from the overwintering traps (100 % of all isolates from 13 of 23 trap/beetle species combinations) and was highest after the longest fall exposure. The introduced strain was primarily isolated from C. lugubris and C. antiquus, but species distribution was also dependent on the overwintering trap design used. Few non-sap beetles species of insects were recovered from the artificial overwintering sites. Although B. bassiana was isolated from free flying <b>sap</b> <b>beetles</b> caught in traps in the spring of each year, none were infected with the introduced strain. The autoinoculating device provides selective contamination of <b>sap</b> <b>beetles</b> in overwintering sites when used in the fall.

40|$|The {{matrix of}} {{strawberry}} and alternate host crops, wooded areas, and uncultivated sections that comprises a farm landscape provides not only food resources but also habitat in both a {{spatial and temporal}} context. Reports of the strawberry <b>sap</b> <b>beetle</b> as a pest in strawberry in the northeastern United States have increased along with a trend to produce a wider diversity of fruit crops on individual farms. The three objectives of this study focused on determining which, if any, habitats outside strawberry plantings are important to consider when developing control strategies for strawberry <b>sap</b> <b>beetles.</b> First, sampling of wooded areas and multiple crops showed that strawberry <b>sap</b> <b>beetles</b> overwinter not only in wooded areas but also in blueberry and raspberry. No overwintering beetles were found in strawberry. Second, up to a 70 -fold increase in mean number of strawberry <b>sap</b> <b>beetles</b> in a no-choice food source experiment indicated that considerable reproduction can occur on blueberry, cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. Third, sampling summer-bearing raspberry, peach, blueberry, and cherry in 2004 and 2005 confirmed that beetles were present, often in high densities (0. 1 - 108. 5 strawberry sap beetles/m 2), in commercial fields with fruit or vegetable material on the ground. In summary, the beetles are able to feed, complete development, and overwinter in habitats other than strawberry.

This study aimed to determine the relationship between strawberry fruit maturation stages and the feeding of <b>sap</b> <b>beetle</b> in laboratory and to evaluate food attractants and population dynamics of this species during the crop season. To evaluate the feeding preference of strawberry fruits 'Camarosa' at different maturation stages &# 91;green (G), semi-ripe (SM) and ripe (R) &# 93; were exposed to adult <b>sap</b> <b>beetles</b> in plastic cups. We evaluated in field the effect of food baits and pest fluctuation with traps baited with different food baits: (T 1) ripe ground strawberries; (T 2) cattle feed, granulated sugar and water; (T 3) T 1 and T 2 attractants mixed at 1 : 1 ratio; (T 4) fruit mix, granulated sugar, water and beer, sprayed with isoamyl-acetate and (T 5) control (no food attractants and insecticide). In all treatments the insecticide Malathion 1000 ® CE was mixed. The population dynamics of adult beetles were monitored during throughout the cycle of strawberry culture in the municipalities of Caxias do Sul and Bom Princípio, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, using the best food baits for catching adults of the pest. There was no significant difference in relation to the feeding of <b>sap</b> <b>beetle</b> adults in any of the maturation stages, 96 hours after infestation, with no significant increase in feeding on ripe strawberries. In the field, traps baited with ripe strawberries were effective in attracting insects for seven days, with the first occurrence of the pest in June in the municipality of Caxias do Sul and in August in Bom Princípio, with population peaks during January in both experiments...|$|R

40|$|Magnolia sprengeri Pamp. is an ornamentally and ecologically {{important}} {{tree that}} blooms at cold temperatures in early spring. In this study, thermogenesis and {{variation in the}} chemical compounds of floral odours and insect visitation in relation to flowering cycles were studied to increase {{our understanding of the}} role of floral thermogenesis in the pollination biology of M. sprengeri. There were five distinct floral stages across the floral cycle of this species: pre-pistillate, pistillate, pre-staminate, staminate and post-staminate. Floral thermogenesis during anthesis and consisted of two distinct peaks: one at the pistillate stage and the other at the staminate stage. Insects of five families visited M. sprengeri during the floral cycle, and <b>sap</b> <b>beetles</b> (Epuraea sp., Nitidulidae) were determined to be the most effective pollinators, whereas bees (Apis cerana, Apidae) were considered to be occasional pollinators. A strong fragrance was released during thermogenesis, consisting of 18 chemical compounds. Although the relative proportions of these compounds varied at different floral stages across anthesis, linalool, 1 -iodo- 2 -methylundecane and 2, 2, 6 -trimethyl- 6 -vinyltetrahydro- 2 H-pyran- 3 -ol were dominant. Importantly, we found that the floral blends released during the pistillate and staminate stages were very similar, and coincided with flower visitation by <b>sap</b> <b>beetles</b> and the two thermogenic episodes. Based on these results, we propose that odour acts as a signal for a reward (pollen) and that an odour mimicry of staminate-stage flowers occurs during the pistillate stage...|$|R
