5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, {{the right of}} way had to be cleared with <b>chainsaws,</b> bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if it had to be moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|About fifty {{people were}} on the top wooden balcony {{at the time of}} the collapse. According to one witness, the sound of {{splintering}} wood was heard immediately before the collapse, which occurred shortly after midnight local time. The collapse started on the third floor, pulling down other balconies below. The first, second, and third floor balconies all collapsed into the basement below, carrying a total of approximately one hundred people among them. Several people were also trapped in a basement stairwell. Survivors helped to pull victims out from under the debris of the balconies, and rescue workers had to use <b>chainsaws</b> to free others. One of the survivors was a nurse, and had started a rescue effort before the emergency services arrived. The Chicago Fire Department supplied the main rescue effort. Eleven people were killed in the collapse, with two more subsequently dying while hospitalized; fifty-seven people were injured.|$|E
5|$|Four Canadian Navy ships {{headed to}} the Gulf Coast of the United States, {{carrying}} relief supplies {{to help in the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, were slowed down trying to avoid Hurricanes Nate and Ophelia. The convoy included a destroyer, two frigates, and an icebreaker, and developed a plan to travel between the two hurricanes to minimize damage to their cargo. Crews, anticipating potentially rough seas and gusty winds even with the averted course, secured onboard supplies such as generators, <b>chainsaws,</b> diapers, and cots. The genesis of Tropical Storm Nate continued the unprecedented levels of tropical activity during the 2005 hurricane season; when it developed on September5, it was the earliest in any season that the fourteenth named tropical cyclone formed, surpassing the previous record held by an unnamed storm during the 1936 season.|$|E

5|$|Senior officer Mark (Robin Clarke) radios Sandy – his romantic {{interest}} – {{from the}} Operations Room to stall for time as Kate and operations chief Gary (Steven Grives) depart to requisition <b>chainsaws</b> from a storage room. The ruse is uncovered and Sandy harpoons Gary outside the airlock, breathing the atmosphere to no ill effect as she mauls his flesh. Preparing {{for a final}} confrontation, Mark stumbles across Sandy's newborn, mutant twins. He entrusts them to Sharon as the mother blasts through the Operations Room door and destroys all the equipment inside, although {{it is evident that}} she no longer possesses unnatural strength. Crippled by an explosive charge, Kate is gored to death. In a last stand, Mark strangles and kills Sandy with a ripped-out cable. He returns to Sharon to discover one of the twins biting at her slit neck, before its sibling launches itself at him.|$|E
5|$|Several {{flights in}} and out of the state were delayed or {{canceled}}, and the Cape May-Lewes Ferry canceled travel across the Delaware Bay during the duration of Isabel. In Atlantic City, casino workers prepared for coastal flooding by placing sandbags at boardwalk entrances. New Jersey Transit workers secured its buses, railways, and light rail equipment. To ensure service would remain accessible during and after the hurricane, NJ Transit prepared backup generators, pumps, and <b>chainsaws,</b> with workers inspecting trains and the paths of the lines. FEMA mobilized and dispatched an Urban Search and Rescue Task Force of 28people to the state for possible rescue duty. Days before the storm made landfall, the Salvation Army prepared food and aid for potentially affected citizens. In anticipation for the effects of Isabel, Governor Jim McGreevey declared a state of emergency, which allowed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deal with the situation.|$|E
5|$|The Voćin {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 43 civilians in Voćin, Croatia, by the Serbian White Eagles paramilitary unit on 13 December 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The massacre was carried out after the unit was ordered to abandon the village before the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) recaptured the area in Operation Papuk-91. All the victims were local Croats, save one Serb, {{who had tried to}} protect his neighbours. Gunfire was the leading cause of death, though some of the victims were killed with axes or <b>chainsaws,</b> or were burned to death. The victims exhibited signs of torture and were left unburied. On the night of 13–14 December, the White Eagles dynamited a 550-year-old church in the village.|$|E
5000|$|Two guilds {{have formed}} for <b>chainsaw</b> artists. The Cascade <b>Chainsaw</b> Sculptors Guild (CCSG) {{is a nonprofit}} {{organization}} that was founded by a group of <b>chainsaw</b> artists in 1986. In 1993, the CCSG started putting out a bimonthly newsletter, [...] "The Cutting Edge". Another nonprofit guild, United <b>Chainsaw</b> Carvers Guild, was established in 2002 and published a quarterly newsletter titled [...] "The <b>Chainsaw</b> Letter", but has since stopped publishing its newsletter. Both guilds claim to promote <b>chainsaw</b> art and the sharing of ideas amongst fellow artisans.|$|R

5000|$|Each October, usually {{close to}} Halloween, Bill Allred portrays the {{character}} of [...] "Chainsaw Guy", {{the guy with the}} <b>chainsaw</b> and hockey mask {{at the end of a}} typical spook alley. Kerry introduces <b>Chainsaw</b> Guy and illuminates the audience as to <b>Chainsaw</b> Guy's credentials as a couple's counselor and sex therapist. Listeners are then invited to call in and ask <b>Chainsaw</b> Guy for advice. <b>Chainsaw</b> guy, who never removes his mask, and consistently carries his <b>chainsaw</b> with him, then proceeds to give advice to the listener. The advice can be somewhat hard to understand due to the mask and the gas-powered tree-trimming implement. When <b>Chainsaw</b> Guy began his career, all he could afford was an Eager Beaver. This saw was replaced by a larger and more powerful Husqvarna, which has since been upgraded to a Pullen. This is one of Gina's favorite segments of the year. <b>Chainsaw</b> Guy's brother Leaf Blower Guy has made an appearance when <b>Chainsaw</b> Guy has been busy.|$|R
5|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{assisted}} in coordinating preparations for Emily. The United States Department of Defense sent power equipment, previously {{used during the}} Great Flood of 1993, to Fort Bragg, while the United States Department of Agriculture stockpiled food in risk zones. Power companies deliberately shut off the power in the Outer Banks to reduce damage to the system and mitigate the risk of electrocutions. At Naval Station Norfolk, 28ships sailed out to sea to ride out the storm; aircraft were evacuated, and nonessential personnel were sent home. The North Carolina government announced ahead of the storm {{that it would not}} create a State Disaster Fund, instead relying on private relief organizations such as the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. The state's park service pre-positioned 60members with <b>chainsaws</b> to help clear downed trees. Because Emily hit during the busy Labor Day weekend, the tourism industry suffered about $10million in business losses. Many of the evacuees relocated to southeastern Virginia, which saw greatly increased business during the weekend.|$|E

25|$|The {{relatively}} flimsy mesh visor, with imperfect {{coverage of}} the face, is considered acceptable because the chips produced by well-maintained <b>chainsaws</b> are of relatively uniform size and speed. Unlike other woodworking tools, a chainsaw with a sharp chain produces little or no sawdust, only chips (that are too large to fit through the visor's mesh).|$|E
