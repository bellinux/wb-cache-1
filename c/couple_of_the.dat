The Philippines exhibits aspects found in other Asian countries with a Malay heritage, yet its culture also displays a significant number of Spanish and American influences. Traditional festivities known as barrio fiestas (district festivals) to commemorate the feast days of patron saints are common, these community celebrations are times for feasting, music, and dancing. The Ati-Atihan, Moriones and Sinulog festivals are a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most well-known.|$|E

On a later visit to the island of Murano, he visited more than fifty glass factories. He was fascinated by the little demonstration furnaces that some of the factories placed outside their walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E
40|$|Gender's {{knowledge}} about marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex (special for homosexual couple) in Indonesia Marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same {{sex is not}} legal by law in Indonesia {{but there are many}} <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex who get married in other countries which <b>the</b> marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex is legal or just live together without marriage. In this writing there are two problems that appear. Firstly, how marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex (special for homosexual couple) viewed by gender's perspective and connected to Indonesian Marriage act. Secondly, how <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex in Indonesia connected to Indonesian Marriage acts. This law research using normative law research. Data source using secondary data consist of primary law substance and secondary law substance. Vertically law systematization using derogation principle with basis of law conduct is lex superior derogate legi inferiori. Horizontally law systematization using noncontradiction principle with basis of law conduct is lex specialist derogate legi generalist. This writing using deductive principle to get the conclusion. Marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex, by homosexual couple or lesbian couple can be correct if it is looking at from gender because position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man as a husband changes to be a wife and the other way position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> woman as a wife changes to be a husband. In Indonesia, marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex is not legal by law. Because the Indonesian marriage acts only legalize marriage by {{a man and a woman}} (marriage by the different sex). So if the couples by same sex want to get married, they must go to the other countries which <b>the</b> marriage by <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex is legal, like Netherland, Canada, or Spanish. In Jakarta, there is one foundation named Arus Pelangi who gives facilities for <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex to make an agreement if they want to live together but they are not married. This Agreement is made for <b>couples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sex when they want to live together and mixed their property. So if they separated, there is not property struggle between them. This foundation also give law protect for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transsexual in Indonesia. ...|$|R

5|$|To {{describe}} {{the details of}} the attack and its background, Dumont de Montigny and Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz, the leading 18th-century historians of Louisiana, drew on information collected from French women taken captive during the massacre. They explained that the Natchez had conspired with other nations but had attacked a few days earlier than the date agreed upon and that they had used a system of bundles of sticks held by each of the conspiring tribes in order to count down the number of days remaining until the strike. The undetected destruction of a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sticks in the Natchez Grand Village derailed the count, although the reason for the lost sticks differed in each historian's account. The other nations called off their participation in the plot because of the Natchez' premature attack, and therefore the very existence of the conspiracy remained conjectural.|$|E

5|$|During a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Svea flights, Andrée {{tested and}} tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique {{which he had}} developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel {{at the same speed}} as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E
5|$|The Grade I listed Christchurch Castle is of Norman {{origin and}} was {{originally}} of a motte and bailey construction. The castle once dominated the town but now lies in ruins {{and only a}} <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keep walls remain. A castle has stood in Christchurch since approximately 924 AD when Edward the Elder fortified the town with a wooden fort on a motte. After the Norman conquest in 1066 the castle's defences were strengthened with a ditch and bailey surrounded by a wooden palisade. The wooden fort was replaced; at first with another wooden structure and then a stone keep which was constructed in the 12th century. Within the curtain wall of the castle stands the Constable's House, a Grade I listed Norman dwelling. Much of the building's stonework remains, including a rare example of a Norman chimney (one of only five in the country) and the privy which extends out across the mill stream. The castle was slighted by the Parliamentary army during the English Civil War to prevent the stronghold from falling into Royalist hands.|$|E

The stele is important because it sets forth the king's ancestry and is of great help in reconstructing the sequence of Champa's rulers.
