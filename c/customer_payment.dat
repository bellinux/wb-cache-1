50|$|The {{effects of}} capital {{controls}} changed <b>customer</b> <b>payment</b> habits. Since the controls on withdrawals {{did not apply}} to the use of credit/debit cards to make purchases in Greek retail outlets, the average use of credit card transactions jumped from 4.5% to 19.5% in a relatively short time and up to 35% in supermarket transactions with more than 50% of people saying according to the Bank of Greece that they used their cards more than in the past, all of which left a paper trail that the Greek government was keen to encourage in its combat against tax evasion, {{despite the fact that the}} general use of credit transactions is believed to drive up the overhead for businesses and ultimately increase the price of goods and services for consumers. Before capital controls, in 2014, on average every Greek citizen used cards for transactions, not including ATMs, on average 8 times per year (€428 per year) against a 93-time European Union average (€3947 per year), while in 2015 the numbers rose to 20 times per year per citizen (€818 per year) and representing €9 billion, double that of the previous year.|$|E

40|$|House {{numbering}} is {{the system}} of giving a unique number to each building in a street or area, {{with the intention of}} making it easier to locate a particular building. The house number is often part of a postal address. The term describes the number of any building (residential or not) or vacant lot with a mailbox. House numbering schemes vary by place, and in many cases even within cities. In some areas, especially in rural area of Indonesia, the house or building are not numbered yet. This is caused by the demography and the geography. This study was done on cable TV industries in Sorong Papua, Indonesia. Where the main problem in this research is how {{to reduce the number of}} <b>customer</b> <b>payment</b> arrears and minimize duration of customer dues. There are several aspects of why customers in arrears, on the one hand because of the difficulty of the collector to find the location of the customer and on the other hand due to poor customer habits, so that they do not want to pay. The research model was constructed with a Geographical Information System to determine the mapping customers. The mapping process is done with the customer to establish a classification of association rule between customers. The results of this study could assist companies in finding the location of customers quickly and make the mapping according to <b>customer</b> <b>payment</b> behavior. The approach of the results obtained can be further used to determine the best strategy in dealing with customers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Because many {{current payment}} systems are poorly implemented, or of incompetence, private data of {{consumers}} such as payment details, addresses and their purchase history can be compromised. Furthermore, current payment systems {{do not offer}} any non-repudiable verification to a completed transaction, which poses risks to all the parties of the transaction – the consumer, the merchant and the financial institution. One {{solution to this problem}} was SET, but it was never really a success because of its complexity and poor reception from consumers. In this paper, we introduce a third party payment system that aims to preserve privacy by severing the link between their purchase and payment records, while providing a traceable transaction that maintains its integrity and is non-repudiable. Our system also removes much of the responsibilities placed on the merchant with regards to securing sensitive data related to <b>customer</b> <b>payment,</b> thus increasing the potential of small businesses to take part in e-commerce without significant investments in computer security. ...|$|E
40|$|Restaurant guests seem enthusiastically {{ready to}} adopt {{customer}} facing payment technologies, {{at least in}} casual restaurants, according to this study of the views of 1, 297 U. S. consumers. Three sub-samples of consumers rated table-top tablets, smartphones, and traditional check settlement against eight measurement constructs. The constructs were accuracy, control of pacing, convenience, efficiency, experience quality, future spending intentions, privacy, and satisfaction with the payment method. In all eight constructs, paying with technology was rated {{significantly higher than the}} traditional settlement approach. For all but efficiency, the respondents’ ratings were no different for smartphones and table-top tablets, but the tablets were rated as significantly more efficient than smartphones. While these ratings may be different for other restaurant segments (or other countries’ consumers), it appears that restaurant operators {{do not have to be}} concerned about guests’ acceptance of <b>customer</b> <b>payment</b> technologies. In fact, given increasing privacy concerns, some guests may greatly appreciate the control and privacy that they gain by being able to use payment technologies...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{expansions}} {{of mobile}} communication technologies across sub-Saharan Africa have generated considerable optimism regarding {{their impact on}} socioeconomic development outcomes. Key payment applications, such as mobile-enabled payment instruments (i. e. SMS-based mobile money and wireless pay point services) are experiencing substantial adoption in East Africa and Dar es Salaam was the first city in sub-Saharan Africa to integrate these payment instruments into the urban water sector in mid- 2009. Tanzania's largest city is demonstrative of the potential of mobile communication technologies to overcome water provision challenges such as inefficient billing and collection systems and revenue under-collection. This thesis uses Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD) as an organising theoretical perspective to examine relationships {{between the use of}} mobile-enabled payment methods for water bill payments and <b>customer</b> <b>payment</b> behaviours, water utility performance, and access to water services. Data were collected using a survey methodology that tested hypotheses related to financial sustainability, petty corruption, satisfaction and service quality in payment practices, and neighbourhood resale in the informal water sector. Data sources include a survey administered to a stratified random sample of 1097 water utility customers; 42 semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders within the water sector and telecommunications industry; and a unique water payments database with information on approximately 1, 000, 000 water-related transactions made by over 106, 000 customers. Qualitative and quantitative analyses provide evidence that the use of mobile-enabled payment methods can significantly improve <b>customer</b> <b>payment</b> behaviours (i. e. frequency of payment, annual revenue collection per customer), reduce opportunities for petty corruption (i. e. theft, bribery, and record-keeping), and support better access to improved water sources by unconnected households through neighbourhood resale practices. Implications for urban water provision in sub-Saharan Africa include higher collection efficiencies, more active customer bases, and wider direct and indirect reliance on utility-provided services. This thesis also contributes to ICTD scholarship by providing evidence that the use of mobile-enabled payment methods represents a disruptive transformation that enables more extensive and active citizen participation in the billing and payment processes of public service provision.

40|$|Abstract — In {{well-developed}} markets, {{those who}} {{benefit from a}} product or service are willing to recompense the supplier for the value which the customer or user receives. Direct <b>customer</b> <b>payment</b> for value {{is not the only}} manner in which businesses are encouraged to continue development and innovation. In print, on the web and in some mobile markets, advertisers pay for the ability to present their message to target audiences. In some markets entrepreneurs and investors are motivated by the promise of a lucrative buy-out. In mobile AR, no one is certain which business models will be best. Indeed, few have been tried. In order for future development of Mobile AR to be well-funded there needs to be greater clarity about the sources of revenues. In this position paper, we describe existing strategies for generating revenue from AR technologies, products and services. We encourage all businesses embarking in mobile AR to begin putting the business structures for monetization into place and to test different models periodically {{in order to ensure that}} the best return on investment can be reached.

40|$|International audienceNowadays, NFC {{technology}} {{is used in}} contactless payment applications by offering the NFC payment functionality in credit/debit cards, smartphones and payment terminals. Thus, an NFC payment transaction is executed in a simple and practical way. EMV is the security protocol for both contact and contactless payment systems. However, during an EMV payment transaction, this standard does not ensure two main security constraints between a <b>customer</b> <b>payment</b> device and a payment terminal: (1) mutual authentication, (2) confidentiality of sensitive banking data exchanged. These weaknesses represent a major risk {{in the case of}} NFC payment because the transaction is performed using NFC radio waves in an open environment. The risk is reduced in the case of contact payment because the transaction is executed in a closed environment by inserting the card into the terminal. In this paper, we propose a new security protocol for NFC payment transactions based on a Cloud infrastructure. We verify the correctness of this proposal using Scyther tool that provides formal proofs for security protocols...|$|E
