25|$|Scientist Zbigniew Paptrotny {{has argued}} that the {{formulation}} of post-detection protocols can be guided by three factors: terrestrial society's readiness to accept the news of ET detection, how the news of detection is released, and the <b>comprehensibility</b> of the message in the signal. These three broad areas and their related subsidiaries comprise the bulk of the content and discourse surrounding PDPs.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{language of}} the Inuit is a system of closely interrelated dialects that are not readily comprehensible {{from one end of}} the Inuit world to the other, and some people do not think of it as a single language but rather as a group of languages. However, there are no clear criteria for breaking the Inuit language into specific member languages since it forms a dialect continuum. Each band of Inuit understands its neighbours, and most likely its neighbours' neighbours; but at some remove, <b>comprehensibility</b> drops to a very low level.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of the first detection, policy- or {{decision-makers}} might have the opportunity to make a conscious decision about composing and sending a message. The ambiguity and content of signals sent both to and from Earth would have profound implications for what actions needed to be taken. A PDP that did not take signal <b>comprehensibility</b> into account would not be flexible enough to inform appropriate action. The area of SETI research known as CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence), is concerned with how humankind should carry out this communication and, to some extent, representation problems such as whether a response should be with one collective voice or if anyone with access to a transmitter should have the right to communicate.|$|E
500|$|Having Fun with Elvis on Stage {{has been}} {{described}} as the worst album of Elvis Presley's career. Critics felt that the album's material was spliced in a manner lacking any continuity and nearly devoid of <b>comprehensibility,</b> let alone humor. Mark Deming of AllMusic states that [...] "some have called Having Fun with Elvis on Stage thoroughly unlistenable, but actually it's worse than that; hearing it is like witnessing an auto wreck that somehow plowed into a carnival freak show, leaving onlookers at once too horrified and too baffled to turn away." [...] Nick Greene, a writer for Mental Floss, felt that the material presented on the record is [...] "so incoherent, you don't really get an idea of his stage presence, despite the fact that all the audio comes from his shows." [...] Rock critics Jimmy Guterman and Owen O'Donnell, writing in their 1991 book The Worst Rock and Roll Records of All Time, named it the worst rock album ever, although one could easily note the lack of [...] "rock and roll" [...] in the record.|$|E

Their long-term objective was that this language would replace the individual Slavic languages.

2500|$|Some modern, language-specific IDEs (in {{contrast}} to text editors) perform full language parsing {{which results in}} very accurate understanding of code. An extension of syntax highlighting was called [...] "semantic highlighting" [...] in 2009 by David Nolden [...] for the open-source C++ IDE KDevelop. For example, semantic highlighting may give local variables unique distinct colors to improve the <b>comprehensibility</b> of code. In 2014 the idea of colored local variables was [...] further popularized due to a blog post by Evan Brooks, and after that, the idea was transferred to other popular IDEs like Visual Studio, Xcode, and others.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Taking Fidelity Philosophically" [...] (in Difference in Translation), Johnson {{describes}} translation as an ultimately impossible endeavor {{because the}} [...] "mother" [...] or original language is already, intrinsically untranslatable from signifier to signified. The more one attempts to translate a work into <b>comprehensibility,</b> {{the more likely}} one is to stray from its original ambiguity. [...] Jacques Derrida, with his thoughts on différance, elucidates the complicating but necessary fact of language: that it is foreign to itself. Every attempt to translate sets the language against itself, creating new tensions as it progresses. Translation, though impossible, is also necessary, as it is precisely these tensions that constitute language.|$|E
2500|$|The {{issue of}} World Englishes was first raised in 1978 to examine {{concepts}} of regional Englishes globally. Pragmatic {{factors such as}} appropriateness, <b>comprehensibility</b> and interpretability justified the use of English as an international and intra-national language. In 1988, at a Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) conference in Honolulu, Hawaii, the International Committee of the Study of World Englishes (ICWE) was formed. In 1992, the ICWE formally launched the International Association for World Englishes (IAWE) at a conference of [...] "World Englishes Today", at the University of Illinois, USA. There is now an academic journal devoted {{to the study of}} this topic, titled World Englishes.|$|E
2500|$|His motets are {{the most}} {{progressive}} part of his output, and are characteristic of the mid-century practice intermediate between the smooth, pervading imitation of composers such as Nicolas Gombert, where all voices where equal, and textural contrast was minimized; and late-century composers such as Lassus. [...] Indeed, many of his motets are reminiscent of Lassus, using chromaticism, cross-relations, textural contrast, and always remaining carefully attentive to the <b>comprehensibility</b> of the text. [...] Waelrant uses text-painting as well, highlighting individual words with characteristic gestures, as a method to increase the expressivity of the music. [...] Occasionally, his use of text-painting is obvious: [...] for example, in his chanson Musiciens qui chantez, after the word [...] "taire" [...] (silent) all the voices rest {{for a moment of}} silence.|$|E

[625:1] This {{passing off}} of his real irresolution and fancy-dalliance for depth of Reserve and for Plan formed within the magic circle of his own inapproachable spirits is very fine; but still it is not tragic--nay scarce obvious enough to be {{altogether}} dramatic, if in this word we involve theatre-representation. Iago (so far only analogous to Wallenstein as in him an Impulse {{is the source of}} his conduct rather than the motive), always acting is not the object of Interest, [but] derives a constant interest from Othello, on whom he is acting; from Desdemona, Cassio, every one; and, besides, for the purpose of theatric <b>comprehensibility</b> he is furnished with a set of outside motives that actually pass with the groundling for the true springs of action.

6000|$|For {{this reason}} non-rigid reference-bodies are used, which {{are as a}} whole not only moving in any way whatsoever, but which also suffer {{alterations}} in form ad lib. during their motion. Clocks, for which the law of motion is of any kind, however irregular, serve for the definition of time. We have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a point on the non-rigid reference-body. These clocks satisfy only the one condition, that the [...] "readings" [...] which are observed simultaneously on adjacent clocks (in space) differ from each other by an indefinitely small amount. This non-rigid reference-body, which might appropriately be termed a [...] "reference-mollusc", is in the main equivalent to a Gaussian four-dimensional co-ordinate system chosen arbitrarily. That which gives the [...] "mollusc" [...] a certain <b>comprehensibility</b> {{as compared with the}} Gauss co-ordinate system is the (really unjustified) formal retention of the separate existence of the space co-ordinates as opposed to the time co-ordinate. Every point on the mollusc is treated as a space-point, and every material point which is at rest relatively to it as at rest, so long as the mollusc is considered as reference-body. The general principle of relativity requires that all these molluscs can be used as reference-bodies with equal right and equal success in the formulation of the general laws of nature; the laws themselves must be quite independent of the choice of mollusc.|$|E
