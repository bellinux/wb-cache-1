500|$|The first single, [...] "Heroin", was {{accompanied}} {{with the most}} music videos, {{with a total of}} five for several different remixed versions of the cover. Each was a [...] "Blendo" [...] video which rapidly shifted random imagery and colours in time with the music. Four of the music videos for the song were directed by Brett Leonard, with a fifth being credited to Howard Deutch. Each used stock footage shot by Idol and Leonard, filmed personally and edited on Idol's computer. Idol did so with the intention of sending a [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] message that mocked and rejected the standards of MTV music video creation. [...] "We did it all on camcorder and we sort of wanted to say you <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> videos, and you don't always {{have to do it in}} a very MTV way." [...] None were released for rotation on television; instead, one was included in the video album release, Cyberpunk: Shock to the System.|$|E
500|$|A black marketeer {{who makes}} a living dealing Kaiju organs. Perlman stated, [...] "I {{actually}} think this character {{was designed to be}} played by another ethnicity other than myself. And somewhere along the way, [...] had the notion, 'Wouldn't it be interesting to turn this guy into more of an invention.' So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the character… I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up persona… which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guy—that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole story… That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, you <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent. You do a little weightlifting with the audience." [...] The bird tattoos on Chau's fingers indicate his past as a gangster. In the film, Chau states he took the name from his favorite historical figure and his second-favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn. Del Toro drew inspiration from Burt Lancaster's performance in Elmer Gantry when writing the character.|$|E

He first {{addresses}} the {{nuclear arms race}} being waged between the United States and the Soviet Union, and laments the introduction of intergalactic weapons. He then {{addresses the}} devastation of the world's rain forests for commercial gain and the threat to wildlife. He refers to the Save the Whales environmental campaign and how Greenpeace's attempts to limit whale hunting had been thwarted by the interests of [...] "dog food salesmen". He also laments the irresponsibility of arms manufacturers and, with regard to plutonium stockpiles, concludes: [...] "Now you <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> H-bomb / Right {{in the kitchen with}} your mom." [...] He then denigrates the use of nuclear power as a [...] "half-wit's answer to a need" [...] that causes cancer. In the final verse, Harrison attributes the world's environmental problems to just a few, profit-seeking individuals. He ends on what he promises to be [...] "a happy note" [...] by stating that a simple solution lies in the realisation that [...] "God [...] in your heart".|$|E

But, as it is not limited to any one heir by name, and not revoked anywhere, it now holds as good with young Armadale as it would have held under other circumstances with Mr. Blanchard's son.

Cuthbert, for all his faithfulness, could not hold up the financial end of the establishment unsupported for at least another eighteen months; and this disaster meant that the wedding would have to be postponed again.

Now we have got rolling-mills, and we use the rails to make tie-bars for the D. and O. {{sleepers}} and all sorts of things. We turn out five hundred D. and O. sleepers a day. Altogether, we use about seventy-five tons of our own iron a month here. Iron in Calcutta costs about five-eight a hundredweight; ours costs between three-four and three-eight, and on that item alone we save three thousand a month. Don't ask me how many miles of rails we own. There are fifteen hundred miles of line, and you <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> calculation. All those things like babies' graves, down in that shed, are the moulds for the D. and O. sleepers. We test them by dropping three hundredweight and three hundred quarters of iron on top of them from a height of seven feet, or eleven sometimes. They don't often smash. We have a notion here that our iron is as good as the Home stuff." ...|$|E
