40|$|Human {{ability to}} resolve {{temporal}} variation, or flicker, in the luminance (brightness) or chromaticity (color) {{of an image}} declines with increasing frequency and is limited, within the central visual field, to a <b>critical</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>frequency</b> of ≈ 50 and 25 Hz, respectively. Much remains unknown about the neural filtering that underlies this frequency-dependent attenuation of flicker sensitivity, most notably the number of filtering stages involved and their neural loci. Here we use the process of flicker adaptation, by which an observer's flicker sensitivity is attenuated after prolonged exposure to flickering lights, as a functional landmark. We show that flicker adaptation is more sensitive to high temporal frequencies than is conscious perception and that prolonged exposure to invisible flicker of either luminance or chromaticity, at frequencies above the respective <b>critical</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>frequency,</b> can compromise our visual sensitivity.

The tests included the porto-systemic encephalopathy (PSE-) test, <b>critical</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>frequency,</b> MELD score and ammonia concentration.

40|$|Flicker {{response}} curves {{have been}} obtained at 21. 5 °C. for three genera of fresh water teleosts: Enneacanthus (sunfish), Xiphophorus (swordtail), Platypoecilius (Platy), by the determination of mean critical intensities for response at fixed <b>flicker</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and for a certain homogeneous group of backcross hybrids of swordtail x Platy (Black Helleri). The curves exhibit marked differences in form and proportions. The same type of analysis is applicable to each, however. A low intensity rod-governed section has added to it a more extensive cone portion. Each part is accurately described by the equation F = Fmax. /(1 + e-p log-p logI/Ii), where F = <b>flicker</b> <b>frequency,</b> I = associated mean critical intensity, and Ii is the intensity at the inflection point of the sigmoid curve relating F to log I. There is no correlation between quantitative features of the rod and cone portions. Threshold intensities, p, Ii, and Fmax. are separately and independently determined. The hybrid Black Helleri show quantitative agreement with the Xiphophorus parental stock in the values of p for rods and cones, and in the cone Fmax.; the rod Fmax. {{is very similar to}} that for the Platy stock; the general level of effective intensities is rather like that of the Platy form. This provides, among other things, a new kind of support for the duplicity doctrine. Various races of Platypoecilius maculatus, and P. variatus, give closely agreeing values of Im at different flicker frequencies; and two species of sunfish also agree. The effect of cross-breeding is thus not a superficial thing. It indicates the possibility of further genetic investigation. The variability of the critical intensity for response to flicker follows the rules previously found to hold for other forms. The variation is the expression of a property of the tested organism. It is shown that, on the assumption of a frequency distribution of receptor element thresholds as a function of log I, with fluctuation in the excitabilities of the marginally excited elements, it is to be expected that the dispersion of <b>critical</b> <b>flicker</b> <b>frequencies</b> in repeated measurements will pass through a maximum as log I is increased, whereas the dispersion of critical intensities will be proportional to Im; and that the proportionality factor in the case of different organisms bears no relation to the form or position of the respective curves relating mean <b>critical</b> intensity to <b>flicker</b> <b>frequency.</b> These deductions agree with the experimental findings...|$|R

40|$|<b>Critical</b> <b>flicker</b> fusion <b>frequencies</b> were {{measured}} and Berg's hexobarbitone test was applied in six normal young adult male volunteers, following 2 hours passive hyper-ventilation and again after 2 hours rest. Measured {{by reduction of}} the <b>critical</b> <b>flicker</b> fusion <b>frequency,</b> {{there was no significant}} difference in the response to hexobarbitone in the hyperventilated and control situations. At the present time there is a controversy as to whether hyperventilation, as applied in modern anaesthetic practice, is harmful to the central nervous system. The subject has been reviewed by several authors, e. g. Robinson and Gray (1961) and Allen and Morris (1962). Some investigators believe that the neurological effects of hyperventilation are due directly to changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PacO 3) and hydrogen ion concentration and that the changes are completely reversible. Others consider that the neurological effects are the result of cerebral ischaemia due to the reduction in cerebral blood flow which occurs when the Paco, is lowered (Kety and Schmidt, 1946), and therefore hyper-ventilation is a potential cause of permanent damage to the brain. Berg (1949) developed a technique based on <b>critical</b> <b>flicker</b> fusion (c. f. f.) which, when com-bined with the administration of a small amount of hexobarbitone, made it possible for him to detect latent brain damage.

The curve for Fm lies above the curve of Im by an amount which, as a function of I, can be predicted from a knowledge either of the variation of Im or of Fm. The law of the observable connection between F and I is properly expressed as a band, not as a simple curve. The variation of Im (and of Fm) is not due to "experimental error," but is an expression of the variable character of the organism's capacity to exhibit the reaction which is the basis of the measurements. As in other series of measurements, P. E. I is a rectilinear function of Im; P. E. F passes through a maximum as F (or I) increases. The form of P. E.
