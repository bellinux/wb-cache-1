40|$|This paper investigates whether {{macroeconomic}} {{and data}} transparency standards lead to lower borrowing costs in sovereign bond markets. We essentially show that emerging market countries which subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) experienced a significant decline in borrowing cost proxied by sovereign yield spreads on secondary markets. However, the adherence of these markets to the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Practices</b> on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies caused {{a significant increase}} in the yield spreads. There is no impact of the adherence to the <b>Code</b> <b>of</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Practices</b> in Fiscal Transparency on the changes of sovereign spreads. In addition, the results suggest that a debtor country’s internal liquidity factor (measured by the total reserves to total external debt service ratio) and external liquidity conditions (measured by the yield on US longterm bond) are the most important determinants of emerging market spreads.
