40|$|Circular {{feature is}} one of the most common part {{features}} used in machines. Since it is practically impossible to make a part with perfect geometry, tolerances are specified to ensure the functionality of a final product while maintaining a low cost. This study presents fundamental treatments for circularity tolerance modeling, analysis, and design. First, a roundness profile model is presented. At present, the standard for geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, ASME Y 14. 5 M, specifies a circularity tolerance based on the tolerance zones defined by two concentric circular boundaries. To represent profile variation within the tolerance zones, a harmonic roundness model using Fourier series expansions is proposed. A cutting profile simulation model has also been developed to illustrate the relationship between the radial error motion of a machine tool spindle and the resultant part profiles. The profile model has been verified statistically by a large number of real profiles produced by turning and cylindrical grinding. Second, the effect of out-of-roundness on positioning accuracy is investigated for various <b>cylindrical</b> <b>fit</b> conditions. Analytical approaches and computer simulations are used together to facilitate more extensive investigations. Systematic procedures are also proposed for assigning circularity tolerance by prescribing a fit condition and a desirable process capability of assembly. As a result, new circularity tolerance guidelines are suggested for fit conditions. Third, the study is further extended to spindle design analysis. The geometrical accuracy of a machine tool spindle has been investigated to examine the effect of circularity and concentricity tolerance on spindle running accuracy. The study is verified through real spindle design data obtained from a custom-built Purdue High Speed Spindle. Finally, an experimental study is provided to verify the simulation routines used in the analysis of positioning accuracy. ...|$|E

The results showed that use of the modified cylinder method resulted in different release profiles associated with unique release mechanisms for the nanocarrier systems investigated. The modified cylinder method also permitted discrimination between forced and normal in vitro release of the model drugs from gelatin NPs in the presence or absence of enzymatic degradation.

40|$|International audienceToday, {{manufacturing}} products must meet {{more and more}} severe specifications. The different parts composing the product often necessitate high dimensional precision, which increases the difficulties for a large series production. Then it it necessary to optimize dimensioning of the different components in an economic context. In the case of small dimensional fits, there is an influence of the micro-geometry (form of defect, roughness) and time of the process on the geometrical characteristics of the assembly. At the time of conception, {{it is necessary to}} obtain a good specification that relates the product functionalities with the best cost. The objective study of this is to simulate a shrinkage fit process and provide the fit characteristics according to the microgeometrical defects. Only the form of the defects are taken into account. In the first part, a method a solution of a three dimensional contact involving two cylindrical bodies is presented. The contact is closely conformed (non-Hertzian). The stress field and the strain field, in both bodies, are calculated with the hypothesis that the interface pressure is a sum of different concentrated loads superposing and depending locally on the defects after rendering the contact area discrete. The different basis loads are formulated by Fourier series and modified Bessel functions. Several cases are simualated for different types of defects that can show the influence of the microgeometry on the <b>cylindrical</b> characteristics <b>fit.</b> Finally, an experiment is presented which shows a good correspondence with theory and predicts the extract strength. ...|$|R
