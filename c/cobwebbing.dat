[...] After Haller made sketches and floor plans for the sets, he searched the backlots and property lofts of the major studios in search of available set units that could be inexpensively rented and then put together to form the sets he had conceived. At Universal Studios, he located numerous discarded pieces from old productions, including massive archways, fireplaces, windows and doorways, and several torture machine props. [...] At other studios, he found gigantic stairways and stone wall units. Haller selected and rented numerous pieces from these various depositories and had them delivered to California Studios, where the sets for the film were constructed, following his floor plans as closely as possible. [...] To further set the atmosphere, about 20 gallons of <b>cobwebbing</b> was sprayed throughout the castle's sets.|$|E

40|$|Various {{features}} of the mass yields in heavy ion collisions are studied. The mass yields are {{discussed in terms of}} iterative one dimensional discrete maps. These maps are shown to produce orbits for a monomer or for a nucleus which generate the mass yields and the distribution of cluster sizes. Simple Malthusian dynamics and nonlinear Verhulst dynamics are used to illustrate the approach. Nuclear <b>cobwebbing,</b> attractors of the dynamics, and Lyapanov exponents are discussed for the mass distribution. The self-similar property of the Malthusian orbit offers a new variable for the study of scale invariance using power moments of the mass distribution. Correlation lengths, exponents and dimensions associated with scaling relations are developed. Fourier transforms of the mass distribution are used to obtain power spectra which are investigated for a 1 /f β behavior...|$|E
30|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{synaptic}} plasticity on the determination of firing period and relative phases in a network of two oscillatory neurons coupled with reciprocal inhibition. We combine the phase response curves of the neurons with the short-term synaptic plasticity properties of the synapses to define Poincaré maps for the activity of an oscillatory network. Fixed points of these maps correspond to the phase-locked modes of the network. These maps allow us to analyze the dependence of the resulting network activity on the properties of network components. Using a combination of analysis and simulations, we show how various parameters of the model affect the existence and stability of phase-locked solutions. We find conditions on the synaptic plasticity profiles and the phase response curves of the neurons for the network to be able to maintain a constant firing period, while varying the phase of locking between the neurons or vice versa. A generalization to <b>cobwebbing</b> for two-dimensional maps is also discussed.|$|E
40|$|This type {{of machine}} has a testing device for {{performing}} a quality {{control on the}} knitwear, said device having swivelling extendable arms on which the knitwear is stretched, whereby a gusset stretcher is provided between the extendable arms. The knitwear has only a short dwell time on the stretch-out device. The knitwear is checked for defects in a fully automatic and reliable process by a machine of simple design. The gusset stretcher of the machine contains an illumination source and a camera in the range outside the gusset stretcher, {{the lens of the}} camera being trained on the illuminated parts of the gusset stretcher, whereby the camera is connected to an image processing device. The knitwear is checked for defects by the machine. Very short machine cycles can be maintained, whereby a constant quality can be achieved during checking. The machine and the process performed by it permits the reliable detection of ladders, <b>cobwebbing,</b> holes and similar. The test method is based on the consideration that a hole in the stocking fabric is more transparent when looked through than the fabric itself...|$|E
3000|$|Our results {{complement}} {{those of}} Cui et al. {{in the sense}} that we relate cycle-to-cycle changes in the period independent of how those changes arise, allowing us to also use experimentally obtainable information to derive the maps. Our maps are also based on assumptions that are consistent with Cui et al.’s assumption that the closed-loop behavior of a system can be predicted by knowing the open-looped behavior of some of its components. Our results extend those of Cui et al. and other prior works in that we allow the timing of inputs to vary on a cycle by cycle basis that is determined by the synaptic plasticity profile of the presynaptic neuron. This results in a higher-dimensional map arising by specifically considering the dynamics of synaptic facilitation and depression on a cycle by cycle basis. This yields a 3 D map when plasticity is present only in one direction of the two-cell network, or a 5 D map if present in both directions. When we used the steady-state synaptic plasticity profile, both cases reduce to a 2 D map. For this 2 D map, we derived a geometric method that generalizes <b>cobwebbing</b> in a 1 D map to allow us to study the existence and stability of fixed points. For a generic 1 D map, [...]...|$|E
30|$|The {{main advance}} {{in our work}} is the {{derivation}} of tools for analyzing higher-dimensional maps that incorporate the effects of synaptic plasticity and provide predictions on circumstances under which an oscillatory network of neurons will phase-lock and at what period. In particular, we consider a network of two neurons, mutually coupled by inhibition in which the synaptic strength is frequency dependent. In deriving these maps, we must not only track the phases of each cell, but also the strength of each synapse. As a result, the 1 D map that sufficed in prior studies needs to be replaced with 2 D or 3 D maps. For 2 D maps, we derive a geometric method that generalizes the idea of <b>cobwebbing.</b> Namely, we show how iterations of the map can be tracked through different 2 D surfaces. Moreover, projections of these surfaces onto a common plane yields two curves whose intersection is a fixed point of the map that corresponds to a phase-locked solution. We derive conditions on the PRCs and the parameters that govern synaptic plasticity of the neurons to show how a network can {{have a range of}} parameters over which the network period remains constant, but the phase of locking between cells changes, or vice versa. We also show that the methods derived apply to networks that are heterogeneous either in the intrinsic properties of individual cells, in their synapses, or both.|$|E
