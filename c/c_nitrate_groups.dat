Sixty-four PD patients with hypertension were enrolled in this study. All patients accepted antihypertensive drugs at baseline. Thirty-two patients (<b>nitrate</b> <b>group)</b> took isosorbide mononitrate for 24 weeks. The remaining 32 patients (non-nitrate group) took other antihypertensive drugs.

40|$|Background—The {{basis for}} {{progressive}} attenuation {{of the effects}} of organic nitrates during long-term therapy (nitrate tolerance) remains controversial; proposed mechanisms include impaired nitrate bioconversion resulting in decreased release of nitric oxide (NO) from nitrates and/or increased NO clearance through a reaction with incrementally generated superoxide (O 2 –). Methods and Results—Patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass were randomized to receive 24 hours of intravenously infused nitroglycerin (NTG; <b>nitrate</b> <b>group)</b> or no <b>nitrate</b> therapy (control <b>group).</b> Discarded segments of the internal mammary artery and saphenous vein were used to examine (1) vascular responsiveness to NTG, sodium nitroprusside, and the calcium ionophore A 23187; (2) bioconversion of NTG to 1, 2 - and 1, 3 -glyceryl dinitrate; and (3) the generation of O 2 –. Responses to NTG were reduced 3 - to 5 -fold in vessels from the <b>nitrate</b> <b>group</b> compared with control vessels (P< 0. 01 for both types of segments), whereas responses to sodium nitroprusside and A 23187 were unchanged. Tissue content of 1, 2 -glyceryl dinitrate was lower (P= 0. 012) in the saphenous veins from the <b>nitrate</b> <b>group</b> than in those from the control group. O 2 – generation was greater (P< 0. 01) in internal mammary artery samples from the <b>nitrate</b> <b>group</b> than in those from the control group. However, incremental O 2 – generation induced by an inhibitor of superoxide dismutase did not affect NTG responses. Conclusions—NTG tolerance in patients with coronary artery disease is nitrate-specific and is associated with evidence of impaired NTG bioconversion. Tolerance was associated with incremental O 2 – generation, but short-term elevation of O 2 – did not affect NTG responsiveness, suggesting increased NO clearance by O 2 – has a minimal contribution to tolerance.
