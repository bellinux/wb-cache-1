Results: Serum copper (p < 0. 0001), peroxides (p = 0. 002), a copper fraction unexplained by ceruloplasmin (p < 0. 0001), and CSF h-tau (p = 0. 001) were increased in AD, whereas serum TRAP (p = 0. 03) and CSF beta- amyloid were decreased (p < 0. 0001). Plasma beta- amyloid increased with age in healthy controls (r = 0. 6; p = 0. 05). CSF markers of AD correlated with serum copper variables.

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of conventional power electronics packaging reaches from SMD packages for power chips to large power modules. In {{most of these}} packages the power semiconductors are connected by bond wires, resulting in large resistances and parasitic inductances. Power chip packages have to carry semiconductors with increasing current densities. Conventional wire bonds are limiting their performance. Today's power modules are based on DCB (Direct Copper bonded) ceramic substrates. IGBT switches are mounted onto the ceramic and their top side contacts are connected by thick Al wires. This allows one wiring layer only and makes an integration of driver chips very difficult. Additionally, bond wires result in a high stray inductance which limits the switching frequency. Especially {{for the use of}} ultra-fast switching semiconductors, like SiC and GaN, {{it is very difficult to}} realize low inductive packages. A new approach for embedded power modules will be presented, which can cover different application fields, ranging from 50 W over 500 W to 50 kW power modules for different applications like single chip packages, over power control units for pedelec (Pedal Electric Cycle), to inverter modules for automotive applications. This approach will focus on a power core base structure for with embedded semiconductors, which is then connected to a high power PCB. The connection to the embedded die is realized by a direct <b>copper</b> <b>connection</b> only. The technology principle will be described in detail. The embedding of chips offers a solution for many of the problems in power chip packages and power modules. While chip embedding was an academic exercise a decade ago, it is now an industrial solution [1]. A huge advantage of packaging using PCB technology is the cost-effective processing on large panel. Furthermore embedded packages and modules allow either double-side cooling or 3 D assembly of components like capacitors, gate drivers or controllers...|$|E
40|$|The {{exponential}} increase {{through time}} {{in the number of}} components in a typical integrated circuit, known as Moore's Law, is driving the need for improvements in manufacturing. A key semiconductor manufacturing process is chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP), which is used to create connecting metal channels above the transistors in a chip. A typical form of this process used in industry is metal CMP. Metal CMP is the process of using a pad combined with an abrasive slurry to remove excess material, such as Cu, and planarize a surface. The continuing trend {{to increase the number of}} components per chip leads to the necessity of Cu features being increasingly small. This increases the resistance of each <b>copper</b> <b>connection,</b> leading to an increase in the RC time delay of each circuit. To counteract the increase in resistance, the use of low dielectric constant (k) materials in place of SiO₂ has been explored. Low-k dielectrics are much softer than SiO₂, which has led to problems with scratching of the Cu during CMP, resulting in faulty parts. Recent research by Thor Eusner indicates that the pad used to polish the surface, not the abrasives in the slurry, may be responsible for the scratching of the Cu surface. This thesis applies this pad asperity scratching model to several CMP pads. The most relevant parameters to scratching, pad to copper hardness ratio and the coefficient of friction, are measured for each pad and the results indicate that scratching should be a problem with nearly all of the pads. This indicates that current CMP pads or slurries are too hard, have too much friction, have asperities that are too sharp, or some combination of these factors. Reengineering CMP pads and slurries is thus recommended to alleviate scratching by pad asperities. by Michael P. Roberts. Thesis (S. B.)

50|$|Transmuxing (Transmux: Transcode Multiplexing) is a {{telecommunications}} signaling format change between two signaling methods, typically {{synchronous optical network}} signals, SONET, and various time-division multiplexing, TDM, signals. Transmuxing changes the “container” without changing the “contents.” Transmuxing provides the carrier the capability to embed {{a telecommunications}} signal from one logical TDM circuit to another within SONET without physically breaking down the TDM circuit into its components and reconstructing it. There {{are two types of}} Transmuxing - Electrical Transmuxing and Optical Transmuxing (sometimes called portless transmuxing). In Electrical Transmuxing, TDM signals (typically DS1/T1 or DS3) are brought in using <b>copper</b> <b>connections,</b> transmuxed to SONET and transported across the network until the reverse occurs. In Optical Transmuxing, TDM signals (DS1/T1, DS3, OCx) are brought in using fiber optics, transmuxed to SONET and transported across the network until the reverse occurs. In the U.S. and Japan, DS1/T1 signals are transmuxed into a SONET virtual tributary called a VT1.5.|$|R
50|$|The {{history and}} long life of copper-based {{communications}} infrastructure {{is both a}} testament to the ability to derive new value from simple concepts through technological innovation - and a warning that copper communications infrastructure is beginning to offer diminishing returns for continued investment. However one of the largest costs associated with maintaining an ageing copper infrastructure is that of truck roll - sending engineers to physically test, repair, replace and provide new <b>copper</b> <b>connections,</b> and this cost is particularly prevalent in providing rural broadband service over copper. New technologies such as G.Fast and VDSL2 offer viable high speed solutions to rural broadband provision over existing copper. In light of this many companies have developed automated cross connects (cabinet based automated distribution frames) to eliminate the uncertainty and cost associated with maintaining broadband services over existing copper, these systems usually incorporate some for of automated switching and some include test functionality allowing an ISP representative to complete operations previously requiring a site visit (truck roll) from the central office via a web interface.|$|R
