40|$|Reverse {{transcriptase}} (RT) is a {{key enzyme}} in viral replication and susceptibility to ART and a crucial target of immunotherapy against drug-resistant HIV- 1. RT induces oxidative stress which undermines the attempts to make it immunogenic. We hypothesized that artificial secretion may reduce the stress and make RT more immunogenic. Inactivated multidrug-resistant RT (RT <b>1.</b> <b>14</b> opt-in) was N-terminally fused to the signal providing secretion of NS 1 protein of TBEV (Ld) generating optimized inactivated Ld-carrying enzyme RT <b>1.</b> <b>14</b> oil. Promotion of secretion prohibited proteasomal degradation increasing the half-life and content of RT <b>1.</b> <b>14</b> oil in cells and cell culture medium, drastically reduced the residual polymerase activity, and downmodulated oxidative stress. BALB/c mice were DNA-immunized with RT <b>1.</b> <b>14</b> opt-in or parental RT <b>1.</b> <b>14</b> oil by intradermal injections with electroporation. Fluorospot and ELISA tests revealed that RT <b>1.</b> <b>14</b> opt-in and RT <b>1.</b> <b>14</b> oil induced IFN-gamma/IL- 2, RT <b>1.</b> <b>14</b> opt-in induced granzyme B, and RT <b>1.</b> <b>14</b> oil induced perforin production. Perforin secretion correlated with coproduction of IFN-gamma and IL- 2 (R = 0, 97). Both DNA immunogens induced strong anti-RT antibody response. Ld peptide was not immunogenic. Thus, Ld-driven secretion inferred little change to RT performance in DNA immunization. Positive outcome was the abrogation of polymerase activity increasing safety of RT-based DNA vaccines. Identification of the molecular determinants of low cellular immunogenicity of RT requires further studies.

40|$|Human {{arylamine}} N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT 1) is a phase II cyto-solic enzyme {{responsible for}} the activation or deactivation of many arylamine compounds including pharmaceuticals and environmen-tal carcinogens. NAT 1 is highly polymorphic and has been associ-ated with altered risk toward many cancers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Walking across {{unstable}} surfaces disturbs normal {{stability and}} efficient strategies {{must be used}} to avoid falls. This study identified age-related changes in gait during unstable surface walking. METHOD: Eight healthy younger-old adults (YOG, mean age, 68. 6 years) and eight healthy older-old adults (OOG, mean age, 82. 1 years) were assessed. Both groups performed the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) and walked on a rigid and on a compliant surface while kinematic data were obtained. RESULTS: The OOG needed more time to complete the TUG test compared to YOG (F <b>1,</b> <b>14</b> = 5. 18; p= 0. 04). The gait speed, stride length and vertical displacement of the foot were similar for both groups, but they were slower (F <b>1,</b> <b>14</b> = 5. 64; p= 0. 03) when walking on the compliant surface. The knee and hip range of motion on the sagittal plane (F <b>1,</b> <b>14</b> = 191. 9; p< 0. 001 and F <b>1,</b> <b>14</b> = 36. 4, p< 0, 001, respectively) increased on the complaint surface but no group effect was found. The displacement of upper trunk on the frontal plane was similar between groups (F <b>1,</b> <b>14</b> = 2. 43; p= 0. 14) and conditions (F <b>1,</b> <b>14</b> = <b>1.</b> 15; p= 0. 3). The OOG had greater displacement of the pelvic segment on the frontal plane than the YOG (F <b>1,</b> <b>14</b> = 4. 9; p= 0. 04) mainly for the complaint surface. CONCLUSIONS: Older-old individuals have slower TUG test and greater displacement of the pelvic segment on a compliant surface.

40|$|Long chain alkyl diols form a {{group of}} lipids {{occurring}} widely in marine environments. Recent studies have suggested several palaeoclimatological applications for proxies based on their distributions, but also revealed uncertainties about their applicability. Here we evaluate the use of long chain <b>1,</b> <b>14</b> -alkyl diol indices for reconstruction of temperature and upwelling conditions by comparing index values, obtained from a comprehensive set of marine surface sediments, with environmental factors like sea surface temperature (SST), salinity and nutrient concentrations. Previous cultivation efforts indicated a strong effect of temperature {{on the degree of}} saturation and the chain length distribution of long chain <b>1,</b> <b>14</b> -alkyl diols in Proboscia spp., quantified in the diol saturation index (DSI) and diol chain length index (DCI), respectively. However, values of these indices in surface sediments show no relationship with annual mean SST of the overlying water. It remains unknown what determines the DSI, although our data suggests that it may be affected by diagenesis, while the relationship between temperature and DCI may be different for different Proboscia species. In addition, contributions of algae other than Proboscia diatoms may affect both indices, although our data provide no direct evidence for additional long chain <b>1,</b> <b>14</b> -alkyl diol sources. Two other indices using the abundance of <b>1,</b> <b>14</b> -diols vs. <b>1,</b> 13 -diols and C 30 1, 15 -diols have previously been applied as indicators for upwelling intensity at different locations.
