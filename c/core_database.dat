25|$|Workgroup: SQL Server Workgroup Edition {{includes}} the <b>core</b> <b>database</b> functionality {{but does not}} include the additional services. Note that this edition has been retired in SQL Server 2012.|$|E
25|$|Enterprise: SQL Server Enterprise Edition {{includes}} both the <b>core</b> <b>database</b> engine and add-on services, {{with a range}} of tools for creating and managing a SQL Server cluster. It can manage databases as large as 524 petabytes and address 12 terabytes of memory and supports 640 logical processors (CPU cores).|$|E
25|$|Standard: SQL Server Standard edition {{includes}} the <b>core</b> <b>database</b> engine, {{along with the}} stand-alone services. It differs from Enterprise edition in that it supports fewer active instances (number of nodes in a cluster) and does not include some high-availability functions such as hot-add memory (allowing memory to be added while the server is still running), and parallel indexes.|$|E
30|$|A {{systematic}} {{literature review}} was conducted using the <b>core</b> <b>databases</b> (MEDLINE through PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library). The {{data about the}} association between IHD {{and the development of}} colorectal neoplasm were extracted and analyzed using odds ratio (OR). A random effect model was applied. The methodological quality of the enrolled studies was assessed by the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Publication bias was evaluated through the funnel plot with trim and fill method, Egger’s test, and the rank correlation test.|$|R

50|$|ELKI {{is modeled}} around a <b>database</b> <b>core,</b> {{which uses a}} {{vertical}} data layout that stores data in column groups (similar to column families in NoSQL <b>databases).</b> This <b>database</b> <b>core</b> provides nearest neighbor search, range/radius search, and distance query functionality with index acceleration {{for a wide range}} of dissimilarity measures. Algorithms based on such queries (e.g. k-nearest-neighbor algorithm, local outlier factor and DBSCAN) can be implemented easily and benefit from the index acceleration.The <b>database</b> <b>core</b> also provides fast and memory efficient collections for object collections and associative structures such as nearest neighbor lists.|$|R
25|$|SQL Server also {{includes}} {{an assortment of}} add-on services. While these are not essential for {{the operation of the}} database system, they provide value added services on top of the <b>core</b> <b>database</b> management system. These services either run as a part of some SQL Server component or out-of-process as Windows Service and presents their own API to control and interact with them.|$|E
25|$|Express: SQL Server Express Edition is a scaled down, free {{edition of}} SQL Server, which {{includes}} the <b>core</b> <b>database</b> engine. While there are no limitations {{on the number of}} databases or users supported, it is limited to using one processor, 1 GB memory and 10 GB database files (4 GB database files prior to SQL Server Express 2008 R2). It is intended as a replacement for MSDE. Two additional editions provide a superset of features not in the original Express Edition. The first is SQL Server Express with Tools, which includes SQL Server Management Studio Basic. SQL Server Express with Advanced Services adds full-text search capability and reporting services.|$|E

50|$|MediaWiki code is {{designed}} to allow for data to be written to a master database and read from slave databases, although the master {{can be used for}} some read operations if the slaves are not yet up to date. Metadata, such as article revision history, article relations (links, categories etc.), user accounts and settings can be stored in <b>core</b> <b>databases</b> and cached; the actual revision text, being more rarely used, can be stored as append-only blobs in external storage. The software is suitable for the operation of large scale wiki farms such as Wikimedia, which had about 800 wikis as of August 2011. However, MediaWiki comes with no built-in GUI to manage such installations.|$|R

30|$|The YDHS {{database}} {{is built}} on top of MySQL database and outputs the information as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) which is parsed via HTML 5 if the user’s browser is capable of handling it; otherwise standard AJAX calls are used. Ease of use {{was considered to be}} of importance and thus the user interface is simple and stripped from extraneous functionality commonly found on various <b>core</b> <b>databases</b> for biological information. YDHS provides a data export option in JSON format for computational parsing and for input to external analysis programs. The integration of different databases is done by dedicated PHP and Perl scripts. YDHS was used for the exploratory analysis of haplogroups and traits covered in this article. The Fig.  1 was drawn using Circos software ([URL] and YDHS data.|$|R
40|$|As {{the amount}} of {{biological}} data grows, so does the need for biologists to store and access this information in central repositories in a free and unambiguous manner. The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) hosts six <b>core</b> <b>databases,</b> which store information on DNA sequences (EMBL-Bank), protein sequences (SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL), protein structure (MSD), whole genomes (Ensembl) and gene expression (ArrayExpress). But just as a cell would be useless if it couldn’t transcribe DNA or translate RNA, our resources would be compromised if each existed in isolation. We have therefore developed a range of tools that not only facilitate the deposition and retrieval of biological information, but also allow users to carry out searches that reflect the interconnectedness of biological information. The EBI’s databases and tools are all available on our website at www. ebi. ac. uk...|$|R
40|$|The Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD) was de-veloped {{to provide}} a {{centralized}} system {{for the study of}} polymorphism in genes of the immune system.

40|$|The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) {{integrates}} {{data from}} more than 20 biological databases through a flexible search and retrieval system called Entrez. A <b>core</b> Entrez <b>database,</b> Entrez Nucleotide, includes GenBank and is tightly linked to the NCBI Taxonomy database, the Entrez Protein database, and the scientific literature in PubMed. A suite of more specialized databases for genomes, genes, gene families, gene expression, gene variation, and protein domains dovetails with the <b>core</b> <b>databases</b> to make Entrez a powerful system for genomic research. Linked to {{the full range of}} Entrez databases is the NCBI Map Viewer, which displays aligned genetic, physical, and sequence maps for eukaryotic genomes including those of many plants. A specialized plant query page allow maps from all plant genomes covered by the Map Viewer to be searched in tandem to produce a display of aligned maps from several species. PlantBLAST searches against the sequences shown in the Map Viewer allow BLAST alignments to be viewed within a genomic context. In addition, precomputed sequence similarities, such as those for proteins offered by BLAST Link, enable fluid navigation from unannotated to annotated sequences, quickening the pace of discovery. NCBI Web pages for plants, such as Plant Genome Central, complete the system by providing centralized access to NCBI's genomic resources as well as links to organism-specific Web pages beyond NCBI...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} bibliometric {{study of the}} {{development}} of computer science research in the People's Republic of China in the 21 st century, using data from the Web of Science, Journal Citation Reports and <b>CORE</b> <b>databases.</b> Focusing on the areas of data mining, operating systems and web design, it is shown that whilst the productivity of Chinese research has risen dramatically over the period under review, its impact is still low when compared with established scientific nations such as the USA, the UK and Japan. The publication and citation data for China are compared with corresponding data for the other three BRIC nations (Brazil, Russian and India). It is shown that China dominates the BRIC nations in terms of both publications and citations, but that Indian publications often have a greater individual impact. © The Author(s) 2012...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} federated database support for provisioning of telecommunication services. Provisioning telecommunication services means dealing with various heterogeneous data sources such as service data, product data, billing data, usage data etc. The paper reports our approach towards the use of federated database technology to provide uniform access to the various data sources. Apart from validating the usefullness of federated databases for service provisioning in general, we evaluated the suitability of a deductive and object oriented data model (DOOD) for database federation. Our approach {{is illustrated by the}} use of federated database technology for offering uniform access to a heterogeneous collection of network registration databases. These <b>databases</b> form the <b>core</b> <b>databases</b> on which most of the information systems supporting service provisioning are based. As an example we present leased lines provisioning. 1 Introduction The growing competition in the t [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The 16 S rRNA gene (16 S rDNA) is {{currently}} {{the most widely used}} gene for estimating the evolutionary history of prokaryotes, To date, there are more than 30 000 16 S rDNA sequences available from the <b>core</b> <b>databases,</b> GenBank, EMBL and DDBJ, This great number may cause a dilemma when composing datasets for phylogenetic analysis, since the choice and number of reference organisms are known to affect the resulting tree topology. A group of sequences appearing monophyletic in one dataset may not be so in another. This can be especially problematic when establishing the relationships of distantly related sequences at the division (phylum) level. In this study, a multiple-outgroup approach to resolving division-level phylogenetic relationships is suggested using 16 S rDNA data.
