Before Little Blue Run Lake was created, the power company told local residents that the project would create a local recreational and boating area. The lake covers 1,900 acres and the waste in the lake is prevented from escaping thanks to a 400-foot tall, 2,200-foot wide rock-and-earth dam.

The experimental investigation was carried out to obtain an improved database for modelling the flow of coarse-particle slurries. Tests were conducted using sand <b>slurries</b> and <b>coal</b> <b>slurries</b> in <b>pipes</b> of industrial scale. Frictional headlosses, delivered solids concentrations, concentration distributions and velocity distributions were measured as functions of in situ solids concentration and mean velocity.

40|$|In this {{research}} project are determining {{the rate of}} oxidation of pyrite associated with coaly particles (<b>coal</b> <b>slurry</b> solid) when the pH of the surrounding environment is held at approximately 7. 8. Coaly particles that contain pyrite are generated during the preparation of Illinois Basin coal for market. These particles are discharged to an impoundment, which eventually must be reclaimed. The purpose for reclamation is either to prevent the generation of acidic solution as the pyrite in the <b>coal</b> <b>slurry</b> solid reacts with air, or to prevent the migration of the acidic solution to a groundwater aquifer. The reclamation is usually accomplished by covering the impoundment with a four-foot-thick layer of topsoil. One possible alternative method for reclamation of a <b>coal</b> <b>slurry</b> impoundment is to mix in alkaline residue from the fluidized-bed combustion of coal. This codisposal would slow the production of acid and would also neutralize any acid produced. If the codisposal method {{is found to be}} environmentally acceptable, it will save the coal mining companies part of their cost of reclamation, and also provide a safe and useful disposal outlet for a portion of the residue that is generated by the fluidized-bed combustion of coal. Pyrite oxidation experiments were conducted during the quarter in the following manner. Air, free of carbon dioxide, is bubbled through water in a covered beaker.

40|$|The {{formation}} and subsequent burnout behaviour of <b>coal</b> <b>slurry</b> fuel chars {{has been studied}} using a suspended single droplet technique and solid sampling techniques in large turbulent diffusion flames. Both these techniques yielded comparable results {{on the structure of}} carbonaceous residues from a range of <b>coal</b> <b>slurry</b> fuels containing <b>coals</b> of different rank, size and concentration. The structure and burnout behaviour of all the fuels tested was dependant on coal rank, particle size, and concentration, although these variables did not always produce the same differences in behaviour in coal-oil and coal-water chars. Mid-rank coals, produced swollen well-fused chars which were substantially hollow and incorporated large surface blowholes. Such residues showed little tendency to fragment during combustion. Low and high rank coals produced less swollen chars which were comprised of loosely agglomerated coal particles causing more extensive internal structure and smaller surface blowholes. The furnace results of this and other studies indicate that the latter type of char structure is more conducive to rapid to rapid burnout. Small concentrations of emulsified water in coal-oil slurries were observed to increase the intensity of ebullition during devolatilisation although no evidence was obtained from any of the experimental techniques to suggest that this caused droplet shattering. However, water addition did increase the rate of combustion of coal-oil fuels. A theoretical model of the behaviour of <b>coal</b> <b>slurry</b> fuel chars during combustion has been presented which explains the experimental results in terms of the internal surface area of the char and the availability of this area to the gaseous reactants. It has been concluded that the rate of combustion of <b>coal</b> <b>slurry</b> chars of the size encountered in flames is largely controlled by the rate of internal diffusion of gaseous reactants and reaction within the porous char structure. The different reactivities of <b>coal</b> <b>slurry</b> fuels of different coal ranks has therefore been explained in terms of the various char structures which were observed The beneficial effects of water on the combustion of coal-oil fuels has also been explained within this theory since the addition of water could increase the porosity of the chars.
