The brunt of the Jacobite impact was taken by just two government regiments – Barrell's 4th Foot and Dejean's 37th Foot. Barrell's regiment lost 17 and suffered 108 wounded, {{out of a total}} of 373 officers and men. Dejean's lost 14 and had 68 wounded, with this unit's left wing taking a disproportionately higher number of casualties. Barrell's regiment temporarily lost one of its two colours.

By rights, the Brigade should have been incapable of the action yet those quoted as being there remark that it was the most memorable event of the entire rearguard action. At 5pm, with the Fusiliers on the right, the Bedfords on the left and the Northamptons in reserve, the Brigade formed up with the Babouef to Compeigne road on their right and the southern edge of the woods above Babouef to their left.

2500|$|Come May 1940, the two German {{divisions}} c/w {{their respective}} SS Regiments and additional heavy artillery regiments had little trouble overcoming the first obstacles {{and managed to}} reach the Grebbeline on the second day, although the 227th division would need more time, meeting more Dutch resistance on the way. The 207th division was supported by five artillery battalions and spearheaded by the fanatic SS Der Führer regiment. The latter had first raided the Arnhem fortifications near Westervoort and subsequently massed {{in the city of}} Wageningen opposing the Grebbeline. On the second day the SS regiment managed to take the forward defences, albeit that it took them all day and losses mounted considerably. The third day they managed to penetrate the front line near the Grebbeberg itself, fighting {{the rest of the day}} and evening to widen the gap. The SS was blocked by the last Dutch defence line though, causing the commander of the 207th division to move in his own division and move SS Der Fuhrer away to the north of the Grebbeberg. The SS Regiment had by then suffered severe losses, its third battalion was out of action entirely. Overnight the Dutch planned a major <b>counter</b> <b>attack</b> by four infantry battalions, which operation was poorly executed and moreover collided with an SS assault along the northern perimeter of the Grebbeberg defences mid day on the fourth day of the invasion. German dive bombers sealed the fate of both the Dutch <b>counter</b> <b>attack</b> and the local defences period. The 207th division assaults over the Grebbeberg itself had been successful too, although severe losses were absorbed. By the end of the day the German infantry stood in the village of Rhenen. Around night fall the Germans realized that the Dutch defences had moved back. A quick reaction force from SS motorized units was formed, but would not manage to overtake the Dutch forces, that had also left one or two blocking parties behind to slow potential enemies down. The battle of the Grebbeberg had demanded 420 Dutch and around 250 German KIA. The number of WIA was about quadruple those numbers. The Dutch had lost thousands of POW's too as well as a great deal of material and artillery pieces.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{descending}} the Maura Litharia hillock the Greeks {{were engaged}} by the Turkish detachment that had barricaded themselves inside houses. A {{quarter of an}} hour later the Turks had successfully repelled an attack, moreover the Greek right flank broke ranks and fled. The situation was reversed when a unit of Souliotes under Georgios Tzavelas mounted a second offensive, killing a Turkish officer and rallying deserters to return to the battlefield. Morale in the Turkish right flank plunged, those who managed to escape were intercepted west of the village and annihilated. Yet the Ottoman center and left flank held fast and Karaiskakis sought other ways to break the stalemate. 300 Greeks under Giotis Danglis passed west of the Zervospilies hill, taking a hill which was even higher than that the main Turkish force had occupied. This came as a complete surprise to Mustafa Bey, who led a Turkish <b>counter</b> <b>attack,</b> sword in hand. Being favored by the terrain, the Greeks crushed three waves of attackers within half an hour. In the meantime Karaiskakis overcame the resistance that faced him, reaching the Agios Georgios church. The Turkish camp was surrounded and besieged just as night fell and hostilities were suspended.|$|E
2500|$|On April 16, 1961 {{there were}} {{initially}} 11 targets that {{were scheduled to}} be attacked. The list later got narrowed down to 4. These 4 included the San Antonio Air Base, the Campo Liberated Air Base, and finally the naval bases located at Batabano and Nueca Gerona. Additionally, the number of B-26 crafts {{to be used in}} the strike was cut down from 15 to 5, which ultimately limited the US's air coverage. The CIA's Official History of the Bay of Pigs Operation notes that this left the Brigade air force open to attacks by Castro's forces. The document states that, [...] "There is no doubt that if there had been more JMATE aircraft and more aircrews, constant air cover would have been possible." [...] Both Kennedys ignored the fact that limited air strikes would prevent the Brigade air force from being effective because of the risk of <b>counter</b> <b>attack</b> by the Cuban air force. A White House staffer was quoted as saying, [...] "...the plan was to destroy Castro's air force on the ground before the battle began, and then provide air support, with an anti-Castro [...] "Air Force" [...] consisting of some two dozen surplus planes flown by Cuban exiles. That plan failed." [...] On the 18th of April there was an air transport scheduled from the USAF and that was the best day for the Brigade B-26’s mobilization to occur. During this strike there were no aircraft lost and there was a successful strike made on the Castro column moving from Playa Larga to Playa Giron. The Official History of this operation notes that there were several uncertainties as to the outcomes of various operations between April 17–19, 1961, including the number and identities of casualties of both pilots and Cuban civilians, as well as a question over the possible use of napalm by Acting Chief of the US Air section Garfield Thorsrud's aircraft on April 17, 1961. The Official History notes that the use of napalm had not been officially approved until the next day, April 18, 1961. 10 days later TIDE dropped 5 B-26 bombs.|$|E
