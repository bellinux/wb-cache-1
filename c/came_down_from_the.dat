5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E
5|$|News of the Donner Party's {{fate was}} spread eastward by Samuel Brannan, an elder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and journalist, who {{ran into the}} salvage party as they <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pass with Keseberg. Accounts of the ordeal first reached New York City in July 1847. Reporting on the event across the U.S. was heavily {{influenced}} by the national enthusiasm for westward migration. In some papers, news of the tragedy was buried in small paragraphs despite the contemporary tendency to sensationalize stories. Several newspapers, including those in California, wrote about the cannibalism in graphic exaggerated detail. In some print accounts, {{the members of the}} Donner Party were depicted as heroes, and California a paradise worthy of significant sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Monitor withdrew, Virginia had {{run aground}} {{at which time}} Commander Jones <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> spar deck {{only to find the}} gun crews not {{returning}} fire. Jones demanded to know why and was briefed by Lieutenant Eggleston that powder was low and precious and given Monitors resistance to shot after two hours of battle, maintained that continued firing at that point would only be a waste of ammunition. Virginia soon managed to break away and headed back towards Norfolk, believing that Monitor had withdrawn from battle. Greene, now in command, did not pursue Virginia and, like Worden, was under orders to stay with and protect Minnesota, an action for which he was later criticized.|$|E

25|$|Wellington ordered Colonel William Mayne's 1st Battalion of the Loyal Lusitanian Legion, the Idanha Militia Battalion, and six Legion guns {{to serve}} as an outpost to Mackenzie's corps.

25|$|By the {{following}} morning the city of Carrara was surrounded by soldiers {{under the command of}} General Nicola Heusch. A state of siege had been proclaimed by the Crispi government on January 16, 1894. Among those threatened with arrest were many quarry workers, who responded by declaring a general strike. Instead of going to work, they <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mountains and gathered around the military barracks where hundreds of prisoners had already been detained. Troops were then ordered to amass and, as soon as the crowd came near enough, they fired. Eleven deaths resulted, as well as numerous other casualties. (Other sources mention 8 people killed and 13 wounded). Armed bands dispersed into the mountains pursued by troops.|$|E
25|$|Barillas {{was unique}} among all liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his {{successor}} peacefully. When election time approached, he sent {{for the three}} Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be. Satisfied with the response of Reyna Barrios, Barillas made sure a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán Indigenous people <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mountains {{to vote for the}} general. The official agents did their job: Reyna was elected president and, so as not to offend the losing candidates, Barillas gave them checks to cover the costs of their presidential campaigns. Reyna Barrios of course received nothing, but he went on to become President on March 15, 1892.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to his scouts, Archduke John had a {{clear picture}} of his opponent's army. He ordered Frimont's advance guard to attack the French {{soldiers}} at Pordenone in the morning. At 6:00 am, the Austrians clashed with Sahuc's cavalry patrols. General-major Joseph von Wetzel's Grenz brigade attacked across the Noncello (Foncello) stream {{on the east side of}} the town, attracting the attention of the defending infantry. When General-major Josef von Schmidt's line brigade <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northeast, the French were compelled to stretch the 35th Line to cover the north side of town. Sahuc formed his horsemen north of the town, hoping to catch the Austrian attackers in the flank. But it was the French cavalry who were flanked when Frimont fell on them with four regiments of cavalry, routing them. Without cavalry support, the infantry in the town were forced to pull out.|$|E

25|$|On 8 February 1971, the ARVN {{struck at}} the Ho Chi Minh Trail {{from the east}} with Operation Lam Son 719. Just how {{expected}} this offensive was to the RLG is uncertain. It is said that Silver Buckle was planned as a diversion to Lam Son 719. It is also claimed that the RLG was totally surprised by the South Vietnamese offensive. While Royalist intent was unclear, PAVN reaction to Silver Buckle was not. On the night of 9 February, two PAVN infantry regiments backed by tanks, antiaircraft guns, and artillery overran the grossly outnumbered Royalists at Moung Nong. Royalist survivors filtered back 80 kilometers to regroup at Ban Houei Mun's airstrip. Meanwhile, PAVN Group 968 <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bolovens Plateau and attacked northward. They dispersed the other column of Silver Buckle, which also headed for Ban Houei Mun. By 11 February, Operation Silver Buckle ended in a full retreat.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, a {{rebellion}} led by João Vieira occurred. João Vieira {{and a number}} of revolutionaries <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bodopitá mountain range and invaded the city's market. They broke into some money boxes and destroyed a few things. The revolt spread out across the region. Over time the rebels grew in numbers and became well armed. They were led by Manoel de Barros Souza and Alexandre de Viveiros. One of the objectives of Alexandre de Viveiros was to break into the city jail and liberate all the prisoners, including the father of Manoel de Barros Souza. They also planned to set the municipal offices on fire in order to destroy all the records kept there. However, over the next number of months the police force disrupted their plans. Alexandre de Viveiros was eventually imprisoned, but João Vieirad disappeared. After the revolt, the police abused the population without cause, arresting or punishing innocent citizens. Thus, the average person suffered both from the rebels and the police.|$|E
25|$|At 0100 on 24 March, Dac Cong {{managed to}} disable the TACAN beacon at Skyline One; the TACAN was crucial for {{directing}} U.S. Air Force air strikes. To retake it, the makeshift guerrilla battalion from MR 1 was enticed by $1 per day combat pay to reclaim Skyline Ridge. Given gunship support and issued new M16 rifles, the guerrillas stormed the hill. Vang Pao ordered their continued advance northward toward Sam Thong. By 26 March, having advanced with steadily increasing {{tactical air support}} as weather cleared, they were perched on hilltops south of Sam Thong. Unknown to them, the communist defenders scattered from Sam Thong into the nearby jungle. CIA case agent Tony Poe, who had scraped together the various smaller units he had amalgamated into an ad hoc MR 1 battalion to be shipped to MR 2, had followed them into action. He flew into Sam Thong on 27 March and contacted his troops. They <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hills, and by 1500 hours on 27 March 1970, Sam Thong was reoccupied by Royalists.|$|E

25|$|The marches of Doriath {{became a}} battleground between Orcs and the Grey Elves. Orcs sent by Sauron came south in force, but the Men of Brethil, {{aided by the}} Sindar of Doriath led by Beleg, {{destroyed}} an Orc-legion at the crossing of Taeglin in 458. Thingol and the Sindar of Doriath defeated the Orc-army occupying East Beleriand on Radhrim, the East March, in 462 and crushed the Orc-host of Boldog on the North March, in 465. A sortie from Himring destroyed {{the remnants of the}} Orcs. The second assault on Hithlum would see Galdor, Lord of Dor-lómin, die defending Barad Eithel. Morgoth launched a two pronged assault in 462, one Orc-host lay siege to forts of the mountain passes of Ered Wethrin while the other <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north, crossing the ice and attacking Fingon on the plains of Hithlum. Húrin, son of Galdor and the new lord of Dor-lómin, routed the armies of Morgoth and drove them back at Barad Eithel. Fingon, outnumbered on the plains, was reinforced by Círdan and the Falathrim who sailed to his rescue in great strength, landing their warriors near the Gate of the Noldor. The Orc-host, caught between the armies of Hithlum and Falas, was destroyed. In 465 Lúthien with the help of Huan first overthrew Sauron and destroyed his fortress Tol-in-Gaurhoth and then in 466, with Beren, in the depths of Angband, they took a Silmaril from the Crown of Morgoth achieving what all the swords and armies and plans of the Noldor had failed to in nearly 500 years of war.|$|E
25|$|Alan Davidson <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{pavilion}} end {{like a man}} possessed and bowled {{with great}} pace, far more than his controlled fast-medium. David Sheppard was caught {{in front of the}} wicket lbw for 0, Ted Dexter's off-stump was missed by a coat of varnish and Geoff Pullar was bowled through the gate. Colin Cowdrey came in at 19/2, but with bags of confidence after hitting 307 (with 4 sixes and 29 fours) against South Australia, his highest first-class score and the best by a tourist in Australia. Together Dexter and Cowdrey withstood Davidson's burst of speed, the other bowlers failed to trouble them and by stealing quick ones, twos and threes they rebuilt the innings. Occasionally Dexter would strike out {{and at the end of}} a long, hot day he gave Bobby Simpson a catch of Benaud (1/82) and was out for 93, his third missed century in three innings. The stand had made 175 runs and the unluckiest bowler was Norm O'Neill (0/19) who had Cowdrey dropped on 56 and dropped a hard-hit return from Dexter on 89. Cowdrey ended the day on 94 not out with Ken Barrington on 11, England 210/3 - still 106 runs behind - and the game very much in the balance. They returned the next day and Cowdrey made his third and highest century in Australia, having made 102 in Melbourne in 1954-55 and 100 not out in Sydney in 1958-59. The celebrations were short lived when Cowdrey (113) hooked into the hands of Peter Burge off Garth McKenzie, who then had Barrington (35) was lbw to a ball that cut back. Tom Graveney might have given England a real lead, but his was run out by a cracking throw from Neil Harvey for 41 and the last 4 wickets fell for 16 runs as Davidson (6/75) returned the clean up the tail; Fred Titmus caught behind, Fred Trueman skying the ball to O'Neill, Brian Statham having his stumps turned over and Len Coldwell edging to Benaud in the gully. Alan Smith was left 6 not out and England were out for 331, a lead of 15 runs when they had looked set for far more, or far worse.|$|E

500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E
