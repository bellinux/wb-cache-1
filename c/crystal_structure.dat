5|$|Crystallographic {{structure}} of fsTnI in troponin complex from chicken fast skeletal muscle showed an overall structure {{similar to that}} of cardiac troponin. The inhibitory region of fsTnI was resolved in skeletal troponin whereas it was invisible in the cardiac troponin <b>crystal</b> <b>structure.</b> Based on the <b>crystal</b> <b>structure,</b> a schematic illustration (Fig. 3) was proposed to show the conformational changes in troponin during muscle activation and relaxation.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} has a <b>crystal</b> <b>structure</b> {{analogous}} {{to that of}} diamond. Consistent with diamond being less stable than graphite, the cubic form is less stable than the hexagonal form, but the conversion rate {{between the two is}} negligible at room temperature, as it is for diamond. The cubic form has the sphalerite <b>crystal</b> <b>structure,</b> {{the same as that of}} diamond, and is also called β-BN or c-BN.|$|E

Similar offset parallel or perpendicular geometries were observed in a survey of high-resolution x-ray protein <b>crystal</b> <b>structures</b> in the Protein Data Bank. Analysis of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, histidine, and tryptophan indicates that dimers of these side chains have many possible stabilizing interactions at distances larger than the average van der Waals radii.|$|R

The beta modification (β-SiC), with a zinc blende <b>crystal</b> <b>structure</b> (similar to diamond), is formed at temperatures below 1700°C. Until recently, the beta form has had relatively few commercial uses, although there is now increasing interest in its use as a support for heterogeneous catalysts, owing to its higher surface area compared to the alpha form.|$|E

40|$|This {{overview}} {{describes an}} application of contemporary geometric topology and stochastic process concepts to structural crystallography. In this application, crystallographic groups become orbifolds, <b>crystal</b> <b>structures</b> become Morse functions on orbifolds, and vibrating atoms in a crystal become vector valued Gaussian measures with the Radon-Nikodym property. Intended crystallographic benefits include new methods for visualization of space groups and <b>crystal</b> <b>structures,</b> analysis of the thermal motion patterns seen in ORTEP drawings, and a classification scheme for <b>crystal</b> <b>structures</b> based on their Heegaard splitting properties. 1 Introduction Geometric topology and structural crystallography concepts are combined to define a research area we call Structural Crystallographic Topology, or just Crystallographic Topology.
