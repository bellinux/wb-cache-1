40|$|The {{problem of}} glass {{degradation}} in the glass-to-metal seals in lithium/sulfur dioxide cells is discussed. The glass degradation mechanism {{is attributed to}} lithium reacting with glass which {{is a result of}} deposition of lithium at the glass/metal/electrolyte interface. The worst degradation was observed when cells were stored in the inverted position. Alternate sealing methods were examined and a modified Ziegler seal is considered {{to be one of the}} best possible methods. The seal consists of a <b>crimp</b> <b>type</b> soft seal using a plastic annulus and a metal tube. Results of degradation tests are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} is studied of a stitched uniweave fabric composite {{and that of}} a toughened tape composite. The effects of stitching on compression fatigue life are addressed. Post impact compression fatigue and open hole fatigue tests were run on an AS 4 / 3501 - 6 uniweave with stitching and a toughened IM 7 / 8551 - 7 tape without stitching. Stitching was found to increase the thickness and consequently {{the weight of the}} composite material. The two materials were compared on an equal carbon content basis as well as on an equal weight basis. The excess thickness in the stitched uniweave composite was responsible for the lower fatigue life, on an equal carbon basis, compared to the toughened resin tape composite. Comparison of fatigue lives on an equal carbon content basis indicated that puncture or <b>crimp</b> <b>type</b> damage from stitching has very little effect on compression failure. Post impact fatigue test showed that although the damage area in the stitched uniweave composite was twice that of the toughened tape composite, the fatigue lives of the stitched composite were significantly longer than those of the toughened composite. Thus, it appears that the increase in thickness from stitching is much more of a penalty than crimped fibers or puncture type damage from stitching...|$|E

50|$|MIL-PRF-29504 (formerly MIL-T-29504) is a {{performance}} specification describing the general requirements for removable <b>crimp</b> and epoxy <b>type</b> fiber-optic termini {{for use in}} connectors and similar components. These termini are unique for military applications and must operate satisfactorily in systems under demanding conditions of 10 g's vibration (10 g's), shock (over 1000 g's), and temperature excursions (from -40 degrees C to +70 degrees C).|$|R
5000|$|Primer pocket swages can {{be either}} standalone, bench-mounted, {{specialized}} presses, or, alternatively, a special swage anvil die that can be mounted into a standard [...] "O" [...] style reloading press, along with a special shell holder insert with either a large or a small primer pocket insert swage that is then inserted into the position on the [...] "O" [...] press where a normal shell holder is usually clicked into position. This way, both small and large primer pockets on different types of military cases can be properly processed to remove primer pocket <b>crimps.</b> Both <b>types</b> of presses {{can be used to}} remove either ring crimps or stab crimps found on military cartridges when reloading them. Reamers for removing primer pocket crimps are not associated with presses, being an alternative to using a press to remove military case primer pocket crimps.|$|R

The present study was Performed on the Finned tube Heat exchanger. The finned tube having dimension of of (40 cm) overall length, which contains (32 cm) copper tube of (16 mm) outer diameter & inner diameter(13. 5) with fin pitch (10 fin/in), fin outer diameter(34. 5 mm) and fins thickness (0. 1 mm) [...] and the tubes material ad braas.

40|$|The {{development}} of a new ultrasonic measurement technique to assess quantitatively wire crimp terminations is discussed. The amplitude change of a compressional ultrasonic wave propagating at right angles to the wire axis and through the junction of a crimp termination is shown to correlate with the results of a destructive pull test, which is a standard for assessing crimp wire junction quality. To demonstrate the technique, the case of incomplete compression of crimped connections is ultrasonically tested, and the results are correlated with pull tests. Results show that the nondestructive ultrasonic measurement technique consistently predicts good crimps when the ultrasonic transmission is above a certain threshold amplitude level. A quantitative measure {{of the quality of the}} crimped connection based on the ultrasonic energy transmitted is shown to respond accurately to crimp quality. A wave propagation model, solved by finite element analysis, describes the compressional ultrasonic wave propagation through the junction during the crimping process. This model is in agreement within 6 % of the ultrasonic measurements. A prototype instrument for applying this technique while wire crimps are installed is also presented. The instrument is based on a two-jaw <b>type</b> <b>crimp</b> tool suitable for butt-splice type connections. A comparison of the results of two different instruments is presented and shows reproducibility between instruments within a 95 % confidence bound...|$|R
