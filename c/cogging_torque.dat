The amount of <b>cogging</b> <b>torque</b> is significantly influenced by the structural design. Regardless of the type of measurement, the load machine drives the currentless test object. The <b>cogging</b> <b>torque</b> is measured with a torque transducer connected between the test object and the load machine. The <b>cogging</b> <b>torque</b> can be determined in two different ways: Measurement of the <b>cogging</b> <b>torque</b> at slow speed or measurement of the <b>cogging</b> <b>torque</b> with closed-loop position control.

50|$|<b>Cogging</b> <b>torque</b> of {{electrical}} motors is the torque {{due to the}} interaction between the permanent magnets of the rotor and the stator slots of a Permanent Magnet (PM) machine. It is also known as detent or 'no-current' torque.

It is found that a SPM type machine is recommended, since both PS-FRPM and MG machines operating in SPM modes have a higher phase back-EMF and hence torque than their RPM counterparts, respectively, {{as a result of}} a similar phase flux-linkage but a higher electric frequency since the iron piece number is larger than the PM pole-pair number. Moreover, a smaller gear ratio machine is preferred from the perspective of a higher power factor and hence a lower inverter power rating, as the conventional MG machines with higher gear ratios suffer from larger flux-leakage, higher synchronous reactance and hence lower power factors, as well as higher iron losses, than the PS-FRPM machines. However, higher gear ratio machines feature lower <b>cogging</b> <b>torques</b> and torque ripples due to the smaller difference between the PM pole-pair number and iron piece number. Both prototypes of PS-FRPM machine operating in SPM mode and MG machine operating in RPM mode are built and tested to verify the FE predicted results. ...|$|R
40|$|Cogging in {{a linear}} machine can be {{described}} as a variation in the magnetic forces as the machine travels along its linear uis. This effect can have a severe impact on the overall precision and even stability of the linear uis. In this paper an analytical method to predict the cogging forces in Linear Induction Moton (LIMs) is presented. An aecurate estimation of cogging is useful during the LIM design stage to help millimize this performance limiting factor. One common method used to predict <b>cogging</b> <b>torques</b> in rotary induction moton is the tooth overlap method. Due to the complexity of slot fringing effects in slotted cores, and the fact that fringing effects significantly influence the accuracy of this method, many researchers alJo use Carter and Green coefficients to increase accuracy. However, this approach does not accurately translate to the linear motor case. In this paper an estimation of the magnetic flux path (based on FEM simulations) is used, along with the gradient ofthe magnetic energy stored in the air gap, to predict the cogging forces in an LIM.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{find the}} optimal winding {{topology}} for a 14 -pole permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) {{to be used as}} an in-wheel motor in automotive applications. Design/methodology/approach – Comparison is first performed among lap windings with different combinations of slot numbers and pole numbers. A general method for calculating the winding factors using only these numbers is proposed, thus the preferable slot numbers resulting in relatively large winding factors for this 14 -pole PMSM are found. With these slot numbers, the Joule losses of armature windings are further investigated, where the impacts of different end-winding lengths are considered. By this means, the optimal slot number that causes the least Joule loss is obtained. On the other hand, as a competitor to lap windings, toroidal windings are also discussed. The thermal performances of these two types of windings are compared by performing a finite element analysis (FEA) on their 2 -D thermal models. Findings – For the 14 -pole in-wheel PMSM discussed in this paper, the preferable slot numbers leading to relatively large winding factors are 12, 15 and 18. However, with the specified geometry constraints, the optimal choice of slot number is 15, which results in the least Joule loss and thus the highest efficiency. On the other hand, by implementing the toroidal winding topology, the armature windings of this machine can be effectively cooled and thus allow a larger electrical loading than the lap windings do. Research limitations/implications – This work can be continued with investigating the impacts of different combinations of slot number and pole number on harmonics and <b>cogging</b> <b>torques.</b> Originality/value – This paper proposes a general method for calculating the winding factor of PMSMs using only the phase number, the slot number, and the pole number.

40|$|Stepper motors {{are widely}} used on most {{spacecraft}} mechanisms requiring repeatable and reliable performance. The unique detent torque characteristics of these type of motors makes them behave differently when subjected to low duty cycle excitations where the applied driving pulses are only energized {{for a fraction of}} the pulse duration. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in discrete permanent magnet stepper motors used in the space industry. While the inherent high detent properties of discrete permanent magnets provide desirable unpowered holding performance characteristics, it results in unique behavior especially in low duty cycles. Notably, the running torque reduces quickly to the unpowered holding torque when the duty cycle is reduced. The space industry's accepted methodology of calculating the Motorization Ratio (or Torque Margin) is more applicable to systems where the power is continuously applied to the motor coils like brushless DC motors where the <b>cogging</b> <b>torques</b> are low enough not to affect the linear performance of the motors as a function of applied current. This paper summarizes the theoretical and experimental studies performed on a number of space qualified motors under different pulse rates and duty cycles. It is the intention of this paper to introduce a new approach to calculate the Motorization Ratios for discrete permanent magnet steppers under all full and partial duty cycle regimes. The recommended approach defines two distinct relationships to calculate the Motorization Ratio for 100 percent duty cycle and partial duty cycle, when the motor detent (unpowered holding torque) is the main contributor to holding position. These two computations reflect accurately the stepper motor physical behavior {{as a function of the}} command phase (ON versus OFF times of the pulses), pointing out how the torque contributors combine. Important points highlighted under this study are the torque margin computations, in particular for well characterized mechanisms. The rationale at CDR level versus TRR/TRB level will be discussed, aiming at avoiding too much conservatism for units that have extensive test and in flight heritage. A critical topic is related to the magnetic losses and how to sort out such phenomena as a function of the motor type being used. For instance, detent torque is a major contributor that has no reason to evolve during life and is not an uncontrolled torque loss...|$|R

The computationally efficient finite element-based approach developed in this work provides a framework of tools that allow rapid analysis of synchronous electric machines operating under steady-state conditions. In the developed modeling approach, major steady-state performance parameters such as, winding flux linkages and voltages, average, <b>cogging</b> and ripple <b>torques,</b> stator core flux densities, core losses, efficiencies and saturated machine winding inductances, are calculated with minimum computational effort. In addition, the method includes means for rapid estimation of distributed stator forces and three-dimensional effects of stator and/or rotor skew on the performance of the machine. The second contribution of this dissertation {{is the development of}} the design synthesis and optimization method based on a differential evolution algorithm. The approach relies on the developed finite element-based modeling method for electromagnetic analysis and is able to tackle large-scale multi-objective design problems using modest computational resources.
