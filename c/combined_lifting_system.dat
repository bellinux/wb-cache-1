40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the nonhomogeneous flow {{associated}} with a <b>system</b> <b>combining</b> <b>lifting</b> and propulsive requirements of an aircraft are considered by analytical and experimental methods. The basic geometry {{of the problem is}} that of two lifting surfaces with an actuator disk located between them. The principles governing flow with energy addition are examined. Basic equations and boundary conditions are developed for the complete inviscid and incompressible analysis for the two-dimensional case. The corresponding flow singularities are discussed and the integral equations which completely specify the system are derived. The two special cases of small and large energy addition are considered in detail including solutions. A numerical procedure is developed to solve the full problem including allowance for the wake deflection. Appropriate vorticity forms are used to represent the entire system. An iterative scheme is presented which rapidly converges to a solution for the magnitude and location of the system vorticity distributions. Forces and moments are evaluated on the propulsive <b>lift</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from the}} TV <b>lift</b> <b>systems,</b> {{there are also}} the related {{projector}} <b>lift</b> <b>systems.</b> These projector <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> may be distinguished into two equipment groups. On the one hand there is the projector ceiling light, which vertically lowers the projector downwards from a suspended ceiling, and there are projector lifts for integration into tables or furniture. The latter moves the projector vertically upwards, out of the furniture or table. Both systems are mostly made from ultra light aluminium. Stable equipment guiding is achieved in most cases using scissors or special guides. A projector <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> is often driven by a tubular motor, or another electromotor, which moves a shaft accordingly. Then the lower platform which the projector stands on, can be lowered via special belts or chains. Projector ceiling <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> are available as ultra flat versions right up to stage projector lift devices with a lift of 5m and more, and a load bearing capacity of several 100 kg.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Holding {{the work}} piece for the forging press is the main task of the forging manipulator, and it is {{recognized}} as one of industry’s most arduous tasks. To ensure the safety of the manipulator mechanism, the resistance force exerted on the clamp must be minimized [1]. This paper focuses on the vertical load analysis of <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> for the forging manipulator when it works in cooperation with the forging press. First the equivalent stiffness model of {{the work piece}} is presented and the loads of the <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> are derived. Then the hydraulic circuits of the front and the rear <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> are investigated. Finally, the whole forging process is analyzed to study the relationship between the tracking error of the <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> and the resistance force on them. Simulation of one typical forging process shows that the cause of resistance force on the <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> is the displacement tracking error...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{advanced}} high <b>lift</b> <b>systems</b> on aircraft size, performance, {{direct operating cost}} and noise were evaluated for short-to-medium and medium-to-long range aircraft with high bypass ratio and very high bypass ratio engines.

These aircraft did, however, have smaller wings and lower engine thrusts for the same mission than aircraft with conventional high <b>lift</b> <b>systems.</b> When the advanced high <b>lift</b> <b>system</b> was implemented without reducing wing size and simultaneously using lower flap angles that provide higher L/D at approach a cumulative noise reduction of as much as 4 EPNdB was obtained.

40|$|ABSTRACT – The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to design the water <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> which is of human operated. In all over the world there are various types of water <b>lifting</b> <b>systems</b> currently in use. Some are electrically operated and some of them are mechanically operated and some are still traditional way of system. In India there are some basic types of water <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> still in use such as Hand Pump, rope well. It can be use in everywhere but it need more manual power. Now electrically water <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> is also in use. But drawback is electricity is costly and hence not efficient to use. Some of manual operated system is use like Traddle Pump and many other types of system using, but the design of this system is more critical and maintainance cost is high. The many water <b>lifting</b> <b>system</b> is not portable and does not reach the maximum height and also the rate of discharge is less.

Comparison of the analytical and experimental results is given in detail. The experimentally determined wake development is observed to be similar to the predicted shape.
