5|$|Not {{commonly}} cultivated, it adapts {{readily to}} garden conditions and tolerates most soils in part-shade or full sun. The colours of the inflorescences in bud, {{and timing of}} flowers into winter give it horticultural value, as does its reddish new growth. Larger plants have taller flower spikes. It is propagated readily from seed, with young plants taking {{five to seven years}} to flower from seed. Pruning <b>can</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> shrub's appearance, and it is a potential bonsai subject.|$|E
5|$|In both {{recording}} and in live musical sound reinforcement, {{the key to}} noise minimisation is headroom. Headroom can be used either to reduce distortion and audio feedback by keeping signal levels low, or to reduce interference, both from outside sources and from the Johnson-Nyquist noise produced in the equipment, by keeping signal levels high. Most proprietary noise reducing technologies also introduce low levels of distortion. Noise minimisation therefore becomes a compromise between interference and distortion, both in {{recording and}} in live music, and between interference and feedback in live amplification. The work of Bart Kosko and Sanya Mitaim has also demonstrated that stochastic resonance {{can be used as}} a technique in noise minimisation and signal improvement in non-linear dynamical systems, as the addition of noise to a signal <b>can</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
5|$|Nanostructures of ZnO can be {{synthesized}} into {{a variety}} of morphologies including nanowires, nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor-liquid-solid method. The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90°C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment. Certain additives, such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine, <b>can</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> aspect ratio of the ZnO nanowires. Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution. The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing the parameters relating to the precursor composition (such as the zinc concentration and pH) or to the thermal treatment (such as the temperature and heating rate).|$|E

5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early {{intervention}} programs, most are case reports {{of up to}} five participants and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants <b>can</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> work and life management of people with AS.|$|E
5|$|The Last Story is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game (ARPG) incorporating elements of tactical and stealth gameplay. The player controls main protagonist Zael {{for the majority}} of the game. Zael is primarily controlled using the Wii Remote from a fixed third-person view. The game can be controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, or the Classic Controller. The game's main hub is a public house on Lazulis Island, which also houses a save point for players. Lazulis City is the main setting for most of the game, which provides the player with story-related and side quests. In addition to environments within missions such as ruins and forests where enemies are encountered and fought, there is an arena where the player <b>can</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> party and their combat abilities. If the party is victorious, the party can pick up money and items from non-playable characters betting on the fight.|$|E
5|$|Weapons {{range from}} pistols to shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Although {{all of them}} have {{unlimited}} ammunition, they overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. In addition, the player can use grenades which latch onto targets or flat surfaces to be remotely detonated. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a health bar and damage-absorbing shields. The health bar only takes damage once the shields have been destroyed, but environmental hazards like heat or toxic agents may directly affect the health bar if they are not negated entirely by wearing appropriate armor. The health bar can be restored with the use of items called Medi-gels, while shields automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. Some talents and equipment items <b>can</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> healing rate or shield regeneration. The player can revive fallen squad members {{with the use of the}} Unity talent. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.|$|E

5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its flavour and aroma. Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom <b>can</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E
