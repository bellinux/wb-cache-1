5|$|Australian kites may be {{sedentary}} or nomadic, {{and generally}} occur in open grasslands or valleys {{where there are}} scattered <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> trees. In urban areas they are found {{on the edge of}} towns on wasteland, irregularly mown areas, or grassy roadside verges. They also hunt over coastal dunes, drier marshland, and farmland.|$|E
5|$|Substrates {{they are}} most {{commonly}} found on in their native habitats include beds and floating <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> macroalgae like Sargassum muticum, Sargassum miyabei, Sargassum pallidum, Neorhodomela larix, Polysiphonia morrowii, Cystoseira crassipes, Laminaria japonica, Chondrusspp., and Desmarestia viridis; {{as well as in}} marine plants (like eelgrass of the genus Zostera), hydrozoans, and bryozoans.|$|E
5|$|The {{yellowhammer}} is a bird of dry open country, preferably with a {{range of}} vegetation types and some trees from which to sing. It is absent from urban areas, forests and wetlands. Probably originally found at forest edges and large clearing, it has benefited from traditional agriculture, which created extensive open areas with hedges and <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> trees.|$|E

40|$|Resource defence theory {{predicts that}} defence and monopolization {{increase}} as the spatial clumping, spatial predictability, and temporal predictability of resources increase and as temporal <b>clumping</b> <b>of</b> resources decrease. Previous tests of resource defence theory have manipulated only {{one aspect of}} resource distribution at a time. I tested whether there was an interaction between the effects of the spatial and temporal <b>clumping</b> <b>of</b> food by allowing groups of ten Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to compete, over a 4 week period, for food in a 2 x 2 factorial design. As expected, the intensity of aggression increased as the spatial <b>clumping</b> <b>of</b> food increased and as the temporal <b>clumping</b> <b>of</b> food decreased. However, there was also a significant interaction between the effects of the spatial and temporal <b>clumping</b> <b>of</b> food on the intensity of aggression and total aggression. The number of fish in the feeding patch, a measure of monopolization, decreased as the spatial <b>clumping</b> <b>of</b> food increased, but was not affected by the temporal <b>clumping</b> <b>of</b> food. Although measures of aggression were high in the economically defendable trials, there was no apparent cost to resource defence, since mean growth rates did not differ significantly among treatments. Growth depensation increased over time, but was not influenced by the temporal or spatial distribution of food. The power of my experiment to detect a significant effect of food distribution on growth depensation was low. Therefore, although I failed to reject the null hypothesis, I cannot confidently conclude that the spatial and temporal <b>clumping</b> <b>of</b> food have no effect on the magnitude of growth depensation. My results suggest that care must be taken when extrapolating the results of single factor experiments to multi-factor or field situations...|$|R

5|$|Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds {{appear to}} be immune to {{infection}} and therefore are {{not considered to be}} a T. cruzi reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals {{that are part of the}} ancient, sylvatic (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> trees interspersed by human habitation.|$|E

5|$|The highest {{resolution}} Voyager 2 images {{revealed a}} pronounced clumpiness in the arcs, with a typical separation between visible <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> 0.1° to 0.2°, which corresponds to 100–200km along the ring.

5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common ink cap or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. <b>Clumps</b> <b>of</b> mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E
5|$|In February–March 2007 New Horizons {{spacecraft}} {{conducted a}} deep {{search for new}} small moons inside the main ring. While no satellites larger than 0.5km were found, the cameras of the spacecraft detected seven small <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> ring particles. They orbit just inside the orbit of Adrastea inside a dense ringlet. The conclusion, that they are clumps and not small moons, is based on their azimuthally extended appearance. They subtend 0.1–0.3° along the ring, which correspond to 1000–3000km. The clumps are {{divided into two groups}} of five and two members, respectively. The nature of the clumps is not clear, but their orbits are close to 115:116 and 114:115 resonances with Metis. They may be wavelike structures excited by this interaction.|$|E

5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals are {{associated}} with C.australis in healthy ecosystems. The most common epiphytes are ferns, astelias and orchids. Old trees often carry large <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> the climbing fern Asplenium, and in moist places, filmy ferns and kidney ferns cling to the branches. Astelia species and Collospermum often establish in the main fork of the tree, and one tree can host several species of native orchid. Other common epiphytes include Griselinia lucida, {{as well as a}} range of mosses, liverworts, lichens and fungi. Two fungus species which infect living tissue—Phanaerochaeta cordylines and Sphaeropsis cordylines—occur almost exclusively on C.australis.|$|E
5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the Universe, as <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins. About 70–80% of the mass in a cluster {{is in the form}} of dark matter, with 10–30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The planets {{were formed}} 4.6 {{billion years ago}} in the protoplanetary disk that {{surrounded}} the early Sun. Through a process that included gravitational attraction, collision, and accretion, the disk formed <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> matter that, with time, became protoplanets. The radiation pressure of the solar wind then expelled most of the unaccreted matter, and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere. The planets continued to sweep up, or eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment, evidenced by the many impact craters on the Moon. During this period, some of the protoplanets may have collided and one such collision may have formed the Moon.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} A.subrubescens are usually solitary, but {{sometimes}} several (typically {{between two and}} eight) are stuck together by the stem bases or {{on the sides of}} their caps. A strictly terrestrial species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with silver fir in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine. It is suspected that A.subrubescens may be mycorrhizal with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with David Arora, wrote that Arora encountered several <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> fruit bodies in an area in California containing mostly knobcone pine (a three-needle pine), manzanita, huckleberry and a few mandrones.|$|E
5|$|McMaster has {{received}} accolades for its research strengths, {{particularly in the}} field of health sciences. For five years in a row, McMaster has ranked second in for biomedical and health care research revenues by the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada. The Faculty of Health Science oversees $130 million a year in research, much of that research conducted by scientists and physicians who teach in the medical school. The Faculty of Health Sciences operates several research institutes, including the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, and the Population Health Research Institute. A McMaster research group led by David Sackett and later Gordon Guyatt had been credited for establishing the methodologies used in evidence-based medicine. In November 2010, researchers at the Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute turned <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> human skin into blood cells, which may help alleviate the shortage of blood donors. A portion of Albert Einstein's brain is preserved and held for medical research at the McMaster brain bank. Researchers there have identified differences in his brain that may relate to his genius for spatial and mathematical thinking.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2004 {{arrival of}} the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft, the rings of Saturn were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not {{expected}} to survive beyond another 300million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned. However, data from the Cassini mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10km-wide icy <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the rings fresh. Saturn's rings are far more massive than the rings of the other giant planets. This large mass {{is thought to have}} preserved Saturn's rings since it first formed 4.5billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.|$|E

5|$|The beak of the kakapo {{is adapted}} for {{grinding}} food finely. For this reason, the kakapo {{has a very}} small gizzard compared to other birds of their size. It is generally herbivorous, eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as kakapo food. It is particularly fond of {{the fruit of the}} rimu tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The kakapo has a distinctive habit of grabbing a leaf or frond with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. These little <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird. The kakapo is believed to employ bacteria in the fore-gut to ferment and help digest plant matter.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the {{fieldfare}} is slow and direct. It takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on. It is highly gregarious, quite shy and easily scared {{in the winter and}} bold and noisy in the breeding season. When a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction, keeping up a constant chatter. When foraging on the ground, often in association with redwings, the group works its way up wind, each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding. When alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms elsewhere. In woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes, instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches. They roost socially, sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground. Common sites are in rough grass among bushes or <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> rushes, in young plantations, on stubble and in the furrows of ploughed fields.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{formally}} designated as 'Nationally Rare' in the United Kingdom and categorised as a 'Species of Principal Importance' {{in accordance with}} the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. The Tansy Beetle Action Group was set up in 2008 to initiate and oversee conservation efforts and comprises representatives from the University of York, North Yorkshire County Council, City of York Council, Environment Agency and the National Trust. A recovery programme started, involving annual surveys of both tansy and beetles, control of tree shading and invasive plants that compete with tansy, such as Himalayan balsam, and limited re-introductions within the current species range. New <b>clumps</b> <b>of</b> tansy have been planted, particularly between isolated existing patches which may be beyond the 200m walking range of the beetle. In order to publicise the conservation project Rachael Maskell, the Member of Parliament for the constituency of York Central became a 'Tansy Beetle Species Champion' in 2016. That same year, a team of 30 volunteers surveyed a 90km stretch of the banks of the River Ouse. The surveying has identified an upward trend in population numbers, rising over 60% between 2015 and 2016 to 40,000 individuals.|$|E
