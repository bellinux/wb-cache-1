50|$|After his {{formative}} years in Manchester, Naqviâ€™s interest widened considerably. He investigated, {{in addition to}} photoluminescence of organic molecules, the photophysics of saturable absorbers (<b>cryptocyanine</b> and related dyes, then used for passive Q-switching of ruby lasers), and used their nonlinear behaviour for determining the subnanosecond lifetimes of their first excited singlet states. In 1973, he became interested in developing biophysical applications of spectroscopy, and used triplet probes to develop what had until then been among the desiderata of membrane research, optical methods for monitoring the translational and rotational mobility of membrane components. His theoretical analysis of diffusion-controlled reactions in lipid membranes led to the remarkable conclusion that in the two-dimensional case, one cannot speak of a rate constant. More than two decades later, his prediction was verified, and his expression for the rate parameter of a two-dimensional diffusion-controlled reaction was named as the Razi Naqvi kinetic law.|$|E
40|$|A Q-switched {{ruby laser}} {{operating}} in TEMOO mode, {{is used as}} an optical pump source for a <b>cryptocyanine</b> dye laser. A method of verifying TEMOO mode operation is given. Two novel techniques for longitudinal pumping of the dye laser are described. These depend on the phenomenon of depolarisation of the dye fluorescence. Measurements are performed on the energy conversion efficiency, output spectrum, and polarisation of a quasi-longitudinally pumped dye laser...|$|E
