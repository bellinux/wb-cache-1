40|$|Friction stir welding is an {{innovative}} weld process {{that continues to}} grow in use, in the commercial, defense, and space sectors. It produces high quality and high strength welds in aluminum alloys. The process consists of a rotating weld pin tool that plasticizes material through friction. The plasticized material is welded by applying a high weld forge force through the weld pin tool against the material during pin tool rotation. The high weld forge force is reacted against an anvil and a stout tool structure. A variation of friction stir welding currently being evaluated is self-reacting friction stir welding. Self-reacting friction stir welding incorporates two opposing shoulders on the crown and root sides of the weld joint. In self-reacting friction stir welding, the weld forge force is reacted against the crown shoulder portion of the weld pin tool by the root shoulder. This {{eliminates the need for}} a stout tooling structure to react the high weld forge force required in the typical friction stir weld process. Therefore, the self-reacting feature reduces tooling requirements and, therefore, process implementation costs. This makes the process attractive for aluminum alloy circumferential weld applications. To evaluate the application of self-reacting friction stir welding for aluminum alloy <b>circumferential</b> <b>welding,</b> a feasibility study was performed. The study consisted of performing a fourteen-foot diameter aluminum alloy circumferential demonstration weld using typical fusion weld tooling. To accomplish the demonstration weld, weld and tack weld development were performed and fourteen-foot diameter rings were fabricated.

Tack weld development evaluated gas tungsten arc welding and friction stir welding for tack welding rings together for <b>circumferential</b> <b>welding.</b> As a result of the study, a successful circumferential demonstration weld was produced leading the way for future circumferential weld implementation...|$|E

40|$|With the {{introduction}} of welding as joining method, the welding technology was applied as major joining technique in hi-tech industries to the welding of steels for manufacturing of different structures like pressure vessels and aerospace applications. Mostly {{high strength low alloy}} steels in thin cylindrical shell form are being used for  aerospace structures due to high strength and low weight ratio. Despite being high strength and light weight by numerous advantages, the welding of thin walled structure of high strength low alloy steel (also known as HSLA Steel) comes also with a major problems of weld induced imperfections due to high temperatures like residual stresses and distortions with shortening of weld strength and it is a still major challenge for the welding professionals due to the complex nature of the welding phenomenon despite many innovations in welding technology. The most of the weld induced imperfections are the result of transient temperature distributions and subsequent cooling of the welds followed by transient and residual stress fields. Where as, the reliability of thin-walled structures used for any aerospace or pressure vessel application is on the prime importance every time for safe operational. Usually, thin walled cylindrical structures contain two types of weld as longitudinal and circumferential. The major design and industry constraints are weld strength and cost competitive. Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) or TIG process is mostly applied due to the excellent weld strength and cost competitiveness. The main aim of this research work is to analyze and experimentally investigate the TIG welding parameters for purpose of minimizing residual stresses and distortion with the requirements of maximizing of weld strength of thin walled structures of HSLA steel respectively. To achieve the aforementioned targets, the following strategy was applied keeping in view the complex phenomena of welding, time and cost of extensive experimentations involved. Weld experiments were subdivided into linear and <b>circumferential</b> <b>welding.</b> Initially for linear welding, TIG welding parameters were analyzed to determine their significance on thin plates of HSLA steel of different thicknesses (3 to 5 mm) by following design of experiments (DOE) with employing 2 -level full factorial and response surface method (RSM) designs to have response (weld strength, distortion residual stress). Whereas for <b>circumferential</b> <b>welding,</b> a hybrid numerical simulation and experimental based analysis approach was employed to model and predict TIG welding process to investigate the transient temperature distributions, transient/residual stress fields and distortion for circumferentially welded thin-walled cylinders of HSLA steel. The simulations strategy was developed and implemented by using commercial available general purpose finite element software ANSYS® enhanced with subroutines. First thermal analysis was completed followed by a separate mechanical analysis based on the thermal history. From the three dimensional FE model developed for TIG welding process of <b>circumferential</b> <b>welding,</b> a series of virtual welding experiments based on statistical designs (DOE) were performed for response (residual stresses and distortion) with different thicknesses by using full factorial and RSM as applied for linear welding. The effects of following six parameters, four numeric and two categorical: welding current, welding voltage, welding speed, sheet/cylinder thickness and trailing (Ar) & weld type (linear and circumferential) were investigated upon following three performance measures: weld strength, residual stresses and distortions for different thicknesses of material of HSLA steel. The experimental results were analyzed using ANOVA and significance of effects of all the tested parameters upon performance measures was determined. Empirical models for weld strength, distortion and residual stresses, in terms of significant parameters, were also developed and numerical optimization was performed according to the desirability for the maximization of weld strength and minimization of distortion residual stresses. All the statistical analyses were performed by using commercial available statistical software Design-Expert® and MINITAB From the results of post-experimental analyses, it was noticed that the effects of welding current, welding voltage and welding speed upon weld strength, residual stresses and distortion are extremely significant, while the effect of trailing and weld type is also considerably significant with respect to material thicknesses. The residual stresses are highly sensitive to heat input (weld temperatures). The residual stresses and distortion in <b>circumferential</b> <b>welding</b> are low as compared to linear welding for the same welding parameters and material thickness respectively. The vital recommendation, in this regard, is to use the parameters of welding resulting low input heat (low current, low voltage and high speed) with application of trailing with respect to material thicknesses for the maximum weld strength and minimum residual stresses and distortion in thin walled structures of HSLA steel. For the trade-off among aforementioned opposing targets and for prediction of values of performance measures at different settings of TIG welding parameters, the expert system tool, employing fuzzy reasoning mechanism, was utilized. Initially, an expert system was developed for the optimization of parameters according to objectives of maximization and/or minimization of weld strength, distortion and residual stresses. The expert system also provided the predicted values of various performance measures based upon the finalized values of the welding parameters. The analyses, simulations, experimental and ANOVA results were utilized for the making of fuzzy rule-base. The fuzzy rule-base was adjusted for maximum accuracy by employing the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. In the next stage, a machine learning (ML) technique was utilized for creation of a expert system, named as EXWeldHSLASteel, that can: self-retrieve and self-store the experimental data; automatically develop fuzzy sets for numeric variables involved; automatically generate rules for optimization and prediction rule-bases; resolve the conflict among contradictory rules; and automatically update the interface of expert system according to newly introduced TIG welding process variables. The algorithms for these constituents were coded using a pointer-enabled language in C++. The coding involves a data structure named as doubly linked list, which provide the means for fast and efficient processing. The presented expert system is used for deciding the values of important welding process parameters as per objective before the start of actual welding process on shop floor. The user should be absolutely clear about the nature and requirements of any given TIG welding process, e. g., the setting parameters, fixed parameters, and geometric parameters etc. The expert system developed in the domain of welding for optimizing welding process of thin walled HSLA steel structure possesses all capabilities to adapt effectively to the unpredictable and continuously changing industrial environment of mechanical fabrication and manufacturing and to serve the newly emerging field of knowledge management by transforming individual (expert) knowledge into organizational knowledge i. e. implicit to explicit knowledg...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCoke drums undergo cyclic thermal and {{mechanical}} loading during operation, {{which tend to}} cause damage like bulging and cracking near <b>circumferential</b> <b>welds</b> in coke drums. In this paper, considering {{the existence of the}} overmatch welds and uneven temperature field during oil-feeding and water quenching as well as quenching conditions, the bulging behavior of the coke drum is investigated. Firstly, the uniaxial tension and ratchetting experiments of parent metal and weld of coke drum are carried out at 20 oC, 200 oC, 300 oC, and 400 oC. Secondly, the ratchetting strains are predicted by OW-II kinematic hardening model and the predicted ratchetting strain rates of steady stage are in qualitative agreement with the experimental results. By comparison, weld has significantly smaller ratchetting strain rate than parent metal under the same loading conditions, which shows that the anti-ratchetting ability of weld is better than that of parent metal. Thirdly, the transient temperature field during oil-feeding and water quenching are numerically simulated with the help of dynamic coordinate system method, which yields the axial temperature difference and its characteristic value for the simplified characteristic load {{to be used in the}} cyclic plastic analysis of coke drum cycled between oil-feeding and water quenching. Fourthly, the ratchet boundaries are determined under moving axial temperature gradient by cyclic plasticity analysis for the parent metal. It is found that, when temperature difference range of water quenching is smaller, the ratchet boundaries are heavily influenced by the cyclic internal pressure. Finally, considering the strength differences between parent metal and weld, cyclic plasticity analysis is done for the <b>circumferential</b> <b>weld</b> connection region of coke drum. The results indicate that the bulging is preferentially near and about 10 mm above the weld under given loading conditions. It is also observed that, for cylinder with or without the <b>circumferential</b> <b>weld,</b> the co-existence of cyclic internal pressure can increase the ratchetting strain of the structure and the ratchetting strain rate of structure also increases with the cyclic internal pressure range...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} an {{integrity}} {{assessment of a}} BWR core shroud {{in the region of}} its <b>circumferential</b> <b>welds.</b> To accurately evaluate the residual stresses in the weld region which are the dominant part of the component loading, numerical simulation of the welding process is performed. Calculations of the crack driving parameter, the stress intensity factor, are carried out for complete circumferential cracks at different locations using a numerical procedure, as well as by applying a weight function solution specially developed for cracks in a thin-walled cylinder, the geometry addressed in this paper. A matter of concern is also the applicability of linear-elastic fracture mechanics and the related K 1 -concept to describe crack behavior in welded components. As a particular task, the trend is studied for the stress intensity factor of a complete circumferential crack whose depth approaches the full wall thickness...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} how the technological issue of assuring stability of <b>circumferential</b> <b>welds</b> in mass production was solved and shows how resistance projection welding substituted for fusion arc welding. In the introduction, key technological reasons for replacing the welding process used are given. The study {{is supported by a}} detailed description of physical characteristics of resistance projection welding that assures the desired quality of a particular product. The initial experiments and analyses carried out, allowed limiting the range of the investigation conducted to a comparison of efficiency of welding with two different types of workpiece adjustment. The experimental section further includes a description of welding with front and edge adjustments and the choosing of suitable welding parameters. This is supported by the results of a quality evaluation of welds obtained in a visual examination, tensile testing, and a metallographic analysis...|$|R
40|$|The first European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) {{is being}} built {{on the site of}} Olkiluoto (Finland). The Finnish {{regulations}} of application impose that the Pre-Service and In-Service Inspections of the main primary components shall be performed with ultrasonic (UT) and Eddy current (ET) systems qualified according to ENIQ (European Network for Inspection Qualification) methodology. The scope of inspection is defined on the bases of ASME XI standard. Therefore the scope of qualifications will cover nearly 50 different inspection configurations in view of geometry, material and inspection targets. This paper aims at presenting the qualification process followed and at giving information and results on one of its applications: the qualification of UT system devoted to the examination of the surge line <b>circumferential</b> <b>welds.</b> IntelligeNDT System and Service GmbH, an AREVA and Siemens Company, is in charge of thi...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStudies {{carried out}} for a natural gas {{distribution}} company are presented, in which the causes {{that led to a}} leakage in a 4 “elbow are determined. The damage was detected in a tract under a highway; a major erosive process by solid particles from the outside was found during excavation. This erosive process, however, was not the cause of the failure, but a consequence of a gas leak from a through crack in the <b>circumferential</b> <b>weld.</b> The crack at the root toe of the weld propagated through the heat affected zone (HAZ) of the elbow. It was found that the chemical composition of the elbow did not match specification, high carbon equivalent contributed to brittleness in the HAZ. The failure is attributed to bending loads due to ground settlements and traffic of heavy vehicles on top of the right of way, during highway construction and repair...|$|R
