5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s {{the only}} fully trained crews were pilots, other crew members being volunteers from skilled ground trades who {{underwent}} short courses in gunnery and bomb aiming. Pilots {{were responsible for}} navigation, and when accurate navigation was essential, a second pilot was carried. Early in 1936 the Air Navigation School had been formed at RAF Manston to take over this training for all pilots destined for Coastal and Bomber Commands. <b>Conversion</b> <b>training</b> for Flying Boats was also given there.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron is {{currently}} {{responsible for providing}} <b>conversion</b> <b>training</b> on the King Air and conducting light transport operations. The unit has a strength of 60 RAAF personnel as well as 25 aircraft maintenance contractors from Hawker Pacific. It is organised into two flights; A Flight undertakes transport operations, and B Flight is responsible for delivering training courses. Along with Nos. 33 and 36 Squadrons, No. 38 Squadron forms part of No. 86 Wing.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{commissioned}} as a {{pilot officer}} midway through his Korean service, Newham's next posting was with No. 78 (Fighter) Wing on Malta, where he flew de Havilland Vampires until 1955. The wing had been on garrison duty in Malta since July 1952, and Newham was one of five Korean War veterans who replaced pilots posted back to Australia. He married Jo Cranston in 1956; the couple had two daughters and a son. By November 1957, Newham had been promoted to flight lieutenant and was undergoing <b>conversion</b> <b>training</b> on the CAC Sabre. From 1958 to 1960 he served in Malaya with No. 3 Squadron, whose Sabres conducted operations against communist guerrillas in {{the final years of}} the Malayan Emergency.|$|E

5|$|In October 2008 it was {{announced}} that Prince Harry had begun the process of qualifying to become an Apache pilot. In May 2010, the terrorist organisation Al Qaeda threatened to abduct the prince if he piloted an Apache in Afghanistan. In April 2011, Prince Harry was promoted to captain following his completion of Apache <b>conversion</b> <b>training.</b> In June 2011, sections of the media reported that Prince Harry was to deploy to Afghanistan as an Apache pilot in 2012. He subsequently deployed to Afghanistan as part of 662 Squadron in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its pilot training responsibilities, No.79 Squadron's Operations Flight provides aircraft to support Navy and Army training exercises. These duties are undertaken by experienced pilots who did not successfully complete operational <b>conversion</b> <b>training,</b> and also by new pilots who have completed training with No.76 Squadron and been posted back to No.79 Squadron until a place becomes available in an operational conversion course. No.76 Squadron has a similar Operations Flight. Most of No. 79 Squadron's exercises with the Navy take place {{off the coast of}} Western Australia, but aircraft are occasionally deployed to Darwin for this task.|$|E
5|$|In early 1994, {{the initial}} batch of US-built {{aircraft}} arrived at MCAS Cherry Point for pilot <b>conversion</b> <b>training.</b> The first Italian-assembled Harrier was rolled out the following year. In mid-January 1995, Giuseppe Garibaldi set off from Taranto to Somalia with three Harriers on board to maintain stability following {{the withdrawal of}} UN forces. The Harriers, flown by five Italian pilots, accumulated more than 100 flight hours and achieved 100 percent availability during the three-month deployment, performing reconnaissance and other missions. The squadron returned to port on 22 March.|$|E

5|$|JAL Flight Academy (JFA) was {{established}} by Japan Airlines (JAL) in August 1989, as a flight training school subsidiary based at Omura Airport, Nagasaki. It provided <b>conversion</b> <b>training</b> for its flight engineers to become pilots. In April 1991, a new division of JFA was created to operate scheduled services to succeed the troubled Nishi Seto Airlink services, a commuter airline serving cities in western Japan. Since {{the introduction of the}} 19-seats Jetstream 31s (JS31) in September 1991, the aircraft progressively replaced the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante inherited from Nishi Seto.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{convened a}} meeting on 29 November 1946 to settle the future policy on jet fighters for the VVS and PVO. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 was {{selected}} as the primary fighter with the Yakovlev Yak-15 relegated to <b>conversion</b> <b>training</b> and familiarization. The imminent availability of British jet engines and access to German jet technology and engineers meant that there was no longer any need for mixed-power aircraft, but Stalin insisted that the I-250 finish its trials and that the tooling and drawings should be retained along with unassembled parts even though the program was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Two {{training}} units also operated the Vengeance. No. 2 Operational Training Unit received {{several of the}} type in 1942. On 1 October 1942, No. 4 Operational Training Unit (No. 4 OTU) was formed at RAAF Station Williamtown to train aircrews to operate the Vengeance in combat. The unit began its first operational <b>conversion</b> <b>training</b> course on 28 October that year. No. 4 OTU's fleet of Vengeances was augmented with several Wirraways in January 1943; from this time crews began their training on the simple-to-operate Wirraway before progressing onto the Vengeance. Two of the dive bombers were destroyed in flying accidents during August and September 1943, resulting {{in the deaths of}} their crews.|$|E

5|$|As the VPAF {{pilots were}} {{completing}} the final phases of their <b>conversion</b> <b>training,</b> the VPAF Command chose to attack Tan Son Nhut Air Base in Saigon. On {{the afternoon of}} April 27, the pilots were flown out to Phù Cát Air Base in Bình Định Province where Major-General Le Van Tri, commander of the VPAF, briefed them on the upcoming operation. Tri also instructed the pilots {{to ensure that their}} bombs should not hit civilian areas in Saigon. From the original group of trainees, Luc, De, Quang, Vuong, Trung and On were selected {{to take part in the}} attack. Meanwhile, On and Xanh were also instructed to test-fly five captured A-37 bombers, which would be the mainstay of the Quyet Thang Squadron. On the morning of April 28, the Quyet Thang Squadron became operational with Luc as the squadron's commander, when it was transferred to Phan Rang Air Base.|$|E
5|$|In May German forces {{attacked}} the Netherlands and Belgium which fell quickly. In June France collapsed. Fighter Command now needed {{an influx of}} pilots after losses in Western Europe. Finucane had improved and on 27 June 1940 he was posted to 7 Operational Training Unit (7 OTU) in Hawarden near Chester, to undergo <b>conversion</b> <b>training</b> onto Supermarine Spitfires while awaiting a fighter squadron posting. Finucane made his first flight in a Spitfire on 3 July 1940 and made 26 such flights in nine days. The pilots were tested on radio transmission, handling, formation flying and aerobatics. On 11 July 1940 he was permitted just one firing practice. At {{the end of his}} stay at 7 OTU he had logged 2 hours 40 minutes on the Magister, 2 hours 25 minutes on the Fairey Battle, 15 minutes on the Hawker Hurricane and 22 hours and 20 minutes on the Spitfire.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1939 No.4 Squadron, {{which was}} located at RAAF Station Richmond in the {{outskirts}} of Sydney and equipped with Avro Anson patrol aircraft, was redesignated No.6 Squadron. No.4 Squadron had been responsible for conducting reconnaissance patrols along Australia's east coast as well as undertaking training exercises with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). These duties continued after the squadron was re-designated, and early in 1939 it gained the additional role of providing <b>conversion</b> <b>training</b> on the Anson for new pilots and air gunners. The squadron's maritime patrol activities were hindered by the limitations of its Ansons; these aircraft were obsolete and had an inadequate range and bomb load. On 28 April 1939, an Anson of No. 6 Squadron crashed near Riverstone, killing all four crew members.|$|E

5|$|On April 19, the VPAF Command {{was ordered}} to prepare for an {{operation}} in South Vietnam, so a group of pilots from the 4th Squadron of the VPAF 923rd Fighter Regiment was selected to undertake <b>conversion</b> <b>training</b> in Da Nang and form a new squadron for the operation. The selected group was led by Upper Captain Nguyen Van Luc along with Tu De, Tran Cao Thang, Han Van Quang and Hoang Mai Vuong. Together with former Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots Trung and On, the group would form the Quyet Thang ("Determined to Win") Squadron. On April 22 the VPAF pilots arrived at Da Nang Air Base and they began training on two A-37 aircraft that were restored to flying condition with support from Trung, On, Xanh and a few captured South Vietnamese technicians. In just five days, the VPAF pilots were able to independently fly the A-37 without support from the former Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots.|$|E
5|$|By late 1942, {{training}} became sufficient {{in quality}} {{and the number of}} crews increased. For example, No. 17 Group RAF produced 238 trained crews in August 1943, using the 1,007 aircraft available. During that year, 1,863 crews totalling some 11,482 men, were trained on 14 different types of aircraft in 255,800 hours. A combination of changed requirements and the formation of more specialist and advanced training overseas reduced the need for further expansion in 1944. The figures in 1943 proved to be the highest annual out put of trained crews in wartime. With sufficient manpower now available, four OTUs were closed in 1944. By July 1944 the 26 syllabuses increased to 38 and the course hours increased to 12 weeks and 87 hours. A/S training was soon set in two stages; <b>conversion</b> <b>training</b> taking five to six weeks and 32 day and night flying training and then an operational phase, in which another 55 hours and 30 sorties were flown in five weeks. This phase included ten flights on radar and gunnery training.|$|E
5|$|Philipp was {{transferred}} to the I. Gruppe of Kampfgeschwader 253 (I./KG253—1st group of the 253rd Bomber Wing) on 1 March 1938. This assignment did not suit Philipp, and on 1 May 1938 he managed to get himself transferred to the Jagdfliegerschule Werneuchen (fighter pilot school) in Werneuchen, then under the command of Oberst (Colonel) Theodor Osterkamp. The Anschluß, the 1938 occupation and annexation of Austria into the German Reich, spawned the rapid expansion of the Luftwaffe. Philipp's fighter pilot career benefited from this expansion and he {{was transferred}} to the I./Jagdgeschwader 138 (I./JG138—1st group of the 138th Fighter Wing) stationed in Wien-Schwechat on 1 July 1938. Here he underwent flight <b>conversion</b> <b>training</b> from the Heinkel He 51 biplane to the then modern Messerschmitt Bf 109. This posed challenges, and on 21 June and again 19 July 1939, he damaged his Bf109 during takeoff and landing. In 1939, Philipp bought a DKW Meisterklasse automobile. With this car he went on a tour through Italy where he met his future fiancée Katharina Egger from South Tyrol. On 1 May 1939, his unit I./JG138 was re-designated I./Jagdgeschwader 76 (I./JG76—1st group of the 76th Fighter Wing).|$|E
50|$|The railway {{line from}} Walburg to the Großalmerode Ost end-of-line station was opened on 15 December 1915. Passenger service was ended on 2 June 1973. After <b>conversion,</b> the <b>trains</b> ran farther along the Gelstertalbahn to Witzenhausen Süd and Eichenberg.|$|R
50|$|The task of <b>conversion</b> and <b>training</b> {{took over}} a year, but by July 1944 it was completed. The {{battalion}} was transferred to Finschhafen, New Guinea, where it was reorganized as a Ranger battalion and redesignated as the 6th Ranger Battalion.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>conversion,</b> the <b>train</b> was repainted into a livery {{consisting}} of light blue upper body and dark blue lower body {{separated by a}} thin white stripe. This livery was based on that applied to the line's former Yu 101 open-sided special-event car nicknamed Miotsukushi.|$|R
5|$|The {{specialised}} {{training was}} conducted from several schools. Anti-submarine training was provided from the Combined Anti-Submarine Training Centre at Maydown, beginning in May 1943. Air-Sea rescue schools {{were set up}} at Blackpool, equipped with Avro Ansons. Conversion units, such as No. 6 OTU, was detailed to provide <b>conversion</b> <b>training</b> for crews, who were to fly the Consolidated Liberator, Boeing Fortress and Handley Page Halifax. Training still remained below what was needed, owing to manpower requirements on the front line. It was not until October 1944, that it became widely accepted to give crews refresher training on new types of aircraft, that this practice became policy. Even so, one conversion course {{was all that was}} afforded to any crew. Increasing the training hours from 72 to 87 helped in some respects. Also, by 1945, it had become standard practice for Squadron Leaders to visit and help the OTUs keep pace with changes operational difficulties, by reporting back to the schools on how best the OTU establishment could serve the needs of Squadrons, through training or otherwise.|$|E
5|$|To prepare aircrew {{for their}} {{rotation}} through No.2 Squadron in Vietnam, No.1OCU {{students participated in}} exercises such as Combat Skyspot in August 1968, which utilised radar controlled by No.30 Squadron, and Strait Kris in September–October 1969, {{in conjunction with the}} Australian Army. The unit lost two more aircrew when a Canberra M.21 on a training flight crashed near Amberley on 23March 1970. From 21March to 25April 1971, four of the unit's aircraft flew 10,000 miles around Australia to conduct seven flying displays as part of the RAAF's Golden Jubilee celebrations. Having completed thirty-six conversion courses in its twelve years of operation, No.1OCU was disbanded on 9June 1971, following the withdrawal of No.2 Squadron from Vietnam. Unit staff were transferred to No.2 Squadron, which continued to operate the Canberra and carry out its own operational conversion until disbanding in June 1982. Ten of No.1 OCU's fifteen Canberras were put into storage and the remainder, including surviving Mk.21 trainers, were taken on by No.2 Squadron. When the F-111C eventually entered service with No.82 Wing in 1973, No.6 Squadron again took responsibility for <b>conversion</b> <b>training,</b> while No.1 Squadron acted as the lead strike unit. Canberra A84-236, which was allocated to No.1OCU in 1968 and 1970 when not in service with No.2 Squadron in Vietnam, went on display at RAAF Museum, Point Cook, Victoria, in 1982.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron {{moved from}} Richmond to RAAF Base Amberley, west of Brisbane, in October 1992. At {{this time the}} {{squadron}} continued {{to be responsible for}} all Caribou <b>conversion</b> <b>training,</b> as well as conducting tactical transport operations. The permanent detachment of No. 38 Squadron aircraft to RAAF Base Pearce ceased in 1999, and Detachment B of the squadron was established at RAAF Base Townsville in North Queensland during 2000. From 1999 until early 2001, elements of No. 38 Squadron, designated No. 86 Wing Detachment C, were stationed in East Timor and supported the international peacekeeping force which had been deployed there to end the violence that had broken out following a successful referendum on independence conducted in August 1999. At its peak strength, four Caribous were assigned to the detachment. The air and ground crew deployed to East Timor endured difficult living conditions until their accommodation and recreation facilities were upgraded in mid-2000, and the pilots were regularly required to fly into poorly maintained air strips. Despite the age of the Caribous and shortages of spare parts, Detachment C's ground crew managed to maintain a high aircraft serviceability rate. In 2000 No. 35 Squadron was deactivated, leaving No. 38 Squadron the RAAF's sole Caribou operator. By September 2002, No. 38 Squadron was equipped with 14 Caribous. In July 2003, two aircraft were deployed to the Solomon Islands as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands peacekeeping force. Both Caribous were based at Honiara International Airport, and a detachment remained in the country until July 2004. All of No. 38 Squadron moved to RAAF Base Townsville during 2008.|$|E
