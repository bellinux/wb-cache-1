40|$|A 12 kHz Bottom Sediment Classification (BSC) {{system that}} characterizes the sea-bottom {{according}} to acoustic impedance estimates was used to obtain normal incident acoustic data for determination of bottom sediment composition in Southeast Pass Louisiana, {{near the mouth of}} the Mississippi River, and in an area offshore Corpus Christi Texas.

30|$|It may be {{observed}} that for large scribble coverage, three investigated methods deliver very similar outcome (top {{row in the}} Figures), and the differences are hardly visible, which is confirmed by the quantitative results. However, for smaller coverage, the images obtained using these methods differ significantly. It may be seen that both visually and quantitatively FIVC method is the most sensitive to the scribble coverage and it fails <b>to</b> <b>colorize</b> the images correctly for fewer scribbles. Competitive image colorization has higher stability, making it possible <b>to</b> <b>colorize</b> the image based on medium scribble coverage. However, {{it is only the}} proposed boosting technique which is very little dependent on the density and precision of the scribbles. Here, the colorized images are almost identical regardless of the scribble coverage, as it {{can be seen in the}} rightmost column in the Figures. Also, the similarity scores (highlighted in the tables) are very high between these images.

40|$|Background: Contrast {{echocardiography}} {{may be used}} {{to assess}} myocardial perfusion. However, gray scale assessment of myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is difficult because of variations in regional backscatter intensity, difficulties in distinguishing varying shades of gray, and artifacts or attenuation. We sought to determine whether the assessment of rest myocardial perfusion by MCE could be improved with subtraction and color coding. Methods and results: MCE was performed in 31 patients with previous myocardial infarction with a 2 (nd) generation agent (NC 100100, Nycomed AS), using harmonic triggered or continuous imaging and gain settings were kept constant throughout the study. Digitized images were post processed by subtraction of baseline from contrast data and <b>colorized</b> <b>to</b> reflect the intensity of myocardial contrast. Gray scale MCE alone, MCE images combined with baseline and subtracted colorized images were scored independently using a 16 segment model. The presence and severity of myocardial contrast abnormalities were compared with perfusion defined by rest MIBI-SPECT. Segments that were not visualized by continuous (17 %) or triggered imaging (14 %) after color processing were excluded from further analysis. The specificity of gray scale MCE alone (56 %) or MCE combined with baseline 2 D (47 %) was significantly enhanced by subtraction and color coding (76 %,...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{difficult}} problem of video colorization. Methods in the literature are generally based on spatio-temporal video blocks, or on frame to frame color propagation methods, each technique having its own advantages and drawbacks. In this paper, we present both a novel automatic frame-to-frame propagation approach and an interactive correction method within a variational framework. The proposed method propagates colors from an initial <b>colorized</b> frame <b>to</b> the whole grayscale video sequence. The automatic propagation results may be visually unsuitable in some cases. To overcome this limitation, a spatio-temporal functional with a user-guided correction is introduced. Two primal-dual algorithms are designed to solve the proposed variational models. Numerical results show the efficiency and the potentiality of the proposed approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a new method <b>to</b> <b>colorize</b> gray-scale images. While the reverse operation {{is only a}} matter of standard, the colorization process is an ill-posed problem that requires some priors. In the literature two classes of approach exist. The first class includes manual methods that needs the user to manually add colors on the image <b>to</b> <b>colorize.</b> The second class includes exemplar-based approaches where a color image, with a similar semantic content, is provided as input to the method. These two types of priors have their own advantages and drawbacks. In this paper, a new variational framework for exemplar-based colorization is proposed. A non-local approach is used to find relevant color in the source image in order to suggest colors on the gray-scale image. The spatial coherency of the result as well as the final color selection is provided by a non-convex variational framework based on a total variation. An efficient primal-dual algorithm is provided and a proof of its convergence is proposed. In this work, we also extend the proposed exemplar-based approach to combine both exemplar-based and manual methods. It {{provides a}} single framework that unifies advantages of both approaches. Finally, experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods illustrate the efficiency of our method...|$|R
