Modelling the <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> is the main topic dealt with in this article. Recent developments in market demands, technology and structuring and redesign of logistic processes are also described. It is concluded that Operations Research models and techniques are well suited to analyse the local performance of logistic sub-chains and processes. But, in order to fully support the analysis of the performance of an integrated <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> the traditional Operations Research approach, in which the OR model is the starting point of the analysis and in which the data structure is derived from the model, is insufficient. In integrated <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> modelling the choice of suitable OR models should be determined by the information structure required and by the information technology available. To improve the performance of the total <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> an experimental environment is needed, including a set of OR models and having the capability to easily and quickly build these logistic models. We call this environment a logistic laboratory. To illustrate this concept two logistic laboratories, developed in cooperation with the authors, are describe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{about the role of}} freight {{forwarders}} in managing international <b>logistic</b> <b>chains,</b> where they are often seen as their 'architects'. But they are in danger of being by-passed or disintermediated, due to organisational and/or technological reasons. First, a need for an integrated approach to <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> has been already recognised in theory and prac-tice. Multinational firms in the industry or retail sector i. e. show an increasing demand for complex transport and logistic service like world-wide door-to-door delivery or one-stop-shopping. Second, the employment of new technologies in connection with the Internet cause a deep change in the relationships along the <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> due to a change in inter-mediation. This will be reflected by developing a theoretical framework based on Casson's theory of entrepreneurial networks in international business to provide some insight in the complex relationships between shippers, freight forwarders and other intermediaries or ser-vice providers along the international <b>logistic</b> <b>chain.</b> Key Words: freight forwarder; international logistic chain; entrepreneurial networ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> {{has evolved}} from being a concept of {{integrated}} transport activity {{to that of a}} fully functioning, dynamic, and complex multi-component system with the primary function of delivering effective management of freight mobility. Whilst humanity is faced with the challenge of reducing the impact of transport on the environment without losing the benefits to society and economies, a holistic approach to the environmental management of the <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> emerges as a necessity. The thesis follows a multi-method and interdisciplinary, phased pathway in order to (1) assess the feasibility and practicability of delivering sustainable development through such a chain, (2) address the challenges inherent to its implementation, and (3) develop a model that guides the development and delivery of an environmental management system specifically focussed on the <b>logistic</b> <b>chain.</b> Following an environmental management based methodology, the significant environmental aspects of the <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> operations are identified and analysed. Focus is then placed on the major players in the chain (transport buyers, providers and operators) and, in particular, on selected practices that have the potential to improve chain environmental performance and guide the future trends of the sector's response. Seaports are selected for purposes of evaluation and validation of various options as they arguably represent the major and most complex of the logistic nodes in terms of intense intermodal and multi-actor interest. The evolution and trends in the field of integrated seaport area management are evaluated by specifically designed surveys and case studies. Similarly, noise is selected as a multi-source, trans-boundary and complex issue in order to examine the potential options for control of significant environmental aspects of the <b>logistic</b> <b>chain.</b> The feasibility of integrated noise management throughout the chain is assessed through the demonstration of available management response options. The results and the major observations are finally synthesised in order to propose a generic model suitable for addressing the challenges of integrated environmental management of the <b>logistic</b> <b>chain...</b>|$|R

40|$|In an ever-changing {{world where}} {{economic}} growth is inter-alia dependent on the export of bulk minerals, the risk and the severity of risk incidences in the bulk mineral supply chain should be minimised. In South Africa the export of coal is a large contributor to the GDP and any risk to this supply chain will directly affect its contribution to the GDP. Although all the stakeholders in the bulk coal export <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> manage the risk in their own domain, the bulk export <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> represents a supply chain structure where the risk of one stakeholder influences the risk of another stakeholder. Therefore, to reduce the total risk, an integrated risk management framework for the bulk coal export <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> is required. This study investigated the risks and the risk management processes in the bulk coal export supply <b>chain.</b> This <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> was chosen based on the monetary value the chain represents and the contribution to the GDP. A qualitative research design was used with one-on-one interviews and content analysis of risk management policies and procedures to obtain the data.

40|$|We {{first tried}} {{to monitor the}} {{critical}} points for eggshell breakage in different <b>logistic</b> <b>chains.</b> Second, we examined {{whether there was a}} difference in eggshell strength among eggs produced in different housing systems. Finally, we developed a model to investigate the relation between eggshell strength and the likelihood of an egg cracking during handling and grading. Four <b>logistic</b> <b>chains</b> with different housing systems (battery cages, furnished cages, aviary, and free-range), all housing Bovans Goldline chickens in their mid-lay (45 wk), were compared. In every chain, a randomized set of 1, 500 eggs was sampled, and the strength was defined. At every critical point in every <b>logistic</b> <b>chain,</b> the eggs were reexamined for breakage. The classic and furnished cage systems showed the highest percentage of breakage directly at point of lay (6. 73 and 10. 72 %), whereas the other systems showed lower breakage (1. 94 % in the aviary and 1. 99 % in the free-range system). Further, in the <b>logistic</b> <b>chain,</b> grading and packing of the eggs generated the second highest percentage of breakage (from 1. 50 to 2. 65 %). Breakage due to transportation ranged from 0. 16 to 2. 65 %. There was a significant difference among the eggshell strength (shell stiffness and damping ratio) of eggs from chickens in different housing systems, showing eggs from chickens in the aviary system to be stronger than cage eggs (classic and furnished) and free-range eggs to be weaker than the other eggs. A significant correlation was found between eggshell strength and the likelihood of breakage in the production chains. In conclusion, it was first shown that, besides the laying, packing of the eggs is a critical point in the <b>logistic</b> <b>chain</b> of consumption eggs; second, the strength of the eggs in the different housing systems differed, and, finally, the eggshell stiffness and damping ratio of consumption eggs are an acceptable measure for rapid eggshell quality assessment and could provide a good predictive value for eggshell breakage in all types of table egg production chains. status: publishe...|$|R

Background: The {{economics}} globalization leaded to {{the growth}} of the number of international and global supply chains, possessing potentially vulnerable places due to the reason of their high duration and existence of cultural and other barriers between the participants of supply chains.
