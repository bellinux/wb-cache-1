40|$|THIS paper {{reports a}} limited {{series of tests}} for {{carcinogenic}} action on mouse skin of tar obtained from cigarette smoke. Since the evidence that cigarette tars are carcinogenic has come from only one group in one country it seems desirable that results of other workers should be presented {{as soon as possible}} so that the position can be better evaluated. The experiments described here failed to reveal any carcinogenic action under the conditions of the test. MATERIALS AND METHODS Tar production Standard size cigarettes of British manufacture were smoked in batches of 20 in an all-glass apparatus. An alternating suction was applied so that air was drawn through the cigarettes for 11 - 2 seconds every 25 seconds. This was effected by placing in the suction train a glass tap which was rotated slowly by a low speed electric motor. The smoke was drawn through four traps containing acetone, the first two chilled in a solid carbon dioxide-acetone mixture, the remaining two at room temperature. The bulk of the tarry material was removed by the first two traps and no smoke was observed to pass the fourth trap. The contents of the traps were pooled and the acetone was distilled off to obtain the <b>crude</b> <b>tar.</b> This was stored in a refrigerator and was solid under these conditions (about 30 C.). From each 1000 cigarettes 30 - 35 g. of tar were obtained. The temperature of smoking in the machine was determined using a chromelalumel thermocouple and found to be comparable with that during smoking by mouth. The hottest point in the centre of the burning zone was found in both cases to be about 7800 C., falling to 6400 C. at the outer rim of the cigarette. Hence variable temperatures of smoking might be reported if the location of the thermocouple, with respect to the centre of the cross-section of the cigarette, i...|$|E
