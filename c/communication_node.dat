The city thus became the seat of the {{prefecture}} of Pô department until the fall of Napoleon in 1814, when the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia was restored with Turin as its capital. In the following decades, the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia led the struggle towards the unification of Italy. In 1861, Turin became the capital of the newly proclaimed united Kingdom of Italy until 1865, when the capital was moved to Florence, and then to Rome after the 1870 conquest of the Papal States. The 1871 opening of the Fréjus Tunnel made Turin an important <b>communication</b> <b>node</b> between Italy and France. The city in that period had 250,000 inhabitants. Some of the most iconic landmarks of the city, like the Mole Antonelliana, the Egyptian Museum, the Gran Madre di Dio church and Piazza Vittorio Veneto were built in this period. The late 19th century was also a period of rapid industrialization, especially in the automotive sector: in 1899 Fiat was established in the city, followed by Lancia in 1906. The Universal Exposition held in Turin in 1902 is often regarded as the pinnacle of Art Nouveau design, and the city hosted the same event in 1911.

40|$|Multi-way {{relaying}} is {{a widely}} considered network configuration, where multiple <b>communication</b> <b>nodes</b> exchange their information via a single relay.

In the proposed joint decoding algorithm, the soft information of the information bits is exchanged between the channel decoders corresponding to different node pairs transmitting simultaneously. We also propose three different schemes for soft information exchange between the different channel decoders. The proposed algorithm is highly scalable with respect to the number of <b>communication</b> <b>nodes.</b> Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed joint decoding algorithm offers improved error performance over the existing joint decoding algorithms for a three-way relay system under the three different information exchanging schemes.

40|$|The {{connectivity}} of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANets) can {{be affected}} by the special distribution patterns, usually dependent and non-uniform, of vehicles in a transportation network. In this study, we introduce a new framework for computing the connectivity in a VANet for continuous distribution patterns of <b>communication</b> <b>nodes</b> on a line in a transportation network. Such distribution patterns can be estimated from traffic densities obtained through loop detectors or other detectors. When <b>communication</b> <b>nodes</b> follow homogeneous Poisson distributions, we obtain a new closed-form solution to connectivity; when distribution patterns of <b>communication</b> <b>nodes</b> are given by spatial renewal processes, we derive an approximate closedform solution to the connectivity; and when <b>communication</b> <b>nodes</b> follow non-homogeneous Poisson distributions, we propose a recursive model of connectivity. For a shock-wave traffic, we demonstrate the consistency between analytical results with those simulated with ns- 2, acommunication simulator. With the developed models, we also discuss the impacts on connectivity of road-side stations and different distribution patterns of vehicles. Given continuous traffic conditions, the connectivity model could be helpful for designing routing protocols in VANets and implementing vehicle-infrastructure integration systems.
