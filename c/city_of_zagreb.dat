5|$|Since the {{counties}} were re-established in 1992, Croatia {{is divided into}} 20 counties and the capital <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Zagreb,</b> the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time. Borders of {{the counties}} changed in some instances since, with the latest revision taking place in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities. Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) division of Croatia is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit, while there are three NUTS 2 regions. Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia and Adriatic Croatia. The latter encompasses all the counties along the Adriatic coast. The Northwest Croatia includes the <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Zagreb,</b> Zagreb, Krapina-Zagorje, Varaždin, Koprivnica-Križevci and Međimurje counties, and the Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areas—Bjelovar-Bilogora, Virovitica-Podravina, Požega-Slavonia, Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Syrmia, Karlovac and Sisak-Moslavina counties. Individual counties and the <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Zagreb</b> also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS Local administrative unit divisions are two-tiered. LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Zagreb</b> in effect making those the same as NUTS 3 units, while LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to the cities and municipalities of Croatia.|$|E

5|$|In September 2006, the Government of Croatia {{formed a}} {{construction}} workgroup. It {{was decided that}} the project, estimated at the time at HRK 173 million (US$ 30 million), would be partially financed by the Government of Croatia and the <b>City</b> <b>of</b> <b>Zagreb,</b> and that both Jewish organizations should be represented in the workgroup. However, the involvement of Bet Israel was deemed unacceptable by the Jewish Community of Zagreb, which is the sole owner of the Praška Street property, and which also sees itself as the sole legal representative of the Zagreb Jewish community. As a consequence, the community and its president, Ognjen Kraus, refused further participation in the project under the set conditions.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Jewish Community of Zagreb {{sought to}} legally reacquire its property. The Croatian denationalization law was enacted in 1996, and the Praška Street parcel was finally {{returned}} to the community on December 31, 1999. By 2000, reconstruction activities were invigorated again. An investment study was submitted to the Government of Croatia and the <b>City</b> <b>of</b> <b>Zagreb</b> in July 2004 and revised in October 2004. The architecture competition was planned for 2005. However, a 2005 rift in the Jewish Community of Zagreb resulted in formation of a splinter Jewish community, Bet Israel, led by Ivo and Slavko Goldstein.|$|E
5|$|Operation Labrador was a false flag {{operation}} {{carried out}} by the Yugoslav Air Force's Counterintelligence Service (KOS) in the Croatian capital <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Zagreb</b> during {{the early stages of the}} Croatian War of Independence.

Two bombings were carried out on 19 August 1991, with one at the Jewish Community Centre and a second near Jewish graves at the Mirogoj Cemetery; there were no casualties. Additional attacks targeted the national railway network and were designed to implicate the Croatian President. Operation Labrador was complemented by Operation Opera — a propaganda campaign devised by the KOS to feed disinformation to the media.|$|E

5|$|The {{ecological}} footprint of Croatia's population and industry varies significantly between the country's regions since 50% {{of the population}} resides in 26.8% of the nation's territory, with a particularly high impact made by the <b>city</b> <b>of</b> <b>Zagreb</b> and Zagreb County areas—their combined area comprises 6.6% of Croatia's territory while encompassing 25% of the population. The {{ecological footprint}} is most notably from the increased development of settlements and the sea coast leading to habitat fragmentation. Between 1998 and 2008, the greatest changes of land use pertained to artificially developed areas, but the scale of development is negligible compared to EU member states.|$|E
