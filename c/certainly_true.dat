25|$|However, this is {{certainly}} not entirely true. Gerard cannot have spent much, if any time in prison, as he was appointed permanent counsel by the City of London in October 1554, and represented Wigan in the English parliament {{for the third time}} in 1555. Nor can he have incurred the wrath of Mary, as he was made a Serjeant-at-law, one of a small and extremely powerful group of barristers with exclusive rights to work in the Court of Common Pleas towards the end of her reign - an appointment that lapsed on her death. He was made Justice of the Peace in five counties by 1559, many of them probably in Mary's reign: Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire and Huntingdonshire.

[...] McBurney traces this to the avant-garde artistic circles of the early Soviet period in which Shostakovich moved early in his career, and argues that these borrowings were a deliberate technique {{to allow him to}} create [...] "patterns of contrast, repetition, exaggeration" [...] that gave his music the large-scale structure it required.|$|E

As Phillips notes, [...] "no documents, no diaries, no {{confidential}} letters to Mark Hanna (or anyone else) contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems." [...] From the beginning, McKinley's preparations had the participation of Hanna, whose biographer William T. Horner noted, [...] "what is <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> is that in 1888 the two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put McKinley in the White House." [...] Sherman did not run for president again after 1888, and so Hanna could support McKinley's ambitions for that office wholeheartedly.|$|E

The Complete X-Files notes that the [...] "chess motif" [...] was carried on throughout the episode, most notably in the fact that The Smoking Man [...] "plays Mulder to a checkmate, using Jeffrey as a pawn." [...] Because of this, and his past actions, many perceived The Smoking Man as the true villain of the story. William B. Davis, who played The Smoking Man, however, felt that the character was the hero of the story. He noted, [...] "I used to go to conventions and try to convince everyone that I was the hero of the series and Mulder was the bad guy.

500|$|Many of {{the junior}} {{officers}} in the flank parties had difficulty stopping their exhausted, enraged men from killing everyone they found inside these buildings. For example, two innocent drunks who refused {{to hide in the}} basement of a tavern in Menotomy were killed only because they were suspected of being involved with the day's events. Although many of the accounts of ransacking and burnings were exaggerated later by the colonists for propaganda value (and to get financial compensation from the colonial government), it is <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that taverns along the road were ransacked and the liquor stolen by the troops, who in some cases became drunk themselves. [...] One church's communion silver was stolen but was later recovered after it was sold in Boston. [...] Aged Menotomy resident Samuel Whittemore killed three regulars before he was attacked by a British contingent and left for dead. [...] (He recovered from his wounds and later died in 1793 at age 98.) [...] All told, far more blood was shed in Menotomy and Cambridge than elsewhere that day. The colonists lost 25 men killed and nine wounded there, and the British lost 40 killed and 80 wounded, with the 47th Foot and the Marines suffering the highest casualties.

500|$|Marochetti was {{not popular}} with the Victorian artistic establishment; Punch {{referred}} to him derisively as [...] "Count Marrowfatty", while John Timbs wrote that he [...] "owed more of his success in life to royal and noble patrons than artistic merit." [...] It was <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that he benefited from the patronage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. His courtly manners impressed Victoria on their first meeting in 1849, and soon afterwards he became involved with the Prince Consort's plans for what became The Great Exhibition of 1851. Several countries planned to display sculptures of romantic historical figures in {{their contributions to the}} exhibition. The genre was common in mainland Europe but relatively rare in England at the time. Marochetti was probably aware that the Belgian sculptor Eugene Simonis intended to show his statue of Godfrey de Bouillon, the leader of the First Crusade, which King Leopold I of Belgium had commissioned. The two men had a number of connections; they shared the same bronze founder, Soyer of Paris, and Simonis was influenced by Marochetti's earlier acclaimed statue of the Duke of Savoy, Emanuele Filiberto. The Italian sculptor was probably motivated by a sense of competition with the Belgian in designing his RichardI.|$|E

2500|$|The {{scholarly}} {{literature is}} broadly {{divided on the}} question of whether or not Plato regarded the principles of the unwritten doctrines as <b>certainly</b> <b>true.</b> The Tübingen School attributes an epistemological optimism to Plato. This is especially emphasized by [...] Hans Krämer. His view is that Plato himself asserted the highest possible claim to certainty for knowledge of the truth of his unwritten doctrines. He calls Plato, at least in regard to his two principles, a 'dogmatist.' Other scholars and especially Rafael Ferber uphold the opposing view that for Plato the unwritten doctrines were advanced only as a hypothesis that could be wrong. Konrad Gaiser argues [...] that Plato formulated the unwritten doctrines as a coherent and complete philosophical system but not as a 'Summa of fixed dogmas preached in a doctrinaire way and announced as authoritative.' Instead, he continues, they were something for critical examination that could be improved: a model proposed for continuous, further development.|$|E

2500|$|Now {{that more}} {{is known about}} the trends in {{empirical}} measures of profitability, the debate focuses more on the underlying concepts. Simon Mohun states that the rate of profit is [...] "most easily measured as the proportion of net output not returned as wages to the aggregate fixed capital stock" [...] and that it is this rate of profit that is [...] "generally used in empirical work". If the growth of the gross profit component of value-added (P) is statistically compared with the growth of the estimated fixed capital stock plus inventory holdings (C), it is <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that almost all measures will show that the ratio P/C does drop over time. The real value of the physical capital stock appears to grow faster in real terms than the real value of the operating surplus associated with that physical stock, in the long run. The same effect persists even when various different depreciation techniques are used. The data trend is analogous to a rising tendency of the capital coefficient, where in the course of time more and more capital is required to obtain each additional increase in output. The profit rate rises again, only after a major crisis or a war which destroys a sufficiently large amount of capital value, raises the rate of surplus value, and clears the way for new production techniques.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} Ba Zaw’s early {{training}} as a painter is a patchwork of contradictory claims. For example, Ludu Daw Amar and Ko Ko Naing describe Ba Zaw as self-taught and maintain that he learned painting by studying from books. Min Naing, on the other hand, mentions that the doyen of Traditional painting in Burma {{at the turn of}} the century, Saya Chone (18661917), was an instructor of Ba Zaw while Ba Zaw taught at St. Paul’s High School and offers convincing details about their interaction. Nyan Shein claims that Ba Ohn (c. 1877 [...] fl. 1924) was one of Ba Zaw’s teachers, and Ko Ko Naing acknowledges the influence that the three early British chairmen and teachers of the Burma Art Club (BAC)—Martin Ward, Martin Jones, and E.G.N. Kinch—had on Ba Zaw, which is almost <b>certainly</b> <b>true.</b> The BAC was informally organized in 1913 as a venue where amateur British colonial painters in Burma might meet and exchange skills, and became more officially established in 1918. Toward the later date, the BAC began to train Burmese painters. Ba Zaw was one of the earliest Burmese members of the club, and he picked up much from its lectures. Ko Ko Naing and Amar’s claim that Ba Zaw was self-taught is accurate in the sense that Ba Zaw was self-taught to a degree. He won scholarships or painting competitions when he was a youngster before he encountered Ba Ohn, Saya Chone or British painters.|$|E
