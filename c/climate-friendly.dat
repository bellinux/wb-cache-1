The scenarios describe the consequences of different degrees of GHG emission constraint, at world level, but also for a case where Europe adopts an ambitious climate policy, {{while the rest of the}} world sticks to much more modest abatement policies. The analysis shows that under such stringent climate policies, Europe may benefit of a significant double dividend, first in its capacity to develop a new cleaner and <b>climate-friendlier</b> energy model, and second in a lower vulnerability to potential price or supply shocks on the international energy markets...|$|R
40|$|The {{controversial}} {{practice of}} ‘fracking’ as {{practiced in the}} US has offered the promise of energy independence, a <b>climate-friendlier</b> ‘bridge’ to renewable energy than coal, and a much needed economic boost. At the same time, fracking is linked with widespread water and air pollution, increased incidence of earthquakes, split communities and drastically altered landscapes. How has the proposed introduction of fracking in the UK fared {{in light of these}} concerns? What role has science played in the battle for public opinion fought by the shale industry and its opponents? This chapter examines efforts by the shale industry to ‘win hearts and minds’, including the use of intensive public relations including academic funding and lobbying activities, and assesses their impact on media coverage of the controversy...|$|R
