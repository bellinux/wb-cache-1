6000|$|... "Good hunch!" [...] said Finkelstein, while {{even the}} learned Professor Pumphrey, a bulbous {{man with a}} pepper-and-salt cutaway and a pipe-organ voice, commented, [...] "That makes a dandy accessory. <b>Cigar-lighter</b> gives tone to the dashboard." ...|$|E
6000|$|Paul {{and he took}} up the spring-like {{quality of}} the spring, {{the virtues of the}} {{electric}} <b>cigar-lighter,</b> and the action of the New York State Assembly. It was not till Babbitt was thick and disconsolate with mutton grease that he flung out: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yeh, you're right they are! Had to have coupla {{blankets}} last night, {{out on the}} sleeping-porch. Say, Sid," [...] Babbitt {{turned to}} Finkelstein, the buyer, [...] "got something wanta ask you about. I {{went out and bought}} me an electric <b>cigar-lighter</b> for the car, this noon, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|A ragged {{little boy}} overheard her remark, and came running after her. [...] "Buy {{a box of}} <b>cigar-lights,</b> Miss!" [...] he pleaded, pulling her shawl to attract her attention. Clara stopped to explain.|$|R
60|$|And soon from {{street to}} street {{you hear the}} 'clarion' of the garrison, that {{singularly}} wild and sweet trumpet-call which sends French soldiers to their beds. And at that the whole populace swarms out, rich and poor, and listens entranced beneath {{the trees in the}} Place Maubourguet, as if they had never heard it before; with an order and a sobriety, and a good humour, and a bowing to each other, and asking and giving of <b>cigar-lights</b> between men of every class--and a little quiet modest love-making {{on the outskirts of the}} crowd, which is very pleasant to behold. And when the music is silent, and the people go off suddenly, silently, and soberly withal (for there are no drunkards in these parts), to their early beds, you stand and look up into the 'purple night,' as Homer calls it--that southern sky, intensely dark, and yet transparent withal, through which you seem to look beyond the stars into the infinite itself, and recollect that beyond all that, and through all that likewise, there is an infinite good God who cares for all these simple kindly folk; and that by Him all their hearts are as well known, and all their infirmities as mercifully weighed, as are, you trust, your own.|$|R
6000|$|On {{either side}} of the road, the barrows of the costermongers--the {{wandering}} tradesmen of the highway--were drawn up in rows; and every man was advertising his wares, by means of the cheap publicity of his own voice. Fish and vegetables; pottery and writing-paper; looking-glasses, saucepans, and coloured prints--all appealed together to the scantily filled purses of the crowds who thronged the pavement. One lusty vagabond stood up in a rickety donkey-cart, knee-deep in apples, selling a great wooden measure full for a penny, and yelling louder than all the rest. [...] "Never was such apples sold in the public streets before! Sweet as flowers, and sound as a bell. Who says the poor ain't looked after," [...] cried the fellow, with ferocious irony, [...] "when they can have such apple-sauce as this to their loin of pork? Here's nobby apples; here's a penn'orth for your money. Sold again! Hullo, you! you look hungry. Catch! there's an apple for nothing, just to taste. Be in time, be in time before they're all sold!" [...] Amelius moved forward a few steps, and was half deafened by rival butchers, shouting, [...] "Buy, buy, buy!" [...] to audiences of ragged women, who fingered the meat doubtfully, with longing eyes. A little farther--and there was a blind man selling staylaces, and singing a Psalm; and, beyond him again, a broken-down soldier playing [...] "God save the Queen" [...] on a tin flageolet. The one silent person in this sordid carnival was a Lascar beggar, with a printed placard round his neck, addressed to [...] "The Charitable Public." [...] He held a tallow candle to illuminate the copious narrative of his misfortunes; and the one reader he obtained was a fat man, who scratched his head, and remarked to Amelius that he didn't like foreigners. Starving boys and girls lurked among the costermongers' barrows, and begged piteously on pretence of selling <b>cigar-lights</b> and comic songs. Furious women stood at the doors of public-houses, and railed on their drunken husbands for spending the house-money in gin. A thicker crowd, towards the middle of the street, poured in and out at the door of a cookshop. Here the people presented a less terrible spectacle--they were even touching to see. These were the patient poor, who bought hot morsels of sheep's heart and liver at a penny an ounce, with lamentable little mouthfuls of peas-pudding, greens, and potatoes at a halfpenny each. Pale children in corners supped on penny basins of soup, and looked with hungry admiration at their enviable neighbours who could afford to buy stewed eels for twopence. Everywhere there was the same noble resignation to their hard fate, in old and young alike. No impatience, no complaints. In this wretched place, the language of true gratitude was still to be heard, thanking the good-natured cook for a little spoonful of gravy thrown in for nothing--and here, humble mercy that had its one superfluous halfpenny to spare gave that halfpenny to utter destitution, and gave it with right good-will. Amelius spent all his shillings and sixpences, in doubling and trebling the poor little pennyworths of food--and left the place with tears in his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|The roast of beef, roasted potatoes, {{and string}} beans were {{excellent}} this evening and, after an adequate {{sketch of the}} day's progressive weather-states, his four-hundred-and-fifty-dollar fee, his lunch with Paul Riesling, and the proven merits of the new <b>cigar-lighter,</b> he was moved to a benign, [...] "Sort o' thinking about buyin, a new car. Don't believe we'll get one till next year, but still we might." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{effect of}} his {{scientific}} budget-planning {{was that he}} felt at once triumphantly wealthy and perilously poor, {{and in the midst}} of these dissertations he stopped his car, rushed into a small news-and-miscellany shop, and bought the electric <b>cigar-lighter</b> which he had coveted for a week. He dodged his conscience by being jerky and noisy, and by shouting at the clerk, [...] "Guess this will prett' near pay for itself in matches, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|HE forgot Paul Riesling in an {{afternoon}} of not unagreeable details. After a return to his office, which seemed to have staggered on without him, he drove a [...] "prospect" [...] out to view a four-flat tenement in the Linton district. He {{was inspired by the}} customer's admiration of the new <b>cigar-lighter.</b> Thrice its novelty made him use it, and thrice he hurled half-smoked cigarettes from the car, protesting, [...] "I GOT to quit smoking so blame much!" ...|$|E
60|$|Their ample {{discussion}} of {{every detail of}} the <b>cigar-lighter</b> led them to speak of electric flat-irons and bed-warmers. Babbitt apologized for being so shabbily old-fashioned as still to use a hot-water bottle, and he announced that he would have the sleeping-porch wired at once. He had enormous and poetic admiration, though very little understanding, of all mechanical devices. They were his symbols of truth and beauty. Regarding each new intricate mechanism--metal lathe, two-jet carburetor, machine gun, oxyacetylene welder--he learned one good realistic-sounding phrase, and used it over and over, with a delightful feeling of being technical and initiated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{electrical}} <b>cigar-lighter</b> {{was invented}} and patented {{in the early}} 1880s by the German inventor [...] In the 1890s, these tools were sold as electrical cigar lighters (Cigarrenanzünder), and later as Zigarrenanzünder in the major German warehouse catalogues. Probably in the 1920s they were renamed [...] "cigarette lighters", as cigarettes overtook cigars in sales.|$|E
