5000|$|After this demolition, Fuller vowed the new theatre he {{was going}} to build would be the best in New Zealand. Fuller enlisted the help of Henry Eli White, who had already {{designed}} other theatres around the country for Fuller. White, fresh from building theatres in Timaru and Auckland, set out to plan the St. James. The St. James was the first entirely steel frame and reinforced concrete theatre in the world and plans made sure over 650 people could escape the auditorium {{in the event of a}} fire. Pillars in the auditorium were also kept at a minimum to allow perfect viewing, and seating was arranged in the arc of a circle to view the stage. The St. James was then adorned with marble pieces, carved face masks and cherubs to be placed on the ceiling and coloured glass. The plaster work was made by William Leslie Morrison, who reinforced the lime plaster with <b>cow</b> <b>hair.</b> Morrison used his grandson as a model for the plaster cherubs and modelled the full figured seen near the stage after Bacchus and Apollo. The wooden floors of the St. James were made of rimu and jarrah, along with totara for window frames and [...] for doors. After the plans had been set, construction began on the theatre in March 1912. To speed progress, White himself designed two electric cranes to lift the in excess of 500 tonnes of steel. In all, the St. James cost £32,000 to build and took 9 months to build.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Cow</b> <b>hair</b> and dander are {{important}} inducers of occupational allergies in cattle-exposed farmers. To estimate allergen exposure in farming environments, a sensitive enzyme immunoassay {{was developed to}} measure <b>cow</b> <b>hair</b> allergens. Methods: A sandwich ELISA was developed using polyclonal rabbit antibodies against a mixture of hair extracts from different cattle breeds. To assess the specificity of the assay, extracts from other mammalian epithelia, mites, molds and grains were tested. To validate the new assay, <b>cow</b> <b>hair</b> allergens were measured in passive airborne dust samples from the stables and homes of farmers. Dust was collected with electrostatic dust fall collectors (EDCs). Results: The sandwich ELISA {{was found to be}} very sensitive (detection limit: 0. 1 ng/ml) and highly reproducible, demonstrating intra-and interassay coefficients of variation of 4 and 10 %, respectively. The assay showed no reactivity with mites, molds and grains, but some cross-reactivity with other mammalian epithelia, with the strongest reaction with goat. Using EDCs for dust sampling, high concentrations of bovine allergens were measured in cow stables (4, 760 - 559, 400 mu g/m(2)). In addition, bovine allergens were detected in all areas of cattle farmer dwellings. A large variation was found between individual samples (0. 3 - 900 mu g/m(2)) and significantly higher values were discovered in changing rooms. Conclusion: The ELISA developed for the detection of <b>cow</b> <b>hair</b> proteins is a useful tool for allergen quantification in occupational and home environments. Based on its low detection limit, this test is sensitive enough to detect allergens in passive airborne dust. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E

40|$|Hair {{cortisol}} {{levels are}} increasingly applied {{as a measure}} for stress in humans and mammals. Cortisol is an endogenous compound and is always present within the hair matrix. Therefore, “cortisol-free hair matrix” is a critical point for any analytical method to accurately quantify especially low cortisol levels. The aim of this project was to modify current methods used for hair cortisol analysis to more accurately determine low endogenous cortisol concentrations in hair. For that purpose, 13 C 3 -labeled cortisol, which is not naturally present in hair (above 13 C natural abundance levels), was used for calibration and comparative validation applying cortisol versus 13 C 3 -labeled cortisol. Cortisol was extracted from 20 mg hair (standard sample amount) applying an optimized single step extraction protocol. An LC–MS/MS method was developed for the quantitative analysis of cortisol using either cortisol or 13 C 3 -cortisol as calibrators and D 7 -cortisone as internal standard (IS). The two methods (cortisol/ 13 C 3 -labeled cortisol) were validated in a concentration range up to 500 pg/mg and showed good linearity for both analytes (cortisol: R 2 = 0. 9995; 13 C 3 -cortisol R 2 = 0. 9992). Slight differences were observed for limit of detection (LOD) (0. 2 pg/mg/ 0. 1 pg/mg) and limit of quantification (LOQ) (1 pg/mg/ 0. 5 pg/mg). Precision was good with a maximum deviation of 8. 8 % and 10 % for cortisol and 13 C 3 -cortisol respectively. Accuracy and matrix effects were good for both analytes except for the quality control (QC) low cortisol. QC low (2. 5 pg/mg) showed matrix effects (126. 5 %, RSD 35. 5 %) and accuracy showed a deviation of 26 % when using cortisol to spike. These effects {{are likely to be}} caused by the unknown amount of endogenous cortisol in the different hair samples used to determine validation parameters like matrix effect, LOQ and accuracy. No matrix effects were observed for the high QC (400 pg/mg) samples. Recovery was good with 92. 7 %/ 87. 3 % (RSD 9. 9 %/ 6. 2 %) for QC low and 102. 3 %/ 82. 1 % (RSD 5. 8 %/ 11. 4 %) for QC high. After successful validation the applicability of the method could be proven. The study shows that the method is especially useful for determining low endogenous cortisol concentrations as they occur in <b>cow</b> <b>hair</b> for example...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the risk factors associated with 3 presentations of hock lesions (hair loss, ulceration, and swelling) in freestall-housed lactating cattle. By independent identification and scoring of, and analysis of the factors associated with, hair loss, ulceration, and swelling, the aim was to identify whether risk factors were common to all 3, or differed among the presentations. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 76 herds in the UK during the winter housing period of 2007 to 2008, with a total of 3, 691 cows examined for hock lesions. A randomly selected sample of approximately 50 cows in each herd were scored for body condition, lameness, cleanliness, rising behavior, and lesions at the hocks. For all <b>cows,</b> <b>hair</b> loss, ulceration, and swelling were scored separately on 4 -point scales, with both left and right hocks scored. Based on a review of the literature, potential risk factors were identified and measured, collected from milk-recording data, or obtained through interviews with the farmers. Risk factors associated with hocks lesions in cattle were examined using data from the 2, 982 cows housed in the 63 freestall-housed herds visited. Risk factors for each of the 3 lesion presentations were considered separately in multilevel logistic regression models, with moderate or severe hair loss, any degree of ulceration, and moderate or severe swelling as the outcome variables. Thirty risk factors were identified, none of which were common to all 3 lesion presentations. Five risk factors (locomotion score, number of days of winter housing, mean milk yield, freestall base material, and herd size) were common to both hair loss and ulceration. The stall bedding material was a common risk factor for both hair loss and swelling. A further 8, 5, and 11 risk factors were unique to hair loss, ulceration, and swelling, respectively. The existence of several differential risk factors between the 2 lesion presentations suggests that ulceration may not always be a direct extension of hair loss, as has been implied in previous scoring systems. Of the 12 risk factors associated with swelling, only 1 was common to another lesion presentation, which suggests that swelling may have a different etiology than hair loss and ulceration. The variables associated with the lesions indicate the importance of factors that affect the lying and rising behavior of the animal, including freestall structure and design, and the lying surface...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} of 5186 hock maps, from 3691 <b>cows</b> with <b>hair</b> loss on the hocks from 76 UK dairy farms, identified six risk {{factors associated with}} area of hair loss: higher locomotion score; poor cleanliness; higher mean milk yield; low body condition score, prolonged winter housing and certain combinations of stall base and bedding materials. Another finding was significantly poor correlation between a categorical scale and the continuous measure of hair loss. Hair loss on the hocks of 70 heifers (three herds) was observed monthly from Sep 2008 -Mar 2010. The results imply that lameness precedes hair loss on the hock and not vice versa, i. e. lame animals develop hair loss rather than hock hair loss leads to future lameness. Poor cleanliness score and higher milk yield were associated positively with {{the risk of having}} hair loss on the hock. Based on the total 6889 observations from 731 cows in four herds, cows with a greater decrease in BCS (compared to BCS at calving) had higher probability of becoming lame and lower probability of recovering. Also, increase in BCS from calving was associated with lower probability of cows moving from non-lame to lame state and higher probability from lame to non-lame. Days of lactation, months of calving and parity impacted upon both non-lame to lame and lame to non-lame transitions. Analysis of 678 cows from four herds found that cows with chronic lameness had a lower probability of conception and a longer calving to conception period compared with healthy cows.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in animal welfare topics {{and the question}} on how to measure it is still under debate. Dairy cattle are often challenged with stressful practices but housing conditions {{are among the most}} important. Determination of hypothalamus- pituitary-adrenal axis activity evaluates stress conditions in farm animals, however, blood cortisol concentrations vary due to several factors and the release of cortisol is generally irregular and difficult to interpret. The use of hair as a suitable biological matrix to assess chronic stress in animals has been recently proposed by many authors. To establish dairy cow welfare an index method, named TOS-BBL, was developed taking into accountparameters mainly related to farm characteristics and housing systems; among these, free-stall and tie-stall housing represent a discriminant factor influencing animal welfare. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the correspondence of the TOS-BBL index with the hair cortisol concentration (HCC) and the influence of the housing system on the same parameters in dairy <b>cows.</b> Eighty <b>hair</b> samples were carefully obtained using clippers from the tail switch of ten pluriparous dairy cows reared in eight farms located in Mugello area (Florence). HCC analysis was performed according to the method described elsewhere. Animal welfare level was performed by TOS-BBL index method that defines increasing welfare levels with a 1 - 5 scale. Spearman's correlation between TOS-BBL and HCC was calculated; HCC was related with housing system by ANOVA test; differences between welfare index and housing system was determined by Pearson Chi square test. Results showed a significant negative correlation between welfare index and HCC (r= 0. 345, P< 0. 0017) suggesting a correspondence between the two measures. HCC resulted influenced by the housing system (P< 0. 0001) with higher level of this stress indicator in tie-stall (2. 76 pg/mg, SE 0. 632) than in free-stall (1. 63 pg/mg, SE 0. 221). Mean welfare score was 1. 7 ± 0. 48 and 4. 2 ± 0. 40 respectively in the tie-stall and free-stall systems (P< 0. 001). However HCC resulted lower than those found in Italian-Friesian cows by other Authors. These first results indicate the correspondence between TOS-BBL index and HCC. In the inspected farms animals seem not affected by chronic stress, although free-stall system assure more suitable living condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} the routine analyses, applied until present, of whole blood, serum and urine for bioelements is limited. The blood mineral level does not often {{correspond}} {{to the content of}} minerals in the whole body because the composition of plasma results from supplementation of deficiencies by different homeostatic mechanisms. Moreover, the blood concentration of bioelements is relatively low and depends on a current diet, therefore the diagnostic value of such analytical results may be fairly small. Studies have shown that the analysis of hair and nails are an appropriate alternative for blood and urine tests or for biopsy. Chemical treatments in agriculture, animal production and food processing in-troduce many food contaminants into the food chain. Organic methods in agriculture are safer and therefore very important. Nutrition based on organically produced foods and an-throposophic lifestyle can {{play an important role in}} health prophylaxis The objective of this study was to determine correlations between concentrations of 29 major and trace ele-ments in <b>cow’s</b> milk and <b>hair.</b> The experimental material consisted of 33 cows of Polish Holstein-Fresian (HF) breed from three dairy organic farms. All the farms were located in one climatic zone and under similar soil conditions. The cows were kept in traditional tied-up barns. The feeding was traditional, with ration components given separately. The cows were grazed from May to October. Depending on pasture yield and availability of other feeds, the feeding ration was supplemented with hay, straw, silage and cereals. Samples of milk and hair for analyses of minerals were collected in September, i. e. during the pastur...|$|R

Therefore, {{the assessment of}} long-term hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function using non-invasive techniques is useful. The aims in this study were: to measure cortisol concentration in <b>cow</b> and calves <b>hair</b> by radioimmunoassay (RIA), to test cortisol accumulation in bovine hair after adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenges, and {{determine the influence of}} hair color on cortisol concentrations. Fifteen Holstein heifers were allotted to 3 groups (n = 5 each) : in control group (C), just the hair was sampled; in the saline solution group (SS), IV saline solution was administered on days 0, 7, and 14; and the ACTH group was challenged 3 times with ACTH (0. 15 UI per kg of body weight) on days 0, 7, and 14. Serum samples from the SS and ACTH groups were obtained 0, 60 and 90 min post-injection. Serum cortisol concentration was greater 60 and 90 min after injection with ACTH. Hair was clipped on days 0, 14, 28, and 44. Hair cortisol was methanol extracted and measured by RIA. Hair cortisol was preserved for 11 mo. Hair cortisol concentrations in the ACTH group were greater than in the saline and control groups on days 14 and 28, but not on day 44. Concentrations were greater in calves than in cows and greater in white hair than in black hair. Cortisol accumulated in bovine hair after ACTH challenges, but the concentration was affected by both age and hair color. If hair color effects are taken into account, assessing cortisol concentration in hair is a potentially useful non-invasive method for assessing stress in cattle...|$|R
40|$|Little is {{understood}} {{about how the}} diversity of genes, specifically the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and interleukin- 8 receptor (CXCR 2), are related to reproductive health and how this affects physical traits in cattle. Glucocorticoid receptors have been positively associated with higher milk yields, lactose content, feed intake, and feed conversion rates. Interleukin- 8 genes {{are part of the}} innate immune response and help with many aspects of female reproductive health, such as protecting the embryo from the maternal immune system during pregnancy. The objective of this research was to identify polymorphisms in the GR and CXCR 2 genes and to associate genotypes between the abovementioned polymorphisms and production traits in crossbred cattle. The hypothesis was that polymorphisms will exist for GR and CXCR 2 genes and will be linked to production traits. Blood samples were collected from 94 crossbred cattle over a period of 3 years (2012, 2013, 2014) and the DNA was extracted, amplified, and sent to GeneSeek in Lincoln, Nebraska, to be analyzed and genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Phenotypic data, including cow pre-breeding body condition score (BCS) and weight, Julian calving date, calf birth weight, cow weaning BCS and weight, calf weaning weight, calf adjusted 205 -day weight, <b>cow</b> efficiency, and <b>hair</b> coat scores (HCS) were collected from the 94 crossbred cattle and analyzed alongside the genotypic results. Significant relationships were determined using t-tests. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were found for the GR and CXCR 2 genes and the polymorphisms were significantly related to production traits in cattle. Scientists and breeders could manipulate these genes to produce cattle that are more efficient and possess more desirable production traits...|$|R
50|$|Hair {{is used in}} plaster as {{a binding}} medium, and gives {{tenacity}} to the material. Traditionally horsehair was {{the most commonly used}} binder, as it was easily available before the development of the motor-car. Hair functions {{in much the same way}} as the strands in fiberglass resin, by controlling and containing any small cracks within the mortar while it dries or when it is subject to flexing. Ox-hair, which is sold in three qualities, is now the kind usually specified; but horsehair, which is shorter, is sometimes substituted or mixed with the ox-hair in the lower qualities. Good hair should be long (In the UK <b>cow</b> and horse <b>hair</b> of short and long lengths is used), and left greasey (lanolin grease) because this protects against some degradation when introduced into the very high alkaline plaster1. Before use it must be well beaten, or teased, to separate the lumps. In America, goats' hair is frequently used, though it is not so strong as ox-hair. The quantity used in good work is one pound of hair to two or three cubic feet of coarse stuff (in the UK up to 12 kg per metric cube). Hair reinforcement in lime plaster is common, and many types of hair and other organic fibres can be found in historic plasters 4. However, organic material in lime will degrade in damp environments, particularly on damp external renders.5 This problem has given rise to the use of polyprolene fibres in new lime renders 6. Research presented at the UK Building Limes Forum 2012 looked at the potential for hair degradation in lime plasters. Manila hemp fiber has been used as a substitute for hair. Plaster for hair slabs made with manila hemp fiber broke at 195 lb (88 kg), plaster mixed with sisal hemp at 150 lb (68 kg), jute at 145 lb (66 kg), and goats' hair at 144 lb (65 kg). Another test was made in the following manner. Two barrels of mortar were made up of equal proportions of lime and sand, one containing the usual quantity of goats' hair, and the other Manila fiber. After remaining in a dry cellar for nine months the barrels were opened. It was found that the hair had been almost entirely eaten away by the action of the lime, and the mortar consequently broke up and crumbled quite easily. The mortar containing the Manila hemp, on the other hand, showed great cohesion, and required some effort to pull it apart, the hemp fiber being undamaged.|$|R
