50|$|The <b>Camelback's</b> design raised {{concerns}} for its crew. The engineer was perched above the side-rods of the locomotive, vulnerable to swinging and flying metal; if anything below should break. In addition, the fireman {{was exposed to}} the elements at the rear. The Interstate Commerce Commission banned further construction of <b>camelbacks,</b> but gave exceptions to allow some to be completed. In 1927, further orders were completely prohibited on grounds of safety.|$|R

However, when he finally began his minor league rehab assignment at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga in late August, he struggled at the plate and his return date was pushed back. He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to <b>Camelback</b> Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.|$|E
5|$|Kraken Unleashed (named for {{the fictional}} sea monster {{of the same}} name) is a steel floorless roller coaster located at SeaWorld Orlando in the United States.

The refurbishment included Virtual Reality.|$|E
5|$|M-86 {{currently}} uses two bridges {{eligible for}} listing on the NRHP. The span over the St. Joseph River in Three Rivers {{was built in}} 1903. It is a five-span concrete arch bridge constructed to look as though created from stacked masonry blocks. The current railings were added in 1952 by the MSHD during a repair project. The second historic structure is the bridge over the Prairie River in Centreville. This <b>camelback</b> pony truss span was moved to its current location in 1938–39, although it was originally built on an unknown location in 1923. In the move, two sidewalks, one {{on either side of}} the trusses, were eliminated from the structure. This project was part of Public Works Administration relief work in the area.|$|E

50|$|John E. Wootten {{developed}} the Wootten firebox to effectively burn anthracite waste, {{which was a}} plentiful, cheap source of fuel. Wootten determined that a large, wide firebox would work best. As the successful trailing truck used to support large fireboxes {{had not yet been}} developed, Wootten instead mounted his huge firebox above the locomotive's driving wheels. The problem now arose that with a cab floor at the then standard tender deck height, it would be impossible for the locomotive's engineer to see forwards around the firebox shoulders. Instead, a cab for the engineer was placed above and astride the boiler. The fireman, however, remained at the rear with minimal protection from the elements. This gave rise to the unusual shape of the <b>camelbacks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|FireChaser Express {{theme is}} based off the several volunteer-based fire {{departments}} surrounding the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the 1940s. After a brief message from Fire Chief Embers, the stations siren goes {{off as the}} [...] "truck" [...] launches {{out of the station}} and navigates a few curves before hitting the chain lift. The ride proceeds into a small curve drop into another curve then a drop into several <b>camelbacks.</b> After the <b>camelbacks</b> the train goes through a tower and navigates through Crazy Charlies fireworks testing range before hitting an s-bend and entering Charlie Cherribaums Gasoline and Fireworks Emporium, through the storage warehouse. Charlie panics, saying he sees smoke, but then dismisses it {{as a result of his}} paranoia as a spark ignites a box of firecrackers and a few tanks of gas. The fire catches Charlie by surprise, and he tells the volunteers (riders) to watch out for Big Bertha and to leave the building; as he says this, a large firecracker labeled [...] "Big Bertha" [...] falls into a position where it points directly at the train, and the fire ignites the fuse, which begins to throw sparks. As the fireworks start to go off, the room fills with smoke and a series of loud bangs are heard as the train accelerates backwards onto a different track, where it navigates a few more turns and passes underneath another fire tower before hitting the final brake run. Fire Chief Embers praises the work of the volunteers as the train in the station is launched. The track switches again as the train backs into the station, where riders unload and exit the station. The track length is 2427 ft.|$|R

50|$|On January 8, 1902 fifteen New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad commuters from New Rochelle {{were killed}} when a local New York Central Railroad train from White Plains missed a red light and rear-ended the train stopped in Park Avenue Tunnel. The {{accident}} was linked to exhaust smoke obstructing view of traffic signals. The resulting public outcry led to calls for electrification {{of the line and}} replacement of the then-overcrowded Grand Central Depot. In 1903 state legislators passed a law banning steam locomotives from Manhattan after June 30, 1908 and demanding electrification of New York Central Railroad (NYCRR). The company, which had already contemplated electrification, introduced electric traction on its Manhattan trunk lines in the end of 1906. The NYCRR mainline employed third rail electric supply because low clearance in the tunnels ruled out use of overhead lines. The trains changed electric locomotives for steam engines at Croton-Harmon and North White Plains. Other incoming trunk lines were largely electrified by 1923. The isolated Staten Island Railway, operated by Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, remained powered by outdated coal-fired 4-4-0 <b>camelbacks</b> and 2-4-4Ts hauling wooden cars.|$|R

25|$|Spring {{training}} began for the Dodgers on February 12, when {{pitchers and}} catchers reported to the team's spring training facility at <b>Camelback</b> Ranch in Glendale, Arizona. The Dodgers went into spring training with the lineup fairly set but a few issues remained to be worked out. The Dodgers had eight pitchers Clayton Kershaw, Chad Billingsley, Zach Greinke, Josh Beckett, Chris Capuano, Aaron Harang, Ted Lilly and Hyun-jin Ryu vying for five spots in the starting rotation.|$|E
25|$|In late 20th {{and early}} 21st centuries, {{substantial}} private and governmental resources have been invested in transforming the city's tarnished image.

25|$|Spring {{training}} for the 2011 season officially got under way on February 16, 2011 when the pitchers and catchers reported to <b>Camelback</b> Ranch. One pitcher who did not report, however, was reliever Ronald Belisario. For the third season in a row, Belisario missed his reporting date due to visa problems in his home country. Belisario remained stuck in Venezuela indefinitely, missing the entire season. The Dodgers also made news {{on the first day}} of camp by naming Clayton Kershaw as the opening day starting pitcher. The Dodgers pitching depth took a major hit when Vicente Padilla underwent surgery to repair a radial nerve injury and Jon Garland suffered a strained oblique muscle. The spring training injury problems continued with both third baseman Casey Blake and catcher Dioner Navarro suffering injuries that would keep them off the opening day roster.|$|E
25|$|Spring {{training}} got underway for the Dodgers on February 15, 2017, when {{pitchers and}} catchers officially reported to <b>Camelback</b> Ranch to begin their workouts. The Dodgers made a trade early in spring training, sending pitcher Chase De Jong to the Seattle Mariners for minor league infielder Drew Jackson and minor league pitcher Aneurys Zabala. With most of the positions in the lineup locked in before camp, the major battle was {{for the last couple}} of spots in the starting rotation behind Clayton Kershaw, Rich Hill and Kenta Maeda. In the mix were veterans Brandon McCarthy, Scott Kazmir and Hyun-jin Ryu, all of whom were coming back from injuries as well as Alex Wood, Ross Stripling, Julio Urias and Brock Stewart. McCarthy and Ryu won the rotation spots, with Stripling and Wood in the bullpen to start.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{opened their}} 2010 {{training}} camp at <b>Camelback</b> Ranch on February 20, when {{pitchers and catchers}} reported to camp. The rest of the position players arrived on February 25 and the exhibition season began on March 5 with an 8–3 victory over the Chicago White Sox. With most of the roster spots set heading into the spring the main competition {{was expected to be}} the battle for the Dodgers fifth starter spot among a cast that included Eric Stults, Charlie Haeger, James McDonald, Scott Elbert, Russ Ortiz, Ramón Ortiz and Carlos Monasterios. The Dodgers also needed to pick a starting second baseman from the trio of Blake DeWitt, Ronnie Belliard and Jamey Carroll. Early in the spring, the Dodgers signed veteran outfielder Garret Anderson to a minor league contract and brought him in to compete for a bench role.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers began spring {{training}} at <b>Camelback</b> Ranch on February 19, 2015, when {{pitchers and catchers}} reported. They suffered their first significant injury of the season just {{before the start of}} camp when closer Kenley Jansen underwent surgery to remove a growth on his foot, sidelining him for all of camp and the start of the season. The Dodgers added to their depth with two additional free agent signings the first weekend of camp. They signed starting pitcher Brandon Beachy to a one-year, $2.75 million, contract that included a club option for 2016. Coming off Tommy John surgery, Beach was not expected to be ready to join the team until mid-season. They also signed pitcher Dustin McGowan to a one-year contract to add depth to the bullpen and possibly serve as a spot starter if needed. However, McGowan did not pitch well in {{spring training}} and was released at the end of March.|$|E
