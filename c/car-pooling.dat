However, although passengers generally compensate car owners for travel, but the amount of these reimbursements is difficult to estimate in detail.

40|$|Mobility as a Service is a quite novel {{term and}} has not a {{commonly}} agreed definition yet. In this report we use the term Combined mobility services to describe a service offering, including public transport {{in combination with other}} transport modes such as taxi, car-sharing, bike-sharing etc. The drivers for the change in how we will consume mobility are multiple, but the report discusses Societal trends such as Urbanisation ad climate change and sharing economy, Economical trends such as excess capacity and new payment systems together with technological development as enabler for the transition.   New mobility services are constantly entering the market, {{and one of the most}} well-known is UBER. The limousine brokering service that, based on a technological platform have expanded around the world and also in terms of the service offering, now offering services covering the taxi-segment and now starting to offer services very close to public transport. The auto-makers are starting to grasp a possible different future, and are launching mobility services such as <b>car-pool,</b> free-floating <b>car-pools</b> and simplified car-owning schemes. Especially in the Nordic countries, the concept of MaaS is taking of, with services like Ubigo, which was piloted in Goteborg during 2014 and MaaS. fi, a Finnish MaaS-service to be started in 2016 in Finland with the goal of a global expansion. Telecom actors like Ericsson and Sonera are also active in this area. In Sweden, the public transport sector is analysing which role they should take in the MaaS-actor-ecosystem, and in Västra Götaland, a pre-commercial procurement of combined mobility services is scheduled for 2016. On a European level, the MaaS-alliance, supported by ERTICO[1], was formed during 2015 with the aim to stimulate the implementation of MaaS in Europe. EU also supports the concept by issuing a specific topic for MaaS in the 2016 H 2020 mobility call. There are also a series of research-project ongoing, especially in Sweden and Finland, studying MaaS from a institutional, business and technical perspective. However, few studies are currently researching the sustainability effects of MaaS, even though initial studies indicates that MaaS, if designed bad, also can have negative environmental effects.   Mobility as a Service can be designed in different ways and with different types of actors as the lead. If the public transport should be the coordinator of MaaS or a facilitating collaborator is discussed in the report. The report argues that public transport can provide a better stability of such a service (compared to a commercial MaaS operator), but also that public transport do not have the same flexibility in service offering as an external actor, and that they may attract more public transport users than car-owners to the service, in which case the environmental effects can be negative. The report also argues that if MaaS-service is subsidized (other than the services provided by PT), it can also lead to negative rebound effects, and if it is NOT subsidized, there are less reasons why public transport should organise the MaaS-service. UITP, the international organisation for public transport, have an active process for combined mobility services, CMS,(as MaaS is named in the PT sector) and promotes PT to take an active or even leading role in the establishment of this.   In the report, some models are introduced for describing different types of mobility services emerging, and the most important distinction of what the report describes as MaaS, is that a Combined Mobility Service provides a subscription of some kind and possibly also a re-packaging of included services, while integrated public transport mainly gives the user the possibility to plan, book, and pay for the whole journey with several transport modes in one service (app). CMS is therefore both a business model and a technical platform which draws its profitability on the reduction of privately owned cars, whilst integrated public transport represents mainly a technical integration which mainly simplifies the shift between modes for a single trip. Both these versions are often referred as MaaS-services.   The eco-system of MaaS, and different actor roles are introduced in the report, showing that there are business opportunities for Maas-operators, platform providers, mobility service providers as well as for public transport if the MaaS-service is designed in a right way.   Several institutional barriers are identified in the report, which if addressed, could facilitate a faster introduction of MaaS. The Swedish transport subsidy system is discussed, where subsidizing of cars is allowed, but not the subsidizing of mobility services. The role of public transport and the importance of PT (brand) facing the customer, or if a neutral actor is better in attracting private car-owners to exchange the car for mobility services. The technical matureness of public transport is addressed, while a digitized business process (buying, paying and distributing electronic tickets) is a prerequisite for a commercial MaaS-operator to be able to include public transport in the service offering. Technically, Swedish public transport has a very good position through the work done at X 2 AB/Samtrafiken, but the policy issues around the possibility for third-party actors to use this, is not yet addressed, especially not on a national level. Finally several areas are identified where more research is needed to fully understand and take advantage of the possibilities with MaaS. The foremost area, where few initiatives have been identified, is the sustainability effects of MaaS. If wrongly designed, MaaS can give environmental effects of the service are negative (e. g making PT users to use more <b>car-pools),</b> and positive effects are gained if citizens are exchanging the owning of a car with subscription of mobility services. Other identified research areas are social factors like accessibility are effected by less car-ownership and the introduction of MaaS, how MaaS can contribute to resource efficiency, how MaaS can be supported by policy integration and other institutional issues.   [1] European network for ITS deployment. www. ertico. comMaaS Framewor...|$|R

The objective was broken down into four research question: RQ 1 Within a food and retail company, what could be suitable product categories to transform into circular economic based solutions? RQ 2 Which potential actors are influenced and need to be involved if a food and retail company wants to implement circular economic based solutions? RQ 3 If implementing circular economic based solutions, what potential challenges might a food and retail company experience? RQ 4 If implementing circular economic based solutions, what potential benefits might a food and retail company experience? The research plan for the thesis consisted of the case study of ICA, a literature study, semi-structured interviews as well as observations. The research found numerous product categories for circular implementations such as; product design & development, transport options for customers such as <b>car-pools</b> and rentals of bicycles, circular packaging, in-store rental structures, improved waste-management structures, collection structures for used goods and lastly, the rental implementation of solar panels. Actors perceived as important in the transition towards circular economy were also identified by the respondents and are; municipalities in which ICA operates business, suppliers of goods, the corporate office and a specialized design team, merchants and the increasingly powerful customer. Furthermore, the result of the research shows an increasing desire within all respondents to further ICA Groups sustainability measures in addition to a strong willingness from the merchants for implementing circular structures. The research also identified potential challenges as well as benefits, which were found within the respondents. The challenges were found to encompass the classic challenges, which face CE implementation and surrounded the creating of viable and rational economic structures for implementations. The benefits found stemmed back to the economic benefit of becoming more resource efficient as well as a stronger environmental profile, which in turn would lead to a strong competitive advantage on the market...|$|R

Results of applications to real test-sites will be presented. LONG. This paper deals with the simulation of mode choice behaviour for extra-urban journeys. They are generally home-based, and the mode choice behaviour is greatly affected by user socio-economic characteristic, whilst the effect of level of service (LoS) attributes can be significantly non-linear, and a relevant fraction of users may be captive to a specific mode. Moreover, the zoning {{as well as the}} access and egress to the transit system can often be modelled only at an aggregate level, due to data availability. Finally, the structure of dispersion matrix among the perceived utility may likely be quite complex also due to unusual modes, such as <b>car-pool,</b> dial-a-ride, ….. These considerations are not in favour of models used for urban journeys, which turn out quite rigid with respect to LoS attributes, and are often greatly determined by alternative specific attributes (ASA) when applied to extra-urban journeys. This paper follows a random utility approach and focuses on the effects of hypotheses and data on the efficiency (how satisfactorily the real phenomenon is simulated) of the resulting model as well as its effectiveness (how easy to use the model is, and which data it requires). The Dogit model will be used to simulated user captivity to any alternatives, and Box-Cox transformation to test non-linearity of utility with respect to LoS attributes, whilst Cross-Nested Logit or Probit models to allow complex structures of the dispersion matrix. Spatial ASA will be adopted to avoid detailed zoning and access and egress representation. Some indices will also be presented and discussed to compare model effectiveness. The effectiveness will also be tested against artificial neural network models as a benchmark. Results of applications to real test-sites will be presented to support general considerations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCarpooling is a {{transport}} {{system based on}} a shared use of private cars. The mobility managers of the Università Statale and Politecnico di Milano universities are interested in promoting {{the use of such}} system among their students and employees. The paper presents an ongoing project to design, implement and test PoliUniPool, a car pooling service for such universities. The main characteristics of the PoliUniPool service are the following: (1) the use of the system is restricted to employees, faculty and students of the two universities; (2) besides suggesting a matching between the users, the system provides the expected schedule for their trips; (3) in addition to the campus premises, users can select – as destination of their car pooling trips – the main railway and subway stations, in order to encourage the most environmental friendly means; (4) users are informed immediately in case of delay or changes, to improve the reliability of the service; (5) the system estimates the costs for each user, in order to let the users know how to share them; (6) the system has some social network functionalities, e. g. drivers are able to set partial pre-arranged crews; and users may indicate other users they would prefer to <b>car-pool</b> with (“friends”) or they don’t want to (“I don’t like him/her”). A web-based software tool has been implemented to manage the matching of the users. In order to solve the carpooling problem, we use an heuristics, based on a guided Monte Carlo method. The algorithm minimizes an objective function, subject to user time windows and car capacity constraints. The objective function is a weighted sum of different terms in order to maximize the number of served users, minimizing the total route length, and maximizing the satisfied user preferences (e. g. friends). The result is a matching between drivers and passengers, their schedules and the routes to be driven by each driver. The trial of the proposed service will start on September 2011 and will take into account how to introduce and promote the service, identifying regulation, incentives, modalities, and marketing actions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the political}} and practical conditions for introducing electric vehicles in Swedish public authorites and discusses the potential for using electric vehicles in public transport and public fleets. The work {{has been carried out}} using an interdisciplinary research approach. Such an approach brings new insights to energy studies; the combination of technical methods and methods from social science allows the technology to be studied in its societal context. Local self-government enables Swedish public authorities to implement local solutions in order to achieve national policy goals. However, the results show that for energy and transport policy a clear allocation of responsibilities between local and regional levels is lacking – and this clarity is also lacking between the different policy areas. The lack of policy integration implies a risk that local policy development can miss the mark {{when it comes to the}} overall policy goal. Furthermore, findings show that so-called policy entrepreneurs can succeed in putting electric vehicles on the political agenda, and they can enforce decisions and deploy the vehicles within the public bodies. The usage of plug-in electric vehicles in public fleets has been studied using (among other sources) logbooks, interviews, questionnaires and focus groups. Findings demonstrate a great potential to introduce plug-in electric vehicles through fleets. Although the usage varied slightly during the year, and winter conditions implied a general reduction in use, the results show that the deployment strategy is a central factor for the extent of the vehicle usage. Vehicles that are assigned a certain user or a specific task show a high degree of utilisation. Even though plug-in electric vehicles available through <b>car-pools</b> have a large potential group of users, the options also implies that users can instead choose a conventional vehicle. However, interventions to increase usage have proven to be successful. Policy entrepreneurial actions attract new users and revising organisational regulations, i. e. vehicle or environmental policies, shapes new behaviours. In this study, fleet vehicle users have proven to be relative indifferent to which fuel or technology they use, but acceptance for operation failure is very low. Based on a demonstration project of series hybrid buses in regular service, the possibility of increased electrification of public transport is discussed. The contribution of hybridisation is analysed through assessment of different types of driving conditions. Results show that significant improvements in energy efficiency can be achieved but, because actual and optimal driving conditions differ, there is a risk of overestimating the contribution. Sweden has set very ambitious national targets for its road transport system, i. e. to be fossil-fuel independent by 2030, and electrification is an important measure in reaching this goal. Given the magnitude of the challenge, it is not only the responsible thing to do; findings also show several advantages of introducing electric vehicles in the public sector first.   QC 20150916 </p...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{management}} of moving object data, originating in supply chain operations, road network monitoring, and other RFID applications, {{is a major}} challenge facing society today, with important implications into business optimization, city planning, privacy, and national security. Towards the solution of this problem, I have developed a comprehensive framework for warehousing, mining, and cleaning large moving object data sets. The proposed framework addresses the following key challenges present in object tracking applications: (1) Datasets are massive, a single large retailer may generate terabytes of moving object data per day. (2) Data is usually dirty, many tags are not detected at all, or are incorrectly detected at the wrong location. (3) Dimensionality is very large, there are spatio-temporal dimensions defined by object trajectories, sensor related dimensions such as temperature or humidity recorded at different locations, and item level dimensions describing the attributes of each object. (4) Data analysis and mining need to navigate and discover interesting patterns, {{at different levels of}} abstraction, and involving a large number of interrelated records in multiple datasets. At the core of my dissertation, is the RFID data warehousing engine. It receives clean data from the cleaning engine, and provides highly compressed data, at multiple levels of abstraction, to the mining engine. The mining engine is composed of three modules. The first, mines commodity flow patterns that identify general flow trends and significant flow exceptions in a large supply chain operation. The second, makes route recommendations, based on observed driving behavior and traffic conditions. And the third, discovers and characterizes a wide variety of traffic anomalies on a road network. RFID Data Warehousing. A data warehouse is an enterprise level data repository that collects and integrates organizational data in order to provide decision support analysis. At the core of the data warehouse is the data cube, which computes an aggregate measure (e. g., sum, avg, count) for all possible combination of dimensions of a fact table (e. g., sales for 2004, in the northeast). Online analytical processing (OLAP) operations provide the means for exploration and analysis of the data cube. My research on this direction has extended the data cube to handle moving object data sets, by significantly compressing such data, and proposing a new aggregation mechanism that preserves its path structure. The RFID warehouse is built around the concept of the movement graph, which records both spatio-temporal and item level information in a compact model. We show that compression and query processing efficiency can be significantly improved, by partitioning the movement graph around gateway nodes, which are special locations connecting different spatial regions in the graph. RFID Data Cleaning. Efficient and accurate data cleaning is an essential task for the successful deployment of applications, such as object tracking and inventory management systems, based on RFID technology. Most existing data cleaning approaches do not consider the overall cost of cleaning in an environment that possibly includes thousands of readers and millions of tags. We propose a cleaning framework that takes an RFID data set and a collection of cleaning methods, with associated costs, and induces a cleaning plan that optimizes the overall accuracy-adjusted cleaning costs. The cleaning plan determines the conditions under which inexpensive cleaning methods can be safely applied, the conditions under which more expensive methods are absolutely necessary, and those cases when a combination of several methods is the optimal policy. Through a variety of experiments we show that our framework can achieve better accuracy {{at a fraction of the}} cost than that obtained by applying any single technique. Mining Flow Trends. An important application of moving objects is mining movement patterns of objects in supply chain operations. In this context, one may ask questions regarding correlations between time spent at quality control locations and laptop return rates, salient characteristics of dairy products discarded from stores, or ships that spent abnormally long at intermediate ports before arrival. The gigantic size of such data, and the diversity of queries over flow patterns pose great challenges to traditional workflow induction and analysis technologies since processing may involve retrieval and reasoning over a large number of inter-related tuples through different stages of object movements. Creating a complete workflow that records all possible commodity movements and that incorporates time will be prohibitively expensive since there can be billions of different location and time combinations. I propose the FlowGraph, as a compressed probabilistic workflow, that captures the general flow trends and significant exceptions of a data set. The FlowGraph achieves compression by recording the set of major flow trends, and the set of non-redundant flow exceptions (i. e., abnormal transitions or durations) present in the data. I extended the concept of the FlowGraph to incorporate multiple levels of abstraction of object and path characteristics, and defined the FlowCube, which is a data cube that records FlowGraphs as measures, and that allows OLAP reasoning on object flows. Mining Route Recommendations. Modern highway networks provide several mechanisms for automatic vehicle identification. The most common are the use of toll collection transponders to detect vehicles at multiple points in the network, and the use of cameras to automatically identify license plates. Such information provides valuable patterns useful to online navigation systems and route planning applications. Most existing route planning applications use a fastest path algorithm based on static or dynamic models of road speeds, but such models in general disregard observed driver behavior, and other important factors such as weather, <b>car-pool</b> availability, or vehicle type. Existing solutions may, for example, provide a route that is the fastest one, but that goes through a high crime area, and is thus avoided by experienced drivers. We propose a traffic-mining-based path-finding method that mines speed and driving models from historic traffic data, and uses them to compute fast routes that are well supported by historic driving behavior under the set of relevant driving and traffic conditions. Mining Traffic Anomalies. Identification and characterization of traffic anomalies on massive road networks is a vital component of traffic monitoring. Anomaly identification can be used to reduce congestion, increase safety, and provide transportation engineers with better information for traffic forecasting and road network design. However, due to the size, complexity and dynamics of such transportation networks, it is challenging to automate the process. We propose a multi-dimensional mining framework that can be used to identify a concise set of anomalies from massive traffic monitoring data, and further overlay, contrast, and explore such anomalies in multi-dimensional space...|$|R
