5000|$|The {{appearance}} of the woolly mammoth {{is probably the best}} known of any prehistoric animal due to the many frozen specimens with preserved soft tissue and depictions by contemporary humans in their art. Fully grown males reached shoulder heights between 2.7 and 3.4 m and weighed up to 6 tonne ST. This is almost as large as extant male African elephants, which commonly reach a shoulder height of 3 - 3.4 m, and is less than the size of the earlier mammoth species M. meridionalis and M. trogontherii, and the contemporary M. columbi. The reason for the smaller size is unknown. Female woolly mammoths reached 2.6 - 2.9 m in shoulder heights and were built more lightly than males, weighing up to 4 tonne ST. A newborn calf would have weighed about 90 kg. These sizes are deduced from comparison with modern elephants of similar size. Few frozen specimens have preserved genitals, so the gender is usually determined through examination of the skeleton. The best indication of sex is the size of the pelvic girdle, since the opening that functions as the birth canal is always wider in females than in males. Though the mammoths on Wrangel Island were smaller than those of the mainland, their size varied, and they were not small enough to be considered [...] "dwarves". It has been claimed that the last woolly mammoth populations decreased in size and increased their sexual dimorphism, but this was dismissed in a 2012 study.Woolly mammoths had several adaptations to the cold, most noticeably the layer of fur covering all parts of the body. Other adaptations to cold weather include ears that are far smaller than those of modern elephants; they were about 38 cm long and 18 - 28 cm across, and the ear of the 6-12 month old frozen calf [...] "Dima" [...] was under 13 cm long. The small ears reduced heat loss and frostbite, and the tail was short for the same reason, only 36 cm long in the [...] "Berezovka mammoth". The tail contained 21 vertebrae, whereas the tails of modern elephants contain 28-33. Their skin was no thicker than that of present-day elephants, between 1.25 and 2.5 cm. They had a layer of fat up to 10 cm thick under the skin, which helped to keep them warm. Woolly mammoths had broad flaps of skin under their tails which covered the anus; this is also seen in modern elephants.Other characteristic features depicted in cave paintings include a large, high, single-domed head and a sloping back with a high shoulder hump; this shape resulted from the spinous processes of the back vertebrae decreasing in length from front to rear.

40|$|Abstract Background The flexion {{relaxation}} phenomenon (FRP) is {{an interesting}} model to study the modulation of lumbar stability. Previous investigations have explored the effect of load, angular velocity and posture on this particular response. However, the influence of muscular fatigue on FRP parameters has not been thoroughly examined. The objective {{of the study is}} to identify the effect of erector spinae (ES) muscle fatigue and spine loading on myoelectric silence onset and cessation in healthy individuals during a flexion-extension task. Methods Twenty healthy subjects participated in this study and performed blocks of 3 <b>complete</b> <b>trunk</b> flexions under 4 different experimental conditions: no fatigue/no load (1), no fatigue/load (2), fatigue/no load(3), and fatigue/load (4). Fatigue was induced according to the Sorenson protocol, and electromyographic (EMG) power spectral analysis confirmed that muscular fatigue was adequate in each subject. Trunk and pelvis angles and surface EMG of the ES L 2 and L 5 were recorded during a flexion-extension task. Trunk flexion angle corresponding to the onset and cessation of myoelectric silence was then compared across the different experimental conditions using 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVA. Results Onset of myoelectric silence during the flexion motion appeared earlier after the fatigue task. Additionally, the cessation of myoelectric silence was observed later during the extension after the fatigue task. Statistical analysis also yielded a main effect of load, indicating a persistence of ES myoelectric activity in flexion during the load condition. Conclusion The {{results of this study suggest}} that the presence of fatigue of the ES muscles modifies the FRP. Superficial back muscle fatigue seems to induce a shift in load-sharing towards passive stabilizing structures. The loss of muscle contribution together with or without laxity in the viscoelastic tissues may have a substantial impact on post fatigue stability. </p...|$|E

GTR started its St. Clair River ferry service with a type of swing ferry-barge. The barge would be anchored by 1,000 feet of chain. When it was loaded the barge, would be released into the current to dock {{on the opposite side of}} the river. When this proved unreliable Grand Trunk replaced it with the wood-burning steamer International II in 1872. It would soon be joined in service by the steamer Huron. The ferries continued until 1891 when Grand <b>Trunk</b> <b>completed</b> its rail tunnel connecting Sarnia and Port Huron under the river. However, GTW and CN reinstated the ferry service 80 years later in 1971 with its Rail-Barge service to accommodate the larger freight railcars that were higher than the 1891 tunnel's height clearance. The St. Clair river barges discontinued service again in 1995 after the new larger St Clair Tunnel was completed.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSegmented body {{organizations}} are widely {{represented in the}} animal kingdom. Whether the last common bilaterian ancestor was already segmented is intensely debated. Annelids display broad morphological diversity but many species {{are among the most}} homonomous metameric animals. The front end (prostomium) and tail piece (pygidium) of annelids are classically described as non-segmental. However, the pygidium structure and development remain poorly studied. Using different methods of microscopy, immunolabelling and a number of molecular markers, we describe the neural and mesodermal structures of the pygidium of Platynereis dumerilii. We establish that the pygidium possesses a complicated nervous system with a nerve ring and a pair of sensory ganglia, a complex intrinsic musculature, a large terminal circular blood sinus and an unusual unpaired torus-shaped coelomic cavity. We also describe some earlier steps of pygidial development and pygidial structure of mature animals after epitokous transformation. We describe a much more complex organization of the pygidium of P. dumerilii than previously suggested. Many of the characteristics are strikingly similar to those found in the trunk segments, opening the debate on whether the pygidium and trunk segments derive from the same ancestral metameric unit. We analyze these scenarios in the context of two classical theories on the origin of segmentation: the cyclomeric/archicoelomate concept and the colonial theory. Both theories provide possible explanations for the partial or <b>complete</b> homology of <b>trunk</b> segments and pygidium...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background As {{the older}} adult {{population}} increases, the potential functional and clinical burden of trunk muscle dysfunction may be significant. An evaluation {{of risk factors}} including {{the impact of the}} trunk muscles in terms of their temporal firing patterns, amplitudes of activation, and contribution to spinal stability is required. Therefore, the specific {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the feasibility of measuring the activation of trunk muscles in healthy older adults during specific leg exercises with trunk stabilization. Methods 12 asymptomatic adults 65 to 75 years of age were included in the study. Participants performed a series of trunk stability exercises, while bilateral activation of abdominal and back extensor muscles was recorded by 24 pairs of Meditrace™ surface electrodes. Maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVIC) were performed for electromyographic (EMG) normalization purposes. EMG waveforms were generated and amplitude measures as a percentage of MVIC were calculated along with ensemble average profiles. 3 D kinematics data were also recorded, using an electromagnetic sensor placed at the left lateral iliac crest. Furthermore, a qualitative assessment was conducted to establish the participant's ability to complete all experimental tasks. Results Excellent quality abdominal muscle activation data were recorded during the tasks. Participants performed the trunk stability exercises with an unsteady, intermittent motion, but were able to keep pelvic motion to less than 10 °. The EMG amplitudes showed that during these exercises, on average, the older adults recruited their abdominal muscles from 15 – 34 % of MVIC and back extensors to less than 10 % of MVIC. There were similarities among the abdominal muscle profiles. No participants reported pain during the testing session, although 3 (25 %) of the participants reported delayed onset muscle soreness during follow up that was not functionally limiting. Conclusion Older adults were able to successfully <b>complete</b> the <b>trunk</b> stability protocol that was developed for younger adults with some minor modifications. The collected EMG amplitudes were higher than those reported in the literature for young healthy adults. The temporal waveforms for the abdominal muscles showed a degree of synchrony among muscles, except for the early activation from the internal oblique prior to lifting the leg off the table. </p...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{our early}} experience with endovascular revascularization {{in patients with}} acute thromboembolic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). MethodsA retrospective review was conducted of all patients who underwent endovascular revascularization for acute thromboembolic SMA occlusion from May 2005 to May 2012. Endovascular revascularization was performed using aspiration, intra-arterial thrombolysis, and adjunctive stent-placement techniques. Laparotomy was performed if the patient developed clinical signs of advanced bowel ischemia after endovascular procedure. ResultsTwenty-one patients underwent endovascular revascularization for acute thromboembolic SMA occlusion. All presented with acute-onset abdominal pain. Three patients had rebound tenderness before the procedure. Computed tomography angiography revealed complete occlusion in seven cases and incomplete occlusion in 14 cases, with no evidence of free gas or bowel necrosis. The median duration from onset of symptoms to revascularization was 8. 7  ±  4. 1 hours (range, 2 – 18 hours). Completely successful endovascular revascularization occurred in six cases (aspiration alone, 3 cases; combined aspiration and urokinase, 3 cases); partial success was achieved in 15 cases (aspiration alone, 4 cases; combined aspiration and urokinase, 10 cases; and combined aspiration, urokinase, and stent placement, 1 case). Laparotomy was required in five patients, {{all of whom had}} SMA main <b>trunk</b> <b>complete</b> occlusion and required small bowel resection. The 30 -day mortality for all patients was 9. 5 %. During a median follow-up of 26 months, 15 patients remained asymptomatic, three patients reported occasional abdominal pain, and one patient had temporary short-bowel syndrome. ConclusionsPercutaneous revascularization is a promising alternative to surgery for acute SMA occlusion in selected patients who have no signs of advanced bowel ischemia. Early diagnosis followed by prompt endovascular intervention with close postprocedural monitoring is key. Laparotomy is indicated in patients who develop new or worsening signs of peritonism after endovascular procedure, particularly in those who had complete occlusion of the main trunk of the SMA...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInternal models serve sensory processing, {{sensorimotor}} {{integration and}} motor control. They {{could be a}} way to construct and update a sense of verticality, by combining vestibular and somatosensory graviception. We tested this hypothesis by investigating self-orientation relative to gravity in 39 normal subjects and in subjects with various somatosensory losses showing either a <b>complete</b> deafferentation of <b>trunk</b> and lower limbs (14 paraplegic patients after complete traumatic spinal cord injury) or a gradient in the degree of a hemibody sensory loss (23 hemiplegic patients after stroke). We asked subjects to estimate, in the dark, the direction of the Earth vertical in two postural conditions-upright and at lateral whole body tilt. For upright conditions, verticality estimates were not different {{from the direction of the}} Earth vertical in normal (0. 24 ° ± 1; P = 0. 42) and paraplegic subjects (0. 87 ° ± 0. 9; P = 0. 14). The within-subject variability was much greater in hemiplegic than in normal subjects (2. 05 ° ± 1. 15 versus 1. 06 ° ± 0. 4; P < 0. 01) and greater in paraplegic than in normal subjects (1. 13 ° ± 0. 4 versus 0. 72 ° ± 0. 4; P < 0. 01). These findings indicate that, even if vestibular graviception is intact, somaesthetic graviception contributes to the sense of verticality, leading to a more robust judgement about the direction of verticality when vestibular and somaesthetic graviception yield congruent information. As expected, when normal subjects were tilted, their verticality estimates were biased in the direction of the body tilt (5. 55 ° ± 3. 9). This normal modulation of verticality perception (Aubert effect), was preserved in hemiplegics on the side of the normoaesthetic hemibody (ipsilesional) (6. 09 ° ± 6. 3), and abolished both in paraplegics (1. 06 ° ± 2. 5) and in hemiplegics (0. 04 ° ± 6. 7) on the side of hypoaesthetic hemibody (contralesional). This incongruence did not exist in deafferented paraplegics who exclusively used vestibular graviception with a similar efficacy no matter what the lateral body position. The Aubert effect was not an on-off phenomenon since the degree of hemiplegics' somatosensory loss correlated with the modulation of verticality perception when they were tilted to the side of hypoaesthetic hemibody (r = - 0. 55; P < 0. 01). The analysis of anatomical correlates showed that the Aubert effect required the integrity of the posterolateral thalamus. This study reveals the existence of a synthesis of vestibular and somaesthetic graviception for which the posterolateral thalamus plays a major role. This corresponds to a primary property of internal models and yields the neural bases of the Aubert effect. We conclude that humans construct and update internal models of verticality in which somatosensory information plays an important role...|$|R
