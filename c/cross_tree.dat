40|$|We give characterisations for Brownian {{motion and}} {{continuous}} local martingales, using the <b>crossing</b> <b>tree,</b> {{which is a}} sample-path decomposition based on first-passages at nested scales. These results are based on ideas used {{in the construction of}} Brownian motion on the Sierpinski gasket (Barlow & Perkins 1988). Using our characterisation we propose a test for the continuous martingale hypothesis, that is, that a given process is a continuous local martingale. The <b>crossing</b> <b>tree</b> gives a natural break-down of a sample path at different spatial scales, which we use to investigate the scale at which a process looks like a continuous local martingale. Simulation experiments indicate that our test is more powerful than an alternative approach which uses the sample quadratic variation. ...|$|R
40|$|We present {{statistical}} {{tests for}} the continuous martingale hypothesis. That is, whether an observed {{process is a}} continuous local martingale, or equivalently a continuous time-changed Brownian motion. Our technique {{is based on the}} concept of the <b>crossing</b> <b>tree.</b> Simulation experiments are used to assess the power of the tests, which is generally higher than recently proposed tests using the estimated quadratic variation (i. e., realised volatility). In particular, the <b>crossing</b> <b>tree</b> shows significantly more power with shorter datasets. We then show results from applying the methodology to high frequency currency exchange rate data. We show that in 2003, for the AUD-USD, GBP-USD, JPY-USD and EUR-USD rates, at small timescales (less than 15 minutes or so) the continuous martingale hypothesis is rejected, but not so at larger timescales. For 2003 EUR-GBP data, the hypothesis is rejected at small timescales and some moderate timescales, but not all. Comment: v 2 : Revised titl...|$|R

This famous dancing tree, a fine old elm, cut and clipped {{in the form of}} a punch bowl (by which name it was also known), has long since disappeared, and in its place a beech tree has been planted.

50|$|The {{most likely}} {{explanation}} for the medieval nails is the ancient custom of hammering nails into <b>crosses,</b> <b>trees</b> and even rocks for protection or in gratitude for healing, that is as a votive offering, similar to throwing coins into a wishing well or a pond.

The original tree had become hollow and local children were often seen climbing inside it. It eventually succumbed to Dutch Elm disease and was felled in May 1977. Children at Wraxall School were given the day off to see the spectacle of the tree being craned and transported to Watercress Farm where it was burned for large barbecue. An oak tree has been planted in its place.|$|E

Early in the 19th century the building was converted from two tenements into four and the facade was damaged. By 1938 they had fallen into disrepair. In 1940 they were purchased for the town and converted back into two tenements. In 1952 they were purchased by the National Trust.|$|E

An alternative religious precursor is Micrography, a technique for creating visual images by Hebrew-speaking artists who create pictures using tiny arrangements of Biblical texts organized usually on paper in images which illustrate the text used. As noted in the entry, micrography allows the creation of images of natural objects by observant Jews without directly breaking the prohibition of creating [...] "graven images" [...] that might be interpreted as idolatry. The technique is now used by both religious and secular artists and is similar to the use of Arabic texts in Islamic calligraphy.|$|E
50|$|Throughout history sailing {{has been}} {{instrumental}} in the development of civilization, affording humanity greater mobility than travel over land, whether for trade, transport or warfare, and the capacity for fishing. The earliest representation of a ship under sail appears on a painted disc found in Kuwait dating between 5000 and 5500 BCE. Polynesian oceanfarers traveled vast distances of open ocean in outrigger canoes using navigation methods such as stick charts. Advances in sailing technology from the Middle Ages onward enabled Arab, Chinese, Indian and European explorers to make longer voyages into regions with extreme weather and climatic conditions. There were improvements in sails, masts and rigging; improvements in marine navigation including the <b>cross</b> <b>tree</b> and charts, of both the sea and constellations, allowed more certainty in sea travel. From the 15th century onwards, European ships went further north, stayed longer on the Grand Banks and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and eventually began to explore the Pacific Northwest and the Western Arctic. Sailing has contributed to many great explorations in the world.|$|E

50|$|At Mill Farm are {{the remains}} of a Windmill, {{consisting}} of the oak post, quarter bars and <b>cross</b> <b>trees</b> of a Post mill inside a brick roundhouse, now used as a store. Besthorpe Mill was built c. 1832, and ceased working by 1909 although the sails and machinery remained intact until at least the 1930s. In 1899 the miller Charles Merriman committed suicide inside the mill by cutting his throat. According to a tenant, Ron Wilkinson, who moved into the mill house in the 1930s the roundhouse floorboards were bloodstained. They were later concreted over.|$|R

40|$|Apocryphal {{stories of}} Adam {{related to the}} {{subjects}} of the Paradise lost, Adam’s repentance and expulsion from Eden, life of Adam and Eve after the expulsion, the manuscript that Adam gave to Satan, the Holy Cross story – all these subjects can be called the single Adamic text. This intertestamental texts includes Story of how many parts Adam was created from, Adam’s Handwriting, Story of the <b>Cross</b> <b>Tree,</b> Story of Adam and Eve, Adam’s Lament. In Old Russian manuscripts these texts were not necessarily clearly divided from one another, they were often copied as a single set related to the first man and woman. Author had like to look in more detail into the lament of Adam. The Old Testament says nothing about the penance and lament of Adam after his and Eve’s expulsion from Eden. However, the apocryphal Old Russian version (Confession of Eve) mentions his crying and lamenting. Another genre of the Adamic text (apart from prayer, narration, and lament) is the question-and-answer erotapocritical apocryphal literature {{in the form of}} riddles and solutions. For example, in the wellknown apocryphal ‘Talk of three Holy Hierarchs’, the text known in different versions to the southern Slavs since the 12 th century, which has a long literary tradition in Russia well into the 19 th century, there are riddles concerning Adam. The theme of Adam in Old Russian literary and oral traditions is present in several genres: narrative, spiritual verse, riddles.

40|$|Abstract. Given an undirected n-node graph {{and a set}} C of m cuts, {{the minimum}} <b>crossing</b> <b>tree</b> is a {{spanning}} tree which minimizes the maximum crossing of any cut in C, where the crossing of a cut {{is the number of}} edges in the intersection of this cut and the tree. This problem finds applications in fields as diverse as Computational Biology and IP Routing Table Minimization. We show that a greedy algorithm gives an O(r log n) approximation for the prob-lem where any edge occurs in at most r cuts. We then demonstrate that the prob-lem remains NP-hard even when G is complete. For the latter case, we design a randomized algorithm that gives a <b>tree</b> T with <b>crossing</b> O((log m + log n) · (OPT + log n)) w. h. p., where OPT is the minimum <b>crossing</b> of any <b>tree.</b> Our greedy analysis extends the traditional one used for set cover. The random-ized algorithm rounds a LP relaxation of a corresponding subproblem in stages. ...|$|R
