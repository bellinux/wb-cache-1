25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, and I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> {{other than to}} attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't {{going to make it}} back.|$|E
2500|$|Christy Mathewson {{later said}} of {{the moment when he}} took the mound at Fenway Park, [...] "This was {{the only place in the}} world that I wanted to be. [...] I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> greater than {{pitching}} this game for the glory of the New York Giants." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zuo Ci offered Cao Cao {{the books}} if Cao himself became a disciple of Taoism. Cao Cao responded, [...] "Often have I {{reflected}} upon this course and struggled against my fate, {{but what can}} I do? There is no one to maintain the government," [...] when Zuo Ci suggested Liu Bei and threatened Cao Cao, [...] " [...] I may have to send one of my flying swords after your head one day", Cao accused Zuo {{of being one of}} Liu Bei's agents, and threatened him. Zuo Ci openly mocked Cao Cao in court and Cao had him arrested; the guards beat Zuo cruelly, but the Taoist then fell asleep and slept soundly through the night. This enraged Cao Cao, who ordered Zuo Ci to be starved of food, this also failed as Zuo quite happily went seven days without food or water. After this Cao Cao <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else to punish Zuo Ci. When Zuo Ci appeared at Cao Cao's banquet, Cao tested him by asking to get, among other things, a dragon's liver, a peony, and perch from the Song River. Zuo Ci accomplished everything, which drew further suspicion from Cao Cao. Zuo Ci then offered a cup of wine to Cao Cao, who said that Zuo should taste first. Zuo Ci took a stick and divided the wine in half, and drank one half. Cao Cao was enraged.|$|E
60|$|But Dave merely {{shook his}} head. He {{was bound to}} find his father, dead or alive, {{no matter what the}} cost. For the time being he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{absolutely}} <b>nothing</b> else. That, and that alone, possessed him, heart and soul.|$|R
60|$|Maria {{took off}} her hat as suggested, and sat down meekly, full under fire of the glowing eyes that had {{produced}} such curious effects upon subjects so dissimilar as the late Mrs. Caresfoot and Jim Brady. She <b>could,</b> however, <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> appropriate to say.|$|R
60|$|And then, {{because we}} were Adam's children, with his fallen nature in us, and {{original}} sin, which we inherited from him, we could not help longing more and more after what our parents had forbidden; we <b>could</b> <b>think,</b> perhaps, <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else; cared for no pleasure, no pay, because we could not get that one thing which our parents had told us not to touch. And at last we fell, and sinned, and took the thing on the sly.|$|R
60|$|She was {{a little}} {{surprised}} at his gambit and <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> but a kindly murmur.|$|E
60|$|They <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to be done}} {{except to}} shoot the man, and to that I objected.|$|E
60|$|She <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> to say, {{and for a}} {{while they}} {{remained}} in silence. Then he got up.|$|E
60|$|As for Mrs. Cliff, {{her mind}} {{was so full of}} plans for the benefit of her native town that she <b>could</b> talk and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else, and <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} be induced to take notice of a spouting whale, which was engaging the attention of all the passengers and the crew.|$|R
60|$|But of this {{our hero}} {{said nothing to}} anyone, nor did he tell a single living soul {{what he had seen}} that night, but nursed it in his own mind, where it lay so big for a while that he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> little or <b>nothing</b> else for days after.|$|R
6000|$|First, {{watering}} the steers. Sickened {{by walking}} backward with pails of water he carried till he <b>could</b> see and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> {{in the world}} save the water-butt, the puddle in front of it, and the cattlemen mercilessly dipping out pails there, through centuries that would never end. How those steers did drink! ...|$|R
60|$|He {{kissed her}} tears away, then as he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else to say, {{asked her if}} she would marry him.|$|E
60|$|Her voice droned away. They <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> but mean economies as they trudged {{the wide}} and magic {{night of the}} moors.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Price {{gathered}} up her things slowly. Philip waited behind after {{the others to}} say to her something consolatory. He <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> but: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{explained}} to her that we must walk a little further {{to get to a}} cab-stand, unless we were fortunate enough to meet with an empty vehicle; and then tried to resume the subject of Cumberland. It was useless. That idea of shutting herself in, and being driven away, had now got full possession of her mind. She <b>could</b> <b>think</b> and talk <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else.|$|R
60|$|His only aim {{and purpose}} now was her safety. One thing {{at least he}} could do: by fair means or foul stop Leonard's mouth, so that others need not know her shame! He groaned aloud as the thought came to him. Beyond this first step he <b>could</b> do <b>nothing,</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> as yet. And he could not take this first step till Leonard had so far sobered that he could understand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had never}} hoped {{to see her}} face in all its {{brightness}} again," [...] he said. [...] "Twelve years! It is twelve years that she has suffered, and of late she has been brought to this grievous state of poverty, and yet the spirit is as brave and cheerful as ever! It looks out of the beautiful eyes--more beautiful than when I first saw them,--I <b>could</b> see and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} {{apologize}} for disturbing you {{at such an}} hour," [...] he answered, taking up his hat. [...] "I <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, as ye please," [...] {{said the}} old farmer. He was so upset {{over the loss of}} his watch he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, well, well!" [...] The shoeman {{stared in}} reverent amazement. Then, as he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> further to say, he justly observed, [...] "Well!" ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{of the men}} had rusty guns by them, {{some had}} swords on and had shawl belts with long, silver-mounted pistols stuck in them. All the camels had their loads on yet, but the packs had busted or rotted and spilt the freight out on the ground. We didn't reckon the swords was any good to the dead people any more, so we took one apiece, and some pistols. We took a small box, too, because it was so {{handsome}} and inlaid so fine; and then we wanted to bury the people; but there warn't no way to do it that we <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> and <b>nothing</b> to do it with but sand, and that would blow away again, of course.|$|R
60|$|So the Duke {{had come}} to America, where {{borrowing}} is notoriously easy. Any member of the Mausoleum Club, for instance, would borrow fifty cents to buy a cigar, or fifty thousand dollars to buy a house, or five millions to buy a railroad with complete indifference, and pay it back, too, if he <b>could,</b> and <b>think</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> it. In fact, ever {{so many of the}} Duke's friends were known to have borrowed money in America with magical ease, pledging for it their seats or their pictures, or one of their daughters--anything.|$|R
60|$|He {{had been}} trying to collect his thoughts. Would they hang him? No, they must try him first, legally, and he could prove--he could prove-- But what could he prove? For {{whenever}} he attempted to consider the uncertain chances of his escape, he found his thoughts straying wide of the question. It was of no use for him to clasp his fingers or knit his brows. Why did the recollection of a school-fellow, long since forgotten, blot out all the fierce and feverish memories of the night and the terrible certainty of the future? Why did the strips of paper hanging from the wall recall to him the pattern of a kite he had flown forty years ago. In a moment like this, when all his energies were required and all his cunning and tact would be called into service, <b>could</b> he <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> better than trying to match the torn paper on the wall, or to count the cracks in the floor? And an oath rose to his lips, but from very feebleness died away without expression.|$|R
60|$|She {{pointed to}} a writing-table and went away, while the first letters so amazed Geraldine that she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else, and hastened to summon Clement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Still, claret {{never does}} lie easy on my stomach," [...] Richard explained, intent upon blaming Lord Gervase s wine--since he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else--for his condition.|$|E
60|$|The {{excitement}} {{attending the}} disappearance of Bart Conners's stickpin and Dan Baxter's money had somewhat subsided, and now the cadets <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> but the coming election.|$|E
60|$|The most {{profound}} silence, the deepest darkness, continued to brood {{for more than}} an hour over the chapel in which we left the Knight of the Leopard still kneeling, alternately expressing thanks to Heaven and gratitude to his lady for the boon which had been vouchsafed to him. His own safety, his own destiny, for which he was at all times little anxious, had not now the weight of a grain of dust in his reflections. He was in the neighbourhood of Lady Edith; he had received tokens of her grace; he was in a place hallowed by relics of the most awful sanctity. A Christian soldier, a devoted lover, <b>could</b> fear <b>nothing,</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing,</b> but his duty to Heaven and his devoir to his lady.|$|R
60|$|The {{great thing}} was to admit no one save those earnest spirits who would aspire {{to get the full}} benefit from their studies. Mrs. Fortescue could not be thought of, she was much too talkative. And Mrs. Jones had such a {{frivolous}} mind. Mrs. Charles <b>could</b> <b>think</b> and talk <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> but her servants. And Mrs. Patt-Beatson always wanted to lay down the law. Perhaps on the whole {{it would be better to}} start the society quietly among themselves, and then gradually to increase it. The first meeting should be next Wednesday, at Mrs. Crosse's house, and Mrs. Hunt Mortimer would bring her complete two- volume edition with her. Mrs. Beecher thought that one volume would be enough just at first, but Mrs. Hunt Mortimer said that it was better to have a wide choice. Maude went home and told Frank in the evening. He was pleased, but rather sceptical.|$|R
60|$|When {{the mother}} and son had leisure to look round, {{and there was a}} pleased survey of the boy's height and strength, Goodwife Dolly came forward to beg the lady to come to her fire, and rest under the gipsy tent which she and nephew Piers--her real herd-boy, a rough, shaggy, almost dumb and {{imbecile}} lad--had raised with branches, skins and canvas, to protect their few articles of property. There was a smouldering fire, over which Doll had prepared a rabbit which the dog had caught, and which she had intended for Hal's supper and that of her husband if he came home in time. While the lady lavished thanks upon her for all she had done for the boy she was intent on improving the rude meal, so as to strengthen her mistress after her long walk, and for the return. The lady, however, <b>could</b> see and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> but her son, while he returned her tearful gaze with open eyes, gathering up his old recollections of her.|$|R
60|$|For {{some days}} Mr. Britling <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> but Hugh, and always {{with a dull}} pain at his heart. He felt as he had felt long ago while he had waited downstairs and Hugh upstairs had been under the knife of a surgeon. But this time the {{operation}} went on and still went on. At the worst his boy had but one chance in five of death or serious injury, but for a time he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> but that one chance. He felt it pressing upon his mind, pressing him down....|$|E
60|$|Aunt Dorcas was not {{satisfied}} with this arrangement; but she <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> better just then, and appeared determined {{there should be no}} further discussion on the subject.|$|E
60|$|Felix was silent. He {{looked at}} his {{opponent}} with unwilling admiration; the man after all, then, was great. For the moment he <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> whatever to say.|$|E
60|$|And yet he did {{not really}} believe, as he should have done, that it was impossible. He should have known her well enough to feel that it was truly impossible. He should have been aware that Eleanor had that within her which would surely protect her from such degradation. But he, like so many others, was {{deficient}} in confidence in woman. He said to himself {{over and over again}} that it was impossible that Eleanor Bold should become Mrs. Slope, and yet he believed that she would do so. And so he rambled about, and <b>could</b> do and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing.</b> He was thoroughly uncomfortable, thoroughly ill at ease, cross with himself and everybody else, and feeding in his heart on animosity towards Mr. Slope. This was not as it should be, as he knew and felt, but he could not help himself. In truth Mr. Arabin was now in love with Mrs. Bold, though ignorant of the fact himself. He was in love and, though forty years old, was in love without being aware of it. He fumed and fretted and did not know what was the matter, as a youth might do at one-and-twenty. And so having done no good at St. Ewold's, he rode back much earlier than was usual with him, instigated by some inward, unacknowledged hope that he might see Mrs. Bold before she left.|$|R
60|$|Yes, death. Why {{should he}} die? No! Better solitude, better hopeless waiting, alone. Alone. No! {{he was not}} alone, he saw death looking at him from everywhere; from the bushes, from the clouds--he heard her {{speaking}} {{to him in the}} murmur of the river, filling the space, touching his heart, his brain with a cold hand. He <b>could</b> see and <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> else. He saw it--the sure death--everywhere. He saw it so close that he was always on the point of throwing out his arms to keep it off. It poisoned all he saw, all he did; the miserable food he ate, the muddy water he drank; it gave a frightful aspect to sunrises and sunsets, to the brightness of hot noon, to the cooling shadows of the evenings. He saw the horrible form among the big trees, in the network of creepers in the fantastic outlines of leaves, of the great indented leaves that seemed to be so many enormous hands with big broad palms, with stiff fingers outspread to lay hold of him; hands gently stirring, or hands arrested in a frightful immobility, with a stillness attentive and watching for the opportunity to take him, to enlace him, to strangle him, to hold him till he died; hands that would hold him dead, that would never let go, that would cling to his body for ever till it perished--disappeared in their frantic and tenacious grasp.|$|R
60|$|His {{heart was}} moved, {{softened}} with pity {{at his own}} abandonment. His anger against her, against her who {{was the cause of}} all his misfortunes, vanished before his extreme need for some kind of consolation. Perhaps--if he must resign himself to his fate--she might help him to forget. To forget! For a moment, in an access of despair so profound that it seemed like the beginning of peace, he planned the deliberate descent from his pedestal, the throwing away of his superiority, of all his hopes, of old ambitions, of the ungrateful civilization. For a moment, forgetfulness in her arms seemed possible; and lured by that possibility the semblance of renewed desire possessed his breast in a burst of reckless contempt for everything outside himself--in a savage disdain of Earth and of Heaven. He said to himself that he would not repent. The punishment for his only sin was too heavy. There was no mercy under Heaven. He did not want any. He thought, desperately, that if he could find with her again the madness of the past, the strange delirium that had changed him, that had worked his undoing, he would be ready to pay for it with an eternity of perdition. He was intoxicated by the subtle perfumes of the night; he was carried away by the suggestive stir of the warm breeze; he was possessed by the exaltation of the solitude, of the silence, of his memories, in the presence of that figure offering herself in a submissive and patient devotion; coming to him {{in the name of the}} past, in the name of those days when he <b>could</b> see <b>nothing,</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing,</b> desire nothing--but her embrace.|$|R
