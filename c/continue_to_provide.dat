5|$|Before {{the advent}} of the European system of {{education}} in Mysore, agraharas (Brahmin quarters) provided Vedic education to Hindus, and madrassas provided schooling for Muslims. Modern education began in Mysore when a free English school was established in 1833. Maharaja's College was founded in 1864. A high school exclusively for girls was established in 1881 and was later renamed Maharani's Women's College. The Industrial School, the first institute for technical education in the city, was established in 1892; this was followed by the Chamarajendra Technical Institute in 1913. While the modern system of education have makde inroads, colleges such as the Mysore Sanskrit Pāthaśhāla, established in 1876, still <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> Vedic education.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the US Government Accountability Office said a {{shortage}} of lithium-7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “places their ability to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> electricity at some risk”. The problem stems from the decline of US nuclear infrastructure. The equipment needed to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7 is mostly a cold war leftover. The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963, when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. The report {{said it would take}} five years and $10 million to $12 million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7.|$|E
5|$|In human culture, domesticated mammals {{played a}} major role in the Neolithic revolution, causing farming to replace hunting and gathering, and leading to a major {{restructuring}} of human societies with the first civilizations. They provided, and <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide,</b> power for transport and agriculture, as well as various commodities such as meat, dairy products, wool, and leather. Mammals are hunted or raced for sport, and are used as model organisms in science. Mammals have been depicted in art since Palaeolithic times, and appear in literature, film, mythology, and religion. Defaunation of mammals is primarily driven by anthropogenic factors, such as poaching and habitat destruction, though there are efforts to combat this.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these duties, forensic anthropologists often assist {{in the investigation of}} war crimes and mass fatality investigations.

Anthropologists have also helped identify victims of genocide in countries around the world, often long after the actual event. War crimes anthropologists have helped investigate include the Rwandan Genocide and the Srebrenica Genocide.
