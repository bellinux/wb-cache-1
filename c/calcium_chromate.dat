40|$|The {{speciation}} {{and distribution}} of Cr(VI) in the solid phase was investigated for two types of chromite ore processing residue (COPR) found at two deposition sites in the United States: gray-black (GB) granular and hard brown (HB) cemented COPR. COPR chemistry and mineralogy were investigated using micro-X-ray absorption spectroscopy and micro-X-ray diffraction, complemented by laboratory analyses. GB COPR contained 30 percent of its total Cr(VI) (6000 mg/kg) as large crystals(> 20 ?m diameter) of a previously unreported Na-rich analog of <b>calcium</b> aluminum <b>chromate</b> hydrates. These Cr(VI) -rich phases {{are thought to be}} vulnerable to reductive and pH treatments. More than 50 percent of the Cr(VI) was located within nodules, not easily accessible to dissolved reductants, and bound to Fe-rich hydrogarnet, hydrotalcite, and possibly brucite. These phases are stable over a large pH range, thus harder to dissolve. Brownmilleritewasalso likely associated with physical entrapment of Cr(VI) in the interior of nodules. HB COPR contained no Cr(VI) -rich phases; all Cr(VI) was diffuse within the nodules and absent from the cementing matrix, with hydrogarnet and hydrotalcite being the main Cr(VI) binding phases.

40|$|OVER {{a period}} of 15 years, we have {{investigated}} (at {{the request of the}} chromates-producing industry in Great Britain) the carcinogenicity of several different chromium-containing compounds by the technique of single or repeated intramuscular injection in rats and/or mice.

40|$|The {{standard}} Gibbs {{free energies}} of formation of calcium chromite and <b>calcium</b> <b>chromate</b> have been determined employing solid state galvanic cells Pt, Cr + CaO + CaCr_ 20 _ 4 ThO_ 2 (Y_ 20 _ 3) Cr + Cr_ 20 _ 3, Pt in the temperature interval 1050 ≤ T ≤ 1475 K and Pt, 0 _ 2, CaO + CaF_ 2 CaF_ 2 CaF_ 2 + Cr_ 20 _ 3 + CaCrO_ 4, 0 _ 2, Pt for 870 ≤ T ≤ 1100 K. <b>Calcium</b> <b>chromate</b> (CaCrO_ 4) {{was found to}} be unstable in contact with Cr_ 20 _ 3 and O_ 2 (1. 01 × l 0 ^ 5 Pa) at T > 1125 K. The reversibility of the EMF was confirmed by microcoulometric titration. The temperature dependence of the standard Gibbs energy of formation of the ternary oxides can be represented by the equations CaO (r. s.) + Cr_ 20 _ 3 (cor.) → CaCr_ 20 _ 4 (β), Δ G^o = - 60, 970 - 11. 29 T (± 350) J mo 1 ^- 1, and CaO (r. s.) + 1 / 2 Cr_ 20 _ 3 (cor.) + 3 / 4 O_ 2 (g) → CaCrO_ 4 (zir.)

40|$|Corrosion {{field tests}} {{have been carried}} out in the {{superheater}} region of a commercial waste-fired 75 MW CFBC boiler using air cooled probes. Exposure time was 24 and 1000 hours. The effect of adding sulphur to the fuel on the corrosion of two high alloyed steels and a low alloyed steel was studied. The fuel consisted of 50 % household waste and 50 % industrial waste. The exposed samples were analyzed by ESEM/EDX and XRD. Metal loss was determined after 1000 hours. Both materials suffered significant corrosion in the absence of sulphur addition and the addition of sulphur to the fuel reduced corrosion significantly. The rapid corrosion of the high alloyed steel in the absence of sulphur addition is caused by the destruction of the chromium-containing protective oxide by formation of <b>calcium</b> <b>chromate.</b> Adding sulphur to the fuel inhibited chromate formation and increased the sulphate/chloride ratio in the deposit.

40|$|Four {{hexavalent}} and two trivalent chromium compounds {{were tested}} for toxicity and mutagenicity {{by means of}} the Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian-microsome test. All hexavalent compounds yielded a complete inhibition of bacterial growth at doses of 400 to 800 μg/plate, a significant increase of his+ revertant colonies at doses ranging from 10 to 200 μg, and no effect at doses of less than 10 μg. The distinctive sensitivity of the four Salmonella strains tested (TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 98, and TA 100) suggested that hexavalent chromium directly interacts with bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid by causing both frameshift mutations and basepair substitutions. The latter mutations, which are prevalent, are amplified by an error-prone recombinational repair of the damaged deoxyribonucleic acid. On the average, 1 μmol of hexavalent chromium yielded approximately 500 revertants of the TA 100 strain, irrespective of the compound tested (sodium dichromate, <b>calcium</b> <b>chromate,</b> potassium chromate, or chromic acid). The mutagenic potency of the hexavalent metal was not enhanced by adding the microsomal fraction of rat hepatocytes, induced either with sodium barbital or with Aroclor 1254.

The principal aim {{of the study was}} to extend our knowledge of the carcinogenic potential of chromium compounds and, in particular, chromates (Cr 6 +). A statistically significant incidence of treatment related lung tumours was found with some sparingly soluble chromate materials. All tumours were large keratinizing squamous carcinomas of the left lung, except for a single left lung adenocarcinoma and two left lung anaplastic carcinomas. No bronchial carcinomas (0 / 100) were seen in the negative control group (blank pellet loaded with cholesterol), whereas bronchial carcinomas (22 / 48 and 25 / 100) occurred in the two positive control groups which received pellets loaded with 20 -methylcholanthrene and <b>calcium</b> <b>chromate</b> respectively. Among the 20 test materials, only three groups gave statistically significant numbers of bronchial carcinomas. Two of these were groups receiving different samples of strontium chromate which gave 43 / 99 and 62 / 99 tumours. The third group, zinc chromate (low solubility), gave 5 / 100 bronchial carcinomas.

40|$|Slag arising in {{ferrochromium}} and {{stainless steel}} production is known to contain residual levels of trivalent chromium. As the chromium is normally bound in the slag matrix in various silicate or spinel phases, and hence not easily mobilised, utilisation or controlled disposal of such slag is generally considered unproblematic. Experimental test work {{with a number of}} slag materials indicates, however, that very gradual oxidation of trivalent to hexavalent chromium does occur when the slag is exposed to atmospheric oxygen, rendering a quantifiable but small portion of chromium in this much more mobile and toxic form. Mechanisms and rates of the oxidation reaction were investigated in a number of long-term studies using both original slag materials and artificial mixes of chromium and calcium oxides. Powders of these materials, some of them rolled into balls, were left to age under different conditions for periods of up to 12 months. In the slag samples, which contained between 1 and 3 wt. % chromium, 1000 – 10 000 μg Cr(VI) were found per gram of chromium within 6 – 9 months of exposure to an ambient atmosphere. The rate of the oxidation reaction decreased exponentially, and the reaction could generally be said to have ceased within 12 months. In mixtures of calcium and chromium oxides the oxidation reaction is presumed to occur at the boundaries between chromium oxide and calcium oxide phases through diffusion of oxygen along the grain boundaries and of Cr 3 + across the boundaries, resulting in the formation of <b>calcium</b> <b>chromate.</b> In the slags, where calcium and chromium oxide can form a solid solution, the oxidation is likely to occur at the exposed surface of grains containing this solution...|$|E
