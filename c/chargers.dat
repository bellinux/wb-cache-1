5|$|Before the 1988 San Diego <b>Chargers</b> season began, Dan Fouts {{chose to}} retire from the game after 15 seasons, leaving Vlasic as the main backup to starter Mark Herrmann, {{and as a result}} the <b>Chargers</b> began trying to trade for an {{experienced}} quarterback.

In November, after Laufenberg was injured, the <b>Chargers</b> decided to make Vlasic the starter instead of Malone due to the latter's ineffectiveness, as well as a six-game losing streak. He made his season debut against the Atlanta Falcons on November 13, and threw for 190 yards in a 107 victory. As a result of his performance, coach Al Saunders said that Vlasic would have the starting job {{for the rest of the}} season. Vlasic's second start came against the Los Angeles Rams where he threw for 80 yards and a touchdown. However, he suffered torn ligaments in his left knee late in the third quarter, and was lost for the season. He finished the season with 25 of 52 passes completed and a passer rating of 54.2.|$|E
