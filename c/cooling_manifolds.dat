40|$|The current design {{environment}} {{dictates that}} high technology CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analysis produce quality {{results in a}} timely manner {{if it is to be}} integrated into the design process. The design methodology outlined describes the CFD analysis of an NLS (National Launch System) nozzle film <b>cooling</b> <b>manifold.</b> The objective of the analysis was to obtain a qualitative estimate for the flow distribution within the manifold. A complex, 3 D, multiple zone, structured grid was generated from a 3 D CAD file of the geometry. A Euler solution was computed with a fully implicit compressible flow solver. Post processing consisted of full 3 D color graphics and mass averaged performance. The result was a qualitative CFD solution that provided the design team with relevant information concerning the flow distribution in and performance characteristics of the film <b>cooling</b> <b>manifold</b> within an effective time frame. Also, this design methodology was the foundation for a quick turnaround CFD analysis of the next iteration in the manifold design...|$|R
40|$|To provide uniform cooling for a {{fuel cell}} stack, a cooling plate concept was evaluated. This concept {{utilized}} thin cooling plates to extract heat from the interior of {{a fuel cell}} stack and move this heat to a <b>cooling</b> <b>manifold</b> where it can be transferred to an external cooling fluid. The advantages of this cooling approach include a reduced number of ancillary components and the ability to directly utilize an external cooling fluid loop for cooling the fuel cell stack. A number of different types of <b>cooling</b> plates and <b>manifolds</b> were developed. The cooling plates consisted of two main types; a plate based on thermopyrolytic graphite (TPG) and a planar (or flat plate) heat pipe. The plates, along with solid metal control samples, were tested for both thermal and electrical conductivity. To transfer heat from the cooling plates to the cooling fluid, a number of manifold designs utilizing various materials were devised, constructed, and tested. A key aspect of the manifold was {{that it had to be}} electrically nonconductive so it would not short out the fuel cell stack during operation. Different <b>manifold</b> and <b>cooling</b> plate configurations were tested in a vacuum chamber to minimize convective heat losses. Cooling plates were placed in the grooves within the manifolds and heated with surface-mounted electric pad heaters. The plate temperature and its thermal distribution were recorded for all tested combinations of <b>manifold</b> <b>cooling</b> flow rates and heater power loads. This testing simulated the performance of the <b>cooling</b> plates and <b>manifold</b> within an operational fuel cell stack. Different types of control valves and control schemes were tested and evaluated based on their ability to maintain a constant temperature of the cooling plates. The control valves regulated the cooling fluid flow through the manifold, thereby controlling the heat flow to the cooling fluid. Through this work, a <b>cooling</b> plate and <b>manifold</b> system was developed that could maintain the cooling plates within a minimal temperature band with negligible thermal gradients over power profiles that would be experienced within an operating fuel cell stack...|$|R

The design {{has been successfully}} implemented at the University of Michigan, Howard University, Bell Laboratories-Lucent Technologies Collaborative Access Team (MHATT-CAT) 7 ID Beamline of the Advanced Photon Source. Before {{the installation of the}} new crystal mount, our Si (lll) cryogenically cooled monochromator was sensitive to the pressure fluctuations of the liquid nitrogen coolant, such that the angle of incidence on the first crystal varied linearly with the applied pressure in the cooling lines, causing beam motion of about 250  μm,  60  m 250 μm, 60 m from the source.

Proposed designs feature either a Brayton or a K-Rankine power conversion cycle to drive a turbine coupled with rotary alternators. Both ion and magnetoplasmodynamic (MPD) thrusters will be considered in the model. In support of the NEP model, Rocketdyne is developing power conversion, heat rejection, and power management and distribution (PMAD) subroutines. The subroutines will be incorporated into the NEP vehicle model which will be written by NASA LeRC. The purpose is to document the heat pipe cooled heat rejection subsystem model and its supporting subroutines. The heat pipe cooled heat rejection subsystem model is designed to provide estimate of the mass and performance of the equipment used to reject heat from Brayton and Rankine cycle power conversion systems. The subroutine models the ductwork and heat pipe <b>cooled</b> <b>manifold</b> for a gas cooled Brayton; the heat sink heat exchanger, liquid loop piping, expansion compensator, pump and manifold for a liquid loop cooled Brayton; and a shear flow condenser for a K-Rankine system.

This paper describes the design and presents commissioning results of the RF system for the booster synchrotron. Booster RF commissioning took place in late 2005 and early 2006 and involved the setting-into-operation of a 60 kW IOT amplifier, supplied by Thales Broadcast and Multimedia, a 5 -cell copper cavity, manufactured by Accel Instruments, and a low-level RF system designed and built by Sincrotrone Trieste. THE BOOSTER CAVITY The accelerating cavity chosen for the booster of the Diamond Light Source is a copper structure of the PETRA type, manufactured by Accel Instruments [1]. Figure 1 is a photograph of the cavity installed in the booster. Figure 1 : Booster cavity. The cavity is a 5 -cell structure with frequency tuning plungers mounted on cells 2 and 4. A water and air-cooled high-power coupler is mounted on cell 3 and the cavity is pumped by two 300 l/s ion pumps on cells 1 and 5. The coaxial transmission line and coupler are in the foreground of figure 1 and the tuning plungers are behind the <b>cooling</b> <b>manifold</b> under the cavity. There are four pick-up loops in the cavity with a nominal sensitivity of 44. 8 dB, and two full-range Pirani/IMG pressure gauge pairs.

40|$|Embedding of {{internal}} microchannel into a standard cutting tool alters the thermal and mechanical behaviours {{of the tool}} in a machining process which consequently improves the machining performance in terms of wear mechanisms of the tool and surface roughness of the finished product. Obviously conditions of the fluid such as type, temperature, viscosities and speed need to be modelled accurately to determine their effects on the microfluidics performance although the development of ideal mathematical equations to precisely pose a machining process is almost impossible due to the geometrical, physical, thermal and chemical complexities of the process. This work aims at computational fluid dynamics modelling of the internal flow inside the microchannel of 0. 8 m diameter to quantify the flow regimes along the <b>cooling</b> <b>manifold</b> for improving {{the performance of a}} cutting tool. Two procedures have been performed in this work, namely (1) the determination of flow regimes in the internal microchannel and (2) the mapping of the flow speed topography of the cooling fluid. The fluid in this analysis is assumed to be Newtonian incompressible fluid since it will not change phase while exchanging the heat. The results show that the Reynolds Number in the microchannel manifold are distributed in the range of 528 and 6604 which the numbers higher than 2320 are considered turbulent flow. On the other hand, the empirical correlations show that with the inlet flow rate of 0. 3 l/min, the fluid speed at the microchannel part that is closest to heated region can reach up to 7. 706 m/min. The outcomes of this work determine the pump capacity of the system and the values obtained from the numerical analysis can be used in the thermodynamics analysis of the cooling performance of the microchannel in removing the heat generated during machining...|$|R

Discs are then joint together by diffusion bonding. The rest of important technical systems, such as vacuum, <b>cooling</b> and <b>manifolds,</b> to house damping silicon carbide absorbers, are brazed to the bonded disc stack afterwards. This manufacturing technique has been successfully demonstrated {{but it is very}} challenging and needs an accurate assembly at every production step. Main issues concern vacuum-tightness, misalignment, deformations during different assembly operations, defects of braz-ing/bonding operations (gaps, a leak of brazing material) etc. Preparation and repairs are time and resource con-suming and increase the final price of the accelerating structure.

50|$|Applying carb heat as {{a matter}} of routine is built into {{numerous}} in-flight and pre-landing checks (e.g. see BUMPH and GUMPS). In long descents, carb heat may be used continuously to prevent icing buildup; with the throttle closed there is a large pressure (and therefore temperature) drop in the carburetor which can cause rapid ice buildup that could go unnoticed because engine power is not used. In addition, the exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>cools</b> considerably when power is removed, so if carb icing occurs there may not be heat sufficient to remove it. Thus most operational checklists call for the routine application of carb heat whenever the throttle is closed in flight.|$|R
40|$|Many new {{technologies}} {{are being developed}} to improve the fuel consumption of gasoline engines, including the combination of direct fuel injection with turbocharging in a so-called 'downsizing' approach. In such spark ignition engines operating on the Otto cycle, downsizing targets {{a shift in the}} operating map such that the engine is dethrottled to a greater extent during normal operation, thus reducing pumping losses and improving fuel consumption. However, even with direct injection, the need for turbine protection fuelling at high load in turbocharged engines-which is important for customer usage on faster European highways such as German Autobahns-brings a fuel consumption penalty over a naturally-aspirated engine in this mode of operation. In addition to the continual increase in permissible turbine inlet temperature that metallurgical development has provided, both <b>cooled</b> exhaust <b>manifolds</b> and the use of diluents (principally cooled EGR) have been shown to reduce the need for high-load component protection fuelling. This paper reports test work performed using a state-of-the-art 1. 5 litre close-spaced direct injection turbocharged engine, fitted as standard with an exhaust manifold integrated into the cylinder head, aimed at exploring any synergies from combining this base engine technology with increased turbine inlet temperature or cooled EGR...|$|R

We then apply the method with the manifold defined by the log barrier function to the problems of (1) uniformly sampling a polytope and (2) computing its volume, the latter by extending Gaussian <b>cooling</b> to the <b>manifold</b> setting. In both cases, the total number of steps needed is O^*(mn^ 2 / 3), improving the state of the art.

Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas <b>manifold</b> <b>cooling</b> system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|R
5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas <b>manifold</b> <b>cooling</b> circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants.

The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|R

The combination of a high gas flow requirement and small gas volumes yield unfavourable properties in terms of control stability. Early experiments on a prototype of the final cooling system, showed that pressure losses in the gas distribution lines must be decreased to fulfil the pressure control requirements. One part of this note is devoted to a cfd analysis of a critical component, an elbow duct, in the gas distribution line. To enable analyses of the overall cooling system dynamics, generic simulation components were created and applied in a simulation of the prototype cooling system.

5000|$|A {{crossflow}} head gives {{better performance}} than a Reverse-flow cylinder head (though {{not as good}} as a uniflow), but the popular explanation put forward for this [...] - [...] that the gases don't have to change direction and hence are moved {{into and out of the}} cylinder more efficiently [...] - [...] is a simplification since there is no continuous flow because of valve opening and closing. But since there is overlap between the intake and exhaust profiles there is a point in which both valves are open. At that point the inertia of the exhaust gases leaving the cylinder helps to aspirate the intake gases into the cylinder. The other main reason for a crossflow's performance is that the ports and valves can be larger and its physical separation of the hot exhaust manifold keeps the air in the intake <b>manifold</b> <b>cooler.</b> Most modern engines are of a crossflow design. The engineering terminology for these benefits is greater volumetric efficiency.|$|R

40|$|Using {{classical}} Monte Carlo simulations, {{we study}} a simple statistical mechanical model of {{relevance to the}} emergence of polarisation from local displacements on the square and cubic lattices. Our model contains two key ingredients: a Kitaev-like orientation-dependent interaction between nearest neighbours, and a steric term that acts between next-nearest neighbours. Taken by themselves, each of these two ingredients is incapable of driving long-range symmetry breaking, despite the presence of a broad feature in the corresponding heat capacity functions. Instead each component results in a "hidden" transition on <b>cooling</b> to a <b>manifold</b> of degenerate states, the two manifolds are different {{in the sense that they}} reflect distinct types of local order. Remarkably, their intersection [...] -i. e. the ground state when both interaction terms are included in the Hamiltonian [...] -supports a spontaneous polarisation.

The manifold, {{also referred to as}} a "header", is one of four to be embedded in the bottom of Lake Michigan approximately 3500 ft offshore from the James H. Campbell Plant. Each header supports and collects water from seven dual screen intake risers (subject of a separate study). The primary objective {{of the study was to}} determine flow contribution from each of seven risers and piezometric pressures along the header. It was found that the flow rates ranged from 92 percent to 112 percent of the average flow per riser. To achieve a higher degree of uniformity, an analysis was made to determine how much additional headloss had to, be generated in each intake riser in order to produce identical withdrawal rates in all seven risers. A similar study was. Made for a partially balanced system where withdrawal rates would not fall outside the 95 to 105 percent limits. In that case, headloss generators were required in the two most downstream risers. Sharp edged nozzles were designed for Risers 6 and 7, and experimentally tested.

40|$|The {{efficient}} cooling of servers in {{data center}} offers a unique challenge {{to reduce the}} worldwide energy consumption and liquid inventory of working fluid. Presently, single phase cooling techniques are widely used for CPU cooling in data centers. Such techniques are proving to be inefficient, as the heat flux generated in CPU cores is very high, limiting the clock speed of the processors. Also, single phase coolers require external pumping power adding cost to the system. The great potential of a thermosiphon system as a replacement of currently used cooling techniques is studied in the presented work. A thermosiphon loop using two-phase heat and mass transfer process uses latent heat of the working fluid. The latent heat is much more efficient than sensible heat improving the heat dissipation ability of the system. The thermosiphon system is a gravity driven loop thus reducing the power consumption {{and the cost of}} the system. However, the system performance is limited by Critical Heat Flux (CHF) and Heat Transfer Coefficients (HTC). An increase in CHF offers wide temperature operating range while the HTC defines the efficiency of the process. In the proposed design of the <b>cooling</b> solution, a <b>manifold</b> with a taper is employed over the heater surface to guide vapor away from the surface along the flow length. The incoming liquid flows over the heating surface unobstructed developing separate liquid-vapor pathways. Two taper angles, 3. 4 ᵒ and 6 ᵒ in the manifold are tested for the benchtop configuration of the thermosiphon loop. A heat transfer coefficient of 27. 3 kW/m 2 ᵒC and 33. 4 kW/m 2 ᵒC was achieved for 3. 4 ᵒ and 6 ᵒ taper angles respectively.
