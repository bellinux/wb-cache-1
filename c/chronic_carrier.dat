After comparing these ALT and AST abnormal patients with other ALT and AST normal <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers,</b> no statistical difference was observed in the OD values of the anti-HBe (p> 0. 05). The ELISA results showed the anti-HBc IgG subclass pattern was IgG 1 > IgG 3 > IgG 4 in <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> and IgG 3 > IgG 1 > IgG 4 in recovered individuals (p < 0. 05).

However, in spite of the different anti-HBc IgG 1 /IgG 3 patterns demonstrated in different populations, both anti-HBc IgG 1 and IgG 3 concentrations were significantly higher in <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> (p < 0. 05).

We aimed to evaluate the viral DNA in biological fluids of chronic hepatitis patients compared to a control group. Methods: The current case-control {{study was designed to}} evaluate the viral DNA in biological fluids of 70 chronic hepatitis patients compared to a control group using ELISA, PCR and Real Time. Results: All individuals (100 %) in case group were HBsAg positive while in control group only 2 individuals (2. 8 %) were HBsAg positive. Three individuals, in control group were positive using PCR and Real Time PCR indicating that about 7 % of those in control group were <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> of HBV. The interesting point was the copy of viral DNA; (5. 49 × 104, 2. 162 × 103 and 7. 26 × 106) for 3 <b>chronic</b> <b>carriers</b> using sera while it was about (5. 71 × 103, 1. 45 × 102 and 2. 56 × 105) using ear cerumen confirming the necessity of investigating for the carriers of HBV in different biological fluid and by different methods.

5000|$|Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV are {{classical}} {{examples of}} blood-borne disease. Unlike Hepatitis A, which is spread by the fecal-oral route and {{is indicative of}} a breakdown in food safety or potable water protection, Hepatitis B, C and HIV are spread by contact with bodily fluids, most frequently blood, although {{in the case of}} HIV, not exclusively so. Also, unlike Hepatitis A in which the sufferer almost always recovers completely, or rarely dies, both Hepatitis B and C give rise to <b>chronic</b> <b>carrier</b> state and indolent disease in many. At present, Hepatitis C is the commonest reason for liver transplantation in the US while HIV is currently incurable although its clinical course can be modified. In any case, between them, they have changed awareness of infectious disease in sports, and certainly changed management on the playing surface. Ironically, evidence for transmission of any of the three as a result of injury and/or contact on the playing surface is exceedingly limited and the greatest risk to the athlete surrounds behavior that may take place off court. A case report in 1982 described 5 of 10 members of a Japanese high school sumo wrestling club who contracted hepatitis. It was hypothesized that spread had occurred through skin cuts and abrasions. An outbreak of HBV in an American football team was reported in 2000. Eleven of 65 athletes were found to be HBV positive in a 19-month surveillance period. Contact with open wounds of an HBV carrier was again hypothesized. Interestingly, both of those case reports originated in Japan. HBV transmission has been estimated to be 50 to 100 times more likely than the risk of transmission of HIV. HBV is also more environmentally stable, is resistant to alcohol and some detergents, and to be capable of surviving on environmental surfaces for more than seven days. [...] The risk of transmission in sport has been estimated at between one transmission in every 10,000 to 50,000 games to one transmission in every 850,000 to 4.25 million games. [...] These calculations are based on the estimated prevalence of HBV among athletes and it should be appreciated that aggressive and successful HBV immunization programs have been promoted since.
