5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{deciphering}} of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe {{would have been able to}} write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.|$|E

2500|$|According to Gershon Baskin, {{who helped}} mediate with Hamas for Gilad Shalit's release {{but did not}} speak to Jabari directly, Jabari had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> {{continuing}} hostilities with Israel harmed both Hamas {{and the people of}} the Gaza Strip, and had worked to prevent on several occasions Hamas rocket attacks on Israel. When such Hamas rocket attacks took place, they were intentionally aimed to land in open spaces. Baskin also said that Jabari [...] "was in line to die, not an angel and not a righteous man of peace." [...] Baskin also claimed that Jabari received a draft of a long-term ceasefire agreement with Israel only hours prior to his assassination.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{introduction}} of her retrospective collection Bone Dance (1994), she states that, [...] "the personal is political." [...] As scholar David Perron so eloquently puts it: [...] “We <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the diversity of Rose's poetry is not about distinctions, but about wholeness. Her contempt for the [...] "whiteshaman" [...] {{is out of the}} lack of wholeness which they represent, a wholeness which she has struggled to define in herself and her work. As she was struggling to find her identity within her mixed lineage and culture, using poetry to express herself, the [...] "whiteshaman" [...] simply stole from her culture. As her poetry bespeaks the position of injustice, the [...] "whiteshaman" [...] spoke from a privileged position. Thus, as difficult as it is to summarize the works of Wendy Rose, her writings on [...] "whiteshamanism" [...] bring together different strands of themes that appear throughout her poetry.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Prenatal cocaine {{exposure}} (PCE), theorized in the 1970s, {{occurs when}} a pregnant woman uses cocaine and thereby exposes her fetus to the drug. [...] "Crack baby" [...] was a term coined to describe children {{who were exposed to}} crack (freebase cocaine in smokable form) as fetuses; the concept of the crack baby emerged in the US during the 1980s and 1990s {{in the midst of a}} crack epidemic. Other terms are [...] "cocaine baby" [...] and [...] "crack kid". [...] Early studies reported that people who had been exposed to crack in utero would be severely emotionally, mentally, and physically disabled; this belief became common in the scientific and lay communities. Fears were widespread that a generation of crack babies were going to put severe strain on society and social services as they grew up. Later studies failed to substantiate the findings of earlier ones that PCE has severe disabling consequences; these earlier studies had been methodologically flawed (e.g. with small sample sizes and confounding factors). Scientists have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> the findings of the early studies were vastly overstated and that most people who were exposed to cocaine in utero do not have disabilities.|$|E
