40|$|An {{analysis}} of the choice between conduit loans and traditional whole loans in commercial mortgages. The author compares conduit and whole loan programs, and discusses their differences {{and the effects of}} information technology on the mortgage choice problem. <b>Conduit</b> <b>lending</b> produces a more volatile source of funding in posted loan rates and more stability in terms of capital availability. The specific loan program characteristics associated with <b>conduit</b> <b>lending</b> are the greater ease of accessing loan program information, faster loan closing and broader selection. The longer-run implications are that higher quality borrowers will eventually disintermediate mortgage brokers due to improvements in information technology. This suggests that there will be fewer brokers working more efficiently with a larger number of borrowers. Consequently, deep as opposed to broad service provision is the inevitable result of advancing information technology and internet-based transactions. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{portfolio}} lenders often faced {{a decision}} to hold for investment or sell newly– originated commercial mortgages, conduit lenders originated loans exclusively for sale into securitization markets. In so doing, conduit lenders may have alleviated a “lemon’s problem ” in selection of loans for sale in secondary markets, resulting in reduced mortgage risk premia and improved pricing of conduit commercial mortgage loans. In this paper, we investigate the adverse selection hypothesis, via modeling and empirical evaluation of pricing of conduit- versus portfolio-backed commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) and loans. We construct an information economics model of <b>conduit</b> <b>lending.</b> Theoretical results indicate that <b>conduit</b> <b>lending</b> helped to resolve asymmetric information problems so as to mitigate “lemon’s discounts ” in sales of portfolio loans in CMBS markets. Our empirical analyses of 141 CMBS deals and 16, 760 CMBS loans show that upon controlling for well-established determinants of loan pricing, conduit loans enjoyed a 30 bps pricing advantage over portfolio loans in the CMBS market. Empirical results are robust to alternative model specifications. Results suggest the importance of mitigation of lemon’s problems associated with loan sales to re-structuring of securitization markets. I...|$|R

3000|$|The author’s {{opportunity}} to participate in the Wenzhou Private Lending Registration Service Center’s pilot program was due to his participation in an earlier project, the “financial innovation research in Q City (a subordinate county-level city of Wenzhou) in Zhejiang Province” in July 2009. This research found that county-level governments had very limited power to reform the local financial system; market access reform and the reform of interest rate marketization in the banking sector had to be approved by the central government. What is more, civil lending behavior was limited to individual lending at that time, and most of the individual lending occurred between relatives and friends. In individual lending, the volume of loans was often constrained. After analyzing the above results, the research team suggested that direct lending between strangers via local governments could be an innovative move for local financial systems.

The main thread throughout is the legal concerns faced by lenders when lending to a company incorporated in England and Wales which operates across the European Union and has assets and creditors spread across various Member States. The initial stages of the structuring of a cross-border security arrangement in terms of the enforceability of the <b>lending</b> <b>transaction</b> and underlying security interest under the ordinary civil/commercial law outside of bankruptcy are considered. The potential contractual and proprietary issues faced by lenders are discussed through the lens of English domestic law which for the present purposes includes EU law such as the Brussels I and Rome I Regulations. After ascertaining how lenders can ensure their <b>lending</b> <b>transactions</b> and underlying security interests are valid and enforceable prebankruptcy, the thesis explores the position of lenders in the face of insolvency proceedings and the issue of 'insolvency effects'. The thesis then goes on to analyze the impact of the EC Regulation on insolvency proceedings (the EIR) having regard to jurisdiction, recognition, applicable law and provisions which create exceptions to the application of the lex concursus and have particular impact on the enforcement of lenders' rights in the event of default and formal insolvency...|$|R

40|$|The Japanese {{government}} has been promoting a type of secured lending that usesinventory and accounts receivable ascollateral. It is generally called "Asset Based Lending", or "ABL" in Japan. Interms of lending technology, some argue that "ABL" is <b>transactions</b> <b>lending,</b> while others {{argue that it is}} relationship lending. This paper, through a case study with a Japanese regional bank, provides empirical evidence that the majority of so called "ABL"in Japan is not <b>transactions</b> <b>lending.</b> In doing so, this paper identifies four features (appraisal, advance rate, borrowing base and monitoring) that characterize" ABL" as transactions ending. Outlining these features demonstrate how such lender manages the credit exposure of the loan in accordance with the liquidation value of the collateral. This paper finds that the majority of "ABL" loans do not possess such features, indicating that they cannot be categorized as <b>transactions</b> <b>lending.</b> Specialization in lending technologies and lack of sufficient otection of lender 2 ̆ 7 s security interest in the collateral during bankruptcy proceedings may be the reasons why banks in Japan are reluctant to conduct "ABL" as a form of <b>transactions</b> <b>lending.</b> The paper argues that it is incorrect to call every secured lending that uses inventory and accounts receivable as collateral, "ABL".

40|$|Granting {{collateral}} {{to secure}} loans is a prominent {{feature of the}} U. S. economy, but, surprisingly, {{we do not understand}} how borrowers and lenders decide whether to engage in a secured or an unsecured transaction. In this Article, Professor Mann argues that existing theories of secured lending are inadequate because the theories' predictions have not been tested against empirical data. To understand the actual pattern of secured credit, Professor Mann interviewed more than twenty borrowers and lenders in various sectors of the economy. Based on the evidence gathered in these interviews, as well as on preexisting empirical studies, this Article develops a model of the borrower's decision to grant collateral that focuses on the borrower's perceptions of {{the costs and benefits of}} secured and unsecured transactions. Granting collateral lowers the aggregate costs of a <b>lending</b> <b>transaction</b> by lowering the pre-loan perception of the risk of default. Secured credit can do this not only by increasing the lender's ability to collect the debt forcibly through liquidation of the collateral, but also in less direct ways: by decreasing the borrower's ability to obtain subsequent loans; by increasing the lender's leverage over the borrower's activities; and by repairing the loan-induced differentiation of the incentives of the borrower and the lender. Conversely, a grant of collateral can increase the costs of a <b>lending</b> <b>transaction</b> by increasing the costs of entering the transaction as well as the costs of administering the loan. In the Article's final section, Professor Mann uses the decision-based model to explain three separate aspects of the pattern of secured credit: the relatively infrequent use of secured credit by companies with strong financial records, the relation between the use of collateral and the duration of the debt, and the apparently low rate of retention of security interests by suppliers...|$|R
