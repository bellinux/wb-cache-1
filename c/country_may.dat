5|$|Nurkse also refuted {{the claim}} that if a country's {{geographical}} area is large, {{the size of its}} market also ought to be large. A <b>country</b> <b>may</b> be extremely small in area but still have a large effective demand. For example, Japan. In contrast, a <b>country</b> <b>may</b> cover a huge geographical area but its market may still be small. This may occur if {{a large part of the}} country is uninhabitable, or if the country suffers from low productivity levels and thus has a low National Income.|$|E
5|$|Observances of State {{mourning}} on {{the death}} of foreign dignitaries are governed by special instructions issued from the Ministry of Home Affairs in individual cases. However, in the event of death of either the Head of the State or Head of the Government of a foreign country, the Indian Mission accredited to that <b>country</b> <b>may</b> fly the national flag at half-mast.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{growth has been}} driven by the expansion of services that have been growing consistently faster than other sectors. It is argued that the pattern of Indian development has been a specific one and that the <b>country</b> <b>may</b> be able to skip the intermediate industrialisation-led phase in the transformation of its economic structure. Serious concerns have been raised about the jobless nature of the {{economic growth}}.|$|E
40|$|This note {{provides}} a novel argument why <b>countries</b> <b>may</b> have incentives {{to allow for}} some profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions. The reason is that a tightening of transfer pricing policies by high-tax <b>countries</b> <b>may</b> lead to more aggressive tax rate competition by low-tax countries. We analyse tax competition in a model with profit shifting through transfer pricing. High-tax <b>countries</b> <b>may</b> limit profit shifting using transfer pricing guidelines. But tightening transfer pricing guidelines may intensify tax rate competition...|$|R

5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped <b>country</b> <b>may</b> only be skilled enough {{to promote the}} export of primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Each {{participating}} country, {{other than}} the host <b>country,</b> <b>may</b> submit suggested problems to a Problem Selection Committee provided by the host country, which reduces the submitted problems to a shortlist. The team leaders arrive at the IMO {{a few days in}} advance of the contestants and form the IMO Jury which is responsible for all the formal decisions relating to the contest, starting with selecting the six problems from the shortlist. The Jury aims to order the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6. As the leaders know the problems in advance of the contestants, they are kept strictly separated and observed.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{took great}} care to shape {{perceptions}} of himself. He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information about everybody in the country. Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made money off of every transaction in the <b>country</b> <b>may</b> have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously as a sexual pervert, as a sadist, and a rapist. Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a drug trafficker, a nationalist supporting Torrijos, an ally of Cuba, and an ally of Oliver North and the Contras. He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as the DEA was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, he had {{received}} worrying British intelligence reports that {{said he was in}} danger of being assassinated and his <b>country</b> <b>may</b> face a coup d'état. His tribesmen were unhappy at Habibullah's perceived subservience to the British, and his council and relatives openly spoke of their suspicions at his inactivity. Habibullah began purging his court of officials who were known to be close to Nasrullah and Amanullah. He recalled emissaries he had sent to Persia for talks with Germany and Turkey for military aid. Meanwhile, the war took {{a turn for the worse}} for the Central Powers. The Arab revolt against Turkey and the loss of Erzurum to the Russians ended the hopes of sending a Turkish division to Afghanistan. The German influence in Persia also declined rapidly, ending the hopes that Goltz Pasha could lead a Persian volunteer division into Afghanistan. The mission came to realise that the Emir deeply mistrusted them. A further attempt by British intelligence to feed false information to the mission, purportedly originating from Goltz Pasha, convinced von Hentig of the Emir's lack of trust. A last offer was made by Nasrullah in May 1916 to remove Habibullah from power and lead the frontier tribes in a campaign against British India. However, von Hentig knew it would come to nothing, and the Germans left Kabul on 21 May 1916. Niedermayer instructed Wagner to stay in Herat as a liaison officer. The Indian members also stayed, persisting in their attempts at an alliance.|$|E
