5|$|It's a touching, believable, often funny but {{ultimately}} sad tale {{of how one}} <b>class</b> <b>can</b> take advantage of another, even {{in the guise of}} patronizing benevolence. Though sometimes shifting abruptly in time, Vanaja is an arresting story of modern-day hardship and class exploitation, recalling Charles Dickens as well as Western fairy-tale lore. Domalpalli's settings are ultra-real in detail and color, from the crude, almost feudal deprivations of Vanaja's dirt-floor background to the stately rituals and autocratic entitlement of the well-to-do.|$|E
5|$|Units {{each have}} a {{character}} class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, and how much effect they have on other units, whether they used passive or aggressive skills. There are thirty classes available to choose from: these include mounted units such as the Pegasus Knight, Sorcerers and Healers that wield magic for attack and healing respectively, soldiers who wield swords and axes, and archers who specialize in long distance attacks. The only class that is character exclusive is the Lord class, which is used by Marth. Limitations are placed on how many of one <b>class</b> <b>can</b> {{be used in a}} single battle. When a unit has reached Level 10, their <b>class</b> <b>can</b> be evolved along a select number of routes using an item called a Master Seal. Units can also be re-classed, changing to a completely different class or back to their original class at the player's discretion: the re-class options has limits as there are {{only a limited number of}} available classes for a unit to change into. If a class change is reversed, all the unit's previous stats will be retained. Each unit's weapon, which is directly associated with its class, has its level raised based on the amount of usage, while also decreasing its durability — unless merged with another identical item, the weapon will break after its maximum number of uses.|$|E
5|$|Unlike C++, C# {{does not}} support {{multiple}} inheritance, although a <b>class</b> <b>can</b> implement any number of interfaces. This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complication and simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same signature, C# allows implementing each method depending on which interface that method is being called through, or, like Java, allows implementing the method once, and have that be the one invocation on a call through any of the class's interfaces.|$|E
25|$|Beyond its {{increasingly}} visible role providing organically grown {{food for}} the School Dining Hall, the 270-acre Hotchkiss Farm is also where art <b>classes</b> <b>can</b> practice plein air painting, poetry <b>classes</b> <b>can</b> find inspiration, environmental science <b>classes</b> <b>can</b> explore terrain that includes rare grassland bird habitats, and American history <b>classes</b> <b>can</b> reflect {{on the fact that}} this was once part of a land grant from King George III. When completed, farm trails will add an estimated three to five miles to the six or more that already traverse the Hotchkiss Woods.|$|R

5|$|Each {{unit has}} their own {{character}} class, with that class determining a unit's range of movement, weapon, and strengths and weaknesses. Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded by experience points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's <b>class</b> <b>can</b> be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing their class and altering their statistics. A Support system exists where characters who remain {{next to each other}} for a number of turns talk to each other, gaining Support Points and earning stat boosts. A limit is placed on the number of Support Points that can be earned when completing a single map.|$|E
5|$|Each unit is {{assigned}} a character class, while affects their assigned weapon, strengths and weaknesses, and range {{and speed of}} movement on the battlefield. These classes range from axemen and swordsmen to thieves, to mounted units and magic users such as healers. Some characters, such as main protagonist Leif, have unique classes. Classes also naturally evolve {{during the course of}} the story. Mounted units have the option of dismounting their steeds to fight on-foot. Weapons within a unit's selected character <b>class</b> <b>can</b> be freely swapped out for more powerful versions: when mounted units dismount, they swap spears for axes or swords. Weapon effectiveness is governed by the Weapons Triangle: swords are strong against axes, axes against spears, and spears against swords.|$|E
5|$|Each unit {{is governed}} by a {{character}} class system, with their class affecting what weapons they can use. After each action in battle gains experience points (EXP). Upon reaching 100 EXP, a unit levels up and its statistics such as attack power and defense are randomly raised, while weapon ranks increase naturally when using their respective weapons. Upon reaching Level 10, and using a special item, a unit's <b>class</b> <b>can</b> be upgraded to a more powerful version with access to new items and weapons. If a unit is defeated in battle, {{they are subject to}} permanent death, being removed from all future encounters and the overall storyline with a few exceptions for story-related characters. If characters crucial to the storyline like Lyn, Eliwood or Hector fall, the game ends and the player must restart the level.|$|E

5|$|Mass Effect is a single-player action {{role-playing}} game {{in which}} the player takes the role of Commander Shepard through a third-person perspective. Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat-training and first name {{are determined by the}} player before the game begins. There are six different character classes for the player to choose from and each of them has different talents that provide enhanced combat capabilities. For example, the Soldier class is trained in weapon damage and has improved health, while the Sentinel class is trained in protecting and healing allies. At one point in the game, players may evolve their base class talent into one of two specializations, which depend on the class chosen by the player. Although any <b>class</b> <b>can</b> use any weapon type, each class is only effective with the weapons they are trained in.|$|E
5|$|Other new {{features}} {{were added to}} the series, such as the monsters being animated when they attack. The Slime Arena and Best Dresser Contest were new mini-games introduced; the casinos return from previous Dragon Quest games. Like previous games, mini medals can be found hidden throughout the worlds and can be traded for items. There are bonus dungeons and a few extra characters after beating the main storyline. There is a day and night system, as in some previous installments; with certain storyline events happening at night. While the Monster Master <b>class</b> <b>can</b> catch monsters in the original Super Famicom version it is not {{a major part of the}} game. Another returning feature from the past two games is the use of the wagon, which allows characters to be swapped out for other ones on the world map.|$|E
5|$|The game {{starts with}} a {{character}} creation screen where the player can choose items for their playable character, such as their physical appearance, race and creed. The player can choose to play {{as one of the}} eleven available classes: fighter, barbarian, paladin, ranger, wizard, druid, monk, priest, rogue, chanter and cipher. Each of them make the gameplay different; for example, the cipher can use the soul of an enemy in order to attack them, and druids can shapeshift into a beast and cast spells. The protagonist's <b>class</b> <b>can</b> also influence the number of available dialogue options. The player may adventure with up to five other characters {{out of a total of}} eight that they can pick up on their travels. These are fleshed out characters with unique personalities and appearances. Additionally, the protagonist can hire party members which the player creates in local taverns, but at a monetary cost.|$|E
