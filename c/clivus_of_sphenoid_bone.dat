40|$|SUMMARY: Giant cell tumor (GCT) <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone</b> is a {{relatively}} rare entity and metachronous multicentric GCT <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> is even rarer; {{we are aware of}} only 3 previous cases in the literature. We describe here a tumor <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone</b> that was identified 15 years after multiple resections of a GCT of the left inferior pubic ramus. Correlation is made between the histopathologic findings, MR imaging of the brain, CT of the head, and fusion positron-emission tomography (PET) /CT scan performed with fluorine- 18 fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (18 F-FDG). This report is the first to describe the appearance of a GCT <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone</b> on a fusion PET/CT examination. High metabolic activity in the base of the skull adjacent to the middle cranial fossa was demonstrated in a fashion {{similar to that of the}} known pelvic lesion. This case also demonstrates that the increased metabolic activity seen in a GCT <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone</b> may be partially obscured by the adjacent physiologic high metabolic activity of the brain. Multicentric GCT is {{a relatively}} rare entity within the spec-trum of giant cell tumors (GCTs), composing less than 1 % of all cases of GCT. This variant is usually described in the extremities. 1, 2 GCT <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone</b> typically presents with symptoms related to palsies of the adjacent cranial nerves...|$|R

40|$|Variable foramen on the grater wing <b>of</b> <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone,</b> {{which is}} {{simultaneously}} complementary opening between the orbit and middle cranial fossa. It can be find, unilaterally or bilaterally, lateral to the superior orbital fissure, below posterior {{margin of the}} lesser wings <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this work was, to establish, the incidence of this variable foramen between orbit and middle cranial fossa, and its morphology characteristics in the cases where it exist, on the small series of human skull. Material was 30 human skulls (15 dried and 15 non-dried) from collection of Department of anatomy and Department of forensic medicine of Medical faculty in Nish. The name of the openig was given as suggestion of the autor in this work: the opening on the grater wing <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone</b> was named as foramen of Hyrtl or H-foramen (foramen H); the groove on the grater wing <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone,</b> which extends from this opening, was marked as meningolacrimal groove. The presence of this foramen was established in 13 (43, 3 %) cases, and in 11 (36, 7 %) cases the opening was unilateral (5 {{on the left and}} 6 on the right side). The foramen was bilateral in 2 (6, 7 %) cases. It was observed that the opening was round or rarely eliptical. The foramen was obvious on the inner surface of the grater wing <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone,</b> {{as well as on the}} upper half of the lateral wall of the orbit, with variable distance from the lateral end of the superior orbital fissure. Variable H-foramen was detected in 43, 3 % of the cases, mostly unilaterally on the grater wing <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone.</b> Simultaneous existence <b>of</b> the H-foramen and meningolacrimal groove, indirectly point to the later obliteration of the primitive stapedial artery on the same side. Orbital groove existence do not coincidence with H-foramen existence. Dependence between the size of the H-foramen diameter and the distance from the foramen spinosum and lateral end of the superior orbital fissure was not established...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aeration <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> sinus expands {{with the}} devel-opment <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone,</b> but scant {{detailed}} volumetric data regarding this process, as it evolves from childhood to old age, exist. Using helical CT scanning, we assessed age-related volumetric changes <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> sinus. METHODS: We used CT {{data obtained from}} 214 patients (age range, 1 to 80 years; 111 male and 103 female subjects) with middle or inner ear disease to assess the extent <b>of</b> <b>sphenoid</b> aeration. We also determined volumes <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> sinuses on 1. 0 - or 1. 5 -mm reformatted images by integrating the sinus air (# 2900 HU) area. RESULTS: Sphenoid sinus aeration began as a doublet in the anterior boundary <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone</b> {{by the age of}} 5 years, with patients more than 6 years old exhibiting varying degrees of aeration. The aeration on both sides continued to expand until the third decade of life. The maximum average volume was 8. 2 6 0. 5 cm 3. Thereafter, the volume decreased grad-ually, with the average volume in the seventh decade of life being 71 % of the maximum level. The aeration of the peripheral portions <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone,</b> such as the pterygoid process, anterior clinoid process, and dorsum sella, occurred predominantly after closure of the spheno-occipital suture, and showed a tendency to recede during aging. CONCLUSION: Volumetric assessment <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> sinus by helical CT scanning revealed age-related expansion and reduction in aeration. Aeration <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone</b> begins after birth. Several studies have been performed regarding the postnatal development <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> sinus (1). In general, aeration expands with age, in keeping with the growth <b>of</b> the <b>sphenoid</b> <b>bone.</b> Little is known regarding changes in sinus aeration beyond the teenage years. Using helical CT scanning, we con-ducted a volumetric analysis <b>of</b> <b>sphenoid</b> aeration in patients ranging in age from 1 to 80 year(s) ...|$|R
