Electrodes today are able to discriminate single fibers firing, but a single action potential doesn't say much.

The standard input devices available for the control of digital music tools tend to afford a low quality of embodied control; they fail to realise our innate expressiveness and dexterity of motion. This thesis looks at ways of capturing more detailed and subtle motion for the control of computer music tools; it examines how this motion can be used to control music software, and evaluates musicians’ experience of using these systems. Two new musical controllers were created, based on a multiparametric paradigm where multiple, continuous, concurrent motion data streams are mapped to the control of musical parameters. The first controller, Phalanger, is a markerless video tracking system that enables the use of hand and finger motion for musical control. EchoFoam, the second system, is a malleable controller, operated through the manipulation of <b>conductive</b> <b>foam.</b> Both systems use machine learning techniques at the core of their functionality. These controllers are front ends to RECZ, a high-level mapping tool for multiparametric data streams. The development of these systems and the evaluation of musicians’ experience of their use constructs a detailed picture of multiparametric musical control. This work contributes to the developing intersection between the fields of computer music and human-computer interaction. The principal contributions are the two new musical controllers, and a set of guidelines for the design and use of multiparametric interfaces for the control of digital music.

This allows the catalyst bed to be heated directly, requiring less power to reach the desired temperature more quickly. Designed for heterogeneous catalysis, the method {{can be used by}} the petrochemical, chemical processing, and power-generating industries, as well as automotive catalytic converters. Catalyst beds must be heated to a light-off temperature before they catalyze the desired reactions.

The catalyst bed is heated indirectly, thus requiring excessive power. With the electrically heated catalyst bed, virtually all of the power is used to heat the support, and only a small fraction is lost to the surroundings. Although the light-off temperature of most catalysts is only a few hundred degrees Celsius, the electrically heated foam is able to achieve temperatures of 1, 200 C. Lower temperatures are achievable by supplying less electrical power to the foam.

The activity of the structured catalysts and the thermal profile of the catalytic bed, were compared to those of a powder catalyst with the same composition of the washcoat formulation, in “quasi-adiabatic” condition, under equal conditions in terms of inlet temperature and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV). The experimental results showed much better performances for the structured catalysts, both in terms of CO conversion and temperature difference between the inlet and the outlet of the catalytic bed. This results were explained in terms of backdiffusion of the reaction heat throughout the structured catalysts bed, with a consequent flattening of the temperature profile, induced by the presence of the highly <b>conductive</b> aluminum <b>foam</b> carrier. The foam was able to modify the adiabatic temperature profile, obtaining, with respect to a typical packed bed reactor, a higher temperature at the inlet section and a lowered temperature at the outlet bed section, overcoming respectively, the kinetic and thermodynamic limits, achieving so an increased CO conversion.

40|$|A {{strategy}} for growth of porous Ni 2 GeO 4 nanosheets on <b>conductive</b> nickel (Ni) <b>foam</b> with robust adhesion as a high-performance electrode for Li-ion batteries is proposed and realized, through a facile two-step method. It involves the low temperature hydro-thermal synthesis of bimetallic (Ni, Ge) hydroxide nanosheets precursor on Ni foam substrates and subsequent thermal transformation to porous Ni 2 GeO 4 nanosheets. The as-prepared Ni 2 GeO 4 nanosheets possess many interparticle mesopores {{with a size}} range from 5 to 15 nm. The hierarchical structure of porous Ni 2 GeO 4 nanosheets supported by Ni foam promises fast electron and ion transport, large electroactive surface area, and excellent structural stability. The efficacy of the specially designed structure is demonstrated by the superior electrochemical performance of the generated Ni 2 GeO 4 nanosheets including a high capacity of 1. 8 mA·h·cm− 2 at a current density of 50 μA·cm− 2, good cycle stability, and high power capability at room temperature. Because of simple conditions, this fabrication strategy may be easily extended to other mixed metal oxides (MxGeOy) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} focused on {{developing}} novel smart textiles based on conducting polymer coatings deposited on a foam substrate. This process renders the <b>foam</b> <b>conductive,</b> while retaining the tactile properties of the original material. The foam is a soft, porous and conductive solid, made by chemically oxidising pyrrole {{in the presence of}} a polyurethane foam. The 3 -D structure of this material means it is sensitive to pressures exerted from all three dimensions, making it attractive for use in wearable sensors for sport and medical applications. A potential application under investigation is the development of a smart insole for patients with Diabetes Mellitus, who require constant monitoring of the pressure exerted underfoot during walking or standing in order to reduce the risk of damaging their feet due to excess pressure being applied. Future applications for this material may also lie in the area of wearable electronic components, whereby the material can be fabricated to produce resistors, capacitors, etc. The gas sensing capabilities of this material were also investigated. Results have shown that this smart fabric based chemical sensor offers higher selectivity towards ammonia over other volatile organic vapours...|$|R
40|$|Mesoporous Mn 1. 5 Co 1. 5 O 4 (MCO) spinel {{films were}} {{prepared}} directly on a <b>conductive</b> nickel (Ni) <b>foam</b> substrate via electrodeposition and an annealing treatment as supercapacitor electrodes. The electrodeposition time markedly influenced the surface morphological, textural, and supercapacitive properties of MCO/Ni electrodes. The (MCO/Ni) - 15 min electrode (electrodeposition time: 15 min) exhibited the highest capacitance among three electrodes (electrodeposition times of 7. 5, 15, and 30 min, respectively). Further, an asymmetric supercapacitor that utilizes (MCO/Ni) - 15 min {{as a positive}} electrode, a plasma-treated activated carbon (PAC) /Ni electrode as a negative electrode, and carboxymethyl cellulose-lithium nitrate (LiNO 3) gel electrolyte (denoted as (PAC/Ni) //(MCO/Ni) - 15 min) was fabricated. In a stable operation window of 2. 0 V, the device exhibited an energy density of 27. 6 Wh·kg− 1 and a power density of 1. 01 kW·kg− 1 at 1 A·g− 1. After 5000 cycles, the specific energy density retention and power density retention were 96 % and 92 %, respectively, demonstrating exceptional cycling stability. The good supercapacitive performance and excellent stability of the (PAC/Ni) //(MCO/Ni) - 15 min device can be ascribed to the hierarchical structure and high surface area of the (MCO/Ni) - 15 min electrode, which facilitate lithium ion intercalation and deintercalation at the electrode/electrolyte interface and mitigate volume change during long-term charge/discharge cycling...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{scope of}} the present R&D is to develop an {{innovative}} support, with an integrated cooling and based on carbon composites, for the electronic sensors of the Silicon Pixel Tracker, to be installed into the ATLAS Experiment on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The inner layer of the detector is installed immediately outside the Beryllium beam pipe {{at a distance of}} 50 mm from the Interaction Point, where the high energy protons collide: the intense radiation field induce a radiation damage on the sensors so that a cooling system is necessary to remove the electrical power dissipated as heat, maintaining the sensor temperature sufficiently low. The task of the support system is to hold the detector modules in positions with high accuracy, minimizing the deformation induced by the cooling; this must be done with the lower possible mass because there are tight requirements in terms of material budget. An evaporative boiling system to remove the power dissipated by the sensors is incorporated in the support: thermal contact is made through a very <b>conductive</b> light carbon <b>foam</b> to maintain the sensor temperature sufficiently low, to limit the leakage currents and so the thermal run-away. The coolant should be CO 2, with a cooling pipe design pressure of 10 MPa. The number of pipes could be 1 or 2 and the pipe material should be carbon fiber or titanium. The structural strength of the 800 mm long support stave is given fro m a carbon fiber laminate omega shaped. The design is based on thermal/mechanical/thermo-structural analysis of assemblies made of carbon fiber composites. One R&D key element is thr production of the Carbon Fiber or Titanium pipe and of the relative joints versus the external connecting piping, having suitable mechanical and tightness properties...|$|R
