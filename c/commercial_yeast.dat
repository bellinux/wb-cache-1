25|$|Hydrogen sulfide– Often {{produced}} by yeast during fermentation {{because of a}} nitrogen deficiency in the must. This {{can be done by}} a reduction of sulfates or sulfites available in the must or by the decomposition of dead yeast cells by other yeast that releases sulfur-containing amino acids that are further broken down by the yeast. The latter often happens with wines that sit in contact with their lees {{for long periods of time}} between rackings. In the presence of alcohol, hydrogen sulfide can react with ethanol to form ethyl mercaptans and disulfides that contribute to off aromas and wine faults. Some <b>commercial</b> <b>yeast</b> strains, such as Montrachet 522 are known to produce higher levels of hydrogen sulfides than other strains, particularly if the must has some nutrient deficiencies.|$|E

40|$|In an {{experiment}} with Rosé wine, 27 different <b>commercial</b> <b>yeasts</b> were tested for {{their influence on}} the amino acid pattern of the wine. Amino acids are precursors for aromatic substances; therefore a large variation of the amino acid values in the wine was expected. Blaufränkisch grapes with 20 ° KMW were matured in the cellar with 27 different <b>commercial</b> <b>yeasts.</b> The fermentation {{was carried out in}} 34 l vessels. The wines were measured for amino acids using an HP 1200 liquid chromatograph and HP-FLD 1100 according to Umagat. The wines showed 13. 5 % alcohol and little residual sugar. The measurement results of the amino acids of the different wines showed large variations. For example, the amount of the amino acid alanine in wine varied from 17 to 138 [*]mg.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} the enological traits of two <b>commercial</b> <b>yeasts</b> (Fermol Rouge® and Fermol Mediterranée®) in a small scale and to evaluate the possibility of their application in commercial production of blackberry wine. Fermentation activity was monitored by measuring CO 2 evolution and CO 2 production rate during microfermentation of blackberry juice performed at 23 °C. Blackberry wines produced by two different yeasts were analyzed in order to compare their composition differences. Fermentations were carried on to complete sugar consumption by both yeast strains. Levels of volatile acids formed by the two yeasts were significantly different and differences in concentrations of residual sugars, malic acid, lactic acid and pH-value were highly significant. There {{were no significant differences between}} concentrations of ethanol, total acids and glycerol in blackberry wines produced by both yeasts. Chemical composition of the produced blackberry wines was in accordance with the Croatian fruit wine legislation.

Blaufränkisch grapes with 20 ° KMW were matured in the cellar with 27 different <b>commercial</b> <b>yeasts.</b> The vinification was carried out in 34 [*]l vessels. An HPLC Agilent Technology 1220 (RRLC) with a column of ZORBAX SB-C 18 15 × 2. 1 [*]mm (1. 8 [*]μm) was used for the measurement. 5 [*]μl of the sample were injected directly.

Two isolation processes were performed, before and after the re-inoculation of the plant with a <b>commercial</b> baker’s <b>yeast</b> strain. The isolates were clustered by DNA fingerprinting and a recurrent Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, different from the inoculated <b>commercial</b> baker’s <b>yeast</b> strain, was isolated.

50|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, two yeast strains used in brewing had been identified: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (top-fermenting yeast) and S. carlsbergensis (bottom-fermenting yeast).

In 1825, a method was developed to remove the liquid so the yeast could be prepared as solid blocks. The industrial production of yeast blocks was enhanced by the introduction of the filter press in 1867.
