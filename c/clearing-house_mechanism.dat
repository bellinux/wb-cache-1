40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{modeling}} power exchanges in a multi-agent interacting framework with reduced behavioral assumptions. A {{model of the}} Day Ahead Market session of OMEL (the Spanish Power Exchange) is proposed using real demand data with simulated seller strategies. The number of sellers is defined at the first stage and the quantity of goods is distributed over the population of agents according to several initial distributions. A <b>Clearing-house</b> <b>mechanism</b> matches the cumulative demand and supply curves {{in order to determine}} the market-clearing price. The resulting price time-series are statistically tested to verify the validity of the model. Results show the main properties of real market and assess the validity of the proposed model. ...|$|E

We explore various measures {{that are designed to}} render patented genetic inventions accessible to further use in research, and to diagnosis and/or treatment. They include the often-recited research or experimental-use exemption, conventional one-to-one licensing and compulsory licensing, as well as patent pools and <b>clearing-house</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The last two alternatives deserve special attention in the area of human genetics. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The Internet-based <b>clearing-house</b> <b>mechanism</b> (CHM) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is studied {{from the}} point of view of its {{information}} content, value for end-users and usability. The results show that, although the basic idea of the national CHM has been realised fairly well, the information provided by the national web sites is scarce and unprocessed. Especially the amount and processing of taxonomic, ecological and spatial information needs to be increased. In most participating countries of the CBD, construction of national clearing-houses has not reached a stage where accurate and integrant information would be provided for decision-makers. A distinct group of countries has taken an active role in the field of international biodiversity information issues. The results are also viewed {{from the point}} of view of disparity between ownership of the world’s biodiversity resources and custody of biodiversity information. Suggestions for further development of the CHM are presented and its relation to other biodiversity information initiatives is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Secretary to synthesize, with peer review, {{the best}} {{available}} scientific studies on priority areas for biodiversity conservation in marine areas beyond national jurisdiction, including information on status, trends and threats to biodiversity of these areas as well as distribution of seamounts, cold water coral reefs and other ecosystems, their functioning and the ecology of associated species, and to disseminate this through the <b>clearing-house</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In undertaking this task, the Executive Secretary was asked to work actively with, and {{to take into account}} scientific information available from, the range of relevant expertise available in governmental, intergovernmental, non-governmental, regional and scientific institutions, expert scientific processes and workshops, and, indigenous and local communities, where appropriate. The present document is the first attempt to review and synthesize existing literature for the priority habitats listed in decision VIII/ 24, which include seamounts, cold water coral reefs, hydrothermal vents and other ecosystems in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The document presents, in synthesized format, information about their distribution, status and trends (where available), as well as about the threats facing these ecosystems. Information about the functioning of these ecosystems and the ecology of associated species is also presented. Finally, the documen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —This paper {{discusses}} {{the relevance of}} bioinformatics to the Convention on Biological Diversity. It also {{discusses the}} role of the Convention’s <b>Clearing-House</b> <b>Mechanism</b> and the Biosafety Clearing-House, and their role in assisting Parties and other Governments with issues pertaining to bioinformatics in general. Finally, it reviews many work programs established under the Convention and the potential role of bioinformatics in assisting with their development and implementation. Key words. —biodiversity informatics, biodiversity convention, international cooperation The word bioinformatics does not have a uniform usage: it may refer primarily to genomics (Sugden and Pennisi 2000, Ouzounis and Valencia 2003), or may also include more general issues related to biology and computation (Scott 2004). This paper defines bioinformatics as the application of tools of computation and analysis to capture and interpretation of biological data (Bayat 2002). For many reasons, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity is paying increased attention to issues related to computational biology and to bioinformatics in general. Indeed, data collection and dissemination, data mining and modeling, development, interoperability and further enhancement of databases, and visualization of data were explicitly identified by the COP during its seventh meeting, and are found throughout the work programmes of many thematic areas and cross-cutting issues of the Convention. This paper discusses the development and role o...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} history of {{descriptor}} lists (DLs) —scientific standards for documenting plant genetic resources—which have been published by Bioversity International since 1976 (formerly IBPGR 1974 – 1991; IPGRI 1991 – 2006). Each DL represents an important tool; together, they constitute {{the basis for a}} standardized characterization system that provides an internationally agreed format and universally understood ‘language’ for plant genetic resources data. The paper also presents an analysis of data collected through questionnaires and web statistics on the impact of DLs in order to understand their use by major stakeholders. The usefulness of Bioversity’s DLs was measured in terms of their value in facilitating the establishment of databases, and improving collaborations and information exchange among organizations. Most survey respondents reported that they not only used Bioversity’s DLs, but recognized them as the standards for plant genetic resources data collection and management. Bioversity’s DLs are widely respected because they are developed by large groups of crop specialists. Together, the DLs are helping Bioversity to meet the ambitious objective of establishing a <b>Clearing-House</b> <b>Mechanism</b> as set forth by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Article 18. 3, which seeks to promote and facilitate information exchange among parties, Governments and stakeholders in order to assure a full implementation of the CBD. A number of areas for improvement were identified, although some of them are either outside Bioversity’s mandate or depend on human or financial capital for implementation...|$|E
