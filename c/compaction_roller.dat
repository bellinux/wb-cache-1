40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} of {{composite}} prepreg tape winding, the compaction force could influence the quality of winding products. According to the analysis and experiments, during the winding process of a rocket motor nozzle aft exit cone with a winding angle, {{there would be an}} error between the deposition speed of tape layers and the feeding speed of the <b>compaction</b> <b>roller,</b> which could influence the compaction force. Both a lack of compaction and overcompaction related to the feeding of the <b>compaction</b> <b>roller</b> could result in defects of winding nozzles. Thus, a flexible winding system has been developed for rocket motor nozzle winding. In the system, feeding of the <b>compaction</b> <b>roller</b> could be adjusted in real time to achieve an invariable compaction force. According to experiments, the force deformation model of the winding tape is a time-varying system. Thus, a forgetting factor recursive least square based parameter estimation proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller has been developed, which could estimate the time-varying parameter and control the compaction force by adjusting the feeding of the <b>compaction</b> <b>roller</b> during the winding process. According to the experimental results, a winding nozzle with fewer voids and a smooth surface could be wounded by the invariable compaction force in the flexible winding system...|$|E

The first part of this study evaluated relationships between different field compaction patterns and the uniformity of air void distribution in asphalt pavements. A number of projects with different asphalt mixture types were compacted, and cores were taken at different locations from these projects. The X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) system was used to capture the air void distributions in these cores. The analysis results have revealed that the uniformity of air void distribution is highly related to the compaction pattern and the sequence of different compaction equipment. More importantly, the efficiency of compaction (reducing air voids) at a point was found to be a function of the location of this point with respect to the <b>compaction</b> <b>roller</b> width. The results in this study supported the development of the "Compaction Index (CI)," which quantifies the degree of field compaction. The CI {{is a function of the}} number of passes at a point and the position of the point with respect to the <b>compaction</b> <b>roller</b> width. This index was found to correlate reasonably well with percent air voids in the pavement. The CI calculated from field compaction was also related to the slope of the compaction curve obtained from the Superpave gyratory compactor. This relationship offers the opportunity to predict field compactability based on laboratory measurements. The compaction of longitudinal joints was investigated, and recommendations were put forward to improve joint compaction. The air void distributions in gyratory specimens were related to the mixture mechanical properties measured using the Overlay and Hamburg tests. The second part of this study focused on studying the relationship between air void distribution and moisture diffusion. A laboratory test protocol was developed to measure the diffusion coefficient of asphalt mixtures. This important property has not measured before. The results revealed that the air void phase within the asphalt mixtures controls the rate of moisture diffusion. The measured diffusion coefficients correlated well with the percent and size of connected air voids. The measured diffusion coefficient is a necessary parameter in modeling moisture transport and predicting moisture damage in asphalt mixtures.

40|$|Vibratory rollers are {{commonly}} used for compaction of embankments and landfills. This task is time consuming and constitutes {{a significant part of}} most large construction and infrastructure projects. By improving the compaction efficiency, the construction industry would reduce costs and environmental impact. This research project studies the influence of the vibration frequency of the drum, which is normally a fixed roller property, and whether resonance can be utilized to improve the compaction efficiency. The influence of frequency on roller compaction has not before been studied but the concept of resonance compaction has previously been applied successfully in deep compaction of fills and natural deposits. In order to examine the influence of vibration frequency on the compaction of granular soil, small-scale compaction tests of sand were conducted under varying conditions with a vertically oscillating plate. Subsequently, full-scale tests were conducted using a vibratory soil <b>compaction</b> <b>roller</b> and a test bed of crushed gravel. The results showed that resonance can be utilized in soil compaction by vibratory rollers and plates and that the optimum compaction frequency from an energy perspective is at, or slightly above, the coupled compactor-soil resonant frequency. Since rollers operate far above resonance, the compaction frequency can be significantly reduced, resulting in a considerable reduction in fuel consumption, environmental impact and machine wear. The thesis also presents an iterative equivalent-linear method to calculate the frequency response of a vibrating foundation, such as a compacting plate or the drum of a roller. The method seems promising for predicting the resonant frequency of the roller-soil system and can be used to determine the optimum compaction frequency without site- and roller-specific measurements.

40|$|Meehan, ChristopherThe {{objective}} of the study presented in this thesis is to investigate the use of continuous compaction control (CCC) systems within an earthwork compaction specification framework. For this purpose, the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) funded a field study to construct a small-scale soil embankment, utilizing CCC technology simultaneously with conventional in situ compaction verification test methods during the construction process. The material {{that was used to}} build the embankment classified as poorly-graded sand with silt. The CCC roller measured machine drive power (MDP) values, compaction meter values (CMV), and corresponding global positioning system (GPS) location values. For conventional in situ compaction verification, numerous density-based quality assurance test methods (e. g., Nuclear Density Gauge and Sand Cone) and modulus-based test methods (e. g., Lightweight Deflectometer and GeoGauge) were performed. A holistic analysis of the data collected from the field study was performed to assess the use of CCC systems in an earthwork compaction specification framework. The first goal {{of this study was to}} examine the possibility of using data recorded by CCC systems to monitor and control the thickness of compacted soil lifts during earthwork operations. During the field study, the <b>compaction</b> <b>roller</b> utilized a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) to determine the three dimensional location of the compactor in real-time. Data collected from the field study was then used to demonstrate how GPS measurements recorded by CCC equipment could be used for field monitoring of lift thickness. The use of simple and sophisticated geospatial interpolation techniques were examined for interpolating measured field elevation data onto a uniform grid for lift thickness evaluation. The approach that is presented can be used to build spatial maps of compacted soil lift thickness, which are a useful decision-making tool for field inspectors. The second goal of this study was to perform statistical regression analyses to compare the results of the in situ spot testing methods with the two CCC measurements (MDP and CMV) that were recorded during the compaction process. In order to accurately compare the in situ spot testing measurements and CCC measurements, Nearest Neighbor, Inverse Distance Weighting, and Ordinary Kriging interpolation techniques were utilized to predict CCC measurements at the corresponding in situ spot test locations. In general, regression analyses performed using the CCC predictions from the Ordinary Kriging method showed slightly higher correlations, however, the difference did not appear significant enough to outweigh the complex nature of this geospatial interpolation technique. Univariate regression analysis was performed first for point-by-point comparisons of the data and then on a data set which comprised of average values for each lift and pass. The point-by-point comparisons yielded weak correlations, while the comparison of the average value data sets showed much stronger correlations; this finding agrees well with observations that have been reported by other researchers. As other researchers have also reported that moisture content can drastically affect the compaction process and resulting density of soil, additional analyses using a multivariate regression technique were performed, which introduced the use of in situ measured moisture content as an independent variable. The results from these regression correlations showed generally much stronger correlation between the in situ test measurements and the CCC measurements for both the point-by-point and average data sets. This observation provided confirmation of the influence of moisture content on the in situ test measurements and the CCC measurements. The final goal of the study was to evaluate the use of CCC technology within an earthwork compaction specification framework. To accomplish this goal, implementation of existing CCC compaction verification acceptance criteria using the data collected from the aforementioned field study was performed. The acceptance criteria that were assessed include: spot testing of roller measured weakest areas, limiting percentage change in roller measured values, and comparison of roller measured values to in situ measured values. Each of the three acceptance criteria show potential for implementation into an earthwork specification; however, since the spot testing of roller measured weakest areas method still utilizes conventional in situ methods, it shows the most promise for immediate adoption and transition into CCC technology.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} two fold: to use near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy for real-time monitoring and control of key compact attributes: content uniformity, moisture content, relative density, tensile strength and Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus, during roller compaction; and, to develop a model for predicting the improvement in <b>compaction</b> behavior, during <b>roller</b> <b>compaction,</b> due to the plasticization effect of ambient moisture. Initially, compact strength and the post-milling particle-size distribution were related to the slope of the best-fit line through the NIR spectra for samples prepared under different roller compactor settings. The relationship was, however, found to be dependent on the moisture content of the material. Moisture was also found to influence the key compact attributes. Hence, multivariate data analysis was used to relate the spectral data with the above key compact attributes. NIR calibration curves were generated using the spectral data collected on simulated compacts, i. e., tablets prepared under uni-axial compression, and tested on the simulated compacts and by monitoring the ribbons as they exited the roller compactor. For all compact attributes, the NIR predicted values agreed well with the values measured using a reference method. Effect of variation in ambient moisture levels on the compaction behavior of the model formulations was also studied by comparing the physical and mechanical properties of compacts prepared by <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> with those collected on the simulated compacts. For all materials, samples prepared at constant roller compactor settings showed constant density and a decrease in tensile strength with increasing moisture content. Surrogate tablets prepared at constant pressure showed the opposite effect, i. e., density increased while tensile strength remained almost constant with increasing moisture content. This suggests different influence of moisture on the material under <b>roller</b> <b>compaction,</b> in which the roll gap (i. e., thickness and therefore density) remains almost constant, vs. under uni-axial compression, in which the thickness is free to change in response to the applied pressure. Variation in the ambient moisture during <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> was also found to influence the characteristics of tablets produced from the granules obtained post-milling the compacts.

40|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>compaction</b> is a dry {{granulation}} technology, used to overcome unfavorable physical properties of powders and APIs, such as poor flow, low and/or inhomogeneous bulk density or segregation/floating of powder blends. Associated with many advantageous properties, {{one of the}} major <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> drawbacks is the potential for relatively high amounts of fine particles < 0. 1 mm after milling of the ribbons – they can partially disintegrate into their primary particles. For eight blends with different amounts of fine, medium and coarse granules fractions it could be shown that the flow properties of the blends as well as the tablets tensile strength significantly suffered from the presence of roller compacted fines. Higher amounts of fines (45 % and 60 %) surprisingly over-compensated this effect: now the high number of particles and their large surface area appears to be predominant – despite the poor flow. The best tensile strength data derived from the medium fraction 0. 1 - 1. 0 mm: the wide variety of smaller and larger particles with good flow properties easily aligns during filling and compression phase. For the coarse particles 1. 0 - 1. 25 mm, their limited specific surface area and therefore reduced ability to establish interparticular bindings has minor negative impact on the blends compressibility. For gentle milling of the ribbons, four different milling devices as well as their settings (different sieve screen sizes and types, rotors, rotor speeds, rotor/sieve distances, etc) were evaluated: the integrated Gerteis granulator with newly modified sieve housing delivered the best results, whereas for smaller ribbons quantities also the independently driven Frewitt mill GLA_ORV prove to be a viable option. Low amounts of dry binders (PEG 1500 and 4000, PVP K 30, PVP/VA copolymer, HPC) were added to the standard formulation MCC to reduce fines after milling: for this purpose and for batch variability during milling already 3 % PEG 1500 had a positive impact, but tablets crushing strength dropped by 20 %. 9 % PVP K 30 is required for fines reduction by 6. 1 %, the best overall result; however, tablets disintegration time is higher. To learn more about excipients for <b>roller</b> <b>compaction,</b> compression trials were performed with pure excipients and rather formulation-like 1 : 1 blends with MCC. The objective was to get information about the manufacturing methods comparability (direct tabletting vs. roller compaction/tabletting vs. texture analyzer, TA) and the extend of their predictability. The tablet’s crushing strength of each formulation is calculated by using the slope’s formula for data standardization and direct comparison in a metric ranking order, like for the three different sets of TA data. The direct tabletting data prove to be predictable with a relatively high probability from TA compression of powders. To a limited extend this is also valid for prediction of <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> feasibility, using direct tabletting trials as well as the three TA characterization systems. Here the TA compression of powders is preferred if only a limited amount of material is available. If time is more critical than material availability, a <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> trial should be considered in order to manufacture a few intact ribbons at different compaction force levels: milling and tabletting of the ribbons can be skipped by assessing the ribbons properties with the TA. Looking into the excipients, MCC of adequately small d 50 (type Avicel PH 101) reaches the best scores for direct tabletting and <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> / tabletting and justifies being the basic ingredient of <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> formulations. In contrast to that, the much larger particles of Avicel PH 200 are not appropriate for this process. Despite its poor performance as pure excipient in direct tabletting and <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> / tabletting, Tablettose 70 shows unexpectedly good results in the 1 : 1 blend with Avicel PH 101, so this combination can be considered for formulation development.

Samples were exposed to two tableting forces and two dwell times. Half of these samples were stored for six months at two different temperatures, 20 and 40 °C. These studies indicated that both force and dwell time are significant factors contributing to aspirin degradation when tableted in combination with sodium bicarbonate. Storage temperature was also found to be significant. The influence of force and dwell time is consistent with current powder consolidation hypotheses such as cold welding, and fusion bonding. ^ In order to thoroughly evaluate <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> of an effervescent formulation, a statistical design was selected containing all possible combinations of formulation ingredients. These combinations represented complete effervescent formulations composed of powders, granules or a combination of both powders and granules. Each combination was assessed for chemical stability, processing characteristics, and product quality. These {{studies have shown that the}} separation of reactive materials, by means of <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> and subsequent granulation, is a viable method to improve product stability while still maintaining good product quality and processing characteristics. While this study has focused on effervescent formulations, this same principle is quite applicable to any tableted system where a physical or chemical incompatibility must be overcome. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{compression}} behaviour of powders during <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> {{is dominated}} {{by a number of}} factors, such as process conditions (roll speed, roll gap, feeding mechanisms and feeding speed) and powder properties (particle size, shape, moisture content). The moisture content affects the powder properties, such as the flowability and cohesion, {{but it is not clear}} how the moisture content will influence the powder compression behaviour during <b>roller</b> <b>compaction.</b> In this study, the effect of moisture contents on <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> behaviour of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC, Avicel PHI 02) was investigated experimentally. MCC samples of different moisture contents were prepared by mixing as-received MCC powder with different amount of water that was sprayed onto the powder bed being agitated in a rotary mixer. The flowability of these samples were evaluated in terms of the poured angle of repose and flow functions. The moist powders were then compacted using the instrumented roller compactor developed at the University of Birmingham. The flow and compression behaviour during <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> and the properties of produced ribbons were examined. It has been found that, as the moisture content increases, the flowability of moist MCC powders decreases and the powder becomes more cohesive. As a consequence of non-uniform flow of powder into the compaction zone induced by the friction between powder and side cheek plates, all produced ribbons have a higher density in the middle and lower densities at the edges. For the ribbons made of powders with high moisture contents, different hydration states across the ribbon width were also identified from SEM images. Moreover, it was interesting to find that these ribbons were split into two halves. This is attributed to the reduction in the mechanical strength of moist powder compacts with high moisture contents produced at high compression pressures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|During Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) construction, <b>compaction</b> <b>rollers</b> {{provide the}} energy {{required}} to produce a specified density. However, {{little is known about}} the heuristics used by the roller operators. This study forms part of a larger action research project focussing on the improvement of the HMA paving process – taking into account the importance of “on-site operations” for the control over quality, continuous process improvement and the adoption of new technologies. The primary aim is to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between and the effect of operator heuristics, motion patterns, coverage patterns, temperature differentials and other characteristics during the compaction process. This paper describes the importance of the compaction process; discusses the role of the roller operator and presents developments in the use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to assist the compaction process. The results justify an action research methodology involving the researcher, innovative technologies and most importantly, operators involved in the compaction process. The movements of the compaction equipment are logged successfully using a GPS system. The operational choices made by the operators are made explicit. This explicit information will provide the leverage for the next steps in the research process. Firstly, to discuss and confront the operational choices made during construction operations, and secondly, to develop and implement revised operational strategies with those closest to the paving process namely the asphalt paving team...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of impact}} rollers has {{increased}} {{for many decades}} over {{a wide variety of}} applications {{in various parts of the}} world. Many manufacturers have made claims that impact <b>compaction</b> <b>rollers</b> could have an effect to 1 m or more. In addition, other positive features such as greater depth of influence and faster travel speed than conventional rollers are being reported from the field. However, there is a lack of theoretical explanations or scientific research information for how to operate these rollers. Hence, this study will focus on a geotechnical modeling that describes the behavior of soils during ground compaction using various impact rollers (e. g., triangular, Landpac 3 -sided, Landpac 5 -sided, and octagonal shapes). In addition, this study will estimate more precisely the depth of influence for impact rollers. To do so, the general purpose finite element computer program LS-DYNA is used for numerical predictions. The finite element study is carried out with three-dimensional models. A simplified elastic perfectly plastic model with the Druker-Prager yield criterion is used for soil modeling and rollers are treated as a rigid body (i. e., incompressible material). The result of this study compares well with existing field experiment data for estimating vertical stress profile and compaction features, and demonstrates that the impact rollers are appropriate for thick layers...|$|R
40|$|An {{instrumented}} Fitzpatrick Model L- 83 Chilsonator {{was used}} to evaluate the granulation of pharmaceutical materials using <b>roller</b> <b>compaction.</b> The instrumentation measured the compaction forces produced during <b>roller</b> <b>compaction.</b> The effects of the compactor parameter settings on the characteristics of the granulations produced were evaluated. The granulations were also evaluated for physical characteristics which would influence the tableting behavior of these materials. The excipients studied were several grades of microcrystalline cellulose and hydrous lactose roller compacted as single materials. The two drug blends were an aspirin blend and an acetaminophen blend. ^ The effects of compactor parameter settings on the characteristics of the granulations produced were evaluated using a quadratic regression model. The response variables monitored were the particle size distribution and the compressibility of the granulations produced by <b>roller</b> <b>compaction.</b> The reduced models obtained differed for each of the materials evaluated. The effect of the compactor parameters on the material being compacted depended not only on the system variables but also on the material deformation properties. Response surface plots were generated to enable prediction of the compactor parameter settings which would produce granulations with the desired particle size distributions and compressibility. ^ The flow, friability, bulk density, particle size distribution and compressibility of the granulations produced by <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> were evaluated. Particle size distribution size changes depended on the compactor parameter levels. The compressibility or deformation tendencies were reduced for all granulations that showed an increase in the geometric mean particle size. The magnitude of the compressibility changes depended on the compactor parameter levels used and the deformation properties of the material. The material did not show any improvement in flow. This flow testing was performed without the addition of a lubricant to the final granules. The bulk densities of the granulations of the excipients all showed an increase over the uncompacted powder. The drug blends had a mixture of increasing and decreasing bulk densities depending on the compactor parameter levels used for production. With optimal compactor settings granulations with good tableting properties can be produced. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>compaction</b> is a {{pharmaceutical}} unit operation typically scaled-up and controlled through {{trial and error}} to produce compacted powders with specific qualities. The goal of this research was to develop a methodology to predict final roller compact properties based on raw material properties and process conditions for use in scale-up and control. Uniaxial compacts were created with an Instron/Sintech universal testing machine to simulate <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> ribbons. The viscoelastic nature of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and mixtures of acetaminophen (APAP) and MCC were successfully represented by viscoelastic solid behavior through stress relaxation experiments and Maxwell modeling. Viscoelastic parameters from Maxwell models and average powder particle size were used to model the viscoelastic contact area between two deforming particles in the system. The viscoelastic contact area was coupled with process parameters from uniaxial compaction in a statistical least squares regression models to predict experimentally determined final compact density with a correlation coefficient of R 2 = 0. 90 at 90 % confidence. This model is greatly improved over a model without contact area of R 2 = 0. 66. Contact area was shown not to improve statistical models for density of roller compacted ribbons. This study shows that viscoelastic properties in least squares regression models in conjunction with process parameters is a viable method for control of a uniaxial compaction process. Forces, such as friction and particle size distribution, not included in this study are thought to have a greater effect on <b>roller</b> <b>compaction</b> than the viscoelastic properties. ...|$|R
