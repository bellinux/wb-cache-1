The <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> effect induces radial flange loadings {{which in turn}} causes flange curling. This curling increases the axial flange stresses and induces transverse bending. These effects are more important in composite structures due to their general inability to redistribute stresses by general yielding, such as in metal structures. A detailed finite element analysis was conducted and used {{in the design of}} composite curved frame specimens. Five specimens were statically tested and compared with predicted and test strains. The curved frame effects must be accurately accounted for to avoid premature fracture; finite element methods can accurately predict most of the stresses and no elastic relief from <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> effects occurred in the composite frames tested.

The {{accuracy of the}} proposed element is not controlled by the subtended angle of the element with the angle up to π.

Consequently, the strain energy of the <b>curved</b> <b>beam</b> element can be integrated by the infinitesimal sections along the element length. The relationship between the displacements and the corresponding strains in the straight beam is simpler than that in the curvilinear co-ordinate description widely adopted by many researchers in their element derivations.
