40|$|Bridge {{stay cables}} are {{vulnerable}} to dynamic excitations by wind. There are different countermeasures to suppress unfavorable bridge stay cable vibrations {{and one of the}} effective countermeasures is to connect stay cables by cross-ties to form a <b>cable</b> <b>network.</b> However, the dynamic behaviour of a <b>cable</b> <b>network</b> is not clearly understood and most of the current designs are based on physical tests and numerical simulations. In this thesis, an effort has been made to understand the in-plane free vibration of a <b>cable</b> <b>network.</b> Three analytical models have been developed to investigate the in-plane free vibration of a basic <b>cable</b> <b>network</b> with a rigid transverse cross-tie, a general <b>cable</b> <b>network</b> with a single line of rigid transverse cross-ties, and a basic <b>cable</b> <b>network</b> with a flexible transverse cross-tie. The key system parameters of a <b>cable</b> <b>network</b> have been identified, which include the segment ratio, the frequency ratio, the mass-tension ratio, the length ratio, the cross-tie flexibility parameter, and the total number of interconnected cables. Extensive parametric study has been conducted to evaluate the role of each parameter in affecting the performance of a <b>cable</b> <b>network.</b> All the analytical model results are verified by numerical simulations using the Finite Element software ABAQUS 6. 9...|$|R
