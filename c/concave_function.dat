A linear function is a convex function, which implies that every local minimum is a global minimum; similarly, a linear function is a <b>concave</b> <b>function,</b> which implies that every local maximum is a global maximum.|$|E
25|$|Here {{taking the}} square root {{introduces}} further downward bias, by Jensen's inequality, {{due to the}} square root being a <b>concave</b> <b>function.</b> The bias in the variance is easily corrected, but the bias from the square root {{is more difficult to}} correct, and depends on the distribution in question.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{the term}} n−1 is called Bessel's correction, and it is also used in sample {{covariance}} and the sample standard deviation (the square root of variance). The square root is a <b>concave</b> <b>function</b> and thus introduces negative bias (by Jensen's inequality), which depends on the distribution, and thus the corrected sample standard deviation (using Bessel's correction) is biased. The unbiased estimation of standard deviation is a technically involved problem, though for the normal distribution using the term n−1.5 yields an almost unbiased estimator.|$|E
