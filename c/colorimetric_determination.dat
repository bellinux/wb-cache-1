40|$|Nowadays, the {{attainment}} of microsystems that integrate most of the stages involved in an analytical process has raised an enormous interest in several research fields. This approach provides experimental set-ups of increased robustness and reliability, which simplify their application to in-line and continuous biomedical and environmental monitoring. In this work, a novel, compact and autonomous microanalyzer aimed at multiwavelength <b>colorimetric</b> <b>determinations</b> is presented. It integrates the microfluidics (a three-dimensional mixer and a 25 mm length "Z-shape" optical flow-cell), a highly versatile multiwavelength optical detection system and the associated electronics for signal processing and drive, {{all in the same}} device. The flexibility provided by its design allows the microanalyzer to be operated either in single fixed mode to provide a dedicated photometer or in multiple wavelength mode to obtain discrete pseudospectra. To increase its reliability, automate its operation and allow it to work under unattended conditions, a multicommutation sub-system was developed and integrated with the experimental set-up. The device was initially evaluated in the absence of chemical reactions using four acidochromic dyes and later applied to determine some key environmental parameters such as phenol index, chromium(VI) and nitrite ions. Results were comparable with those obtained with commercial instrumentation and allowed to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed microanalyzer as an autonomous and portable device able to be applied to other analytical methodologies based on <b>colorimetric</b> <b>determinations.</b> MECCAPESMEC-CAPES [CTQ 2009 - 12128, CONSOLIDER INGENIO 2010 -CSD 2006 - 12, PHB 2010 - 0064 -PC]CYTEDCYTED [P 509 AC 0376]FAPESP [2009 / 08486 - 4]FAPESPMetMex PenolesMet-Mex Penole...|$|R

The abbreviation FBCx, stands for [...] "Fat Binding Complexer" [...] and can be associated with the brand names, [...] "Alpha-Fibe" [...] and [...] "Calorease". There are two other naturally occurring cyclodextrins, β (beta) - and γ (gamma) -, which contain seven and eight glucose units respectively. In water, these fibers take on a toroid or truncated cone configuration. In aqueous medium, the exterior surface of cyclodextrins is hydrophilic while the interior core is hydrophobic. This allows for the formation of guest-host relationships with small hydrophobic molecules. McGowan et al., for example, demonstrated that α-cyclodextrin was very effective at solubilizing the free fatty acids that are generated in the <b>colorimetric</b> <b>determination</b> of triglycerides. Shimada et al. have demonstrated that at an oil:water interface α-cyclodextrin “threads” onto fatty acids in a manner analogous to threading beads onto a string. According to these authors, the number of cyclodextrin molecules per fatty acid appears to be dependent upon the length of the fatty acids that are involved. Due to the small pore size it was generally believed that α-cyclodextrin could not form a complex with triglyceride. However, Artiss et al. demonstrated that α-cyclodextrin could complex triglyceride and at ratios that are significantly different from the 1:1 that is typical for dietary fibers. The ratio for α-cyclodextrin is actually closer to 1:9 (fiber:fat ratio). Trichard et al. have demonstrated that α-cyclodextrin and soybean oil can form porous beads that may find utility in delivering water-insoluble pharmaceuticals.|$|E

Thus, in a single coupled system neuraminidase releases N-acetylneuraminic acid, which is cleaved to N-acetyl-D-mannosamine and pyruvic acid; finally, pyruvate is reduced to lactate as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is oxidized.

Determinations of these halide anions follow the displacement reaction using the chelate compound of (2 -(3, 5 -dibromo- 2 -pyridylazo) - 5 -(diethylamino) phenol) (3, 5 -Br 2 -PADAP) and heavy metal salts as colorimetric reagent. Different from regular silver nitrate titrations, the chloride, bromide, and iodide anions compete with the 3, 5 -Br 2 -PADAP ligand and change the colour of the 3, 5 -Br 2 -PADAP-metal chelate compound dramatically. These clearer colour changes make the semi-quantitative <b>colorimetric</b> <b>determination</b> of chloride, bromide, and iodide anions possible. The colour changes are imaged using a conventional flatbed scanner, and digitized. After statistical analysis, these colour changes in the RIDA array provide facile identification of chloride, bromide, and iodide anions at a wide concentration range (10 mu M to 10 mM) without any misclassification. The RIDA array is able to discriminate without misclassifications among seven concentrations of chloride, bromide, and iodide anions.

40|$|SUMMARY. Mercury {{has been}} {{determined}} by radiochemical neutron-activation analysis n nineteen representative rocks from the Skaergaard intrusion and in the separated cumulus minerals of five. The chilled marginal gabbro contains o' 23 ppm Hg, values in the Layered Series rocks ranging from o'o 7 to o' 34 ppm, in one exceptional case reaching I " 23 ppm Hg. There is a tendency for mercury to be more abundant in leucocratic than in average or melanocratic rocks at a similar horizon. Some-what higher levels of mercury {{are found in the}} granophyric rocks {{at the top of the}} intrusion. Apart from a weak and sporadic tendency to be preferentially enriched inplagioclase, the distribu-tion of mercury between the various cumulus phases i fairly uniform and it is thought to occur as uncharged atoms mainly occupying spaces resulting from lattice defects and imperfections rather than in specific structural sites. The distribution pattern of mercury in the intrusion appears to be determined by its high volatility and chemical inertness; no real evidence of any chalcophile character isobserved. MOSTLY due to the lack of reliable analytical data, little is known of the behaviour of mercury in igneous rocks; earlier spectrographic and <b>colorimetric</b> <b>determinations</b> could be regarded at best as semi-quantitative.

40|$|The major {{links in}} the cycling of {{chromium}} in soils and in natural waters are between chromium(III) and chromium (VI). Between the larger links are lesser links involving processes of mobilization and oxidation of CrIII and reduction of CrVI. The gaps are mainly {{in our understanding}} of the factors that control these processes. If soluble CrIII is added to an "average" soil, a portion of it will become immediately oxidized by manganese oxides to CrVI. The rest of the CrIII may remain reduced for long periods of time, even in the presence of electron-accepting manganese oxides. However, this less available CrIII can be mobilized by low molecular weight organic complexers and then oxidized where redox conditions are optimal. Usually part of any CrVI added to a soil or sediment will be reduced instantly, especially under acid conditions. On the other hand, high concentrations of polluting CrVI may quickly exhaust the readily available reducing power of the matrix material and excess CrVI, the thermodynamically stable form in air, may persist for years in soils or lagoons without reduction. Cleanup of chromium pollution must involve the surrounding of both CrIII and CrVI with excesses of slowly available reducing substances and sealing them permanently from inputs of atmospheric oxygen. Monitoring the effectiveness of the measures is mandatory, but fortunately the chemical testing for CrVI in soil and water is simple and problem free compared with most <b>colorimetric</b> <b>determinations...</b>|$|R
