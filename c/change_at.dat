40|$|In modern corporations, the {{corporate}} headquarters (CHQ) unit is considered {{central to the}} fortunes of the overall firm. In light of ever-changing environments, <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> the CHQ have become a crucial concern in management research and practice, and scholars have studied a variety of <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> the CHQ. Despite the common focus on the CHQ entity and the potential for cross-fertilization across several research tracks, a coherent picture of this dispersed body of knowledge is lacking. This paper reviews 25 years of research on <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> the CHQ. In so doing, it advances a common language and an overarching framework that integrates the existing knowledge in the intellectual domains of strategy, organizational design and international business research. On this basis, the authors suggest directions for future research to advance knowledge of: (1) the pressure for and resistance to <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> the CHQ; (2) interrelationships among <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> the CHQ; (3) <b>change</b> processes <b>at</b> the CHQ; (4) agents involved in <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> the CHQ; and (5) adaptive and disruptive effects of <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> the CHQ. Overall, the study provides a conceptual basis for combining the existing knowledge of <b>changes</b> <b>at</b> the CHQ and serves as a guide for future research...|$|R

5|$|A {{significant}} <b>change</b> <b>at</b> {{this time}} was that players were no longer required {{to be members of}} the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, {{as it was in the}} early years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club's identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography rather than religion is now seen as the primary reason for supporting Hibs, who draw most of their support from the north and east of Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Also in the off-season, Gillis fired Luongo's goaltending coach Ian Clark {{and hired}} Roland Melanson in his place. Luongo {{had been a}} {{personal}} friend of Clark's and publicly stated being surprised and disappointed with the switch. The decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on his willingness to work with Luongo on a full-time basis – something Clark was unable to do. Despite the coaching <b>change</b> <b>at</b> the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson {{leading up to the}} 2010–11 season and employed several changes in his playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters.|$|E
5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1°C <b>change</b> <b>at</b> 500hpa.|$|E

5|$|Aston Villa {{won their}} sixth FA Cup in 1920. For the {{remainder}} of the inter-war years though, Villa were on a slow decline that would lead to them being relegated to the Second Division in 1936 {{for the first time in}} their history. They returned to the top-tier of English football by the outbreak of the Second World War. As with many clubs, the war brought much change to Villa Park and remainder of the 1940s were spent rebuilding the team. By 1957, Villa were a Cup winning side once again with the clubs seventh FA Cup win. Even though Villa won the inaugural League Cup in 1960, the club were to enter into a very unsuccessful period. The 1960s saw much <b>change</b> <b>at</b> Villa Park. By the end of the 1960s, Villa were languishing in the Second Division and fan pressure led to the resignation of the Board and the introduction of Doug Ellis as Villa Chairman.|$|E

5|$|At 05:37 {{an enemy}} contact report was made, and course {{was changed to}} {{starboard}} to close range. Neither ship was in good fighting trim. Hood, designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate decking armour {{and would have to}} close the range quickly, as she would become progressively less vulnerable to plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had not been adequately retrained. Prince of Wales, with thicker armour, was less vulnerable to 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course <b>change</b> <b>at</b> 05:49, but they had made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their aft turrets could not fire. Prinz Eugen, with Bismarck , had Prince of Wales and Hood slightly forward of the beam, and both ships could deliver full broadsides.|$|E
5|$|Australia allows gay men {{and lesbians}} to serve openly. Openly gay and lesbian {{personnel}} were banned from the ADF until November 1992 when the Australian Government decided to remove this prohibition. The heads of the services and most military personnel opposed this <b>change</b> <b>at</b> the time, and it caused considerable public debate. Opponents of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian personnel argued that doing so would greatly harm the ADF's cohesiveness and cause large numbers of resignations. This did not eventuate, and the reform caused relatively few problems. A 2000 study found that lifting the ban on gay service did not have any negative effects on the ADF's morale, effectiveness or recruitment and retention, and may have led to increased productivity and improved working environments.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to {{him to be a}} disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule <b>change</b> <b>at</b> the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.|$|E

5|$|In March 1939, Aberdeen {{changed the}} black and gold colours to red and white, {{reflecting}} the silver and red colours of the official City of Aberdeen arms. The first red strips were worn with white shorts, with either red or white socks from 1939 until the 1965–66 season. In 1966, Aberdeen adopted red shorts, making the official kit all-red, {{similar to that of}} Liverpool, who made a similar <b>change</b> <b>at</b> around the same time. This arrangement has continued to the present day, with several variations in design, in common with most senior clubs as the replica shirt market has expanded. In the late 1970s an Admiral strip featured five vertical white stripes {{on the left side of}} the shirt and shorts, and the early 1980s shirts—as worn at the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup final—featured white vertical pinstripes. Later design changes included significant amounts of blue, and a one-season reversion to white shorts, although the all-red scheme returned in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s, sculptors Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Daniel Chester French {{lived and}} worked near the Square. By the 1920s, Washington Square Park was nationally {{recognized}} as {{a focal point for}} artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic <b>change</b> <b>at</b> NYU. Famed residents of this time include Eugene O'Neill, John Sloan, and Maurice Prendergast. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, and the realists Edward Hopper and Thomas Hart Benton had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when Allen Ginsberg and Bob Dylan settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time {{was in the midst of}} an aggressive facilities expansion phase. In 1975, the university opened The Grey Art Gallery at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|Network Rail, in its July 2011 London & South East route {{utilisation}} strategy, {{recommended that}} all services from Herne Hill towards Blackfriars should terminate {{in the bay}} platforms at Blackfriars after London Bridge's redevelopment is completed in 2018 and the diverted Thameslink trains return there. Passengers from Herne Hill would then have had to <b>change</b> <b>at</b> Blackfriars to travel further north. Network Rail made this recommendation because more services will be using the route between St Pancras and London Bridge from 2018; sending trains from Herne Hill to the terminating platforms {{on the western side}} of Blackfriars (instead of the through tracks on {{the eastern side of the}} station) would have removed the need for them to cross in front of trains to/from Denmark Hill and trains to/from London Bridge at junctions south of Blackfriars.|$|E
