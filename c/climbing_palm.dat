For, as the Spanish soldiers ran from the English, one of them was caught in the innumerable hooks of the Croc-chien, and never looking behind him in his terror, began shouting, 'Suelta mi, Ingles!' (Let me go, Englishman!)--or, as others have it, 'Valga mi, Ingles!' (Take ransom for me, Englishman!)--which name the palm bears unto this day.|$|E

60|$|And such a ride! Falling {{water was}} everywhere. We rode above the clouds, under the clouds, {{and through the}} clouds! {{and every now and}} then a shaft of {{sunshine}} penetrated like a search-light to the depths yawning beneath us, or flashed upon some pinnacle of the crater-rim thousands of feet above. At every turn of the trail a waterfall or a dozen waterfalls, leaping hundreds of feet through the air, burst upon our vision. At our first night's camp, in the Keanae Gulch, we counted thirty-two waterfalls from a single viewpoint. The vegetation ran riot over that wild land. There were forests of koa and kolea trees, and candlenut trees; and then there were the trees called ohia-ai, which bore red mountain apples, mellow and juicy and most excellent to eat. Wild bananas grew everywhere, clinging to the sides of the gorges, and, overborne by their great bunches of ripe fruit, falling across the trail and blocking the way. And over the forest surged a sea of green life, the climbers of a thousand varieties, some that floated airily, in lacelike filaments, from the tallest branches others that coiled and wound about the trees like huge serpents; and one, the ei-ei, that was for all the world like a <b>climbing</b> <b>palm,</b> swinging on a thick stem from branch to branch and tree to tree and throttling the supports whereby it climbed. Through the sea of green, lofty tree-ferns thrust their great delicate fronds, and the lehua flaunted its scarlet blossoms. Underneath the climbers, in no less profusion, grew the warm-coloured, strangely-marked plants that in the United States one is accustomed to seeing preciously conserved in hot- houses. In fact, the ditch country of Maui is nothing more nor less than a huge conservatory. Every familiar variety of fern flourishes, and more varieties that are unfamiliar, from the tiniest maidenhair to the gross and voracious staghorn, the latter the terror of the woodsmen, interlacing with itself in tangled masses five or six feet deep and covering acres.|$|E

The lawn with its {{flowering}} shrubs, tiny specimens of which we admire in hothouses at home; the grass as green (for {{it is now the}} end of the rainy season) as that of England in May, winding away into the cool shade of strange evergreens; the yellow coconut palms on the nearest spur of hill throwing back the tender-blue of the higher mountains; the huge central group of trees--Saman, {81c} Sandbox, {81d} and Fig, with the bright ostrich plumes of a <b>climbing</b> <b>palm</b> towering through the mimosa-like foliage of the Saman; and Erythrinas {81e} (Bois immortelles, as they call them here), their all but leafless boughs now blazing against the blue sky with vermilion flowers, trees of red coral sixty feet in height. Ah that we could show you the avenue on the right, composed of palms from every quarter of the Tropics--palms with smooth stems, or with prickly ones, with fan leaves, feather leaves, leaves (as in the wine-palm {82a}) like Venus's hair fern; some, again, like the Cocorite, {82b} almost stemless, rising in a huge ostrich plume which tosses in the land breeze, till the long stiff leaflets seem to whirl like the spokes of a green glass wheel. Ah that we could wander with you through the Botanic Garden beyond, amid fruits and flowers brought together from all the lands of the perpetual summer; or even give you, through the great arches of the bamboo clumps, as they creak and rattle sadly in the wind, and the Bauhinias, like tall and ancient whitethorns, which shade the road, one glance of the flat green Savannah, with its herds of kine, beyond which lies, buried in flowering trees, and backed by mountain woods, the city of Port of Spain. One glance, too, under the boughs of the great Cotton-tree at the gate, at the still sleeping sea, with one tall coolie ship at anchor, seen above green cane-fields and coolie gardens, gay with yellow Croton and purple Dracaena, and crimson Poinsettia, and the grand leaves of the grandest of all plants, the Banana, food of paradise. Or, again, far away to the extreme right, between the flat tops of the great Saman-avenue at the barracks and the wooded mountain-spurs which rush down into the sea, the islands of the Bocas floating in the shining water, and beyond them, a cloud among the clouds, the peak of a mighty mountain, with one white tuft of mist upon its top. Ah that we could show you but that, and tell you that you were looking at the 'Spanish Main'; at South America itself, at the last point of the Venezuelan Cordillera, and the hills where jaguars lie. If you could but see what we see daily; if you could see with us the strange combination of rich and luscious beauty, with vastness and repose, you would understand, and excuse, the tendency to somewhat grandiose language which tempts perpetually those who try to describe the Tropics, and know well that they can only fail.|$|E
6000|$|To {{describe}} to you, therefore, the Botanic Garden (in which the cottage stands) {{would take a}} week's work of words, which would convey no images to your mind. Let it be enough to say, that our favourite haunt in all the gardens is a little dry valley, beneath the loftiest group of trees. At its entrance rises a great Tamarind, and a still greater Saman; both have leaves like a Mimosa- -as the engraving shows. Up its trunk a Cereus has reared itself, for some thirty feet at least; a climbing Seguine {83a} twines up it with leaves like 'lords and ladies'; but {{the glory of the}} tree is that <b>climbing</b> <b>palm,</b> the feathers of which we saw crowning it from a distance. Up into the highest branches and down again, and up again into the lower branches, and rolling along the ground in curves as that of a Boa bedecked with huge ferns and prickly spikes, six feet and more long each, the Rattan {83b} hangs in mid-air, one hardly sees how, beautiful and wonderful, beyond what clumsy words can tell. Beneath the great trees (for here great trees grow freely beneath greater trees, and beneath greater trees again, delighting in the shade) is a group of young Mangosteens, {83c} looking, to describe the unknown by the known, like walnuts with leaflets eight inches long, their boughs clustered with yellow and green sour fruit; and beyond them stretches up the lawn a dense grove of nutmegs, like Portugal laurels, hung about with olive-yellow apples. [...] Here and there a nutmeg-apple has split, and shows within the delicate crimson caul of mace; or the nutmegs, the mace still clinging round them, lie scattered on the grass. Under the perpetual shade of the evergreens haunt Heliconias and other delicate butterflies, who seem to dread the blaze outside, and flutter gently from leaf to leaf, their colouring--which is usually black with markings of orange, crimson, or blue--coming into strongest contrast with the uniform green of leaf and grass. This is our favourite spot for entomologising, when the sun outside altogether forbids the least exertion. Turn, with us--alas! only in fancy--out of the grove into a neighbouring path, between tea- shrubs, looking like privets with large myrtle flowers, and young clove-trees, covered with the groups of green buds which are the cloves of commerce; and among fruit-trees from every part of the Tropics, with the names of which I will not burden you. Glance at that beautiful and most poisonous shrub, which we found wild at St. Thomas's. {84} Glance, too--but, again why burden you with names which you will not recollect, much more with descriptions which do not describe? Look, though, down that Allspice avenue, at the clear warm light which is reflected off the smooth yellow ever-peeling stems; and then, if you can fix your eye steadily on any object, where all are equally new and strange, look at this stately tree. A bough has been broken off high up, and from the wounded spot two plants are already contending. One is a parasitic Orchis; the other a parasite of a more dangerous family. It looks like a straggling Magnolia, some two feet high. In fifty years it will be a stately tree. Look at the single long straight air-root which it is letting down {{by the side of the}} tree bole. That root, if left, will be the destroyer of the whole tree. It will touch the earth, take root below, send out side-fibres above, call down younger roots to help it, till the whole bole, clasped and stifled in their embraces, dies and rots out, and the Matapalo (or Scotch attorney, {85a} as it is rudely called here) stands alone on stilted roots, and board walls of young wood, slowly coalescing into one great trunk; master of the soil once owned by the patron on whose vitals he has fed: a treacherous tyrant; and yet, like many another treacherous tyrant, beautiful to see, with his shining evergreen foliage, and grand labyrinth of smooth roots, standing high in air, or dangling from the boughs in search of soil below; and last, but not least, his Magnolia-like flowers, rosy or snowy-white, and green egg-shaped fruits.|$|E

40|$|Tropical {{rain forests}} (TRF) {{are the most}} diverse {{terrestrial}} biome on Earth, but the diversification dynamics of their constituent growth forms remain largely unexplored. Climbing plants contribute significantly to species diversity and ecosystem processes in TRF. We investigate the broad-scale patterns and drivers of species richness {{as well as the}} diversification history of climbing and non-climbing palms (Arecaceae). We quantify to what extent macroecological diversity patterns are related to contemporary climate, forest canopy height and paleoclimatic changes. We test whether diversification rates are higher for climbing than non-climbing palms and estimate the origin of the climbing habit. Climbers account for 22 % of global palm species diversity mostly concentrated in Southeast Asia. Global variation in <b>climbing</b> <b>palm</b> species richness can be partly explained by past and present-day climate and rain forest canopy height, but regional differences in residual species richness after accounting for current and past differences in environment suggest a strong role of historical contingencies in <b>climbing</b> <b>palm</b> diversification. Climbing palms show a higher net diversification rate than non-climbers. Diversification analysis of palms detected a diversification rate increase along the branches leading to the most species-rich clade of climbers. Ancestral character reconstructions revealed that the climbing habit originated between early Eocene and Miocene. These results imply that changes from non-climbing to climbing habit may have {{played an important role in}} palm diversification, resulting in the origin of one fifth of all palm species. We suggest that, in addition to current climate and paleoclimatic changes after the late Neogene, present-day diversity of climbing palms can be explained by morpho-anatomical innovations, the biogeographic history of Southeast Asia, and/or ecological opportunities due to the diversification of high-stature dipterocarps in Asian TRFs...|$|E

40|$|Palms lack {{secondary}} growth so their primary vascular system is long-lived {{and must be}} minimally vulnerable to dysfunction. For water movement, the axial xylem must be well defended against cavitation. Climbing palms can be very long and represent a maximum solution to transport problems. How is this demonstrated in their anatomy? This article contrasts stem vascular anatomy in a canelike 2 ̆ 2 tree palm 2 ̆ 2 (Rhapis excelsa) with that in the American <b>climbing</b> <b>palm</b> Desmoncus and the Old World rattan genus Calamus. Rhapis, representing the basic classical palm vasculature, has a continuously integrated vascular system determined by branching of the axial (stem) system to produce leaf traces, bridges, and continuing axial bundles. Axial transport is favored over appendicular structures because leaves are irrigated solely by narrower protoxylem tracheids. Maximum stem vessel length is inherently limited by the leaf contact distance (LCD). Desmoncus is very similar except that interconnections involve more numerous bridges and axial continuity is less obvious. Both Rhapis and Desmoncus retain scalariform perforation plates in their stem vessels. However, Calamus lacks axial continuity because axial bundles extend distally into leaves as leaf traces but end blindly in a basipetal direction. The only interconnection is via narrow transverse commissures (not bridges). Calamus stem metaxylem vessels have simple perforation plates. Resistance to water transport can be calculated, based on axial changes in metaxylem vessel diameter and is very high in the climbing palms. The unique features of Calamus may relate to safety of the hydraulic system as much as its efficiency, with Desmoncus an intermediate condition more clearly based on the classical model of palm vasculature. Calamus may have also evolved to mitigate the limitation of vessel length determined by LCD. Further anatomical solutions to the climbing habit in palms are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Rattan {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} non-timber forest products (NTFP) in the Philippines. It is in great demand for furniture and handicrafts for local and overseas markets. The country’s exports of rattan furniture alone averaged US$ 119 million per year from 1994 - 1998. Rattan is a <b>climbing</b> <b>palm</b> with unique physical and mechanical properties. It is light and has good strength properties but the main attribute of the material that influences product designs and quality, whether in round pole or split form, is its flexibility. Round poles can be bent into various forms and shapes for the structural and decorative components of rattan furniture and handicrafts. The bending of rattan poles into the desired shape is traditionally done with a blowtorch. This process produces scorch or burn marks on the surface of the bent items and this consequently degrades product quality and value. The most efficient bending method involves plasticizing the stocks for a suitable period in a steaming chamber prior to bending to the required shape with the aid of appropriate bending jigs. After this the bent pieces are dried to the required moisture content in restrained mode before product assembly. This is referred to as “steam bending”. The main equipment for steam-bending rattan poles that served as the model for this TOTEM was located inside the plant site at the Asia Rattan Manufacturing Company (ARMC), one of the four privately owned organizations that compose the AWECA group of companies based in Angeles City, Central Luzon. The ARMC and its sister companies have been the major beneficiaries of the technology transfer program of the FPRDI on rattan processing since 1987.
