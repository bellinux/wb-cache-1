50|$|Another {{variation}} of the modern Babe Bee. These were pretty good {{because they have a}} <b>choke</b> <b>tube</b> attached to the grey plastic backplate. The <b>choke</b> <b>tube</b> makes the engine even easier to start. They were fitted to the very last RTFs (e.g. PT19 and Hyper Viper) before they went out of production.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of <b>choke</b> <b>tubes,</b> the amount of choke for each barrel is usually stamped {{on the side of}} the <b>choke</b> <b>tube,</b> or there may be thin slots cut in the exposed rim of the tube at the barrel opening with the number of slots {{corresponding}} to the number of *'s in this table. (The 4 wider slots present in the exposed rim of the tube are intended for use with a choke wrench, in the event a <b>choke</b> <b>tube</b> ever becomes stuck in the barrel, and have no relationship to the amount of choke.) ...|$|R
50|$|SLP {{shotguns}} {{are shipped}} with a locking device and keys, a Standard Invector improved cylinder and modified <b>choke</b> <b>tubes,</b> a <b>choke</b> <b>tube</b> wrench, two active valve pistons (one for heavy loads {{and one for}} light loads), three interchangeable cheekpieces (with Tactical model only), three interchangeable recoil pads (with Tactical model only), and an owner's manual.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} model {{produced from}} 1947-1948. It had a plain one-piece pistol grip stock. The gun was distributed with two <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> (modified and full), which mount by screwing {{to the outside}} of the barrel, as opposed to the inside, like the Remington 870 or other modern shotguns. The shotgun was shipped with a wrench for removing the <b>choke</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In practice, <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> {{tighter than}} [...] "Full", such as [...] "Turkey", are also {{commonly}} marked with {{but a single}} thin notch {{on the end of}} the tube. Hence, to distinguish between [...] "Full" [...] vs. even tighter chokes, such as [...] "Turkey", it becomes necessary to measure the bore exit diameter of the <b>choke</b> <b>tube</b> to determine precisely which choke type is present among the [...] "Full" [...] and tighter (smaller diameter) chokes.|$|R
5000|$|Threaded barrel: Beretta-style barrel {{threading}} for <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> {{allows the}} UTS-15 to be adapted for any situation {{and a range}} of attachments.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} model {{produced from}} 1947-1950. The gun was distributed with three <b>choke</b> <b>tubes,</b> which mount by screwing {{to the outside}} of the barrel, as opposed to the inside, like the Remington 870 or other modern shotguns. The shotgun was shipped with a wrench for removing the <b>choke</b> <b>tubes.</b> Due to the early year of manufacture many of the models produced do not have a serial number, and the magazines have become considerably more scarce in all variants.|$|R
50|$|The SPR100 Sporting {{model has}} a {{nickel-plated}} receiver, walnut stock and fore-end, and screw-in <b>choke</b> <b>tubes.</b> The barrel is ported to reduce felt recoil.|$|R
5000|$|A tuyere or tuyère ( [...] ; [...] ) is a <b>tube,</b> <b>nozzle</b> or pipe {{through which}} air is blown into a furnace or hearth.|$|R
50|$|An {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} SPR100 has a nickel-plated receiver, walnut stock and fore-end, and screw-in <b>choke</b> <b>tubes.</b> This variant is a 12 gauge with a -inch barrel.|$|R
50|$|The barrels come {{threaded}} with a Tru-Choke thread {{pattern and}} two flush-mount spreader <b>choke</b> <b>tubes.</b> There are two optional chokes from the manufacturer, the doorbuster tactical choke and stiletto choke.|$|R
5000|$|... 7.5" [...] Barrel Extension: {{machined}} from 4140 ordnance {{grade steel}} with a matte black oxide finish. This attachment is threaded to screw into the UTS-15 barrel (like the Tactical <b>Choke</b> <b>Tube).</b>|$|R
50|$|The marking {{is usually}} stamped on the {{underside}} of the barrel for older guns without <b>choke</b> <b>tubes,</b> or is spelled out in abbreviated text on the barrel near the gauge marking.|$|R
5000|$|... (Common to the United Kingdom) 21-1/2" [...] as a {{one piece}} barrel {{converted}} to a 24" [...] UK legal barrel. This barrel adds with a 2.5 in <b>choke</b> <b>tube</b> brazed or silver-soldered in place).|$|R
5000|$|Only {{produced}} in 12 gauge, the chambers are three inches in length, to accommodate either 2¾ inch or 3 inch shells. [...] The Gold Label uses screw-in <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> that are steel shot compatible.|$|R
5000|$|The SA-08 is {{available}} in six models. All 12 and 20 gauge models come with improved cylinder modified and full <b>choke</b> <b>tubes.</b> 12 gauge models weigh 6.75 lb and 20 gauge models weigh 6 lb ...|$|R
50|$|Beretta also {{redesigned}} {{their stock}} choke system {{by increasing the}} length of the choke inside the barrel for a more gradual constriction, without having to add to {{the length of the}} barrel like after-market <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> do.|$|R
50|$|Coach Gun Supreme - The Coach Gun Supreme has {{screw-in}} <b>choke</b> <b>tubes,</b> and {{is equipped}} with a recoil pad. It features an AA-grade walnut stock and fore-end. Different versions have blued, nickel-plated, stainless steel receivers and barrels.|$|R
5000|$|Many hunters {{hunt with}} shotgun slugs where rifle usage is not allowed, or {{as a way}} of saving the cost of a rifle by getting {{additional}} use out of their shotgun. A barrel for shooting slugs can require some special considerations. The biggest drawback of a rifled shotgun barrel is the inability to fire buckshot or birdshot accurately. While buckshot or birdshot will not rapidly damage the gun (it can wear the rifling of the barrel with long-term repeated use), the shot's spread increases nearly four-fold compared to a smooth bore, and pellets tend to form a ring-shaped pattern due to the pellets' tangential velocity moving them away from the bore line. In practical terms, the effective range of a rifled shotgun loaded with buckshot is limited to 10 yards or less. [...] Iron sights or a low magnification telescopic sight are needed for accuracy, rather than the bead sight used with shot, and an open choke is best. Since most current production shotguns come equipped with sighting ribs and interchangeable <b>choke</b> <b>tubes,</b> converting a standard shotgun to a slug gun {{can be as simple as}} attaching clamp-on sights to the rib and switching to a skeet or cylinder <b>choke</b> <b>tube.</b> There are also rifled <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> of cylinder bore.|$|R
50|$|About a {{year and}} a half after the Red Label was re-introduced Ruger quietly dropped the shotgun from its product line citing an {{inability}} to achieve revenue expectations. Accessories and <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> for the Ruger Red Label shotgun are still available from Ruger as of 2017.|$|R
50|$|Current Citoris feature {{screw-in}} Invector <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> {{to regulate}} shot patterns downrange and thus provide versatility for usage in hunting and target shooting. These {{can be used}} with either lead, bismuth, or steel shot. Older models had factory fixed chokes, and steel shot is not recommended for use with those.|$|R
50|$|Some newer 12 gauge and 20 gauge Citori {{models have}} back-bored barrels. These are barrels with {{slightly}} larger bore diameters. Their {{purpose is to}} improve shot patterns by reducing the friction of the shot charge on the barrel wall, while also reducing felt recoil. Models with back-bored barrels use Invector Plus <b>choke</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, an after market R/C throttle/choke {{has been}} {{developed}} for the [...]049 reed valve engines. This throttle {{is attached to the}} <b>choke</b> <b>tube</b> on Sure Start [...]049 engines and acts as a cold-start choke would on regular engines. The throttle was developed by Saras Associates and is being marketed through Cox International.|$|R
5000|$|Trapshooting {{shotguns}} can be adjustable. Stocks {{may have}} a [...] "Monte Carlo" [...] (fixed, raised [...] "comb") configuration and/or include a comb height adjustment, a butt plate adjustment for length, angle or both. Trap guns typically have longer barrels (750-850 mm, 30-34 inches), possibly with porting and featuring tighter chokes {{to compensate for the}} longer distances at which trapshooting targets are broken. The majority of trap shotguns built today feature interchangeable <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> as opposed to older guns which used chokes of a [...] "fixed" [...] constriction. Interchangeable <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> can {{come in a variety of}} constrictions and may use names such as [...] "modified", [...] "improved modified" [...] and [...] "full". Trap guns are built to withstand the demands and stress of constant and lengthy repeated use - hundreds of shots in a single day of events, whereas typical field guns are built to be lighter, carried afield and not shot in such quantity.|$|R
40|$|A {{conceptual}} design of an afterburner system for turbojet engines which {{may reduce the}} jet exhaust noise by approximately 10 decibels is presented in this report. The proposed system consists of an array of swirl-can combustors and jet dividing <b>nozzle</b> <b>tubes.</b> The <b>nozzle</b> <b>tubes</b> translate axially upstream of the swirl cans when not in use. Results of preliminary design calculations and photographs of a kinematic model as applied to a hypothetical turbojet engine are presented...|$|R
50|$|Field {{models are}} the basic {{sporting}} models. They are available {{with a variety of}} barrel lengths and finishes, and may be set up for waterfowl hunting, upland game hunting, turkey hunting, or shooting slugs. Most smoothbore models come with interchangeable <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> and vent rib barrels, while the slug models come with rifle sights or scope bases, and may have smooth cylinder bore or rifled barrels.|$|R
50|$|Another {{option is}} to use a rifled choke in a smooth-bore barrel, at least for {{shotguns}} having a removable <b>choke</b> <b>tube.</b> Rifled <b>chokes</b> are considerably less expensive than a rifled shotgun barrel, and a smooth-bore barrel paired with a rifled choke is often nearly as accurate as a rifled shotgun barrel dedicated for use with slugs. There are many options in selecting shotguns for use with slugs.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} models of Condor, with {{different}} features and in various gauges. The standard model has a grade-A walnut stock and fore-end, blued receiver and barrels, a single trigger, and screw-in <b>choke</b> <b>tubes.</b> It has a vented barrel rib and a brass bead front sight. It is chambered to use either 2-¾ inch or 3 inch shells. Opening the action automatically engages the safety mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|The Spartan 310 has {{a walnut}} stock and fore-end, {{automatic}} ejectors, and a ventilated barrel rib. It uses screw-in SPR <b>choke</b> <b>tubes.</b> By default, the bottom barrel fires first, but the shooter can select the top barrel to fire first by pushing the trigger blade forward when {{the gun is}} loaded and closed. [...] Opening the action automatically engages the manual safety, which {{is located on the}} tang behind the top lever.|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{sporting}} shotguns have interchangeable <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> {{to allow}} the shooter to change the spread of shot {{that comes out of}} the gun. In some cases, it is not practical to do this; the gun might have fixed choke, or a shooter firing at receding targets may want to fire a wide pattern immediately followed by a narrower pattern out of a single barrelled shotgun. The spread of the shot can also be altered by changing the characteristics of the shell.|$|R
50|$|The UTAS UTS-15 is a bullpup 12 gauge pump-action shotgun {{with two}} 7-round {{magazine}} tubes that can feed in an alternating or selecting pattern. The UTS-15 has a 28.3” overall length with an 18.5” barrel, chambered for 2½”, 2¾”, and 3” magnum ammunition. Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer, the UTS-15 weighs 6.9 lbs. Additionally, {{there is a}} top mounted picatinny rail for the mounting {{of a wide variety}} of both iron and optical sights, coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for <b>choke</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In practice, {{steel shot}} {{patterns}} {{as much as}} two chokes tighter for a given amount of constriction. In other words, a choke that patterns [...] "Modified" [...] with lead or bismuth shot would give a [...] "Full" [...] pattern with steel shot. To avoid excessive wear or grooving from occurring within chokes when shooting steel shot, many manufacturers recommend avoiding shooting steel shot in any chokes marked tighter than [...] "Modified", unless the <b>choke</b> <b>tube</b> is specifically marked as being safe for use with steel shot.|$|R
50|$|A modern shotgun slug {{is a heavy}} {{projectile}} made of lead, copper, {{or other}} material and fired from a shotgun. Slugs are designed for hunting large game, self-defense, and other uses. The first effective modern shotgun slug was introduced by Wilhelm Brenneke in 1898, and his design remains in use today. Most shotgun slugs {{are designed to be}} fired through a cylinder bore or improved cylinder <b>choke,</b> rifled <b>choke</b> <b>tubes,</b> or fully rifled bores. Slugs differ from round-ball lead projectiles in that they are stabilized in some manner.|$|R
50|$|The Red Label {{originally}} {{came with}} a blued receiver but later models came standard with a stainless steel receiver and two hammer forged barrels. The shooter can determine which barrel to fire {{by means of a}} selector mounted on the tang. The front sight is typically a brass bead. Early production models typically had fixed chokes but most Red Labels manufactured since the mid 1980s are tapped to accept screw in <b>choke</b> <b>tubes</b> for various purposes. The butt stock and forend are oil-finished American walnut with checkering on the grip and forend.|$|R
50|$|The {{weapon is}} based on the SPAS-12, and has similar pump-action/{{semi-automatic}} firing modes. In semi-automatic mode a gas piston drives a bolt carrier and rotating bolt. In pump-action mode the same components are driven by sliding the fore-end backwards. Pump-action mode is required to reliably fire low-pressure (less lethal) ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. Switching between firing modes is done by pressing a button above the foregrip, and sliding the foregrip slightly forwards or backwards. The barrel is chrome lined and features screw-in <b>choke</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Wingmaster - Blued steel {{with high}} gloss or satin walnut stocks. They {{have been offered}} in Skeet, Trap, and field configurations. Originally the basic Wingmaster was {{chambered}} for 2 3/4" [...] rounds and came with a fixed choke, and the 3" [...] chambered versions were designated Magnum models. Models built after 1986 offer the RemChoke Interchangeable <b>choke</b> <b>tube</b> system, and the 12 and 20 gauge versions are chambered in 3" [...] for either 2 3/4" [...] or 3" [...] shells. Prior {{to the introduction of}} the [...] "Police" [...] model 870, altered Wingmasters were popular among law enforcement.|$|R
