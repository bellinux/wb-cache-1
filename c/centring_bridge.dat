5|$|Pennsylvania Route 263 (PA 263) is a northsouth {{state highway}} located in {{southeast}} Pennsylvania. The southern terminus {{of the route}} is at PA 611 in Willow Grove, Montgomery County. The northern terminus is at the <b>Centre</b> Bridge-Stockton <b>Bridge</b> over the Delaware River in <b>Centre</b> <b>Bridge,</b> Bucks County, where it continues into Stockton, New Jersey as Bridge Street to an intersection with Route 29. It follows the routing of Old York Road, a historic road that connected Philadelphia to New York City, and carries the name York Road from the southern terminus to Lahaska and Upper York Road north of there. From Willow Grove to Buckingham, PA 263 runs mostly through suburban areas as a four-lane road, passing through Hatboro, Warminster, and Jamison. The route forms a concurrency with U.S. Route 202 (US 202) and narrows to a two-lane road, splitting with that route in Lahaska. From here, the route continues through rural areas to <b>Centre</b> <b>Bridge.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Centre</b> <b>Bridge</b> was {{originally}} called Reading's Ferry after {{the proprietor of}} the original ferry at this point on the Old York Road between Philadelphia and New York.

The fire was depicted in a famous painting by Edward Willis Redfield {{who lived in a}} farm house just north of the <b>bridge.</b> The current <b>Centre</b> Bridge-Stockton <b>Bridge</b> was completed in 1926.|$|R
