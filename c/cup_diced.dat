40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} the Smart <b>Dice</b> <b>Cup,</b> a novel {{interaction}} device aimed at gaming applications in smart home environments. The Smart <b>Dice</b> <b>Cup</b> {{is used in}} a similar way as a traditional leather <b>dice</b> <b>cup</b> to generate random numbers. Integrated accelerometers relate the shaking of the device to the resulting rolls of the dice. In addition to an autonomous stand-alone mode, where the Smart <b>Dice</b> <b>Cup</b> serves as self-sustained gaming system, the device is also capable of communicating with its surrounding environment serving as an input device for other pervasive gaming applications. ...|$|R

50|$|In Nuremberg, Germany, between 1531 and 1572, {{apprentices}} {{who wished}} to become master goldsmith were required to produce columbine <b>cups,</b> <b>dice</b> for a steel seal, and gold rings set with precious stones before they could be admitted to the goldsmiths' guild. If they failed to be admitted, then they could continue to work for other goldsmiths but not as a master themselves. In some guilds, apprentices {{were not allowed to}} marry until they had obtained full membership.|$|R

50|$|Round 4: During {{the final}} round, Boris and Wang Feng faced the {{challenge}} they competed last year. Boris {{did his best}} even to score one point for the German team. In the last <b>cup</b> of <b>dice,</b> Wang Feng gave the correct answer. However, Boris failed to recall the numbers in the cup Number 93.|$|R
50|$|Two dice {{and either}} a flat {{bottomed}} container with a lid or a <b>dice</b> <b>cup</b> are needed. This {{game is played}} by three or more players.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{each player}} has a cubilete (<b>dice</b> <b>cup)</b> to shake and toss the dice. This {{does not affect}} the course of the game itself, but most {{habitual}} players find it imperative.|$|R
2500|$|Singani is {{wildly popular}} at {{national}} festivals, most notably St John's Eve {{and the annual}} Virgen del Socavón carnival (Carnaval de Oruro). [...] Singani is also the traditional drink at weddings, religious holidays, birthday parties, and other celebrations. [...] A common pastime is to play “cacho”, a <b>cup</b> and <b>dice</b> game similar to yahtzee or generala, while drinking singani either as a penalty or reward depending on the players’ mood.|$|R
50|$|Dexterity {{skills are}} here {{seen to be}} skills which are not usually {{associated}} with other categories of object manipulation. Many of these skills use items not usually associated with object manipulation. Examples are <b>dice,</b> <b>cups,</b> lighters.|$|R
5000|$|In England, Pachisi was {{modified}} using a cubic die with <b>dice</b> <b>cup</b> and patented as Ludo in 1896, patent number 14636. [...] The Royal Navy (RN) took Ludo and converted {{it into the}} board game of Uckers.|$|R
40|$|This sheet {{written in}} English and Spanish compares {{pictures}} of everyday items to their equivalent in ounces and <b>cups.</b> Four <b>dice</b> equals 1 oz., a half large boiled egg equals 1 / 8 cup, {{a golf ball}} equals 1 / 4 cup, a computer mouse equals 1 / 2 cup and a baseball equals 1 cup. It also gives portion sizes of various foods appropriate for ages 1 - 3 years and 4 - 5 years...|$|R
50|$|While Sam {{is looking}} up the recipe, Bugs Bunny {{knocks on the}} door and {{explains}} that as he's one of the rabbits residing in the king's royal forest, he's come to borrow a <b>cup</b> of <b>diced</b> carrots. Sam just slams the door on Bugs and returns to the cookbook, only to discover that hasenpfeffer is a dish that includes a rabbit as one of the ingredients. Realizing who he just shooed away, Sam rushes out after Bugs.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the game folio, Hasbro also released Yahtzee to Go. It comes with a <b>dice</b> <b>cup</b> that stores the dice & contents. similar to the original Travel Yahtzee only without the apparatus. This is sold {{in tandem with the}} game folio.|$|R
5000|$|Sneaky Dice: Based on Liar's dice, players {{use their}} Joy-Con {{controllers}} as a <b>cup</b> and <b>dice.</b> Players can shake the controllers around to shuffle the dice, {{and they can}} re-roll up to 3 times. When the cups are lifted, the player with the highest number on their dice wins. However, as the number on a player's dice can only be detected by the opposing player through vibration, players may attempt to bluff their opponent, tricking them into shaking their cup and ending up with a lower number.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, Kansil {{completed}} work on {{a variation}} of Bridgette called 'Bridgette Showdown', and this game {{was introduced to the}} public in 2004. Bridgette Showdown uses additional equipment, notably bidding boards, <b>dice,</b> <b>dice</b> <b>cups,</b> and chips. All Bridgette games sold today contain both the Showdown variation and the classic game.|$|R
5000|$|The {{amount of}} {{specialized}} equipment needed is {{not dependent on}} the number of players. Games such as Liar's Dice make poor party games because each player needs a <b>cup</b> and five <b>dice</b> to start the game. By contrast, Yahtzee needs only one cup and set of dice regardless of the number of players (the basic Yahtzee game does have other practical limitations).|$|R
5000|$|This game {{is played}} with one dice and four pawns per player. <b>Dice</b> <b>cups</b> are optional, but most game sets include them. As in Pachisi, the aim is simple: players compete on leading their four pawns out of their nest, around the whole board, into the color track {{and up to the}} center of the board, chasing and [...] "eating" [...] each other in the process.|$|R
50|$|Each player (or team) {{has nine}} {{identical}} playing pieces, {{which are usually}} old coins. In any case, the playing pieces have to be stackable.Two six-sided dice are used. They are placed in a wooden <b>dice</b> <b>cup</b> which is shaken and then slammed down onto a dice pad, typically made of yak leather stuffed with yak wool, which forms {{the centre of the}} board, within the circle of shells.|$|R
5000|$|The game uses two {{standard}} six-sided dice, {{which are}} shaken in a bamboo cup or bowl by a dealer. The cup is then overturned onto the floor. Players then place their wagers {{on whether the}} sum total of numbers showing on the two dice will be [...] "Chō" [...] (even) or [...] "Han" [...] (odd). The dealer then removes the <b>cup,</b> displaying the <b>dice.</b> The winners collect their money.|$|R
5000|$|Typical Harappan pottery {{was found}} and the complex itself {{appeared}} to be a pottery workshop. Ceramic items found included roof tiles, dishes, <b>cups,</b> vases, cubicle <b>dice,</b> beads, terrecotta cakes, carts and figurines of a humped bull and a snake. [...] There were also beads and possibly ear studs made of steatite paste, faience, glass, carnelian, quartz, agate and black jasper. Little metal was in evidence. However, a broken blade made of copper was found.|$|R

5000|$|There also {{exists a}} red {{circular}} travel edition, {{which includes the}} dice and scorecards, {{as well as a}} collapsible <b>cup</b> and detachable <b>dice</b> holder. The bottom half of the case acts as a dice tray. It should be noted that this one uses a different logo from the standard one (the name of the game in uppercase with an exclamation point in front of a green oval) and it is sold outside of the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Wile E. Coyote {{leaves a}} {{telephone}} {{at the hole}} of his neighbor, Bugs Bunny. He calls, asking to borrow a <b>cup</b> of <b>diced</b> carrots. Bugs' whiskers twitch as he sarcastically looks at Wile's mailbox ("Wile E. Coyote - Genius"), and realizes what he's up against. He then mocks him: [...] "Are you in, genius? Are you in, capable? In, solent? In, describable? In, bearable?..." [...] Wile grabs Bugs and ties him to a stake {{as he prepares to}} cook Bugs, but Bugs gets the upper hand by hopping on the floorboards, setting off a wine cork that, after it ricochets around the room, triggers Wile's Murphy bed to open, which crushes the Coyote into the floor with only his head sticking out (All to the tune of Raymond Scott's Powerhouse). Bugs makes his getaway and hops back to his hole.|$|R
25|$|To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of cheating, most good quality backgammon sets use precision dice and a <b>dice</b> <b>cup.</b> This reduces the likelihood of loaded dice being used, which is the main way of cheating in face-to-face play. A common method of cheating online {{is the use of}} a computer program to find the optimal move on each turn; to combat this, many online sites use move-comparison software that identifies when a player's moves resemble those of a backgammon program. Online cheating has therefore become extremely difficult.|$|R
50|$|Dice {{stacking}} is {{a performance}} art, akin to juggling or sleight-of-hand, {{in which the}} performer scoops dice off a flat surface with a <b>dice</b> <b>cup</b> and then sets the cup down while moving it in a pattern that stacks the dice into a vertical column via centripetal force and inertia. Various dice arrangements, colors of dice, scooping patterns and props allow for many degrees of complexity and difficulty. Dice stacking is usually performed with canceled casino dice, as their square edges and heavy weight give them an advantage when being stacked.|$|R
50|$|Of the series, Modern Magic is best known. The book {{contains}} {{advice on}} the appearance, the dress and the staging of a magician. It {{then goes on to}} describe many tricks with playing cards, coins, watches, rings, handkerchiefs, dominoes, <b>dice,</b> <b>cups</b> and balls, balls, and hats, and concludes with a long chapter of miscellaneous tricks, including magic with strings, gloves, eggs, rice and some utility devices. The penultimate chapter describes large stage illusions, and the final chapter contains advice on routining a magic show, and more advice on staging.|$|R
50|$|Dice {{are thrown}} onto {{a flat surface}} either from the hand or from a {{container}} designed for this (such as a <b>dice</b> <b>cup).</b> The face of the die that is uppermost {{when it comes to}} rest provides the value of the throw. One typical dice game today is craps, where two dice are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to randomize moves in board games, usually by deciding the distance through which a piece will move along the board; examples of this are backgammon and Monopoly.|$|R
50|$|Round 9: They faced 400 <b>dice</b> in 100 <b>cups,</b> {{each had}} 4 dice in it. They memorized them, within 5 seconds for each cup. After memorizing the numbers, {{they were asked}} to name the numbers under five {{randomly}} selected cups. Both got all of the numbers asked correct. As the tie-breaker round, they had to repeat 20 further numbers of five further <b>dice</b> <b>cups</b> by writing on a board as fast as they can. Boris achieves this in just 20.9 seconds and is faster than Wang. However, Boris got one single number wrong; Wang repeated all of them correctly. Wang won Round 9.|$|R
50|$|Directed by Patrick Daughters, {{the video}} was filmed {{in a large}} tent in Los Angeles' Elysian Park in early February. Several days before filming, a notice was sent to Bright Eyes fans in the area {{inviting}} {{them to participate in}} the video as extras. Several extras were chosen to shout obscenities at the band, many of which are heard directly in the video. The audience was given a variety of objects to throw at the band, such as popcorn, hot dogs, glowsticks, fuzzy <b>dice,</b> <b>cups,</b> and licorice. Many of the objects hit the band members during filming, but no one was harmed {{during the course of the}} afternoon.|$|R
50|$|Precision casino dice {{may have}} a {{polished}} or sand finish, making them transparent or translucent respectively. Casino dice have their pips drilled, then filled flush with a paint of the same density as the material used for the dice, such that {{the center of gravity}} of the dice is as close to the geometric center as possible. All such dice are stamped with a serial number to prevent potential cheaters from substituting a die. Precision backgammon dice are made the same way; they tend to be slightly smaller and have rounded corners and edges, to allow better movement inside the <b>dice</b> <b>cup</b> and stop forceful rolls from damaging the playing surface.|$|R

Each of these cups was {{composed}} {{using the same}} seven geometric shapes. But the first cup is whole, and the others contain vacancies of different sizes. (Notice that {{the one on the}} left is slightly shorter than the other two. The one in the middle is ever-so-slightly wider than the one on the right, and {{the one on the left}} is narrower still.)Clipped square tangram paradox - from Sam Loyd’s book The Eighth Book of Tan (1903).|$|R
50|$|Fuller has {{published}} 15 collections of poetry, including Stones and Fires (1996), Now {{and for a}} Time (2002), Song and Dance (2008) and the recent The <b>Dice</b> <b>Cup</b> (2014). Chatto and Windus published a Collected Poems in 1996. His novel Flying to Nowhere (1983), a historical fantasy, won the Whitbread First Novel Award, and was nominated for the Booker Prize. In 1996 he won the Forward Prize for Stones and Fires and in 2006 the Michael Braude Award for Light Verse. He has also written collections of short stories and several books for children. His poem Ship of Sounds, illustrated with a wood engraving by the artist Garrick Palmer, was published in 1981 in an edition of 130 by The Gruffyground Press.|$|R
40|$|Gamble 1 is a {{test-bed}} for affective multiparty interactions {{which allows}} us to investigate social behavior of an agent towards users and vice versa. The CASA paradigm [9] claims that agents are regarded and treated as social actors. Whereas in 1 : 1 interactions it was shown that people tend to consider their ”traffic-rules ” of social interaction, we know little about scenarios {{in which more than}} one user is interacting with the same agent at the same time. 1. SYSTEM DETAILS The setting is a small turn-based game of dice where {{at least one of the}} player’s is substituted by an embodied conversational agent (ECA), the Greta 2 Agent ([1]). The game can only be won by deceiving the other players and by detecting such attempts from the other players. Imagine it is player one’s turn. He casts the dice, examines his cast without letting the other players know the result and announces a result. Player two may now believe him and cast the dice herself. In this case she will have to announce a higher result. If player two decides not to believe player one, the actual result is revealed. If the actual result is identical to the announced one, player two has lost this round, otherwise player one. This demonstration is characterized by a sophisticated combination of multimodal input and output devices that allow for an engaging and immersive interaction with other human and virtual characters. Figure 1 gives an overview of the architecture and the spatial setting of the system. In the current version, the players use a <b>cup</b> of <b>dice</b> with a USB-web cam mounted on top of it (Fig. 1 a). Thus, the game server which keeps book of the game progress, knows the actual result of the cast. The players announcement...|$|R
