40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} standard against which international school partnerships can be evaluated and assesses its applicability using the outcomes {{from a school}} partnership programme. The development of the 'successful school partnerships standard' for international links utilises a large literature review that incorporates good practice guidance and research into international partnerships. The study provides the UK educational context for international school partnerships and identifies areas where such partnerships can deliver school improvement. These educational drivers for school partnerships are mapped onto the 'successful school partnerships standard' {{to determine whether it}} provides a valid framework for comparing policy and practice. The 'standard' is assessed through its application as a means of evaluating to what extent the European-funded <b>Comenius</b> school partnerships <b>programme</b> can be deemed successful. The study builds an evaluation framework based on the 'standard' to assess the quality of the outcomes and impact of Comenius school partnerships and to consider whether the European-focused school partnerships differ in any important aspect from other global partnership programmes. Mixed methods are used to assess the secondary data from the <b>Comenius</b> school partnership <b>programme.</b> Key findings from the study include: 1. The 'successful school partnerships standard' provides a useful framework for comparing school partnerships against the educational landscape 2. Comenius partnerships demonstrate a close alignment with the 'successful school partnerships standard' 3. Analysis of the Comenius data identifies the programme as an effective vehicle to support the delivery of two major education initiatives: 3. 1 Developing a workforce with the necessary skills to live and work in a global economy: using the evaluation schedule the impact of Comenius school partnerships on learners is excellent 3. 2 Providing professional development for teachers: 75...|$|R

We draw on our personal experiences of a European Union (EU) project, Mathematics in the Making (MiMa) ([URL] (Project no. 539872 -LLP- 1 - 2013 - 1 -ITCOMENIUS–CMP) funded through the <b>Comenius</b> Lifelong Learning <b>Programme,</b> which was based on a primary school mathematics intervention in five EU countries - England, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Portugal. We use the writings of David Jardine and Peter Applebaum to aid our thinking. We point to how absorbing, extended practical work recognises our humanity and can provide purposeful spaces for meaning-making in mathematics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a project {{organization}} model at the schools which have participated in Comenius School Partnership Projects (CSPP), deriving from part of the EU's Lifelong Learning <b>Programme</b> <b>Comenius</b> action. Establishing a project organization at schools has been necessary, when considered that CSPP has had a two-year duration including considerable activities which should be achieved through effective cooperation and communication, as well as acquiring basic life skills and competences for active European citizenship. The study was organized in three dimensions: determining the scope of the Project, explaining organization process (structure, staffing, equipping) and building the CSPP organization model in accordance to findings derived from document analysis and literature. The organization model developed in this study consisted of six units that are education-training and Europe; reporting and data entry; results and dissemination; school-parent cooperation and relations between local organizations and society; communication and coordination; and monitoring and evaluation...|$|R

50|$|In October 2005 Prince Henry's Grammar School {{became the}} first school in the City of Leeds to be {{presented}} with the prestigious International School Award from the British Council, {{as a result of}} staff and student-led initiatives. Prince Henry's is actively engaged in the EU's <b>Comenius</b> <b>programme</b> and has links to partner schools around the world (including China and South Africa). This is in addition to its specialism in modern foreign languages (acquired in 1999). This status brings significant additional funding into the school to enable it to broaden the language-learning opportunities of its students and the local community. Students study at least one language (French or Spanish) with German available as a second language at GCSE level and Chinese, Italian and Polish are available as options for AS and A Level study. GCSE students also have Mandarin language tasters and several participate in exchange programs with China.|$|E
40|$|Teacher {{mobility}} is {{a process}} with old routes in the history, but its importance was emphasized {{only in the past}} 25 years, once education sector of member states became an important subject on European agenda. The interest for teacher mobility and as a result the great support provided emerged along with establishment of main priorities of European Union among which raising awareness of member states citizens about EU citizenships became a primary goal. In this order Lifelong Learning Programme Comenius was especially designed for the education area to offer the framework to schools‘ actors for participation in international mobility activities. Theoretical framework regarding mobility ―as a process of change affecting modes of behaviour or trajectories of individuals or social groups‖ was enriched concomitantly. Besides the positive achievements on the path of teacher mobility developments, there were met obstacles and limits discussed in the specialized literature on education and teacher mobility. On the other hand precise estimates on teacher mobility in Estonia comprising researches on affects and teachers‘ approach towards mobility are lacking. This research was carried out to identify the main factors affecting the decision making process of teachers from Estonian schools from Ida-Virumaa and Harjumaa to participate in international mobility activities in the frame of <b>Comenius</b> <b>programme.</b> Furthermore policy recommendations were made based on the findings in the study in order to decrease the negative impact of the identified factors on teachers‘ approach towards international mobility...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{impact of}} science and mathematics in society {{does not seem to}} mediate an increased interest or understanding of scientific ideas among young people. Furthermore, the decreased recruitment of young people to scientific courses and the small amount that choose to pursue a scientific career, reflect the general attitude towards science. The disciplinary tradition characterizes the national educational curricula/synopses in many European countries and is commonly used in schools. This makes the understanding of cross-curricular issues particularly difficult. It has previously been found that curriculum integration increases pupils’ engagement in school and stimulates the teachers. Teachers and teaching methodologies are among the major factors affecting young peoples’ attitudes towards learning. However, although a lot of results from research focused on teaching and learning processes have been published, teachers seldom make use of the research outcomes. The obvious approach to overcome these problems would be the use of integrated curricula and implementation of interdisciplinary teaching/learning materials in schools in close collaboration with in-service teachers. To increase pupils’ understanding and interest in science and to overcome the gap between the theory and practice a three-year European project Integrating Subject Science Understanding in Europe, ISSUE-project, was performed. The project involved institutions from six European countries and was supported by the European <b>COMENIUS</b> <b>programme.</b> This project had two main objectives: one was to create a close collaboration between the researchers and in-service teachers, and the second to produce the integrated teaching-learning sequences and to implement and evaluate these materials in more than one European country...|$|E
