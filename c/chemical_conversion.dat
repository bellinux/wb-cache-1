25|$|A biofuel is a {{fuel that}} {{contains}} energy from geologically recent carbon fixation. These fuels are produced from living organisms.

500|$|The {{science of}} conserving fossil remains {{was in its}} infancy, and new {{techniques}} had to be improvised {{to deal with what}} soon became known as [...] "pyrite disease". Crystalline pyrite in the bones was being oxidized to iron sulphate, accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble. When in the ground, the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening, but when removed into the drier open air, the natural <b>chemical</b> <b>conversion</b> began to occur. To limit this effect, De Pauw immediately, in the mine-gallery, re-covered the dug-out fossils with wet clay, sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings, forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons. In Brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling gelatine mixed with oil of cloves as a preservative. Removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with hide glue, finishing with a final layer of tin foil. Damage was repaired with papier-mâché. This treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage. In 1932 museum director Victor van Straelen decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation. From December 1935 to August 1936 the staff at the museum in Brussels treated the problem with a combination of alcohol, arsenic, and 390 kilograms of shellac. This combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils (with alcohol), prevent the development of mold (with arsenic), and harden them (with shellac). The fossils entered a third round of conservation from 2003 until May 2007, when the shellac, hide glue and gelatine were removed and impregnated with polyvinyl acetate and cyanoacrylate and epoxy glues. Modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage, or, for fresh specimens, preparing a special coating of polyethylene glycol that is then heated in a vacuum pump, so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethelene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil.|$|E

The specification is approved for use by all departments and agencies of the United States Department of Defense (DoD).

It has gained world wide use across many fields versus the more verbose ISO equivalent (i.e., ISO 8081:1985, Aerospace process, <b>Chemical</b> <b>conversion</b> coating for aluminum alloys, General purpose). Note that chromate conversion coatings {{have been used for}} over 50 years as treatment to coated or as-fabricated surfaces to boost corrosion resistance and provide a good basis for the subsequent application of paint.

The solution of barium chloride was passed tangentially over the membrane surface and reacted with a solution of K(2) SO(4) introduced through the membrane pores. The resulting supersaturation induced nucleation and particle growth on the lumen side of the hollow fibers. A specific technique was developed to measure crystal size directly at the outlet of the hollow fiber device by using EDTA as a neutralizing agent of crystal nucleation and growth. Concentrations of barium chloride and potassium sulphate were shown to influence mainly the CSD, the effect of inlet flow rates on the lumen and shell sides being less pronounced.
