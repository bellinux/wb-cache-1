40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{wage and salary}} {{differentials}} experienced by military retirees in their post-service second career in the <b>civilian</b> <b>labor</b> market. The 1990 Census of Population and Housing, Public Use Microdata Samples {{was used as the}} source of data. Log earnings regression models were specified and estimated to determine earnings differences between military retirees and two comparison groups. The effects of the number of weeks and hours worked, education, location and receiving retirement income were controlled in the earnings regressions. The results indicate the proportion of military retirees not in the <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> is substantially higher than the proportion of non-veteran civilians or non-retired veterans not in the <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> The data also reveals that retirees tend to work less weeks per year and hours per week. Finally, retirees earn on average $ 4, 347 less annually than both comparison groups. Thus, military retirees not only tend to work less but when they do work they tend to take jobs that pay less. The present value of the earnings difference between a retiree and a non-retired veteran is approximately $ 48, 534 (11. 38 percent) NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) autho...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of the current {{financial}} crisis on Canada''s potential GDP growth. Using a simple accounting framework to decompose trend GDP growth into changes in capital, labor services and total factor productivity, we find a sizeable drop in Canadian potential growth in the short term. The estimated decline of about 1 percentage point originates from a sharply decelerating capital stock accumulation (as investment has dropped steeply) and a rising long-term unemployment rate (which would raise equilibrium unemployment rates). However, over the medium term, we expect Canada''s potential GDP growth to gradually rise to around 2 percent, below the pre-crisis growth rate, mostly reflecting the effects of population aging and a secular decline in average working hours.

40|$|Based on the {{introduction}} of research theories about rural <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer at home and abroad, taking Liaocheng City as the representative of medium and small cities, transfer situation of rural <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> in Liaocheng City is discussed from several aspects, including the transfer of total <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> structure of <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> flow of regional <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> industry selection of <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> and income of <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> Combining with the situation of <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer in Liaocheng City, social benefits, including both negative and positive benefits, of <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer are analyzed. From the aspect of positive benefit, foreign labor is one of premier builders for in-flow area (city), fills in the structural lack of <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> and has made huge contributions to urban construction. Meanwhile, for out-flow area (village), transfer of surplus <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> can reduce the employment pressure in rural areas, increase the income of peasant households, and promote the development of rural economy. From the aspect of negative benefit, {{a large number of}} <b>labor</b> <b>forces</b> pouring into cities will bring pressure on the transportation and infrastructure, increase the instability factor of city, and cause difficulties in the management of city. At the same time, a large number of young <b>labor</b> <b>forces</b> work in cities, leaving only the old and sick in rural areas. This might become a hidden danger to the development of agriculture. Push-Pull Theory is used to analyze the socio-economic factors affecting <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer. Suggestions are put forward to reform the household registration system, to improve the cultural quality of rural <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> to develop rural secondary and tertiary industries, to promote the rapid and harmonious development of economic society in underdeveloped regions, and to provide scientific reference for the sustainable development of regional economy and the construction of new socialist countryside in Liaocheng City. <b>Labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer, Push-Pull Theory, Liaocheng City, China, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|R
