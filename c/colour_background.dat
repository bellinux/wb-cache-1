40|$|Background: Software {{product line}} {{engineering}} provides an effective mechanism to implement variable software. However, using preprocessors to realise variability, which is typical in industry, is heavily criticised, because it {{often leads to}} obfuscated code. Using <b>background</b> <b>colours</b> to highlight code annotated with preprocessor statements to support comprehensibility has shown effective, however, scalability to large software product lines (SPLs) is questionable. Aim: Our goal is to implement and evaluate scalable usage of <b>background</b> <b>colours</b> for industrial-sized SPLs. Method: We designed and implemented scalable concepts in a tool called FeatureCommander. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted a controlled experiment with a large real-world SPL with over 99, 000 lines of code and 340 features. We used a within-subjects design with treatments colours and no colours. We compared correctness and response time of tasks for both treatments. Results: For certain kinds of tasks, <b>background</b> <b>colours</b> improve program comprehension. Furthermore, subjects generally favour <b>background</b> <b>colours</b> compared to no <b>background</b> <b>colours.</b> Additionally, subjects who worked with <b>background</b> <b>colours</b> {{had to use the}} search functions less frequently. Conclusion: We show that <b>background</b> <b>colours</b> can improve program comprehension in large SPLs. Based on these encouraging results, we continue our work on improving program comprehension in large SPLs. I...|$|R

Both mouths and the surrounding flanges show striking and previously unreported peaks of reflectance in the ultraviolet, coupled with high long-wavelength reflectance responsible for the human-visible appearance of the gape. High ultraviolet reflectance {{is likely to have}} an important effect on the conspicuousness of nestling mouths, since contrast with the nest background is maximal in the ultraviolet. Furthermore, the dual-peak nature of the spectra suggests that gapes are avian non-spectral colours analogous to human purple...|$|E

40|$|Light {{is a key}} {{environmental}} cue {{involved in}} the entrainment and regulation of fish development and physiology. Species specific spectral differences in sensitivity {{are believed to be}} an adaptation to the species' ecological niche and therefore fish larvae are predisposed to perform better under specific light environments. This study investigated the effects of light spectrum including blue (455 nm), green (530 nm), red (640 nm) and white on larvae performances of two temperate marine species, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). In both species, larvae exposed to shorter wavelengths (blue and green spectrums) showed significantly enhanced growth in comparison to larvae exposed to longer wavelengths (red). However, green spectrum appeared to reduce survival rates for both species. Larvae performances in the <b>colour</b> <b>background</b> experiment differed between species with cod larvae survival enhanced when exposed to a blue background but growth performances reduced. No significant impacts of background colour were seen in turbot. The {{results of the present study}} highlight the importance of considering light environment in marine larvae rearing protocols to enhance larval performance and survival...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{production of}} Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in plant leaf tissues is {{a hallmark of}} a plant’s reaction to various environmental stresses. This paper describes an automatic segmentation method for scanned images of cucurbits leaves stained to visualise ROS accumulation sites featured by specific colour hues and intensities. The leaves placed separately in the scanner view field on a <b>colour</b> <b>background</b> are extracted by thresholding in the RGB colour space, then cleaned from petioles to obtain a leaf blade mask. The second stage of the method consists in the classification of within mask pixels in a hue-saturation plane using two classes, determined by leaf regions with and without colour products of the ROS reaction. At this stage a two-layer, hybrid artificial neural network is applied with the first layer as a self-organising Kohonen type network and a linear perceptron output layer (counter propagation network type). The WTA-based, fast competitive learning of the first layer was improved to increase clustering reliability. Widrow–Hoff supervised training used at the output layer utilises manually labelled patterns prepared from training images. The generalisation ability of the network model has been verified by K-fold cross-validation. The method significantly accelerates the measurement of leaf regions containing the ROS reaction colour products and improves measurement accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Presentation tools like PowerPoint® {{are used}} {{extensively}} (Park and Feigenson, 2013), {{but they are}} regularly criticised because they are poorly utilised (Schoeneborn, 2013). This research project was focussed on developing an integrated set of research-based guidelines, to help users enhance the application {{of these types of}} presentation software. The following steps were taken to develop these guidelines: • A cross-discipline investigation of previous research was used to develop an understanding of the way the human brain processes visual information. This knowledge, and information from more than 1600 sources, was integrated to develop a set of tentative principles within a Unified Design Model (UDM). This UDM addresses visual attributes that include complexity, <b>colour,</b> <b>background,</b> layout, array, typography, graphics and animation. By addressing these aspects of the visualisation together the complex attribute synergies were able to be assessed, so their interactions could be managed more effectively. • The validity of the tentative principles was assessed through an experimental program. These experiments tested a range of presentations and collected related viewer comprehension and impressions data, {{to determine the effects of}} differing visualisation techniques. Additionally, a subset of these presentations were tested through eye tracking experiments, to explore the effects of different visual treatments on viewer attention. The collected data demonstrated that the integrated tentative principles generally facilitated good viewer comprehension and impressions. This outcome showed that previous research on this topic could be conjoined within a UDM to provide a cohesive visual design methodology. However, some suboptimal principles were identified from the experiments. These aspects were consequently addressed through the development of updated design guidelines. These give an empirically validated basis for applying tools like PowerPoint®, to enhance comprehension, attention and viewer impressions. Additionally, these guidelines supply a framework for conducting future integrated research on visual design...|$|E
