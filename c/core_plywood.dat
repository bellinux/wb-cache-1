The fire response temperature of surface of steel tubes is measured and the axial compressive bearing capacity of the specimens after fire are tested and analyzed.

40|$|Fast growing sengon (Paraserianthes moluccana) {{is largely}} rotary-cut to produce veneer for <b>core</b> <b>plywood</b> production. In {{order to provide}} better {{information}} on veneer production and utilization, in this {{study the effects of}} wood juvenility and veneer thickness on lathe checks of rotary-cut sengon veneers were evaluated. Before veneer manufacturing, sengon logs were boiled at 50 oC and 75 oC for 4 and 8 hours respectively. The boiled logs were peeled to produce veneer of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, 2 mm in thickness. Lathe checks of veneers were measured on the loosed side at every 5 mm veneer length under an optical video microscope and their frequency, depth, and length were characterized. Twenty sampling points of 5 mm veneer length were prepared from each segmented ring of 1 cm width from pith to bark. Isocyanate resin adhesive were used to produce laminated veneer lumber (LVL) of 20 mm thick, which consisted of 24 -ply of 1 mm veneer thick, 14 -ply of 1. 5 mm veneer thick, and 11 -ply of 2 mm veneer thick, for glue bond and bending strength test. Results showed that wood juvenility and veneer thickness determined the frequency, depth and length of lathe checks for the sengon rotary-cut veneers. In general, the frequency of lathe checks of the veneer increases with increasing veneer thickness, and also increases from pith to bark. Boiling of logs before rotary-cutting could decreases the frequency of lathe check of the veneer. The results indicated that boiling of logs at 50 oC for 8 h and at 75 oC at least 4 h before peeling the logs could minimize the frequency of lathe check in manufacturing rotary cut veneer thickness of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, and 2 mm from juvenile wood of fast growing sengon. The frequency of lathe check affect significantly the glue bond and bending strength, in which the glue bond, Modulus of Elasticity (MOE), and Modulus of Rupture (MOR) decrease as the frequency of lathe checks increases.

40|$|Lightweight {{structures}} as sandwich {{panels are}} one of the innovation products to drive the future of the wood/plywood industry for the near future. Material consumption, thus environmental impact, is the driving factor to replace commonly used plywood panels with the plywood sandwich structures. The aim {{of this paper is to}} elaborate the design methodology for different <b>core</b> type <b>plywood</b> sandwich panels under the flexural loading. The methodology is based on sampling of the numerical experiments by the finite element code ANSYS and approximation of the response values of the four point bending tests. This methodology is a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques that are useful for the modelling and analysis of problems in which structural responses are influenced by several variables and the objective is to optimize these responses. The methodology is often referred to as metamodelling as they provide a model of a model, replacing the expensive simulation analyses during the optimisation process. Moreover, validations of metamodelling procedure for design of I-core sandwich panels with physical tests have been evaluated. The sandwich panels used in physical experiments were made of plywood outer plate and I-core filling strips and the bending properties have been tested according to EN 789. The structural flexural stiffness capacity and weight efficiency have been elaborated for the I-core sandwich panels by the metamodelling procedure. The design guidelines have been elaborated and validated with the physical experiments...|$|R

5000|$|Hardwoods are {{employed}} in a large range of applications, including fuel, tools, construction, boat building, furniture making, musical instruments, flooring, cooking, barrels, and manufacture of charcoal. Solid hardwood joinery tends to be expensive compared to softwood. In the past, tropical hardwoods were easily available, but the supply of some species, such as Burma teak and mahogany, is now becoming scarce due to over-exploitation. Cheaper [...] "hardwood" [...] doors, for instance, now consist of a thin veneer bonded to a <b>core</b> of softwood, <b>plywood</b> or medium-density fibreboard (MDF). Hardwoods {{may be used in}} a variety of objects, but are most frequently seen in furniture or musical instruments because of their density which adds to durability, appearance, and performance. Different species of hardwood lend themselves to different end uses or construction processes. This is due to the variety of characteristics apparent in different timbers, including density, grain, pore size, growth and fibre pattern, flexibility and ability to be steam bent. For example, the interlocked grain of elm wood (Ulmus spp.) makes it suitable for the making of chair seats where the driving in of legs and other components can cause splitting in other woods.|$|R
40|$|The {{simplest}} type of sandwich composite {{consists of}} two, thin, stiff strong sheets of dense material {{separated by a}} thick layer of low density material. The first major structure to incorporate sandwich panels was the Second World War "Mosquito aircraft" which consisted of a balsa wood <b>core</b> with <b>plywood</b> faces. The cellular materials used for sandwich core applications can generally be divided into two categories; honeycomb structures and polymer foams. Other cellular cores which exist are balsa wood and corrugated cores. Honeycomb materials generally have a hexagonal cellular shape, and are the core material of choice for advanced composites, In this thesis it was the aim to prepare open-cellular PolyHIPE foam core materials by the polymerisation of the continuous phase of a high internal phase emulsion (HIRE). To assess whether PolyHIPE materials are viable as core materials their flexural, compressive and shear properties were evaluated against the current commercially used core materials. It was shown {{that it was possible to}} improve the flexural, compressive and shear properties of a styrene/DVB PolyHIPE material by the addition of fibres to the material and the use of an optimised surfactant system (OSS). It was also shown that by the addition of monomers such as; butyl acrylate, 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate to the monomer phase that the compressive properties of the S/DVB material could be varied. It was also possible to prepare a fibre-free and fibre-reinforced resorcinol- formaldehyde-based material, which had greater compressive and shear properties compared to the styrene/DVB material. Also a PolyHIPE material containing poly (ϵ-caprolactone) diacrylate showed shape-memory properties and an elongated cell structure after deformation and cooling. This elongated cell structure could lead to possible anisotropic behaviour. Finally it was concluded that the best mechanically performing PolyHIPE materials prepared competed well with the shear and compressive strength of the commercial honeycomb and foam core materials examined.
