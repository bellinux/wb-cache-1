Its first section—a short stretch from MN110 north to State Highway 5, including the Lexington Bridge over the Mississippi River—opened in the mid-1960s. Even though the <b>connecting</b> <b>piece</b> of I-35W and I-35 at the southern terminus of I-35E in Burnsville opened in the mid-1960s, {{it was not until the}} mid-1980s that I-35E was completed south of MN110 at Mendota Heights and southbound through Eagan and Apple Valley, where there had been a missing link of I-35E for 20years. Construction was delayed by opposition from nearby residents in Burnsville and from environmentalists over the proposed alignment across Blackhawk Lake. The final plan involved a new alignment avoiding the lake, as well as a less complicated interchange at I-494 in Mendota Heights, eliminating access to MN55 that was part of the earlier plans.|$|E

The K-700s were also exported to the Comecon member—GDR imported K-700s starting from year 1968. The K-700 is a heavy four-wheel drive tractor-pulling force of 50 kN-class articulated and disconnectable rear wheel drive. The <b>connecting</b> <b>piece</b> of {{the front and rear}} frame part is movable about the vertical and the longitudinal axis, the steering takes place by lateral bending by means of hydraulic. It is powered by an 8-cylinder turbo diesel engine in V configuration with 215 HP. The K-700 1975 was the further development of K-700 A, including the disposal of the next larger fuel tanks (two tanks of 320 liter capacity) due to larger tires for better traction on. The K-700 A provided only a temporary solution. Also in 1975 a successor of K-700 appeared: the K-701. The K-701 has a 12-cylinder naturally aspirated diesel engine with 300 HP. The K-700 tractors were reliable, efficient, particularly large sized, handle well although the noise and vibration load on the driver was relatively high. In the GDR, its size in operations off the fields sometimes was cumbersome. Furthermore, the tractor's sheer size often resulted in soil degradation.|$|E

40|$|The sperm <b>connecting</b> <b>piece</b> is {{a complex}} {{structure}} that, from a mechanical perspective, appears {{to play a role}} in stabilizing the proximal part of the sperm tail. We report the three-dimensional structure of the intact bovine sperm <b>connecting</b> <b>piece,</b> revealing an intricate, asymmetrical architecture with the segmented columns held together by filamentous linkages. The columns fuse, at the proximal end, with each other into structures that form the centriolar vault, and at the distal end, with the outer dense fibers (ODFs). The grouping of the fibers into these structures is consistent with bending only in the plane of the head. Structures reminiscent of the proximal centriole were observed in the vault, while the association of a novel bar structure with ODFs 3 and 8 organizes the distal centriolar vault. It has been proposed that the elastic compliance of the <b>connecting</b> <b>piece</b> provides the underlying mechanism behind initiation of the sperm beat cycle and bend propagation. According to the basal sliding theory of sperm movement, distortion of the <b>connecting</b> <b>piece</b> may store energy that initiates a new beat. The intersegment linkers could serve as mechano-sensitive elements that regulate alternation of the sperm tail’s bending direction in the beat cycle in addition to providing structural stabilization for the <b>connecting</b> <b>piece</b> segmented structures. On the other hand, our video recordings of the bull sperm movement show little bending of the head with respect to the tail, so it appears that there may be normally little strain within the <b>connecting</b> <b>piece.</b> axoneme, centriole, electron cryotomography, flagella, outer dense fiber, sperm nec...|$|E
