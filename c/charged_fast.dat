Smith was also chosen to play in both of college football's post-season All-Star games. In December 1935, he was picked {{as one of the}} Eastern All-Stars to play in the East-West Shrine Game in San Francisco. [...] And in July 1936, he was voted by fans as a starting tackle for the College All-Stars in the annual game between the college stars and the NFL championship team—the 1935 Detroit Lions. [...] In selecting Smith as an All-American, the NEA noted that Smith <b>charged</b> <b>fast,</b> had good speed down the field, and was a help to Minnesota's ends due to his speed. [...] Associated Press sports editor Alan Gould also cited Smith's combination of size and speed in picking him as an AP All-American: [...] "Dick Smith, a 218-pounder with rare speed in Minnesota's forward ranks get the call." ...|$|E
40|$|In ongoing {{electric}} {{pulse power}} driven inertial confinement fusion experiments, Marx generators are {{connected in parallel}} with the target {{in the center of}} a ring of the Marx generators. There the currents, not the voltages add up. Instead of connecting a bank of Marx generator in parallel, one may connect them in series, adding up their voltages, not the currents. If, for example, fifty 20 MV Marx generators are connected in series, they would add up to a gigavolt. But to prevent breakdown, the adding up of the voltages in such a super-Marx generator must be fast. For this reason, it is proposed that each of the Marx generators charges up a fast discharge capacitor, with the thusly <b>charged</b> <b>fast</b> capacitors becoming the elements of a second stage super Marx generator. In a super Marx generator, the Marx generators also assume the role of the resistors in the original Marx circuit. With a voltage of 10 ^ 9 Volt and a discharge current of 10 ^ 7 Ampere, the generation of a 10 ^ 16 Watt GeV proton beam becomes possible, which can ignite in liquid deuterium a thermonuclear micro-detonation.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of manufactured TiO 2 nanoparticles is studied {{in a systematic}} way in presence of alginate and Suwannee River humic acids at variable concentrations. TiO 2 nanoparticles aggregation, disaggregation and stabilization are investigated using dynamic light scattering and electrophoretic experiments allowing the measurement of z-average hydrodynamic diameters and zeta potential values. Stability of the TiO 2 nanoparticles is discussed by considering three pH-dependent electrostatic scenarios. In the first scenario, when pH is below the TiO 2 nanoparticle point of zero charge, nanoparticles exhibit a positively charged surface whereas alginate and Suwannee River humic acids are negatively <b>charged.</b> <b>Fast</b> adsorption at the TiO 2 nanoparticles occurs, promotes surface charge neutralization and aggregation. By increasing further alginate and Suwannee River humic acids concentrations charge inversion and stabilization of TiO 2 nanoparticles are obtained. In the second electrostatic scenario, at the surface charge neutralization pH, TiO 2 nanoparticles are rapidly forming aggregates. Adsorption of alginate and Suwannee River humic acids on aggregates leads to their partial fragmentation. In the third electrostatic scenario, when nanoparticles, alginate and Suwannee River humic acids are negatively charged, {{only a small amount}} of Suwannee River humic acids is adsorbed on TiO 2 nanoparticles surface. It is found that the fate and {{behavior of}} individual and aggregated TiO 2 nanoparticles in presence of environmental compounds are mainly driven by the complex interplay between electrostatic attractive and repulsive interactions, steric and van der Waals interactions, as well as concentration ratio. Results also suggest that environmental aquatic concentration ranges of humic acids and biopolymers largely modify the stability of aggregated or dispersed TiO 2 nanoparticles...|$|E

30|$|Currently, two PEV {{charging}} modes {{are widely}} adopted: normal charging mode {{at home or}} parking lots with lower charging power level, and <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> mode at <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> stations with higher charging power level, the typical charging duration is 20 – 30  min [18]. Besides the charging power level, the characteristics of such two charging modes are also intrinsically different. When a PEV is driving to the destination but the SoC is too low to complete the rest trip, it should find a <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> station to get <b>charged</b> with the <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> mode as soon as possible.

40|$|This 1 -day {{workshop}} {{focused on}} phenomenological models regarding the specific {{question of the}} maximum energy density achievable in collisions at AGS, SPS and RHIC. The idea was to have 30 -minute (or less) presentations of each model [...] but not the model as a whole, rather then that strongly narrowed to the above physics question. The key topics addressed were: (1) to estimate the energy density in heavy-ion collisions within a model, and to discuss its physical implications; (2) to suggest experimental observables that may confirm the correctness of a model approach [...] {{with respect to the}} energy density estimate; (3) to compare with existing data from AGS and SPS heavy-ion collisions, and to give predictions for the future RHIC experiments. G. Ogilvie started up the workshop with a critical summary of experimental manifestations of high-density matter at the AGS, and gave a personal outlook on RHIC physics. R. Mattiello talked about his newly developed hadron cascade model for applications to AGS and SPS collisions. Next, D. Kharzeev gave a nice introduction of the Glauber approach to high-energy collisions and illustrated the predictive power of this approach in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the SPS. It followed S. Vance with a presentation of the baryon-junction model to explain the observed baryon stopping phenomenon in collisions of heavy nuclei. S. Bass continued with a broad perspective of the UrQMD model, and provided insight into the details of the microscopic dynamical features of nuclear collisions at high energy. J. Sandweiss and J. Kapusta addressed the interesting aspect of photon production in peripherical nuclear collisions due to intense electromagnetic bremstrahlung by the highly <b>charged,</b> <b>fast</b> moving ions. Finally, H. Sorge closed up the one-day workshop with a presentation of his recent work with the RQMD model. This report consists of a summary and vugraphs of the presentations...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} block of sodium channels by diethylamide and phenol, which resemble the hydrophilic tertiary amine {{head and the}} hydrophobic aromatic tail of the lidocaine molecule, respectively. Diethylamide and phenol separately mimicked the fast and slow modes of block caused by lidocaine. Experiments were performed using single batrachotoxin-activated bovine cardiac and rat skeletal muscle sodium channels incorporated into neutral planar lipid bilayers. Diethylamide, only from the intracellular side, caused a voltage-dependent reduction in apparent single channel amplitude ('fast' block). Block was similar for cardiac and skeletal muscle channels, and increased in potency when extracellular sodium was replaced by N-methylglucamine, consistent with an intrapore blocking site. Thus, although occurring at 15 -fold higher concentrations, block by diethylamide closely resembles the fast mode of block by lidocaine (Zamponi, G. W., D. D. Doyle, and R. J. French. 1993. Biophys. J. 65 : 80 - 90). For cardiac sodium channels, phenol bound to a closed state causing the appearance of long blocked events whose duration increased with phenol concentration. This slow block depended neither on voltage nor {{on the side of}} application, and disappeared upon treatment of the channel with trypsin. For skeletal muscle channels, slow phenol block occurred with only very low probability. Thus, phenol block resembles the slow mode of block observed for lidocaine (Zamponi, G. W., D. D. Doyle, and R. J. French. 1993. Biophys. J. 65 : 91 - 100). Our data suggest that there are separate sites for fast lidocaine block of the open channel and slow block of the "inactivated" channel. Fast block by diethylamide inhibited the long, spontaneous, trypsin-sensitive (inactivation-like) closures of cardiac channels, and hence secondarily antagonized slow block by phenol or lidocaine. This antagonism would potentiate shifts in the balance between the two modes of action of a tertiary amine drug caused by changes in the relative concentrations of the <b>charged</b> (<b>fast</b> blocking) and neutral (slow blocking) forms of the drug...|$|E
30|$|Therefore, it {{is obvious}} that the PEV <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand is unpostponable and uninterruptible, but the PEVs with <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand can be {{scheduled}} to get charged in an optimal <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> station. The <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> demand of PEVs can be considered spatially schedulable but temporally unschedulable. On the contrary, the normal charging demand is interruptible, which can be shifted over time, but the charging place is totally fixed. The normal charging time can be scheduled to consume the DGs optimally with minimal cost, which means the normal charging demand can be considered temporally schedulable but spatially unschedulable.|$|R

40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{traditional}} slow charging loads, random integration of large scale <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> loads will exert more serious impacts on the security of power network operation. Besides, to maximize social benefits, effective scheduling strategies guiding <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> behaviors should be formulated rather than simply increasing infrastructure construction investments on the power grid.

Then, a multi-objective optimization model of the <b>fast</b> <b>charging</b> service fee is constructed, whose service fee can be further optimized by employing a fuzzy programming method.
