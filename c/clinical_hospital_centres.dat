40|$|Today laser {{has become}} a {{standard}} tool in modern minimal invasive microneurosurgery and it is being increasingly used in functional neurosurgery as well. Lasers have found their full and exten-sive application for their capacity of acting on pathological tissues without direct contact, through relatively small craniotomy, and in deep hardly accessible regions. In accordance with worldwide experience in successful use of laser power in neurosurgical procedures, in 1986 laser instruments were introduced into clinical practice at University School of Medicine, Department of Neurosurgery, at <b>Clinical</b> <b>Hospital</b> <b>Centre</b> in Zagreb. Following the initial efficiency testing of Neodymium: Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser equipment on experimental animals, its application soon began in neurosurgical procedures, to be continued {{on a regular basis}} until the present day. The Nd:YAG laser, wich causes coagulation-al necrosis resulting in good hemostasis, has proved highly valuable tool in the surgery of copious-ly vascularised pathological processes. Its deep thermal effects (up to 5 mm in depth) make it prac-tically irreplaceable in surgeries where particularisation and extensive shrinkage of solid tumour is desirable at the highest possible radicality, and especially in pigmented and hemopigmented tissues, like for instance angioblastic meningeomas, hemangioma, glomus tumour, and a number of bloo...|$|R

STUDY DESIGN: The Cross-sectional study conducted at the Department of Orthopaedics, <b>Clinical</b> <b>Hospital</b> <b>Centre</b> Osijek. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The research included 50 patients under stationary treatment in hospital at the Department of Orthopaedics. The research instruments include a questionnaire containing demographic data and the standardised EuroQuol Research Foundation Questionnaire (EQ- 5 D- 5 L) consisting of five dimensions which include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain level and anxiety. RESULTS: The average score of the current health status before surgery was 67. 5 whereas post-operative health was rated 80 (p < 0. 001). After the procedure, a significantly higher number of respondents reported greater mobility levels, and lower pain intensity; fewer respondents reported feeling anxious or depressed (p < 0. 001), more respondents rated their self-care abilities higher (p = 0. 003), and felt improvements when performing usual activities (p = 0. 031).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} relationship between glaucoma progression and diastolic blood pressure. It was conducted on 64 glaucoma patients at the Department of Ophthalmology of <b>Clinical</b> <b>Hospital</b> <b>Centre</b> Zagreb in three years period. The patients were on anti glaucoma therapy and had mean intraocular pressure values under 20 mmHg. At the same time they were on antihypertensive drug therapy. Patients were classified according Glaucoma Staging System based on the perimetric indices mean deviation (MD) and Pattern Standard Deviation into stage 2 - 4 (moderate glaucoma) at baseline. Rate of visual field progression was calculated in db/year for MD in the last three visits. Patients were divided in 3 groups according to progression - stabile, moderate and progressive. There was no statistically significant difference between 3 groups in terms of intraocular pressure values at baseline and in follow up period. After reviewing their blood pressure, the progressive group showed a significantly lower diastolic blood pressure compared to both stable group and the group with moderate progression. There was no statistical difference between the group with moderate progression and the stable group in terms of diastolic blood pressure. Results suggest that greater risk of glaucoma progression is connected with lower diastolic blood pressure. Diastolic pressure values could be important as one of the risk factors for progression in glaucoma patients with controlled intraocular pressure values...|$|R

40|$|Albeit the {{aetiology}} of {{the respiratory}} distress syndrome (RDS) is well known, the paper shall {{demonstrate that the}} causes of RDS {{changed over the years}} 2006 and 2010. This retrospective study comprises analysis of the data collected from 60 newborns of over 32 weeks gestation with RDS in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Hospital</b> <b>Centre</b> in Osijek. The focus of the paper lies in the difference in the incidence of RDS over two research periods (2006 and 2010), the most common and possible causes of RDS in newborns of over 32 weeks gestation {{as well as in the}} potential changes in the aetiology over the two research periods. An increase in the incidence of RDS was established in 2010, but it was statistically significant only for newborns of gestational age of 35 1 / 7 to 36 6 / 7 weeks. The most common cause of RDS in both research periods was sepsis, which decreased in its share in 2010, whereas the incidence of asphyxia and complications during pregnancy increased. The new potential cause in 2010 was maternal thrombophilia. The share of unknown causes of RDS decreased, although not significantly so. The results of the research indicate that the causes of RDS changed over the observed periods and that further research should focus on thrombophilia and other complications during pregnancy with the aim of reducing morbidity and improving neonatal outcomes as well as further reducing the incidence of RDS with unknown causes in newborns...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a systemic}} inflammatory autoimmune chronic disease. In {{comparison with the}} overall population, mortality and morbidity of RA patients are increased due to cardiovascular diseases. There is increasing evidence that autoimmunity mechanisms are included in pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Isolated disorder of diastolic function can, even with normal heart contractility, lead to heart failure. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess diastolic function in RA patients and determine factors causing diastolic dysfunction. Material and methods. The study included 88 patients with RA treated at Rheumatology Department, <b>Clinical</b> <b>Hospital</b> <b>Centre,</b> Zemun. All the patients were thoroughly examined (clinical findings, laboratory and echocardiographic examination). All parameters of diastolic function (mitral and pulmonary flow) were measured. Results. In RA patients 98, 9 % had diastolic function disorder. This parameter had been changed prior to clinical signs of heart failure and decrease of ejection fraction. Indicators of diastolic function, velocities E, A and their ratio VE/VA, as well as velocities S, D and their ratio VS/VD were lower in patients with positive rheumatoid factor. The patients' age (p< 0. 01), duration of the disease (p< 0. 05), high level of cholesterol (p< 0. 05), triglycerides (p< 0. 05) and arterial hypertension (p< 0. 05) were significant factors considerably affecting diastolic function. Conclusion. These findings suggest subclinical myocardial disorder in a great number of RA patients. Apart from early and aggressive treatment of the chronic inflammatory process, it is also necessary to prevent further heart complications by timely recognition and treatment of 'standard' risk factors for cardiovascular diseases...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in {{intensive}} care units (ICUs), causes infections with high morbidity and mortality rates. Tap water outlets are often contaminated with P. aeruginosa and may represent a source of endemic infections in ICUs. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the role of point-of-use (POU) filters in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in reducing P. aeruginosa colonizations/infections. Routine surveillance cultures, environmental cultures and samples from the hands of healthcare personnel, were taken and cultivated. P. aeruginosa isolates were identified according to standard procedures. For epidemiological purposes, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and pulse-field gel electrophoresis were performed. Data regarding use of antibiotics, disinfectants, antiseptics, gloves and gowns from 2006 to 2012 were investigated. In March 2008, in the NICU of the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Hospital</b> <b>Centre</b> Zagreb (CHC Zagreb), we observed an increase in the total number of pseudomonas infections compared to the previous months. This higher number remained the same until October, despite rigorous infection control measures. Pseudomonas isolates were found in tap water, but not on the hands of healthcare workers. In that moment POU filters were introduced. The number of P. aeruginosa isolates in surveillance cultures dropped significantly. The number of positive cultures of P. aeruginosa in two consecutive periods (before and after installation of POU filters) showed a statistically significant difference. After the implementation of all infection control measures, we managed to stop the spread of pseudomonas colonization/infection. POU filters contributed only as one of these measures, resulting in a reduction of chronically endemic P. aeruginosa infection/colonisation in the NICU...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim. Recent {{evidence}} indicates that surgical bleeding due to injured vessels and traumatic coagulopathy are the main reasons of uncontrolled haemorrhage in polytraumatized patients in the first 24 hours. The cornerstone of the treatment is adequate empiric early transfusion. The aim of our study was to survey the early transfusion in patients with major trauma and define the ratio of applied transfusion component in our hospital. Patients and Methods: Patients with major trauma for a one year period, admitted to the Emergency Department of the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Hospital</b> <b>Centre,</b> Zagreb, were enrolled in our retrospective study. The following data were collected: age, sex, mechanism of injury, initial shock index (SI), initial Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Injury severity score (ISS), and initial hemoglobin (Hb) and prothrombin time (PT). Intra-operative transfusion and transfusion within the first 24 hours of injury, Intensive care unit (ICU) stay and clinical outcome were assessed. Results. 16 patients with major trauma were admitted. Eight patients received transfusions. Two patients received a massive transfusion. The transfusion ratio of Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) : Packed red blood cells (PRBC) : Platelets (PLT) during major trauma resuscitation was 1 : 1, 5 : 1 in our study. One of the 16 patients died. Conclusion. Early and aggressive resuscitation with transfusion blood products in major trauma patients within the first 24 hours with the FFP:PRBC:PLT ratio 1 : 1 : 1 is the key for prevention of trauma induced coagulopathy and its lethal consequences. Massive transfusion protocol for major trauma patients should be implemented in everyday practice...|$|R

In addition to the general socio-demographic questions, the questionnaire included perception of 37 workplace stressors referring to: work organization and financial issues, shift work, opportunities for promotion, education, professional demands, interpersonal communication, communication between the healthcare workers and patients and hazards at workplace. The participants assessed their experience on the Likert scale from 1 =‘’Not stressful at all’’ to 5 =‘ extremely stressful Factor analysis yielded six factors of relatively high reliability of inner consistency (all values of Cronbach α exceeded 0. 7) : Workplace Organization and Financial Issues, Public Criticism, Hazards at Workplace, Conflicts and Communication at Work, Shift Work, Professional and Intellectual Demands. Discriminative validity of each factor scale was satisfactory: correlation factors range (items - scale) with corresponding scale was higher compared to correlation factors with other five scales. Individual particles logically explain the structure of the corresponding factors and provide good foundation for development of the measuring tool for perceived workplace stressors among hospital workers. All six scales were transformed to range from 0 to 100 were the highest value means the most stressful perception of the corresponding factor.

40|$|Decompressive Craniectomy (DC) is a {{treatment}} option for severe brain injury (SBI). This method is applied when {{the growth of}} intracranial pressure (ICP) {{can no longer be}} controlled with conservative methods. DC belongs to class III »Guidelines« – »option« which has not clear clinical certainty. They do not correspond to »Standards« (class I) in treatment protocol for SBI, which is common in most neurotraumatological centers. We have analyzed retrospectively 95 patients with SBI who were admitted to the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Hospital</b> <b>Centre</b> Rijeka. All patients were managed based on a protocol of current Brain Trauma Foundations (BTF) Guidelines. 39 patients underwent DC while 34 patients underwent standard craniotomy. 22 patients did not undergo any surgical procedures. In each patient we analyzed ICP changes within the first 11 days and in that way we correlated them statistically with the initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and then with Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), {{after the end of the}} treatment. We particularly analyzed the outcome with reference to the time of the operation and the size of DC. The standard measurement of ICP shows statistical significance in recovery in the group without DC after 5 days of intensive treatment, when the pressure is stabilized between 20 – 25 mm Hg. The stabilization of ICP in the DC group is observed already after 3 days of intensive treatment. Furthermore, better functional recovery according to GOS, which is statistically significant, was observed in patients who underwent DC where the area of craniectomy was larger than 25 cm 2, within the first 24 hours from the time of injury. The use of DC considerably reduces the need for CT check-ups. Increase in the number of encephalocele was noted, which is to be expected considering that dural decompression is used in DC procedure. The results of our study indicate that the utilization of DC is characterized with lower mortality and better functional recovery if it is applied at an early stage of treatment and if the size of DC is satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|This paper evaluates {{and compares}} basic {{emotional}} reactions towards the illness, {{as well as}} {{the quality of life in}} relation to the various types of treatment of isolated long tubular bone fractures of extremities in children and adolescents. This prospective clinical research comprehends 135 patients (94 males and 41 females), aged 10 to 18, treated for the mentioned bone fractures in the period from October 2003 till March 2005 at The Departments for Pediatric Surgery of three hospitals: the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Hospital</b> <b>Centre</b> in Rijeka (88. 8 % of the patients), the <b>Clinical</b> Children’s <b>Hospital</b> in Zagreb (9. 7 % of the patients) both in Croatia, and 1. 5 % of the patients in the <b>Clinical</b> <b>Hospital</b> in Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina). 53. 3 % of the patients were treated conservatively, 29. 6 % of them underwent the elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN), while the remaining 17. 1 % of the patients were treated with other surgical techniques (AO-plates or Kirschner-wire ostheosyntheses). The basic methods were self-reported questionnaires: the Spielberg State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI 1) to establish momentary anxiety and the Short Form- 36 Health Survey (SF- 36) to evaluate quality of life, i. e. the perception of the illness during treatment. The STAI 1 was administered twice to the patients: within 1 week of the experienced trauma (at baseline) and 6 months after the trauma, whereas the SF- 36 was administered only once, i. e. a month after the experienced trauma. Our results point at an increased anxiety indicators in all the patients immediately after the experienced trauma, mostly in patients treated surgically, especially those who underwent the ESIN method; whereas after 6 months from the experienced trauma the anxiety indicators were greatly reduced. The quality of life was better in patients who underwent a conservative treatment, both physically and mentally, than in those surgically treated. This points to the fact that the surgical method itself, despite its type, is an additional stressor which causes additional anxiety and depressive reaction. Our results suggest (from psychological point of view) that the conservative method of treating long bone fractures in children and adolescents should be used since it causes less emotional reactions on the illness ascertaining a better health experience during the treatment than the active surgical treatment (regardless of the type), which should be practised with criticism and according to strict surgical indications. If the surgical treatment should be necessarily adopted, we should take into consideration the possibility of psychologically preparing the patients in order to diminish the psychological reaction on the surgical treatment...|$|R
40|$|Drug overdoses are a {{major cause}} of {{mortality}} for drug users and, in many countries, are {{the leading cause of death}} in this group. The aim of the present study is to explore the frequency of all drug related deaths in the Split-Dalmatia County in the period between 1997 and 2007 and to analyze some of the characteristics of these deaths to help target preventive policies. The data on drug related deaths were collected using records from the Department of Forensic Medicine, <b>Clinical</b> <b>Hospital</b> <b>Centre</b> Split, University of Split, School of Medicine. There were 190 drug related deaths in the observed period of 11 years. Statistically significant difference (p= 0. 004, c 2 -test for trend) was found in the number of deaths in 1997 in comparison with the number of deaths in 2007. The majority of 105 (55 %) the decedents were 25 – 34 years old, and 92. 1 % (175) of them were male. There was a 94 % higher probability of mortality in the 25 – 34 years group (c 2 = 5. 55, p= 0. 064). Average age of all dead people was 31. 01 ± 7. 59 years (median 31. 0 years; range 18 – 49). Almost three quarters of the decedents were single and more than three fifths hadn’t been employed. The most common location of death was at home. Approximately, 80 % were autopsied followed by full histological and toxicological analyses. Out of all examined cases, the majority of drug related deaths (93 or 60. 8 %) were attributed to heroin. Heroin was the sole cause of death in 35 (22. 9 %) cases. Methadone was cause of death in 24 (15. 7 %) cases. 3. 4 -methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) deaths were rare (3. 3 %). Cocaine deaths were also rare (1. 3 %). Three fifths (55. 6 %) of the cases involved includes multi-substance use. During the investigation there was an evident trend towards multi-substance abuse patterns. These data suggest that interventions to prevent drug related mortality should address the use of drugs such as heroin and alcohol in combination...|$|R

40|$|Objective – The aim of {{this study}} is to show the effect of oxygen therapy in {{premature}} babies on the development of severe ROP. Ma-terials and methods – This retrospective research covered a period of two years, and included 108 premature babies, with birth weight < 1500 g and gestational age < 33 weeks, at the Children’s Ward of the University <b>Hospital</b> <b>Clinical</b> <b>Centre,</b> Banja Luka. The effects of the length of oxygen therapy and episodes of hypoxia and hyperoxia on the development of severe ROP were analysed. Results – ROP was present in 64 (59. 2 %) newborns, of which 21 (19. 4 %) had severe ROP. The incidence of severe ROP is statistically higher with lower birth weight, < 1150 g (p< 0. 01), lower gestational age < 30 weeks, longer oxygen therapy and when there were frequent episodes of hy-peroxia and hypoxia. By multiple logistic regression analysis, a very strong connection was established between severe ROP and exposure to episodes of hyperoxia (OR 32. 73; CI 4. 14 - 255. 37), episodes o...|$|R

The {{study was conducted in}} a tertiary care University <b>Hospital,</b> <b>Clinical</b> <b>Centre,</b> Kragujevac, Serbia, during August 2013, where the rationale of medicines prescribing was evaluated in eight cases. The administered medicines were assessed whether they were used in accordance with the recommendations by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines. Appropriate medicines such as aspirin were noted {{to be used in the}} management of the most cases and this was in conformation to these guidelines. Deviations from these recommendations included the use of vitamin supplements with antioxidant properties, iron supplements, antibiotics, benzodiazepenes, ranitidine, aminophylline and risperidone. An appropriate indication for administration of these medicines was not established. Additionaly, this study showed that there were instances where an inappropriate route of administration was used. All observed deviations from the recommended guidelines were not justified, and thus led to the inappropriate use of medicines and suboptimal care. These can be minimized by clear and precise diagnostic data and conformity to the NICE or other available national guidelines...|$|R
