However, despite the growing amount of research on WCF, {{there are a lot of}} aspects which have gone unnoticed, under-researched, or not researched. <b>Chandler</b> (<b>2003)</b> rightly underscores the fact that the existing data are not conclusive. The result of the methodological synthesis of research conducted by Liu and Brown (2015) revealed the need for more robust research. Similarly, Ferris (2010) highlighted the wide gap among research, theory, and real-world WCF practice.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDebate {{about the}} value of {{providing}} corrective feedback on L 2 writing has been prominent in recent years. According to <b>Chandler</b> (<b>2003)</b> meta-linguistic corrective feedback operates as the provision of the correct form in the student's written texts by underlining the error and writing the target form above it and directing the written corrections at errors in a specific structure. By comparing traditional direct error feedback with meta-linguistic corrective feedback the present study attempts to find out, whether experimental group will be more accurate than the control group or not. After conducting the experiment and analyzing the results through t-test, it was revealed that the experimental group subjects who were assessed and instructed through implementing meta-linguistic code-correction outperformed the traditionally-instructed control group in their post test...|$|E

40|$|Collocations {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in language proficiency but the effect of error correction feedback of collocations has not been thoroughly examined. Some researchers report the usefulness and importance of error correction (Hyland, 1990; Bartram & Walton, 1991; Ferris, 1999; <b>Chandler,</b> <b>2003),</b> while others showed that error correction was of little or no use (Leki, 1990; Truscott, 1996). However, teachers use error correction feedback of collocations most of the time in teaching even though it has not been proven whether there was effect on the improvement of collocation competence of EFL students or not. The researcher tried to investigate the effect of error correction feedback on various categories of lexical collocations (V+N, Adj. +N, N+N), and grammatical collocations (Adj. +Prep.,V+Prep., N) in this study based on Benson, Benson and Ilson's (1986) collocations model. The results revealed that error correction feedback was significant and had a positive effect on the collocation competence at advanced and intermediat...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} to what extent written corrective feedback (WCF) is a good way to treat errors that L 2 (second language) pupils make and if they attend to the comments in future written assignments. WCF is the most used response on written assignments. Some research takes the perspective that it is fruitful (<b>Chandler</b> <b>2003,</b> Ferris 2003) while other research argues that it is inefficient and unnecessary (e. g. Truscott 1996, 1999). This study presents the findings of a survey on the topic which was conducted at a small school in the south east of Sweden. A comparison between previous research and the findings of the present survey is made and the conclusion from this is that there are limitations in the efficacy of WCF and the results suggest that the type of feedback and how it is delivered are important. It is also likely to be beneficial that pupils revise their texts in order to improve in writing English. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of error correction {{is a central}} issue for the {{theory and practice of}} writing instruction. Particularly important is evidence regarding what can be called the Big Questions: whether correcting is better for the development of accuracy than not correcting and whether teachers should use correction. The latter question includes the issue of possible harmful effects on fluency and other aspects of writing. Evidence on these questions comes from comparisons between the writing of students who have received correction and others who have received little or none. It cannot come from research that compares one type of correction to another without showing how either compares to the lack of correction. Nor can it come from findings that corrected students improved in accuracy {{over the course of a}} study. Such gains could also result from other factors, such as writing practice, input obtained in the class, or outside exposure. Researchers who wish to attribute observed gains to correction must show that the other factors can be ruled out—by including a comparison group that received little or no correction. <b>Chandler</b> (<b>2003)</b> presents two studies on the effects of correction, neither of whic...|$|E

30|$|Joughin’s view of feedback, in the {{forgoing}} paragraph, is not {{far from}} the strong assertion of Truscott (1996, Truscott 2007) on the ineffectiveness of corrective feedback. Despite their negative stance, Ferris, etal. (Ferris & Roberts, 2001; Ashwell, 2007; Fathman and Whalley, 1990; Kepner, 1991) continue to hold high hopes that corrective feedback can help improve the writing skill of second language learners. However, second language scholars’ researches on writing reveal a“ constellation of moderating variables that could make a difference regarding corrective feedback effectiveness” (Russell and Spada 2006). The efficacy of corrective feedback (CF henceforth) has been a subject of much controversy (Truscott, 1996; Ferris, 2009 and which continues to generate an exchange of contrasting discourse between the advocates and non-believers of feedback correction, most especially the feedback which pays attention to grammar correction. In his article The effect of error correction on learners’ ability to write correctly, Truscott (2007)) examined the findings of <b>Chandler</b> (<b>2003),</b> Ferris (2003), Lalande (1982), et al., to find the best estimate of the overall effect of correction on accuracy and to determine an upper limit on how helpful correction might be through a meta-analysis, relying on the measure most widely used, Cohen’s d. The conclusion gleaned from his investigation revealed that the best estimate is that correction has a small harmful effect on students’ ability to write accurately and that he can be ninety-five percent confident that if it actually has any benefits, they are very small.|$|E
40|$|For many maize (Zea mays) {{producers}} {{across the}} Midwestern USA, {{as well as}} in parts of the northern and southern plains, the corn rootworm complex (Diabrotica spp.; Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) has represented one of the greatest challenges to efficient, quality maize-grain production over the past 50 - 60 years. Three species of corn rootworm are particularly troublesome: the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, the northern corn rootworm, D. barberi and the Mexican corn rootworm, D. virgifera zeae; all have consistently been important economic pests of maize (Metcalf, 1986 b). Prior to the introduction of transgenic maize varieties designed for corn rootworm management, from 8 - 10 million ha were treated with soil-applied insecticides to protect maize roots from larval feeding, with no absolute guarantee that the plants would be protected. Corn rootworms damage maize primarily through larvae feeding on the roots. Severe feeding can result in lodged or stunted plants due to substantial root loss (<b>Chandler,</b> <b>2003).</b> Over the years prior to the mid- 1990 s yield losses varied annually, but when the value of those losses was combined with the cost of control, these averaged at around US$ 1 billion per year (Chandler et al., 1998). Adult corn rootworms can also inflict damage to maize plants through feeding on silk and pollen. Large numbers of rootworms feeding on silk can substantially reduce pollination, which interferes with kernel set and reduces yield...|$|E

SCAR type 2 was congruent with F. meridionale, but contained the same PCR band size as SCAR type 5 (<b>Chandler</b> et al. <b>2003).</b> In this study, isolates of SCAR type 1 and most SCAR type 5 were confirmed as F. graminearum s. str. and F. asiaticum, respectively, by PCR–RFLP and phylogenetic analysis. Some F. asiaticum isolates were of SCAR type 3 and SCAR type 4, which has been reported elsewhere (<b>Chandler</b> et al. <b>2003).</b> Notably, the one F. meridionale isolate (Fanyuan 1 - 11) was determined to be SCAR type 5, rather than SCAR type 2. The unknown species isolate (Daya 272 - 3) was of SCAR type 2, but was phylogenetically closest to F. cortaderiae rather than F. meridionale. These results suggested that additional caution was needed to be taken to infer FGSC species by SACR types.|$|R

50|$|A recent {{research}} (Rourke, 2006) found that novice learners {{can still have}} difficulty understanding concepts if the given examples with incomplete or somewhat inaccurate information (known as faded examples) prior to acquiring basic domain knowledge or literacy skills in the subject matter. This is based on how novice and expert learner structure his or her learning schemas - knowing the appropriate procedure/approach to use in retrieving and interpreting the problem. On the other hand, worked out examples may constitute cognitive load and causing redundancy to learners with prior knowledge (Kalyuga, Ayres, <b>Chandler,</b> & Sweller, <b>2003),</b> in contrast with novice learners in which worked out examples rather serve as a compass that provides direct guides to solving similar problems (Rourke, 2006). This also apply when novice learners evaluate prototypes, which embody the main characteristics of a work, worked examples. This can also assist the novice learner with the semantic processing needed to fully comprehend {{a work of art}} or design (Rourke, 2006).|$|R
40|$|Instructional {{material}} {{provided through}} digital media and {{various types of}} educational technology {{may be able to}} support students {{with a wide range of}} learning abilities, providing better educational opportunities for a greater number of students. Technology-based instructional design, however, often does not take into consideration variation in student abilities. Research on Universal Design for Learning (UDL) promotes the idea of providing students with a variety of means of representation and expression. Investigations into cognitive load note the impact of the complexity of information content (intrinsic cognitive load) and the type of information presentation (extraneous cognitive load) on student learning. The work provided here is part of a larger effort to understand the influence of a student-centered approach to technology-based, instructional design in the field of high school chemistry. In the present study, results from a study by Carlson, <b>Chandler,</b> and Sweller (<b>2003)</b> of cognitive load were replicated in a digital media learning environment to determine whether the elements of cognitive load theory can be extended into design requirements for technology-based instructional materials. In a two-by-two experimental design, participants were required to learn contents in organic chemistry that was designed with either high or low intrinsic load and high or low extraneous load. Results were congruent with Carlson et al. (2003) and further support the following claims: (1) when compared to low element interactivity, high intrinsic load leads to decreased performance and higher subjective workload, (2) extraneous load reduction can promote performance gains and reduction in workload for tasks with high element interactivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is a {{collaboration}} between two teacher educators from a further education (FE) college and a university-based teacher educator who are exploring the use of modelling, a teaching method which can allow student teachers to ‘see’ into teacher practice, with in-service student teachers from the Lifelong Learning sector in England. This study adopted a second-person practice approach (<b>Chandler</b> and Torbert, <b>2003,</b> p. 142) in which I, the university-based teacher educator, discussed with the two teacher educators Loughran and Berry’s (2005) paper on peer-teaching as a prelude to them planning a class for a group of first year trainees, where a new teacher educator ‘modelled’ a teaching strategy and professional value and a more experienced teacher educator lead a ‘de-brief’ with the student teachers of the modelling. This approach sought to answer two research questions: Firstly, what happens when teacher educators work together to explore the pedagogy of teacher education and, secondly, what are student teachers’ perceptions of the use of modelling by their teacher educators. A diverse set of data was collected including transcriptions from the planning meeting, a film of the lesson, a focus group held with the student teachers after the class, a stimulated recall interview with the teacher educators and the teaching materials from the class. The data collected was then analysed using the conceptual framework of theories of practice architectures and ecologies of practices (Kemmis et al., 2014) and Winter’s (1982) concept of dilemma analysis. There are two principal findings arising from the study. Firstly, teacher collaboration is ‘messy’ (Adamson and Walker, 2011) and ‘beset by dilemmas’ (Winter, 1982, p. 168); secondly, the use of modelling assumes that student teachers already possess the required language, what Freire (1996) calls the ‘dominant syntax’, and theoretical knowledge to engage with a teacher educator as they ‘unpack’ their practice (Loughran and Berry, 2005) and this can either ‘sustain or suffocate’ its use as a teaching strategy (Kemmis, 2014, p. 50...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive load theory (hereafter CLT; see Sweller, 2006; Sweller, van Merrienboer & Paas, 1998; Sweller, 1994; 1988) {{has been}} used for nearly two decades to develop {{innovative}} learning formats in instructional design. It essentially draws upon some aspects of the information processing/schema theory approach to learning. The theory maintains that it is critical {{to take into account the}} limitations of our working memory if learning is to be efficient. Using hundreds of controlled empirical studies comparing conventional instructional formats to formats guided by CLT has generated positive results. These have been critically reviewed and generally accepted in the field of educational psychology. The use of CLT designed formats suggest there is less mental effort for the learner, a reduced training time, higher performance on test scores and transfer to similar problems, and longer duration for retention of information. The theory presents one perspective of our cognitive architecture. Among the many CLT instructional designs used, two concern individual differences and motivation. These are: 1. The prior knowledge of the learner (termed the expertise reversal effect - see Kalyuga, Ayres, <b>Chandler</b> & Sweller, <b>2003)</b> and 2. Mental rehearsal (termed the imagination effect - see Ginns, 2005; Leahy & Sweller, 2007; 2005; 2004). The expertise reversal effect is an interesting and counter intuitive effect explored by CLT where learners who have some prior knowledge of the instructional material may do worse, under certain conditions, rather than better than those learners with no prior knowledge. The second condition, mental rehearsal, is a learning strategy that {{has been used}} for many years (e. g. Sackett, 1934; 1935). It has been known variously by other terminology including "anticipative reasoning" (Dunbar, 2000) and "self-explanation" (Renkl, 1997). Since 1998, CLT has researched this approach in a series of experiments and termed it the "imagination effect". A number of motivational and cognitive issues have emerged that illustrate the conditions that make the strategy either viable or unproductive. One of the relevant limitations of CLT is that the experiments do not cater enough for individual differences of the learner. Important factors within the field of individual differences such as motivation, learning styles or gender for example are not adequately taken into account. This chapter will outline CLT, and then provide a summary of various experiments conducted within its theoretical framework. The experiments include exploration of the expertise reversal effect, the use of an imagination strategy (imagination effect) and unique work on CLT and motivation conducted by Paas, Tuovinen, van Merrienboer and Darabi (2005) and Paas and van Merrienboer (1993). From all of these studies, the chapter will identify some issues and limitations emerging concerning motivation and individual differences. New directions that may address these will be suggested. 16 page(s...|$|R
