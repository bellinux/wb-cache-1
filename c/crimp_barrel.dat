40|$|The {{techniques}} and hardware are described which were developed for facilitating {{the use of}} flexible flat conductor cable (FFCC) in commercial air transports. The system was designed as an evolutionary transition from the current round wire harnessing {{to the use of}} FFCC harnesses. The equipment discussed includes the pressure <b>crimp</b> <b>barrel</b> designed for terminating FFCC, reel-fed applicator, cable connectors and adaptors, and equipment racks...|$|E
40|$|Crimping is a {{mechanical}} joining technique to manufacture electrical connectors by squeezing the clip's <b>crimp</b> <b>barrel</b> onto the conductor. Primarily, crimped connections have to fulfill mechanical and electrical functions. The {{increasing number of}} electrical components in automobiles makes crimp connections very important parts, the reliability of which must be assured. Simulation of crimping process and operation is an efficient tool to optimize crimped connectors and {{to reduce the amount}} of expensive testing during development of new crimps. A three dimensional finite element model validated with crimp experiments is used to simulate the crimp process. Tensile tests on clip and wire material were performed to determine the parameters of the material models employed in the process simulations. The calculations lead to various process dependent results like crimp force, contact pressure and final stress state allowing to estimate the performance of the crimp connection. Thus, a significant reduction in cost and development time can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|This {{assessment}} was {{initiated by the}} NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) {{after a number of}} recent "high profile" connector problems, the most visible and publicized of these being the problem with the Space Shuttle's Engine Cut-Off System cryogenic feed-thru connector. The NESC commissioned a review of NASA's connector selection and application processes for space flight applications, including how lessons learned and past problem records are fed back into the processes to avoid recurring issues. Team members were primarily from the various NASA Centers and included connector and electrical parts specialists. The commissioned study was conducted on spacecraft connector selection and application processes at NASA Centers. The team also compared the NASA spacecraft connector selection and application process to the military process, identified recent high profile connector failures, and analyzed problem report data looking for trends and common occurrences. The team characterized NASA's connector problem experience into a list of top connector issues based on anecdotal evidence of a system's impact and commonality between Centers. These top issues are as follows, in no particular rank order: electrically shorted, bent and/or recessed contact pins, contact pin/socket contamination leading to electrically open or intermittencies, connector plating corrosion or corrosion of connector components, low or inadequate contact pin retention forces, contact crimp failures, unmated connectors and mis-wiring due to workmanship errors during installation or maintenance, loose connectors due to manufacturing defects such as wavy washer and worn bayonet retention, damaged connector elastomeric seals and cryogenic connector failure. A survey was also conducted of SAE Connector AE- 8 C 1 committee members regarding their experience relative to the NASA concerns on connectors. The most common responses in order of occurrence were contact retention, plating issues, worn-out or damaged coupling mechanisms, bent pins, contact <b>crimp</b> <b>barrel</b> cracking and torn seals. In addition to these common themes, responses included issues with markings, dimensional errors on the build, contact/socket damage (handling), manufacturing defects and customer misapplication and mishandling. The NESC team concluded that considering the large quantity and wide variety of connectors successfully flown on human and robotic space applications, the number of failures is quite low. However, "high profile" failures with significant cost, schedule, safety, and/or mission success impacts continue to occur. It was also concluded that connector failures occur throughout a system's life-cycle with the majority of connector issues application related. A number of recommendations were identified for improving NASA connector selection processes and overall space connector reliability and performance...|$|E

40|$|Goal of {{this work}} is the {{development}} of a new package to be integrated into large-area smart textiles. The benefits of the well-known crimp technology are transferred to a new field. The so-called Crimp Flat Pack (CFP) is a lead-frame based electronic package that features crimp terminals instead of standard leads. The module can be directly attached to different types of substrates, in particular to fabric circuits. Its size and complexity can reach from a simple two-terminal package to larger multi-terminal devices. The standard sized module has a circuit board area of 2 cm Ã— 2 cm and 10 crimp terminals. Eight of them are used for the communication between other modules and for mechanical attachment. Two terminals are used to attach a sensor that collects data inside the fabric. Mainly two tools were developed for the process. At first, a forming tool that bends the contact pins upwards and brings the <b>crimp</b> <b>barrels</b> into shape as well as the actual crimping tool that allows parallel crimping. On the system's side of view the module carries a simple micro-controller and passives. Communication between neighboring modules is done via I 2;C-protocol. Measurement of sensor date inside the fabric can be realized. The new package opens opportunities to the manufacturing of smart textiles as it uses standard manufacturing technologies as well as a robust, low-cost, and low-temperature interconnection technology...|$|R
