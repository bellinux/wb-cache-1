40|$|In this paper, I {{argue against}} a recent {{movement}} that advocates the <b>enhancement</b> of human <b>character.</b> It holds that <b>character</b> <b>enhancement</b> {{is a kind}} of rational self-manipulation, so there is no ethical wrongness in enhancing our character. It also says that many conventional arguments against enhancement (e. g. by US President's Council on Bioethics) rely on a conservative misunderstanding of the nature of enhancement technology. However, in my view, advocators of enhancement fail to capture the elements of the arguments of opponents of enhancement from three perspectives: (1) richness of life, (2) authenticity, and (3) mastery. First, advocators of <b>enhancement</b> hold that <b>character</b> <b>enhancement</b> does not decrease the richness of our life, but it can increase the possibility of living an enriched life. But their conception of the richness is shallow and very limited. The original concept of richness of our life that is intended by opponents of enhancement is deeper, wider and something that is impossible to put into words. Second, advocators of enhancement hold that it is no use arguing whether a certain character is authentic, because character changes naturally and gradually. So the point is whether one can admit the character as one's own. But the concept of authenticity that is used in the context of <b>character</b> <b>enhancement</b> need not be a literal authenticity, but it {{is a kind of}} "thick" concept that includes description and evaluation, and is conventionally defined by community. Third, advocators of <b>enhancement</b> hold that <b>character</b> <b>enhancement</b> is not an instance of the drive for mastery because it is only a rational self-manipulation, so it should be seen as a kind of conduct of self-decision. But <b>character</b> <b>enhancement</b> that includes changing the future self cannot be regarded as a selfdecision...|$|R

50|$|The {{design was}} also simple to modify {{for the sake}} of system {{expansion}} and enhancement. Many different modifications to increase the system clock speed were possible, including some that required nothing more than jumpers (e.g. the 3.5 MHz speed upgrade obtained by jumpering the clock divider, with no software modifications or changes to the ICs on the board.) There was also a minor industry in user-installable system upgrades such as real time clocks, 4 MHz upgrades, double density floppy upgrades, <b>character</b> <b>enhancements</b> for the display (reverse video, blinking, etc.), and the addition of hard disk interfaces such as SASI and SCSI. Most of these upgrades were accomplished through the use of daughter boards that plugged into existing IC sockets on the board, with the original IC either replaced by a more capable IC or placed into a socket on the daughter board.|$|E
40|$|Marijuana and {{abortion}} are two current social issues with potential for great societal consequence, {{not only in}} terms of life changing impact upon the individual, but upon wider society as a whole. Therefore attitudes toward the complete legalisation of these issues within Australia should be of great interest, i. e. what determines or influences a person 2 ̆ 7 s stance to these issues, and why? Previous research has established four main predictors of attitudes toward social issues; emotional reactions, religious identity, political orientation, and moral conviction. The current research seeks to determine what impact collective futures will have in predicting attitudes, i. e. dimensions of personality and societal change, and whether these dimensions contribute to attitudes on these issues in addition to these other predictors. One-hundred and thirty-six students from the University of Queensland completed an online survey assessing attitudes towards the legalisation of abortion or marijuana in Australia, together with measures identifying the bases for these views and the likely consequences for society into the future. This study found that collective futures significantly predicted attitudes towards the legalisation of marijuana {{and abortion}}. Specifically, dimensions of <b>character</b> <b>enhancement</b> and <b>character</b> demoralization predicted marijuana attitudes, whereas <b>character</b> <b>enhancement</b> and social issues predicted abortion attitudes. Furthermore, collective futures significantly predicted legalising marijuana attitudes after all other predictors had been taken into account. This research introduces the important role collective futures can play in predicting attitudes towards policies on current issues that have considerable impact upon society...|$|R

To achieve maximum enhancement, the morphology of PCSNPs need to be optimized. Here we precisely control the morphology of Au@TiO 2 PCSNPs and systematically study its influence on the plasmonic enhancement effect. Enhancement mechanism was found to vary with the thickness of TiO 2 shell. PCSNPs with thinner shell enhance the current due to plasmonic effect, whereas particles with thicker shell improve the voltage due to increasing semiconducting <b>character.</b> Wavelength-independent <b>enhancement</b> in the visible range was observed and attributed to plasmonic heating effect.

40|$|Semiconductor {{quantum dots}} (QDs) provide an {{essential}} link between light and matter in emerging {{fields such as}} light-harvesting, all-solid-state quantum communication, and quantum computing. QDs are excellent single-photon sources and can store quantum bits for extended periods making them promising interconnects between light and matter in integrated quantum information networks. To this end the light-matter interaction strength must be strongly enhanced using nanophotonic structures such as photonic crystal cavities and waveguides or plasmonic nanowires. So far it has been assumed that QDs can be treated just like atomic photon emitters where the spatial properties of the wavefunction can be safely ignored. Here we demonstrate that the point-emitter description for QDs near plasmonic nanostructures breaks down. We observe that the QDs can excite plasmons eight times more efficiently depending on their orientation due to their mesoscopic <b>character.</b> Either <b>enhancement</b> or suppresion of the rate of plasmon excitation is observed depending on the geometry of the plasmonic nanostructure in full agreement with a new theory.

40|$|Oral {{literature}} {{is a vital}} tool that is sometimes deployed by African writers for criticizing {{the social and political}} situations in their countries with the aim of challenging and proffering solutions to unpleasant and oppressive practices by its leaders. Femi Osofisan’s Many Colours Make the Thunder-King exemplifies this situation. It is observed that oral {{literature is}} not usually considered as a possible means of solving the social and economic challenges encountered in African countries. This paper examines Nigeria’s situation by focusing on the identifiable traditional aesthetics deployed in Many Colours Make the Thunder-King as a means of satirizing Nigerian leaders and also for possible re-construction of their <b>characters</b> towards <b>enhancement</b> of a better society. It is imperative for Nigerian leaders to learn and apply other strategies that would be useful in eradicating the hydra-headed challenges confronting the nation. This paper considers the application of oral literature, a possible means of solving the social-political and economic problems ravaging the country. The research methodology used for this study is qualitative. A sociological approach is adapted to evaluate the African oral aesthetics deployed in the literary text. This paper concludes and recommends that Nigerian leaders should go back to their traditional roots to seek the basis for economic, political and social innovation and progress if they are to succeed in developing the country...|$|R

40|$|Sosnowiec {{is located}} in the Katowice Region, which is the most {{urbanized}} and industrialized region in Poland. Urban areas of such <b>character</b> favor <b>enhancement</b> of pollution concentration in the atmosphere and the consequent emergence of smog. Local meteorological and circulation conditions significantly influence not only on the air pollution level but also change air temperature considerably in their centers and immediate vicinities. The synoptic situation also plays the major role in dispersal and concentration of air pollutants and changes in temperature profile. One of the most important are the near-ground (100 m) inversions of temperature revealed their highest values on clear winter days and sometimes stay still for the whole day and night. Air temperature inversions in Sosnowiec occur mainly during anticyclone stagnation (Ca-anticyclone centre and Ka-anticyclonic ridge) and in anticyclones with air advection from the south and southwest (Sa and SWa) which cause significantly increase of air pollution values. The detailed evaluation of the influence of circulation types on the appearance of a particular concentration of pollutants carried out in this work has confirmed the predominant influence of individual circulation types on the development of air pollution levels at the Katowice region.

40|$|Background: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is an excellent}} noninvasive technique to evaluate the female pelvis due to its high spatial resolution, excellent tissue contrast, and multiplanar imaging capability. Radiologists often evaluate {{a wide range of}} pelvic masses during routine clinical practice. Objective: Aim and objective of the study is to evaluate the importance of MRI in the pelvic masses and to characterize the MRI findings in female pelvic masses. Materials and Methods: We prospectively performed MRI in our institute in 58 patients which detected pelvic pathologies or pelvic masses on clinical examination and/or ultrasonography. These lesions were examined for size, shape, signal intensity, <b>character,</b> and postcontrast <b>enhancement.</b> Secondary signs such as ascites, lymphadenopathy, and invasion of the adjacent organs were observed. Results: MRI was significantly superior to ultrasound in the evaluation of the tumor extension, myometrium invasion, detection of lymph nodes, and parametrical involvement anorectal carcinoma. Overall accuracy for detection of lesion by MRI was 97 %, and sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignancy was 94 %. Conclusion: MRI is an excellent investigation to evaluate the female pelvic masses due to its high spatial resolution, excellent tissue contrast, and multiplanar imaging capability. It is a very good modality for the tumor staging and follow-up of the cases. Certain key imaging features of uterine or adnexal pathologies on MRI are helpful in the specific diagnosis or narrow down the differential diagnosis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the extension of}} some finite elements with embedded strong discontinuities to the fully transient range with the focus on dynamic fracture. Cracks and shear bands are modeled in this setting as discontinuities of the displacement field, the so-called strong discontinuities, propagating through the continuum. These discontinuities are embedded into the finite elements through the proper enhancement of the discrete strain field of the element. General elements, like displacement or assumed strain based elements, can be considered in this framework, capturing sharply the kinematics of the discontinuity for all these cases. The local <b>character</b> of the <b>enhancement</b> (local {{in the sense of}} defined at the element level, independently for each element) allows the static condensation of the different local parameters considered in the definition of the displacement jumps. All these features lead to an efficient formulation for the modeling of fracture in solids, very easily incorporated in an existing general finite element code due to its modularity. We investigate in this paper the use of this finite element formulation for the special challenges that the dynamic range leads to. Specifically, we consider the modeling of failure mode transitions in ductile materials and crack branching in brittle solids. To illustrate the performance of the proposed formulation, we present a series of numerical simulations of these cases with detailed comparisons with experimental and other numerical results reported in the literature. We conclude that these finite element methods handle well these dynamic problems, still maintaining the aforementioned features of computational efficiency and modularity...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Recently, the ATLAS and CMS {{detectors}} {{have discovered}} a bosonic parti-cle which, to a reasonable degree of statistical uncertainty, fits {{the profile of the}} Standard Model Higgs. One obvious implication is that models which predict a significant departure from Standard Model phenomenology, such as large exotic (e. g., invisible) Higgs decay or mixing with a hidden sector scalar, are already ruled out. This observation threatens the viability of electroweak baryogenesis, which favors, for example, a lighter Higgs and a Higgs coupled to or mixed with light scalars. To assess the broad impact of these con-straints, we propose a scheme for classifying models of the electroweak phase transition and impose constraints on a class-by-class basis. We find that models, such as the MSSM, which rely on thermal loop effects are severely constrained by the measurement of a 125 GeV Higgs. Models which rely on tree-level effects from a light singlet are also restricted by invisible decay and mixing constraints. Moreover, we find that the parametric region fa-vored by electroweak baryogenesis often coincides with an enhanced symmetry point with a distinctive phenomenological <b>character.</b> In particular, <b>enhancements</b> arising through an approximate continuous symmetry are phenomenologically disfavored, in contrast with enhancements from discrete symmetries. We also comment on the excess of diphoton events observed by ATLAS and CMS. We note that although Higgs portal models can accommodate both enhanced diphoton decay and a strongly first order electroweak phase transition, the former favors a negative Higgs portal coupling whereas the latter favors a positive one, and therefore these two constraints are at tension with one another...|$|R
40|$|PORPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of MR imaging in predicting dural, venous sinus, and perineural invasion by skull base tumors. METHODS: The preoperative MR images of 22 patients who had resection of skull base neoplasms were evaluated for the following characteristics: dural enhance-ment, pial enhancement, local perineural invasion by adjacent tumor, and venous sinus invasion by tumor. The greatest width of dural enhancement was measured, and the <b>character</b> of dural <b>enhancement</b> was noted. The pathologic and surgical reports were reviewed retrospectively with specific attention to dural, venous, and local perineural invasion. RESOLTS: Of the 22 patients studied, dural invasion by tumor was confirmed in eight patients, vascular invasion in six patients, and perineural invasion in four patients. The sensitivity of dural enhancement in predicting invasion was 8 B%, the specificity 50 %, and the accuracy 64 /o. When enhancement and focal nodularity were present, the sensitivity remained at 88 %; however, specificity was 100 % and accuracy 95 %. lf the dural enhancement was more than 5 mm thick, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 75 /o, 100 %, and 91 %, respectively. Predicting tumor invasion of the dura {{by the presence of}} pial enhancement was 50 % sensitive and 100 % specific, Venous sinus/jugular vein invasion was predicted with 100 % sensitivity, 94 % specificity, and 95 % accuracy. Local perineural invasion was predicted with 100 % sensitivity, 50 % specificity, and 59 % accuracy. CONCLOSIONS: The pres-ence of pial enhancement, focal dural nodules, or dural thickening of more than 5 mm is highly accurate in predicting the presence of neoplastic dural invasion. Linear enhancement of dura does not imply dural infiltration by tumor. Venous invasion by tumor can be predicted accurately with preoperative MR imaging...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{considers}} townscape {{change and}} the operation of conservation policies within two city centre conservation areas in Birmingham and Bristol during the 1970 s and 1980 s. The study combines character assessment of the two areas, from an urban morphogenetic perspective, and micro-scale examination of local authority planning application data to consider the impact of conservation management. Utilising the concepts and terminology developed by M. R. G. Conzen {{for the analysis of}} the townscape, the study identifies distinct units of townscape within the conservation areas. The use of an historical basis for conservation area character exposes the arbitrary nature of many conservation area boundaries, enclosing clusters of listed buildings rather than coherent areas of townscape. This approach also exposes the static nature of area character assessments based on architecture alone. These assessments provide an inflexible basis for <b>character</b> preservation and <b>enhancement,</b> one which under-values minor commercial and industrial heritage. While the influence of national economic trends, planning policies and architectural fashions produced a similar trajectory of conservation policy development in both areas, important local differences existed. Differences in the local office market and the extent of building listing produced contrasts in the 'success' of conservation policies. The high percentage of listed buildings in Bristol produced greater success in policy development and application than in Birmingham, by providing greater access to grant funds and the strength to sustain refusals at appeal. Consequently, in Bristol, contextual styles were used exclusively for new building from the mid- 1970 s onwards, and redevelopment using façadism was limited. This also aided the development of landscaping and building enhancement schemes, helping to tackle the erosion of character through minor change. In Birmingham, amid a pro-business climate and with limited listing of the Victorian fabric, the transition to contextual styles was more muted and façadism remained a key option for new commercial development. These circumstances also delayed and limited the development of enhancement strategies until the mid- 1980 s. In the late- 1980 s, rising commercial pressures exposed the weaknesses of conservation control in both areas. Limitations to their character assessments reduced the ability of the two areas to resist trends towards universal historicist styles for new building, and the use of standard 'corporate-heritage' elements for building interiors and exteriors. The lack of extra control offered by area designation for the regulation of interior and functional change reduced the ability of the local authorities to monitor and control the micro-scale processes of change, leading to further character erosion. ...|$|R
