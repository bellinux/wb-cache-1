500|$|In India, {{the golden}} jackal {{will take over}} the dens of the Bengal fox and the Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine,</b> and will use {{abandoned}} gray wolf dens. Most breeding pairs are spaced well apart and maintain a core territory around their dens. Den excavations commence from late April to May in India, with dens located in scrub areas. Rivulets, gullies, and road and check-dam embankments are prime denning habitats. Drainage pipes and culverts {{have been used as}} dens. Dens are [...] long and [...] deep, with between 1–3 openings. Young pups can be moved between 2–4 dens. The male helps with digging the den and raising the pups. In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, the burrow is located either in thick shrub, on the slopes of gullies, or on flat surfaces. In Dagestan and Azerbaijan, litters are sometimes located within the hollows of fallen trees, among tree roots, and under stones on river banks. In Central Asia, the golden jackal does not dig burrows but constructs lairs in dense tugai thickets. Jackals in the tugais and cultivated lands of Tajikistan construct lairs in long grass, shrubs, and reed openings.|$|E
50|$|The {{more common}} {{name for this}} species is the <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine.</b> The adult <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> has an average head and body length around 60 to 83 cm long, {{discounting}} the tail, and weighs from 13 to 27 kg.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There {{is great}} {{potential}} {{for the development of}} many new applications using data on mobile objects and mobile regions. To promote these kinds of applications advanced data management techniques for the representation and analysis of mobility-related data are needed. Together with application experts (behavioural ecologists), we investigate how two novel data management approaches may help. We focus on a case study concerning the anal-ysis of fauna behaviour, in particular <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines,</b> which represents a typical example of mobile object monitoring. The first technique we experiment with is a recently developed conceptual spatio-temporal data modelling approach, MADS. This is used to model the schema of the database suited to our case study. Relying on this first outcome a subset of the problem is represented in the logical language MuTACLP. This allows us to formalise and solve the queries which enable the behavioural ecologists to derive <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> behaviour from the raw data on animal movements. Finally, we investigate the support from a commercial Geographical Information System (GIS) for the analysis of spatio-temporal data. We present a way to integrate MuTACLP and a GIS, combining the advantages of GIS technology and the expressive power of MuTACLP. ...|$|R
50|$|Indian <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> have a {{very broad}} and mostly herbivorous diet. They consume a variety of natural and {{agricultural}} plant material, including roots, bulbs, fruits, grains, and tubers, along with insects and small vertebrates. Because they are cecal digesters, {{they are able to}} exploit low quality forage. They have also been known to chew on bones to acquire minerals, such as calcium, that aid in quill growth. Their capability to form substantial fat reserves is a useful adaptation for living in seasonally fluctuating habitats.|$|R

50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> is a {{terrestrial}} mammal; {{they very}} seldom climb trees, but can swim. They are nocturnal and monogamous. The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> {{takes care of}} the young {{for a long time and}} small family groups consist of the adult pair and young of various ages. In defense, when disturbed, they raise and fan their quills to make themselves look bigger. If continually bothered, the <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> will stamp its feet, whirr the quills, and charge the disturber back end first trying to stab the enemy with the thicker, shorter quills. These attacks are known to have killed lions, leopards, hyenas, and even humans.|$|E
50|$|The <b>crested</b> <b>porcupine</b> (Hystrix cristata), {{a typical}} {{representative}} of the Old World porcupines, occurs throughout the south of Europe and North and West Africa. It is replaced in southern and central Africa by the Cape porcupine, H. africaeaustralis, and in India by the Malayan porcupine (H. brachyura) and Indian (<b>crested)</b> <b>porcupine</b> (H. indica). The latter also lives throughout the Middle East.|$|E
40|$|Amongst mammals, femalebiased sexual size {{dimorphism}} (SSD) is {{rare and}} it occurs mostly in species where reduced male intrasexual competition is present. Reverse SSD {{has been reported}} for Old World porcupines Hystrix spp. We compared weight and six metric body measurements of 40 male and 42 female <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> from Southern Tuscany, Italy. No significant difference was observed between sexes. The monogamous mating system of porcupines, sharing parental care, together with no evidence of territoriality, militate against previous claims of SSD presence, probably due to small sample size and inappropriate statistical analyses...|$|R
50|$|Old World porcupines are stout, heavily built animals, with blunt, rounded heads, fleshy, mobile snouts, {{and coats}} of thick {{cylindrical}} or flattened spines, which form the whole covering of their bodies, {{and are not}} intermingled with ordinary hairs. The habits of most species are strictly terrestrial. They vary in size from the relatively small long-tailed porcupine with body lengths of 27.9 to 48 cm, and a weight of 1.5 to 2.3 kg, to the much larger <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines,</b> which are 60 to 83 cm long, discounting the tail, and weigh from 13 to 27 kg.|$|R
50|$|The Africa exhibit {{opened in}} 2009 {{after more than}} a decade of {{planning}} and two and a half years of construction. In this exhibit, the visitors walk around the main area on a boardwalk, and can see across the entire expanse of the enclosure. The main area is divided into two sections, the northern section containing giraffes and gazelles, and the southern section being home to zebras and rhinos. Lions have their own enclosure, as do the mandrills. red river hogs and colobus monkeys share a home, and the African <b>crested</b> <b>porcupines</b> and Aldabra giant tortoise also live together.|$|R
