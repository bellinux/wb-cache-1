5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, <b>chives,</b> dill and black pepper.|$|E

25|$|<b>Chives</b> have a {{wide variety}} of culinary uses, such as in {{traditional}} dishes in France, Sweden, and elsewhere. In his 1806 book Attempt at a Flora (Försök til en flora), Retzius describes how <b>chives</b> are used with pancakes, soups, fish, and sandwiches. They are also an ingredient of the gräddfil sauce with the traditional herring dish served at Swedish midsummer celebrations. The flowers may also be used to garnish dishes. In Poland and Germany, <b>chives</b> are served with quark cheese. <b>Chives</b> are one of the fines herbes of French cuisine, the others being tarragon, chervil and parsley. <b>Chives</b> can be found fresh at most markets year-round, making them readily available; they can also be dry-frozen without much impairment to the taste, giving home growers the opportunity to store large quantities harvested from their own gardens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Chives</b> are a {{commonly}} used herb {{and can be}} found in grocery stores or grown in home gardens. In culinary use, the scapes and the unopened, immature flower buds are diced and used as an ingredient for fish, potatoes, soups, and other dishes. <b>Chives</b> have insect-repelling properties {{that can be used in}} gardens to control pests.|$|E
25|$|In cold regions, <b>chives</b> die {{back to the}} {{underground}} bulbs in winter, with the new leaves appearing in early spring. <b>Chives</b> starting to look old can be cut back to about 2–5cm. When harvesting, the needed number of stalks should be cut to the base. During the growing season, the plant continually regrows leaves, allowing for a continuous harvest.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chive</b> is a {{perennial}} herb, growing also natural in Finland. Commercial {{production of the}} herb is very small in our country, but large amounts of <b>chive</b> are imported. This fact has aroused interest in investigating the opportunities of producing <b>chive</b> using modern cultivation techniques. Effects of cultivar, plastic mulch as ground cover and fertilisation on yield were studied in field experiments over three years. In the experiments, the most productive cultivars or populations (a Finnish population “Hankoniemi”, a Dutch population “Tavallinen” and a German cultivar ‘Grolau’) produced 10 – 20 % higher yields than the less productive cultivars. There were no clear differences in the yield quality between the cultivars. Black plastic mulch was effective in increasing yield, controlling weeds and maintaining soil moisture. For fertilisation, the experiments revealed the high nutrient demand of <b>chive.</b> After the basic soil fertilisation, weekly fertigation with a NPK fertiliser at a higher nitrogen dose (10 - 15 kg ha - 1 N per week) resulted in higher biomass production than fertigation with nitrogen alone and/or a half nitrogen dose. In the years following the planting, the annual uptakes in yield were 185 - 200 kg ha - 1 for nitrogen, 17 - 20 kg ha - 1 for phosphorus, and 120 - 140 kg ha - 1 for potassium in the most intensively fertilised treatment producing the highest yield. The results show that <b>chive</b> is feasible for commercial production with modern cultivation techniques...|$|R

40|$|<b>Chive</b> gnat, Bradysia odoriphaga Yang & Zhang (Diptera: Sciaridae), is {{the most}} serious pest of Chinese <b>chive,</b> Allium tuberosum. The present study aimed at {{determining}} the biocontrol potential of different indigenous entomopathogenic nematode (EPN) isolates for the management of <b>chive</b> gnat in China. The virulence of 145 EPN isolates belonging to 13 species against B. odoriphaga was evaluated in the laboratory, and then the most promising isolates (Steinernema ceratophorum HQA- 87; S. hebeiense JY- 82; S. feltiae JY- 90, JY- 17; S. litorale HXY- 68; Heterorhabditis indica ZZ- 68; H. bacteriophora NY- 63, HQ- 94; and H. megidis LFS- 10) were selected for further experiments. The mortality of fourth instar B. odoriphaga was significantly affected by nematode isolates and concentrations of infective juveniles (IJ). Third and fourth instars of B. odoriphaga were generally more susceptible to the nematodes than first and second instars and pupae. Pot experiments showed no differences in B. odoriphaga population reduction at 50 and 75 IJ/cm(2) of different isolates; the tested isolates caused a 78 - 94 % reduction of the <b>chive</b> gnat population at an application rate of 75 IJ/cm(2). In a field experiment, S. feltiae JY- 90 generated the strongest pest suppression 14 days after EPN application, whereas after 28 days pest densities in the plots treated with S. feltiae JY- 17 and S. hebeiense JY- 82 were similar to those in plots treated with phoxim and yielded significant reductions of the B. odoriphaga populations. Our findings indicate that EPN may have good potential for use in the integrated management of B. odoriphaga populations in Chinese <b>chive...</b>|$|R
