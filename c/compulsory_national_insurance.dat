The Act only applied to wage earners—about {{seventy percent of the}} work force—their families and the unwaged were not covered.|$|E

New Brunswick, Alberta and Quebec had held out against the federal government's desire to amend the constitution but ultimately acceded to its request, Alberta being the last to do so.

40|$|The <b>National</b> Flood <b>Insurance</b> Program (NFIP) was {{established}} in 1968 and requires mandatory flood insurance for property owners who have federally backed mortgages. Krutilla (1966) noted that a <b>compulsory</b> <b>national</b> flood <b>insurance</b> program could greatly improve the economic efficiency of flood plain occupancy in the United States. However, in order to realize the efficiency gains suggested by Krutilla, property owners must have sufficient information about flood risk and insurance premiums to make well-informed home purchase decisions. Using survey data from Boulder, Colorado, we find significant evidence of market failure in information in the NFIP program. The majority of survey respondents, all of whom live in a special flood hazard area, report they did not fully understand the degree of flood risk or the cost of insuring against this risk when negotiating the purchase of their property. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-This article reviews some of {{the salient}} {{features}} of the Belgian health care finance and delivery system. Special {{attention is paid to}} the role played by the third-party payers, i. e. the Health Insurance Associations (HIAs) in administering the <b>compulsory</b> <b>national</b> health <b>insurance</b> program. It is shown how, despite extensive government regulation, the markets for GP, specialist and hospital services exhibit fierce competition of the non-price variety. Next, the paper considers the three problems perceived to be the most pressing ones at present: (i) the problem of raising sufficient revenues to cover the public share of health expenditures; (ii) the (related) cost containment problem; and (iii) the problem of ensuring efficiency through appropriate incentive mechanisms. Finally, two recently proposed options for reform are discussed and complemented with a third proposal based on the ideas of regulated competition. It is concluded that strengthening the role of the third-party payers remains crucial in any attempt to reshape the system to make it efficient and affordable while keeping it equitable.

40|$|In April 2007, Australia {{introduced}} a risk equalisation (RE) scheme (de facto a claims equalisation scheme), which replaced an extant reinsurance scheme that had operated since 1976. This scheme {{is one of}} a number of policy measures that the Australian Government has instituted to support the voluntary private health insurance (PHI) market which is subject to mandatory community rating and the attendant problem of selection. The latter has been a persistent concern in the Australian PHI market since the introduction of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s universal, <b>compulsory</b> <b>national</b> health <b>insurance</b> scheme Medicare. This paper presents a brief overview of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s health care financing arrangements and, in particular, focuses on the history, structure and functioning of the RE scheme. It provides an exposition of the operation of the scheme and empirical evidence of the scheme 2 ̆ 7 s effects in its first full year of operation, 2007 - 08. The paper makes three contributions: first, it provides the only detailed overview of the functioning of the Australian RE scheme published to date; second, it presents the first empirical measures of the scheme 2 ̆ 7 s operation at the level of the 38 individual PHI funds; and third, it describes the systematic differences in the scheme 2 ̆ 7 s operation with respect to large and small funds. Thus, this paper provides a number of insights into the operation and outcomes of the Australian RE scheme following its first year of operation...|$|R
40|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, episodes of major health policy reform were {{relatively}} rare. These rare episodes were pivotal 'critical junctures' {{in determining the}} paths taken by modern health systems and in creating a unique health policy arena. A pivotal 'turning point' in Australia {{came in the form}} of <b>national</b> health <b>insurance.</b> Introduced in the early 1970 s, Medibank (universal, <b>compulsory</b> <b>national</b> health <b>insurance)</b> was the first significant structural health policy change in Australia during the twentieth century. When Medibank health insurance proposals were presented in Australia, political struggles erupted. Government leaders in Australia faced fierce opposition from key players within the health policy arena. Prior to this turning point, one of the key health policy players [...] the Australian Medical Association (AMA) [...] had developed a corporate partnership with the non-Labor government. When the Medibank proposal emerged, power structures in the health policy arena were re-aligned. The political role of the AMA shifted from a corporate partner to a pressure group. Examining the political processes surrounding this unique episode of major health policy change helps to illuminate the dual and dynamic nature of the doctors' lobby. Our study aims to demonstrate empirically Day and Klein's proposition that the doctors' lobby operates as a pressure group, rather than as a corporate-style partner, during periods of structural reform in health care [Political Studies, 40 (1992) 462]. This case study of the doctors' lobby during Medibank negotiations represents a rare break in the tradition of ultimate medical professional veto power in health policy decision-making and provides empirical evidence that challenges a widely held perception about an inevitable historical path of medical dominance.

40|$|Background: Disability {{and chronic}} {{conditions}} both {{have an impact}} on health expenditures and although they are conceptually related, they present different dimensions of ill-health. Recent concepts of disability combine a biological understanding of impairment with the social dimension of activity limitation and resulted {{in the development of the}} Global Activity Limitation Indicator (GALI). This paper reports on the predictive value of the GALI on health care expenditures in relation to the presence of chronic conditions. Methods: Data from the Belgian Health Interview Survey 2008 were linked with data from the <b>compulsory</b> <b>national</b> health <b>insurance</b> (n = 7, 286). The effect of activity limitation on health care expenditures was assessed via cost ratios from multivariate linear regression models. To study the factors contributing to the difference in health expenditure between persons with and without activity limitations, the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method was used. Results: Activity limitations are a strong determinant of health care expenditures. People with severe activity limitations (5. 1 %) accounted for 16. 9 % of the total health expenditure, whereas those without activity limitations (79. 0 %), were responsible for 51. 5 % of the total health expenditure. These observed differences in health care expenditures can to some extent be explained by chronic conditions, but activity limitations also contribute substantially to higher health care expenditures in the absence of chronic conditions (cost ratio 2. 46; 95 % CI 1. 74 - 3. 48 for moderate and 4. 45; 95 % CI 2. 47 - 8. 02 for severe activity limitations). The association between activity limitation and health care expenditures is stronger for reimbursed health care costs than for out-of-pocket payments. Conclusion: In the absence of chronic conditions, activity limitations appear to be an important determinant of health care expenditures. To make projections on health care expenditures, routine data on activity limitations are essential and complementary to data on chronic conditions...|$|R
