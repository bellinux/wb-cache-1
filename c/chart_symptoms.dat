40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the differences between patients with overactive bladder (OAB) and detrusor overactivity (DO) and those with OAB but without DO. Methods: We prospectively recruited patients with OAB symptoms between December 2008 and September 2009. All patients were required to complete a 3 -day frequency–volume <b>chart.</b> <b>Symptom</b> severity was evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) questionnaires. All patients also underwent urodynamic studies. Demographics, symptom severity, urinary frequency and volume, and urodynamic variables of patients with and without DO were compared. Results: Of the 133 enrolled patients (76 women and 57 men), DO was diagnosed in 80 patients (60. 2 %). All demographic variables were similar among the OAB patients, regardless of DO status. Total IPSS and OABSS scores did not differ between the OAB and DO groups. However, the nighttime urinary frequency subscore on the OABSS differed significantly between OAB patients with DO and without DO (p =  0. 048). There were no significant differences in terms of urodynamic variables, urinary frequency, or urine volume between OAB patients with and without DO.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{investigate}} whether female patients with predominant voiding symptom really have objective voiding phase dysfunction. MethodsFemale patients with lower urinary tract symptoms who underwent video-urodynamic study between January 2009 and December 2012 were recruited. All patients completed a 3 -day frequency-volume <b>chart.</b> <b>Symptom</b> severity was evaluated using International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) and Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI- 6) questionnaires. The patients with IPSS-voiding subscores greater than IPSS-storage subscores and their most bother symptom {{are one of}} voiding symptom of IPSS were defined as subjective voiding dysfunction group (SVD group). The demographics, IPSS scores, OABSS scores, frequency-volume charts and urodynamic variables were compared between SVD and non-SVD groups. ResultsOf the 842 enrolled patients, 142 (16. 9 %) were classified into SVD group. Total IPSS and IPSS-voiding subscores of SVD group {{were significantly higher than}} those of non-SVD group. Conversely, IPSS-storage subscores, OABSS and UDI- 6 scores of SVD group were significantly lower than those of non-SVD group. The prevalence of urodynamic voiding phase dysfunction was 64. 7 % in SVD group, which was significantly higher than those of non-SVD group (37. 8 %, p <  0. 01). SVD group showed more prevalent bladder outlet obstruction (50. 0 % vs. 27. 0 %, p <  0. 01). There {{were no significant differences in}} the prevalence of impaired detrusor contractility between SVD and non-SVD group. Detrusor overactivity was more prevalent in non-SVD group (5. 6 % vs. 18. 6 %, p <  0. 01). ConclusionsEven though the female patients complain of predominant voiding symptoms, only two thirds of them were identified having urodynamic voiding phase dysfunction. On the other hand, in female patients whose predominant complaint are not voiding symptom, around one third of them were found to have urodynamic voiding phase dysfunction.

Fifteen women who demonstrated negative affect perimenstrual symptoms and seventeen women who were identified as asymptomatic <b>charted</b> their <b>symptoms</b> daily for three menstrual cycles. During this time, state anxiety and blood cortisol levels were measured twice a week. The results of this study support a positive relationship between stressful life events, trait anxiety, state anxiety, and perimenstrual symptoms. However, cortisol levels were not correlated with either perimenstrual symptoms or state anxiety. There was a difference between the symptomatic and the asymptomatic groups in terms of stressful life events and trait anxiety.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the value of}} performing urodynamic investigations {{in the assessment of}} women with a history of pure stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Methods: Consecutive women with lower urinary tract symptoms were studied retrospectively. Urinary symptoms were determined from the frequency-volume <b>chart</b> and <b>symptom</b> section of the King’s Health Questionnaire. Only women with pure SUI symptoms were included. Results: A total of 3428 women aged 24 - 81 years were studied. Only 308 women (8. 9 %) could be classified as having pure SUI from the questionnaire. Of these, 241 of women (78. 2 %) had urodynamic stress inconti-nence, 23 women (7. 5 %) had detrusor overactivity, 9 women (2. 9 %) had mixed urodynamic diagnosis, and 35 women (11. 4 %) had inconclusive urodynamics. Postvoid residual volumes greater than 100 mL were noted in 24 (7. 8 %) women. Conclusions: Our results show that urodynamic investigations provide useful information in the assessment of women with a history of pure SUI, because as many as 20 % of them might not need surgery as the first line of treatment.

40|$|Five {{percent of}} menstruating women have severe {{premenstrual}} symptoms and impairment of functioning defined as {{premenstrual dysphoric disorder}} (PMDD). Clinically significant premenstrual symptoms occur in at least an additional 20 % of menstruating women. The diagnosis of PMDD should be confirmed by prospective <b>symptom</b> <b>charting</b> over 2 menstrual cycles to confirm {{the timing of the}} symptoms and to rule out other diagnoses. The burden of illness of PMDD includes disruption of parenting and partner relationships and decreased productivity in work roles. In addition, women with PMDD have increased use of health care services such as clinician visits and increased use of prescription medications and over-the-counter preparations. The etiology of PMDD is multifactorial. In particular, dysregulation of the serotonin and allopregnanolone systems is implicated. Several effective treatment options exist, including serotonergic antidepressant medications and an oral contraceptive that contains ethinyl estradiol and drosperinone. In addition, other hormones that suppress ovulation, anxiolytics, cognitive therapy, chasteberry and calcium may be helpful...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: There is {{a widely}} held {{perception}} that lower urinary tract symptoms may be exacerbated by cold weather. In this study, we {{examine the effect of}} seasonal variation in ambient temperatures on frequency–volume <b>chart</b> derivatives, <b>symptom</b> severity scores and uroflowmetry parameters in men with lower urinary tract symptom. Methods: Between January 2000 and April 2004, men presenting with lower urinary tract symptom were prospectively recruited and assessed in Edinburgh, UK (55 ° 52 ′N) with maritime temperate climates (Köppen classification Cfb). Local monthly temperatures were extracted from national meteorological records. Patients completed the International Prostate Symptom Score and 3 -day frequency volume chart before undergoing free uroflowmetry with post-micturition volume measurement. Exclusion criteria were previous bladder outflow surgery and anti-cholinergic medication. Results: Data on 296 patients were suitable for analysis. Mean age was 62. 3 years (range, 26 – 90). Over the period of study, the coldest month was January (mean[*]=[*] 4. 7 ℃) and the warmest month was August (mean[*]=[*] 15. 8 ℃). There was no significant variation in either International Prostate Symptom Score symptom scores by season (p[*]&# 62;[*] 0. 05) or any frequency–volume chart parameters, with the exception on an increase in median actual nightly voids over the summer months (p[*]=[*] 0. 021). There was no significant correlation between maximal flow rate and post-micturition residual volumes and mean monthly temperatures (p[*]&# 62;[*] 0. 05). Conclusions: Seasonal variation in nocturia, but not other frequency–volume parameters, symptom severity or uroflowmetry parameters, is significant in men with lower urinary tract symptom. Future work should consider the impact of seasonal variation in lower urinary tract symptoms in both sexes across a wider range of climates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:Background: Premenstrual {{syndrome}} (PMS) is a {{group of}} physical and psychological symptoms experienced by some females of reproductive age during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle (Day 14 to Day 1 of the next menstruation cycle). PMS is characterised by breast tenderness, abdominal bloating, headaches, food cravings and swelling of the extremities, irritability, depression, anxiety, social withdrawal and memory changes. These symptoms may interfere with females’ daily activities, increase absenteeism from work and affect relationships. The aetiology appears to be multifactorial, including behaviour, diet, genetics, physical activity and excessive alcohol consumption. Conventional pharmacological drugs used to treat/alleviate symptoms may have side-effects and may interact negatively with other medications. Given the difficulty of finding the right homoeopathic remedy for a given individual and condition, this study proposes using the Grant Bentley Method (GBM) of Homoeopathic Facial Analysis (HFA) to choose remedies for women suffering from PMS. The GBM relies on homoeopathic case-taking, photographs of facial features and repertorisation to determine a person’s dominant miasmatic group to help select specific homoeopathic remedies. Prior research indicates that using individualised homoeopathic treatment in PMS is effective, but no prior studies have considered homoeopathic treatment using the GBM of HFA on women with PMS. Aim: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of individualised homoeopathic treatment, using the GBM of HFA on females experiencing PMS by means of case studies and a daily self-grading PMS <b>symptom</b> grading <b>chart.</b> Methodology: A 12 -week case study was done on ten females (aged 18 to 40 years) who met the study’s inclusion and exclusion criteria. Volunteers recruited via posters on the Doornfontein Campus of the University of Johannesburg, South Africa, were screened for inclusion. Participation information was explained, and volunteers signed a consent form and a medical photograph consent form. Participants’ individual homoeopathic case histories were recorded, and nine photographs (not published) were taken of each participant’s facial features from different angles to determine their dominant miasmatic group according to the GBM. During the first consultation (and if necessary in a follow-up consultation), appropriate physical examinations were done. Findings were recorded. Participants were given a monthly self-grading PMS <b>symptom</b> <b>chart</b> to grade <b>symptoms</b> daily throughout the study. During the first month, there was no treatment, in order to establish a baseline of symptoms. At follow [...] ...|$|R

This study aimed to explore help-seeking and antibiotic prescribing for acute cough in Chinese primary care population. This is a prospective multicentre observational study that included adults presenting with acute cough. Clinicians recorded patients' presenting symptoms, examination findings and medication prescription. Patients completed symptom diaries for up to 28 days by <b>charting</b> their <b>symptom</b> severity and recovery. Adjusted binary logistic regression models identified factors independently associated with antibiotic prescription. Primary care clinicians (n= 19) recruited 455 patients. A total of 321 patients (70. 5 %) returned their completed symptom diaries. Concern about illness severity (41. 6 %) and obtaining a prescription for symptomatic medications (45. 9 %), rather than obtaining a prescription for antibiotics, were {{the main reasons for}} consulting. Antibiotics were prescribed for 6. 8 % (n= 31) of patients, of which amoxicillin was the most common antimicrobial prescribed (61. 3 %), as it was associated with clinicians' perception of benefit from antibiotic treatment (odds ratio (OR) : 25. 9, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 6. 7 - 101. 1), patients' expectation for antibiotics (OR: 5. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 7 - 11. 6), anticipation (OR: 5. 1, 95 % CI: 1. 6 - 15. 0) and request for antibiotics (OR 15. 7, 95 % CI: 5. 0 - 49. 4), as well as the severity of respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, short of breath and wheeze OR: 2. 7 - 3. 7, all P< 0. 05). There was a significant difference in antibiotic prescription rates between private primary care clinicians and public primary care clinicians (17. 4 vs 1. 6 %, P= 0. 00). Symptomatic medication was prescribed in 98. 0 % of patients. Mean recovery was 9 days for cough and 10 days for all symptoms, which was not significantly associated with antibiotic treatment.

Design: Anonymous questionnaire survey of patients regarding violence and a <b>chart</b> review regarding <b>symptoms</b> and diagnoses. Setting: Community-based family practice residency training center in a midwestern city. Participants: Women 18 {{years of age}} or older visiting the center over a 2 -month period in 1990. Of 476 eligible participants, 394 (82. 7 %) consented to complete the survey. Measures: A detailed, standardized measure of violence was used. Physical and psychological problems were given codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD- 9). Results: Younger women and those separated or divorced from their partners {{were more likely to have}} been victims. Never-married women also had substantially high rates of victimization. Depression was the strongest indicator of victimization, even when controlling for demographic factors. Back pain, ulcers, headaches, and anxiety were not strong indicators of abuse. A classification analysis showed that a combination of all variables could predict lifetime injury only about half the time and violence in the past year only about 20 % of the time. Conclusions: Since neither demographic nor health factors could accurately predict who had been victimized, all women need to be asked about abuse.

40|$|Background: Transient lower {{oesophageal}} sphincter relaxation (TLOSR) is {{the predominant}} mechanism of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) in healthy infants but {{the mechanisms of}} GOR in infants with GOR disease (GORD) are poorly understood. Aims: To measure the occurrence of TLOSR, GOR, and gastric emptying (GE) rate in preterm and term infants with GORD. Patients: Thirty six infants were studied and grouped as normals or GORD based on a routine clinical assessment and confirmation of an assessment of GORD by reflux <b>symptom</b> <b>charts</b> and oesophageal pH monitoring. Methods: A micromanometric assembly incorporating a micro pH electrode recorded oesophageal motility and pH. GE rate was determined using the C- 13 -octanoic acid breath test. Results: TLOSR was the predominant mechanism of GOR, triggering 50 - 100 % of GOR episodes (median 91. 5 %). Abdominothoracic straining significantly increased the occurrence of GOR in association with TLOSR. In infants with GORD, the number of TLOSRs overall was similar to normals but the proportion of TLOSRs accompanied by acid GOR {{was significantly higher than}} in normals (16. 5 % v 5. 7 %, respectively; p < 0. 001). Infants with GORD had a similar GE rate to normals.

It remains undecided whether {{this lack of}} distinct personality profiles {{is partly due to}} comorbidity among disorders or contamination by current state. Using data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, we investigated 1046 participants with panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and/or major depressive disorder (MDD) and 474 healthy controls. Personality traits at baseline and two-year follow-up were assessed with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview was used to determine the presence of emotional disorders at baseline and at two-year follow-up; the Life <b>Chart</b> Interview determined <b>symptom</b> severity in the month prior to baseline and during follow-up. By analysing pure cases and investigating the effects in remitted cases, PD participants were found to be higher in N, but not lower in E and C than controls.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} utility of a less {{invasive}} approach {{to the care of}} women with a pelvic abscess, we retrospectively reviewed the outcome of women with pelvic abscesses managed by transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 27 pelvic abscesses in 22 consecutive women undergoing transvaginal drainage, including 13 tuboovarian abscesses (TOAs) and 14 postoperative abscesses (POAs). All patients received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics from the time infection was diagnosed to resolution of signs and <b>symptoms.</b> <b>Chart</b> review and examination of ultrasound files were utilized to extract demographic clinical, laboratory, and outcome data. Results: The mean age for the study group was 30 years old. Mean duration from diagnosis to drainage was 5. 6 days (TOA) and 2. 0 days (POA), P < 0. 01. The mean diameter of the abscesses was 86 mm. The volume of purulent material drained ranged from 70 - 750 mL. Perceived adequacy of drainage was correlated with lack of abscess septation. Cultures for aerobic and anaerobic pathogens were positive in 51 % of cases (79 % POA versus 23 % TOA, P < 0. 05) with 1. 9 organisms/ positive culture. Transvaginal drainage was successful in 25 of 27 abscesses. No complications were reported.

40|$|PURPOSE: Nocturia has a {{major impact}} on quality of life and affects {{numerous}} aspects of health. Lifestyle modifications are expected to be helpful in improving nocturia. However, the efficacy of this strategy has not been established. We tested the efficacy of nondrug lifestyle measures as a first step in treating nocturia and found factors predictive of the efficacy of the intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective evaluation of 56 patients treated at 3 hospitals between 2005 and 2009 for symptomatic nocturia. The patients were advised to modify their lifestyle to improve nocturia. Lifestyle modifications consisted of 4 directives of 1) restriction of fluid intake, 2) refraining from excess hours in bed, 3) moderate daily exercise and 4) keeping warm in bed. The frequency volume <b>chart,</b> International Prostate <b>Symptom</b> Score, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index before and 4 weeks after the intervention were used to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy. RESULTS: Mean nocturnal voids and nocturnal urine volume decreased significantly from 3. 6 to 2. 7 (p < 0. 0001) and from 923 to 768 ml (p = 0. 0005), respectively. Of the 56 patients 26 (53. 1 %) showed an improvement of more than 1 episode. This treatment was significantly more effective in patients with a larger 24 -hour urine production. CONCLUSIONS: Nondrug lifestyle measures were effective in decreasing the number of nocturia episodes and improving patient quality of life. Patients with polyuria showed a better response to the treatment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionAntibody {{production}} defects may predispose {{children to}} inflammatory pathologies {{and therefore we}} hypothesized that this group of immune deficiencies {{may be associated with}} food allergy. Objective of the studyTo better characterize the interrelated pathomechanisms of food allergy coexisting with hypogammaglobulinemia in children and to define the relationship between clinical manifestation of antibody production defects and food allergy. Material and methodsTwenty-three children aged from 8 to 88 months regularly followed-up in the pediatric pneumonology, allergology and immunology clinic due to hypogammaglobulinemia concerning one or more major immunoglobulin isotypes were retrospectively reviewed in terms of incidence and manifestation of concomitant food allergy. Information regarding the patient's history of allergic diseases and laboratory data concerning serum levels of immunoglobulins, including total IgE, were obtained from <b>chart</b> review. ResultsClinical <b>symptoms</b> of food allergy were identified in 17 of 23 (74 %) children studied. The mean age of onset of clinical symptoms was 2. 7 months. Eczema was the most frequent manifestation present in 16 children, diarrheas and abdominal cramps were noted equally in 3 children, gastroesophageal reflux disease was diagnosed in 2 children as well as vomiting was observed in 2 children. Atopy was revealed in 8 of 17 children (47 %) with food allergy. ConclusionsFood allergy is a common health problem coexisting with antibody production defects in infants and young children. Clinical symptoms correlate better with low immunoglobulin levels than with serum IgE, that is not a suitable diagnostic criterion for allergic disease in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia...|$|R

Objective To {{characterize}} the pharmacodynamics and systemic exposure of esomeprazole in 26 preterm infants and term neonates with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux and pathologic acid exposure. Study design Enrolled patients received oral esomeprazole 0. 5 mg/kg once daily for 7 days. Twenty-four–hour esophagogastric pH-impedance monitoring was performed at baseline and on day 7. Pharmacokinetic {{analysis was performed}} on day 7. Symptoms occurring during the baseline and day 7 studies were recorded on a <b>symptom</b> <b>chart.</b> Results There {{were no significant differences}} from baseline to day 7 of therapy in the frequency of bolus reflux, consistency of bolus reflux (liquid, mixed, or gas), extent of bolus reflux, or bolus clearance time. Acid bolus reflux episodes were reduced on therapy (median 30 vs 8, P <. 001), as was the reflux index (mean % time esophageal pH < 4, 15. 7 % vs 7. 1 %, P <. 001). The estimated geometric mean of area under the plasma concentration time curve during the dosing interval and observed maximum plasma concentration was 2. 5 μmol · h/L and 0. 74 μmol/L, respectively. The number of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms recorded over 24 hours was lower on therapy (median 22 vs 12, P <. 05). Conclusions In preterm infants and term neonates esomeprazole produces no change in bolus reflux characteristics despite significant acid suppression.

40|$|Introduction: Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) are {{a common}} reason for Emergency Department (ED) visits.   The objective {{of this study was}} to see if there were gender differences in CDC diagnosis and treatment guidelines as documented by emergency physicians. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed to idenitfy patients treate for urethritis, cervicitis, and PID in the EDs of three hospitals in a PA network during a calendar year.   Cases were reviewed to assess for compliance in documentation with CDC guidelines. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the distributions of study variables by patient sex.   Student t-tess, chi-square tests, and logistic regression were used in the analysis.   Statistical significance was set at p less than or equal to 0. 05. Results: 286 patient records were identified, of these 39 were excluded due to incorrect disease coding, the patient was admitted and treated as an inpatient for their disease, or the patient left the emergency department after refusing care.   Of the 247 participangs, 159   (64. 4 %) were female.   Females were significantly younger (26. 6 years, SD= 8. 0) than males (31. 2, SD= 11. 5 %), (95 %CI: 2. 0 - 7. 0, p= 0. 0003). All of the males (n= 88) in the cohort presented with urethritis; 25. 8 % of females presented with cervicitis and 75. 2 % with PID.  Compliance with documentation for the 5 CDC criteria ranged from 68. 8 % for patient history to 93. 5 % for patient diagnostic testing including urine pregnancy, and gonorrhea/chlamydia cultures. Significant differences were obesrved by patient sex.   54 % of the <b>charts</b> had <b>symptoms</b> recorded for female patients that were consistent with CDC characteristics for diagnostic critera compared to over 95 % for males, (OR= 16. 9, 95 % CI 5. 9 - 48. 4, p less than 0. 001). Similar results were observed for patient discharge instructions, with physicians completely documenting deliver of discharge instructions to 51. 6 % females compared to 97. 7 % of complet documentation in males OR= 42. 3; 95 %CI; 10. 0 - 178. 6, p < 0. 001). No significant sex differences in documentaion were observed for exam or fo therapeutic antibiotic treatment. Conclusion: This retrospective study found patient gender differences in documentaiton compliance with CDC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of urethritis, cervicitis and PID...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Strict {{glycaemic}} {{control in}} {{type 2 diabetic}} patients is recommended {{in a number of}} treatment protocols. However, although better glycaemic control prevents or postpones chronic diabetic complications, it remains uncertain how this affects quality of life in the short and long term. AIM: To study the impact of insulin therapy on glycaemic control and quality of life in type 2 diabetic patients, with secondary failure on maximal oral medication. DESIGN OF STUDY: Two separate sets of analyses were performed: a longitudinal analysis of those patients converted to insulin therapy and a comparison of 12 -week outcomes between the two randomisation groups. SETTING: Ten general practices, participating in the Nijmegen Monitoring Project. METHOD: Patients, poorly controlled on maximal oral therapy, were stratified with respect to age and sex, and randomly allocated to insulin therapy in two different schedules: (a) after a 12 -week period with enhanced compliance to diet and oral therapy: or (b) as soon as secondary failure was established. Patients were referred to a diabetologist to start insulin therapy and were referred back to their general practitioner (GP) as soon as glycaemic control was stable. We assessed fasting blood glucose, HbA 1 c functional health, and quality of life (Sickness Impact Profile, COOP/WONCA <b>charts,</b> Diabetes <b>Symptom</b> Checklist) at baseline, after the patient was referred back to the GP, and nine months later. RESULTS: Of the 38 included patients, three patients dropped out and seven patients were not switched over to insulin therapy. In patients starting insulin therapy, mean HbA 1 c and fasting blood glucose level decreased from 9. 5 % to 7. 6 %, and from 12. 0 mmol to 8. 4 mmol, respectively (P < 0. 001). The better control was accompanied by a decrease in hyperglycaemic complaints (P = 0. 01). No increase in hypoglycaemic complaints was found. There were no statistically significant changes in quality-of-life parameters. After 12 weeks, patients directly referred to insulin therapy showed a statistically significant improvement in HbA 1 c and fasting glucose level, in contrast to patients with enhanced compliance. Quality-of-life scores did not significantly differ statistically. CONCLUSION: Insulin therapy in poorly controlled type 2 diabetic patients from general practice resulted in a significant clinical improvement of glycaemic control, accompanied by a reduction of hyperglycaemic complaints, without an increase in hypoglycaemic complaints or an adverse influence on quality of life...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (EETS) is {{increasingly}} applied to treat tuberculum sellae meningiomas. However, if the tumor adheres firmly to the optic nerve, dissection of {{the interface between}} both structures should be prudent to preserve visual function. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether tumor adhesion to the optic nerve can be predicted preoperatively by fast imaging with steady-state acquisition (FIESTA). Methods Twenty-two patients with tuberculum sellae meningioma treated with EETS were retrospectively identified. Clinical characteristics, radiologic studies, intraoperative findings, and outcomes were reviewed from their clinical <b>charts.</b> Results Patients' <b>symptoms</b> included visual function impairment in 18 patients and headaches in 4 patients. Symptoms were resolved in 19 patients after operation. Preoperative radiologic evaluation was performed in 44  sides (22 patients) of the interface between tumors and the optic nerves and showed absence of peritumoral hyperintensity on FIESTA in 7 sides in 7 patients. In 5 of the 7 sides, tumor dissection was complicated by firm adhesion to the optic nerves. Among these cases, visual functions were unchanged in 1 patient after complete removal of the adhesion but substantially improved in 3 patients after partial resection. In the remaining 37 sides with preoperative peritumoral hyperintensity, no adhesion was found between both structures intraoperatively. Conclusions Absence of peritumoral hyperintensity between tuberculum sellae meningioma and the optic nerve on FIESTA may indicate firm adhesion at the interface, severely complicating complete removal. Preoperative recognition of this adhesion is important for safe tumor removal and preservation of visual functions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2002 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd & British Society of Gastroenterology. BACKGROUND: Transient lower {{oesophageal}} sphincter relaxation (TLOSR) is {{the predominant}} mechanism of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) in healthy infants but {{the mechanisms of}} GOR in infants with GOR disease (GORD) are poorly understood. AIMS: To measure the occurrence of TLOSR, GOR, and gastric emptying (GE) rate in preterm and term infants with GORD. PATIENTS: Thirty six infants were studied and grouped as normals or GORD based on a routine clinical assessment and confirmation of an assessment of GORD by reflux <b>symptom</b> <b>charts</b> and oesophageal pH monitoring. METHODS: A micromanometric assembly incorporating a micro pH electrode recorded oesophageal motility and pH. GE rate was determined using the (13) C-octanoic acid breath test. RESULTS: TLOSR was the predominant mechanism of GOR, triggering 50 - 100 % of GOR episodes (median 91. 5 %). Abdominothoracic straining significantly increased the occurrence of GOR in association with TLOSR. In infants with GORD, the number of TLOSRs overall was similar to normals but the proportion of TLOSRs accompanied by acid GOR {{was significantly higher than}} in normals (16. 5 % v 5. 7 %, respectively; p< 0. 001). Infants with GORD had a similar GE rate to normals. CONCLUSIONS: In infant GORD, acid reflux associated TLOSRs are abnormally common and likely to be a major contributing factor to the pathophysiology of GORD. Infants with GORD do not have delayed GE.
