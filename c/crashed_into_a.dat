Also in Albemarle, two people were killed when their car drove off a road and <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tree during heavy rainfall. A man in Chesterfield County died when struck by a tree. Three people died when a car in southern Fluvanna County <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tree. The deaths were considered indirectly related to the storm.|$|E

5|$|Moments {{after the}} two planes collided, the only mayday {{distress}} call radioed by the United Airlines crew was heard at 8:30a.m. plus 20 seconds. The crippled airlinernow missing about eight feet (2.5 m) of its right wingtrailed black smoke and flames as it spiraled earthward, and <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> then-empty patch of desert outside the town of Arden {{in what is now}} the unincorporated town of Enterprise.

5|$|Since {{the first}} World Championship Grand Prix in 1950, red flags {{have been shown}} in seventy races, with the latest one being at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix on 25 June 2017. Twenty-six were {{restarted}} on the first lap. Thirteen races were not restarted, nine because of rain and four due to accidents involving drivers. Five races were stopped due to incidents that resulted in fatalities: The 1975 Spanish Grand Prix was stopped on lap twenty-nine and not restarted after Rolf Stommelen's car <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> spectator area, killing five people. The 1978 Italian Grand Prix was red-flagged after a massive crash that ultimately contributed {{to the death of}} Ronnie Peterson. The 1982 Canadian Grand Prix was halted on the first lap after Riccardo Paletti was killed when his car collided with the back of Didier Pironi's Ferrari. The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was red-flagged on lap five following the fatal accident of Ayrton Senna, in which his car <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> wall at the Tamburello curve. The 2014 Japanese Grand Prix was red-flagged for a second time following a serious collision between Jules Bianchi and a recovery vehicle which would ultimately prove to be fatal.|$|E

5|$|Barry dropped {{moderate}} to heavy rainfall across Florida, peaking at 6.99inches (178mm) at Palm Beach International Airport; several other locations reported over 3inches (75mm). The rainfall alleviated persistent drought conditions and assisted in combating severe wildfires across the state. In Brevard County, the rainfall closed {{a portion of}} Eau Gallie Boulevard after a large sinkhole developed. Several other roads across the area were flooded, and on Interstate 95 near Lake Worth, a sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic. Wet roads caused several traffic accidents across the state; in both Brevard and Volusia counties, a motorist was killed from an accident. On Interstate 4, a tractor trailer led to disruptions near Orlando after it <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> guardrail.|$|E
5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907. The flight had {{lasted only a}} few seconds when the glider <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> wall, with Capper {{sustaining}} a cut to the head. The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1. This was an ironic achievement for Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved {{no more than a few}} hops.|$|E
5|$|On July10, 2008, {{a tanker}} truck {{full of water}} <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tree along a portion of NY149 between Bay Road (CR7) and Ridge Road (NY9L) that {{features}} a sharp curve. After the first accident occurred at 3:10 a.m., a second tractor-trailer, who had stopped because of the tanker, rolled in reverse, jackknifing across the road and hitting a car. The road was shut down for the accident, where {{the driver of the}} tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers of the car and the tractor-trailer that jackknifed were not hurt. The route was reopened by 11:40 a.m. This accident was one of many tractor-trailer accidents that has occurred on this stretch of NY149.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the storm}} {{weakened}} considerably from its peak intensity, damage {{was much less}} than initially anticipated. In all, damages from the storm amounted to 15billion (2001 JPY, $140million USD). Three people {{were killed by the}} storm, all of whom were found in irrigation ditches. The first fatality was an 81-year-old man, the second was a 30-year-old man who lost control of his car and <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> ditch, and the last fatality was a 3-year-old boy who fell in a ditch near his home. Two 11-year-old boys, initially reported as missing, were later found in a ditch after being swept away by flood waters.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan (Republic of China) {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with the U.S. to purchase 30 AH-64Es with weapons, and associated equipment in June 2011. On 5 November 2013, Taiwan received the first 6 AH-64s. On 25 April 2014, a Taiwanese AH-64E <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> three-story building during a training flight in bad weather conditions, the first airframe loss of an AH-64E. An investigation ruled out mechanical failure and concluded human error as responsible, that the pilots descended too fast through clouds at low altitude without checking flight panels to maintain adequate height; the Army responded by stepping up simulator training for pilots. In October 2014, the fifth and final batch of AH-64Es was delivered to Taiwan, completing the order.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} <b>crashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{remote area}} of marshland on Jamaica Bay {{used as a}} wildlife sanctuary.

The three-alarm fire was under control by 10:50 AM EST, by which point only wreckage remained. Low tides aided search personnel in their attempts to recover bodies from the downed aircraft. Only a few bodies remained intact.|$|E
