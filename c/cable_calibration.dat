30|$|Our work {{shows that}} correct cable delay {{readings}} are of importance and large RMS {{of the cable}} delay data can lead to offsets for the UT 1 -UTC results. Otherwise, neglecting <b>cable</b> <b>calibration</b> data seems to have almost {{no effect on the}} results when using the particular two stations investigated in this study. However, from a more general point of view, electrical path length changes at other sites that might be involved in the future in INT sessions might show characteristics that require such external data in order to process the observations in an unbiased way.|$|E
30|$|Because {{the aim of}} {{our work}} is to analyse INT {{sessions}} automatically and in near real-time, outliers in the station log-files can cause various problems. The automation requirement {{makes it difficult to}} detect any suspicious readings in the station log-files. Furthermore, due to software or hardware errors, station log-files may contain lines of non-standard output, which can cause further problems in the automated analysis. Thus, for the standard non-automated IVS processing, the station log-files are usually screened manually (Gipson 2015, personal communication) or processed with a semi-automatic program (Thorandt 2015, personal communication) so that suspicious or wrong <b>cable</b> <b>calibration</b> data do not propagate in the analysis.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{technical}} {{details of a}} broadband microwave spectrometer for mea-suring the complex conductance of thin films covering the range from 50 MHz up to 16 GHz in the temperature range 300 mK to 6 K and at applied magnetic fields up to 8 Tesla. We measure the complex reflection from a sample terminating a coaxial transmission line and calibrate the signals with three standards with known reflection coefficients. Thermal isolation of the heat load from the inner conductor is accomplished by including a section of NbTi superconducting cable (transition temperature around 8 − 9 K) and hermetic seal glass bead adapters. This enables us to stabilize the base temperature of the sample stage at 300 mK. However, the inclusion of this superconducting <b>cable</b> complicates the <b>calibration</b> procedure. We document {{the effects of the}} superconducting <b>cable</b> on our <b>calibration</b> procedure and the effects of applied magnetic fields and how we control the temperature with great repeatability for each measurement. We have successfully extracted reliable data in this frequency, temperature and field range for thin superconducting films and highly resistive graphene samples. PACS numbers: 07. 57. Pt, 78. 70.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Generally, {{standard}} lysimeters {{include a}} lever-load cell scale, {{which has become}} expensive compared to new electronic equipment available for experimental purposes. Currently, lysimeters containing weighing bars with up to 4 load cells are economically feasible. This goal {{of this study was}} to present the construction and calibration of four weighing lysimeters built using two rectangular tanks, with a surface area of 1. 35 m 2 (1 m by 1. 35 m) and a depth of 1. 5 m, loaded on two weighing bars. Each bar had two high accuracy loading cells connected to a junction box and a datalogger by a coaxial <b>cable.</b> <b>Calibration</b> of each lysimeter was performed after field installation. The results showed a linear response (R 2 > 0. 9999) of electric signal (mV) to mass increase or decrease (kg) with minimum hysteresis. The mean absolute error of the mass estimate (0. 0245 to 0. 2844 equivalent-mm) and a Willmott index between the observed and estimated data (d = 1. 0000) indicate the high precision of the new equipment. The results allow concluding that the lysimeters in this study are appropriate for estimating evapotranspiration and other components of soil water balance...|$|E

40|$|MKE {{heating power}} is {{calculated}} for various bunch lengths. 1 Bunch length The bunch length {{can be measured}} both in time domain and in frequency do-main. In the measurement, the calibration of the response function such as <b>cable</b> attenuation <b>calibration</b> is important. From the SPS bunch spectrum data in May 2002, and cable attenuation data, an rms bunch length of 0. 56 nsec is obtained by assuming a Gaussian distribution (see Fig. 1). In 2003, the bunch length became longer (0. 7 - 0. 75 nsec) because the RF volt-age was 2 MV (5 MV in May 2002) [1]. Anyway it may be preferable to measure the RMS bunch length in time do-main and in frequency domain simultaneously, and check each other. 2 Longitudinal impedance Measured data on the longitudinal coupling impedance by the single coaxial wire method were taken from [3], as shown in Fig. 2. There is also an analytical for-mula for the broad-band impedance [4]. These impedances are used for the heat-ing power estimation. The real part of the longitudinal impedance up to 400 MHz is explicitly shown in Table 1...|$|R
40|$|The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has {{collected}} {{hundreds of hours}} of Epoch of Reionization (EoR) data and now faces the challenge of overcoming foreground and systematic contamination to reduce the data to a cosmological measurement. We introduce several novel analysis techniques such as <b>cable</b> reflection <b>calibration,</b> hyper-resolution gridding kernels, diffuse foreground model subtraction, and quality control methods. Each change to the analysis pipeline is tested against a two dimensional power spectrum figure of merit to demonstrate improvement. We incorporate the new techniques into a deep integration of 32 hours of MWA data. This data set is used to place a systematic-limited upper limit on the cosmological power spectrum of Δ^ 2 ≤ 2. 7 × 10 ^ 4 mK^ 2 at k= 0. 27 h Mpc^- 1 and z= 7. 1, consistent with other published limits, and a modest improvement (factor of 1. 4) over previous MWA results. From this deep analysis we have identified a list of improvements to be made to our EoR data analysis strategies. These improvements will be implemented in the future and detailed in upcoming publications. Comment: 21 pages, 16 figures, accepted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} sensor {{validation}} through experimentation with the Omnisens Distributed Temperature and Strain (DITEST) Brillouin Optical Time Domain Analyzer (BOTDA) {{proved to be}} a challenging project. The project encompassed sensor calibrations, system error minimization, sensor network design and deployment, and the characterization of temperatures in the Orphan Boy Mine shaft. Fiber-optic <b>cable</b> sensor <b>calibrations</b> yielded linear relationship coefficients 0. 6 - 1. 0 MHZ/°F, indicating a strong positive correlation between Brillouin Frequency Shifts and temperature. Calibrated sensors demonstrated accuracies near ± 0. 8 °F using the corrected error bounds from residual analyses as the benchmark. Fiber-optic measurement accuracy and repeatability were controlled by user-selected signal interrogator settings and design limitations within the system. Temperatures monitored during the February-July 2016 period showed little variation except when the Geothermal Heat Exchange System was in operation. A test of the geothermal system (used to heat the Natural Resources Building on the Montana Tech campus) was documented by the fiber-optic sensor cluster deployed in this project and separately by a temperature transducer from the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology. Temperature was an auxiliary sensing function of the DITEST; temperature profiles recorded in time and depth demonstrated the capability of the Brillouin-based signal interrogator when used primarily as a temperature sensing system...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} for fusing optical and laserscanner data is {{presented}} for improved UAV-borne 3 D mapping. We propose to equip an {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) with a small platform which includes two sensors: a standard low-cost digital camera and a lightweight Hokuyo UTM- 30 LX-EW laserscanning device (210 g without <b>cable).</b> Initially, a <b>calibration</b> is carried out for the utilized devices. This involves a geometric camera calibration and the estimation of the position and orientation offset between the two sensors by lever-arm and bore-sight calibration.

These 2 D results are fused with the measured laser distances and fed into a bundle adjustment in order to obtain a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).

40|$|Although {{optimization}} {{methods are}} useful in the preliminary design of cable-stayed bridges for sizing of components and getting optimal bridge configurations, further fine-tuning is invariably conducted in the detailed design thus affecting various sensitive properties such as the deck profile and cable forces. The zero-displacement method that adjusts the initial cable lengths repeatedly to achieve the design deck profile is both computationally intensive and prone to convergence difficulty. Therefore a calibration method is proposed based on a Kriging surrogate model built using the uniform design approach. Apart from establishing {{the relationship between the}} bridge deck geometry and the initial cable forces by statistical method, the Kriging model also obviates the need for a large number of repeated finite element analyses. A simple cable-stayed bridge is used to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. In real-life cable-stayed bridges with many <b>cables,</b> a staged <b>calibration</b> is implemented so that the Kriging model is used to identify reasonable initial forces in the critical stay cables so that the zero-displacement method or similar can be used for further adjustments. Verification shows that this staged calibration can address not only the deck level tolerance but also the control of cable forces...|$|R

40|$|Derivation of an {{electromagnetic}} model, {{regarding the}} wave propagation {{in a very}} long (10 km or more) High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) power cable, is the central part of this thesis. With an existing “perfect” electromagnetic model there are potentially a wide range of applications. The electromagnetic model is focused on frequencies between 0 and 100 kHz since higher frequencies essentially will be attenuated. An exact dispersion relation is formulated and the propagation constant is computed numerically. The dominating mode is the first Transversal Magnetic (TM) mode of order zero, denoted TM 01, which is also referred to as the quasi-TEM mode. A comparison is made with the second propagating TM mode of order zero denoted TM 02. The electromagnetic model is verified against real time data from Time Domain Reflection (TDR) measurements on a HVDC power <b>cable.</b> A mismatch <b>calibration</b> procedure is performed due to matching difficulties between the TDR measurement equipment and the power cable regarding the single-mode transmission line model. An example of power cable length measurements is addressed, which reveals that with a “perfect” model the length of an 80 km long power cable could be estimated to an accuracy of a few centimeters. With the present model the accuracy can be estimated to approximately 100 m. In order to understand the low-frequency wave propagation characteristics, an exact asymptotic analysis is performed. It is shown that the behavior of the propagation constant is governed by a square root of the complex frequency in the lowfrequency domain. This thesis also focuses on an analysis regarding the sensitivity of the propagation constant with respect to some of the electric parameters in the model. Variables of interest when performing the parameter sensitivity study are the real relative permittivityand the conductivity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Norwegian Public Roads Administration {{focus on}} issues to improve weight controls, {{and the quality}} of {{statistic}} weigh data. An important part of the project is field tests of different methods and equipment for collecting Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) data, with high speed WIM equipment, and V 2 I communication where the vehicle reports its own weight. The tests are focusing on data quality (WIM vs static weight), user interface and usability, procedure and need for calibration and lifetime of sensors. Another important part of the project is the use of WIM data to pre-select vehicles at the control station. WIM data are combined with license plate numbers from ANPR cameras, and the measured weight is compared with the permitted weight. If a vehicle is overloaded then a warning is shown on the control station. This allows legal drivers to pass without being stopped. We have conducted several tests over a three years period. Two different WIM sensors technologies from four different manufacturers has been tested. The focus of the tests have been on accuracy, lifetime of sensors, calibration and usability of software and equipment. We have tested equipment for high speed WIM for pre selection of vehicles at control stations. Our results shows that lineas quarts sensors are better than piezo electric <b>cables.</b> The <b>calibration</b> procedures are time end cost consuming. Lifetime of the sensors are very short. This can be improved by deeper installation where it is possible. It is a problem that the accuracy of the sensors decrease over time. For one system the error in average gross weight increased to about 15 % over a period of 6 months. The error in the other system had increased to 15 % in three months, and after calibration the error increased to 15 % in just over one month. A full scale test of a V 2 I system was conducted in Oslo in February 2015, as a proof of concept. One instrumented vehicle was used to verify the communication protocols. The information flow was steady and the focus was therefore on the reported weight. The internal difference in the self-declared truck weight for each axel was very low – with less than 1 % difference between the test runs. Compared with the static weight the self-declared truck weight was approximately 5 % too low. This was considered as a good start for the concept. A full scale tests with four vehicles are planned to start in September. The trucks will be equipped with communication units for sharing the current weight for a two month period. This setup will provide us with a wider basis for evaluating the data quality provided by the system. We believe that in the future WIM systems will be used together with V 2 I solutions, and that this will improve vehicle weight control further. The project is a cooperation between the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the Traffic Engineering Research Centre...|$|R
40|$|Fully grouted cable bolts {{have been}} used in the mining {{industry}} for more than fifty years. However, failure of cable bolting systems still occurs in mine sites, as a result of insufficient load transfer between the rock mass and the cable bolt. Numerous research studies have been conducted to understand the load transfer mechanism of cable bolts in the laboratory. However, there are many shortcomings in previous methods. This thesis aims to propose a new approach to study the load transfer mechanism of cable bolts. As part of this research, a modified Laboratory Short Encapsulation Pull Test (LSEPT) facility was developed. It was mainly composed of two parts, namely the embedment section and the anchor section. The influence of termination methods, borehole roughness and pre-confinement on the performance of cable bolts was investigated. The results show that the pre-confinement has a significant effect on the performance of cable bolts. The load transfer behaviour of two types of cable bolts, the Superstrand cable and the MW 9 cable, was studied. The influence of different parameters including the cable surface geometry, borehole size and confining medium strength was evaluated. The results show that bond failure of Superstrand cable bolting systems always occurred at the cable/grout interface. However, for the MW 9 cable installed in a standard borehole, bond failure occurred at the grout/rock interface in the weak confining medium. An analytical model was used to study the load transfer behaviour of cable bolts. Experimental results were adopted to validate this model. It was found that the cable/grout interface undergoes different stages in a pull-out test and the non-uniform shear stress distribution is more apparent in long embedment length. The shear performance of the Stratabinder grout in the constant normal stress and constant normal stiffness conditions was also studied. The results reveal that the low normal stiffness has little impact on the performance of the grout. FLAC 2 D software package was used to simulate the axial behaviour of <b>cable</b> bolts. The <b>calibration</b> process of samples and the pull-out performance of cable bolts were validated with experimental results. It was found that the modified surface geometry has an obvious influence on inducing more confining pressure in pull-out tests...|$|R
