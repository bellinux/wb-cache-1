40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the effects of impregnation chemicals on the combustion properties of 3 -ply laminated veneer lumber (LVL) made of Oak (Quercus petraea subsp. İberica) and Poplar (Populus tremula L.). For this purpose, oak wood was used as the outer ply and poplar used for the <b>core</b> <b>ply</b> in LVL. Borax (BX), boric acid (BA), borax+boric acid (BX+BA), and di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) were used as impregnation chemicals, and urea formaldehyde (UF), phenol formaldehyde (PF), and melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) adhesives as bonding agent were used to produce LVLs. The vacuum – pressure method was used for the impregnation process. The combustion test was performed according to the procedure defined in the ASTM–E 69 standards, and during the test the mass reduction, temperature, and released gas (CO, O 2) were determined for each 30 seconds. As a result, di-ammonium phosphate was found to be the most successful fire retardant chemical in LVL with MUF adhesive. LVL produced from a combination of oak and poplar veneers with MUF adhesive and impregnated with DAP can be recommended {{to be used as a}} fire resistant building material where required...|$|E

40|$|Genetic Algorithm and {{exhaustive}} search techniques identify balanced symmetric stacking sequences that minimise elastic energy to produce optimal structural efficiency under combined loading. Constraints {{are added to}} account for use of standard ply angles, laminate design rules and damage tolerance. The damage tolerant strength constraint produces a bilevel optimization problem: surface plies are orientated to sufficiently minimise energy available for sublaminate buckling driven delamination propagation; <b>core</b> <b>plies</b> are orientated to maximise stiffness {{in response to a}} uniaxial load case. The proposed methodology demonstrates that current, standard ply angle, aerospace designs can be near optimal for undamaged strength. However, continuous angles and relaxation of design rules offer significant scope for improved damage tolerance...|$|R
40|$|A fiber {{composite}} airfoil, typical for high-tip speed compressor applications, {{is subjected to}} load conditions anticipated to be encountered in such applications, and its structural response is theoretically investigated. The analysis method used consists of composite mechanics embedded in pre- and post-processors and coupled with NASTRAN. The load conditions examined include thermal due to aerodynamic heating, pressure due to aerodynamic forces, centrifugal, and combinations of these. The various responses investigated include root reactions due to various load conditions, average composite and ply stresses, ply delaminations, and the fundamental modes and the corresponding reactions. The {{results show that the}} thermal and pressure stresses are negligible compared to those caused by the centrifugal forces. Also, the core-shell concept for composite blades is an inefficient design (<b>core</b> <b>plies</b> not highly stressed) and appears to be sensitive to interply delaminations. The results are presented in graphical and tabular forms to illustrate the types and amount of data required for such an analysis, and to provide quantitative data of the various responses which can be helpful in designing such composite blades...|$|R

40|$|Sandwich panels have a {{very high}} {{stiffness}} to weight ratio, which makes them particularly useful in the aerospace industry where carbon fibre reinforced plastics and lightweight honeycomb cores are being used in the construction of floor panels, fairings and intake barrel panels. In the latter case, the geometry of the panels can be considered doubly curved. This paper presents an introduction to an ongoing study investigating the dynamic response prediction of acoustically excited composite sandwich panels which have double curvature. The final objective is to assess and hopefully produce an up to date set of acoustic fatigue design guidelines for this type of structure. The free vibration of doubly curved composite honeycomb sandwich panels is investigated here, both experimentally and theoretically, the latter using a commercially available finite element package. The design and manufacture of three test panels is covered before presenting experimental results for the natural frequencies of vibration with freely supported boundary conditions. Once validated against the experimental results, the theoretical investigation is extended to study the effects of changing radii of curvature, orthotropic properties of the <b>core,</b> and <b>ply</b> orientation on the natural frequencies of vibration of rectangular panels with various boundary conditions. The results from the parameter studies show curve veering, particularly when studying the effect of changing radii and ply orientation, however, {{it is not clear whether}} this phenomenon is due to the approximation method used or occurs in the physical system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this research, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is {{employed}} {{to characterize the}} influence of material configuration on the damage tolerance and residual strength characteristics of sandwich composites. Test specimens used were comprised of carbon-epoxy woven fabric facesheets, and Nomex honeycomb cores. The ranges of the material configuration used are typical of those employed in aircraft applications. A series of carefully selected tests were used to isolate the coupled influence of various combinations {{of the number of}} facesheet <b>plies,</b> <b>core</b> density, and core thickness on the damage formation and residual strength degradation due to normal impact. Response surface estimates suggest that impact damage development and residual strength degradation are highly material and lay-up configuration dependent. Increasing the core thickness for a specific number of facesheet plies resulted in decreasing the impact damage, whereas increasing the number of facesheet plies for a given core thickness resulted in enhancing the residual strength. The derived damage tolerance and residual strength models can lead {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanical behavior of the impact-damaged sandwich composites, and hence improve their design and expand their applications. Sandwich composites, damage tolerance, response surface methods, Box–Behnken design,...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a {{bachelor}} thesis focusing on the chassis of a Formula Student race car. The main goal of the project is to achieve a guide of how to design the perfect chassis. This is done by identifying the areas most vital to chassis performance and exploring these by studies and analyses. An introduction to what Formula Student is, how it works and why the chassis of the cars are relevant to study is provided. A brief summary of chassis design aspects is included in order make sure the reader understands the methods and results of this report. The main focus is to identify key performance indicators of a race car chassis. This requires a comprehensive analysis concerningall aspects of the chassis. Therefore, a static model is developed to investigate the effects of chassis rigidity,material options are researched on, aerodynamic properties are explored, performance simulations are conductedandguidelines forcomposite chassis design and manufacturingare established. The most important key performance indicators were found to be weight, torsional stiffness and the torsional stiffness to weight ratio. Chassis rigidity is found to decrease exponentially with increasing torsional stiffness. This led to the conclusion that, having a torsional stiffness of more than ~ 3 times the roll stiffness, easily adds more weight than handling performance. The choice of a carbon composite structure for the chassis over a steel space frame leads to great weight savings without compromisingon performance. Despite the disadvantages with a carbon composite chassis, namely high cost and difficulty in manufacturing, the conclusion is that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. There are numerous material configurations available when using carbon composites and it is important to examine these configurations closely to find one that best satisfies the performance requirements. The selection process is simplified by using finite element analysis to iterate through many different configurations, such as <b>core</b> thicknesses, <b>ply</b> layups and weave types, to customize the properties of the structure. With these properties it is possible to determine chassis performance in terms of vehicle handling and rigidity...|$|R
40|$|Two {{items of}} Tailorable Advanced Blanket Insulation (TABI) for Advanced Space Transportation Systems were produced. The first {{consisted}} of flat panels made from integrally woven, 3 -D fluted core having parallel fabric faces and connecting ribs of Nicalon silicon carbide yarns. The triangular {{cross section of}} the flutes were filled with mandrels of processed Q-Fiber Felt. Forty panels were prepared with only minimal problems, mostly resulting from the unavailability of insulation with the proper density. Rigidizing the fluted fabric prior to inserting the insulation reduced the production time. The procedures for producing the fabric, insulation mandrels, and TABI panels are described. The second item was an effort to determine the feasibility of producing contoured TABI shapes from gores cut from flat, insulated fluted core panels. Two gores of integrally woven fluted <b>core</b> and single <b>ply</b> fabric (ICAS) were insulated and joined into a large spherical shape employing a tadpole insulator at the mating edges. The fluted core segment of each ICAS consisted of an Astroquartz face fabric and Nicalon face and rib fabrics, while the single ply fabric segment was Nicalon. Further development will be required. The success of fabricating this assembly indicates that this concept may be feasible for certain types of space insulation requirements. The procedures developed for weaving the ICAS, joining the gores, and coating certain areas of the fabrics are presented...|$|R
