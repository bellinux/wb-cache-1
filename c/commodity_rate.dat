40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} that affect {{the health of a}} {{semi-arid}} region's eco-economy is necessary for its sustainable development. The health evaluation, or diagnoses, of an eco-economy at the small watershed scale requires the integrated analysis of ecological, economic, and social factors, yet few studies have achieved this. The health of an eco-economy comprises three components: vigor, organization, and resilience. We use an analytic hierarchy process to develop a health evaluation index system that evaluates the health of an eco-economy system. We then use this diagnostic method to explore the factors affecting the health status of a semi-arid loess watershed in China in 2007 and 2009. The results show that between 2007 and 2009 the health status of the eco-economy improved from the better stage to the benign circle stage. The primary productivity of grassland, land productivity, rural per capita net income, number of livestock per household, input-output ratio, <b>commodity</b> <b>rate</b> of farm produce, and labor productivity were the main factors influencing the health of this eco-economy. Furthermore, this study shows that the eco-economy depends on material input from regions outside the watershed...|$|E
40|$|Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party, {{there has}} emerged in our country an unprecedentedly {{favorable}} situation of flourishing development {{in the area of}} agricultural production. In 1979 - 1981, gross agricultural output increased at an average annual rate of 5. 6 percent, which is greatly in excess of the average annual increase rate of 4. 3 percent for 1950 - 1978. In the wake of this development, there has also been a remarkable enhancement of the <b>commodity</b> <b>rate</b> of agricultural products. In 1979 - 1981, the national gross requisitioning and procurement amount of agricultural and sideline products increased at an average annual rate of 19. 6 percent. Furthermore, the ratio of the amount of requisition and procurement of agricultural sideline products to the gross agricultural production value has consistently risen, from the 38. 2 percent of 1978 to 45 percent in 1979, 51. 7 percent in 1980, and 55. 5 percent in 1981. These major annual increases in the requisition and procurement of agricultural and sideline products not only have ensured the supply of industrial raw materials and the people's means of consumption and eased the tension that has long existed between agricultural development and the people's needs, but have also increased accumulation of communes and production brigades and teams, and peasants' income, thus promoting further development in agricultural production. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>commodity</b> own <b>rates</b> of interest in intertemporal analysis of consumer behaviour and presents a disaggregate analysis of intertemporal substitution in commodity demand and consumption. <b>Commodity</b> <b>rates</b> of interest are defined from the Euler equations implied by the intertemporal consumer choice problem. The relationship between <b>commodity</b> own <b>rates</b> and the real interest rate is derived, and the conditions for equality of <b>commodity</b> own <b>rates</b> are discussed. The intertemporal commodity substitution elasticities are characterised using <b>commodity</b> <b>rates</b> of interest, and the intertemporal substitution elasticity of consumption is derived from its constituent commodity demands. Evidence from estimation of the demand system and the consumption function reveals high intertemporal substitution for consumer goods as well as consumption.

40|$|Abstract. We {{analyze the}} effects of a {{generalized}} class of negative consumption ex-ternalities (asymmetric and non-atmospheric) on the structure of efficient commodity tax programs. Households are not only concerned about consumption reference levels — that is, they gain utility from “keeping up with the Joneses ” — they also exhibit altruism. Two sets of efficient tax regimes are compared, based, on a welfarist- and a non-welfarist optimality criterion, respectively. Altruism turns out not to be at odds with the consumption externalities. Rather, altruism implicates a bound on efficient utility allocations. A non-welfarist government tolerates less inequality than a wel-farist one. In the welfarist (non-welfarist) case, first-best personalized <b>commodity</b> tax <b>rates</b> respond highly sensitively (barely) to whether or not a consumption externality is asymmetric or non-atmospheric. If personalized <b>commodity</b> tax <b>rates</b> are not available (second-best case), the tax rate on a non-positional good is typically different from zero for corrective reasons. For plausible functional forms and parameter values, numerical simulations suggest that second-best tax rates are rather insensitive with respect to both the optimality criterion and the “nature ” of the consumption externality...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDeciding {{shipment}} size {{is important}} in freight transport: {{it depends on the}} logistical imperatives of shippers and the technical possibilities of carriers. Shipment size choice is also closely related to transportation mode; it is therefore important from a public policy perspective. The theory of optimal shipment size and mode choice is robust. There are many inventory-theoretical models of optimal shipment size, applied by shippers in operational contexts. However, none of them has been validated empirically over a large and heterogeneous population of shipments, so that they are virtually useless for modeling freight transportation demand. This is due in particular to the lack of adequate data. In this paper, the simple Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model is assessed empirically on a national scale, over a heterogeneous population of shipments. Using the French ECHO database, which notably observes <b>commodity</b> flow <b>rates</b> between shippers and receivers, the EOQ shipment size specification is estimated. The validity of the EOQ model is confirmed. In addition, the dominant role of the <b>commodity</b> flow <b>rate</b> between the shipper and the receiver, and of commodity value density is revealed. The relationship between mode choice and shipment size is also highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the next}} several years, crop prices are {{projected}} to be below to slightly above <b>commodity</b> loan <b>rates.</b> As a result, marketing loan benefits to farmers, {{in the form of}} loan deficiency payments and marketing loan gains from the commodity loan program, are likely to continue to be sizeable. The level of realized per-unit revenues facilitated by marketing loans exceeds <b>commodity</b> loan <b>rates,</b> thereby raising expected net returns to farmers. Model simulations show that the loan program can raise total acreage planted to major field crops, generally increasing levels of domestic use and exports while lowering crop prices. Cross-commodity effects of supply response to relative returns (including marketing loan benefits), however, result in acreage shifts among competing crops, which can lead to reductions in plantings of some crops in some years. Most impacts occur in the years when there are marketing loan benefits, with little effect in subsequent years when prices rise high enough to eliminate marketing loan benefits. The livestock sector benefits from these outcomes because of generally lower feed costs.
