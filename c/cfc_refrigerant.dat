R 507 A is azeotropic mixture composed of HFC refrigerants R 125 /R 143 a (50 %/ 50 % wt.). R 23 {{is a single}} component HFC refrigerant used as replacement to <b>CFC</b> <b>refrigerant</b> R 13 in low temperature applications. These refrigerants have zero ozone depletion potential and are non-flammable and as R 507 A an azeotropic mixture {{there is no problem}} of temperature glide. This study thermodynamically analyzed R 507 A-R 23 cascade refrigeration system to optimize the design and operating parameters of the system. The design and operating parameters include: Condensing, evaporating, subcooling and superheating temperatures in the high temperature circuit, temperature difference in the cascade heat exchanger, Condensing, evaporating, subcooling and superheating temperatures in the low temperature circuit.

40|$|Nanorefrigerants and nanolubricants {{are formed}} when {{nanoparticles}} are dispersed in refrigerant/lubricant based. The use of nanorefrigerants or refrigerant with nanolubricant mixtures {{is one of}} the passive techniques in enhanced heat transfer performance and reducing energy consumption. This paper reviews the augmentation of heat transfer, enhancement of coefficients of performance (COP) and energy efficiency of various nanoparticle dispersions in the refrigerants or lubricants based on refrigerant type. From the results available in the literatures, it shows that nanorefrigerants and refrigerant/nanolubricant mixtures enhances the heat transfer coefficient. Furthermore, the augmentation of heat transfer coefficient depends on the concentrations and size of the particles. Increment of concentration also increases the viscosity, and consequently, the pressure drop. Moreover, from the review, most of the researchers tend to use R 134 a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) as the refrigerant base. Even though the use of chlorofluorocarbon (<b>CFC)</b> <b>refrigerant</b> had been banned, it is still favored by some researchers as it is easy to prepare the nanorefrigerant mixtures in a liquid state with atmosphere pressure and room temperature. The limited research of nanorefrigerants in using hydrocarbon (HC) refrigerant base is due to its flammability issues. Nevertheless, it is strongly suggested that the research based on this environmental friendly refrigerant such as HC need to be conducted extensively...|$|E
40|$|Air {{conditioning}} cabin of a {{transport truck}} {{is a new}} concept in India {{and has not been}} addressed. But in summer, the temperature in some parts of India is very high and results in unbearable cabin temperatures. In such conditions, an air cooled cabin for transport truck is a necessity. It is observed that much work has not been done in the field of cabin cooling of transport truck. The available options in heat generated cooling have been critically reviewed. The vapour absorption refrigeration cycle is found to be suitable for automobile air cooling especially for transport trucks. The heat potential in the exhaust has been analyzed and found to be sufficient enough for powering the proposed air conditioning system. The significance of the work is that it will provide space cooling for the truck driver and thereby enhances his performance and efficiency without affecting performance of the engine essentially the fuel economy. Further the vapor absorption cycle use non <b>CFC</b> <b>refrigerant</b> and thereby have little effect on environment. The present work is focused towards the design and development of an air cooling system for the cabin of truck using waste heat from exhaust.

It was then followed up with Montreal Protocol in September 1987 consisting supervision rules on producing, consuming, and treading ozone damaging materials. The government of Indonesia had ratified the convention through President Decree Number 23 Year 1999. The ozone layer reservation program implementation in Indonesia is facilitated by KLH.

40|$|Halons {{have long}} been the fire suppressants of choice for {{applications}} requiring high performance. However, halons {{are linked to the}} stratospheric ozone depletion problem. The most common halon, 1301 or CF{sub 3 }Br, has an ozone depletion potential (ODP) 11 times higher than the most common chlorofluorocarbon (<b>CFC)</b> <b>refrigerant.</b> This has led to a ban on halon production under the Clean Air Act legislation in the US following the Montreal Protocols on ozone depleting substances. Halon replacements are being actively sought for new fire suppression systems and to retrofit existing systems as the current supply of halons is exhausted. One promising replacement is CF{sub 3 }I. This compound has been shown to have fire suppression performance similar to that achieved for halon 1301, but with a very low ODP. Unlike halon 1301, CF{sub 3 }I rapidly photolyzes in the troposphere, and thus has a tropospheric lifetime of less than two days. However, CF{sub 3 }I is not the perfect replacement; it has performed poorly in cardiac sensitization studies and is approved only for total flooding applications in unoccupied spaces and streaming applications. In this study, they seek to build a model for the suppression of hydrogen fires by CF{sub 3 }I. From a fundamental viewpoint, the hydrogen combustion mechanism is appealing because it is the simplest and best characterized of all combustion mechanisms, and an important sub-mechanism of all hydrocarbon combustion mechanisms. Thus, a high-performance hydrogen fire suppressant would almost certainly be an excellent suppressant for most other common fires. One-dimensional, laminar flame calculations are used to determine the major fire suppression mechanisms of CF{sub 3 }I. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: first, the model is described in detail; second, the experimental method and results are presented and finally, the authors compare the model and experimental results and discuss the major reaction pathways and suppression mechanisms of CF{sub 3 }I in hydrogen flames...|$|E
40|$|Chillers are a {{significant}} component of large facility energy use. The focus {{of much of the}} development of chilled water systems {{in recent years has been}} on optimization of set point and staging controls, improvements in chiller design to increase efficiency and accommodate chlorofluorocarbon (<b>CFC)</b> <b>refrigerant</b> replacements. Other improvements have been made by upgrading controls to the latest digital technologies, improving access and monitoring via communications and sophisticated liquid crystal displays (LCD), more robust fault diagnostics and operating and maintenance information logging. Advances have also been made in how chiller plant systems are designed and operated, and in the diversity of chiller products that are available to support innovative approaches. As in many industries, these improvements have been facilitated by advances in, and lower costs for, enabling technologies, such as refrigerants, compressor design, electronics for controls and variable frequency drives (VFD). Along with the improvements in electronics one would expect that advances have also been made in the functionality of unit controls included with chillers. Originally, the primary purpose of this project was to investigate the state of practice of chiller unit controllers in terms of their energy saving capabilities. However, early in the study it was discovered that advances in this area did not include incorporation of significantly different capabilities than had existed 10 - 15 years ago. Thus the scope has been modified to provide an overview of some of the basic controls-related energy saving strategies that are currently available along with guideline estimates of their potential and applicability. We have minimized consideration of strategies that could be primarily implemented via design practices such as chiller selection and plant design, and those that can only be implemented by a building management system (BMS). Also, since most of the floor space of federal buildings occurs in large buildings, we have focused on water-cooled screw and centrifugal chillers of 100 ton capacity and greater. However, the role of reciprocating and gas chillers (absorption and engine driven) is discussed briefly. Understanding the demographics of chiller deployment in the federal sector, state of practice of energy savings strategies and control features availability will help federal energy managers and program implementers to make informed decisions in support of energy saving performance contracting (ESPC) and other programs...|$|E

Local heat transfer coefficients over a range of heat fluxes, mass fluxes, and equilibrium mass qualities were measured. The measured coefficients were used to evaluate eight different heat transfer correlations, {{some of which have}} been developed specifically for refrigerants. High heat fluxes and low flow rates are inherent in small channels, and this combination results in high boiling numbers. The high boiling number of the collected data shows that the nucleation mechanism was dominant. As a result, the two-phase correlations that predicted this dominance also predicted the data best if they also properly modeled the physical parameters.

40|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{have led}} to the phase out of chlorofluorocarbon (<b>CFC)</b> <b>refrigerants</b> from the domestic refrigeration industry. One intriguing aspect is that the chlorine in CFCs is a good lubricating agent and any deterioration of system performance may adversely influence other environmental considerations. Based on the above, the aim of this research is to address the sustainable development of domestic refrigeration systems using the replacement refrigerant HFC- 134 a. The work focuses on the emissions that may arise if the electrical consumption of the product deteriorates or its durability is curtailed. Tribological characteristics on compressor components influence both of these product attributes and therefore a thorough system analysis was carried out. An in-house built experimental test rig, which monitored slight variations in the electrical power drawn by a reciprocating hermetic compressor, was used under different experimental conditions. Furthermore, a detailed life cycle assessment on a domestic refrigerator was performed to help quantify the ensuing environmental burdens. In this way, a relation between tribological characteristics, power consumption and environmental impact was studied. Results have shown that the CFC substitute will increase friction and wear characteristics on the aluminium alloy connecting rod and the steel gudgeon pin. These characteristics led to an increase in the electrical energy consumption of the compressor such that the indirect global warming implications are set to rise with HFC- 134 a. If the sustainable development of this product is to be ascertained then a change in refrigerants alone will not suffice. New design considerations, primarily aimed at servicing and extending the life of the hermetic compressor itself, are considered.

(1996) was also programmed and compared to flow regimes observed for HFC 407 C. It predicted the HFC 407 C flow pattern data quite accurately. The original objective of the HFC 407 C measurements was the validation of the Kattan et al. (1996) correlation applied to a zeotropic refrigerant blend. Local flow boiling heat transfer coefficients were measured for HFC 407 C evaporating inside a microfin and plain tube. In addition, microfin heat transfer augmentation relative to a plain tube was investigated. The presence of oil in the evaporator had a complex effect on heat transfer coefficients. Local flow boiling heat transfer coefficients were measured for refrigerant HFC 407 C ester oil mixtures (Mobil EAL Arctic 68). A new thermodynamic approach for modeling mixtures of zeotropic refrigerant blends and lubricating oils was also developed. A very high accuracy, straight vibrating tube type of density flowmeter was used to measure oil concentrations of flowing HFC 407 C oil mixtures. The test covered oil concentration from 0. 5 - 5 wt. % oil. A method was proposed to predict thermodynamic and transport properties of the refrigerant-oil mixtures. In addition, a first empirical approach was proposed for predicting heat transfer for boiling of refrigerant-oil mixtures. Based on this work, the following phenomena important to the problem were identified that require further investigation: • oil retention in the evaporator tubes that was found and clearly proved in the present project. • the formation of foam in the HFC 407 C/oil mixture (but not in the previous HFC 134 a/oil tests) •the effect of oil on flow patterns, in particular stratified and stratified-wavy flows...|$|R
