I sent for an ambulance, and {{he was taken to}} hospital. I also noticed that ten of my sleeping tablets were missing." [...] In a statement given to P. Weyell of the coroner's office on September 24, she said: I made a sandwich and we talked until about 7 a.m. He then said that {{he wanted to go to}} sleep. He took some tablets, and we went to bed. I woke up about 11:00 a.m., and saw that Jimi's face was covered in vomit. I tried to wake him but could not. I called an ambulance and he was taken to the hospital in Kensington... Prior to going with him to the hospital, I <b>checked</b> <b>my</b> supply of Vesparax sleeping tablets and found that nine of them were missing.|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey was {{surprised}} by the attention. She was new to Twitter and Instagram, and did not know what shipping (the desire by fans for two people or fictional characters to be in a romantic or platonic relationship) meant; she saw that fans had given the pairing the portmanteau [...] "Clexa". [...] "I was on Instagram or something and I <b>checked</b> <b>my</b> tagged photos, and I realized that suddenly they were all LGBT artwork. I was like, 'Oh, my god!' I had no idea. It was the first time I realized I was a figure for that community," [...] said Debnam-Carey. She called this [...] "an honor" [...] and [...] "flattering," [...] and added, [...] "It's new for our society, as well. It's one of the first shows that really has two characters in the cast that are gender and sexually fluid and embraces that. There are no labels. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of. I'm all for it." [...] While at Paleyfest 2016, she was made aware of fans raising money in her name for The Trevor Project, an organization for LGBT teenagers in need, and the fact that, at the time, $46,000 dollars had been raised. When asked if she knew she had that much of an impact on the LGBT community, Debnam-Carey commented, [...] "Not that much, no, that's amazing." [...] As of July 13, 2016, over $135,000 dollars have been raised.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I haven't," [...] I {{answered}} curtly. He <b>checked</b> <b>my</b> {{movement to}} rise by an austere, commanding gesture {{of the hand}} holding that fatal shoe. I remained seated and glared at him. [...] "You know I don't trade." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{stepped out}} into the saloon with my heart lighter than it had been for days. Ransome was at the {{sideboard}} preparing to lay the table for the first sea dinner of the passage. He turned his head, and something in his eyes <b>checked</b> <b>my</b> modest elation.|$|E
6000|$|She turned whiter yet--white as the dead--and a look grew {{upon her}} face that <b>checked</b> <b>my</b> foolish mirth.

60|$|I {{listened as}} I had never listened before; I listened like {{the evening and}} winter-wolf, {{snuffing}} the snow, scenting prey, and hearing far off the traveller's tramp. Yet I could both listen and write. About {{the middle of the}} letter I heard--what <b>checked</b> <b>my</b> pen--a tread in the vestibule. No door-bell had rung; Rosine--acting doubtless by orders--had anticipated such réveillée. Madame saw me halt. She coughed, made a bustle, spoke louder. The tread had passed on to the classes.|$|E
6000|$|Some {{reflection}} {{seemed to}} sting him, and the spasm of pain {{that for a}} moment convulsed his countenance, <b>checked</b> <b>my</b> indignation. [...] "Happy are dreamers," [...] he continued, [...] "so that they be not awakened! Would I could dream! but 'broad and garish day' is the element in which I live; the dazzling glare of reality inverts the scene for me. Even the ghost of friendship has departed, and love"----He broke off; nor could I guess whether the disdain that curled his lip was directed against the passion, or against himself for being its slave.|$|E
60|$|I was {{certainly}} off my balance, a prey to impulse, {{for at the}} bottom of the stairs I turned and flung myself at the doorway of Mr. Burns' cabin. The wildness of his aspect <b>checked</b> <b>my</b> mental disorder. He was sitting up in his bunk, his body looking immensely long, his head drooping a little sideways, with affected complacency. He flourished, in his trembling hand, on the end of a forearm no thicker than a walking-stick, a shining pair of scissors which he tried before my very eyes to jab at his throat.|$|E

60|$|It {{was in this}} {{mood that}} I became {{conscious}} of a shadow object near {{the foot of a}} rise. It did not seem a natural portion of the prairie, and when I had covered some distance it resolved itself into a horse and a dismounted man. His broad hat hung low in his hand, his head was bent, and he stood so intent that I had almost ridden up to him before he turned and noticed me. Then, as I <b>checked</b> <b>my</b> horse, I saw that it was Boone.|$|E
6000|$|From {{that day}} dated my {{acquaintance}} with Muhammad Din. Never again {{did he come}} into my dining-room, but on the neutral ground of the compound, we greeted each other with much state, though our conversation was confined to [...] "Talaam, Tahib" [...] from his side and [...] "Salaam Muhammad Din" [...] from mine.

60|$|After partaking {{of bitter}} maté, I thanked my hostess, looked my last into Monica's dark, sorrowful eyes, lifted {{for one moment}} to mine, and kissed little Anita's pathetic face, by so doing filling the child with astonishment and causing {{considerable}} amusement to {{the other members of}} the family. After we had ridden about four miles, keeping nearly parallel with the river, it struck me that we were not going in the right direction--the right one for me, at any rate. I therefore <b>checked</b> <b>my</b> horse and told my companions that I would not trouble them to ride with me any further.|$|E
