5000|$|An unusual {{aspect of}} the album release in the UK {{was the use of}} {{coloured}} vinyl, then primarily restricted to singles and EP's, and soon replaced as a marketing gimmick by so-called [...] "picture discs".

5000|$|The GWR was nationalised in 1948, {{becoming}} the Western Region of British Railways. In 1949, BR decided {{to adopt the}} London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) system of power classification for all locomotives. Despite this, {{the use of a}} letter to denote power classification continued to be used on former GWR steam locomotives, as did the <b>coloured</b> <b>disc</b> for weight classification; both continued until the end of steam traction on the Western Region in 1965. Certain ex-LMS and BR Standard steam locomotives allocated to the Western Region were given GWR style route classification discs, usually without the power class letter. Some of these had the BR power class shown on the disc as a figure; for example, the Class 5 4-6-0 bore the figure [...] "5" [...] on a red disc. The <b>coloured</b> <b>disc</b> was also applied to some diesel locomotives allocated to the Western Region.|$|E

50|$|On 1 July 1905 the Great Western Railway (GWR) {{introduced}} {{a system for}} denoting both the haulage capabilities and the weight restrictions which applied to their various classes of locomotive. Originally this was used only in record books, but from mid 1919 began to be shown on the locomotives themselves. The weight restriction was shown {{in the form of}} a <b>coloured</b> <b>disc,</b> and the power classification was denoted by a capital letter placed upon the disc. At first these were painted high on the cab side, but during World War II the blackout precautions meant that staff had to be careful using lights at night, so the disc and letter were moved downwards to a position just above the engine number plate, to make them easier to see.|$|E
50|$|Before {{allowing}} {{a train to}} enter a block, a signalman must be certain {{that it is not}} already occupied. When a train leaves a block, he must inform the signalman controlling entry to the block. Even if the signalman receives advice that the previous train has left a block, he is usually required to seek permission from the next signal box to admit the next train. When a train arrives {{at the end of a}} block section, before the signalman sends the message that the train has arrived, he must be able to see the end-of-train marker on the back of the last vehicle. This ensures that no part of the train has become detached and remains within the section. The end of train marker might be a <b>coloured</b> <b>disc</b> (usually red) by day or a coloured oil or electric lamp (again, usually red). If a train enters the next block before the signalman sees that the disc or lamp is missing, he asks the next signal box to stop the train and investigate.|$|E
50|$|Time Bomb: The other {{eight players}} {{were taken to}} Fort Nepean, a mostly idle old fort with lots of tunnels, gun emplacements, {{ammunition}} stores, lookout points, and bunkers. In one bunker was a time bomb. The host told the players to pick two of them who were comfortable in confined spaces. These two were John and Michael, who were put into the bunker with the time bomb and told that to defuse it, they must cut four differently coloured wires in the correct sequence. The other six split up to look for four brainteaser puzzles placed at the fort. The correct answer to each corresponded to a colour, which they were to then give to John and Michael. If they solved all four puzzles, they'd have the correct wires and the bomb could be defused, adding $10,000 to the kitty. The others all found their puzzles and retrieved a <b>coloured</b> <b>disc</b> corresponding to the correct wire to cut, but Hal and Helen never actually found theirs and simply picked a piece of coloured wire up off the ground, thinking it was what they were sent to find. John and Michael ultimately cut orange, pink, purple and yellow wires in succession, and the timer did not stop. An explosion of smoke signified their failure. Afterward, the host informed them that the answer {{was in front of}} John and Michael the whole time - the manufacturer name on the bomb canister was PYRO Explosives, Inc. - that's pink, yellow, red, and orange wires in succession.|$|E
40|$|Does any one {{psychological}} process {{give rise}} to visual awareness? One candidate is selective attention—when we attend to something it seems we always see it. But if attention can selectively enhance our response to an unseen stimulus then attention cannot be a sufficient precondition for awareness. Kentridge, Heywood & Weiskrantz [Kentridge, R. W., Heywood, C. A., & Weiskrantz, L. (1999). Attention without awareness in blindsight. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B, 266, 1805 – 1811; Kentridge, R. W., Heywood, C. A., & Weiskrantz, L. (2004). Spatial attention speeds discrimination without awareness in blindsight. Neuropsychologia, 42, 831 – 835. ] demonstrated just such a dissociation in the blindsight subject GY. Here, we test whether the dissociation generalizes to the normal population. We presented observers with pairs of <b>coloured</b> <b>discs,</b> each masked by the subsequent presentation of a <b>coloured</b> annulus. The <b>discs</b> acted as primes, speeding discrimination of the colour of the annulus when they matched in colour and slowing it when they differed. We show that the location of attention modulated {{the size of this}} priming effect. However, the primes were rendered invisible by metacontrast-masking and remained unseen despite being attended. Visual attention could therefore facilitate processing of an invisible target and cannot, therefore, be a sufficient precondition for visual awareness...|$|R

50|$|The use of {{transparent}} materials {{enables the}} creation of puzzles, in which pieces have to be stacked {{on top of each}} other. The aim is to create a specific pattern, image or colour scheme in the solution.

These findings are characteristic of a serial search in primates, when stimuli are examined sequentially. We found no evidence for parallel search in bees, which would be characterized by a "pop out" effect, in which the slope of decision time (and accuracy) over distractor number would be near zero. Additionally, we found that decision time and number of errors were significantly higher when bees had to choose a blue target among yellow distractors compared with the inverse colour combination, a phenomenon known as search asymmetry in humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{spectral}} sensitivity of single photoreceptors of Osmia rufa {{was determined by}} a fast voltage-clamp technique. Three receptor types were found whose {{spectral sensitivity}} functions followed a rhodopsin-like photopigment absorption function with A,,, ^ values at 348 nm (ultraviolet receptor), 436 nm (blue receptor) and 572 nm (green receptor). The Amax of the green receptor in Osmia rufa is shifted to much longer wavelengths compared with other insect species. Discrimi-nation of colour signals was tested after training a bee {{at the entrance to}} its nest. The colour signals were filter discs (70 mm in diameter) with a hole (10 mm in diameter) in the centre and the bees quickly learned to use the <b>coloured</b> <b>disc</b> as a marker of the nest entrance. Tests were dual forced-choice tests with two coloured discs closely positioned next to each other. 94 different tests were each repeated 5 - 15 times and were performed after training to 12 different colour signals. A photoreceptor model was used to calculate the loci of the colour signals in a three-dimensional colour space and in a chromaticity diagram. The perceptual distance between the colour loci was calculated as line elements (minimu...|$|E
40|$|Four {{experiments}} examined attentional capture by colour as {{assessed by}} two different investigative methods. Subjects performed a visual search task for a vertical-target line embedded among tilted-distractor lines, presented inside 4, 8, or 12 <b>coloured</b> <b>discs.</b> Interestingly, when the colour singleton was task irrelevant, and data were analysed {{by means of}} the display-size method combined with the zero-slope criterion, no evidence for attentional capture by colour was found. However, when data were analysed {{by means of the}} distance method, which consists of monitoring the spatial relationship between the target and the singleton, results showed that the target was found faster and/or more accurately when it was inside the singleton than when it was in a nonsingleton location. This provided evidence for a stimulus-driven attentional capture. In addition, the application of signal detection methodology showed that attentional capture, as revealed by the distance method, resulted from a perceptual modulation at the singleton location, rather than from a criterion shift. We conclude that, at least with the kind of stimuli used here, the display-size method combined with the zero-slope criterion is less than ideal for investigating how static discontinuities can affect the automatic deployment of visual attention...|$|R
40|$|Apparatus. The {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} a chamber whose illumination was under computer control. Subjects were seated {{at a distance of}} 130 cm from the wall in front of the chamber. The monitor was placed in a tunnel 57 cm behind the wall, and was viewed through an opening of 10. 6 × 8 deg. Stimuli were displayed on a Sony GDM-F 520 CRT monitor with a spatial resolution of 800 × 600 pixels and refresh rate of 120 Hz, driven by a Cambridge Research VSG graphics card. The C. I. E. 1931 chromaticity of the white point of the monitor was x = 0. 32, y = 0. 34 with a luminance of 29 cd m-. Calibration of the setup is described in detail in Rinner & Gegenfurtner (2002). Stimuli. Seven digitized photographs of fruit and vegetables were selected as stimuli due to their distinct object colour. Each stimulus contained one fruit object on a grey background. As control stimuli we used homogeneously <b>coloured</b> <b>discs</b> and noise discs with an amplitude spectrum resembling the average amplitude spectrum of natural scenes (1 /f, pink noise). The stimuli were defined in the DKL colour space, which is spanned by a luminance axis (L + M) and two chromatic axes (L – M and S – (L + M) ...|$|R
5000|$|Steering was difficult, {{controlled}} by varying {{the speed of}} the two tracks. Four of the crew, two drivers (one of whom also acted as commander; he operated the brakes, the other the primary gearbox) and two [...] "gearsmen" [...] (one for the secondary gears of each track) were needed to control direction and speed, the latter never more than a walking pace. As the noise inside was deafening, the driver, after setting the primary gear box, communicated with the gearsmen with hand signals, first getting their attention by hitting the engine block with a heavy spanner. For slight turns, the driver could use the steering tail: an enormous contraption dragged behind the tank consisting of two large wheels, each of which could be blocked by pulling a steel cable causing the whole vehicle to slide in the same direction. If the engine stalled, the gearsmen would use the starting handle - a large crank between the engine and the gearbox. Many of these vehicles broke down in the heat of battle making them an easy target for German gunners. There was no wireless (radio); communication with command posts was by means of two pigeons, which had their own small exit hatch in the sponsons, or by runners. Because of the noise and vibration, early experiments had shown that radios were impractical, therefore lamps, flags, semaphore, <b>coloured</b> <b>discs,</b> and the carrier pigeons were part of the standard equipment of the various marks.|$|R

40|$|The {{idea that}} {{language}} can affect how {{we see the}} world continues to create controversy. A potentially important study in this field has shown that when an object is suppressed from visual awareness using continuous flash suppression (a form of binocular rivalry), detection of the object is differently affected by a preceding word prime {{depending on whether the}} prime matches or does not match the object. This may suggest that language can affect early stages of vision. We replicated this paradigm and further investigated whether colour terms likewise influence the detection of colours or colour-associated object images suppressed from visual awareness by continuous flash suppression. This method presents rapidly changing visual noise to one eye while the target stimulus is presented to the other. It has been shown to delay conscious perception of a target for up to several minutes. In Experiment 1 we presented greyscale photos of objects. They were either preceded by a congruent object label, an incongruent label, or white noise. Detection sensitivity (d') and hit rates were significantly poorer for suppressed objects preceded by an incongruent label compared to a congruent label or noise. In Experiment 2, targets were <b>coloured</b> <b>discs</b> preceded by a colour term. Detection sensitivity was significantly worse for suppressed colour patches preceded by an incongruent colour term as compared to a congruent term or white noise. In Experiment 3 targets were suppressed greyscale object images preceded by an auditory presentation of a colour term. On congruent trials the colour term matched the object's stereotypical colour and on incongruent trials the colour term mismatched. Detection sensitivity was significantly poorer on incongruent trials than congruent trials. Overall, these findings suggest that colour terms affect awareness of coloured stimuli and colour- associated objects, and provide new evidence for language-perception interaction in the brain...|$|R

50|$|St Thomas's {{is one of}} {{the grandest}} and most fully {{finished}} examples of High Victorian Gothic ecclesiastical architecture, not only in Belfast, but in Ulster. Built of white Scrabo sandstone with finely dressed masonry round doors and windows, it is adorned with red sandstone banding and <b>coloured</b> marble <b>discs</b> and colonnettes to the tower and spire. The exterior is a confident exercise in eclectic design: generally the style is Early French Gothic, but the polychrome effects point to an Italian Gothic influence. There may also be an Early Christian Irish reference in the round stone-capped stair turret. The date 1870 is inscribed over the north doorway. Probably because of constraints imposed by the sloping site, the orientation of St Thomas' is unusual, the chancel facing north. In 1888 the church was enlarged at the south end, to a John Lanyon design, when the southwest porch was added, as well as the internal gallery with its Gothic timber stairway. Along with the increase in the length of nave and aisles, this extended the seating capacity to over 1,000.|$|R
