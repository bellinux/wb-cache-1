5|$|Delsener {{presented}} {{the plan to}} Paul Simon {{in the summer of}} 1981. Simon was enthusiastic about the idea, but questioned whether it could be financially successful, especially given the poor audience attendance of his last project, the autobiographical movie One-Trick Pony. Simon's confidence had declined and he had sought treatment for depression. He questioned whether he and Art Garfunkel <b>could</b> <b>work</b> together, but contacted Garfunkel, who was vacationing in Switzerland. Garfunkel was excited about the idea, and immediately returned to the US.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} need rapid {{reversal}} of warfarin such as due to serious bleeding or need emergency surgery, the effects of warfarin can be reversed with vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in addition to intravenous vitamin K. Blood products should not be routinely used to reverse warfarin overdose when vitamin K <b>could</b> <b>work</b> alone. PCC {{has been found to}} be better than FFP when rapid reversal is needed.|$|E

5|$|In The Stuff of Thought (2007), Pinker {{looks at}} {{a wide range of}} issues around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life <b>could</b> <b>work</b> in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.|$|E
5|$|Representatives enthusiastically {{described}} {{a language that}} <b>could</b> <b>work</b> {{in a wide variety}} of environments, from banking and insurance to utilities and inventory control. They agreed unanimously that more people should be able to program and that the new language should not be restricted by the limitations of contemporary technology. A majority agreed that the language should make maximal use of English, be capable of change, be machine-independent and be easy to use, even at the expense of power.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Albuera {{had little}} effect on the overall course of the war, but it had shown that British and Spanish troops <b>could</b> <b>work</b> together. On the other hand, Anglo-Spanish {{political}} relations suffered following the battle. Wellington placed most of the blame for the losses on Blake, while a dispatch read in the Spanish cortes implied that the British had played only a minor role in the battle, despite their much higher losses.|$|E

Itoi {{had to choose}} a composer from the development team who understood the series and <b>could</b> <b>work</b> full-time on the project, including other development duties. Thus, he could not choose Suzuki, who was outside the project, or Hirokazu Tanaka, who had become the president of Creatures. Sakai also understood the game's story intimately and named the Magypsies after musical terms. He worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series.|$|E
5|$|Banks and Rutherford {{suggested}} the band take an extended hiatus, hoping Collins would save his marriage {{and that the}} band <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with him in Vancouver. Banks recorded a solo album A Curious Feeling in Polar Studios, Stockholm with Genesis touring drummer Chester Thompson and singer Kim Beacon, while Rutherford also recorded his first solo album, Smallcreep's Day, at the same studio. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after the attempt to salvage his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on the next Genesis album, he gigged with Brand X, and began work on demo tracks for what became his first solo album Face Value {{at his home in}} Shalford, Surrey. As well as playing piano and synthesizers, he had recently picked up a Roland drum machine and become interested in the possibilities of electronic drums.|$|E

As Steward of England, he personally- although accompanied by, for example, other lords such as Buckingham and the earl of Salisbury- arrested Humphrey, duke of Gloucester for treason, in Bury St Edmunds 18 February 1447.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 16th century, horse teams were {{beginning}} to replace ox teams in ploughing work in Britain because of their greater speed, strength and agility, particularly on lighter soils; in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage, both because they pulled more steadily, albeit more slowly, and because they <b>could</b> <b>work</b> despite being fed by grazing alone. While the horse collar, which allows a horse greater freedom to pull heavy loads, {{had been used in}} western Europe by the 10th century, and may be shown in the Bayeux Tapestry of the 11th or 12th century, the use of horse teams in Britain was made possible in part because of an increase in the farming of oats, a staple food for hard-working horses.|$|E
5|$|Commoners {{known as}} guests and {{retainers}} (binke 賓客) {{who lived on}} the property of a host in exchange for services had existed since the Warring States period. Retainers often originally belonged to other social groups, and sometimes they were fugitives seeking shelter from authorities. Hosts were often wealthy nobles and officials, yet they were sometimes wealthy commoners. In a typical relationship, a host provided lodging, food, clothing, and carriage transport for his retainers in return for occasional and non-routine work or services such as an advisory role, a post as bodyguard, menial physical labor around the house, and sometimes more dangerous missions such as committing assassinations, fighting off roving bandits, or riding into battle to defend the host. Others <b>could</b> <b>work</b> as spies, scholarly protégés, or astrologers.|$|E
5|$|Developed in the United States, the American Water Spaniel is the Wisconsin state dog. The breed {{originated}} in the areas along the Fox River and its tributary the Wolf River during the early 19th century. Hunters needed a dog that <b>could</b> <b>work</b> on both land and water, a versatile hunter skilled at bringing {{in a variety of}} game. Hunters also wanted a hunting dog compact enough to be transported in a small skiff, one that was able to withstand Wisconsin's cold water temperatures. Breeds involved {{in the creation of the}} American Water Spaniel are thought to have included the English Water Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever, native Indian Dogs, the Poodle, and either the Sussex Spaniel or another type of field spaniel.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern {{what ought to}} be done, insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of {{what ought to be}} done in a perfect world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that <b>could</b> <b>work</b> in the real world, capable of being presented as a solution to the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein {{published}} his paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies about special relativity. Born was intrigued, and began researching the subject. He was devastated {{to discover that}} Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines, but when he wrote to Minkowski about his results, Minkowski asked {{him to return to}} Göttingen and do his habilitation there. Born accepted. Toeplitz helped Born brush up on his matrix algebra so he <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with the four-dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter's project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics. Born and Minkowski got along well, and their work made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School {{opened a}} new music wing, and Holst {{composed}} St Paul's Suite for the occasion.

For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.|$|E
