5|$|The cost {{increased}} to almost AUÂ£55,000, {{for a variety}} of reasons. It was originally intended for the ship to travel between ports in New Guinea and Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Increasing casualty numbers in the New Guinea campaign meant that the hospitals in Queensland would quickly become unable to deal with the quantity of the casualties and the nature of their injuries, so a longer voyage to Sydney was required. The Army demanded that additional facilities and conversions be added to the original plans such as expanded bathing and washing facilities, hot water made available to all parts of the ship through installation of a <b>calorifier,</b> the rerouting of all steam pipes away from patient areas, and ventilation arrangements suitable for tropical conditions. The unions representing the ship's crew requested improved living and dining conditions, including new sinks in the food preparation areas and the replacement of flooring in the quarters and mess rooms.|$|E
40|$|The colonization, {{survival}} {{and control of}} Legionella pneumophila in a hospital hot-water system was examined. The organism was consistently isolated from <b>calorifier</b> drain-water samples at temperatures of 50 degrees C or below, despite previous chlorination of the system. When the temperature of one of two linked calorifiers was raised to 60 degrees C, by closing off the cold-water feed, the legionella count decreased from c. 10 (4) c. f. u. /l to an undetectable level. However, 10 min after turning on the cold-water feed which produced a fall in <b>calorifier</b> temperature, the count in the <b>calorifier</b> drain water returned to its original level. Investigations revealed that the cold-water supply was continually feeding the calorifiers with L. pneumophila. Simple modifications {{in the design of}} the system were made so that the cold-water feed no longer exceeds 20 degrees C; these measures have considerably reduced the number of L. pneumophila reaching the calorifiers...|$|E
5000|$|Appliances {{that provide}} a [...] supply of hot water are called water heaters, hot water heaters, hot water tanks, boilers, heat exchangers, geysers, or <b>calorifiers.</b> These names depend on region, and whether they heat potable or non-potable water, are in {{domestic}} or industrial use, and their energy source. In domestic installations, potable water heated for uses other than space heating is also called domestic hot water (DHW).|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Contaminated {{washbasin}} taps {{and output}} water {{are an important}} source of bacteria that may cause nosocomial infection. A five-week pretreatment study of hot and cold water from 15 washbasin taps at Dublin Dental Hospital showed consistently heavy contamination by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria: mean bacterial counts of 482. 5 [standard deviation (SD) 293] colony-forming units (cfu) /mL and 5022 (SD 4322) cfu/mL, respectively. AIM: To minimize microbial contamination of washbasin taps and output water in the long term using the electrochemically generated, pH-neutral disinfectant, Ecasol. METHODS: Initially, the 15, 000 -L water tank providing cold and hot water to washbasins, <b>calorifiers</b> and the distribution network were drained and sediment was removed. The system was shock-dosed with Ecasol 100 ppm to eradicate gross contamination and biofilms. Thereafter, tank water was automatically maintained at Ecasol 2. 5 ppm prior to distribution. The microbiological quality of water from five sentinel washbasin taps was monitored weekly for 54 weeks using R 2 A agar. FINDINGS: The mean counts for hot, cold, mains and tank water during the 54 -week study period were 1 (SD 4) cfu/mL, 2 (SD 4) cfu/mL, 205 (SD 160) cfu/mL and 0 cfu/mL, respectively. Swab samples of 33 / 40 taps, each tested on three separate occasions, yielded no growth on R 2 A agar, while five samples yielded 200 cfu/swab. No detrimental effects due to Ecasol were observed in the water network. CONCLUSION: Ecasol consistently minimized bacterial contamination of washbasin taps and output water in a dental hospital setting...|$|R
