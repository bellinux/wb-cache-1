5000|$|Chemical Control - Chemical {{control is}} highly {{recommended}} because downy mildew is an aggressive and destructive disease and satisfactory control {{without the use}} of fungicides is unlikely. Both protectant and systemic products should be applied. Fungicides are most effective when applied prior to infection and reapplied at 5- to 7-day intervals. The following products have proven to be the most effective fungicides in cucumber downy mildew control in North Carolina trials conducted annually from 2004 to 2008: Presidio (fluopicolide, Valent), Ranman (cyazofamid, FMC), Previcur Flex (propamocarb, Bayer), Curzate (<b>cymoxanil,</b> DuPont), Tanos (famoxadone and <b>cymoxanil,</b> DuPont),and Gavel (zoxamide and mancozeb, Dow AgroSciences). These products should be applied in a program to prevent pathogen resistance, that is, rotated with fungicides of a different mode of action. Protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil and mancozeb should be used as mixing partners.|$|E

Hydrolysis of <b>cymoxanil</b> was described by first-order kinetics, which was dependent on pH and temperature. <b>Cymoxanil</b> degraded rapidly at pH 9 (half-life) 31 min) and relatively slowly at pH 2. 8 (half-life) 722 days). The effect of temperature on the rate of <b>cymoxanil</b> degradation was characterized using the Arrhenius equation with an estimated energy of activation of 117. 1 kJ mol- 1. An increase in temperature of 10 °C resulted in a decrease in half-life by a factor of 5. Three competing degradation pathways are proposed for the hydrolysis of <b>cymoxanil,</b> with two of the pathways accounting for 90 % of <b>cymoxanil</b> degradation. These two pathways involved either initial cyclization to 1 -ethyldihydro- 6 -imino- 2, 3, 5 (3 H) -pyrimidinetrione- 5 -(O-methyloxime) (1, Figure 1) or direct cleavage of the C- 1 amide bond to form cyano(methoxyimino) acetic acid (7). The third pathway of degradation involved initial cyclization to 3 -ethyl- 4 -(methoxyimino) - 2, 5 -dioxo- 4 -imidazolidinecarbonitrile (8), which rapidly degrades into 1 -ethyl- 5 -(methoxyimino) - 2, 4 -imidazoline- 2, 4 -dione (9).

Generally, there were both antagonistic, neutral and additive interactions with V. biguttatum among the combinations tested; there were no indications for synergistic interactions. Broad-spectrum fungicides (azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, thiabendazole) were fungitoxic to V. biguttatum as shown in in vitro assays, and hampered black scurf control by V. biguttatum in bio-assays. Oomycete-specific chemicals (<b>cymoxanil</b> and propamocarb) and various biocontrol strains (Gliocladium spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Trichoderma spp.) did {{not interfere with the}} growth of V. biguttatum on agar nutrient plates and did not affect black scurf control by V. biguttatum in co-applied treatments in the minituber bio-assay.

Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to quantify and model the duration of pre- and postinfection activity of fungicides most commonly used for control of hop downy mildew (caused by Pseudoperonospora humuli). In greenhouse experiments, control of downy mildew on leaves was similar among fungicides tested when applied preventatively but varied depending on both the fungicide and the timing of application postinfection. Disease control decreased as applications of copper were made later after inoculation. In contrast, <b>cymoxanil,</b> trifloxystrobin, and dimethomorph reduced disease with similar efficacy when applied 48 h after inoculation compared with preventative applications of these fungicides. When fungicides were applied 72 h after inoculation, only dimethomorph reduced the sporulating leaf area similarly to preinoculation application timing. Adaxial chlorosis, necrosis, and water soaking of inoculated leaves, indicative of infection by P. humuli, were more severe when plants were treated with <b>cymoxanil,</b> trifloxystrobin, and dimethomorph 48 to 72 h after inoculation, even though sporulation was suppressed. Trifloxystrobin and dimethomorph applied 72 h after inoculation suppressed formation of sporangia on sporangiophores as compared with all other treatments. In field studies, dimethomorph, fosetyl-Al, and trifloxystrobin suppressed development of shoots with systemic downy mildew to the greatest extent when applied near the timing of inoculation, although the duration of preventative and postinfection activity varied among the fungicides. There was a small reduction in efficacy of disease control when fosetyl-Al was applied 6 to 7 days after inoculation as compared with protective applications. Trifloxystrobin had 4 to 5 days of preinfection activity and limited postinfection activity. Dimethomorph had the longest duration of protective activity.

For this purpose, a 1 -g GCB reversible extraction cartridge was adopted. Pesticide reextraction {{was performed by}} back-flushing the cartridge with a suitable eluant phase. The advantages of back-flush over forward flush desorption are illustrated. On extracting 2 L of drinking water spiked with the pesticides considered, {{the performance of the}} GCB cartridge was compared to that of a 1 -g C 18 bonded silica cartridge as well as to those of discontinuous and continous liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) techniques. The influence of the presence of humic substances in water {{on the quality of the}} analysis of the pesticides considered was assessed. The limits of quantification (5 times the limit of detection) of this method for the pesticides considered by analyzing municipal waters were below 0. 1 mug/L, except for vamidothion and <b>cymoxanil.</b> Quantitative recoveries of even the most polar pesticides were obtained by submitting to the analysis volumes of ground and surface water samples no greater than 1 and 0. 5 L, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pesticides {{are used}} to control pests and {{diseases}} in modern agriculture but unfortunately their residues {{can be found on}} agricultural crops, and in the human’s dietary. Although the best way to decrease the risk associated with the presence of pesticides on agro-food is following organic farming techniques, most farmers may not avoid the use of chemicals in pest management strategies. A good approach to the problem should therefore guarantee good agricultural yields and low pesticide residues allowing the use of environmental safety pesticides on crops, so joining consumer’s safeness with farmer’s necessity. Results: The behaviour of various pesticides used in IPM strategies on grapes and tomatoes were studied. All the analytical methods showed good recoveries, and good separation of the molecules. Repeatability and intermediate precision showed good results, and LODs and LOQs were far below the MRLs set by EU for these pesticides in tomatoes and grapes. The analysis of pesticide residues on tomatoes showed that cv. with little berries accounted for higher residue levels than cv. with big berries. They also showed an high persistence of azoxystrobin, cyproconazole, cyprodinil, penconazole, tolclofos-methyl, mepanipyrim, pyrimethanil, famoxadone fenamidone, fenhexamid, iprodione, and a rapid degradation of triadimenol, <b>cymoxanil,</b> iprovalicarb, fenarimol, and fludioxonil. On grapes, the behaviour in field and the transfer to wine during winemaking of iprovalicarb, indoxacarb, and boscalid, was studied. The residue levels found in grapes were far below the MRLs set for grapes in EU, accounting at harvest time 0. 81, 0. 43, and 4. 23 mg/kg for iprovalicarb, indoxacarb, and boscalid, respectively. The residue levels in the samples treated with boscalid may have residual problems (due to an accumulation effect) if repeated field treatments will be performed. Winemaking experiments showed a complete transfer of all pesticide from grapes to the must, while in wine the residues were low or negligible due to the adsorbing effect of lees and pomace. The clarification experiments showed a good removal of pesticide residues from the wine media, for all pesticides. The data obtained in two years survey of pesticide residues on wines following IPM strategies, showed residues less than maximum residue limits (MRLs). The most pesticides present a residue absent, some (benalaxyl, metalaxyl, iprovalicarb, penconazole, <b>cymoxanil</b> and thiophanate-metyl) showed a residual below the minimum limit of detection (LOD). No residues were found above the LOQ (0, 01 mg/kg). Conclusions: The obtained data showed the possibility to get tomatoes and wine at "zero residue" or, at least, with residues below the limit of quantification (LOQ). The data collected on tomato have also shown the difference in initial deposition of pesticide joined {{to the size of the}} berries in order to obtain products with lower pesticide residues, paying more attention to chemical treatments for the defense of cultivars with small berries. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{one-step}} microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) {{procedure for}} highly efficient multiresidue extraction of seven fungicides (<b>cymoxanil,</b> metalaxyl, mandipropamid, folpet, chlorothalonil, kresoxim-methyl and famoxadone) in soil was developed. The trace residue {{levels in the}} soil were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with variable wavelength detection (VWD). Parameters affecting the MAE process such as the type and volume of the extraction solvent, irradiation power, temperature, irradiation time, moisture and salt addition were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, extraction efficiencies {{in the range of}} 72. 4 - 99. 4 % were obtained for all the fungicides studied. The method was linear over the range of 0. 01 - 10 mu g g(- 1) with correlation coefficients (r(2)) between 0. 9989 and 0. 9999. LODs (S/N = 3) and LOQs (S/N = 10) obtained varied from 0. 0006 to 0. 0015 mu g g(- 1) and from 0. 002 to 0. 005 mu g g(- 1), respectively. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the analysis of real soil samples and acceptable recoveries from 57. 5 to 122 % with RSDs <= 14 % were obtained. The overall results have been compared with Soxhlet, shake-flask and ultrasonic solvent extraction techniques. Thus, the developed method could be efficiently used for selective extraction and determination of the target analytes from complex soil matrices...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a field-study of real pesticide application conditions in a vineyard. The {{objective was to}} measure the exposure, the transfer {{and the effects of}} pesticides on a non-target soil invertebrate, the land snail Helix aspersa. There was no drift of the herbicides (glyphosate and glufosinate) whereas the fungicides (<b>cymoxanil,</b> folpet, tebuconazole and pyraclostrobin) were detected up to 20 m from the treated area. For folpet and particularly tebuconazole, spray deposits on soil (corresponding to losses for the intended target i. e. the vine leaves) were high (41. 1 % and 88. 8 % loss of applied dose, respectively). For herbicides, the target was the soil and losses (percentage of compounds which did not reach the soil) were of 22 % for glufosinate and 52 % for glyphosate. In the study plot, glyphosate was transferred to and accumulated in snail tissues (4 mg kg− 1 dry weight, dw), as was its metabolite AMPA (8 mg kg− 1 dw) which could be in relation with the reduced growth observed in snails. No effects on snail survival or growth were found after exposure to the other organic compounds or to copper and sulphur-fungicides, although transfer of tebuconazole, pyraclostrobin and copper occurred. This study brings original field data on the fate of pesticides in a vineyard agro-ecosystem under real conditions of application and shows that transfer and effects of pesticides to a non-target organism occurred...|$|E
40|$|BiomassBed is an {{indirect}} {{system designed to}} collect accidental pesticide spills as well as water remnants of tank sprayers. This system was installed in a vineyard and tested in bio-cleaning water that was contaminated by fungicides in a two-year-field experiment. At {{the end of each}} treatment, wastewater of sprayer tanks containing mixtures of <b>cymoxanil,</b> dimethomorph, metalaxyl M, folpet, penconazole, cyprodinil, fludioxonil, azoxystrobin, mandipropamid, pyraclostrobin at different concentrations were discharged into the BiomassBed and repeatedly circulated through an organic biofilter of pruning residues and straw for fungicide adsorption and biodegradation. Water collected was sampled and analysed for fungicide residues, and organic biofilter was analysed to assess fungicide dissipation. Fungicides were removed from water in a range of 92. 4 – 100 % of the initial concentration. Metalaxyl M was the least retained and probably desorbed during recirculation of water. However, metalaxyl M residues dissipated in 70 days in collected stagnant water. Abiotic and biotic factors contributing to the disappearance of metalaxyl M in water was hypothesised. Fungicide dissipation in the organic biofilter occurred in a 90 -day period with the exception of penconazole that remained at 63. 6 % and 42. 0 % in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Owing to the advantageous combination of depuration and bio-degradation processes, fungicides were removed from water in a range of 92. 4 to 100 %. However more effort is needed to enhance adsorption of mobile fungicides and to achieve a faster degradation of more persistent active ingredients...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} fungicide sensitivity of progeny of Phytophthora infestans at the University of Wales, Bangor. Sexual progeny {{were derived from}} an A 2 parent that was Metalaxyl Sensitive (MS) with three A 1 parents that were: MS, MS and MR (metalaxyl resistant). Sporangial and zoosporangial progeny from the parent and from some sexual progeny were also assessed. The different isolates were grown on Rye B Agar amended with different concentrations of one of five different fungicides: Metalaxyl, Propamocarb hydrochloride, <b>Cymoxanil,</b> Fluazinam and Azoxystrobin. The results indicated that in metalaxyl, the sensitivity of sporangial progeny {{was similar to that}} of the parent isolates, however that of zoosporangial progeny ranged from being Intermediate (MI) to being Resistant (MR) if the parents were Resistant (MR) or from Sensitive (MS) to being Intermediate (MI) if the parents were Sensitive (MS). No resistance was observed among progeny that were exposed to Azoxystrobin. With the other fungicides, there was a variation in the sensitivity of sporangial and zoosporangial progeny e. g. some sensitive sporangia gave rise to highly resistant zoospores. The results showed that resistance to the most commonly used fungicides against late blight is possible. Although no resistance to the new fungicide azoxystrobin was observed, the appearance of resistance to it among other fungal pathogens has been reported. Therefore, breeders are faced with a challenge of coming up with cultivars with reduced susceptibility to late blight and plant pathologists are to come up with a wide range of fungicides so that their use can be rotated to avoid build-up of resistance isolates...|$|E
40|$|The climatic {{conditions}} in Northern and Western (NW) Europe, {{which are very}} suitable for the cultivation of potatoes, are also very favourable {{for a range of}} diseases of which late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, {{is by far the most}} important with the potential to cause total crop loss. It is controlled by foliar fungicides, with up to 15 – 20 sprays being used per season. A wide range of fungicides is approved for the control of late blight including nonsystemics (e. g. mancozeb, fluazinam), numerous translaminar compounds (e. g. <b>cymoxanil,</b> dimethomorph, mandipropamid) but few fully systemic fungicides (viz. the phenylamides including metalaxyl-M, and propamocarb hydrochloride). Resistance to metalaxyl appeared in 1980, within a few years of its introduction, and led to control failures in Ireland and the Netherlands. Subsequently, anti-resistance management strategies were developed which allowed continuing use of phenylamides only in mixtures with nonsystemic multisite-inhibiting fungicides and with a limited number of applications. Resistance to other fungicides used to control late blight or early blight (caused by Alternaria spp.) has not developed or has not led to major reductions in control, perhaps in part as a consequence of effective resistance management. The potato is also susceptible to many tuber pathogens, which can cause rots and blemishes and are frequently transmitted via the seed tuber. Relatively few fungicides are approved for tuber or soil application to control tuber diseases. Resistance to thiabendazole, first used on potatoes in the 1970 s, developed in several pathogens and resulted in loss of control where it was used alone. Resistance management has focused on avoiding repeated use of thiabendazole during multiple generations of the potato crop and use in mixtures with imazalil. In Europe, resistance has not developed to other fungicides used to control tuber diseases, although pathogen strains resistant to fludioxonil have been reported elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFate {{and effects}} of {{pesticides}} in agrosystem were studied using a non target species living at the interface soil-plant-air, the landsnail Helix aspersa. Fate in and effects on snails of 8 commercial herbicide and fungicide formulations (Roundup® and Bypass® = glyphosate; Basta® = glufosinate; Valiant® Flash = folpet + <b>cymoxanil</b> + fosetyl-Al; Corail® = tebuconazole; Cabrio® Top = pyraclostrobin + metiram-Zn; Thiovit® = sulphur; Bordeaux mixture = copper salts) commonly employed in vineyards were studied {{in the field and}} for some of them, in laboratory experiments. Here we present a synthesis of a four-years program that aims to develop various biological methods for in situ biomonitoring and life cycle exposure under controlled conditions. A field study in real conditions of pesticide application revealed few effects on the survival and growth of juvenile snails exposed in microcosms to each different treatment. Glyphosate (4 mg kg- 1) and AMPA (8 mg kg- 1) were detected in snail tissues. The transfer of pyraclostrobin and tebuconazole was also demonstrated. Internal concentrations were low but however higher than LMR drawn for animal products. The effects of two herbicides, Bypass® and Basta® were studied on the whole life cycle of snails in laboratory conditions. No toxicity was found on survival and growth although an accumulation of glyphosate was revealed in snails (6 mg kg- 1) exposed continuously to contaminated food (30 mg kg- 1). Bioassays for embryotoxicity testing of chemicals in solution or in the soil showed that all pesticides inhibited egg hatching success at lower concentrations than those applied in the field and the influence of soil characteristics on the toxicity of the pesticides was demonstrated. As bioassays using eggs are considered as in vitro methods, efforts should be given to improve and promote the use of such method. This work led to the proposal of complementary tools available for pesticide risk assessment in terrestrial environment. Analytical difficulties were encountered and {{it was not possible to}} finalize the analytical methods for all substances studied. Thus, the determination of pesticide residues in animal tissues still represents an essential challenge for current environmental concerns...|$|E
