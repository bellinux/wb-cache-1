In August 2015, the NCAA {{and a group of}} ten conferences jointly campaigned against daily fantasy games featuring <b>college</b> <b>sports,</b> asserting that DFS is inconsistent with the NCAA's policies and values. The SEC had discussions with its broadcast partners in an attempt to discourage the advertising of daily fantasy games during its telecasts, while both Big Ten Network and Pac-12 Network prohibited advertising for daily fantasy games involving <b>college</b> <b>sports.</b> On December 9, 2015, it was reported that ESPN had similarly agreed not to air advertising for daily fantasy services during telecasts of the College Football Playoff. On March 31, 2016, DraftKings and FanDuel jointly agreed to stop offering daily fantasy <b>college</b> <b>sports</b> following the conclusion of the 2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the role that race and ethnicity plays in the experiences for people of Asian descent in professional positions in American <b>college</b> <b>sport.</b> Specifically, this study sought to understand (a) the reasons for the underrepresentation of people of Asian descent in professional positions, (b) the ways that race and racism play a role in the underrepresentation for people of Asian descent in professional positions, and (c) the strategies employed for obtaining and maintaining a professional position for people of Asian descent in American <b>college</b> <b>sport.</b> This basic interpretive qualitative research was conducted utilizing in-depth semi-structured interviews. The participants of the study consisted of six (N= 6) professionals of Asian descent that are currently working or have worked in American <b>college</b> <b>sport.</b> Asian critical theory was utilized to guide and establish research questions, method, interpretation of findings, discussion, and conclusion. Five themes emerged from the data:(a) Asian cultural value of education over sport/athletic participation (i. e., family influence and educational competitiveness in an Asian country); (b) incongruousness of the term ?Asians? with sport; (c) language barriers (i. e., lack of communication skills and limited network); (d) exclusion due to race-based view of foreigner; and (e) commonly accepted job practices (i. e., persistence and building a network). As an initial study on people of Asian descent in American <b>college</b> <b>sport,</b> the findings could benefit practitioners in American <b>college</b> <b>sport</b> to understand the current experiences for people of Asian descent face and educate people of Asian descent as to how they succeed in American <b>college</b> <b>sport.</b> In addition, this study would make a contribution to literature in the sport context by providing experiential knowledge of people of Asian descent in American <b>college</b> <b>sport...</b>|$|R

5|$|A quadruple-double {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a double digit number total in four of five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—in a game. This feat is extremely rare: only four players have officially recorded a quadruple-double in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. The first American male player above the high school level to officially record a quadruple-double was Nate Thurmond, who achieved this feat in 1974 while playing for the NBA's Chicago Bulls. The first American female player above the high school level to officially record a quadruple-double was Ann Meyers, who achieved this feat in 1978 while playing for the UCLA Bruins, when women's <b>college</b> <b>sports</b> were {{under the auspices of the}} AIAW. The first male player in NCAA Division I history to record a quadruple-double was Lester Hudson in 2007. The first Division I women's player to have officially recorded a quadruple-double since the NCAA began sponsoring women's sports in 1981–82 was Veronica Pettry of Loyola of Chicago in 1989; only two other women have done so since, and none since 1993. An earlier player, Jackie Spencer of Louisville, accomplished the feat against Cincinnati during the 1984–85 season, but the NCAA did not record assists and steals throughout Division I women's basketball at that time. The Metro Conference, then home to both schools, did officially record these statistics, but the NCAA did not start doing so until 1985–86 for assists and 1987–88 for steals.|$|E
