500|$|When Simone {{returned}} to the United States, she learned that a warrant had been issued for her arrest for unpaid taxes (as a protest against her country's involvement with the Vietnam War), and {{returned to}} Barbados to evade the authorities and prosecution. Simone stayed in Barbados {{for quite some time}} and she had a lengthy affair with the Prime Minister, Errol Barrow. A close friend, singer Miriam Makeba, then persuaded her to go to Liberia. Later, she lived in Switzerland and the Netherlands, before settling in France in 1993. During a 1998 performance in Newark, she announced, [...] "If you're going to <b>come</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> again, you've got to come to France, because I ain't coming back." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Misery" [...] {{details the}} {{feelings}} one receives following a new relationship. Stefani sings: [...] "Hurry up, <b>come</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> / Put {{me out of}} my misery", which shows the singer debating whether she wants to relive the pain or experience the pleasure. Elsewhere, she compares her boyfriend to medications: [...] "You're like drugs to me / You're like drugs to me", and warns him that their newfound relationship is becoming a bit much: [...] "You're in so much trouble / Yeah, you're in so much trouble". Additionally, she requests that the lover should come visit her: [...] "You're at the door / I'm thinking things I never thought before / Like what your love would taste like / Give me more". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that Stefani's ex-husband Gavin Rossdale was not the track's subject, despite the misleading use of the word [...] "Misery".|$|E
500|$|Polizzotti, in {{his study}} of Highway 61 Revisited, writes that the opening track of Side Two, [...] "Queen Jane Approximately" [...] is in a similar vein to [...] "Like a Rolling Stone", but the song offers [...] "a touch of sympathy and even comfort in place of {{relentless}} mockery". The song is structured as a series of ABAB quatrain verses, with each verse followed by a chorus that is simply a repeat of the last line of each verse: [...] "Won't you <b>come</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> Queen Jane?". Gill calls this song [...] "the least interesting track" [...] on Highway 61, but praises the piano ascending the scale during the harmonica break as an evocation of [...] "the stifling nature of an upper class existence". Others have speculated that the song is directed at Joan Baez and the folk movement, which Dylan had largely left behind. [...] "Queen Jane Approximately" [...] was released as the B-side of Dylan's [...] "One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)" [...] single in early 1966.|$|E

500|$|Elliott {{was known}} as [...] "a coach's AD." [...] "He hired coaches he trusted, then gave them the resources, {{latitude}} and support they needed to operate as they saw fit – providing they played by the rules." [...] Iowa wrestling coach Dan Gable said his wife cried on learning that Elliott had retired. [...] In 1999, Gable wrote: [...] "Right after I came to coach at the University of Iowa, I {{had a meeting with}} Bump Elliott, who was the Athletic Director. I’ll never forget what Bump said to me: ‘Don’t ask for the moon. Strive to get there, sure, but do it wisely through continuing to build upon what you already have. As you build, <b>come</b> <b>see</b> <b>me,</b> and we’ll see how I can help you out.’ I now call that bit of wisdom the Bump Elliott Rule, and it serves a good reminder to keep things in perspective. Gradual, solid growth is better than any quick fix.""The one thing we emphasized from the start was that our staff had to make sure we were 100 percent loyal to each other and the university," [...] Elliott said {{at the time of his}} retirement. [...] "There could be no jealousy between the coaches and various programs. [...] I wanted no one talking behind anyone's backs. [...] I wanted absolute loyalty. [...] If not, then that person could leave any time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oakland {{native and}} NBA legend Gary Payton, in his {{trademark}} competitive, trash-talking style, went around Oakland {{with a video}} camera to rebuke some of Barkley's comments and {{get some of the}} locals' opinions on Barkley and his comments, with Payton providing some of his own comments about [...] "Sir Charles" [...] and providing quips such as [...] "It ain't no thrift store, it's Oakland". [...] The humorous segment, which also included embarrassing vintage coverage of Barkley being dunked on in a game against Golden State, aired during Inside the NBAs playoff coverage of the series between the Warriors and the Utah Jazz. The clip culminated with a shot of Payton {{standing in front of the}} San Francisco Bay saying [...] "How do you feel about my city now, Chuck? ... Now, <b>come</b> <b>see</b> <b>me,</b> in person, here. [...] I've got a surprise for you, too, a lot of Krispy Kreme donuts." [...] The humorous controversy was subsequently put to rest.|$|E

We use only the finest of rootlets, strips of soft bark, fibers of plants, the brown cotton that grows on ferns, and perhaps a little hair when we can find it. We make a dainty nest, if I do say it, and we fasten it securely in the fork made by two or three upright little branches.

50|$|Eroge visual novels, such as Popotan, {{frequently}} receive fan discs. Since most visual novels depict standalone stories, rarely warranting sequels, {{this particular}} genre notoriously employs fan discs {{as a medium}} to explore pre-established settings and profit from the original game's popularity. Sometimes, a fan disc is made as a compilation of the two separate, but similar games, aiming {{to serve as a}} link between them (the <b>Come</b> <b>See</b> <b>Me</b> Tonight series being an example).|$|E

50|$|It {{was slow}} going in Canada when my album was first released. It had sold around 12,000 copies. I {{remember}} sitting dolefully in the Capitol offices in Toronto with Deane Cameron (then {{the head of}} A&R at Capitol Canada) and him making an urgent phone call to EMI in Los Angeles. He was pushing and pleading for a rep of the US label to <b>come</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> perform live. At that time, the Canadian industry needed US validation before really giving the homegrown domestic talent their full enthusiastic support. It was frustrating for many Canadian artists who couldn’t land a deal south of the border.|$|E
