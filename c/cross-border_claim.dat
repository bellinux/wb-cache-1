40|$|This paper {{documents}} the changing international exposures of U. S. bank balance sheets since the mid- 1980 s. U.

In recent years some <b>cross-border</b> <b>claims</b> on Latin American countries have declined, while claims extended locally by the branches and subsidiaries of U. S. banks have grown. The foreign exposures of larger U. S. banks tend to be less volatile than claims of smaller banks, and locally-issued claims tend to be more stable than cross-border flows. Business cycle variables have mixed influence on U. S. bank <b>cross-border</b> and local <b>claims.</b> The <b>cross-border</b> <b>claims</b> of U.

Using data on U. S., Spanish, and Italian banks'foreign claims across countries, the authors find that the share of local foreign claims is primarily driven by the degree of"freedom"in the host banking sector and by business opportunities in the local market. Entry requirements, startup and informational costs associated with international banking also play a role, but their influence is less robust. Finally, they find that the mix of international bank claims has implications for financial stability, since foreign claim volatility is lower in countries that receive {{a larger share of}} local claims.

It is, however, in the international monetary arena that the notion of multipolarity - more than two dominant poles - commands renewed attention and vigorous debate. For much of its history, the quintessential structural feature of the international monetary system has been unipolarity - as American hegemony of initiatives and power as well as its capacity to promote a market-based, liberal order came to define and shape international monetary relations. As other currencies become potential substitutes for the US dollar in international reserves and in <b>cross-border</b> <b>claims,</b> exchange rate volatility may become more severe.

40|$|Tracking {{international}} bank flows 1 Activity in {{the international}} banking market has grown in recent years, both in absolute terms and relative to aggregate measures of economic activity and liquidity. By establishing a global outreach, several international banking centres have become key players in this market. This feature shows how the BIS international banking statistics {{can be used to}} track the net flow of capital through the global banking system, with a focus on the role of banks in the United Kingdom and Caribbean and Asian offshore centres. JEL classification: F 34, G 15, G 21. The international banking market is a primary conduit through which funds are transferred between countries. Since 2002, cross-border lending and deposits have risen, both in absolute terms and relative to aggregate measures of real economic activity and liquidity. The structure of the international banking market has evolved over the past 30 years. While London has remained a primary financial centre, Asian and Caribbean offshore centres have expanded their global presence, and are important in the channelling of funds between countries. This feature uses the BIS international banking statistics to quantify these developments. The first section places into perspective the growth in international banking activity in recent years, while the following section analyses the importance of international banking centres. The final section provides a convenient graphical representation {{of the structure of the}} international banking market, and analyses the net flow of bank credit between ultimate lenders and borrowers.

Its construction will:#:: (A) Improve access to financing for all businesses across Europe and investment projects, in particular start-ups, SMEs and long-term projects.#:: (B) Increase and diversify the sources of funding from investors in the EU and all over the world, so that companies (including SMEs) in addition to the already available bank credit lending also can tap capital markets through alternative funding sources that better suits them.#:: (C) Make the capital markets work more effectively by connecting investors and those who need funding more efficiently, both within Member States and cross-border.#:: (D) Make the capital markets more shock resilient by pooling cross-border private risk-sharing through a deepening integration of bond and equity markets, herby also protecting it better against the risk for systemic shocks in the national financial sector.#: The establishment of the CMU, is envisaged {{at the same time to}} require a strengthening of the available tools to manage systemic risks of financial players prudently (macro-prudential toolkit), and a strengthening of the supervisory framework for financial actors to ensure their solidity and that they have sufficient risk management structures in place (ultimately leading to the launch of a new single European capital markets supervisor). A harmonized taxation scheme for capital market activities, could also play an important role in terms of providing a neutral treatment for different but comparable activities and investments across jurisdictions.

40|$|Cross-border {{bank lending}} during the taper tantrum: {{the role of}} {{emerging}} market fundamentals 1 Cross-border bank lending to emerging markets slowed sharply during the taper tantrum.

In other words, the issue of intermediaries too systemic to fail (TSTF) has nowadays replaced the old problem of too big to fail. To this aim, we build several core-periphery networks and we compute several structural indicators suitable to capture various aspects related to the interconnection, such as average degree and density, clustering coefficient and assortativity coefficient. In general, the structural properties and dynamics of the network of cross-country financial links are crucial to understand the reaction of the system to the shocks. A greater stability is observed for core-core networks, while indicators computed on core-periphery structure are more affected over time...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the private enforcement of EU competition law and forum shopping with a particular focus on cross-border collective end-consumer redress. There is no coherent framework across the EU for these types of cases. This lack of uniformity has the potential to create recourse to different national courts. Lawyers may engage in forum shopping when filing lawsuits on behalf of the victims of mass torts. Such practices can provide Member States with incentives to amend their laws to attract collective proceedings and create competition between national judicial systems. However, forum shopping is not the only concern. There appears to be a paucity of <b>cross-border</b> collective <b>claims.</b> This is coupled with an apparent lack of motivation for end-consumers to seek a remedy, particularly if the only choice is to litigate outside their own legal regime. Addressing this situation is vital given that end-consumers regularly suffer harm in the form of higher prices, lower output, reduced quality and limited innovation as a result of antitrust infringements but they are rarely compensated due to legal and practical obstacles. To each end-consumer the harm may indeed be de minimis. However, the aggregate harm can amount to a considerable sum. In the absence of effective redress procedures, infringing undertakings retain the spoils of their unlawful conduct. Against this background, this thesis {{examines the}} extent to which the conflicts-of-laws rules encourage forum shopping and considers the appropriate forum and the appropriate procedural measures that need to be adopted in order to facilitate effective and equal access to justice for end-consumer victims of EU competition law violations...|$|R
40|$|The fast {{innovations}} existent {{on financial}} {{markets and the}} internationalization of cash-flows {{in the last decade}} led to changes within the banking industry making it unrecognized. The financial innovation within the banking industry, especially the one regarding the off-balance-sheet instruments has effects as the risk focus and the increase of volatility within the entire banking industry. As it is proved by the economic crisis, the financial stability plays an important role within the financial system as well as within the economy as a whole. At the moment, as the number of active financial institutions is getting higher and higher in one or more countries or on one or more continents, the financial stability at a worldwide level became even more important. The objective of this work is to emphasize {{the way in which the}} European banks were affected once with the global financial crisis. The economic crisis was triggered by the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers â€˜ Investment Bank, in the autumn of 2008 and its effects were felt at the level of the European financial markets, a series of <b>cross-border</b> groups <b>claiming</b> interventions of the state in order for them to be saved. The intensity of the crisis was felt and it affected many states, the impact of these ones being influenced by a series of specific factors which outlined the situation of their financial system, at the moment of the crisis release. At the level of the European Union, a series of measures have been established in order to extinguish the identified dysfunctions at a financial field level, among which we mention: the improvement of the surveillance framework of those financial institutions having cross-border activity, the expansion of the communication and cooperation among the EU surveillance authorities and the ones outside the Union, etc. The conclusions of the study of this paper work in regards to the activity of the main European banks, especially to the ones from Western Europe, is the fact that during the crisis period, they intensified their cross-border activities and increased their incomes. The increase of incomes was generated by both the fast efficient measures taken by the state and the volatility of the emergent markets. All these aspects were detailed in the content of this paper work. As far as this work is concerned, the method used here consist in a deductive-type research, which means that the starting point is represented by general facts in order to get to particular ones, starting from a theory that has as purpose the application of that certain prediction, assuring a wider knowledge area and being more operational.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{cross-border}} consumer transactions in the EU {{is growing at}} a rapid pace: the number of EU consumers entering into such transactions doubled over the decade 2002 - 12. Particularly significant growth is visible with regard to online cross-border transactions, {{with the number of}} EU consumers engaging in these having grown six times in the same period. However, the individual value of such transactions remains relatively small, with almost half of them falling below the threshold of € 100. Just {{as in the case of}} domestic transactions, cross-border bargains too do not always end with the outcome desired by both parties, with a dispute the result. If these cannot be resolved amicably, the creditor has the choice either to pursue the case in court, or to give up the claim. However, the costs and burdens of ordinary civil procedures often act as a deterrent to pursuing claims. Therefore, most EU Member States have introduced some form of simplified track for small claims. These procedures, often successful with regard to domestic litigation, are not, as a rule, well adapted for crossborder disputes. With the aim of overcoming this gap, the EU legislature adopted a European Small Claims Procedure (ESCP) in 2007. The ESCP is a simplified and accelerated civil procedure, available only in <b>cross-border</b> cases, for <b>claims</b> up to € 2 000. It is an optional procedure, in that it does not replace similar national procedures. Whereas the Regulation covers several aspects of the procedure, in particular the standard forms to be used by parties, deadlines imposed upon the court and parties, rules on the written phase of proceedings, as well as minimum standards for review of the judgment, many other key aspects have been left to national law. This applies in particular to the jurisdiction of courts, court fees, detailed rules of evidence law, rules on appeals and finally details of the enforcement procedure. Despite its potential to facilitate cross-border enforcement of small debts in the EU, the Regulation has not been a major success in practice. The limited statistical data available indicates that very few cases are being filed, with an average of approximately 100 per Member State each year. Various reasons for this have been identified, in particular lack of knowledge about the procedure among citizens and judges, the high costs of translation, the absence of clear rules on the service of judgments, and the fact that rules on enforcement proceedings have not been unified, but are left to the Member States. In 2013, the Commission put forward a proposal for amending the ESCP Regulation with a view to increasing its attractiveness. Four key issues have been addressed. Firstly, the threshold of a 'small' claim would be raised from € 2 000 to € 10 000. Secondly, expanding the notion of a 'cross-border' claim would be considerably liberalised. Thirdly, there would be a maximum cap on court fees set at 10 % of the value of the claim. Finally, the use of means of distant communication would become obligatory when parties are domiciled in different Member States. Nevertheless, a number of key aspects of the ESCP would continue to be regulated by domestic civil procedure, in particular the jurisdiction of courts within a Member State, the language of proceedings, admissibility and forms of appeal, rules on evidence and on computation of time, and rules concerning enforcement proceedings...|$|R
40|$|I. 1 Motivation Exchange {{rates are}} a key issue in {{international}} economics and politics. While the determinants of exchange rates have been extensively studied in previous works, this dissertation {{contributes to the literature}} by deriving exchange rate expectations from stock market (ADR) data and analyzing their determinants. This exercise is done for three cases where one has to resort to exchange rate expectations since the national exchange rate is either manipulated by the central bank (the first paper in Chapter II), fixed in pegged exchange rate regimes (the second paper in Chapter III), or not existent as the considered country is part of a currency union and therefore has no national currency (the third paper in Chapter IV). The first paper presented in Chapter II analyzes exchange rate expectations for the case of China in the period 1998 - 2009 in order to test standard exchange rate theories. American officials repeatedly accused China of systematically undervaluing its currency against the U. S. dollar, which produces political tensions between both countries. A recent climax in this dispute was reached on September 28, 2010, when the House of Representatives passed the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, which would allow the imposition of import duties for countries with undervalued currencies, namely China. Although this bill did not pass the Senate, Chinese officials clearly opposed the bill arguing against significant undervaluation of the yuan and in favor of political opportunism of U. S. officials. As the assessments of a fair exchange rate significantly differ among officials of both countries, the Chinese-American exchange rate dispute continues. Measuring the development of market determined exchange rate expectations may help to find a compromise in this international political dispute and knowing the determinants of these expectations may help to identify macroeconomic policies necessary to influence future exchange rates. The second paper presented in Chapter III investigates the development of exchange rate expectations and their determinants for the currency crisis episodes in Argentina (2001 - 2002), Malaysia (1998 - 1999), and Venezuela (1994 - 1996 and 2003 - 2007). Large devaluations of Southeast Asian and Latin American currencies were to be observed during the currency crises in the 1990 ’s and {{at the beginning of the}} last decade. Due to an appreciation of foreign currency denominated debt, capital withdrawals, and bank runs, for example, currency crises typically lead to significant output losses in the affected economies (Hutchison and Noy, 2002). Avoiding currency crisis outbreaks has therefore become one of the major policy goals in many developing countries, which may explain the rapid accumulation of foreign exchange reserves aimed to fend off speculative attacks in these countries. The costs of this currency crisis prevention policy are however often overseen. Since foreign exchange reserves are typically invested in U. S. Treasuries, they yield a relatively low return compared to the high cost of domestic capital in these countries. Moreover, foreign exchange reserves may lose in value as the domestic currency appreciates against the U. S. dollar (Rodrik, 2006). An alternative way to avoid the outbreak of currency crises may be to regularly adjust the official exchange rate (typically managed by the domestic central bank) to levels in line with market expectations. Knowing market-based exchange rate expectations and their determinants may therefore be a cheaper way to avoid currency crises than holding excess amounts of foreign exchange reserves. The third paper presented in Chapter IV uses daily ADR data to analyze the determinants of the risk of withdrawals from the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) for the five vulnerable member countries Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain for the period 2007 - 2009. The subprime lending crisis has triggered significant financial turmoil in the EMU. Banking systems were destabilized and the governments of Greece, Ireland, and Portugal had to be bailed out. Reasserting national authority over monetary policy may help domestic policymakers to address the problems caused by banking and sovereign debt crises or an overvalued euro at national discretion. While the abandonment of fixed exchange rate regimes has so far been analyzed for countries with national currencies, the financial vulnerabilities in the EMU offer a new case to study the possibility of withdrawals from a monetary union. Although a country’s membership in the EMU is typically considered irreversible, many authors agree that sovereign states can choose to leave the EMU (Cohen, 1993; Scott, 1998; Buiter, 1999; Eichengreen, 2007). The new Treaty of Lisbon now includes a provision outlining voluntary withdrawal from the Union, which may cause the members to re-think the pros and cons of remaining in the EMU. Although the European Central Bank (ECB) has implemented measures meant to support the banking sectors and governments in the EMU, autonomous national central banks would probably pursue more expansionary monetary policies. By analyzing the determinants of exchange rate expectations in the monetary union one may therefore analyze the drivers of the risk of withdrawal from the EMU. I. 2 Deriving exchange rate expectations from prices of American Depositary Receipts Measuring movements in exchange rate expectations is a relatively easy task for currencies in which a liquid and free forward exchange market exists. For the cases considered in this dissertation, however, the forward exchange market either produces bad forecasts or does not even exist. For the case of China, the yuan/U. S. dollar forward exchange rate is most likely managed by the Chinese central bank in the course of its foreign exchange market intervention policies, which hampers its ability to provide good signals for the future spot market exchange rate (see, for example, Wang, 2010). For the considered member countries of the EMU, no national currencies exist and consequently forward exchange rates cannot be used. For the case of the currency crisis episodes studied in this dissertation, one could use regression-based forecasting models that employ data on macroeconomic variables in order to produce currency crisis signals (see, among others, Eichengreen et al., 1995; Frankel and Rose, 1996; Kaminsky et al., 1998; Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999; Karmann et al., 2002). The drawback of these approaches is the nature of macroeconomic data used, which enables one to create only monthly or quarterly crisis signals based on backward-looking data. In this dissertation I use stock market data to derive exchange rate expectations, which has several advantages compared to existing approaches. First of all, the prices of the considered stocks are most probably not manipulated by central bank interventions since these stocks are traded in the United States, which enables the derivation of exchange rate expectations formed under free market conditions (also for China). The used stock market data is available for the considered EMU member countries, which facilitates the analysis of the risk of withdrawals from the EMU. Moreover, stock market data is forward-looking and available on a daily basis, which enables the derivation of more accurate and up-to-date currency crisis signals for the considered crisis episodes. In order to derive exchange rate expectations I use data on a particular type of stock called American Depositary Receipt (ADR). An ADR is a financial instrument for foreign companies to list their shares at stock exchanges in the Unites States. An ADR represents the ownership of a specific number of underlying shares of a company in the home market on which the ADR is written. While the underlying stock is denominated in the currency and traded at the stock exchange of the home market, the ADR is denominated in U. S. dollars and traded at a U. S. stock exchange. Since both types of stocks of the same company generate identical cash flows and incorporate equivalent rights and dividend <b>claims,</b> <b>cross-border</b> arbitrage implies that the ADR and its underlying stock have the same price when adjusted for the current exchange rate. When capital controls or ownership restrictions are implemented, cross-border arbitrage is not possible and the law of one price is not binding. In such an environment, information efficiency suggests that the relative prices of ADRs and their underlying stocks – which only differ with respect to the currency they are denominated in – will signal exchange rate expectations of stock market investors. Using data on relative prices (or returns) of ADRs and their underlying stocks and the current exchange rate I can calculate measures for exchange rate expectations of stock market investors. Although the papers presented in this dissertation differ with respect to the considered companies, countries, and time periods, each paper uses the same kind of data and a similar methodology to derive exchange rate expectations – relative prices or returns of ADRs and their corresponding underlying stocks. In each paper I use a panel regression framework in order to analyze the determinants of exchange rate expectations. Each of the included papers focuses on a distinct facet of exchange rate expectations. The first paper focuses on standard exchange rate theories such as the relative purchasing power parity or the uncovered interest rate parity in order to analyze the factors that drive exchange rate expectations in general. The second paper studies the determinants of currency crisis expectations. The third paper analyzes the determinants of the risk of withdrawals from the EMU as expected by ADR market investors. I. 3 Contribution to the literature This dissertation adds to two strands of the literature. First, it contributes to a literature that studies the determinants of exchange rates,|$|R
