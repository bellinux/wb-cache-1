50|$|A needlecase or needle {{case is a}} small, often decorative, holder for sewing needles. Early needlecases {{were usually}} small tubular {{containers}} of bone, wood, or bronze with tight-fitting stoppers, often designed to hang from a belt. Needlecases are sometimes called by the French name étui and are typically one of the tools attached to a chatelaine. A pin poppet is a similar <b>container</b> <b>for</b> <b>pins,</b> common in the 18th century.|$|E

5000|$|The Equipment Leasing {{engages in}} leasing and {{disposing}} containers and chassis. Basically, {{there are five}} types of equipment for leasing, including Dry Freight <b>Containers</b> (<b>for</b> general cargo), Refrigerated <b>Containers</b> (<b>for</b> perishable items), Special Containers (Open Tops and Flat Racks, for heavy and oversized cargo), Tank <b>Containers</b> (<b>for</b> liquid products transporting), and Chassis (<b>for</b> <b>containers</b> transporting). In addition, the company also provides Generator Sets for leasing.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the equipment already described, cavers frequently carry packs containing first-aid kits, emergency equipment, and food. <b>Containers</b> <b>for</b> securely transporting urine are also commonly carried. On longer trips, <b>containers</b> <b>for</b> securely transporting feces {{out of the cave}} are carried.|$|R
50|$|The {{names of}} Iban baskets are bakak (medium-sized <b>container</b> <b>for</b> transferring, lifting or {{medium-term}} storage), singtong (<b>container</b> <b>for</b> raping ripen paddy worn at the waist), raga (small container), tubang (cylindrical backpack), lanji (tall cylindrical backpack) and probably selabit (almost rectangular shaped backpack).|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} computing a minimal-volume <b>container</b> <b>for</b> the non-overlapping packing of a given set of three-dimensional convex objects. Already the simplest versions of the problem are NP-hard so that we cannot expect to find exact polynomial time algorithms. We give constant ratio approximation algorithms for packing axis-parallel (rectangular) cuboids under translation into an axis-parallel (rectangular) cuboid as <b>container,</b> <b>for</b> cuboids under rigid motions into an axis-parallel cuboid or into an arbitrary convex <b>container,</b> and <b>for</b> packing convex polyhedra under rigid motions into an axis-parallel cuboid or arbitrary convex container. This work gives the first approximability results for the computation of minimal volume <b>containers</b> <b>for</b> the objects described...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} finding a minimum-area <b>container</b> <b>for</b> the disjoint packing {{of a set of}} convex polygons by translations. In particular, we consider axis-parallel rectangles or arbitrary convex sets as <b>containers.</b> <b>For</b> both optimization problems which are NP-hard we develop efficient constant factor approximation algorithms...|$|R
