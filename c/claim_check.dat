5000|$|He defined {{purchasing}} {{media for}} {{the academic community}} in very specific terms. [...] However, for the layperson, he recommended that people think of purchasing media as coins, paper currency, or checks that are claims on goods or services, much as is implied in the expression [...] "promissory notes." [...] He used the metaphor of a baggage <b>claim</b> <b>check.</b> [...] Banks issuing paper notes should only do so, he claimed, in direct ratio {{to the amount of}} gold in their vaults (under a gold standard) and to the things their customers were bringing to market; and any issuance above that amount would be, by definition, [...] "inflationary," [...] i.e. it will tend to cause price increases over and above those caused by direct cause-effect relationships among normal supply and demand forces. [...] Such [...] "inflationary" [...] price increases are different from those caused, for example, by a shortage of supply or by a rise in demand, because they are caused by a devaluation of the purchasing media itself through excessive issuance.|$|E

While on the train, she met Marjorie Webster, a middle-aged school teacher who was also enrolling at TSCW from Texarkana. After {{arriving}} at the train station, they both hired a taxi (driven by Edgar Ray [...] "Jack" [...] Zachary) to take them to the college dorms. As her friend was being dropped off at the Fitzgerald dormitories, Carpenter realized that she forgot to check on her trunk at the train station. She asked the driver how much it would be to take her back to the station. He replied 75 cents. Webster asked if she needed to ride back with her, but Carpenter refused, stating [...] "No, I'll go alone. I'll be alright." [...] After arriving again at the station, she went inside to get her trunk but came back a few minutes later claiming that she could not get it. She spoke to a railroad employee named Mr. Butrill who told her the trunk would not arrive until later. Zachary told Carpenter to sign the back of her <b>claim</b> <b>check</b> and that he would pick it up and deliver it to her in the morning. Carpenter agreed and gave him her luggage receipt after writing [...] "Virginia Carpenter, Room 200--Brackenridge", and a dollar for the extra trip.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} an effective medical claim fraud/abuse detection {{system based on}} data mining used by a Chilean private health insurance company. Fraud and abuse in medical claims have become a major concern within health insurance companies in Chile the last years due to the increasing losses in revenues. Processing medical claims is an exhausting manual task carried out by a few medical experts who have the responsibility of approving, modifying or rejecting the subsidies requested within a limited period from their reception. The proposed detection system uses one committee of multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLP) for {{each one of the}} entities involved in the fraud/abuse problem: medical claims, affiliates, medical professionals and employers. Results of the fraud detection system show a detection rate of approximately 75 fraudulent and abusive cases per month, making the detection 6. 6 months earlier than without the system. The application of data mining to a real industrial problem through the implementation of an automatic fraud detection system changed the original non-standard medical <b>claims</b> <b>checking</b> process to a standardized process helping to fight against new, unusual and known fraudulent/abusive behaviors.
