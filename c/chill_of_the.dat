2500|$|Hirohito and {{all members}} of the {{imperial}} family implicated in the war such as Prince Chichibu, Prince Asaka, Prince Takeda and Prince Higashikuni were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by MacArthur, with the help of Bonner Fellers who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment. Some historians criticize this decision. According to John Dower, [...] "with the full support of MacArthur's headquarters, the prosecution functioned, in effect, as a defense team for the emperor" [...] and even Japanese activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters, and who have labored to document and publicize the atrocities of the Showa regime [...] "cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, in the <b>chill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cold War, release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-winged war criminals like the later prime minister Nobusuke Kishi."

The only American edition of Who Made Stevie Crye? was published in 1984 by the highly esteemed specialty publisher Arkham House under the editorship of Jim Turner. [...] This original edition, as well as the British edition, was photographically illustrated by J. K. Potter. When David Pringle chose it for inclusion in his book , he described the novel as [...] "a playful metafiction about the real and the fictitious, about the writer and his or her creation…" [...] and concluded that the novel is [...] "…a gripping and intelligent tale of the supernatural by an author who is adept at avoiding most of the clichés of the horror genre." [...] In his mixed review of the novel, Joe Sanders writes [...] "Sometimes vivid, sometimes prosaic; sometimes involving but often affectless, this is not a novel to like casually. [...] Even when it looks like standard mass-produced pop lit, it actually is nudging us toward something more disturbing and hilarious than we're comfortable imagining. [...] It finally is impressive enough to be uneasily recommended." [...] Sanders' editor, Robert A. Collins, chides the reviewer with the footnote [...] "Ignore Sanders' uneasiness, which obviously stems from his difficulty in pegging the book's genre; Stevie Crye is a marvelous book which transcends genre, as all the best of Bishop does." [...] Author Ian Watson writes [...] "Here is a humane, trickster kaleidoscope questioning a genre and a market, and fiction, and reality too – yet exquisitely spiced with human reality – and delivering the eerie <b>chill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occult and the illicit, curdling the blood but also warming the heart." ...|$|E

40|$|Background. There is {{a common}} {{folklore}} that <b>chilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body surface causes <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> common cold symptoms, but previous clinical research has failed to demonstrate any effect of cold exposure on susceptibility to infection with common cold viruses. Objective. This study will test the hypothesis that acute cooling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feet causes <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> common cold symptoms. Methods. 180 healthy subjects were randomized to receive either a foot chill or control procedure. All {{subjects were asked to}} score common cold symptoms, before and immediately after the procedures, and twice a day for 4 / 5 days. Results. 13 / 90 subjects who were chilled reported they were suffering from a cold in the 4 / 5 days after the procedure compared to 5 / 90 control subjects (P = 0. 047). There was no evidence that chilling caused any acute change in symptom scores (P = 0. 62). Mean total symptom score for days 1 – 4 following chilling was 5. 16 (± 5. 63 s. d. n = 87) compared to a score of 2. 89 (± 3. 39 s. d. n = 88) in the control group (P = 0. 013). The subjects who reported that they developed a cold (n = 18) reported that they suffered from significantly more colds each year (P = 0. 007) compared to those subjects who did not develop a cold (n = 162).

40|$|Fishing {{technology}} onboard {{fishing vessels}} fishing pelagic species has received increased attention, especially <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> storage method on fish {{quality and the}} vessel’s energy consumption. More flexible storage methods are needed to give higher quality to the landed pelagic species thereby lowering energy consumption and investment costs. Today, when sizing storage systems, high capacity in the pre-chilling period {{is used as a}} designing criteria resulting in large installed refrigeration capacity and limited flexibility. To analyse <b>the</b> demands <b>of</b> better fish quality and lower energy consumption of these systems, a new storage method is simulated to compare it with standard storage methods like refrigerated seawater (RSW) and chilled seawater (CSW). <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simulation is to analyse <b>the</b> <b>chilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catches and operational cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systems to see if combined system (RSW/CSW) gives better results.
