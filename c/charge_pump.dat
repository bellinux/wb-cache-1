40|$|A new "multifrequency" <b>charge</b> <b>pumping</b> {{technique}} is proposed {{to determine the}} spatial distribution of interface-state density in nMOSFET's subjected to hot-carrier stress, for situations where negligible charge trapping takes place. It is shown {{that the increase in}} <b>charge</b> <b>pumping</b> current with larger gate pulse amplitude is not only due to the increase in <b>charge</b> <b>pumping</b> area, but also due to the increased energy zone of recombination in the band gap. The nonuniformity of interface-state density, spatially near the drain junction and energetically in the band gap scanned by <b>charge</b> <b>pumping</b> also contributes. The resulting uncertainty in the determination of the <b>charge</b> <b>pumping</b> edge using the conventional approach (which neglects the dependence of energy zone of recombination on gate pulse amplitude and assumes spatial uniformity of prestress interface-state density) and hence the error in the extracted post-stress damage profile is pointed out. The new technique uniquely determines the correct <b>charge</b> <b>pumping</b> edge and hence the damage distribution...|$|R

500|$|Another {{basic concept}} is the <b>charge</b> <b>pump,</b> {{a version of}} which is shown schematically in figure 6. [...] The <b>charge</b> <b>pump</b> capacitor, CP, is first charged to the input voltage. [...] It is then {{switched}} to charging the output capacitor, CO, in series with the input voltage resulting in CO eventually being charged to twice the input voltage. [...] It may take several cycles before the <b>charge</b> <b>pump</b> succeeds in fully charging CO but after steady state has been reached it is only necessary for CP to pump {{a small amount of}} charge equivalent to that being supplied to the load from CO. [...] While CO is disconnected from the <b>charge</b> <b>pump</b> it partially discharges into the load resulting in ripple on the output voltage. [...] This ripple is smaller for higher clock frequencies since the discharge time is shorter, and is also easier to filter. [...] Alternatively, the capacitors can be made smaller for a given ripple specification. [...] The practical maximum clock frequency in integrated circuits is typically in the hundreds of kilohertz.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} and {{improvements to the}} basic Dickson <b>charge</b> <b>pump.</b> [...] Many of these are concerned with reducing {{the effect of the}} transistor drain-source voltage. [...] This can be very significant if the input voltage is small, such as a low-voltage battery. [...] With ideal switching elements the output is an integral multiple of the input (two for a doubler) but with a single-cell battery as the input source and MOSFET switches the output will be far less than this value since much of the voltage will be dropped across the transistors. [...] For a circuit using discrete components the Schottky diode would be a better choice of switching element for its extremely low voltage drop in the on state. [...] However, integrated circuit designers prefer to use the easily available MOSFET and compensate for its inadequacies with increased circuit complexity.Yuan, 14-21 ...|$|E

2500|$|A bang-bang <b>charge</b> <b>pump</b> phase {{detector}} must {{always have a}} dead band where the phases of inputs are close enough that the detector detects no phase error. For this reason, bang-bang {{phase detector}}s [...] are associated with significant minimum peak-to-peak jitter, because of drift within the dead band. However these types, having outputs consisting of very narrow pulses at lock, are very useful for applications requiring very low VCO spurious outputs. [...] The narrow pulses contain very little energy and are easy to filter out of the VCO control voltage. [...] This results in low VCO control line ripple and therefore low FM sidebands on the VCO.|$|E

2500|$|Converting DC {{power from}} one voltage to another {{is much more}} complicated. [...] One method of DC-to-DC {{conversion}} first converts power to AC (using a device called an inverter), then uses a transformer to change the voltage, and finally rectifies power back to DC. A frequency of typically several tens of kilohertz is used, as this requires much smaller inductance than at lower frequencies and obviates the use of heavy, bulky, and expensive iron-cored units. Another method of converting DC voltages uses a <b>charge</b> <b>pump,</b> using rapid switching to change the connections of capacitors; this technique is generally limited to supplies up {{to a couple of}} watts, owing to the size of capacitors required.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} quantum <b>charge</b> <b>pumping</b> {{of electrons}} across a superconducting double barrier {{structure in the}} adiabatic limit. The superconducting barriers {{are assumed to be}} reflection-less so that an incident electron on the barrier can either tunnel through it or Andreev reflect from it. In this structure, quantum <b>charge</b> <b>pumping</b> can be achieved (a) by modulating the amplitudes, Δ_ 1 and Δ_ 2 of the two superconducting gaps or alternatively, (b) by a periodic modulation of the order parameter phases, ϕ_ 1 and ϕ_ 2 of the superconducting barriers. In the former case, we show that the superconducting gap gives rise to a very sharp resonance in the transmission resulting in quantization of <b>pumped</b> <b>charge,</b> when the <b>pumping</b> contour encloses the resonance. On the other hand, we find that quantization is hard to achieve in the latter case. We show that inclusion of weak electron-electron interaction in the quantum wire leads to renormalisation group evolution of the transmission amplitude towards the perfectly transmitting limit due to proximity effects. Hence as we approach the zero temperature limit, we get destruction of quantized <b>pumped</b> <b>charge.</b> This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} case of <b>charge</b> <b>pumping</b> in a double barrier in a Luttinger liquid where quantized <b>charge</b> <b>pumping</b> is actually achieved in the zero temperature limit.
