The “mechanical” systems of Operational intelligence (Oi), as requisitely birthed and buttressed by robust theories of interaction, within the context of casino gaming entertainment-focused hospitality, might be fundamentally comprehended as being akin to an entity maintaining a collection of precision enhancing accountability information tools. These instruments of understanding meritoriously provide the <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organization</b> marginal evaluative leverage. This discretionary advantage is derived from an exacting, methodical process of continuously garnering valid and reliable patron observational data. The congregation and eventual dissemination of multi-user appropriate and thus inherently end decision maker interpretable facts and figures is the intended derivative from a procedural inclusion of an (increasingly seamlessly automated) obtainment and manipulation of selectively germane operational activity information. The garnered raw product of Oi is player and / or non-gaming visitors’ data. Records of customers’ demonstrated, as opposed to merely espoused, desires and demands are refined through (Oi system assisted) hopefully competent, yet still human and thus consequently fallible judgment dependent, scenario specific analysis. Accountable analytics is the necessary impetus for an enhanced grasp of guests’ actualized actions, as opposed to individual and communally (merely perceived to be held) intents. If a universally supported organization choice is brought to fruition to pursue and gradually incorporate the benefits of Oi, including the definitive competitive advantage of a bolstered knowledge foundation of client activity, then the catalyst will exist for resource maximizing, progressively effective gaming based hospitality venue stakeholders to capitalize. Once the bench strength of the Oi beneficiaries has been boosted with an ability to manage more “scientifically,” in lieu of the status quo preserving intuitive approach, then a fertile ground to achieve, by figuratively leveraging the decision assuring power of the group’s newly stocked with punter’s proven proclivity facts head instead of bias harboring gut, the superseding goal of hedonic libertarian hospitality venues to induce incrementally contributive patron spend has been tilled.

40|$|Award date: 24 March 2014 Supervisor: Professor Giovanni Sartor, European University InstituteAt the moment, no {{copyright}} statute {{refers to}} news aggregation. It {{is not surprising}} then that news aggregators present a challenge for any court {{having to deal with}} any aspect of their activity. Indeed, with any particular form of aggregation {{there are a number of}} competing interests at play: the copyright holder, the aggregator, the reader and the public at large. So far, there were only two suits against Google Inc. based on copyright infringement concerns from Google News, one in the US and one in Europe, but they revealed a lot of problems that existing copyright law may have with news aggregators. The first claim (brought in 2005 in the United States) where the claimant Agence France Press claimed that Google Inc. was reproducing and publicly displaying AFP’s photographs, headlines, and story leads on Google’s news aggregation website without AFP’s permission, resulted in a settlement (after 2 years in court). But the case brought against Google in Europe in 2006 by Copiepresse (the <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organization</b> for Belgian newspaper publishers in French and German languages) found that Google had infringed copyright law. Interestingly, after the court door was broken down, a new practice regarding Google News appeared: in Germany, France and Belgium leading newspaper publishers had called on their governments to adopt a law to force internet search engines like Google to pay for displaying their content on services such as Google News. Consequently, agreements with Belgian and French governments were concluded by Google. In Germany, a new law passed granting news publishers a new neighbouring right pushing Google to pay a licensing fee even for the snippets of content used to display search results (in force as of 1 st of August 2013). The main issue both courts and legislators have to address when dealing with Google News is the question whether short fragments of news works along with their headlines and titles (so-called snippets) are protected by copyright or not. This touches one of the basic concepts of copyright law, i. e. copyright originality, not understood identically within copyright jurisdictions over the world, and challenged additionally, at least in the EU, with recent decision of the ECJ in Infopaq where the court found that a fragment of news article consisting of 11 words may be protected as an independent work. The impact of the Infopaq ruling should not be underestimated: even in the UK, where short forms of creative activity like titles or headlines, have not been traditionally protected under copyright, a recent ruling in NLA v. Meltwater concluded that news headlines may be copyrighted. Assuming that Google News is involved in acts of exploitation of copyrighted works, the other important question arises that is whether any limitation / exception provided by copyright law is applicable to this service. What can come into play in this regard are (1) the exception of quotation, (2) the exception for report on news events, and (3) the fair use defences...|$|E

The Copyright Commission conducts the proceedings essentially based on the provisions amended by the Constitutional Tribunal in its judgment of 24 January 2006 case file SK 40 / 04, in which it ruled on the unconstitutionality of Article 108 (3) of the aforementioned Act on Copyright regarding proceedings before the Commission on the approval of the remuneration tables for the use of objects of copyright or performances submitted by <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organizations.</b> As a result of the amendment, the binding regulations provide for defining the scope of proceeding before the Commission on the approval of rates submitted by <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organizations</b> with ensuring, in case of contesting a Commission’s decision, the possibility to continue the proceedings before a general court. In the legislation the participation of parties in determining the composition of the adjudicating panel of the Commission, the introduction of restrictions on the length of proceedings and the opportunity to challenge a decision of the adjudicating panel of the Commission by filing a relevant application to the participant and to submit the case to court were exposed. In the assessment of the proceeding concerning the approval of remuneration tables for objects of copyright or related rights, its consistency and compatibility with the concepts of the modern settlement of disputes were indicated. Additionally, the compliance of the provisions with the EU law standards laid down in the latest EU legislation was underlined, including regulations aimed at ensuring the coordination of national provisions concerning the conditions for copyright and related rights <b>management</b> by <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> <b>organizations</b> to ensure a high level of management, transparency and reporting according to the objectives of Directive 2014 / 26 /EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on <b>collective</b> <b>management</b> of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online use in the internal market.

40|$|An {{issue which}} {{recently}} has {{gained increased attention}} from legislators is how to stimulate the digitization and online availability of the collections held by libraries, museums and other cultural institutions – {{sometimes referred to as}} our “common heritage” – {{and at the same time}} give full respect to established copyright norms. At European level, this attention is evident in the Digital Libraries Initiative, the Communication from the European Commission on Copyright in the Knowledge Economy, the Commission’s Digital Agenda for Europe and its recent Communication on a Single Market for Intellectual Property Rights. Inherent in these policy documents is the recognition that the new information technologies have created vast opportunities to make the common heritage of Europe more accessible for users online. It is also a shared belief that such access – if coherent with basic copyright principles – will befor the mutual benefit of users, right holders and the society at large. In line with this the Commission has supported the creation and development of a common access point for Europe’s cultural heritage, Europeana. However, several issues from a copyright perspective have to be solved before undertaking mass-digitization and online dissemination of the collections held by these institutions. One of them is how to make the said digitization and online dissemination lawful from a copyright perspective. To the extent that an item in a cultural institution’s collection is (still) protected by copyright, those acts fall under the author’s exclusive right to authorize and prohibit use of his or her work. As the administrative (“transaction”) costs of finding and negotiating an individual license with every right holder would rise to astronomical levels, there is an obvious risk that major parts of the collections will not be digitized and disseminated online. For this reason, the most practical solution would probably lie in the area of collective rights management. A way forward is the extended collective license (ECL) model as established and developed in the Nordic countries. The essential component of the ECL model is that it extends a freely negotiated agreement between a <b>Collective</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Organization</b> (CMO) and a user so that it binds also non-members’ rights, sometimes referred to as “outsiders’ rights”. The legal implication of this extension effect is that the agreement not only gives the user the right to use outsider’s rights without any risk of civil remedies but that that it also provides full limitation against criminal sanctions. To safeguard the outsiders’ interests, the legally supported extended effect only occurs provided that certain conditions have been met. These conditions are, mainly, outsiders’ possibility to opt out, equal treatment vis-à-vis members of the organization and receipt of remuneration. There are also conditions related to the representativeness and supervision of the eligible CMOs. The ECL model has been under consideration by the Commission as a possible solution to stimulate the digitization and online availability of the collections held by cultural institutions. An additional challenge is to make the collections available cross-border, i. e. also to other countries (territories) than the one where the cultural institution is located. It is inherent in the policy documents of the European commission and also the establishment of Europeana that there is a clear political aim to stimulate such cross-border dissemination. According to prevalent copyright rules, rights for dissemination online have to be cleared in every country where the content can be accessed. Applied to cultural institutions this means that they would have to get a license from CMOs in every EU member state. This would of course lead to substantial administrative costs for the institutions. However, so far no solution have been brought forward which takes into account and could be acceptable by both cultural institutions and right holders. Two viable cross-border solutions are a country of transmission principle or a solution based on voluntary measures by the national CMOs. A country of transmission principle holds that cultural institutions should only be obliged to obtain a license in the country where the institution initiated the online dissemination. This solution would require legislative intervention at EU level. The other solution essentially means that national CMOs would give each other a mandate to issue multi-territory licenses. At first glance, an ECL provision combined with either of the cross-border solutions outlined above may be regarded as favoring the cultural institutions’ interests, as it gives them the privilege of both an ECL provision and a simplified measure for cross-border rights clearance. However, the scope of an ECL provision for the benefit of these institutions would primarily be to make available content that is not of a contemporary commercial nature. Hence, the model would aim at establishing a mechanism which would create a supply of cultural heritage content. It is in the interest of the society as a whole that also this content is made available online...|$|E
