It opens doors on languages for a broader range of learners, nurturing self-confidence in young learners and those who have not responded well to formal language instruction in general education. It provides exposure to the language without requiring extra time in the curriculum, which can be of particular interest in vocational settings." [...] This approach involves learning subjects such as history, geography or others, through an additional language. It can be very successful in enhancing the learning of languages and other subjects, and helping children develop a positive attitude towards themselves as language learners.|$|E

Therefore, the research project presented in this thesis was carried out to learn more about the usefulness of <b>CLIL.</b> Thus, the thesis deals with the advantages and problems of <b>CLIL.</b> The purpose of the thesis is to provide an overview of the most relevant literature regarding <b>CLIL.</b> The goal of the action research is to investigate what the <b>CLIL</b> teachers and the <b>CLIL</b> students of Miina Härma Gymnasium, Tartu see as the advantages and problems of <b>CLIL,</b> in reality being a part of it themselves. Consequently, the present thesis has a potential to make a valuable contribution to the field of <b>CLIL</b> application research. Chapter one is based on secondary sources and gives an overview of the different methods most often used within <b>CLIL,</b> thereafter the main advantages of <b>CLIL</b> are described, which are followed by the most common problems regarding <b>CLIL.</b> Furthermore, there is a section about its educational service. The next section provides information on <b>CLIL</b> in Estonia, followed by the description of the qualities of good <b>CLIL</b> teachers and strategies for teachers towards quality <b>CLIL.</b> Last, ten tips for <b>CLIL</b> teachers of maths and science are presented and discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT RESUMEN Content and {{language}} integrated learning (<b>CLIL)</b> {{has been widely}} implemented in educational systems in Europe since the mid- 1990 s based on their multilingual education policy. <b>CLIL</b> integrates acquisition of subject knowledge with language learning, either a second or foreign language, simultaneously.

40|$|Content and Language Integrated Learning (<b>CLIL)</b> is a {{contemporary}} trend in education. It refers to every situation where a subject or its part {{is taught in}} a foreign language. The focus of this work is Mathematics in English. My aim was to confirm or reject the hypothesis of <b>CLIL</b> being motivating for the students and possible to implement in the Czech educational system. In {{the first part of}} this work, I focused on methodology related to <b>CLIL,</b> analyzing the language-teaching and general educational theories, methods and strategies used in <b>CLIL</b> lessons. The second part consisted of a minor survey on <b>CLIL</b> implementation in Prague and related opinions and attitudes of the school representatives. The third part presented detailed description of a <b>CLIL</b> lesson plan and reflection on my four teaching experiments. The <b>CLIL</b> lesson proved to be motivating for the students and seen as beneficial by the teachers, the methods chosen were appreciated; however, there are several issues that need to be dealt with in terms of successful <b>CLIL</b> implementation in the Czech Republic...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{interest}} in Content and Language Integrated Learning (<b>CLIL)</b> has resulted in enthusiasm in and active pursuit of improved methods of foreign/ second-language (L 2) teaching in Europe. However, the definition {{and scope of the}} term <b>CLIL</b> both internally, as used by <b>CLIL</b> advocates in Europe, and exter-nally, as compared with immersion education in and outside Europe, indicate that the core characteristics of <b>CLIL</b> are understood in different ways with respect to: the balance between language and content instruction, the nature of the target languages involved, instructional goals, defining characteristics of student participants, and pedagogical approaches to integrating language and content instruction. We argue further that attempts to define <b>CLIL</b> by distin-guishing it from immersion approaches to L 2 education are often misguided. The aim {{of this article is to}} examine these ambiguities and to call for clarification of the definition of <b>CLIL.</b> Clarification is critical if <b>CLIL</b> is to evolve and improve systematically and if <b>CLIL</b> educators are to benefit from the experiences and knowledge acquired in other educational settings. 1...|$|E

First, the teachers used pupils’ L 1 to differentiate their teaching and to consider the pupils’ affective and emotional features. Second, the pupils’ L 1 use was generally accepted in <b>CLIL</b> lessons. The study suggests that systematic and justifiable use of pupils’ L 1 can work as an effective method in supporting weak pupils’ participation in <b>CLIL</b> education.

40|$|<b>CLIL</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic pedagogic trends in {{language}} teaching in Europe and yet, the enthusiasm with which this innovation is implemented by stakeholders and “made a success” is not fully understood. In this paper we argue for an investigation of <b>CLIL</b> implementation as a form of extended language policy (Spolsky 2004), which relates language management, practice and beliefs, and so expands the notion of policy well beyond top-down legislation. In this contribution, the suggested centrality of beliefs to <b>CLIL</b> policy analysis will be shown by a detailed investigation into the lay theories of teachers and learners involved in <b>CLIL</b> instruction in Austrian upper secondary colleges of technology, which traditionally attract students considered as relatively unsuccessful foreign language learners. The data consist of 48 in-depth interviews with teachers and students in this setting, covering a range of teacher specialisations and of student abilities. The discursive and content analysis of these interviews shows clear clusters of beliefs relating to language learning, the effects and benefits of <b>CLIL</b> and to the construction of success regarding <b>CLIL.</b> Findings suggest that the strength of beliefs and the relative absence of language management result in a construction of <b>CLIL</b> and of <b>CLIL</b> success that is partly at odds with those of experts or policy makers, but which is linked directly to local <b>CLIL</b> practices.

40|$|Content and {{language}} integrated learning is flexible {{in order to}} take account {{of a wide range of}} contexts. However, for <b>CLIL</b> to be effective, certain principles should be recognized. <b>CLIL</b> input is advised to be carefully planned, contextualized and rigorously monitored (Coyle, Hood and Marsh, 2010). The main aim of <b>CLIL</b> education in the Czech Republic is to respond to the rich language and cultural diversity of Europe, develop multilingualism in its citizens, meet the demands for mobility, enhance cooperation in education and improve knowledge of foreign languages and cultures (<b>CLIL</b> at school in Europe, country reports, 2005).

40|$|Encouraged by European and {{national}} policies, Content and Language Integrated Learning (<b>CLIL)</b> {{has been on}} a steady rise over the past decades. Research results uniformly suggest that <b>CLIL</b> benefits L 2 acquisition, even though <b>CLIL</b> strands have frequently been reported to be selective with respect to learner variables such as intelligence and motivation. Combining learner corpus research (LCR) with second language acquisition (SLA) methodologies, the present study analyses how much of the perceived success of <b>CLIL</b> programmes is due to <b>CLIL</b> itself, and how much is triggered by selectivity. In an L 2 database compiled for this purpose, we link the Secondary-Level Corpus of Learner English (SCooLE), a learner corpus of about 250, 000 tokens, with experimental data and data on more than fifty learner variables collected by means of a learner profile questionnaire and psychometric tests. Being a prime example of the lexis-grammar interface in L 2 acquisition, the English passive is the focus of our comparison of data from <b>CLIL</b> and non-CLIL settings. Occurring most frequently in scientific writing, we assume that the passive is more prevalent in <b>CLIL</b> materials, which cover the social and natural sciences, than in EFL (English as a Foreign Language) materials. An analysis of the Teaching Materials Corpus (TeaMC) reveals that this is indeed the case. Moreover, <b>CLIL</b> materials comprise fewer non-central passives, i. e. passives displaying adjectival features. We therefore expect to find both quantitative and qualitative differences in passive constructions produced by <b>CLIL</b> and non-CLIL learners. An analysis conducted in the framework of Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (CIA) reveals that <b>CLIL</b> participants produce a greater number of passives as well as a lower proportion of non-central and erroneous passives, thus making their texts more target-like. By means of multiple regression modelling, we assess the role of <b>CLIL</b> as opposed to its selectivity. Results show that <b>CLIL</b> makes a significant contribution to L 2 acquisition, although the selectivity of the system plays a greater part in explaining variability. Experimental data yields similar, but even clearer results. We conclude that, even though <b>CLIL</b> is selective, it is beneficial to the acquisition of the English passive.
