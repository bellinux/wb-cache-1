5|$|For consistency, fees in {{the record}} {{transfer}} tables below are all sourced from BBC Sport's contemporary reports of each transfer. Where the report mentions an initial fee potentially rising to a higher figure depending on <b>contractual</b> clauses being satisfied in the future, only the initial fee is listed in the tables.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder's {{abduction}} was {{devised by}} Chris Carter {{towards the end}} of seventh season as a way of allowing the actor to leave the series.

5|$|Lacey Chabert voiced Meg for {{the first}} {{production}} season (14 episodes), but, because of a <b>contractual</b> agreement, was never credited. Chabert left the series due to time constraints with her acting role in Party of Five, as well as schoolwork.|$|E
5|$|Legal {{decisions}} {{from other}} suits have set <b>contractual</b> law precedents {{in regards to}} long-arm statutes, the limitations of franchise agreements, and ethical business practices; many of these decisions have helped define general business dealings that continue to shape the entire marketplace.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} film, the {{production}} of Jaws 2 was troubled. The original director, John D. Hancock, proved to be unsuitable for an action film {{and was replaced by}} Szwarc. Scheider, who only reprised his role to end a <b>contractual</b> issue with Universal, was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc.|$|E
5|$|Nine Inch Nails {{frontman}} Trent Reznor {{announced in}} 2007 that the band had completed its <b>contractual</b> obligations to its record label, Interscope Records, and {{would no longer}} be working with the company.

5|$|There remains some {{uncertainty}} {{whether the}} source test or nature test {{ought to be}} the determining test. It appears, though, that the impact of Datafin remains qualified in the light of other decisions where the source of the power was held to be the determining factor. It is also worth noting that the effect of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between <b>contractual</b> and governmental powers. Where there is a <b>contractual</b> relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person, this tends to place the dispute on the private law side of the public–private divide, making the decision not amenable to judicial review.|$|E
5|$|When James Cameron {{agreed to}} make Spider-Man, Carolco lawyers simply used his {{previous}} Terminator 2 contract as a template. A clause in this agreement gave Cameron {{the right to decide}} on movie and advertising credits. Show business trade articles and advertisements made no mention of Golan, who was still actively assembling the elements for the film. In 1993, Golan complained publicly and finally instigated legal action against Carolco for disavowing his <b>contractual</b> guarantee credit as producer. On the other hand, Cameron had the <b>contractual</b> right to decide on credits. Eventually, Carolco sued Viacom and Columbia to recover broadcast and home video rights, and the two studios countersued. 20th Century Fox, though not part of the litigation, contested Cameron’s participation, claiming exclusivity on his services as a director under yet another contract. In 1996, Carolco, 21st Century, and Marvel went bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1960s, the carrier {{provided}} some initial aviation support to the Ethiopia-United States Mapping Mission in its operation to acquire topographic maps of Ethiopia. The firm changed from a corporation to a share company in 1965, and changed its name from Ethiopian Air Lines to Ethiopian Airlines. By 1966, the <b>contractual</b> relationship with TWA was adjusted to reflect the transfer of management with the appointment of an Ethiopian deputy general manager. Two Boeing 720s were in operation and a Boeing 707-320C was due to be phased in by , when the carrier ordered a second -320C.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the central}} and local governments kept an {{enormous}} number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while <b>contractual</b> language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.|$|E
5|$|Anarchy Onlines story, {{from the}} player's point of view, began in 29,475, after {{the most recent}} peace treaty had been signed between Omni-Tek and the Clans. ICC {{peacekeeping}} troops later moved into some cities to protect neutral observers of the war who had rejected their <b>contractual</b> obligations with Omni-Tek, but did not align themselves with the Clans. Omni-Tek, the Clans, and the neutral observers make up the game's three playable factions and control much of Rubi-Ka's terraformed surface.|$|E

In this situation the party who is assigned the debt can sue the debtor despite any <b>contractual</b> agreement between them. Again, this is permitted by statute, specifically the Law of Property Act 1925.|$|E
5|$|Both the Holt Manufacturing Company and C.L.Best {{were hurt}} by the {{depression}} of 1920–21 which further inhibited sales. Both companies streamlined their over-lapping product lines. The two companies had spent about US$1.5 million (about $ today) in legal fees fighting each other in various <b>contractual,</b> trademark and patent infringement lawsuits since 1905, but, {{on the advice of}} investors, the two companies merged in 1925 to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co. , Caterpillar Inc. was the 229th largest company in the world.|$|E

5|$|Daft Punk were {{scheduled}} {{to appear on the}} episode of The Colbert Report on 6 August 2013 to promote Random Access Memories, but were unable to do so because of <b>contractual</b> obligations regarding the duo's later appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk were unaware of any exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. In 2015, Daft Punk appeared alongside several other musicians to announce their co-ownership of the music service Tidal at its relaunch.|$|E
