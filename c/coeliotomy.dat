40|$|Case report: A 5 -year-old captive male diamond python (Morelia spilota spilota) was {{presented}} with a 1 -month history of regurgitation and anorexia and discrete coelomic distention. Physical examination revealed a firm, immobile mass at approximately two-thirds of the snout-vent length {{from the front of}} the head. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspirate biopsy of the mass in the region of the stomach showed necrosis with bacterial infiltration and possibly neoplastic changes. A gastroscopy was conducted, but showed grossly normal gastric mucosa, confirmed by biopsy.

40|$|Summary. -The {{influence}} of surgical stress on resistance to i. v. challenge with Walker 256 tumour cells {{was investigated in}} rats, {{with respect to the}} functional state of the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Phagocytic activity ofthe RES was evaluated by colloid (gelatinized [1311] " RE test lipid emulsion ") clearance, and opsonin levels were determined by bioassay. Reticuloendothelial clearance capacity was signifi-cantly (P < 0. 05) depressed 60 min following surgery (<b>coeliotomy</b> plusjejunal entero-tomy) as quantified by both humoral and cellular parameters ofRE function. Phago-cytic depression was primarily due to impaired hepatic Kupffer cell function and related to a deficiency in the phagocytic supporting capacity of plasma, also referred to as opsonic or recognition factor (RF) capacity. During the postoperative period of RES colloid clearance depression, pulmonary localization of the blood-borne test particulate matter increased. Rats challenged with 5 lCr-labelled viable tumour cells at a dose of 1. 0 x 106 i. v., either prior to or during the postoperative period of RE depression, manifested a significant (P < 0. 05) increment in pulmonary localization of the viable tumour cells, and a decrease (P < 0. 05) in hepatic clearance.

40|$|A 9 -year-old {{sterilised}} female domestic short-hair cat {{was referred}} {{with a history}} of vomiting and anorexia of 3 months’ duration. Biochemistry, full-blood counts, thoracic radiographs, feline pancreatic-specific lipase, abdominal ultrasonography and feline immunodeficiency virus/feline leukaemia virus (FIV/FeLV) SNAP tests had been performed. Mild hypochloraemia and moderate hypokalaemia were evident on initial presentation. Abdominal ultrasonography initially revealed unilateral renal nodules on the left side. These were subjected to fine-needle aspiration and cytological evaluation. A neuroendocrine tumour was suspected, and biopsies via midline <b>coeliotomy</b> were taken to confirm the diagnosis. Initial histopathology diagnosed primary renal carcinomas or neuroendocrine neoplasia; however, the definitive diagnosis became renal paragangliomas after immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy were performed. The cat was regularly monitored with serum biochemistry parameters, blood pressure determinations, thoracic radiographs and subsequent abdominal ultrasonography. Biochemistry, radiography and blood pressures remained normal over a 24 -week follow-up period, while subsequent ultrasonography revealed tumour progression in both number and size in both kidneys. Primary neuroendocrine tumours of the kidney are frequently incorrectly diagnosed as other renal tumours such as renal cell carcinoma, mesonephric tumours or undifferentiated carcinomas. This case report highlights the importance of additional testing, including immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy, to obtain a definitive diagnosis of paragangliomas. </p...|$|E

Thoracic ultrasonography and radiography {{showed that a}} heterogeneous mass was present within the pericardial sac, and the mass continued caudally with the mesenteric fat. On CT, {{the outline of the}} diaphragm was not continuous and there was an obvious defect with diaphragmatic thickening present at the mid-level of the liver. A pleural effusion and a small-volume pericardial effusion were also present. A ventral midline <b>coeliotomy</b> and median sternotomy revealed a 5 × 6 × 7 cm firm, irregular, tan-coloured soft tissue mass within the pericardial sac attached to both the diaphragmatic defect and liver. The mass was carefully dissected away from the heart and the diaphragmatic defect was repaired with primary closure. Postoperatively, the cat had a persistent pneumothorax that required continuous pleural suction for 41 h. The cat died 44 h postoperatively. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the mass to be a hepatic fibrosarcoma incarcerated in a peritoneopericardial diaphragmatic hernia (PPDH).

40|$|Case summary A 7 -year-old {{neutered}} male Persian cat {{was presented}} for acute vomiting and inappetence. Physical examination revealed severe abdominal distension. Radiographs demonstrated pneumoperitoneum, megaoesophagus and generalised gaseous distension of the digestive tract. Exploratory <b>coeliotomy</b> was performed, revealing markedly distended and thickened {{small and large}} intestines with no observable peristalsis. No intestinal perforation was present. Bacteriological and cytological analysis of abdominal fluid revealed a septic peritonitis involving Pasteurella multocida. Full-thickness intestinal biopsies demonstrated lymphocytic ganglioneuritis localised to the enteric nervous system, in association with glandular atrophy and muscular layer hypertrophy. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and analgesics were given. The cat’s general condition gradually improved after the addition of pyridostigmine bromide (0. 5 mg/kg q 12 h PO), initiated 3 days postsurgery. Vomiting resolved and did not recur. Follow-up radiographs at 15 days, and 1 and 6 months showed persistent intestinal ileus, milder than on the pretreatment radiographs.

Oesophageal and rectal temperatures were measured at various time points. At the end of surgery, group 1 patients (n= 10) were lavaged with 200  ml/kg sterile isotonic saline at 34 ± 1 °C and group 2 (n= 10) at 40 ± 1 °C. Groups were similar with respect to age, mass, body condition and surgical incision length. Duration of anaesthesia, surgical procedures and peritoneal lavage was similar between groups. Linear regression showed no significant change in oesophageal temperature during the lavage period for group 1 (P= 0. 64), but a significant increase for group 2 patients (P< 0. 0001), with mean temperature changes of − 0. 5 °C (from (36. 3 °C to 35. 9 °C) and + 0. 9 °C (from 35. 4 °C to 36. 3 °C), respectively.

40|$|The aims of {{surgical}} management of acute GDV include: ■ Gastric decompression and repositioning; ■ Assessment of {{the viability of}} abdominal organs; ■ Removal of devitalised tissue; ■ Gastropexy. Time {{should be taken to}} fully evaluate and treat an affected dog surgically. It has been shown that, provid-ing all other aspects of preanaesthetic stabilisation and anaesthetic administration are appropriate, increased surgical time does not put an animal at additional risk. The surgeon must be thorough and methodical to optimise the chance of recovery. The dog should be prepared aseptically for surgery and a ventral midline <b>coeliotomy</b> performed. Care should be taken when entering the peritoneal cavity to avoid puncturing the dilated stomach. The incision should be as long as necessary to allow adequate inspection of all abdominal organs and facilitate gastric decompression and gastropexy (typically from the xiphoid to beyond the umbilicus). Abdominal retractors (Balfour or Gosset retractors) can be used to aid abdominal exposure. Gastric decompression and repositioning A distended stomach is immediately obvious on entering the peritoneal cavity. In dogs with a 180 to 360 º clock-wise gastric rotation, the stomach will have entered the omental bursa and will, therefore, be covered by an omental leaf. Despite preoperative gastric decompres-sion, further decompression during surgery is usually helpful. This should be performed by an assistant passing an orogastric tube and is facilitated by the surgeon manu-ally guiding the tube through the cardiac sphincter. C...|$|E
40|$|Case summary A 6 -month-old {{spayed female}} {{domestic}} shorthair cat presented {{for evaluation of}} suspected bite wounds over the right caudal thorax and left cranial flank. Thoracic radiographs identified a mild right-sided pneumothorax, a small volume of right-sided pleural effusion, with increased soft tissue opacity in the right cranial and middle lung lobes. Abdominal ultrasound identified a very small gall bladder and several small pockets of free peritoneal fluid. Cytological analysis of peritoneal fluid was consistent with a modified transudate. Following initial diagnostic investigations, yellow–orange fluid began to emanate from the right-sided thoracic wound. Biochemical analysis of this fluid was consistent with bile. Exploratory <b>coeliotomy</b> revealed a right-sided radial diaphragmatic tear, with herniation of the quadrate liver lobe and {{a portion of the}} gall bladder into the right pleural space. The gall bladder was bi-lobed and avulsion of a single herniated lobe resulted in leakage of bile into the right pleural cavity, without concurrent bile peritonitis (biloabdomen). The cat underwent total cholecystectomy and diaphragmatic defect repair and recovered uneventfully. Relevance and novel information To our knowledge, at the time of writing non-iatrogenic isolated bilothorax without concurrent biloabdomen has not been previously reported in the cat. This case highlights the importance of thorough assessment of cats with seemingly innocuous thoracic bite wounds. Despite the rarity of its occurrence, bilothorax should be considered a differential in cats with pleural effusion, {{even in the absence of}} bile peritonitis.

Reticuloendothelial clearance capacity was significantly (P less than 0 - 05) depressed 60 min following surgery (<b>coeliotomy</b> plus jejunal enterotomy) as quantified by both humoral and cellular parameters of RE function. Phagocytic depression was primarily due to impaired hepatic Kupffer cell function and related to a deficiency in the phagocytic supporting capacity of plasma, also referred to as opsonic or recognition factor (RF) capacity. During the postoperative period of RES colloid clearance depression, pulmonary localization of the blood-borne test particulate matter increased. Rats challenged with 51 Cr-labelled viable tumour cells at a dose of 1 - 0 X 106 i. v., either prior to or during the postoperative period of RE depression, manifested a significant (P less than 0 - 05) increment in pulmonary localization of the viable tumour cells, and a decrease (P less than 0 - 05) in hepatic clearance. Evaluation of survival patterns demonstrated a significant (P less than 0 - 01) decrease in host resistance to i. v. tumour cell challenge (2 X 103 cells) during the postoperative period of RE depression and hypo-opsonaemia. Sham-anaesthetized control animals survived 17 - 9 +/- 0 - 8 days, while animals challenged during the period of RE depression survived 7 - 9 +/- 0 - 4 days. An increased incidence of respiratory distress and nasal discharge was observed in the animals with impaired survival. Thus, surgical manipulation may transiently compromise RES systemic host defence and may be reflected in an increment in the pulmonary localization of blood-borne tumour cells. The relationship of this altered pattern of tumour cell distribution to the impaired survival remains to be determined, and warrants investigations...|$|E
40|$|Colic {{can cause}} an {{activation}} of neutrophils with release {{in the blood}} flow of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a specific enzyme with strong oxidative activity. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the evolution of plasma MPO after colic surgery. Materials included 13 adult horses that underwent an emergency celiotomy for acute intestinal obstruction. Venous blood samples were collected into EDTA anticoagulated tubes before surgery, during surgery after correction of the intestinal lesion and during the recovery of anaesthesia. In the postoperative period samples were taken every 4 hours during the first 4 days (from day 0 until day 4), every 12 hours during the days 4 and 5 and every 24 hours until day 10. MPO was assayed with a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analysis was performed by one way Anova with student- Newman-Keuls post test on data obtained for each time point. Significance was set at p < 0. 05. The horses were operated for an obstruction strangulated or not of the small or the large intestine. In six cases the postoperative period was uneventful, the 7 remaining developed one or 2 severe complications. Eight horses were discharged and 5 died during the hospitalization. The general aspect of the curve of mean plasmatic MPO can be described as follow: An increase was observed from the admission on until a peak of concentration occurring generally during the time of recovery from the anaesthesia with the highest mean value reaching 740. 84 +/- 507. 61 ng/ml. This was followed by a progressive decrease until the lowest value, usually near to day 2 after the recovery from anaesthesia corresponding to 171. 79 +/- 76. 21 ng/ml of MPO. Afterwards, the mean concentrations increased slowly until postoperative day 10. In the majority of cases a stable and low MPO value (plateau) was observed during approximately 2 days (from day 1 to day 3 postoperatively). The initial peak of MPO after surgery could be associated to the neutrophil activation consequent to the intestinal disorder and the intense stimulation of the <b>coeliotomy.</b> The following significant reduction in concentration could be attributed to MPO infiltration into the tissues with a critical point at approximately 2 days after surgery. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the role of the MPO and neutrophils in the pathophysiology of horses in the postoperative period after colic surgery. Peer reviewe...|$|E
