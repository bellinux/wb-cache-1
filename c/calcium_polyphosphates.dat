40|$|Current {{problems}} associated with bone allografts include risk of disease transmission, limited availability, and cost. Synthetic scaffolds have been proposed as substitute graft materials to address these issues. <b>Calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> is a novel synthetic scaffold material that has shown good mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Here, we evaluated <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> {{in terms of its}} ability to support cell proliferation and differentiation in vivo. Calcium polypho-sphate, morsellized cancellous bone, and hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate particles were seeded with marrow stro-mal cells and implanted subcutaneously in the back of NOD/Scid mice. At 7, 14, and 28 days the samples were harvested and the proliferation characteristics and gene expression were analyzed. All tested graft materials had similar prolifer-ation characteristics and gene expression. The subcutaneous environment had a stronger impact on the proliferation and differentiation of the cells than the scaffold material itself. However, it was shown that <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> is superior to hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate and bone in its ability to support cell survival in vivo.

An ideal biomaterial will be cytocompatible – it will not cause an adverse response in the body – and will have similar physical properties to the material it is replacing.

MCP was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry―thermmogravimetry (DSC―TGA) and possible mechanism of the polymerization reaction was proposed. The results show that polymerization of MCP mainly produces CPP. When the elevation temperature is below 1000 ¡æ, polymerization degree increases; however {{the opposite is true}} when the polymerization temperature exceeds 1000 ¡æ.

40|$|A {{poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate}} complex {{extracted from}} the plasma membranes of genetically competent Escherichia coli contained polyhydroxybutyrate:polyphosphate:calcium in molar ratios approximating 1 : 1 : 0. 5. The chain length of the polyhydroxybutyrate was estimated as 120 - 200 subunits, {{and that of the}} polyphosphate was estimated as 130 - 170 subunits.

The extraction method was previously used to isolate a channel-forming complex containing poly- 3 -hydroxybutyrate and <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> from Escherichia coli. This complex is also present in eukaryotic membranes, and is located primarily in mitochondria. Reconstituted channels showed multiple subconductance levels and were voltage-dependent, showing an increased probability of higher conductance states at voltages near zero. In symmetric 150 mM KCl, the maximal conductance of the channel ranged from 350 pS to 750 pS. For voltages >± 60 mV, conductance fluctuated {{in the range of}} ∼ 50 –∼ 200 pS. In the presence of a 1 : 3 gradient of KCl, at pH= 7. 4, selectivity periodically switched between different states ranging from weakly anion-selective (Vrev ∼ − 15 mV) to ideally cation-selective (Vrev ∼ + 29 mV), without a significant change in its conductance. Overall, the diverse, but highly reproducible, channel activity most closely resembled the behavior of the permeability transition pore channel seen in patch-clamp experiments on native mitoplasts.

This paper presents a novel ion doping method applied in <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> (CPP) -based bioceramic scaffolds substituted by potassium and strontium ions (K/Sr) to form (K/Sr–CPP) scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration. The microstructure and crystallization of the scaffolds were detected by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. Compressive strength and degradation tests were assessed to evaluate the mechanical and chemical stabilities of K/Sr–CPP in vitro. The cell biocompatibility was measured with respect to the cytotoxicity of the extractions of scaffolds. Muscle pouches and bone implantation were performed to evaluate the biodegradability and osteoconductivity of the scaffolds. The results indicated that the obtained K/Sr–CPP scaffolds had a single beta-CPP phase. The unit cell volume and average grain size increased but the crystallization decreased after the ions were doped into the CPP structure. The K/Sr–CPP scaffolds yielded a higher compressive strength and a better degradation property than the pure CPP scaffold.

To resolve these problems, au-tografts and allografts have long been used to fill bone defects caused by surgery, trauma or disease. 3 Autografts have the ad-vantage of being biocompatible, osteoconductive and osteoin-ductive. These tissue grafts require additional surgery, which can cause trauma and donor site morbidity that leads to an in-crease in surgical time and hospital costs. 4 Allografts overcome these problems, but can potentially introduce the risk of trans-mission infection or provoke an immunogenic response.

40|$|In recent years, a new {{generation}} of biodegradable metallic materials, magnesium alloys, has been called a revolutionary material for biomedical applications (i. e. in orthopedics applications as a bone-implant material), thanks to the reasonable strength (similar to bone tissue, compared to available metallic alloys) and high biocompatibility of magnesium and its alloys. However, pure magnesium can corrode too quickly in the physiological pH (7. 4 – 7. 6) and high chloride environment of the physiological system and therefore lose their mechanical integrity before tissues have sufficiently. Engineering approach to this challenge (high corrosion rate of Mg) can be (i) alloying of element additions, (ii) surface treatment and (iii) development of metal (magnesium) matrix composites (MMCs). Magnesium-based composites, as bio-materials, can provide a combination of unique characteristics including adjustable mechanical properties (i. e. tensile strength, elastic modulus, ductility) and corrosion resistance. This is the main advantage of magnesium-based composites as compared with alloying and surface treatment approaches. Here, the matrix materials are biomedical magnesium alloys based on Mg–Zn, Mg–Ca and Mg–REE alloy systems (REE stands for rare earth elements including yttrium, Y, cerium, Ce, lanthanum, La).

The composition, location, and putative structure of the polymer salt complexes led Reusch and Sadoff (1988) to propose that the complexes function as Ca 2 + channels. Here we use bilayer patch-clamp techniques to demonstrate that voltage-activated Ca 2 + channels composed of PHB and CaPPi are in the plasma membranes of E. coli. Single channel calcium currents were observed in vesicles of plasma membranes incorporated into planar bilayers of synthetic 1 -palmitoyl, 2 -oleoyl phosphatidylcholine. The channels were extracted from cells and incorporated into bilayers, where they displayed many of the signal characteristics of protein Ca 2 + channels: voltage-activated selective for divalent over monovalent cations, permeant to Ca 2 +, manner by La 3 +, Co 2 +, Cd 2 +, and Mg 2 +, in that order.

MethodsWe succeeded to fabricate three-dimensional (3 D) electrospun poly(D,l-lactide) (PLA) fiber mats into which nanospheres, formed from amorphous <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> (polyP) nanoparticles (NP) and encapsulated retinol (“retinol/aCa-polyP-NS” nanospheres [NS]), had been incorporated. ResultsExperiments with MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells revealed that co-incubation {{of the cells}} with Ca-polyP together with retinol (or incubation with retinol/aCa-polyP-NS) resulted in a significant synergistic effect on cell growth compared with particle-free polyP complexed with Ca 2 + or amorphous Ca-polyP NPs and retinol alone. Incubation of the cells {{in the presence of}} the retinol/aCa-polyP NSs also caused a significant increase of the expression levels of the genes encoding for the fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP 4), as well as of the genes encoding for leptin and the leptin receptor. In contrast, the single components, soluble Na-polyP, complexed to Ca 2 +, or retinol-free aCa-polyP NPs, and retinol, had no significant effect on the expression of these genes. ConclusionsThese results indicate that the PLA fibers, supplemented with aCa-polyP-NP or retinol/aCa-polyP-NS, elicit morphogenetic activity, suggesting that these fiber mats, along with the antibacterial effect of polyP, have a beneficial potential as wound dressings combining antimicrobial and regenerative (wound healing) properties.

Recapitulation of this architectural feature should serve to resist the constant shear force from {{the movement of the}} joint and prevent the delamination of tissue-engineered cartilage. Previous approaches to create the ZCC at the cartilage–substrate interface have relied on strategic use of exogenous scaffolds and adhesives, which are susceptible to failure by degradation and wear. In contrast, we report a successful scaffold-free engineering of ZCC to integrate tissue-engineered cartilage and a porous biodegradable bone substitute, using sheep bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) as the cell source for both cartilaginous zones. DesignBMSCs were predifferentiated to chondrocytes, harvested and then grown on a porous <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> substrate in the presence of triiodothyronine (T 3). T 3 was withdrawn, and additional predifferentiated chondrocytes were placed on top of the construct and grown for 21 days. ResultsThis protocol yielded two distinct zones: hyaline cartilage that accumulated proteoglycans and collagen type II, and calcified cartilage adjacent to the substrate that additionally accumulated mineral and collagen type X. Constructs with the calcified interface had comparable compressive strength to native sheep osteochondral tissue and higher interfacial shear strength compared to control without a calcified zone. ConclusionThis protocol improves on the existing scaffold-free approaches to cartilage tissue engineering by incorporating a calcified zone.

Among methods employed for the reduction of scale-formation is the use of certain substances which inhibit the crystallization of scale-forming materials. The present study is an investigation of some of the factors involved in the inhibition of crystallization from supersaturated solutions. The crystallization of CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O, both seeded and unseeded, from solutions containing sodium chloride and sodium tripolyphosphate, has been studied {{as a function of the}} supersaturation and of the concentration of polyphosphate additive. The processes occurring have been monitored by following the concentrations of <b>calcium</b> and <b>polyphosphate</b> species in solution with time, using compleximetric and colorimetric analysis. Both in the seeded and unseeded crystallization, the presence of polyphosphate led to the inhibition of crystallization. Induction periods have been shown to be logarithmically related to supersaturation and additive concentration and in the seeded case to be dependent on the mass of seed crystals for small amounts of seed. The interaction between tripolyphosphate in solution and calcium sulphate dihydrate has been studied by measurements of concentration loss from solution and the take-up of polyphosphate shown to involve processes other than simple sorption. In contrast with sorption of polyphosphates by less soluble adsorbents, such as barium or strontium sulphates, the take-up by calcium sulphate dihydrate is suggested to involve in initiation of the deposition of a substance containing <b>calcium</b> and <b>polyphosphate</b> on to the crystals.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to further reduce the machining cycle time for producing <b>Calcium</b> <b>Polyphosphate</b> (CPP) implant constructs. To achieve this, the impregnation of the CPP lattice with various polymers is investigated, {{with the aim of}} improving the toughness of the material. By applying Taguchi’s orthogonal array method it was determined that CPP infiltrated with an ionic bonding polymer produces the best material for generating high quality machined surfaces and features. While there is some loss in surface porosity, in comparison to cutting uninfiltrated CPP, the porosity loss was deemed acceptable for the clinical purpose of the implant, and in many cases, would be trimmed off during a consecutive finish machining operation. The 2 fluted 4 mm diameter flat end mill at a cutting speed of 30 m/min and ¾ immersion up-milling, 0. 1 mm chip load and 3 mm depth of cut were determined to be highly suitable for achieving both high productivity as well as excellent surface integrity. These conditions produced a material removal rate of 4, 302 mm 3 /min, which was 14 times higher than the material removal rate achieved in machining pure CPP in earlier studies. The constructed machining model was highly successful in predicting the cutting forces, and therefore can be used in process planning and optimization in the production of tissue engineered implant constructs out of CPP. The Finite Element analyses predicted that the implant would not chip or break during the roughing operation, as validated experimentally. This allowed the roughing cycle time to be reduced from 159 min to 19 min, effectively achieving a productivity improvement of 8 times over the earlier work done in this area...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the use of}} Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machining as a method to manufacture anatomically-shaped synthetic grafts made from <b>Calcium</b> <b>Polyphosphate</b> (CPP) ceramic. Tissue-engineered cartilage is grown {{on the surface of}} these implants in vitro followed by in vivo implantation in the host’s body for osteochondral focal defect repair. While most current implants are manufactured from simple geometries and are not specific to one patient’s need, it is believed that custom manufactured implants (from computer tomography data) representing the exact shape of the original bone will be beneficial. This is because custom implants permit an even stress distribution on the cartilage, resulting in increased cartilage survival rates. The present study has successfully manufactured and delivered a custom designed implant with sufficient surface porosity and minimal chipping. This was accomplished by effectively modeling the machinability characteristics and finding the optimal cutting conditions for CPP. CPP’s machinability characteristics were investigated and a cutting force prediction model was developed. This model was verified by a comparison of experimental and predicted forces for a number of ball and flat endmilling tests. The optimal cutting conditions that would result in maximum surface porosity and minimal chipping were established through qualitative investigation of results from varied conditions using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images. Using the established optimal cutting conditions from machinability studies, the multi-axis machining process for producing the designed custom implant was developed and all stages were simulated for accuracy and integrity of the final implant. The designed toolpaths were tested on prototyping wax and verified against the actual Computer Aided Design (CAD) model using an optical microscope. The same toolpaths were executed on a block of CPP and the final implant was again investigated for surface porosity and chipping.

This 3 D dynamic cell culture was better mimic the physiological condition for cell growth. It was beneficial to nutrition and oxygen delivery throughout the whole scaffold {{and was able to}} form shear stress. We wanted to investigate the effect of the gradient structure on murine MC 3 T 3 cells 2 ̆ 7 behavior after dynamic cell culture. We hypothesize that the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of osteogenic cells on gradient scaffolds are significantly enhanced, compared to that in homogenous scaffold. The porosity, degradation rate and mechanical properties of gradient and homogenous scaffolds had been investigated. The total porous volume and degradation rate were similar between two scaffolds. While pore size and porosity on 1 st and 2 nd layer of the gradient scaffold were higher than the homogenous scaffold, which resulted in the mechanical strength of homogenous scaffolds was higher than gradient one. The cell proliferation (MTT method), cell distribution (confocal microscopy) and cell differentiation (Alkaline phosphatase activity) were measured. Although the level of cell proliferation on two kinds of scaffolds was similar, cell distribution and the level of cell differentiation were different between two scaffolds. On the gradient scaffold, the level of cell differentiation was two times higher than the homogenous scaffold. In order to investigate the function of each layer on the gradient scaffold, micro-PET technology was applied. The PET image showed that the majority of new forming HA was distributed on the 1 st and 2 nd layer of gradient scaffold. Also tetracycline labeling study showed the crystal structure of HA from the gradient scaffold. Therefore, the gradient scaffold with four functional layers (1 st and 2 nd for cell growth, 3 rd and 4 th for providing mechanical strength) did affect the cells 2 ̆ 7 distribution and enhance the cells 2 ̆ 7 differentiated which was beneficial for new bone forming...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is {{on the development of}} a solid freeform fabrication (SFF) process for the design and manufacture of porous biodegradable orthopaedic implants from <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> (CPP). Porous CPP structures are used as bone substitutes for regenerating bone defects and/or as substrates in formation of so-called “biphasic” implants for repair of damaged osteochondral tissues. The CPP implants can be utilized in the treatment of many musculoskeletal diseases, osteochondral defects, and bone tumours while replacement of the defect site is required. In this study, the fabrication of CPP structures was developed through a powder-based SFF technique known as adhesive bonding 3 D-printing. SFF is an advanced alternative to the “conventional” fabrication method consisting of gravity sintering of CPP pre-forms followed by machining to final form, as SFF enables rapid manufacturing of complex-shaped bio-structures with controlled internal architecture. To address the physical and structural properties of the porous SFF-made components, they were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, micro-CT scanning and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Specific surface area and permeability of the porous structures were also determined. Additionally, the chemical properties (crystallinity) of the specimens were identified by X-ray diffraction. The mechanical properties of the crystalline CPP material were also measured by micro- and nano-indentation. Moreover, the porous structures were tested by uniaxial and diametral mechanical compression to determine the compressive and tensile strengths, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of the stacked-layer orientation on the mechanical properties of the SFF-made constructs was investigated through the production of samples with horizontal or vertical stacked-layers. The properties of the SFF-made samples were compared with those of the conventionally-made CPP constructs. The SFF-made implants showed drastically higher compressive mechanical strength compared to the conventionally-formed samples with identical porosity. It was also shown that the orientation of the stacked-layer has substantial influence on the mechanical strengths. Moreover, this thesis examined the ability of in vitro forming of cartilaginous tissue on the SFF-made substrates where the chondrocytes cellular response to the CPP implants was evaluated histologically and biochemically. In addition, an initial in vivo assessment of the CPP structures as bone substitutes was conducted using a rabbit medial femoral site model. Significant amount of new-bone was formed within the CPP porous constructs during the 6 -week implantation period demonstrating appropriate biological response of SFF-made CPP structures for bone substitute applications. Another accomplishment of this thesis was the development of a mathematical model which predicts the compact density of powder layers spread by a counter-rotating roller in the SFF technique. The results may be used in the control of the apparent density of the final implant. The potential of the developed SFF method as an efficient and reproducible technique for the production of porous CPP structures for use in orthopaedics and musculoskeletal tissue regenerative applications was concluded...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is on the additive manufacturing (AM) of a porous biodegradable scaffold using a fine <b>Calcium</b> <b>Polyphosphate</b> (CPP) powder, {{with the aid of}} sacrificial porogens. CPP is a member of Calcium Phosphate (CaP) bioceramic family which has shown great potential in bone tissue engineering over the past years. AM processes are fairly new technologies that have been involve in many different industries and applications, including bone tissue engineering. Not too long ago, CPP was investigated using a powder based 3 D printing technique, which is an AM process, and it was revealed that this new manufacturing process offers a great potential in improving previous finding made by traditional fabrication techniques. Over the past few years there have been many different studies on 3 D printing CPP substrate, but almost all of those studies were based on using a large particle CPP powder. In this study, the fabrication of CPP structures was based on using a fine CPP powder with a particle size of < 75 µm. 3 D printing fine dry powder has one main challenge which is flowability of the powder, and in this study a new solution has been suggested to improve the flow behavior of the fine CPP powder. Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) powder with a particle size of 75 - 106 µm was chosen as the large sacrificial particles so called porogens, to be mixed with fine CPP powder to improve the flowability. In order to improve the flow behavior of the powder in the AM process, various percentages of porogens were mixed with the fine CPP powder to fine the appropriate dosage. Furthermore, there were two different liquid binders tested in the AM process. After CPP parts were fabricated, all specimens were measured in dimensions before and after the sintering. The dimensional measurements were used to determine the shrinkage percentage. Then the sintered parts had to be tested one by one through Archimedes method to find the porosity percentage corresponding to each individual sample. Following that, uniaxial compression test was applied to evaluate the mechanical strength of each specimen. In order to look at the micro structures of samples and making sure the particle have formed good bonding/sinter necks, random specimens were chosen to me examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Moreover, different powders were sent to an external facility to be tested for the flow behavior and the average particle size by using a rheometer and a laser diffraction method, respectively. The results were analyzed for different categories based on the pre mixed porogens percentage. It was proven that adding porogens definitely improves the flowability of the fine powder; it also increases the shrinkage percentage of samples. Then the results were compared with previous findings that were based on using a large particle CPP powder; it was shown that some of those previous finding obtain by 3 D printing large particle CPP powder, can be achieved by doing the same using the fine CPP powder. Furthermore, a new higher compressive strength was reported in this study that was not achieved in previous reports which was based on the large particle CPP powder...|$|R

Three commercial deflocculants were used: trisodium orthophosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium <b>polyphosphate,</b> <b>Calcium</b> carbonate aqueous suspensions were prepared at various solid volume fractions (0. 270 to 0. 382). Rheological tests were carried out at 25 °C by using the rate controlled coaxial cylinder viscometer Rotovisko-Haake 20, system M 5 -osc., measuring device MV 1 P with serrated surfaces. The tests were performed under both continuous and oscillatory flow conditions. All the suspensions prepared without deflocculant show a rheological behavior of the shearthinning type; good correlations between relative viscosity and shear rate data were found by applying the Quemada model.

In this article, <b>calcium</b> based inorganic <b>polyphosphate</b> (CPP) bioceramics were synthesized by gravity sintering. Effects of the sintering time (30 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours and 5 hours) on the microstructure, physicochemical degradation and mechanical property were investigated. It was found that all prepared CPP samples for various sintering times showed a β-CPP phase at the temperature of 800 ºC. The sample morphology changed to more compact with extending the sintering time from 30 minutes to 5 hours. Moreover, the grain size increased with the increase of sintering time, from 1. 59 μm for 30 minutes to 3. 40 μm for 5 hours. The in vitro degradation test revealed that the degradation velocity had an inverse relationship with the sintering time. The CPP samples sintering for 30 minutes showed the fastest degradation, while CPP sintering for 5 hours was the slowest one. Compression test results showed that longer sintering times led to improved mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to develop {{techniques}} for manufacturing anatomically-shaped substrates of implants made from <b>calcium</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> (CPP) ceramic. These substrates have tissue-engineered cartilage growing on their top surfaces and can be used as implants for osteochondral focal defect repair. While many research groups have been fabricating such substrates using standard material shapes, e. g., rectangles and circular discs, it is considered beneficial to develop methods that can be integrated in the substrate fabrication process to produce an implant that is specific to a patient’s own anatomy (as obtained from computer tomography data) to avoid uneven and/or elevated stress distribution that can affect the survival of cartilage. The custom-made, porous CPP substrates were fabricated with three-dimensional printing (3 DP) and computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining for the first time to the best of the author’s knowledge. The 3 DP technique was employed in two routines: indirect- and direct- 3 DP. In the former, 3 DP was used to fabricate molds for pre-shaping of the CPP substrates from two different powder size ranges (< 75 μm and 106 - 150 μm). In the latter, CPP substrates were produced directly from the retrofitted 3 DP apparatus in a layer-by-layer fashion from 45 - 75 μm CPP powder with a polymeric binder. The prototyped samples were then sintered to obtain the required porosity and mechanical properties. These substrates were characterized in terms of their dimensional shrinkage and density. Also, SEM images were used to assess the particle distribution and neck and bond formations. The substrates produced using the indirect- 3 DP method yielded densities (< 75 μm: 66. 28 ± 11. 62 % and 106 - 150 μm: 65. 87 ± 6. 12 %), which were comparable to the substrates used currently and with some success in animal studies. Geometric adjustment factors were devised to compensate for the slight expansion inherent in the 3 DP mold fabricating process. These equations were used to bring the plaster molds into true dimension. The direct- 3 DP method has proven to be the ultimate choice due to its ability to produce complex anatomically-shaped substrates without the use of a chemical solvent. In addition, it allows for precise control of both pore size and internal architectures of the substrates. Thus, the direct- 3 DP was considered to be superior than the indirect- 3 DP as a fabrication method. In the alternative CNC machining approach to fabrication, the ability to machine the CPP ceramic was feasible and by careful selection of the machining conditions, anatomically-shaped CPP substrates were produced. To develop strategies for optimizing the machining process, a mechanistic model was developed based on curve fitting the average cutting forces to determine the cutting coefficients for CPP. These cutting coefficients were functions of workpiece material, axial depth of cut, chip width, and cutter geometry. To explore the utility of this modelling approach, cutting forces were predicted for a helical ball-end mill and compared with experimental results. The cutting force simulation exhibits good agreement in predicting the fundamental force magnitude and general shape of the actual forces. However, there were some discrepancies between the predicted and measured forces. These differences were attributed to internal microstructure defects, density gradients, and the use of a shear plane model in force prediction that was not entirely appropriate for brittle materials such as CPP. The present study successfully developed 3 DP and CNC fabrication methods for manufacturing anatomically-shaped CPP substrates. Future studies were recommended to explore further optimization of these fabrication methods and to demonstrate the utility of accurate substrates shapes to the clinical application of focal defect repair implants...|$|R
