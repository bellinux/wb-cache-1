25|$|The Board's {{operations}} briefly {{became the}} responsibility of the Christchurch City Council before being transferred to a new company, Christchurch Transport Limited. The regional council introduced a <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> system in early 1991 for which Christchurch Transport was one of several bidders. The last vestiges of the Board's monopoly position disappeared when the deregulated transport market took effect from 1 July 1991.|$|E

5000|$|In August 2016, a new {{renewable}} energy law was approved {{that aims to}} further stimulate renewable energy investments by introducing feed-in premiums, <b>competitive</b> <b>tenders</b> and virtual net metering. Under the new law, the compensation for renewable energy producers will consist of what they receive in the electricity market plus a variable feed-in premium. The latter {{is the difference between}} a price depending on market variables (e.g., the system’s marginal price) and a set price decided via a <b>competitive</b> <b>tender.</b> Furthermore, from the beginning of 2017, the new scheme to approve {{new renewable}} energy capacity is based on <b>competitive</b> <b>tenders,</b> where the Energy Minister is able to call on a tender for specific capacities and technologies.|$|R

2500|$|The concept {{outlined}} {{in the book is}} not simply one of urban planning, but also included a system of community management. For example, the Garden City project would be financed through a system that Howard called [...] "Rate-Rent", which combined financing for community services (rates) with a return for those who had invested {{in the development of the}} City (rent). The book also advocated a rudimentary form of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering,</b> whereby the municipality would purchase services, such as water, fuel, waste disposal, etc., from (often local) commercial providers. These systems were never fully implemented, in Letchworth, Welwyn or their numerous imitators.|$|E
2500|$|The {{same year}} {{the company was}} given the {{contract}} for the Garabit viaduct, a railway bridge near Ruynes en Margeride in the Cantal département. Like the Douro bridge, the project involved a lengthy viaduct crossing the river valley {{as well as the}} river itself, and Eiffel was given the job without any process of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> due to his success with the bridge over the Douro. [...] To assist him in the work he took on several people who were to play important roles in the design and construction of the Eiffel Tower, including Maurice Koechlin, a young graduate of the Zurich Polytechnikum, who was engaged to undertake calculations and make drawings, and Émile Nouguier, who had previously worked for Eiffel on the construction of the Douro bridge.|$|E

The transaction was originally quoted at 6 million euros from François Charles Oberthur of Paris (a supplier of Visa and MasterCards) but was awarded to a British firm, the Anglo-Leasing and Finance Company Limited, at 30 million euros, who would have sub-contracted the same French firm to do the work. Despite the lack of <b>competitive</b> <b>tendering</b> Anglo Leasing was paid a [...] "commitment fee" [...] of more than £600,000. Anglo Leasing's agent is a Liverpool-based firm, Saagar Associates, owned by a woman whose family has enjoyed close links with senior officials in the Moi regime. Company records show Saagar Associates is owned by Mrs Sudha Ruparell, a 47-year-old Kenyan woman.

40|$|In {{rangeland}} areas, improved biodiversity management can {{be achieved}} by changing the financial incentives facing land managers. <b>Competitive</b> <b>tenders</b> and fixed price grants can both be applied to achieve the same environmental outcomes. In the case study described in this paper, the efficiencies of the two methods are compared. Operationally, the two mechanisms are similar in both cost and process. Both mechanisms have very important indirect benefits of building skills and knowledge in both landholders and the implementing agency, and building trust between the two. However, the heterogeneity in landholders’ opportunity costs revealed in the <b>competitive</b> <b>tender</b> trial means a discriminatory price mechanism is more efficient at matching program costs with direct environmental benefits. In terms of transfer payments, the <b>competitive</b> <b>tender</b> was 30 % more cost efficient than a fixed price grant scheme. While the initial design and development costs of a tender may be greater than a grant, {{there was no evidence of}} any difference in operating costs in this case study. There was also little evidence of any indirect costs associated with the tender process, but it may be too early to make a realistic assessment...|$|R
