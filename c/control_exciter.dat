40|$|This paper {{presents}} experiment {{results that}} examine {{the validity of}} extracting blade vibration signature from the shaft torsional vibration signals. A special test rig was designed and manufactured for this objective. A set of strain gages were bonded to the shaft and to the blades to measure the shaft twisting and blade bending deformations respectively. A <b>controlled</b> frequency <b>exciter</b> excited the blade vibration. The shaft torsional and blade bending vibration signals were simultaneously recorded and presented in the time and frequency domains. The blade bending vibration frequencies appeared dominantly in the shaft torsional vibration signals for all blade vibration frequencies up to 100 Hz. For frequencies higher than 100 Hz, less sensitivity of the torsional vibration to blade vibration was observed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the closed-loop <b>control</b> of <b>exciters</b> {{to produce a}} traveling wave in a finite beam. This control {{is based on a}} dynamical modeling of the system established in a rotating reference frame. This method allows dynamic and independent control of the phase and amplitude of two vibration modes. The condition to obtain the traveling wave is written in this rotating frame, and requires having two vibration modes with the same amplitude, and imposing a phase shift of 90 ° between them. The advantage of the method is that it allows easy implementation of a closed loop control that can handle parameter drift of the system, after a temperature rise, for example. The modeling is compared with measurement on an experimental test bench which also implements real-time control. We managed to experimentally obtain a settling time of 250 ms for the traveling wave, and a standing wave ratio (SWR) of 1. 3...|$|R

40|$|The {{resonant}} {{characteristic of}} hydraulic system {{has not been}} described yet because it is necessarily restricted by linear assumptions in classical fluid theory. A way of the resonance analysis is presented for an electrohydraulic <b>exciter</b> <b>controlled</b> by 2 D valve.

According to input energy from oil source which is equal to the reverse energy to oil source, load pressure and load flow are solved analytically as the working frequency reaches the natural frequency. The analytical expression of resonant peak is also derived without damping. Finally, the experimental system is built to verify the theoretical analysis. The initial research on resonant characteristic will lay theoretical foundation and make useful complement for resonance phenomena of classical fluid theory in hydraulic system...|$|R
40|$|With an {{ever-increasing}} pentration of wind power into power system, the influence to overall system behavior and stability becomes obviously. Therefore, {{it is so}} necessary to require wind turbines have good grid adaptability. This paper investigates the effect of directly grid-connected front-end speed controlled wind turbines (FSCWT) on transient stability of power system. For this purpose, a voltage based synchronous generator model is used and the drive train model with WinDriver is built. By using a fast excitation <b>control</b> of FSCWT <b>exciter,</b> the FSCWT wind turbines can successfully ride through grid fault and have no problem of angular stability when connected to grid. Simulation studies are carried out to demonstrate and compare the transient performance of the IEEE 5 -machine 14 -bus system with FSCWT replace by double fed induction generators (DFIG) during a three phase fault. Results show that a better transient stability performance is achieved with an intergration of FSCWT in comparsion with DFIG, which can even bring some benefits on power system transient performance and stability. <!

40|$|Voltage {{control is}} very {{important}} in electrical power system to ensure safe operating condition for equipment. The purpose of this project is to investigate the application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm in fine-tuning the Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) parameter of PID controller for Power System’s Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR). AVR system is employed widely in <b>exciter</b> <b>control</b> system, mainly used in areas where the supply voltage is not stable and fluctuation of load occurs. The generator excitation system maintains generator terminal voltage and controls the reactive power flow using an AVR. A practical high order and linearized Power System AVR is modelled with four main components namely Amplifier, Exciter, Generator and Sensor. The proposed PSO algorithm had superior computational efficiency, stable convergence characteristic, and easy implementation. Fast tuning of optimum PID controller parameters yields high quality solution. To estimate the performance of optimal PID controller, a fitness function that use frequency-domain and time-domain were defined. A conventional technique, Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) tuning technique was used as the comparison for proposed algorithm. Simulation result shows that PID tuned by ZN technique improved the transient response of AVR but due to high order of AVR system, it is difficult to achieve optimal PID of AVR using ZN technique which is achievable using PSO algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A {{synchronous}} generator may sometimes {{be able to}} withstand a large impact but it may fail to retain synchronism under a small impact due to growing oscillations, leading to instability. This is called dynamic instability. It occurs for specific operating conditions and network configurations, particularly in presence of fastacting excitation control. The paper presents techniques of small signal stability assessment of a turbo generator connected to a grid system while a small perturbation is injected externally. The infinite bus idealisation has been made as {{the capacity of the}} generator is small compared to that of the power grid. The classical model based on Park-Gorev transformation has been used to represent the machines. The current state space model has been used. The small signal stability has been assessed by examining the eigenvalues of the state matrix. Reduced order model has also been developed for the same machine including exciter parameters and the stability has been examined by applying Routh’s array on the characteristic equation.
