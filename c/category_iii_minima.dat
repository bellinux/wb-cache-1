The FAA Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) office is currently working with the industry {{in anticipation of the}} certification of the first GBAS ground stations in Memphis, TN; Sydney, Australia; Bremen, Germany; Spain; and Newark, NJ.

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to other operations, CAT <b>III</b> weather <b>minima</b> {{do not provide}} sufficient visual references to allow a manual landing to be made. CAT <b>III</b> <b>minima</b> depend on roll-out control and redundancy of the autopilot, because they give only enough time for the pilot {{to decide whether the}} aircraft will land in the touchdown zone (basically CAT IIIa) and to ensure safety during rollout (basically CAT IIIb). Therefore, an automatic landing system is mandatory to perform <b>Category</b> <b>III</b> operations. Its reliability must be sufficient to control the aircraft to touchdown in CAT IIIa operations and through rollout to a safe taxi speed in CAT IIIb (and CAT IIIc when authorized). [...] However, special approval has been granted to some operators for hand-flown CAT III approaches using a head-up display (HUD) guidance which provides the pilot with an image viewed through the windshield with eyes focused at infinity, of necessary electronic guidance to land the airplane with no true outside visual references.|$|R
