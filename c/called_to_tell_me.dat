[...] Likewise, former showrunner Glen Mazzara said, [...] "I told her that and then we came up with a better plan that was that if T-Dog had saved her, if T-Dog sacrificed his life we felt that that sacrifice was only worthwhile if Carol lived. But we didn’t want to reveal that Carol was alive {{at the end of that}} episode because we were really going with the devastation of Lori’s death.

[...] He then expressed praise over Carol's survival saying, [...] "I will say that I think McBride has done a great job with Carol this season, the character has become a fan favorite, the character has really come along, she takes a lot of risks and Carol’s work when she sees the baby and then realizes that Lori hasn’t made it is one of the best scenes we have done all year and I give credit for that to Melissa and she is just a fantastic actress." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 2007, just weeks before my college graduation, my parents <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that my {{grandmother}} was sick. I was worried to hear {{that she was in}} the hospital, but like the rest of my family, I had little doubt that she’d be better in no time. At a spry 82 years, my grandmother was the picture of health. She was a nonsmoker, a nondrinker, and had had no medical problems except for mild asthma. A world traveler, avid gardener, and savvy businesswoman, she has been known to do her grocery shopping, attend a bank board meeting, talk her way out of a speeding ticket, and rearrange the living room furniture all in time to prepare dinner for 12 and cut fresh roses for the table. As a loving wife, mother of 5, and grandmother of 10, she is the family matriarch and holds us together in a way I never fully appreciated until that familiar structure was suddenly threatened. My grandmother’s illness began with acute onset of abdominal cramps and watery, nonbloody diarrhea followed by nausea and vomiting. She had no fever. The diarrhea continued intermittently through the first day and night of her illness, and by the second day, when the diarrhea became grossly bloody, her internist had her admitted to a community hospital. At the time of admission, she was normotensive and still afebrile. Physical examination findings were unremarkable except for mild bilateral lower abdominal tenderness. The leukocyte count was mildly elevated at 13, 500 cells/ μL, hemoglobin was within normal limits at 15. 0 g/dL, and the platelet count was 263, 000 cells/μL. Electrolytes were within normal limits, blood urea nitrogen was mildly elevated at 19 mg/dL, and creatinine was within normal limits at 0. 7 mg/dL. Urinalysis findings were also within normal limits.

This morning I went out and cleaned the garage so that I could drive in the car. I had planned on doing just that today before the heavy cold comes. Well, Nature beat me to it [...] we had a violent rainstorm last night and snow flurries today. I started to drive the car into the garage and the “G, D, *## [...] !!++ 11 ” wouldn’t start. I pushed the starter and exactly nothing happened [...] not a sound issued forth. I called the garage man who had the “nerve” to charge Dad 104 for fixing up the car and told him exactly what I thought abut “his fixing,” but he put me in my place, I guess, by telling me that he didn’t do anything to the battery and that perhaps a cell was dead. I had the car recharged (I mean the battery) right after he started it for me Wednesday night. He wasn’t equipped to do that. To {{make a long story}} short, I guess I’ll have to haul it into a garage around here for another seige [sic]. I’m so mad at that damm [sic] car, I feel like “splitting a gut!!” Since the weather was damm [sic] louse [sic] as only Cleveland weather can be, I thought I would stay at home and accomplish a few things I had been putting off; but Doris Shapiro <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that Gussie Allenick had told her (because a neighbor lady had called Gussie to tell her the news), that Alice Pevsner’s mother passed away Saturday morning, and Alice arrived from Dayton late Saturday night. It was an extreme shock to everyone concerned since Mrs. had rallied from her operation (a year ago) very, very successfully. Well, I went over to see Alice and her father in the late afternoon. Thank goodness that they made no display of emotion, although I can certainly vouch for {{the fact that they were}} both very badly upset! By the way, did you know that Gussie Allenick’s mother is slowly dying of cancer? Pretty tragic, huh? Darling, if you have a minute to spare, drop Alice a line. Her address in Shaker Hts. is 2949 S. Moreland Blvd. They have a suite in the new apt. [building?] that is on S. Moreland between Shaker Sq. and S. Woodland. It is a lovely apt. and her father intends to keep it regardless of what Alice does. As yet, Alice is undecided whether to stay in Dayton or come home and be with her father. Gussie and Alice seemed very, very close. Oh yes, I think I’ll buy a fruit cake or something and bring it over some night this week when I go over there. Also, I plan to buy a card and send it to Nanny, since she lost a daughter [...] a Mrs. Shapiro. However, I don’t know if it is proper to send her a card, and not send a card to Ann 2 ̆ 6 Dick and also a card to Lolly, although the latter members mentioned don’t seem to be too upset by the death. As soon as I finish this letter to you, I plan to drop an air mail letter to Lt. Amster, 909 th F. A. Bn. and to Capt. Shaw, 327 th F. A. Bn. Hope they reach the boys. I brought Grandmother over to the house and she plans to stay overnight. You should see the fuss she made when Sadie told her she could stay over here for awhile. She has simply made up her mind to die in Sadie’s house and that is all there’s to it, and of course, she is forever dying. Outside of that everything is running as usual [...] I’m typing my daily letter to you, Uk is first starting to take a shower, so, as usual will get into bed about 11 p. m., and Mom and Dad just had a “fuss” because Dad went to play pinchole [sic]. My love for you still burns madly on [...] I adore you my darling. You’re the finest man I could ask for! Hope that tomorrow brings me a stack of mail from you. That’s the only reason I’ll be glad to see Monday. I hope that you are taking good care of yourself and keeping up your weight. Honey, today when I weighed myself with my clothes on, I found I weigh 132 lbs. Before I started on the diet (it’ll be two weeks this Friday) I weighed 138 lbs. with clothes on, so I think I’m doing darn good and I may have a streamline figure when you get home.

40|$|HARVEST SONGS AND ELEGIAC NOTES 2 ̆ 2 Writing {{about living}} subjects, {{especially}} those with whom one feels political and personal solidarity, is a touchy, even painful business, 2 ̆ 2 begins Constance Coiner {{in the introduction to}} her book on Tillie Olsen and Meridel Le Sueur. Contemporary directions in scholarship have recognized that interaction and opened up the personal voice in the scholarly study. Putting aside the dream of disinterestedness, the scholar herself may become part of the subject. The traditions of an objective scholarship are especially hard to fulfill, even to honor, when the research is done in cooperation with a living author who offers feminist support and friendship along with unpublished manuscripts and personal interviews. Much of the scholarly study of Tillie Olsen and Meridel Le Sueur reflects the personal relationship of the critic with the writer, a similar political commitment, and an enthusiasm for the writer 2 ̆ 7 s work. The scholar hopes to please the author because of friendship and because she {{wants to be able to}} continue talking with her for future research. The author, pleased with the scholarly attention to her work after long years of neglect, wants to respond positively to what interests the scholar. The pull of personal and practical considerations can shape the project in unacknowledged ways. This painful business of writing about living authors extends beyond the connection between artist and scholar to include the network of scholars who write about the same living authors. We know of each other, we know our subjects, and we know how our subjects work with us to reveal, release, and sometimes control what we can say and how much we can learn. In the cases of Le Sueur and Olsen, we are further bound by the gift of an extraordinary warmth and grace emanating from the authors, an affectionate interest in ourselves and our work that translates feminist ideals into friendship. In this network of associations, even a review partakes of the personal in ways that influence judgments about the work. In the months after this review was commissioned, both Constance Coiner and Meridel Le Sueur died. Coiner was killed tragically, in the company of her young daughter, in the explosion of TWA Flight 800. Le Sueur died last winter at age 97, worn down at last by the adversities of her age, but within the circle of her family and community around St. Paul, her home for so many years. I heard about her death in a way that closes this circle of connections around me. Sitting at my desk one winter morning, I answered the phone: it was Tillie Olsen. She was <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that Meridel had died. Tillie didn 2 ̆ 7 t want me to read it cold in the impersonality of a newspaper account. I knew that Tillie had been devastated a few months before by the news of the TWA disaster. From within this circle of rich associations where knowledge is conditioned by sorrow and affection, there remained the 2 ̆ 2 painful business 2 ̆ 2 of writing a review. The two books under review take as their ground the political life of their subjects. Since that life centered on the Communist Party USA, the focus of their studies poses yet another related problem.
