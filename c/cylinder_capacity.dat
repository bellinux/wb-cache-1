5|$|The {{nominal volume}} of gas stored is {{commonly}} quoted as the <b>cylinder</b> <b>capacity</b> in the USA. It {{is a measure}} of the volume of gas that can be released from the full cylinder at atmospheric pressure. Terms used for the capacity include 'free gas volume' or 'free gas equivalent'. It depends on the internal volume and the working pressure of a cylinder. If the working pressure is higher, the cylinder will store more gas for the same volume.|$|E

For example, for internal combustion engines, single and two-cylinder designs are common in smaller vehicles such as motorcycles, while automobiles typically have between four and eight, and locomotives, and ships may have a dozen cylinders or more. <b>Cylinder</b> <b>capacities</b> may range from 10 cm³ or less in model engines up to thousands of liters in ships' engines.|$|R

25|$|The first models, known generically as the T300s, {{all used}} a common piston {{diameter}} (76mm) {{in a common}} wet cylinder liner. Basic engine variations were achieved {{through the use of}} two specifications of piston stroke: 65mm to create individual <b>cylinder</b> <b>capacity</b> of 300cc, and 55mm to create a 250cc individual cylinder. Two 750cc models were released – and the Daytona and Trident 750 triples (3 x 250cc). There was one 1000cc model – the Daytona 1000 four (4 x 250cc). Two 900cc models were the Trophy 900 and Trident 900 triples (3 x 300cc). The Trophy 1200 four was the largest model (4 x 300cc). All were remarkably smooth running. The three cylinder models were equipped with a contra-rotating balance shaft mounted {{at the front of the}} engine. The four cylinder models benefitted from twin balance shafts – unique at the time – mounted beneath the crank shaft. Contemporary road tests noted the solidity and smoothness of performance as positives but the weight of the machines as negatives. For brand new machines produced by a totally new concern, there were remarkably few early problems. These were an insecure oil pressure switch and a longer-lived problem with the starter (or sprag clutch). The cosmetic finish on the first machines was simple and not very robust. Revisions to crankcases for the three-cylinder models in 1993, together with a move to high pressure casting, reduced engine weight considerably. All painting and plating operations were brought in house in 1993, as the Hinckley factory benefitted from further investment after the initial success of the range. The result was improved quality and durability of finish, added to the basic engineering integrity of the engine and chassis, made for a long-lasting and robust motorcycle.|$|E

2500|$|Configuration [...] In a pony bottle {{system the}} back-up {{regulator}} {{is a complete}} diving regulator (first and second stages, and usually a submersible pressure gauge) on a separate cylinder which is not intended for use as primary breathing gas during the dive.

It should however provide enough breathing gas to make a totally controlled return to the surface, including any required decompression stop or safety stop planned for the ascent.

Traditionally, <b>cylinder’s</b> <b>capacity,</b> rotation frequency, average efficient pressure inside cylinder, piston’s stroke, average piston’s velocity, fuel specific consumption and other indices are used as generalizing criteria, characterizing diesel engine’s efficiency, but they do not reflect interrelation between engine’s complex efficiency and a set of economic, mass-dimensional, operational and ecological efficiency. The approach applied in the article makes it possible to reveal the existing and modify the existing methods of solving the problem of improving diesel engine’s efficiency with due regard to interrelation of the parameters, characterizing efficiency of their operation. Statistic analyses were carried out, on the basis of which an assumption regarding the existence of interrelation between specific fuel consumption and the analyzed engine’s parameters was made. Processing of statistical data for various analyzed functions of diesel engines helped offer a function, illustrating the link between volume combustion rate, piston’s area and nominal theoretical specific fuel consumption. Interrelation between volume combustion rate, nominal parameters of diesel operation and efficiency indices, obtained by processing statistical data of more than 500 models of diesels of different series was evaluated, the main feature of it being a mathematical trend.
