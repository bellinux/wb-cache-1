6000|$|But Diderot {{knew well}} enough that Chardin's kindly {{principle}} might easily be carried too far. In general, he said, criticism displeases me; it supposes so little talent. [...] "What a foolish occupation, that of incessantly hindering ourselves from taking pleasure, or else making ourselves blush {{for the pleasure}} that we have taken! And that is the occupation of criticism!"[37] Yet in one case he writes a score of pages of <b>critical</b> <b>dialogue,</b> in which the chief interlocutor is a painter who avenges his own failure by stringent attacks {{on the work of}} happier rivals of the year. And speaking in his own proper person, Diderot knows how to dismiss incompetence with the right word, sometimes of scorn, more often of good-natured remonstrance. Bad painters, a Parrocel, a Brenet, fare as ill at his hands as they deserved to do. He remarks incidentally that the condition of the bad painter and the bad actor is worse than that of the bad man of letters: the painter hears with his own ears the expressions of contempt for his talent, and the hisses of the audience go straight to the ears of the actor, whereas the author has the comfort of going to his grave without a suspicion that you have cried out at every page: [...] "The fool, the animal, the jackass!" [...] and have at length flung his book into a corner. There is nothing to prevent the worst author, as he sits alone in his library, and reads himself over and over again, from congratulating himself on being the originator of a host of rare and felicitous ideas.[38] ...|$|E
