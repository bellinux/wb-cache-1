50|$|Diazinon is a <b>contact</b> <b>insecticide</b> which kills insects by {{altering}} normal neurotransmission within {{the nervous system}} of the insect. As mentioned above, diazinon inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in cholinergic synapses and neuromuscular junctions. This results in abnormal accumulation of ACh within the nervous system. Diazinon, although a thiophosphoric ester, shares a common mechanism of toxicity with other organophosphate insecticides such as chlorpyrifos, malathion and parathion, and is not very effective against the organophosphate-resistant insect populations.|$|E

For two populations of T. castaneum from Nikinci and Jakovo LD values, ld-p lines and levels of susceptibility/resistance (RRs) were determined. The most toxic insecticide for adults from Nikinci and Jakovo was deltamethrin, while malathion was least toxic.

40|$|Abstract Background Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor {{residual}} sprays (IRS) have decimated malaria transmission {{by killing}} indoor-feeding mosquitoes. However, complete elimination of malaria transmission with these proven methods is confounded by vectors that evade pesticide contact by feeding outdoors. Methods For any assumed level of indoor coverage and personal protective efficacy with insecticidal products, process-explicit malaria transmission models suggest that insecticides that repel mosquitoes will achieve less impact upon transmission {{than those that}} kill them outright. Here such models are extended to explore how outdoor use of products containing either contact toxins or spatial repellents might augment or attenuate impact of high indoor coverage of LLINs relying primarily upon contact toxicity. Results LLIN impact could be dramatically enhanced by high coverage with spatial repellents conferring near-complete personal protection, but only if combined indoor use of both measures can be avoided where vectors persist that prefer feeding indoors upon humans. While very high levels of coverage and efficacy will be required for spatial repellents to substantially augment the impact of LLINs or IRS, these ambitious targets may well {{be at least as}} practically achievable as the lower requirements for equivalent impact using <b>contact</b> <b>insecticides.</b> Conclusions Vapour-phase repellents may be more acceptable, practical and effective than <b>contact</b> <b>insecticides</b> for preventing outdoor malaria transmission because they need not be applied to skin or clothing and may protect multiple occupants of spaces outside of treatable structures such as nets or houses. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{summarize}} the economic importance, biology, {{and management of}} soft scales, focusing on pests of agricultural, horti-cultural, and silvicultural crops in outdoor production systems and urban landscapes. We also provide summaries on voltinism, crawler emergence timing, and predictive models for crawler emergence to assist in developing soft scale management programs. Phloem-feeding soft scale pests cause direct (e. g., injuries to plant tissues and removal of nutrients) and indirect damage (e. g., reduction in photosynthesis and aesthetic value by honeydew and sooty mold). Variations in life cycle, reproduction, fecundity, and behavior exist among congenerics due to host, environmental, climatic, and geographical variations. Sampling of soft scale pests involves sighting the insects or their damage, and assessing their abundance. Crawlers of most univoltine species emerge {{in the spring and}} the summer. Degree-day models and plant phenological indicators help determine the initiation of sampling and treatment against crawlers (the life stage most vulnerable to <b>contact</b> <b>insecticides).</b> The efficacy of cultural management tactics, such as fertilization, pruning, and irrigation, in reducing soft scale abundance is poorly documented. A large number of parasitoids and predators attack soft scale populations in the field; therefore, natural enemy conservation by using selective insecticides is important. Systemic insecticides provide greater flexi-bility in application method and timing, and have longer residual longevity than <b>contact</b> <b>insecticides.</b> Application timing of contact in-secticides that coincides with crawler emergence is most effective in reducing soft scale abundance...|$|R

The study addressed the major question of what is {{the response of the}} ant assemblage to the reduction of RIFA following insecticide applications (bait and <b>contact</b> <b>insecticide)</b> and the impact of these on individual species. To address this question three treatments were established in a 16 hectare area in the orchard. The treatments were randomly assigned in 1. 33 hectare blocks with four replications and periodically monitored. Treatments were: 1) insect growth regulator (IGR) bait treatment (ExtinguishTM, active compound is 0. 5 % s-methoprene) applied twice in 2000 and once in 2001; 2) the <b>contact</b> <b>insecticide</b> chlorpyrifos (LorsbanTM) applied on tree trunks four times in 2000 and once in 2001; and 3) untreated Control. Blocks were sampled using pitfall traps, baited vials, direct sampling, and colony counts. Data were analyzed by using ANOVA-GLM with the LSD multiple comparison test to compare the effect of treatment on the ant assemblage (using the Shannon index) and the effect on individual species. Additionally, data obtained from Control plots were used to compare sampling techniques and to determine what method is most efficient for collecting ants in this agroecosystem. Shannon indices were estimated for each method and compared. The ant assemblage consisted of 16 ant species. S. invicta was the most abundant followed by Paratrechina sp. and Monomorium minimum. The IGR treatment consistently reduced RIFA (77 %). Native ants were found to coexist with RIFA in the Control and chlorpyrifos plots at lower densities and maintained higher densities in IGR plots. Chlorpyrifos trunk treatment did not {{have a significant impact on}} RIFA or native ant densities. The native ant, Dorymyrmex flavus, was greater in IGR plots following RIFA reduction and higher densities were found to persist for more than two years after the last IGR treatment. During this period, D. flavus was observed carrying large numbers of dead RIFA, some taken inside the nest, and some disarticulated RIFA taken out of the nest.

Thus, a manage-ment program of these insects is a priority for grape growers. A summer pesticide trial was conducted in a vineyard, located in the Cap-Bon Region of Tunisia. The trial was carried out to assess the use of imidacloprid, a systemic insecticide, against mealybugs on vine. Imidacloprid was applied through the drip irrigation system for each vine and was then compared to methidathion, a <b>contact</b> <b>insecticide.</b> Imidacloprid {{was found to be}} more effective than methidathion on all mealybug developmental stages. In addition to its outstanding, up to 100 % efficiency, imidacloprid provided an interesting long-term control of mealybugs. No significant difference was found between the two imidacloprid rates (1 and 2 ml/vine). Methidathion generated an overall low to intermediate efficacy on mealybugs and was more effective on both first instar nymphs and adult females than on the other mealybug developmental stages. Thus, imidacloprid applied through a drip irrigation system is a new promising option to control mealybugs in vineyards. For this reason it can be employed in an integrated management program against these pests in the Tunisian grape-growing area...|$|E
