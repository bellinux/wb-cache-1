40|$|Organizational social {{practices}} (e. g., {{corporate social responsibility}} and corporate citizenship practices), {{as well as their}} costs and the benefits companies accrue from undertaking them, have been widely described and analyzed in the business and society literature. However, the debate over the mechanisms that motivate such practices has yet to evolve. This study aims at contributing to the explanation of these mechanisms. Using the institutional framework and Scott's (2001) concept of institutional pillars, I present a theoretical framework that reconciles strategic, principled, institutional, and emotional mechanisms that motivate organizational social action. I propose that <b>commitment,</b> <b>calculation,</b> conformance, and caring mechanisms motivate organizations to adopt {{social practices}}. Analyzing social practices used by companies in their interaction with the stakeholder "local community," this study examines the effects of environmental conditions and decision-maker orientation on the four motivation mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} several tenure trends, their relat. pn to other current issues in higher education, the prpblem of supporting tenure {{trends in the}} future, and several solutions to resolve the current tenure crisis including another viable basis for analyzing tenure dato [...] Some_of the more reliable position indicators of tenure trends are faculty-by-rank distribution, potential faculty eligible for tenure and actual tenured faculty rates [...] These trends indicate {{that the number of}} tenured faculty is increasing at a rate of. 5 to. 7 percent per year [...] In reviewing tenure policies, institutions must {{be able to deal with}} future program shifts, demands of collective bargaining, federal and state financial cutbacks, and normal higher. costs to retain tenured faculty [...] Several solutions applied to problems stemming from too many tenured faculty include quotas, equalized rank distribution, early retirement benefits, term contracts, more temporary appointments, appointment of new faculty only to lower racks, and general slowdown of rate of promotion. Another alternative for resolving the tenure problem involves the concept of flexible dollars [...] These are dollars not committed because of tenure, job security, or other relatively fixed forms of financial obligations [...] In analyzing institutional situations, tenure <b>commitment</b> <b>calculations</b> are based on dollars rather than on positions [...] Normally 10 to 15 percent must be added to an institution's tenured personnel percentage figure to obtain actual dollar commitment [...] (Author) A 15. :TRAC...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Atomistic {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of the TZ 1 beta-hairpin peptide {{have been carried}} out using an implicit model for the solvent. The trajectories have been analyzed using a Markov state model defined on the projections along two significant observables and a kinetic network approach. The Markov state model allowed for an unbiased identification of the metastable states of the system, and provided the basis for <b>commitment</b> probability <b>calculations</b> performed on the kinetic network. The kinetic network analysis served to extract the main transition state for folding of the peptide and to validate the results from the Markov state analysis. The combination of the two techniques allowed for a consistent and concise characterization of the dynamics of the peptide. The slowest relaxation process identified is the exchange between variably folded and denatured species, and the second slowest process is the exchange between two different subsets of the denatured state which could not be otherwise identified by simple inspection of the projected trajectory. The third slowest process is the exchange between a fully native and a partially folded intermediate state characterized by a native turn with a proximal backbon...|$|R
40|$|The study {{reviews and}} {{analyzes}} some major issues {{that must be}} considered when defining principles for distributing commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The study {{is divided into three}} main parts, where the first discusses the concept and measurement of costs, the second analyzes the negotiations and burden sharing rules, and the third analyzes the handling of a mix of greenhouse gases. The study shows that removal of subsidies on fossil fuels or minimum fossil-fuel taxes have advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness and fairness compared to quantified national reduction <b>commitments.</b> The <b>calculations</b> suggest that a moderate climate policy is optimal, but a more ambitious climate policy is favorable if emissions abatement is relatively inexpensive or climate-change effects are uncertain. The burden sharing rules examined have quite different consequences for the OECD countries depending on the choice of rule and weights of the criteria included. Due to the lack of reliable methodologies and uncertainties in the understanding of the mechanisms of some gases, not all climate gases {{should be included in the}} negotiations...|$|R
30|$|The {{in-depth}} thermo-fluid dynamics study {{required a}} reinterpretation {{of the results}} for a comprehensive comparison. The different geometric morphologies of the heat exchanger under consideration are venues of discrepant flows between them and they deserve a thorough investigation for the validation of the results. The large vortices observed in the velocity module trend, provide guidance on the turbulent and chaotic motion that is generated inside the heat exchanger. Turbulence is a dissipative phenomenon, so complicated to study that the analyses of fluid flow by computer are carried out through approximate models. Although this method of turbulent CFD analysis {{is one of the}} most used, owing to its particular flexibility and “lightness” in terms of the <b>calculation</b> <b>commitment,</b> it introduces numerical errors.|$|R
40|$|We report high {{temperature}} molecular dynamics simulations of {{the unfolding of}} the TRPZ 1 peptide using an explicit model for the solvent. The system has been simulated {{for a total of}} 6 μs with 100 -ns minimal continuous stretches of trajectory. The populated states along the simulations are identified by monitoring multiple observables, probing both the structure and the flexibility of the conformations. Several unfolding and refolding transition pathways are sampled and analyzed. The unfolding process of the peptide occurs in two steps because of the accumulation of a metastable on-pathway intermediate state stabilized by two native backbone hydrogen bonds assisted by nonnative hydrophobic interactions between the tryptophan side chains. Analysis of the un/folding kinetics and classical <b>commitment</b> probability <b>calculations</b> on the conformations extracted from the transition pathways show that the rate-limiting step for unfolding is the disruption of the ordered native hydrophobic packing (Trp-zip motif) leading from the native to the intermediate state. But, the speed of the folding process is mainly determined by the transition from the completely unfolded state to the intermediate and specifically by the closure of the hairpin loop driven by formation of two native backbone hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between tryptophan residues. The temperature dependence of the unfolding time provides an estimate of the unfolding activation enthalpy that is in agreement with experiments. The unfolding time extrapolated to room temperature is in agreement with the experimental data as well, thus providing a further validation to the analysis reported here...|$|R
40|$|The meat sub-sector {{is among}} the most {{important}} agricultural sub-sectors in Morocco. Since the middle of the 1980 s, red meat and poultry underwent deep reforms, all related to trade and price liberalization. Nowadays, with the prospects of growing market liberalization in the context of multilateral (WTO) and bilateral (FTA with the US, the Association Agreement with the EU) agreements, the question of the domestic meat competitiveness is being raised more than before. The objective {{of this paper is to}} contribute to answering that question using appropriate quantitative tools. The methodology is based on the value-chain concept and uses nominal and effective coefficients along with the domestic resource coefficient (DRC) to assess domestic comparative advantage. Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) allows us to implement alternative policy experiments related to bilateral and multilateral <b>commitments.</b> The <b>calculation</b> of the cost-competitiveness index shows that Moroccan beef (Standard bone-in meat) and poultry could not compete with French and American products. However, Moroccan beef remains relatively more competitive than poultry. Besides, the DRC is 1 for beef and 1. 34 for poultry meaning that Morocco seems to have no comparative advantage in producing poultry while neutrality is registered for beef. Lastly, among interesting policy experiments, the combined scenario of an import tariff reduction, currency devaluation and a technical progress shows the best impact on the domestic meat competitiveness. In fact, with this scenario which aims at larger Moroccan market openness, the DRC improves by 21 % for beef and 31 % for poultry. This is also the only experiment that allows probable comparative advantage for poultry in Morocco...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilisation}} {{of demand}} side resources {{is set to}} increase over the coming years {{with the advent of}} advanced metering infrastructure, home area networks and the promotion of increased energy efficiency. Demand side resources are proposed as an energy resource that, through aggregation, can form part of the power system plant mix and contribute to the flexible operation of a power system. A model for demand side resources is proposed here that captures its key characteristics for <b>commitment</b> and dispatch <b>calculations.</b> The model is tested on the all island Irish power system, and the operation of the model is simulated over one year in both a stochastic and deterministic mode, to illustrate the impact of wind and load uncertainty. The results illustrate that demand side resources can contribute to the efficient, flexible operation of systems with high penetrations of wind by replacing some of the functions of conventional peaking plant. Demand side resources are also shown to be capable of improving the reliability of the system, with reserve capability identified as a key requirement in this respect.
