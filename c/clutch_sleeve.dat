60|$|It was a {{night of}} shocks for him. Again his eyes were dilated. He shrank {{back in his chair}} and <b>clutched</b> at Hurd's <b>sleeve.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Cluyme, {{at the top}} of his speed, was come {{opposite}} to the carriage when the lady occupant got out of it. <b>Clutching</b> at his <b>sleeve,</b> she demanded where he was going. The bronze clock had a narrow escape.|$|R
60|$|The mate {{rose and}} {{mingled with the}} crowd, {{conscious}} of a little occasional <b>clutch</b> at his <b>sleeve</b> whenever other people threatened to come between them. Outside the crowd dispersed slowly, and it was some minutes before they discovered a small but compact knot of two waiting for them.|$|R

"I crave your pardon, dame," [...] {{said the}} Duke, shaking aside, fastidiously, the grasp which, in the earnestness of her exculpation, Madam Dowlas had <b>clutched</b> upon his <b>sleeve.</b> [...] "I crave your pardon. Your nearer {{approach}} has convinced {{me of my}} erroneous imputation--I should have said nantz--not canary." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rotherby {{took a step}} forward, {{his face}} purple, his hands clenched. Her ladyship thrust out a bony claw, <b>clutched</b> at his <b>sleeve,</b> and drew him back and into the chair beside her. [...] "Pho! Charles," [...] she said; [...] "give the fool rope, and he'll hang himself, never doubt it--the poor, witless creature." ...|$|R
40|$|Sometimes a {{woman would}} <b>clutch</b> his <b>sleeve,</b> crying shrilly: “Doctor, you’ll save him, won’t you? ” But he wasn’t there for saving life; {{he was there to}} order a sick man’s evacuation. How futile was the hatred he saw on faces then! “You haven’t a heart! ” a woman told him on one occasion. She was wrong; he had one. It saw him through his twenty-hour day, when he hourly watched men dying who were meant to live. —Albert Camus, The Plague Ebola virus disease is a {{zoonosis}} caused by a virus of thefamily Filoviridae, whose members comprise 2 genera of enveloped, negative, single-stranded RNA viruses: Mar-burgvirus and Ebolavirus. The latter includes 5 viruses: Ebola (EBOV) (formerly known as Zaire), Sudan (SUDV), Tai Forest (TAFV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), and Reston (RESTV), all of which are pathogenic to humans excep...|$|R

He'll go to Egypt if he'll go anywheres, because his mind keeps runnin' on Bible questions, and it 'll {{interest}} him to go out there; and we can make him believe it's just to bang around for the winter. He's terrible hopeful." [...] Now that she began to speak, all her long-repressed anxiety poured itself out, and she hitched her chair nearer to Westover and wistfully <b>clutched</b> his <b>sleeve.</b> [...] "That's the worst of Jackson. You can't make him believe anything's the matter. Sometimes I can't bear to hear him go on about himself as if he was a well young man. He expects that medium's stuff is goin' to cure him!" ...|$|R

Based on a new drive train system of pure electric vehicle, an AMESim model of vehicle drive-train system is set up. Through the precise control of sliding <b>sleeve,</b> <b>clutch</b> engagement and separating time, gear shifting process is realized without driving torque interruption. The results show that, during up and down shift process, the driving torque keeps more than 50 %, obviously improve the pure electric vehicle accelerating performance {{and the ability to}} climb. 1...|$|R
60|$|New York {{became a}} changed city to Philip. Its roar and its turmoil, its babel of tongues {{speaking}} to him always in some alien language, were suddenly hushed! He was no longer conscious of the hard unconcern of a million faces, of the crude buildings in the streets, the cutting winds, the curious, depressing sense of being on a desert island, the hermit <b>clutching</b> at the <b>sleeves</b> of imaginary multitudes. A few minutes' journey in a cable car which seemed to crawl, a few minutes' swift walking along the broad thoroughfare of Fifth Avenue, where his feet seemed to fall upon {{the air and the}} passersby seemed to smile upon him like real human beings, and he was in her room. It was only an hotel sitting room, after all, but eloquent of her, a sitting room filled with great bowls of roses, with comfortable easy-chairs, furniture of rose-coloured satin, white walls, and an English fire upon the grate. Elizabeth was in New York, and the world moved differently.|$|R
