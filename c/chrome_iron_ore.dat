40|$|AbstractWhen encountering high {{import prices}} and price volatility, China {{does not have}} the power to affect prices, {{although}} China has ranked first in <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> imports since 2003. The existing literature usually investigates the impact factors of <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> prices using the averaging method. It is difficult to depict the detailed impact of various factors on prices accurately. To provide sounder basis for the Chinese government to enact policy, this paper develops a quantile regression model with the lagged variables to measure factors that affect the import prices of <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> in China under high, medium and low price levels. The analysis uses monthly data through January 2003 to March 2015. The results indicate that the effect intensity of the factors on the prices are various under different quantiles. As prices rise, the degree of positive influence of previous period of crude steel production on <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> prices is gradually decreasing; conversely, the strength of previous period of import volume’s negative effect on prices is falling. Furthermore, it verifies that China has no voice in the international <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> market. In low quantile, the strength of effect of prior period <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> volume on prices is higher than that of China’s production of <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> on import prices because the grade of China's <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> resources is low. Therefore, when the <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> prices are at a low quantile, China should expand the import of <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> appropriately and reduce the exploitation of low-grade <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> resources. Additionally, China should optimize crude steel output and actively invest in overseas <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> exploration and mining to reduce the effect of prices fluctuations by reducing the dependence on imported <b>iron</b> <b>ore.</b> China may also promote the development of an international <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> futures market and innovate <b>iron</b> <b>ore</b> business models to hedge foreign exchange risks because of the US dollar index has greatest negative effect on the prices...|$|R
