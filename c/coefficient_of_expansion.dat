5|$|Ceramic {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low <b>coefﬁcient</b> <b>of</b> <b>expansion</b> are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The bonding glue is well used in {{packaging}} of the opto-electronic elements. The {{light paths}} {{of the elements}} are aligned accurately before bonding, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> bonding glue is much more large than the one of silicon based optoelectronic elements, the light paths of the elements are thus misalignment after the bonding. The silica filler is usually mixed into the bonding glue for lowering the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion.</b> In this paper, the ceramic powder of the ZrW 2 O 8 with negative <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> is thus mixed the commercial bonding glue for deriving of the extra low dilation adhesion. The thermal <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> the composite bonding glue with negative <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> fillers is measured accurately to compare with the filler of silica powder.

40|$|Leucite {{is a major}} {{crystalline}} {{component of}} dental porcelains. The presence of tetragonal leucite in dental porcelains increases their <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> due to its high <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> (20 – 25 × 10 − 6 /°C). This is particularly useful for those porcelains designed for bonding to precious metals and nickel alloys. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the leucite content of selected commercial dental porcelains in relation to their <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> values. The weight fraction of leucite was determined with quantitative x-ray diffraction using copper as an internal standard. <b>Coefficient</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> values were determined using a thermal dilatometric analyzer. Five commercial body porcelains were studied. Leucite was not detected in samples of Vitadur N and Duceram LFC. An ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference in the weight fraction of leucite for Silhouette, Ceramco II, and Optec HSP porcelains. Linear regression revealed a correlation (R = 0. 91) between weight fraction of leucite and the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> for those samples containing leucite. Ducram LFC, which is recommended by the manufacturer for use with metals and leucite-containing porcelains, had no detectable leucite although the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>expansion</b> was found to be 13. 2 ± 0. 4 × 10 − 6 /°C at 25 – 472 °C.
