He hit his first home run with the Rangers since 2002 on August 29, a solo shot against Minnesota Twins reliever José Mijares.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{has been}} using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without fibulae and with malformed feet, and his legs were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he <b>could</b> <b>wear</b> {{prosthetic}} legs.

5|$|St George's can admit up to 380 pupils annually. Upon admission, pupils are {{allocated}} a mixed ability form, {{where they}} are registered, taught Life Skills and have access to pastoral support from their tutors. For all the other lessons, the pupils are set by ability. Each year group has a progress manager with responsibility for the students in that year. Since the Education Act 2002, years 7, 8 and 9 have been grouped into Key Stage 3 and years 10 and 11 into Key Stage 4, which co-ordinates how the National Curriculum is taught. At St George's, a manager is assigned to each Key Stage for pastoral support. Before the conversion to Academy status, the school uniform consisted of a navy-blue blazer with the school emblem sewn on, a white shirt, navy-blue tie and dark-grey trousers (girls <b>could</b> <b>wear</b> plain-blue skirts) for all pupils in years 7–10; year 11 pupils <b>could</b> <b>wear</b> a dark-blue jumper, shirt and grey trousers. Since 2010, girls no longer wear ties, and must wear a revere collar blouse. Dark-grey trousers or a pleated dark-grey skirt are available for girls to wear; boys have dark-grey trousers. All pupils wear a blue blazer, but those in Key Stage 3 have bright blue piping on their lapels; shirts are white until Year 11, when thin blue stripes are worn.|$|E
5|$|Cinema audiences <b>could</b> <b>wear</b> {{disposable}} polarized {{glasses to}} view the film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E
5|$|For the poor, hemp was {{the common}} item {{used to make}} clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of more modest means <b>could</b> <b>wear</b> wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|E

5|$|Only Roman {{citizens}} (both plebeians and patricians) had {{the right}} to confer magisterial powers (potestas) on any individual magistrate. The most important power was imperium, which was held by consuls (the chief magistrates) and by praetors (the second highest-ranking ordinary magistrate). Defined narrowly, imperium simply gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force. Defined more broadly, however, imperium gave a magistrate the constitutional authority to issue commands (military, diplomatic, civil, or otherwise). A magistrate's imperium was at its apex while the magistrate was abroad. While the magistrate was in the city of Rome itself, however, he had to completely surrender his imperium, so that liberty (libertas) was maximized. Magistrates with imperium sat in a curule chair, and were attended by lictors (bodyguards) who carried axes called fasces which symbolized {{the power of the state}} to punish and to execute. Only a magistrate with imperium <b>could</b> <b>wear</b> a bordered toga, or be awarded a triumph.|$|E

25|$|Jewellery {{has been}} used to denote status. In ancient Rome, only certain ranks <b>could</b> <b>wear</b> rings; later, sumptuary laws {{dictated}} who <b>could</b> <b>wear</b> what type of jewellery. This was also based on rank of the citizens of that time. Cultural dictates have also played a significant role. For example, the wearing of earrings by Western men was considered effeminate in the 19th century and early 20th century. More recently, the display of body jewellery, such as piercings, has become a mark of acceptance or seen as a badge of courage within some groups but is completely rejected in others. Likewise, hip hop culture has popularised the slang term bling-bling, which refers to ostentatious display of jewellery by men or women.|$|E
25|$|Things {{started to}} change when during the European renaissance, the high heel became a status symbol worn by both male and females from the higher social statuses. Catherine de' Medici, a Franco/Italian noblewoman, pioneered the use of heels as a fashion statement. Catherine de Medici is {{believed}} to have worn them to impress the French court when she wed the Duke of Orleans, the future king. It {{is believed to be the}} first instance when heels were worn however, this reference may be apocryphal, as the development of heels did not begin to come about until the late 1580s, based on iconographic evidence and extant pieces. Two hundred years later King Louis XIV of France decreed that only nobility <b>could</b> <b>wear</b> heels, and that only members of his specific court <b>could</b> <b>wear</b> red ones. Seventeenth-century portraits of King Louis XIV depict the various intricate heels worn by the king and they were often decorated with miniature battle scenes.|$|E
25|$|Whilst commoners {{could not}} wear finer clothes than nobles did, the nobility {{had to make}} sure they were not better dressed than the King and his family. In 1528 a royal decree decided that no noble could own more than three clothes of silk. No ladies or maids <b>could</b> <b>wear</b> broad bonnets. Pearls in {{textiles}} as well as textiles containing gold were reserved for royal persons.|$|E

Cowens' uniform number (#18) had previously been worn by Jim Loscutoff, who asked that the number not be retired so future Celtics <b>could</b> <b>wear</b> it.|$|E

The Pistol Saints consists of twelve golden brooches with imprints of a gun. On the brooches the gun markings can be clearly distinguished.|$|E
