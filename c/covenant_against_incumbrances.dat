Yet covenants have persisted as a device for private planning, {{despite the lack of}} a coherent doctrinal justification or express provision for them in the original Torrens statutes. They provide a source of private legislative power for developers which is beyond effective control by public or private law. Several Australian jurisdictions allow developers to create, by registration of plans, statutory “restrictions” which are deemed to operate as restrictive covenants. At the same time, many statutes provide for public authorities to regulate through “covenants in gross” which are not recognised by equity. The overextension of the private law restrictive covenant into the realm of public regulation leaves powers inadequately regulated and creates gaps and anomalies in the application of rules...|$|R

Although socially segregated, many African-American servants for the mansions of wealthy Bolton Hill residents lived in the alley houses of Bolton Hill. At the end of the 19th century, Baltimore's German Jewish community moved to Bolton Hill. Jews had moved to the western edge of Bolton Hill, and many synagogues, such as Baltimore Hebrew, Chizuk Amuno, and Shearith Israel, moved to McCullough Street and Madison Avenue just west of Bolton Hill. Furthermore, two large temples were built within Bolton hill.

As these bodies take aim at the private transfer fee, they literally must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. A private transfer fee that benefits conservation and environmental stewardship is consistent with the traditional use of a servitude and can provide a valuable benefit to property owners and the public. This article argues that private transfer fees, when used to fund conservation and environmental stewardship, meet the historical and modern requirements for a valid servitude, that courts should hold them enforceable, and that policymakers should exempt them from general private transfer fee restrictions...|$|R

5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are {{described in terms of}} two covenants: the covenant of works and covenant of grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works (sometimes called the covenant of life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace. This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two <b>covenants</b> <b>against</b> each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|R

He was put in ward; Elizabeth threatened war; the preachers stormed against Lennox; a plot to murder him (a Douglas plot) and to seize James was discovered; Randolph, who now represented Elizabeth, was fired at, and fled to Berwick; James Stewart was created Earl of Arran. In March 1581 the king and Lennox tried to propitiate the preachers by signing a negative <b>Covenant</b> <b>against</b> Rome, later made into a precedent for the famous Covenant of 1638. On June 1 Morton was tried for guilty foreknowledge of Darnley's death. He was executed deservedly, and his head was stuck on a spike of the Tolbooth. The death of this avaricious, licentious, and resolute though unamiable Protestant was a heavy blow to the preachers and their party, and a crook in the lot of Elizabeth.|$|R
40|$|Illinois {{courts have}} long dealt with whether {{restrictive}} covenants, specifically non-compete clauses, {{can and should}} be enforced when they involve employees of businesses. Many aspects of restrictive covenants have been litigated, but a recent Illinois Appellate Court case analyzed the issue of what is adequate consideration in order to enforce a restrictive <b>covenant</b> <b>against</b> a former employee. The First District in Fifield v. Premier Dealer Services, Inc., affirmed a bright-line, two-year rule for deciding how long an employee must work for an employer before a re-strictive covenant can be enforced. The two-year rule protects employees because an employer cannot require them to sign a non-compete and then terminate their employment the next day. However, the two-year rule does not adequately take into account the employer’s standpoint because an employee could voluntarily resign one day short of two years of employment and the restrictive covenant would be void. This note analyzes the bright-line, two-year rule in Illinois for adequate consideration and shows its development over time; it looks to how other states have tried to solve this very problem; and it discusses how the problem in Illinois could be fixed either through legislative or judicial change...|$|R

Edward Carson and James Craig, leaders of the unionists, were instrumental in organising the Ulster <b>Covenant</b> <b>against</b> the [...] "coercion of Ulster", at which time Carson reviewed Orange and Unionist volunteers in various parts of Ulster. These were united into a single body known as the Ulster Volunteers at the start of 1912. This was followed in the south by the formation of the Irish Volunteers to restrain Ulster. Both Nationalists and Republicans, except for the All-for-Ireland Party, brushed unionist concerns aside with [...] "no concessions for Ulster", treating their threat as a bluff. The Act received Royal Assent and was placed on the statute books on 18 September 1914, but under the Suspensory Act was deferred for no longer than the duration of World War I which had broken out in August.
