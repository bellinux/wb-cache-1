25|$|Recent {{research}} {{using data from}} the social bookmarking website Delicious, has shown that <b>collaborative</b> <b>tagging</b> systems exhibit a form of complex systems (or self-organizing) dynamics. Although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable power law distributions. Once such stable distributions form, examining the correlations between different tags can be used to construct simple folksonomy graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtained a form of community or shared vocabularies. Such vocabularies {{can be seen as a}} form of collective intelligence, emerging from the decentralised actions of a community of users. The Wall-it Project is also an example of social bookmarking.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{example of}} emergence in web-based systems is social bookmarking (also called <b>collaborative</b> <b>tagging).</b> In social bookmarking systems, users assign tags to resources shared with other users, which {{gives rise to}} a type of information organisation that emerges from this crowdsourcing process. Recent research which analyzes empirically the complex dynamics of such systems has shown that consensus on stable distributions and a simple form of shared vocabularies does indeed emerge, {{even in the absence of}} a central controlled vocabulary. Some believe that this could be because users who contribute tags all use the same language, and they share similar semantic structures underlying the choice of words. The convergence in social tags may therefore be interpreted as the emergence of structures as people who have similar semantic interpretation collaboratively index online information, a process called semantic imitation.|$|E

TagClouds is {{a popular}} {{visualization}} for the <b>collaborative</b> <b>tags.</b> However it has some instinct problems such as linguistic issues, high semantic density and poor understanding of hierarchical structure and semantic relation between tags. In this paper we investigate the ways to support semantic understanding of <b>collaborative</b> <b>tags</b> and propose an improved visualization named TagClusters. Based on the semantic analysis of the <b>collaborative</b> <b>tags</b> in Last. fm, the semantic similar tags are clustered into different groups and the visual distance represents the semantic similarity between tags, and thus the visualization offers a better semantic understanding of <b>collaborative</b> <b>tags.</b> A comparative evaluation is conducted with TagClouds and TagClusters {{based on the same}} tags collection.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{research}} in learning technologies has demonstrated many promising {{contributions from the}} use of ontologies and Semantic Web technologies for the development of advanced learning environments. In spite of those benefits, ontology development and maintenance remain the key research challenges to be solved before ontology-enhanced learning environments are widely used. In this paper we present an approach to ontology maintenance based on the use of <b>collaborative</b> <b>tags</b> contributed by learners while using learning environments. Our contribution is twofold: i) a visualization and user interaction interface supporting the tasks of enriching ontologies with selected collaborative tags; and ii) ontology-enhanced metrics that are used for measuring semantic relatedness between <b>collaborative</b> <b>tags</b> and ontology concepts and for recommending tags which are relevant to a given ontological concept. We developed a software architecture as a proof of concept and a tool for the evaluation of our proposal.

Beginning in 2004 and quickly becoming a standard on websites, <b>collaborative</b> <b>tagging</b> allows users to upload or select materials (e.g. pictures, music files, texts, websites) and associate tags with these materials. Tags can be chosen freely, and are similar to keywords. Other users can then browse through tags; a click on a tag connects a user to similarly tagged materials. Tags furthermore enable tag clouds, which graphically represent the popularity of tags, demonstrating co-occurrence relations between tags and thus jump from one tag to another.|$|E

5000|$|A {{folksonomy}} is {{a system}} in which users apply public tags to online items, typically to aid them in re-finding those items. This can give rise to a classification system based on those tags and their frequencies, in contrast to a taxonomic classification specified by the owners of the content when it is published. This practice is also known as <b>collaborative</b> <b>tagging,</b> social classification, social indexing, and social tagging. However, these terms have slightly different meanings than folksonomy. Folksonomy was originally [...] "the result of personal free tagging of information ... for one's own retrieval". Social tagging is the application of tags in an open online environment where the tags of other users are available to others. <b>Collaborative</b> <b>tagging</b> (also known as group tagging) is tagging performed by a group of users. This type of folksonomy is commonly used in cooperative and collaborative projects such as research, content repositories, and social bookmarking.|$|E

50|$|Vander Wal is {{credited}} with coining the term “folksonomy’ in 2004. Folksonomy is sometimes called <b>collaborative</b> <b>tagging,</b> social classification, social indexing, or social tagging. It refers to taxonomies created by users applying their own tags to pieces of information (including articles, pictures, and websites). The tags aid users in categorizing information for both personal management and sharing with others. These user generated taxonomies stand in contrast to professionally created ontologies and taxonomies used for resource discovery and retrieval in more traditional knowledge organization systems.|$|E

40|$|As {{the amount}} of user {{generated}} content grows, personal information management has become a challenging problem.

P 2 P-DocTagger minimizes the efforts of individual peers and reduces computation and communication cost while providing high tagging accuracy, and eases of document organization/retrieval.

50|$|Folksonomies {{consist of}} three basic entities: users, tags, and {{resources}}. Users create tags to mark resources such as: web pages, photos, videos, and podcasts. These tags {{are used to}} manage, categorize and summarize online content. This <b>collaborative</b> <b>tagging</b> system also uses these tags {{as a way to}} index information, facilitate searches and navigate resources. Folksonomy also includes a set of URLs that are used to identify resources that have been referred to by users of different websites. These systems also include category schemes that have the ability to organize tags at different levels of granularity.|$|E
50|$|An {{empirical}} {{analysis of}} the complex dynamics of tagging systems, published in 2007, has shown that consensus around stable distributions and shared vocabularies does emerge, {{even in the absence}} of a central controlled vocabulary. For content to be searchable, it should be categorized and grouped. While this was believed to require commonly agreed on sets of content describing tags (much like keywords of a journal article), some research has found that in large folksonomies common structures also emerge on the level of categorizations.Accordingly, it is possible to devise mathematical models of <b>collaborative</b> <b>tagging</b> that allow for translating from personal tag vocabularies (personomies) to the vocabulary shared by most users.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{apparent}} lack of control, {{research has shown that}} a simple form of shared vocabulary emerges in social bookmarking systems. <b>Collaborative</b> <b>tagging</b> exhibits a form of complex systems dynamics (or self-organizing dynamics). Thus, even if no central controlled vocabulary constrains the actions of individual users, the distribution of tags converges over time to stable power law distributions. Once such stable distributions form, simple folksonomic vocabularies can be extracted by examining the correlations that form between different tags. In addition, research has suggested that it is easier for machine learning algorithms to learn tag semantics when users tag [...] "verbosely"—when they annotate resources with a wealth of freely associated, descriptive keywords.|$|E

40|$|The {{past few}} years have {{witnessed}} the great success of a new family of paradigms, so-called folksonomy, which allows users to freely associate tags to resources and efficiently manage them.

The present model introduces a novel mechanism {{that one can not}} only assign tags to resources, but also retrieve resources via <b>collaborative</b> <b>tags.</b> We then compare the model with a real-world dataset: Del. icio. us. Indeed, the present model shows considerable agreement with the empirical data in following aspects: power-law hyperdegree distributions, negtive correlation between clustering coefficients and hyperdegrees, and small average distances. Furthermore, the model indicates that most tagging behaviors are motivated by labeling tags to resources, and tags {{play a significant role in}} effectively retrieving interesting resources and making acquaintance with congenial friends. The proposed model may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of the structure and function of folksonomy. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figures, 32 reference...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work proposes an {{approach}} to <b>collaborative</b> <b>tag</b> recommendation based on a machine learning system for probabilistic regression. The goal of the method is to support users of current social network systems by providing a rank of new meaningful tags for a resource. This system provides a ranked tag set and it feeds on different posts depending on the resource for which the recommendation is requested and on the user who requests the recommendation. Different kinds of collaboration among users and resources are introduced. That collaboration adds to the training set additional posts carefully selected according to the interaction among users and/or resources. Furthermore, a selection of post using scoring measures is also proposed including a penalization of oldest post. The performance of these approaches is tested according to F 1 but just considering at most the first five tags of the ranking, which is the evaluation measure proposed in ECML PKDD Discovery Challenge 2009. The experiments were carried out over two different kind of data sets of Bibsonomy folksonomy, core and no core, reaching a performance of 26. 25 % for the former and 6. 98 % for the latter. ...|$|R

[...] Morville writes, “I’ll take the ancient tree of knowledge over the transient leaves of popularity any day”. There is undoubtedly scepticism towards the adoption of folksonomies.

40|$|Content {{organization}} {{over the}} Internet went through several interesting phases of evolution: from structured directories to unstructured Web search engines and more recently, to tagging {{as a way}} for aggregating information, a step towards the semantic web vision. Tagging allows ranking and data organization to directly utilize inputs from end users, enabling machine processing of Web content. Since tags are created by individual users in a free form, one important problem facing tagging is to identify most appropriate tags, while eliminating noise and spam. For this purpose, we define a set of general criteria for a good tagging system. These criteria include high coverage of multiple facets to ensure good recall, least effort to reduce the cost involved in browsing, and high popularity to ensure tag quality. We propose a <b>collaborative</b> <b>tag</b> suggestion algorithm using these criteria to spot high-quality tags. The proposed algorithm employs a goodness measure for tags derived from collective user authorities to combat spam.
