40|$|Methods {{for size}} {{classification}} of wood chips were analysed {{in an international}} round robin using 13 conventional wood chip samples and two specially prepared standard samples, one from wood chips and one from hog fuel. The true size distribution of these two samples (according to length, width and height) had been determined stereometrically (reference method) using a digital <b>calliper</b> <b>gauge</b> and by weighing each of the about 7000 wood particles per sample. Five different horizontal and three rotary screening devices were tested using five different screen hole diameters (3. 15, 8, 16, 45, 63 mm, round holes). These systems are compared to a commercially available continuously measuring image analysis equipment. The results show that among the devices of a measuring principle—horizontal and rotary screening—the results are quite comparable, {{while there is a}} severe incompatibility when distributions are determined by different measuring principles. Highest conformity with the reference values is given for measurements with an image analysis system, whereas for all machines with horizontal screens the median value of the size distribution only reached between one-third to half of the reference median value for the particle length distribution. These deviations can be attributed to a higher particle misplacement, which is particularly found in the larger fractions. Such differences decrease when the particle’s shape is more roundish (i. e. sphericity closer to one). The median values of length distributions from screenings with a rotary classifier are between the measurements from an image analysis and horizontal screening devices. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{focusing}} on the measurement methods of the femoral head at the hip hemiarthroplasty surgery. The measurement result of 10 femoral head specimens using four different methods of Vernier <b>calliper,</b> ring <b>gauge,</b> CT scan and X-ray were compared. It is generally believed that under sizing of the implant may cover the errors of the measurement methods, but {{the result of this}} study shows that the <b>callipers</b> and ring <b>gauge</b> measurements are more reliable than the CT and X-ray methods. Conclusively, the full-circle ring gauge or femoral head template is the recommendation for measurement of the femoral head diameter in the hip hemiarthroplasty surgery...|$|R

This study investigates the existing methods to measure the femoral head before a total or hemi- arthroplasty. In the experimental evaluation of the current study, the size of 15 femur head sample has been measured using four different methods: Vernier caliper, ring gauge, X-ray images and CT scan data. The results from various methods were compared and discussed. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyse the most effective mode of measurement for hemi-arthoplastic surgery. The accuracy and reliability of each method was analysed by taking measurements of the femoral head. Statistical analysis shows that the <b>callipers</b> and ring <b>gauge</b> are the most accurate next to CT and X-ray models. It was also observed that an under sizing by ± 1 mm of the femoral head shows no definitive harm to a patient...|$|R
