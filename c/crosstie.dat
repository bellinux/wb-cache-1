50|$|Railroad {{development}} {{kept pace}} with the expanding frontier in the United States after the American Civil War, creating a burgeoning need for new railroad ties. Every mile of track required about 2,500-3,500 crossties. Trains became heavier and faster and the railroads found it was less expensive to add more ties per mile than to buy heavier rail. During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson created the United States Railroad Administration to support the financially weak railroad industry. The USRA took control of pricing and standardization of <b>crosstie</b> sizes. Following World War I, tie demand contracted as railroads consolidated lines, used more preserved wood ties, and the Great Depression caused railroads to become bankrupt. During the Great Depression, the Federal Government of the United States again stepped in to control the price of forest products, including wood ties. During World War II, tie demand rose again as the war effort created {{a need for more}} track and thus more ties. Tie demand has seen its share of ebb and flow, but remains fairly constant as ties {{come to the end of}} their useful life in track and are retired to other uses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Crossties {{and cable}} {{networks}} are used on cable-stayed bridges to mitigate wind-induced stay vibration. A nonlinear free-vibration {{analysis of a}} cable network with random oscillation amplitudes is presented in this study. Specifically, a nonlinear restoring-force spring model is introduced at the <b>crosstie</b> to simulate in-plane network free vibration at large amplitudes. The current constitutive model of the <b>crosstie</b> is also combinedwith taut-cable theory to simulate the dynamics in the stays and is solved by the equivalent linearizationmethod. Stochastic functions are introduced in the model because {{the measure of the}} amplitudes produced by wind- and rain-wind–induced vibrations in the network can be affected by various uncertainties. The stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm is applied to find the roots of the characteristic polynomials associated with a stochastic vibration amplitude parameter. Brute force Monte Carlo methods are also used to analyze the SA convergence properties. DOI: 10. 1061 /(ASCE) EM. 1943 - 7889. 0000887. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E
40|$|With {{the current}} trend of {{increased}} traffic and axle loads, decreased maintenance budgets, and increased spending on crossties, {{it has become increasingly}} important to optimize track component maintenance. This includes longer life components, better identification of failed components, and higher production inspection and maintenance activities. This paper focuses on one aspect of this need, the inspection and maintenance planning improvements for crossties. The status quo for <b>crosstie</b> inspection is to use the calibrated eye of the tie inspector to identify those ties that need replacement. This results in a requirement that the inspectors be trained to consistently identify bad ties based on their condition and the reason for replacement. An advancement made in <b>crosstie</b> evaluation is the lateral track strength inspection vehicles, which provide a continuous measure of the tracks ability to withstand lateral forces.

40|$|The {{prestressed}} concrete railway sleepers (or railroad ties), which are installed in railway track systems as the <b>crosstie</b> beam support, {{are designed to}} carry and transfer the wheel loads from the rails to the ground. It {{is well known that}} railway tracks are subject to impact loading conditions, which are attributable to the train operations with either wheel or rail abnormalities such as flat wheels, dipped rails, etc. These loads are of very high magnitude but short duration. In many cases, it has been reported from the fields that concrete sleepers are lacking of support due to mud pumping or excessive but localised track settlement, so-called ‘voided sleepers’. This paper presents a numerical study to evaluate dynamic responses of the voided concrete sleepers to impact loading. A simplified finite element model of concrete sleepers was developed and validated against experimental data. The model has then been used to evaluate the effect of voids on the dynamic responses of concrete sleeper to a typical impact loading. The outcome of this study will help engineers to determine the life of assets and to investigate the failure mode of concrete sleepers and associated track components in actual ballasted tracks.

40|$|As the <b>crosstie</b> beam in {{railway track}} systems, the {{prestressed}} concrete sleepers (or railroad ties) are principally designed {{in order to}} carry wheel loads from the rails to the ground. Their design takes into account static and dynamic loading conditions. It is evident that prestressed concrete has {{played a significant role}} as to maintain the high endurance of the sleepers under low to moderate repeated impact loads. In spite of the most common use of the prestressed concrete sleepers in railway tracks, there have always been considerable demands from rail and track engineers to improve serviceability and functionality of concrete sleepers. For example, signalling, fibre optic, equipment cables are often damaged either by acute ballast corners or by tamping machine operation. There has been a significant need to re-design concrete sleeper to cater cables internally so that they would not experience detrimental or harsh environments. Accordingly, this study is the world first to experimentally investigate the effects of holes and web openings on structural behaviours of concrete sleepers under rail loading condition. The modified compression field theory for ultimate strength behaviours of concrete sleepers will be highlighted in this study. The outcome of this study will enable the new design and calculation methods for prestressed concrete sleepers with holes and web opening that practically benefits civil, track and structural engineers in railway industry...|$|E
40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} sleepers (or railroad ties) {{are designed}} {{in order to}} carry and transfer the wheel loads from the rails {{to the ground and}} are installed as the <b>crosstie</b> beam support in railway track systems. They are subjected to impact loading conditions that are resulted from train operations over wheel or rail abnormalities, such as flat wheels, dipped rails, crossing transfers, rail squats, corrugation, etc. The magnitude of the shock load relies on various factors such as axle load, types of wheel/rail imperfections, speeds of vehicle, track stiffness, etc. This paper demonstrates the development of finite element modelling to evaluate the dynamic responses of prestressed tendons or wires embedded in concrete sleepers, particularly under a variety of impact loads. The force prediction under high speed rail environment was conducted using D-TRACK. The 3 D finite element model of prestressed concrete sleeper has been developed using a finite element package, LS-Dyna. It has been verified by the experiments carried out using the high capacity drop-weight impact machine at the University of Wollon-gong, Australia. The experimental results provide very good correlation with numerical simulations. In this paper, the numerical studies are extended to evaluate the dynamic behaviors of high strength steel wires and their responses under different parameters in high speed rail environments. The outcome of this study can potentially lead to the dynamic design guideline for prestressed concrete sleepers under low-cycle fatigues.

40|$|As {{maintenance}} and capital budgets {{continue to be}} scrutinized, {{it has become increasingly}} important to optimize precious resources, and {{to get the most out}} of those resources. Recent work in North America and overseas has focused on getting the most out of an individual wood <b>crosstie.</b> This research has been based on the use of handheld tie inspection equipment, providing an abundance of data as to the condition of each tie, as well as the distribution of tie conditions. The premise of the activity has been to allow failing ties to remain in track, provided that they have surrounding support from good or near good ties. Traditional tie replacement methodologies ahead of a tie gang have been to remove all ties that will fail prior to the next tie gang cycle. This in effect results in removing ties with remaining life from track. The approach presented herein is to leave ties in track that may fail prior to the next cycle, as long as the distribution of tie conditions remains within a given standard. These standards are a function of track class (operating speed), proximity to bridges, crossings, turnouts, etc. and other key factors. Applying this methodology to railroads in North America and Europe has shown a possible decrease in tie requirements during a given tie gang cycle of the order of 12 %. This essentially manifests itself into an “effective ” tie life extension of the order of 14 %. The economics of “effectively ” extending the life of any given asset are considerable, especially given today’s economy...|$|E
40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} sleepers (or railroad ties) are the <b>crosstie</b> {{beam support}} in railway track systems. They are designed and constructed under flexural constraints {{in order to}} carry and transfer the dynamic wheel loads from the rails to the ground. Under perfect wheel and rail conditions, the dynamic loading on railway tracks could {{be treated as a}} quasi-static load using a dynamic impact factor. The current design method for the prestressed concrete sleepers taking into account the quasi-static effect is based on allowable stress where crack initiation is not permitted. In reality, the impact events are often detected due to the uncertainties of wheel or rail abnormalities such as flat wheels, dipped rails, etc. These loads are of very high magnitude but short duration. Over the design life span of the prestressed concrete sleepers, there exists the feasibility of extreme and repeated impact loading events. These have led to two proposed limit states for the consideration of structural engineers: ultimate limit states and fatigue limit states. Prestressing techniques have been long used to maintain the high endurance of the sleepers under repeated impact cycles. In spite of the most common use of the prestressed concrete sleepers, their impact behavior and capacity under the repetitions of severe impact loads are unclear. This paper presents the experimental investigation aimed at understanding the dynamic crack propagations in prestressed concrete sleepers in railway track structures under repeated impact loading.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The {{objective of the}} present investigation has been threefold: (1) To characterize domain wall motion in thin ferromagnetic films experimentally and to determine what film properties influence wall mobility. (2) To investigate ferromagnetic resonance relaxation in thin films {{over a wide range}} of temperature, frequency, and thickness and to determine what physical relaxation processes contribute to the resonance linewidth. (3) To correlate the losses for wall motion with relaxation processes for ferromagnetic resonance. Domain wall mobility for Ni-Fe alloy films has been measured as a function of film thickness from 300 to 1650 [angstroms]. Between 300 and 800 [angstroms] the mobility decreases with increasing film thickness, ranging from 8 x 10 [superscript 3] cm/sec- 0 e at 300 [angstroms] to 3 x 10 [superscript 3] cm/sec- 0 e at 800 [angstroms]. Between 900 and 1000 [angstroms], the mobility increases rapidly with increasing film thickness to about 7 x 10 [superscript 3] cm/sec- 0 e. Above 1000 [angstroms], the mobility increases slowly with film thickness. Predictions based on Lorentz microscopy static wall shape measurements are in good agreement with the data for a constant value of the Landau-Lifshitz damping parameter [alpha] = 0. 014. Eddy-current losses are negligible. The <b>crosstie</b> and Bloch line structures associated with domain walls in thin films do not appear to influence the mobility. The sharp increase in mobility between 900 and 1000 [angstroms] is associated with a wall structure transition in this region. Ferromagnetic resonance linewidth measurements have been made for films 150 to 3200 [angstroms] thick at frequencies from 1 to 9 Gc/sec and temperature from 2 [degrees]K to 300 [degrees]K with the static field in the film plane. Linewidths between 3 0 e (1 Gc/sec) and 50 0 e (9 Gc/sec) were observed. For fixed thickness, the 300 [degrees]K linewidth increases monotonically with anisotropy dispersion. To eliminate dispersion, samples with the smallest linewidth [ [...] . ] were selected for each thickness. For thickness less than a critical thickness [ [...] . ]. [ [...] . ] is independent of thickness, but increases with thickness for D > D[ [...] . ]. The data are in good agreement with predictions based on two-magnon scattering between the uniform mode and degenerate magnons. Eddy-current losses are not important. The phenomenological damping varies from 0. 005 (D = 400 [angstroms] to 0. 009 (D = 3200 [angstroms]) for the 300 [degrees]K data. As a function of temperature, the linewidth exhibits a maximum at about 80 [degrees]K which is generally larger in thinner films. The amplitude of the peak (as high as 15 0 e) is independent of frequency and the peak shifts to slightly higher temperatures with increasing frequency. Two annealing treatments at 150 [degrees]C, one in a vacuum and one in hydrogen or oxygen, indicate that the temperature dependence is associated with a surface oxide layer. Two mechanisms, valence exchange and exchange anisotropy, may be important. Even though phenomenological damping parameters for the two processes, wall motion and resonance, are quite different (at 300 [degrees]K), there is a definite connection between the losses. Changes in the wall mobility between 300 [degrees]K and 77 [degrees]K have been measured for films exhibiting, to varying degrees, the above linewidth effect. From these mobility and linewidth data, the losses for wall motion were found to be directly related to the losses for resonance from 300 [degrees]K to 77 [degrees]K. There is a definite connection between the relaxation processes which are important for wall motion and those involved in resonance...|$|E
