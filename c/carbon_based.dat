500|$|The growth-differentiation balance {{hypothesis}} {{states that}} plant defenses {{are a result}} of a tradeoff between [...] "growth-related processes" [...] and [...] "differentiation-related processes" [...] in different environments. Differentiation-related processes are defined as [...] "processes that enhance the structure or function of existing cells (i.e. maturation and specialization)." [...] A plant will produce chemical defenses only when energy is available from photosynthesis, and plants with the highest concentrations of secondary metabolites are the ones with an intermediate level of available resources. The GDBH also accounts for tradeoffs between growth and defense over a resource availability gradient. In situations where resources (e.g. water and nutrients) limit photosynthesis, carbon supply is predicted to limit both growth and defense. As resource availability increases, the requirements needed to support photosynthesis are met, allowing for accumulation of carbohydrate in tissues. As resources are not sufficient to meet the large demands of growth, these carbon compounds can instead be partitioned into the synthesis of <b>carbon</b> <b>based</b> secondary metabolites (phenolics, tannins, etc.). In environments where the resource demands for growth are met, carbon is allocated to rapidly dividing meristems (high sink strength) at the expense of secondary metabolism. Thus rapidly growing plants are predicted to contain lower levels of secondary metabolites and vice versa. In addition, the tradeoff predicted by the GDBH may change over time, as evidenced by a recent study on Salix spp. Much support for this hypothesis is present in the literature, and some scientists consider the GDBH the most mature of the plant defense hypotheses.|$|E

2500|$|An {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) is {{a technology that}} uses a high pressure gasifier to turn coal and other <b>carbon</b> <b>based</b> fuels into pressurized gas—synthesis gas (syngas). It can then remove impurities from the syngas prior to the power generation cycle. Some of these pollutants, such as sulfur, {{can be turned into}} re-usable byproducts through the Claus process. This results in lower emissions of sulfur dioxide, particulates, mercury, and in some cases carbon dioxide. With additional process equipment, a water-gas shift reaction can increase gasification efficiency and reduce carbon monoxide emissions by converting it to carbon dioxide. [...] The resulting carbon dioxide from the shift reaction can be separated, compressed, and stored through sequestration. Excess heat from the primary combustion and syngas fired generation is then passed to a steam cycle, similar to a combined cycle gas turbine. This process results in improved thermodynamic efficiency compared to conventional pulverized coal combustion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for <b>carbon</b> nanotube <b>based</b> gas sensing. Instead of sensing the gas directly, the gas molecules are first ionized {{and then the}} ionized molecules are sensed by the single <b>carbon</b> nanotube <b>based</b> ion sensor. The adsorption of ionized gas molecule on the carbon nanotube surface introduces electrons into the material and consequently changes the current of the sensor. Once the electron of an ionized gas molecule is desorbed and transported to the electrode, the gas molecule is released from the carbon nanotube and another ionized gas molecule is adsorbed onto the carbon nanotbue surface. In this way, {{the response of the}} sensor is much faster than the traditional <b>carbon</b> nanotube <b>based</b> gas sensors which directly sense the gas molecules. A single <b>carbon</b> nanotube <b>based</b> ion sensor is fabricated and assembled to verify this theory. The electrical behavior of a single multiwall carbon nanotube is measured and analyzed. Experimental results show the responses of the ion sensor to oxygen ions. It is shown that the sensor exhibits a reversible response with a recovery time of couple seconds, which is much less than the traditional gas sensors' recovery time of several minutes to couple hours. © 2006 IEEE.
