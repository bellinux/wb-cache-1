40|$|Subthreshold circuit design, while energy efficient, has the {{drawback}} {{of performance}} degradation. To retain the excellent energy efficiency while reducing performance loss, we propose to investigate near sub-threshold techniques on chip multiprocessors (CMP). We show that logic and memory cells have different optimal supply and threshold voltages, therefore we propose {{to allow the}} cores and memory to operate in different voltage regions. With the memory operating at a different voltage, we then explore the design space in which several slower cores clustered together share a faster L 1 cache. We show that an architecture such as this is optimal for energy efficiency. In particular, SPLASH 2 benchmarks show a 53 % energy reduction over the conventional CMP approach (70 % energy reduction over a single <b>core</b> <b>machine).</b> In addition we explore the design trade-offs that occur {{if we have a}} separate instruction and data cache.
