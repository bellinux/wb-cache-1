5|$|An f-deck is a {{data file}} that {{contains}} {{a record of the}} fixes of a storm's location and/or intensity. A location fix is any position estimate of the storm center. An intensity fix is any estimate of the storm's intensity. Both location and intensity fixes can be obtained by aircraft flying low-level penetrations through the storm center. Various methods that use satellite imagery or other remote sensing <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>provide</b> location and intensity fixes.|$|E
5|$|Ray tourism {{benefits}} {{locals and}} visitors by raising awareness of natural resource management and educating {{them about the}} animals. It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>provide</b> funds for research and conservation. Constant unregulated interactions with tourists can negatively affect the fish by disrupting ecological relationships and increasing disease transmission. At Bora Bora, an excessive number of swimmers, boaters and jet skiers caused the local manta ray population to abandon the area.|$|E
5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>provide</b> more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Exception {{mechanism}} {{is important for}} the development of robust programs to make sure that exceptions are handled appropriately at run-time. In this paper, we develop a dynamic exception monitoring system, which can trace handling and propagation of thrown exceptions in real-time. With this tool, programmers can examine exception handling process in more details and handle exceptions more effectively. Programmers <b>can</b> <b>also</b> trace only interesting exceptions by selecting options before execution. It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>provides</b> profile information after execution, which summarizes exception handling in each method during execution. To reduce performance overhead, we implement the system based on code inlining, and presents some experimental results...|$|R
