30|$|In Batatal, {{we found}} that 80 % of FS in the uplands are {{specialised}} in banana (Musa sp.) production (classified as FS 1) and 20 % had a mixed system of cassava (Manihot sp.) and banana (FS 2). In the lowlands of Batatal, two additional FS where agriculture is more intensive were classified as FS 3 and FS 4 and are equally distributed. FS 3 has a production system composed of cassava, green maize (Zea mays), yams (Colocasia sp.) and courgette (Cucurbita sp.), while FS 4 has the same mix of cassava, green maize and yams, but banana instead <b>of</b> <b>courgette</b> (Table 3).|$|R

40|$|Wet {{root rot}} caused by Rhizoctonia solani Kühn in pulse crops was favored by {{wide range of}} soil {{parameters}} like temperature, humidity, pH, electric conductivity and soil texture. The areas surveyed for {{the collection of the}} isolates showing variable atmospheric temperature and relative humidity and low to medium levels of soil organic carbon and high level of available phosphorus influenced the development of the disease incidence from 2 - 48 %. Seventy three <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> mungbean, twenty eight <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> urdbean and eight <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> cowpea were evaluated against virulent isolate of R. solani (RASC 30) to design a set <b>of</b> differential <b>cultivars</b> for virulence analysis. Two <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> urdbean, namely, NDU 3 - 4 and IPU 2 - 14, one <b>cultivar</b> <b>of</b> mungbean, namely, HUM 1 and three <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> cowpea, namely, V 240, V 585 and DCP 7 showed resistant reactions.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics, the bromatologic composition, and digestibility of silages of different types <b>of</b> sorghum and <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> maize submitted to two cutting heights of the plants (0, 1 m and 0, 5 m). Four groups <b>of</b> <b>cultivars</b> were employed. These groups were formed by two <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> grain sorghum, two <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> sorghum double intention, two <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> forage sorghum, and two <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> corn. The experiment was conducted under the randomized block design in 4 x 2 factorial scheme, i. e. four cultivars and two cutting heights, with three replicates. The following characteristics were evaluated: dry matter yield (DM), participation of culm (CMS), leaf (FMS) and panicles or spikes attributes (PEMS) in the DM, density of plants, fall ill plants and slopes, days for the harvest, height of plants, crude protein (CP), neuter detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and degradability “in situ” after 24 hours (DEG). Significant effects only were found for cutting heights for the culm participation in DM and ADF characteristic, being that {{the rise of the}} height of cut of 0, 1 m for 0, 5 m reduced the values of CMS (32, 5 % for 29, 9 %) and of ADF(25, 9 % for 23, 2 %), not influencing, however, the NDF and the degradability of DM “in situ” after 24 hours. The <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> corn had gotten lesser values <b>of</b> CMS that <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> forage sorghum and similar to the other types of sorghum, in two cutting heights. The <b>cultivars</b> <b>of</b> corn and forage sorghum stood out for presenting greater dry matter yield, respectively 14, 4 ton. ha- 1 and 13, 3 ton. ha- 1. The corn cultivars conferred greater nutritive value to silages due to the lower percentages of fiber and greater percentage of rumen-degraded dry matter...|$|R
