5|$|Spectroscopic {{observations}} of Hale–Bopp revealed {{the presence of}} many organic chemicals, several of which had never been detected in comets before. These complex molecules may exist within the <b>cometary</b> <b>nucleus,</b> or might be synthesised by reactions in the comet.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp was a record-breaking comet—the {{farthest}} comet {{from the}} Sun discovered by amateurs, {{with the largest}} well-measured <b>cometary</b> <b>nucleus</b> known after 95P/Chiron, and it was {{visible to the naked}} eye for twice as long as the previous record-holder.

5|$|As well {{as these}} molecules, {{emission}} from heavy atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances {{consistent with what}} would {{be found in a}} <b>cometary</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Although a substantial amount of water was detected spectroscopically, it was not as much as predicted beforehand, meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{model for}} the {{rotational}} motion of split <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei</b> is studied. A large-amplitude precession is easily excited due to the change of the moments of inertia even if the perturbation is small at the splitting.

50|$|<b>Cometary</b> <b>nuclei</b> vary in {{size from}} a few {{hundreds}} of metres across or less to many kilometres across. When they approach the Sun, large amounts {{of gas and dust}} are ejected by <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei,</b> due to solar heating. A crucial factor in how bright a comet becomes is how large and how active its nucleus is. After many returns to the inner Solar System, <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei</b> become depleted in volatile materials and thus are much less bright than comets which are making their first passage through the Solar System.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: We are {{continuing}} our program {{to determine the}} size distribution of <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei.</b> We have compiled a catalog of 105 measurements of 57 <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei,</b> drawn from the general literature, from our own program of CCD photometry of distant <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei</b> (Lowry and Weissman), and from unpublished observations by colleagues. We model the cumulative size distribution of the nuclei as a power law. Previous determinations of the size distribution slope do not agree. Fernandez et al. found a slope of alpha = 2. 65 +/- 0. 25 whereas Lowry et al. and Weissman and Lowry each found a slope of alpha = 1. 60 +/- 0. 10...|$|R
5|$|Just {{minutes after}} the impact, the flyby probe passed by the nucleus at a close {{distance}} of , taking pictures of the crater position, the ejecta plume, and the entire <b>cometary</b> <b>nucleus.</b> The entire event was also photographed by Earth-based telescopes and orbital observatories, including the Hubble, Chandra, Spitzer, and XMM-Newton. The impact was also observed by cameras and spectroscopes on board Europe's Rosetta spacecraft, which was about 80millionkm (50millionmiles) from the comet {{at the time of}} impact. Rosetta determined the composition of the gas and dust cloud that was kicked up by the impact.|$|E
5|$|Observers {{hoped that}} the impacts would give them a first glimpse of Jupiter beneath the cloud tops, as lower {{material}} was exposed by the comet fragments punching through the upper atmosphere. Spectroscopic studies revealed absorption lines in the Jovian spectrum due to diatomic sulfur (S2) and carbon disulfide (CS2), the first detection of either in Jupiter, and only the second detection of S2 in any astronomical object. Other molecules detected included ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The amount of sulfur implied by the quantities of these compounds was {{much greater than the}} amount that would be expected in a small <b>cometary</b> <b>nucleus,</b> showing that material from within Jupiter was being revealed. Oxygen-bearing molecules such as sulfur dioxide were not detected, to the surprise of astronomers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Deep Impact {{mission will}} provide the highest {{resolution}} images yet of a comet nucleus. Our knowledge of the makeup and structure of <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei,</b> and the processes shaping their surfaces, is extremely limited, thus use of the Deep Impact data to show the geological context of the cratering experiment is crucial.

40|$|Attempts {{to observe}} <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei</b> and to {{determine}} fundamental physical parameters relevant {{to the relationship between}} comets and asteroids are reviewed. It has been found that <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei,</b> at least of periodic comets, are bigger and blacker than generally thought as recently as five years ago. Geometric albedos may be typically three percent and typical radii are probably of order 5 km. Nuclei of periodic comets are probably highly prolate unless they are both oblate and rotating about one of the major axes. P/Halley images provide convincing evidence of the existence of mantles discussed in many models.

40|$|The paper reviews {{evidence}} for the accumulation of the terrestrial planets and comets from solid grains, with emphasis on the various proposals {{for the formation of}} <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei.</b> With three exceptions, all hypotheses conclude or imply that a single compact object forms. Several hypotheses start with Goldreich-Ward-type gravitational instabilities. The collapse for this case also occurs at low velocities in the cm/s to m/s range. Experiment and theory show that under these conditions, low-density, filamentary clusters form that are fractal aggregates with a fractal dimension approximately equal to 2. In order to form <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei,</b> the initial temperature must be about 50 K and not undergo a significant temperature rise during the accumulation process. The calculations show that accumulation will occur at low temperatures.

40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that {{the age of the}} Venusian northern hemisphere surface studied thus far could be as great as {{the average age of the}} earth's crust (450 Myr). This possibility arises because of the uncertainty of the role of active and inactive <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei</b> in the crateral history of the earth.

50|$|Observational {{evidence}} {{suggest that}} the <b>cometary</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{may not be a}} well-consolidated single body, but may instead be a loosely bound agglomeration of smaller fragments, weakly bonded and subject to occasional or even frequent disruptive events, although the larger cometary fragments are expected to be primordial condensations rather than collisionally derived debris as in the asteroid case. However, in situ observations by the Rosetta mission, indicates that it may be more complex than that.|$|E

50|$|The nucleus is the solid, {{central part}} of a comet, popularly termed a dirty snowball or an icy dirtball. A <b>cometary</b> <b>nucleus</b> is {{composed}} of rock, dust, and frozen gases. When heated by the Sun, the gases sublimate and produce an atmosphere surrounding the nucleus known as the coma. The force exerted on the coma by the Sun's radiation pressure and solar wind cause an enormous tail to form, which points away from the Sun. A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0.04. This is blacker than coal, and {{may be caused by}} a covering of dust.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{discuss the}} {{possibility}} that CI and CM carbonaceous chondrites are fragments of ex-tinct <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Theoretical and observational work suggests that comets evolve into asteroids, and several extinct <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei</b> are now suspected {{to be among the}} near Earth object population. This population is the most likely source of meteorites and consequently, we may expect that some meteorites are from extinct comets in this population. The mineralogy and chemistry of CI and CM chondrites is consistent with the view that they originate from asteroidal objects of carbonaceous spectral classes, and these objects in turn may have a cometary origin. We do not suggest that CI or CM chondrites are directly delivered by active comets during perihelion passage or that these chon-drites come from cometary debris in meteor streams. Instead, we summarize arguments suggesting that CI and CM chondrites represent fragments of <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei</b> which evolved into near Earth asteroids after losing their volatiles. 1...|$|R
50|$|The comet's orbit, later {{computed}} by John Russell Hind, {{showed a}} perihelion distance (closest {{approach to the}} Sun) of 4.05 AU which is just within the orbit of Jupiter. However, despite this it became visible, although faintly, to the naked eye, and indeed remained visible for six months in total. This suggests that its absolute magnitude or intrinsic brightness was unusually high, possibly as high as −3.0. It is therefore likely that the Comet of 1729 was an exceptionally large object, with a <b>cometary</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{of the order of}} 100 km in diameter. The JPL small-body database only uses three observations, a two-body model, and an assumed epoch to compute the orbit of this parabolic comet.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{principle}} of the experiment consists in using the electromagnetic propagation (90 MHz VHF radio) through the cometary interior. An electromagnetic wave-front propagates through the <b>cometary</b> <b>nucleus</b> at a smaller velocity than in free space and loses energy in the process. Both the change in velocity and the energy loss depend on the complex permittivity of the cometary materials. Theyalso depend on {{the ratio of the}} wavelength used to the size of any inhomogeneities present. Thus, any signal that has propagated through the medium contains information concerning this medium. The change in velocity of the electromagnetic wave induced by propagation through the cometary material is calculable from the time taken by the wave to travel between the orbiterand the lander, while the loss of energy is deducible from the change in signal amplitude.|$|E

Although <b>cometary</b> <b>nuclei</b> are not generally accessible to observation, observations of cometary comae can illuminate {{at least some of the}} mysteries of the nuclei provided one has a detailed knowledge of the excitation conditions in the coma and also has access to basic atomic and molecular data on the many species present in comets.
