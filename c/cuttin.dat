40|$|Abstract [...] - Day by day use of {{composite}} materials increases {{due to their}} superior strength to weight ratio and stiffness to weight ratio at high service temperatures. Aeronautic, aerospace, automotive and marine industry are the dominant consumers of the composites, but their properties like brittleness, anisotropy and non-homogeneity make it a difficult to machine by conventional machining methods. This leads to study the machinability characteristics of composites. Laser machining offers an attractive machinability as an alternative for machining the composites. The present investigation deals with the laser machining of the Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastic (GFRP) Composite.

40|$|Interactive surgery {{simulations}} have conflicting {{requirements of}} speed and accuracy. In this paper we show how to combine a relatively accurate deformation model [...] -the Finite Element (FE) method [...] -and interactive cutting without requiring expensive matrix updates or precomputation. Our approach uses an iterative algorithm for an interactive linear FE deformation simulation. The iterative process requires no global precomputation, so runtime changes of the mesh, i. e. cuts, can be simulated efficiently. Cuts are performed along faces of the mesh; this prevents growth of the mesh. We present a provably correct method for changing the mesh topology, and a satisfactory heuristic for determining along which faces to perform cuts. The incision surface will be jagged; this problem is a subject of current research.

40|$|Abstract Tunnel boring {{machines}} (TBM) excavate tunnels with a circular cross section {{through a variety}} of rock strata. They can be used to bore through hard rock or sand and almost anything in between. Tunnel diameters can range from a metre (done with micro-TBMs) to 19 metres. Tunnel {{boring machines}} are used as an alternative to drilling and blasting (D&B) methods. A TBM has the advantages of not disturbing surrounding soil and producing a smooth tunnel wall. This significantly reduces the cost of lining the tunnel, and makes them suitable to use in built-up areas. The key disadvantage is cost. TBMs are expensive to construct, difficult to transport and require significant infrastructure. A tunnel boring machine (TBM) typically consists of one or two shields (large metal cylinders) and trailing support mechanisms. At {{the front end of the}} shield a rotating <b>cuttin...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract High speed {{cutting of}} {{hardened}} steel SKD 61 (HRC 53) became {{possible by the}} introduction of a sintered carbides endmill coated by (Al,Ti) N. According to machining experiments, typical tool life of this endmill cutter is about 320 m for straight line cutting. It becomes, however, only 30 m for inner cylindrical surface cutting of the radius ratio ro/r = 2 (r: cutter radius, ro: machined geometry radius), which is often used for the machining of die/mold. This short tool life is caused by the rapid increase of cutting force, temperature elevation on the cutting tool, and chip jamming, all of which are easily introduced at inner curve cutting. By applying the constant cutting force control technique, the tool life can be elongated to 110 m. To regulate the cutting force at a constant level, the feed forward control is used based on a mathematical model of cutting force.

In this paper, we draw on the program evaluation literature to provide a new approach to detecting collusion. Rather than using data on treatment assignment and outcomes to evaluate effects, we use theory to put structure on expected effects, and show how to infer treatment status from outcomes alone. Our approach clarifies many issues in the collusion literature; it rejects the validity of some existing approaches and uncovers new approaches not previously considered. We apply our approach to examine bidder behavior in Canadian timber auctions. Our application is of special relevance in light of recent developments in the long-standing U. S. -Canadian softwood lumber dispute, in which the market price for federally-owned Canadian timber is to be determined using data on the winning bids from previously held auctions.

Yet {{the history of}} tool development {{is one in which}} the interchange between those who work underground and those who labor on the surface has always been fruitful. From the time that antler horn was used to mine chert and flint, to be shaped into arrowheads and cutting tools, advances from one field have helped the other. Recent advances undertaken to improve rock cutting and drilling have found useful application in the manufacturing industries. Improvements in these areas, for surface use, may well have considerable benefit when applied to underground rock drilling.

An {{extension}} of 2 D Seam Carving [Avidan and Shamir, 2007] is presented, {{which allows for}} automatic resizing the duration of a video without interfering with the velocities of the objects in the scene.

40|$|PREFACE Most {{large scale}} {{optimization}} problems involve either column generation or constraint generation. An early example of column generation was the cutting stock problem by Gilmore and Gomory [10, 11] {{in which each}} column is generated by solving a knapsack problem. They observed a cyclic repetition {{of the values of}} nonbasic variables for the knapsack problem. The periodicity initiated the cyclic group problem and led Gomory [12] to the group problem for integer programming. Every knapsack problem may be relaxed to a cyclic group problem. The cyclic group relaxation is much smaller than the original knapsack problem, and is polyno-mial if the coefficients remain fixed while the right-hand side increases. But, it is not polynomial if the coefficients are allowed to increase. The cyclic group subproblem is equivalent to a shortest path problem in the corresponding circulant digraph. If the circulant digraph has a large number of nodes and a small diameter in its degree, the dynamic programming algorithm given by Gomory [12] will perform poorly as we will see on Wong-Coppersmith digraphs in this thesis.
