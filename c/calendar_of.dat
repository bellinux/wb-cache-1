5|$|A {{panelled}} stone {{structure in}} the church, carved with processions of bearded and robed figures under arches, seems to reproduce details found in the Book of Cerne, a work associated with Bishop Æthelwold of Lichfield (818–830).

5|$|In 1001, Edward's relics (for he was {{considered}} a saint, although never canonized) were translated to a more prominent place within the nunnery at Shaftesbury. The ceremonies {{are said to have}} been led by the then-Bishop of Sherborne, Wulfsige III, accompanied by a senior cleric whom the Passio calls Elsinus, sometimes identified with Ælfsige, the abbot of the New Minster, Winchester. King Æthelred, preoccupied with the threat of a Danish invasion, did not attend in person, but he issued a charter to the Shaftesbury nuns late in 1001 granting them lands at Bradford on Avon, which is thought to be related. A 13th-century <b>calendar</b> <b>of</b> saints gives the date of this translation as 20 June.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Ciudad de San Cristóbal, {{the capital}} of the Mexican state of Chiapas, was renamed San Cristóbal de Las Casas, in honor of its first bishop.

He is commemorated by the Church of England in the <b>Calendar</b> <b>of</b> Saints on July 20, The Episcopal Church (USA) on July 18, and at the Evangelical Lutheran Church on July 17. In the Catholic Church, the Dominicans introduced his cause for canonization in 1976. In 2002 the Church began the process for his beatification.|$|E

Known to have been a devout Anglican, she is commemorated on April 16 in the <b>calendar</b> <b>of</b> the Anglican Church of Canada and the Episcopal Church (USA).
