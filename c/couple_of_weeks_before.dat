5|$|The move to top team IFK Göteborg {{went well}} and Augustinsson played {{most of the}} games during the pre-season. When Svenska Cupen began in March, he was first-choice as left-back and played two games in the group stage. IFK Göteborg later won the cup against Djurgården in the final. Just a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the start of 2013 Allsvenskan, {{he picked up a}} knee injury while playing for Sweden U21 which kept him out of action for five months. On his Allsvenskan debut on 25 August 2013 in an away match against Malmö FF he {{suffered}} another injury, which meant that he would be out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Yellow Fever and How to Cure It was {{a three-part}} story by Robert Holmes {{that would have}} taken place in Singapore and {{featured}} the Autons as the monsters, with both the Rani and the Master appearing, the Brigadier would have also returned. The first episode was commissioned on 26 October 1984, before being put on hold. The entire story was subsequently commissioned on 6 February 1985, only a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> news of the planned hiatus broke. Nathan-Turner hoped to have Graeme Harper direct the adventure. After the news of the hiatus, Holmes was asked by the production team to continue with the story but as six 25 minute episodes, this version seeing the removal of the Master from the plot. Holmes reportedly only completed a story outline before the planned Season 23 was completely cancelled. The basic premise had the Master and the Rani operating under the guise of a travelling street theatre, the story would open with Peri seeing the Statue of Liberty on the scanner screen, and she would think she was back in America, only to find they were in a massive cultural garden with many miniature landmarks on display.|$|E

Immediately after the show Castillo took a cab to nearby Cedars Sinai Hospital where he collapsed as he was being admitted. The doctors discovered a duodenal ulcer that had ruptured his stomach and performed emergency surgery that saved Castillo’s life. While taking time off from Mötley Crüe to recover from his surgery, he discovered a small lump on his jaw and a month later, after it had grown to {{roughly the size of}} a golf ball, he sought treatment and was diagnosed with Squamous cell Carcinoma, a common form of cancer that is not usually fatal if it is discovered early but can spread rapidly if left untreated. The cancer went into remission in mid-2001, and he was rumored to be rejoining Osbourne's solo band for that summer Ozzfest tour (along with Geezer Butler on bass), though these rumors were later revealed to be untrue.|$|E

Homer would later feel guilt, believing that the incident prompted Mona to leave him and his father.

500|$|A <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> the NBA {{season was}} {{originally}} scheduled to start, Reuters and Bloomberg Businessweek speculated on {{the prospect of}} increased interest in the National Hockey League (NHL) among NBA fans.

Businessweek wrote, [...] "Just maybe, the NBA's sketchy situation is already having {{a positive effect on}} the NHL." [...] However several NHL teams (nearly half of which do not have an NBA team in their market) had no plans to market directly to NBA fans during the lockout.|$|E

A public apology eased tensions, but a miserable US tour in August that was marked by half-filled stadiums and subpar performances proved to be their last.

50|$|Violet-green {{swallows}} {{will usually}} arrive to their breeding area {{weeks prior to}} the start of reproduction. Location dependent, copulation takes place mid-May with the eggs being laid by the start of June, followed by a <b>couple</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> incubation <b>before</b> hatching. The average clutch size is 5 eggs, with females laying approximately 1 per day. During the weeks post-hatching, their parents feed the young as they slowly begin to grow their feathers. After approximately 3 weeks the young are ready to leave the nest. It is more common for pairs to reproduce once per breeding season, but a second brooding has been observed on occasion.|$|R
50|$|After auditioning around 120 people, the {{directors}} finally {{zeroed in on}} the seven cast members. Each actor brought in their own personality to make the characters more believable. To help the actors be as natural as possible, they used their real names and all the scenes were improvised so as to appear real. The actors were made to rehearse the whole film several times before they came on the sets. Akhlaque Khan (Akki) was {{not a part of the}} cast initially. However, with just a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> to go <b>before</b> the shoot, the actor assigned to play Akki's part bowed out and in came Akhlaque who, eventually won the award for the best actor at the St. Tropez International Film Festival, France St. Tropez International Film Festival, France 2013.|$|R

500|$|The cast {{found out}} a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> filming the episode that parts {{would be in}} animation. The {{animated}} portions were produced with Zoic Studios. Over an eight-week period, the studio defined the primary Fringe characters into their animated counterparts, and used footage of the actors and fight scene choreography to provide motion for the characters. The animators used a stand-in for Nimoy so {{that he did not}} have to fly to Vancouver from Los Angeles. The studio aimed to achieve a mixed look between stylized and authenticity to allow them to focus on animating the characters' emotions. The work also include recreating some of the settings already established from Fringe, such as Bell's office. Other parts of Olivia's dreamscape were handpainted scenes, projected onto 3D plates and used within the animation software. Andrew Orloff, Zoic's creative director commented, [...] "This project was one of the most intensive and rewarding we have worked on in Zoic’s history. It was an incredible undertaking, from the amazing writers at Fringe to the animation production that is both steeped in tradition and groundbreaking." [...] The episode ultimately contained sixteen minutes of animation; executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that the amount of man hours placed into the episode was [...] "by far" [...] the longest the series has had to date. The writers have cited Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Waltz with Bashir as influences for the episode.|$|E

Fogerty told Asylum Records to destroy the master tapes for Hoodoo sometime in the 1980s.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{two years}} now since Mackintosh had been {{appointed}} Walker's assistant. Walker, who had been {{for a quarter of}} a century administrator of Talua, one of the larger islands in the Samoan group, was a man known in person or by report through the length and breadth of the South Seas; and it was with lively curiosity that Mackintosh looked forward to his first meeting with him. For one reason or another he stayed a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> at Apia <b>before</b> he took up his post and both at Chaplin's hotel and at the English club he heard innumerable stories about the administrator. He thought now with irony of his interest in them. Since then he had heard them a hundred times from Walker himself. Walker knew that he was a character, and, proud of his reputation, deliberately acted up to it. He was jealous of his [...] "legend" [...] and anxious that you should know the exact details of any of the celebrated stories that were told of him. He was ludicrously angry with anyone who had told them to the stranger incorrectly.|$|R

In the meanwhile, the Sergeant, as he had indeed expected, met with a good many difficulties. He was supplied with plentiful information concerning the outlaws, but the trouble {{was that he could}} not always decide how much of {{it was meant to be}} misleading until he had acted upon it. After a week's hard riding, during which his men had very little sleep, he found himself one night with six of them rather more than sixty miles west of Prospect. He had that day surrounded what he had been told was one of the whisky boys' coverts in a big bluff, and [...] "drawn a blank," [...] a thing that had happened once or twice already. The horses were dead weary, the men worn-out, so he decided to camp where he was in a thick growth of willows. A cooking fire was lighted, and when the men had eaten, all but two, who were left to watch the horses, lay down, rolled in their blankets.|$|R

[...] De Niro obtained a cab driver's license, and when on break would pick up a cab and drive around New York for a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks,</b> <b>before</b> returning to Rome to resume filming 1900. De Niro apparently lost 35 pounds and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of Arthur Bremer. When he had time off from shooting 1900, De Niro visited an army base in Northern Italy and tape-recorded soldiers from the Midwestern United States, whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Travis's character.|$|E
