40|$|A {{compilation}} of Adrian Favell's innovative and agenda setting essays which, {{since the late}} 1990 s, have charted {{the emergence of new}} migration patterns and politics in Europe. Tackling in turn issues of multiculturalism, immigrant integration, free movement, high skilled mobilities, new East-West migrations and regional integration, the collection offers a comprehensive introduction to the dynamic field of international migration studies. At the same time, it poses a sharp challenge to current <b>complacencies,</b> challenging researchers to escape methodological nationalism and the unreflective reproduction of concepts and assumptions in the field, as well as embracing new methodologies and theoretical resources. Moving fluidly across intellectual boundaries as much as national borders, Favell points the way forward to new thinking in this burgeoning and rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field.

5|$|As {{the fields}} of ecology and {{environmental}} studies develop, exotic species attract more attention and their effects become more apparent. Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more <b>complacency</b> than alarm, as contemporary wisdom about them assumed the host environment would be largely immune.

5000|$|As a {{manifesto}} for the Negritude movement Damas’ introduction was more {{political and cultural}} in nature. A distinctive feature of Damas’s anthology and beliefs was that Damas felt that his message was one for the colonized in general, and included poets from Indochina and Madagascar. This is sharply in contrast to Senghor’s anthology which would be published two years later. In the introduction Damas proclaimed that now was the age where [...] "the colonized man becomes aware of his rights and of his duties as a writer, as a novelist or a storyteller, an essayist or a poet." [...] Damas explicitly outlines the themes of the anthology. He says, [...] "Poverty, illiteracy, exploitation of man by man, social and political racism suffered by the black or the yellow, forced labor, inequalities, lies, resignation, swindles, prejudices, <b>complacencies,</b> cowardice, failure, crimes committed {{in the name of}} liberty, of equality, of fraternity, that is the theme of this indigenous poetry in French."

5000|$|Although Cyril {{has also}} been popularly known as a gay poet, Singaporean critic Gwee Li Sui has {{stressed}} that readers need not perceive the poet's persona in terms of gay exceptionality: [...] "his qualities of spaciousness and morphing images also manifesting an interest {{in a kind of}} New-Age irreligious spirituality." [...] This interest is fully expressed in Cyril's book, Satori Blues, in which the author [...] "teases us out of our <b>complacencies</b> and directs/guides our thinking along the long, hard route to self-awareness...Hence 'blues'.

[...] In closer connection to the poet's Confessionalism, Andrew Howdle writes of the poems in The Lover's Inventory as having [...] "a sense of musical persona, a manner of singing, of intonation and expression, and are fully aware of how they confess through masks and make others reveal the masks that they wear." [...] In a review by the Southeast Asian Review of English, Cyril's work has been described as [...] "an art that works simply from a personal plane, and from within such a plane we have some of the most sensitive, articulate probings into the nature of one's self that have never been seen before in all of contemporary Singaporean verse." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the days}} prior to hitting Dominica, David was {{originally}} expected to hit Barbados and spare Dominica in the process.

Even as it became increasingly clear that David was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to <b>complacency</b> amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.|$|E
5|$|Robert Silverberg connects {{this account}} with {{historical}} events of 1141, when the Kara-Khitan Khanate under Yelü Dashi defeated the Seljuk Turks near Samarkand. The Seljuks ruled over Persia {{at the time}} and were the most powerful force in the Muslim world, and the defeat at Samarkand weakened them substantially. While the Kara-Khitan at the time were Buddhists and not Christian, {{and there is no reason}} to suppose Yelü Dashi was ever called Prester John. However, several vassals of the Kara-Khitan practiced Nestorian Christianity, which may have contributed to the legend, as well as the possibility that the Europeans, who were unfamiliar with Buddhism, assumed that if the leader was not Muslim, he must be Christian. The defeat encouraged the Crusaders and inspired a notion of deliverance from the East, and it is possible Otto recorded Hugh's confused report to prevent <b>complacency</b> in the Crusade's European backers; according to his account, no help could be expected from a powerful Eastern king.|$|E

40|$|Postmodernist {{perspectives}} in research {{have tended to}} embrace ambiguity, complexity, interconnectedness and contradiction, and have sometimes {{been described as a}} rejection of the ‘Grand Theories’ of Modernism. They have been said to reflect a view that previously taken-for-granted assumptions about the organizing principles of social phenomena must be regarded sceptically, and often make use of irony, or even absurdity in attempting to avoid the <b>complacencies</b> of the past. However, there are many instances in which models and explanatory frameworks within which research has been positioned are performing a useful role as metaphor, and have not been adopted naively or prescriptively. As travellers, we are usually aware that a map is not the territory it represents. However, as researchers, inquiring into practice, are we always aware of the domain within which that practice is situated? Descriptions of practice may sometimes mislead the uncritical eye. For instance, we can ask ourselves whether we believe that a chef actually cooks by following a recipe. Or is that recipe merely a formal description of a much more complex process drawing upon the chef’s contextual understandings of his ingredients, tools and skills in producing ‘food’? Possibly, only someone who does not know how to cook would think otherwise. We {{believe that there is a}} need for a critically-informed approach to research, i. e. one which specifically attempts to shed light upon taken-for-granted assumptions and naîve rationalities, illuminating metaphor and stimulating reflection. This ‘Hypermodernism’ includes recognition that ‘Grand Theories’ may be useful as metaphors, i. e. a basis for practical philosophy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} risk {{management}} practices in e-banking of major UK banks, using {{the framework of}} principles introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The initial pilot study involves four interviews conducted with staff members {{of one of the}} leading UK banks on risk management for e-banking. The main research instrument is a questionnaire divided into three sections covering board management and oversight, security controls and legal and reputational risk management. The questionnaire is used across ten major UK banks to establish whether they are operating in line with these risk management principles. The interviewees suggest that the main risk to customers using e-banking is security risk and that the bank is focussing on mitigating that risk. Our findings from the questionnaire indicate that the UK banks have successful risk management systems that help to stop potential electronic risk and reduce the losses incurred from risks associated with e-banking. Our results also confirm that UK banks are complying with the 14 BCBS risk principles and are well managed in terms of their security controls for e-banking. With the continued phenomenal growth and investment into e-banking we recommend that UK banks must avoid a repetition of the recent <b>complacencies</b> seen with on-line payments, corporate governance issues and the rising tide of complaints many that are referred to the financial ombudsman. They must also ensure they keep up-to-date security systems to reduce the security risk to different parties and that staff members are fully trained on legal and reputational risk management practices...|$|R

It wasn't in the least {{at the same time}} that encountered celebrities only thus provoked the shifting play of my small lamp, and this too even though they were easily celebrated, by my measure, and though from the very first I owed an individual here and there among them, as was highly proper, the benefit of impression at the highest pitch. On the great supporting and enclosing scene itself, the big generalised picture, painted in layer upon layer and tone upon tone, one's fancy was all the while feeding; objects and items, illustrations and aspects might perpetually overlap or mutually interfere, but never without leaving consistency the more marked and character the more unmistakeable. The place, the places, bristled so for every glance with expressive particulars, that I really conversed with them, at happy moments, more than with the figures that moved in them, which affected me so often as but submissive articles of furniture, [...] "put in" [...] by an artist duly careful of effect and yet duly respectful of proportion. The great impression was doubtless no other then and there than what it is under every sky and before every scene that remind one afresh, at the given moment, of all the ways in which producing causes and produced creatures correspond and interdepend; but I think I must have believed at that time that these cross references kept up their game in the English air with a frankness and a good faith that kept the process, in all probability, the most traceable of its kind on the globe.|$|R
5|$|The {{relationship}} between war and Australian {{society has been}} shaped {{by two of the}} more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture: bandwagoning with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare. Indeed, Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942, while since then an alliance with the United States has underwritten its security. Arguably, this pattern of bandwagoning—both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs, as well as for more pragmatic security concerns—has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies. Regardless, a tendency towards strategic <b>complacency</b> has also been evident, with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to allocate resources until a crisis arises; a trait which has historically resulted in unpreparedness for major military challenges.|$|E
5|$|Aston Villa {{won their}} sixth FA Cup in 1920, soon after though the club began a slow decline {{that led to}} Villa, at the time {{one of the most}} famous and {{successful}} clubs in world football, being relegated in 1936 for the first time to the Second Division. This was largely the result of a dismal defensive record: they conceded 110 goals in 42 games, 7 of them coming from Arsenal's Ted Drake in an infamous 1–7 defeat at Villa Park. Like all English clubs, Villa lost seven seasons to the Second World War, and that conflict brought several careers to a premature end. The team was rebuilt under the guidance of former player Alex Massie for the remainder of the 1940s. Aston Villa's first trophy for 37 years came in the 1956–57 season when another former Villa player, Eric Houghton led the club to a then record seventh FA Cup Final win, defeating the 'Busby Babes' of Manchester United in the final. The team struggled in the league though and were relegated two seasons later, due in large part to <b>complacency.</b> However, under the stewardship of manager Joe Mercer Villa returned to the top-flight in 1960 as Second Division Champions. The following season Aston Villa became the first team to win the Football League Cup.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the representation of}} nation and masculinity {{in the work of}} Australian authors Martin Boyd, Patrick White, Sumner Locke Elliott, and Christos Tsiolkas across the mid-late twentieth century and into the twenty-first. All these authors occupy distinct positions in Australian literature; their work crosses fiction and biography to articulate narratives of “outsider” subjectivity and experience that challenge cultural-nationalist formations. The first half of this thesis opens up a queer and transnational terrain of literary self-construction through the symbol of “Greece,” which it reads through Eve Sedgwick’s identification of the shared etymology of “queer” and trans-, to schematise the generative capacity of the always-already queer modalities of masculinity within cultural-nationalist imaginaries. Chapter One reads the self-producing capacities of “Greece” found throughout White’s oeuvre as coterminous with his late-career coming out, and connected to modalities of social critique. Chapter Two reads Greek-Australian author Christos Tsiolkas as inheritor of White’s capacity to “disturb national <b>complacencies.</b> ” It identifies Tsiolkas’s literary renegotiation of the nation within his evocation of maleness as marked by queer and migrant subjectivity. The second half of this thesis reads key aspects of critically under-read mid-century authors, Boyd and Elliott. By addressing their ambivalent position in literary criticism, this discussion reveals new frameworks for reading in the unrecognised dynamics of sexuality and identity in their writing, attenuated by the public/private cathexis of the closet. Chapter Three looks to Martin Boyd’s self-generating alignment with Rome and Classicism as expressing an ambiguous homosocial/sexual desire, centred on the eroticisation of the sacralised male form. Chapter Four reads Sumner Locke Elliott’s recurrent confrontation with scenes of origin. This analysis identifies Elliott’s ur-scene as a site of “backwards coming out” that significantly reorients Elliott’s origin story as queer narrative and critique of Australian society. The thesis demonstrates that together, these authors draw our attention to transnational and cosmopolitan scenes of literary significance, troubling and de-stabilising the coherent space of the nation. By realigning these authors in a genealogy of queer-transnational literature, this thesis argues for subverted dynamics of masculine national mythologisation...|$|R

About this poem Stevens wrote that it was [...] "simply an expression of paganism".A woman enjoying the comforts of staying home on Sunday morning begins to think about the requirements and the spiritual rewards of Christian belief. The main speaking voice in the poem describes the woman sinking deeper into meditation and expresses for her her own questioning of the sacrifices required by devout Christian belief. But, after doubting the myths of various religions, by the third section the speaker is asking the antagonistic rhetorical question, [...] "And shall the earth / Seem all of paradise that we shall know?" [...] The implied answer is that when the human race puts away its belief in [...] "mythy" [...] gods, the earth will become paradise. But then the woman begins to object: she wants an [...] "imperishable bliss", like Christianity promises its Elect. The main speaking voice replies with the shocking main theme of the poem: [...] "Death is the mother of beauty." [...] This statement of theme is a hyperbolic way of saying that everything humans experience and value exists in time and that fleetingness makes everything more valuable than it would be if it lasted unchanging forever. In the last three sections, the poet describes the beauties of earth as paradise.

5|$|The Sûreté's {{indirect}} {{penetration of}} military affairs involved linking the military intelligence service (SRM) to the Sûreté {{and the information}} provided by it, thereby making itself dependent on the political information and even political judgement and agenda of the civilian authorities.

As a result of the uprising, the SRM became more closely linked to the Sûreté and its methodology and philosophy in of analysing Vietnamese anti-colonial activity.

General Aubert cited <b>complacency</b> and laziness as a factor in the ineffectiveness of the officers in implement French intelligence strategy. He further asserted that the flow of intelligence between French officers and Vietnamese warrant officers was not as smooth as desired.

Aubert also believed that the Vietnamese troops were effective in hiding their anti-colonial sentiments from their French colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{most of the}} 11th century, the Byzantine navy faced few challenges. The Muslim threat had receded, {{as their}} navies {{declined}} and relations between the Fatimids, especially, and the Empire were largely peaceful. The last Arab raid against imperial territory was recorded in 1035 in the Cyclades, and was defeated in the next year. Another Rus' attack in 1043 was beaten back with ease, and {{with the exception of}} a short-lived attempt to recover Sicily under George Maniakes, no major naval expeditions were undertaken either. Inevitably, this long period of peace and prosperity led to <b>complacency</b> and neglect of the military. Already in the reign of Basil II (976–1025), the defence of the Adriatic was entrusted to the Venetians. Under Constantine IX (1042–1055), both the army and navy were reduced as military service was increasingly commuted in favour of cash payments, resulting in an increased dependency upon foreign mercenaries. The large thematic fleets declined and were replaced by small squadrons subject to the local military commanders, geared more towards the suppression of piracy than towards confronting a major maritime foe.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} {{effect of the}} war was a psychological one. The heavy losses deeply affected many directly, and war memorials were built all over the country as people sought to remember those that had been killed. However, despite the size of Australia's contribution to the fighting, there were many Australians who had had no actual experience of it. Realising this, and having witnessed the impact of the war first hand, Charles Bean, who was instrumental in editing and writing the official history of Australia's involvement in the war, advocated the need for a national memorial {{and was one of the}} main architects in establishing the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. The experience of the war also perpetuated many notions about the Australian character and national identity that endure to this day. For many Australians the performance of their soldiers—particularly during the failed Gallipoli campaign—served to highlight the nation's emergence as a member of the international community, while bringing to the fore a belief in Australians' natural ability as soldiers. The attitudes of many Australians towards war itself were also greatly affected. There was a widespread revulsion at the large-scale destruction and loss of life that had occurred and a desire that it should never occur again. In many regards this led to a general <b>complacency</b> towards defence and military matters after the war and arguably led to the nation's lack of preparedness for the next major conflict, while it may still be evident in Australian strategic behaviour to this day.|$|E

Amiabilities and absurdities, harmless serenities and vanities, pretensions and undertakings unashamed, still profited by the mildness of the critical air and the benignity of the social--on the right side at least of the social line. It had struck me from the first that nowhere so much as in England was it fortunate to be fortunate, and that against that condition, once it had somehow been handed down and determined, a number of the sharp truths that one might privately apprehend beat themselves beautifully in vain. I say beautifully for I confess without scruple to have found again and again at that time an attaching charm in the general exhibition of enjoyed immunity, paid for as it was almost always by the personal amenity, the practice of all sorts of pleasantness; if it kept the gods themselves for the time in good-humour, one was willing enough, or at least I was, to be on the side of the gods. Unmistakable too, as I seem to recover it, was the positive interest of watching and noting, roundabout one, for the turn, or rather for the blest continuity, of their benevolence: such an appeal proceeded, in this, that and the other particular case, from the fool's paradise really rounded and preserved, before one's eyes, for those who were so good as to animate it. There was always the question of how long they would be left to, and the growth of one's fine suspense, not to say one's frank little gratitude, as the miracle repeated itself.|$|R

6000|$|He {{had given}} her all his attention, and with this {{impression}} for her, again, that he was, in essence, fairly reaching out to her for time--time, only time--she could sufficiently imagine, and to whatever strangeness, that he absolutely liked her to talk, even {{at the cost of}} his losing almost everything else by it. It was still, for a minute, as if he waited for something worse; wanted everything that was in her to come out, any definite fact, anything more precisely nameable, so that he too--as was his right--should know where he was. What stirred in him above all, while he followed in her face the clear train of her speech, must have been the impulse to take up something she put before him that he was yet afraid directly to touch. He wanted to make free with it, but had to keep his hands off--for reasons he had already made out; and the discomfort of his privation yearned at her out of his eyes with an announcing gleam of the fever, the none too tolerable chill, of specific recognition. She affected him as speaking more or less for her father as well, and his eyes might have been trying to hypnotise her into giving him the answer without his asking the question. [...] "Had HE his idea, and has he now, with you, anything more?"--those were the words he had to hold himself from not speaking and that she would as yet, certainly, do nothing to make easy. She felt with her sharpest thrill how he was straitened and tied, and with the miserable pity of it her present conscious purpose of keeping him so could none the less perfectly accord. To name her father, on any such basis of anxiety, of compunction, would be to do the impossible thing, to do neither more nor less than give Charlotte away. Visibly, palpably, traceably, he stood off from this, moved back from it as from an open chasm now suddenly perceived, but which had been, between the two, with so much, so strangely much else, quite uncalculated. Verily it towered before her, this history of their confidence. They had built strong and piled high--based as it was on such appearances--their conviction that, thanks to her native <b>complacencies</b> of so many sorts, she would always, quite to the end and through and through, take them as nobly sparing her. Amerigo was at any rate having the sensation of a particular ugliness to avoid, a particular difficulty to count with, that practically found him as unprepared as if he had been, like his wife, an abjectly simple person. And she meanwhile, however abjectly simple, was further discerning, for herself, that, whatever he might have to take from her--she being, on her side, beautifully free--he would absolutely not be able, for any qualifying purpose, to name Charlotte either. As his father-in-law's wife Mrs. Verver rose between them there, for the time, in august and prohibitive form; to protect her, defend her, explain about her, was, at the least, to bring her into the question--which would be by the same stroke to bring her husband. But this was exactly the door Maggie wouldn't open to him; on all of which she was the next moment asking herself if, thus warned and embarrassed, he were not fairly writhing in his pain. He writhed, on that hypothesis, some seconds more, for it was not till then that he had chosen between what he could do and what he couldn't.|$|R
