40|$|In today’s {{unstable}} {{political and}} economic situation {{in the country is}} increasing the threat of losing financial <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> domestic <b>enterprises,</b> which may subsequently lead to bankruptcy, whose effectiveness as a means of restoring solvency and getting rid of debt depends on the procedures performed in the course of its realization. In connection with this, the author of the article research essence, peculiarities and consequences of bankruptcy procedures in comparative aspect. As a result, of the characteristics of judicial bankruptcy proceedings, found that the application of appropriate procedures, readjustment, liquidation or settlement agreement may have both positive and negative consequences for the debtor company and could restore the solvency of the company and its business continuation or termination of its existence through liquidation. It is inappropriate {{to determine the effects of}} the procedure only disposition of property, which is a kind of phase transition to the next procedure and has no concrete results for the debtor. Having reviewed the features of pretrial bankruptcy pretrial readjustment was defined its main advantages in comparison with judicial readjustment to ensure its higher effectiveness, efficiency and profitability effects for the company and for the creditors. Results of the study indicate that the introduction judicial and pre-trial procedures is a complicated and important process which requires further research and settlement of uncertain in legislatio...|$|R
50|$|At {{the return}} of the Long Parliament, in derision called the Rump, Walton rose again to greater power and {{authority}} than he had possessed before the Protectorate, and having seen the fate of a nation governed by an army, he took a decided part with Parliament, in preference to the military; and they trusted to him as one of those that were to counterpoise General George Monck; but he had no political <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> such an <b>enterprise,</b> and seeing, what he most feared, that the monarchy would be restored, he prudently retired to the continent, and settled at Hanau, in Germany, of which he was elected a burgess; but knowing the extreme hatred the royal family, especially the queen dowager, had to him, he left that town, and hid himself in the garb of a gardener in Flanders, and did not reveal his whereabouts until just before his death in 1661. Occasioned, no doubt, from the many misfortunes which overwhelmed him, and the dread of still greater.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{home network}} {{comprising}} many heterogeneous devices requires a scaleable interconnect capable of satisfying the often vastly different network resource {{demands of the}} devices. In addition, {{it is likely that}} over time the configuration of the network will change as new devices are added to the network and older ones removed or replaced. While it is acceptable <b>for</b> <b>enterprise</b> networks to be managed by a trained network administrator it is unreasonable to expect a home owner to have such expertise. Consequently, a free topology network coupled with a <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> plug and play that allows nodes to be added anywhere, and at any time without interruption to the operation of the networked system are essential requirements. IEEE 1355 standard technology has the potential to satisfy these criteria. The demand for a free topology and a <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> plug and play require that the configuration of the network is re-discovered and mapped automatically, and at regular intervals. This paper describes such a configuration mapping process. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the productive capacity of five villages namely Gimagaan, Sevilla, Sogoy, Milagrosa and Saclayan in Sorsogon, Philippines. Specifically, it aimed to assess the productive resource base, resource use and livelihood patterns and provide management prescriptions in the transition of farms into organic agriculture. Sustainable livelihoods analysis and participatory rapid appraisal were the analytical frameworks used in the study. Result of the study revealed that Gimagaan village had the greatest access to asset capitals compared to the other four villages in Sorsogon, Philippines. Gimagaan village highly benefited from the presence of socio-civic and government organizations, residents are more socially inclined and actively involved in the various social activities, have generally good access to their natural resource stocks and infrastructure facilities. On sustainability assessment, results revealed that Milagrosa village was more capable of sustaining management systems of its natural resources, highly resilient against perturbations and had greater chances of improving <b>capacities</b> <b>for</b> social development <b>enterprises.</b> Saclayan village on the other hand, had the lowest access to asset capitals and lowest score in terms of sustainability indicators. Management prescriptions include introduction of farming and fishing technologies which do not require intensive capital; conduct of an in-depth study of fishery-based livelihood project; strengthening the establishment of community-based sanctuaries and mangrove areas; introduction of crop-diversification farming system; and strengthening of the production-market linkage for fishery-based livelihood projects.   </p...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the second}} {{publication}} from the Bankwest Foundation Social Impact Series and includes preliminary findings from the Supporting Development and Growth in the Community Sector in Western Australia research program. This report is the first output of the Social Enterprise Financial Resilience project, which forms part of the program. Despite increasing interest in social enterprise, there is limited understanding about the factors that support the <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> social <b>enterprise</b> to deliver social objectives. In particular, we know little about how social enterprises access and use financial and other resources to sustain their businesses and how this can influence their organisational resilience. There are suggestions that social enterprise and small private for-profit businesses face similar barriers to accessing commercial finance (Burkett, 2010; Mavra, 2011). However, there are also factors specific to social enterprise – related to their organisational structures, their business purposes, and their operating environments - that influence how social enterprises attract, use and choose financial and other resources. With regard to financial resources, there is growing interest in and popular discussion about social finance in general and impact investing in particular. Yet, the financial needs, barriers and effects of certain forms of finance on social enterprise resilience and impact remains unclear. The purpose of this report is to review the existing evidence about the resource needs and behaviours of social enterprises, and their barriers and opportunities to accessing financial and other resources. We augment this review with comments from workshops and interviews undertaken with 15 Western Australian social entrepreneurs, and seven social financiers and policy professionals in May-June 2015. Unpacking the financial needs and behaviours of social enterprises provides a platform for {{better understanding of the}} factors that affect financial resilience of social enterprises in Western Australia and beyond, and the tools we need to support such resilience. Of course, organisational sustainability requires access to resources beyond finance; we consider in this report wider resourcing needs and their implications for financial resilience.  ...|$|R
