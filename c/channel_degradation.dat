The single-hop PU-HREQ packet informs the neighbor nodes that the PU's activity has been detected on a special channel and directs them to select another unused channel for data transmission. On the other hand, the HREQ is applied to inform the next hop node that the current link is breaking due to node mobility or <b>channel</b> quality <b>degradation.</b> If <b>channel</b> handoff occurs and no more empty channel is available to maintain the route, local flow handoff, a preemptive approach to address the route breaking, is applied.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to conduct a field-oriented evaluation, coupled with {{advanced}} laboratory techniques, of <b>channel</b> <b>degradation</b> in a stream of the Deep Loess Region of western Iowa, namely Mud Creek. The Midwestern United States is an ideal place for such a study considering that ~$ 1 Billion of infrastructure and farmland has been lost recently to <b>channel</b> <b>degradation.</b> A common form of <b>channel</b> <b>degradation</b> in this region is associated with the formation of knickpoints, which naturally manifest as short waterfalls within the channel that migrate upstream. As flow plunges over a knickpoint face, scouring of the downstream bed creates a plunge pool. This downcutting increases bank height, facilitating bank failure, stream widening, and damage to critical bridge infrastructure. We conducted a state-of-the-art geotechnical analysis of the sediments from the knickpoint face, plunge pool, and adjacent stream banks to determine the areas of the streambed near the bridge infrastructure that favor knickpoint propagation. Soil characterization using particle size distributions and Gamma Spectroscopy identified a stratigraphic discontinuity at the elevation where the knickpoint forms. An automated surveillance camera was established to monitor the location of the knickpoint face relative to a fixed datum and provide a first-order approximation of its migration rate, which was approximately 0. 9 m over a 248 -day study period. Surveys conducted of the stream reach also facilitated information about knickpoint migration. Flow measurements using Largescale Particle Image Velocimetry were conducted during the study to understand the hydrodynamic conditions at the site. The results of this research will assist local and federal transportation agencies in better understanding the following: (1) principal geotechnical and hydrodynamic factors that control knickpoint propagation, (2) identify necessary data for extraction and analysis to predict knickpoint formation, (3) provide mitigation measures such as grade control structures (e. g., sheet-pile weirs, bank stabilization measures) near bridge crossings to control the propagation of knickpoints and prevent further damage to downstream infrastructure...|$|E
