5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} the {{accident}} site at Parkside, the train passed {{a group of}} uniformed men walking along the railway carrying a variety of objects. It later transpired {{that this was the}} band, who had left their wagon when it had been commandeered to carry the injured Huskisson. The train which had carried the Duke of Wellington to Roby had not had space for them, and had left them to wait for the other trains which they believed were following. The band had eventually given up waiting and walked home, along a grass verge that was turning to mud under the heavy rain.

Many of the guests had planned to return home in daylight following the completion of the journey, and set out into the pitch-black city in search of somewhere to sleep.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} a simple intercarrier interfer-ence (ICI) {{suppression}} scheme that linearly combines the inter-symbol interference (ISI) -free part of a cyclic prefix (CP) and its corresponding part in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplex-ing (OFDM) signal to soothe the ICI effect caused by a time-varying channel. In contrast with existing heuristic <b>combining</b> <b>weights</b> in the literature for ICI suppression, we derived three sets of optimum <b>combining</b> <b>weights</b> in different aspects. Through simu-lations, we show that the proposed <b>combining</b> <b>weights</b> outperform other existing heuristic <b>combining</b> <b>weights.</b> In addition, a simpli-fied implementation is introduced to reduce the computational complexity of combining. Furthermore, the proposed methods can be incorporated with other ICI mitigation methods to further improve the system performance.

40|$|The {{real-time}} array feed {{compensation system}} {{is currently being}} evaluated at DSS 13. This system recovers signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss due to mechanical antenna deformations by using an array of seven Ka-band (33. 7 -GHz) horns to collect the defocused signal fields. The received signals are downconverted and digitized, in-phase and quadrature samples are generated, and <b>combining</b> <b>weights</b> are applied before the samples are recombined. It is shown that when optimum <b>combining</b> <b>weights</b> are employed, the SNR of the combined signal approaches {{the sum of the}} channel SNR's. The optimum <b>combining</b> <b>weights</b> are estimated directly from the signals in each channel by the Real-Time Block 2 (RTB 2) correlator; since it was designed for very-long-baseline interferometer (VLBI) applications, it can process broadband signals as well as tones to extract the required weight estimates. The estimation algorithms for the optimum <b>combining</b> <b>weights</b> are described for tones and broadband sources. Data recorded in correlator output files can also be used off-line to estimate combiner performance by estimating the SNR in each channel, which was done for data taken during a Jupiter track at DSS 13...|$|R

5|$|The British had {{maintained}} a blockade off Malta {{since the beginning}} of the siege, ostensibly led by Rear-Admiral Lord Nelson, who by March 1800 was defying a direct order from his superior officer Lord Keith by remaining in Palermo with his lover Emma, Lady Hamilton. In his absence the blockade was under the command of Captain Manley Dixon of HMS Lion and Nelson's flag captain Sir Edward Berry, who were notified of Decrés' departure by the patrolling frigate HMS Penelope and gave chase. The large ship of the line was initially only attacked by Penelope, which manoeuvered around Guillaume Tells stern, causing severe damage and delaying the French ship sufficiently for Berry to bring his squadron into action. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Decrés continued to fight for more than three hours, fighting off two British ships but ultimately unable to resist the <b>combined</b> <b>weight</b> of Berry's attacks. Casualties and damage were severe on both sides, and the defiance of the French ship was celebrated in both countries as a brave defence against overwhelming odds.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:00, {{the runway}} at Khâm Đức was cleared of the wrecked helicopter. Moments later, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Daryl D. Cole touched {{down on the}} runway under heavy fire, which flattened one tire and caused extensive damage to the wing tanks. Almost immediately, Cole's aircraft was rushed by hysterical Vietnamese civilians from ditches along the runway, filling the aircraft so the loadmaster was prevented from unloading the aircraft's cargo. Under heavy fire, Cole decided to navigate his aircraft down the cratered and shrapnel-littered runway, {{in order to take}} off. However, the <b>combined</b> <b>weight</b> of the cargo and civilians, in addition to the damage sustained during landing, prevented the aircraft from gathering enough speed to take off. So the aircrew aborted the take off, offloaded the civilians, and proceeded to cut off the blown tire to stop it from flapping and slowing down the aircraft. They were able to cut off the rubber with the bayonet, and were able to cut through the steel beading thanks to the engineers carefully cutting the steel cords with a blowtorch. A fire extinguisher was kept handy because of fear of catching the magnesium wheel on fire. About two hours later, realizing that enemy artillery rounds were coming closer to his aircraft, Colonel Cole tried to take off for the second time, and managed to get the C-130 into the air. This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is calculated}} by a dietitian for each child. Age, weight, activity levels, culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan. First, the energy requirements are set at 80–90% of the recommended daily amounts (RDA) for the child's age (the high-fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high-carbohydrate diet). Highly active children {{or those with}} muscle spasticity require more calories than this; immobile children require less. The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the <b>combined</b> <b>weight</b> of carbohydrate and protein. This is typically 4:1, but children who are younger than 18months, older than 12years, or who are obese may be started on a 3:1 ratio. Fat is energy-rich, with 9kcal/g (38kJ/g) compared to 4kcal/g (17kJ/g) for carbohydrate or protein, so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal. The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio. Next, the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance, and are around 1g protein for each kg of body weight. Lastly, the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio. Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance. The total daily amount of fat, protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals.|$|E

As a contribution to the probability theory, our findings extend Lee & Hu's (1996) recent investigation on the distribution of the linear compound of two independent F-variates. In terms of relevant applied works, our results refine Dickinson's (1973) inquiry on the distribution of the optimal <b>combining</b> <b>weights</b> estimates based on combining two independent rival forecasts, and provide a further advancement to the general case of combining three independent competing forecasts.

40|$|Abstract—While weight noise {{injection}} {{during training}} {{has been adopted}} in attaining fault tolerant neural networks (NNs), theoretical and empirical studies on the online algorithms developed based on these strategies {{have yet to be}} complete. In this paper, we present results on two important aspects in online learning algorithms based on <b>combining</b> <b>weight</b> noise injection and weight decay. Through intensive computer simulations, the convergence behaviors of those algorithms and the performance of the NNs generated by these algorithms are elucidated. It is found that (i) the online learning algorithm based on purely multiplicative weight noise injection does not converge, (ii) the algorithms <b>combining</b> <b>weight</b> noise injection and weight decay exhibit better convergence behaviors than their pure weight noise injection counterparts, and (iii) the neural networks attained by those algorithms <b>combining</b> <b>weight</b> noise injection and weight decay show better fault tolerance abilities than the neural networks attained by the pure weight noise injection-based algorithms. These empirical results not just can supplement our recent work done on the convergence behaviors of the weight noise injection-based learning algorithms [16], but also provide new information on effect of weight noise and weight decay on the neural networks that are generated by these algorithms...|$|R

25|$|Skeletons {{have also}} been {{discovered}} with gastroliths, stones, in their stomachs, though whether to help break down food, especially cephalopods, in a muscular gizzard, or to vary buoyancy, or both, has not been established. However, the total weight of the gastroliths found in various specimens appear to be insufficient to modify the buoyancy of these large reptiles. The first plesiosaur gastroliths, found with Mauisaurus gardneri, were reported by Harry Govier Seeley in 1877. The number of these stones per individual is often very large. In 1949, a fossil of Alzadasaurus (specimen SDSM 451, later renamed to Styxosaurus) showed 253 of them. Also, the size of individual stones is often considerable. In 1991 an elasmosaurid specimen was investigated, KUVP 129744, containing a gastrolith with a diameter of seventeen centimetres and a weight of 1.3 kilogramme; and a somewhat shorter stone of 1490 gram. In total forty-seven gastroliths were present with a <b>combined</b> <b>weight</b> of thirteen kilogramme.

25|$|The RAN {{commenced}} {{plans to}} improve their frigates' combat capability in 1996, with the Warfighting Improvement Program (WIP). Upgrades proposed under the WIP included installation of a phased-array radar, a second Mark 41 vertical launch system. The WIP was scrapped {{near the end of}} 1999, and plans for a less ambitious anti-ship missile defence (ASMD) upgrade were made. In 2004, Tenix, Saab, and the Department of Defence formed a Private Public Partnership to upgrade the anti-ship missile defence (ASMD) capability of the Anzac class, through the installation of CEA Technologies' CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT phased array radars, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye Navigational Radar Systems. On 18 January 2010, Perth docked at the Australian Marine Complex in Henderson, Western Australia for the ASMD upgrade. Both of the frigate's masts were replaced, and the operations room layout was improved. Additional ballast was required to maintain stability, and the <b>combined</b> <b>weight</b> increase brought the ship's full load displacement to 3,810 tons. After completion in October 2010, Perth was used to test the modifications, with trials completed in July 2011.

25|$|As in the Pear Trench sector, {{the tanks}} {{assigned}} {{to support the}} attack on Hamel had not arrived {{by the time the}} infantry reached the line of departure, which meant that they had to attack without armoured support. As the 43rd went in straight against the defences, some of the German defenders began withdrawing. As elements of the 43rd outflanked the German positions in the village through the edge of Notamel Wood, heavy fighting broke out in Hamel and one group of Australians, along with their attached American platoon, killed 15 Germans and captured another 40. Meanwhile, the 44th went in against the German trenches along the ridge line to the south. There, after the tanks finally arrived, they took large numbers of prisoners as they cleared out the trenches. Around Notamel Wood, resistance was initially heavy as the German positions were well-sited to provide interlocking fields of fire.
