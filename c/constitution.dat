5|$|In 1919, {{after the}} {{occupation}} of the country by the Russian Bolsheviks, Belarus became a Soviet Republic (USSR), and a new <b>constitution</b> was adopted. Belarus continued to use this <b>constitution</b> until it – along with Russia, Ukraine, and the Transcaucasus – signed a treaty to form the Soviet Union. Now the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR), the country adopted its first Soviet-era <b>constitution</b> in 1927, complementing the recently adopted Soviet <b>Constitution.</b> After a re-adoption in 1937, the Byelorussian SSR adopted its last Soviet-era <b>constitution</b> in 1978, mainly to reflect changes made in the 1977 Soviet <b>Constitution.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Florida <b>Constitution</b> of 1838 {{provided}} that a governor be elected every four years, {{who was not}} allowed to serve consecutive terms. The secessionist <b>constitution</b> of 1861 would have reduced this to two years and removed the term limit, but the state fell to the Union before the first election under that <b>constitution.</b> The rejected <b>constitution</b> of 1865 and the ratified <b>constitution</b> of 1868 maintained the four-year term, though without the earlier term limit, which was reintroduced in the 1885 <b>constitution.</b> The current <b>constitution</b> of 1968 states that should the governor serve, or would have served had he not resigned, more than six years in two consecutive terms, he cannot be elected to the succeeding term. The start of a term was set in 1885 at the first Tuesday after the first Monday in the January following the election, where it has remained.|$|E

50|$|On the surface, the <b>constitutions</b> resembled many <b>constitutions</b> {{adopted in}} the West. The {{differences}} between Soviet and Western <b>constitutions,</b> however, overshadow the similarities. Soviet <b>constitutions</b> declared certain political rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion. They also identified a series {{of economic and social}} rights, as well as a set of duties of all citizens. The legislature was to be elected at periodical elections.|$|R
5|$|Abu Bakar promuglated the Johor State Establishment <b>Constitution</b> (Malay: Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor), {{drafted by}} Abdul Rahman Andak, on 14 April 1895. The state's <b>constitution</b> {{was seen as}} a turning point by many as a step in laying the groundwork for the {{administration}} of Johor. It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminet death in light of his failing health, promogulated the state <b>constitution</b> with the intent of preserving the state's independence in the light of growing British political influence in the Malay states.|$|E
5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about the new <b>Constitution</b> and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives in the December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the <b>Constitution,</b> a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the <b>Constitution,</b> a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the <b>Constitution,</b> with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E
5|$|After Lukashenko {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} in 1994, he stated his intention to amend the recently passed <b>Constitution.</b> The amendments, according to Lukashenko, would expand {{the power of his}} office, marking a turning point in post-Soviet era politics in Belarus. A May 1995 national referendum was {{the first step in the}} amendment process. Out of the four questions, one asked if the president could disband parliament if the members violate national law. The vote, which several Supreme Soviet deputies protested, resulted in 77% in favor of the provision regarding the dismissal of the legislature by the president. Other questions on the ballot, such as the national flag and national emblem, didn't affect the <b>Constitution</b> as a whole, but their status has been decided by the <b>Constitution.</b> Two years later, Lukashenko scheduled the first referendum that would potentially alter the <b>Constitution.</b> The last referendum on the <b>Constitution</b> occurred in 2004, also scheduled by Lukashenko.|$|E
40|$|The Anglo-Austrahan {{legal system}} has not readily {{recognised}} Indigenous <b>constitutions.</b> The {{absence of such}} recognition does not, however, deny that Australia&# 039;s Indigenous nations have had <b>constitutions</b> {{for thousands of years}} and continue to do so. In this article, we explain how Indigenous laws, institutions and systems of authority are constitutional. Using the <b>constitutions</b> of the Gunditjmara peoples and Ngarrindjeri nation as examples, we identify three dimensions of Indigenous <b>constitutions</b> in Australia: first, the foundation of Indigenous <b>constitutions</b> in the continuing and inherent authority of Indigenous nations; secondly constitutional features deriving from Indigenous law; and thirdly the use in Indigenous <b>constitutions</b> of institutions and processes that also have status under Australian law. We suggest that this new understanding of Indigenous <b>constitutions</b> provides a basis for contributing to current efforts in Indigenous constitution-making and {{to the development of a}} more inclusive understanding of the Australian constitutional system...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the independence <b>constitutions</b> of Asia and Africa {{in the twentieth}} cen-tury through a macro-comparative lens. The examination focuses upon the intra-imperial isomorphic thesis which proposes that newly independent countries, in formulating their <b>constitutions,</b> merely imitated the constitutional form of their former mother country. I find that while independent <b>constitutions</b> indeed imitated the <b>constitutions</b> of their former moth-er country, this mimicry was neither universal nor whole scale. It occurred foremost {{in terms of the}} constitutional provisions for governmental system. Conversely, {{at least half of the}} independence <b>constitutions</b> in Asia and Africa had provisions for religion, rights, and/or political parties that ran counter to the constitutional model of the former mother country. These countervailing tendencies to the logic of intra-imperial isomorphism reveal crucial trans-imperial influences on the making of modern postcolonial <b>constitutions...</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{a strong}} proponent {{for a new}} <b>constitution,</b> White helped Queen Liliʻuokalani draft the 1893 <b>Constitution</b> of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Nāwahī was the other {{principal}} author, and Samuel Nowlein, captain of the Household Guard, was another contributor. These three had been meeting with the queen in secret since August 1892 after attempts to abrogate the Bayonet <b>Constitution</b> by legislative decision through a constitutional convention had proved largely unsuccessful. The proposed <b>constitution</b> would increase {{the power of the}} monarchy, restore voting rights to economically disenfranchised Native Hawaiians and Asians, and remove the property qualification for suffrage imposed by the Bayonet <b>Constitution,</b> among other changes. On the afternoon of January14, after the knighting ceremony of White and Nāwahī and the prorogation of the legislature, members of Hui Kālaiʻāina and a delegation of native leaders marched to ʻIolani Palace with a sealed package containing the <b>constitution.</b> According to William DeWitt Alexander, this was pre-planned by the queen to take place while she met with her newly appointed cabinet ministers in the Blue Room of the palace. She was attempting to promulgate the <b>constitution</b> during the recess of the legislative assembly. However, these ministers, including Samuel Parker, William H. Cornwell, John F. Colburn, and Arthur P. Peterson, were either opposed to or reluctant to support the new <b>constitution.</b>|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} state, the <b>constitution</b> of 1816 {{began to be}} criticized. Opponents claimed the <b>constitution</b> had too many appointed positions, the terms established were inadequate, {{and some of the}} clauses were too easily manipulated by the political parties that did not exist when then <b>constitution</b> was written. The first <b>constitution</b> had not been put to a vote by the general public, and following the great population growth in the state, it was seen as inadequate. A constitutional convention was called in January 1851 to create a new one. The new <b>constitution</b> was approved by the convention on February 10, 1851, and submitted for a vote to the electorate that year. It was approved and has since been the official <b>constitution.</b>|$|E
