5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} the optic nerve and {{the contents of the}} <b>cavernous</b> sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs the blood supply to the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{from here}} drains {{into the left}} and right {{transverse}} sinuses. These then drain into the sigmoid sinuses, which receive blood from the <b>cavernous</b> sinus and superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. The sigmoid drains into the large internal jugular veins.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} {{the skull}} base known as the <b>cavernous</b> sinus. This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the oculomotor nerve (the third cranial nerve), which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively. The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The <b>cavernous</b> sinus also contains the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E
5|$|Almost all his {{seventeen}} San Francisco seasons {{concluded with}} Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Monteux's SFSO studio recordings were mainly {{made in the}} <b>cavernous</b> acoustics of War Memorial Opera House (without an audience) with the music transmitted over telephone wires to a Los Angeles studio and recorded on film there. Confined to the USA for {{the years of the}} Second World War, in 1942 Monteux took American citizenship.|$|E
5|$|One day, when Alibaba goes to cut wood, he chances {{upon the}} <b>cavernous</b> hideout of Abu Hussain, the notorious leader of forty dacoits, and overhears the secret code {{to enter and}} exit the cave. After the dacoits leave, Alibaba uses the code word, enters the hideout, and takes some of the cave's wealth which he uses to help poor people nearby. Both Alibaba and Marziana become wealthy overnight.|$|E
5|$|The Watten {{site was}} {{captured}} on 4 September 1944 by Canadian forces. The Germans had evacuated {{it a few}} days earlier and removed the pumps which kept the <b>cavernous</b> basement free from water; not long afterwards it began to flood. This made a substantial amount of the bunker inaccessible to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{projection}} dome was {{separate from}} the outer dome, and was 23 meters (75.4ft) in diameter. Made of curved aluminum sheets, it was lap jointed to create a continuous spherical surface. The sheets were painted white and perforated with 2.5-millimeter (0.1inch) holes, which were designed to let sound through and reduced echoes in the <b>cavernous</b> space.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in intracranial pressure {{may lead to}} impairment of the optic nerves (II) due to compression of the surrounding veins and capillaries, causing swelling of the eyeball (papilloedema). A cancer, such as an optic glioma, may also impact the optic nerve (II). A pituitary tumour may compress the optic tracts or the optic chiasm of the optic nerve (II), leading to visual field loss. A pituitary tumour may also extend into the <b>cavernous</b> sinus, compressing the oculuomotor nerve (III), trochlear nerve (IV) and abducens nerve (VI), leading to double-vision and strabismus. These nerves may also be affected by herniation of the temporal lobes of the brain through the falx cerebri.|$|E
5|$|The {{blood in}} the deep {{part of the brain}} drains, through a venous plexus into the <b>cavernous</b> sinus at the front, and the {{superior}} and inferior petrosal sinuses at the sides, and the inferior sagittal sinus at the back. Blood drains from the outer brain into the large superior saggital sinus, which rests in the midline on top of the brain. Blood from here joins with blood from the straight sinus at the confluence of sinuses.|$|E
5|$|The chapel {{beneath its}} large onion dome {{is dark and}} <b>cavernous</b> and {{decorated}} with carved giltwood, the detailing highlighted in red, green, blue and pink, by the Portuguese sculptor Silvestre Faria Lobo. The upper level has galleries {{for the use of}} royal personages who would sit apart from the congregation. One of these galleries contains a small Rococo pipe organ. A feature of the chapel is the ornate portable font, its marble basin resting in an elaborate Rococo frame surmounted by a carved wood cover.|$|E
5|$|The museum's {{first floor}} main gallery space houses the {{permanent}} exhibitions. These {{consist of a}} chronological display which runs around the gallery's 200m perimeter and six thematic displays in 'silos' within the space. The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of an hourly audiovisual presentation, the Big Picture. The main gallery, described as <b>cavernous</b> and dramatic, includes objects such as a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8A Harrier jet, and a British 13-pounder field gun which fired the British Army's first shot of the First World War. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions, mounted in a separate gallery.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent <b>cavernous</b> sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
5|$|The brain-like surface folds {{and mature}} olive-brown gleba are {{characteristic}} of Calvatia craniiformis, but younger puffballs {{that have not yet}} developed these characteristics may be difficult to identify to species. Another edible puffball, C.cyathiformis (lilac puffball) grows to similar dimensions but has gleba that is purple-brown when mature. Calvatia fragilis is smaller and pink or purple mature gleba. C.bicolor is a smaller, rounder puffball that could be confused with younger specimens of C.craniiformis, but the former species has more coarsely ornamented spores, and lacks a distinct subgleba. Handkea utriformis is roughly similar in appearance to C.craniiformis, but unlike the latter it develops a <b>cavernous</b> opening to reveal an olive-brown gleba, and has distinct slits in its capillitial threads.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries are {{branches of}} the common carotid arteries. They enter the cranium through the carotid canal, travel through the <b>cavernous</b> sinus and enter the subarachnoid space. They then enter the circle of Willis, with two branches, the anterior cerebral arteries emerging. These branches travel forward and then upward along the longitudinal fissure, and supply the front and midline parts of the brain. One or more small anterior communicating arteries join the two anterior cerebral arteries shortly after they emerge as branches. The internal carotid arteries continue forward as the middle cerebral arteries. They travel sideways along the sphenoid bone of the eye socket, then upwards through the insula cortex, where final branches arise. The middle cerebral arteries send branches along their length.|$|E
5|$|Cave Story {{takes place}} within the <b>cavernous</b> {{interior}} of a floating island. The island is populated by Mimigas, a race of sentient, rabbit-like creatures. A particular species of red flower that grows in the island causes the normally peaceful Mimigas to fall into a violent frenzy when ingested. The island also conceals an artifact called the Demon Crown, which has vast magical powers. An army of robot soldiers {{was sent to the}} floating island on a military expedition, seeking to harness the Demon Crown as a weapon for wars on the surface world. These robots slaughtered Mimigas indiscriminately in their search for the crown, but were defeated when the Mimigas decided to eat the red flowers as a last resort. Shortly before the game begins, Professor Booster, the Sakamoto family, and various assistants formed a scientific party to research the island, but they became stranded when their medical doctor managed to acquire the Crown: he then forced the expedition to search for the red flowers.|$|E
5|$|During the 1999 NBA draft, {{believing that}} the Raptors still lacked a strong frontcourt presence, Grunwald traded first-round draft pick Jonathan Bender for power forward Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers. Davis quickly entered the Raptors {{starting}} lineup and he would develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, Bender would only play nine seasons and {{would be out of}} the league by age 29. In the backcourt, Carter, Christie and Dell Curry played at the shooting guard position and Alvin Williams and Muggsy Bogues at point guard. The rotation of Davis, Oakley and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's improvement helped the team make its first ever playoff appearance, fulfilling a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season. Lacking significant post-season experience, Toronto was defeated 3–0 by the New York Knicks in the first round. Nonetheless, team improvements and the rise of Carter—who emphatically won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest—attracted many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, after having played four years at the <b>cavernous</b> SkyDome, which was better suited to baseball and Canadian football. Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45–37 record.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a number of other {{conditions}} including tumors, strokes, head trauma, previous infections of the central nervous system, genetic abnormalities, and as a result of brain damage around the time of birth. Of those with brain tumors, almost 30% have epilepsy, making them the cause of about 4% of cases. The risk is greatest for tumors in the temporal lobe and those that grow slowly. Other mass lesions such as cerebral <b>cavernous</b> malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as 4060%. Of those who have had a stroke, 2–4% develop epilepsy. In the United Kingdom strokes account for 15% of cases and it is believed to be the cause in 30% of the elderly. Between 6 and 20% of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma. Mild brain injury increases the risk about two-fold while severe brain injury increases the risk seven-fold. In those who have experienced a high-powered gunshot wound to the head, the risk is about 50%.|$|E
5|$|From the {{earliest}} times, the Chinese {{were concerned with}} the destructive force of earthquakes. It was recorded in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian of 91BC that in 780BC an earthquake had been powerful enough to divert the courses of three rivers. It was not known {{at the time that}} earthquakes were caused by the shifting of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust; instead, the people of the ancient Zhou Dynasty explained them as disturbances with cosmic yin and yang, along with the heavens' displeasure with acts committed (or the common peoples' grievances ignored) by the current ruling dynasty. These theories were ultimately derived from the ancient text of the Yijing (Book of Changes), in its fifty-first hexagram. There were other early theories about earthquakes, developed by those such as the ancient Greeks. Anaxagoras (c.500–428BC) believed that they were caused by excess water near the surface crust of the earth bursting into the Earth's hollows; Democritus (c. 460–370BC) believed that the saturation of the Earth with water caused them; Anaximenes (c.585–c.525BC) believed they were the result of massive pieces of the Earth falling into the <b>cavernous</b> hollows due to drying; and Aristotle (384–322BC) believed they were caused by instability of vapor (pneuma) caused by the drying of the moist Earth by the Sun's rays.|$|E
5|$|The White House is {{the oldest}} {{building}} on President's Park. An {{integral part of the}} planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the <b>cavernous</b> East Room. With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty East Room. The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended as if she were still carrying laundry into the East Room, accompanied by the smell of soap or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} a degree of cross-fertilization between Canadian and American leagues earlier in the 20th century. A number of CFL–NFL interleague games were held in Canada. As well, eleven neutral-site CFL games have been played on American soil. The {{earliest}} of these dates to 1909, while the bulk occurred between 1951 and 1967. The 1909 game, featuring the Ottawa Rough Riders and Hamilton Tigers, {{was sponsored by the}} New York Herald and played at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx; this in the era when the Canadian game was more similar to rugby football and did not feature modern rules such as the forward pass. The next game, a 1951 match-up between the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts in Buffalo, was billed as the first true all-Canadian game played in the United States and drew more than 18,000, a decent crowd for the era. In 1958, Hamilton defeated Ottawa in a regular-season contest in front about 15,000 in Philadelphia's <b>cavernous</b> Municipal Stadium, 24–18. It remains the only CFL game played outside Canada, involving two Canadian teams, that actually counted in the standings.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cavernous</b> segment {{also gives}} rise to small capsular arteries that supply {{the wall of the}} <b>cavernous</b> sinus.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cavernous</b> segment, or C4, of the {{internal}} carotid artery begins at the petrolingual ligament and extends to the proximal dural ring, which is formed by the medial and inferior periosteum of the anterior clinoid process. The <b>cavernous</b> segment is surrounded by the <b>cavernous</b> sinus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cavernous</b> sinus {{thrombosis}} (CST) is {{the formation}} of a blood clot within the <b>cavernous</b> sinus, a cavity {{at the base of the}} brain which drains deoxygenated blood from the brain back to the heart. The cause is usually from a spreading infection in the nose, sinuses, ears, or teeth. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus are often the associated bacteria. <b>Cavernous</b> sinus thrombosis symptoms include: decrease or loss of vision, chemosis, exophthalmos (bulging eyes), headaches, and paralysis of the cranial nerves which course through the <b>cavernous</b> sinus. This infection is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment, which usually includes antibiotics and sometimes surgical drainage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cavernous</b> sinus {{thrombosis}} is a specialised form of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, {{where there}} is thrombosis of the <b>cavernous</b> sinus of the basal skull dura, due to the retrograde spread of infection and endothelial damage from the danger triangle of the face. The facial veins in this area anastomose with the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins of the orbit, which drain directly posteriorly into the <b>cavernous</b> sinus through the superior orbital fissure. Staphyloccoal or Streptococcal infections of the face, for example nasal or upper lip pustules may thus spread directly into the <b>cavernous</b> sinus, causing stroke-like symptoms of double vision, squint, as well as spread of infection to cause meningitis.|$|E
25|$|A MRI using flow {{parameters}} and an MR venogram {{are more sensitive}} than a CT scan, and are the imaging studies of choice to diagnose <b>cavernous</b> sinus thrombosis. Findings may include deformity of the internal carotid artery within the <b>cavernous</b> sinus, and an obvious signal hyperintensity within thrombosed vascular sinuses on all pulse sequences.|$|E

25|$|The light-filled {{interior}} {{designed by}} Latrobe was striking {{in contrast to}} the dark, <b>cavernous</b> recesses of traditional Gothic cathedrals.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral {{angiography}} can be performed, {{but it is}} invasive and {{not very}} sensitive. Orbital venography is difficult to perform, but it is excellent in diagnosing occlusion of the <b>cavernous</b> sinus.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} petrosal sinus is a venous structure located {{beneath the}} brain. It receives {{blood from the}} <b>cavernous</b> sinus and passes backward and laterally to drain into the transverse sinus.|$|E
25|$|Recognizing {{the primary}} source of {{infection}} (i.e., facial cellulitis, middle ear, and sinus infections) and treating {{the primary source}} expeditiously {{is the best way to}} prevent <b>cavernous</b> sinus thrombosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} signs of CST {{are related to}} {{anatomical}} structures affected within the <b>cavernous</b> sinus, notably cranial nerves III-VI, as well as symptoms resulting from impaired venous drainage from the orbit and eye.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>cavernous</b> sinus thrombosis is made clinically, with imaging studies {{to confirm the}} clinical impression. Proptosis, ptosis, chemosis, and cranial nerve palsy beginning in one eye and progressing to the other eye establish the diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{is owned by}} Amtrak and houses many Amtrak corporate offices, although Amtrak is officially headquartered at Union Station in Washington, D.C. The 562,000ft² (52,000 m²) facility features a <b>cavernous</b> main passenger concourse with ornate Art Deco decor.|$|E
25|$|Dental caries {{can also}} cause bad breath and foul tastes. In highly progressed cases, an {{infection}} can spread from the tooth to the surrounding soft tissues. Complications such as <b>cavernous</b> sinus thrombosis and Ludwig angina can be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Staphylococcus aureus is {{the most}} common {{infectious}} microbe, found in 70% of the cases. Streptococcus is the second leading cause. Gram-negative rods and anaerobes may also lead to <b>cavernous</b> sinus thrombosis. Rarely, Aspergillus fumigatus and mucormycosis cause CST.|$|E
