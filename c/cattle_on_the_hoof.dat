5000|$|Boys {{and girls}} aged six and over joined Shaka's force as {{apprentice}} warriors (udibi) {{and served as}} carriers of rations, supplies like cooking pots and sleeping mats, and extra weapons until they joined the main ranks. It is sometimes held that such support was used more for very light forces designed to extract tribute in cattle and slaves from neighbouring groups. Nevertheless, the concept of [...] "light" [...] forces is questionable. The fast-moving Zulu raiding party, or [...] "ibutho lempi," [...] on a mission invariably traveled light, driving <b>cattle</b> as provisions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof,</b> and were not weighed down with heavy weapons and supply packs. The herdboy logistic structure was deployed in support of these relatively short-term operations, and was easily adaptable to large or small expeditions.|$|R

5000|$|BUREAU SYSTEM. Bureau {{chiefs and}} heads of staff {{departments}} were responsible forvarious {{aspects of the}} Army's administration and logistics and reported directly to theSecretary of War. The division of responsibility and authority over them among theSecretary of War, the Assistant Secretaries, and the General in Chief was never spelled out,and the supply departments functioned independently and without effective coordinationthroughout most of the Civil War, although much improved after Grant took command.Logistical support was entrusted to the heads of four supply departments inWashington: the Quartermaster General, responsible for clothing and equipment, forage,animals, transportation, and housing; the Commissary General for rations; the Chief ofOrdnance for weapons, ammunition, and miscellaneous related equipment; and the SurgeonGeneral for medical supplies, evacuation, treatment, and hospitalization of the wounded.For other support there were the Adjutant General, the Inspector General, thePaymaster General, the Judge Advocate General, the Chief of Engineers, and the Chief ofTopographical Engineers.The military department was the basic organizational unit for administrative andlogistical purposes, and the commander of each department controlled the support in that areawith no intervening level between his departmental headquarters and the bureau chiefs inWashington. There were six departments when the war started (East, West, Texas, NewMexico, Utah, and Pacific); however, later on, boundaries changed and several geographicaldepartments might be grouped together as a military [...] "division" [...] headquarters.Army depots were located in major cities: Boston, New York, Baltimore,Washington, Cincinnati, Louisville, St. Louis, Chicago, New Orleans, and San Francisco.Philadelphia was the chief depot and manufacturing center for clothing. Advanced andtemporary supply bases were established as needed to support active operations. Until 1864most depots were authorized the rank of captain as commander, who despite their low rankand meager pay, had tremendous resources of men, money, and material under their control.There were a few exceptions, notably COL Daniel H. Rucker at the Washington QM Depotand COL George D. Ramsay at the Washington Arsenal. The primary function of the depotswas to procure supplies and prepare them {{for use in the}} field by repacking, assembling, orother similar tasks.Procurement was decentralized. Purchases were made on the market by low-bidcontract in the major cities and producing areas by depot officers. Flour and some othercommodities were procured closer to the troops when possible. Cattle were contracted for atspecific points, and major beef depots were maintained at Washington (on the grounds of theunfinished Washington Monument), Alexandria, VA, and Louisville, KY. TheSubsistence Department developed a highly effective system of moving <b>cattle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof</b> tothe immediate rear of the armies in the field, to be slaughtered by brigade butchers andissued to the troops the day before consumption.The Confederate Army used a similar system with depots at Richmond, Staunton,Raleigh, Atlanta, Columbus (GA), Huntsville, Montgomery, Jackson (MS), Little Rock,Alexandria (LA), and San Antonio.|$|E
30|$|Typically, mankind {{has tended}} to be more {{interested}} in salted pig products (bacon, sausage, ham) than in salted beef products. For that reason, in the middle nineteenth century, pigs were slaughtered in Chicago before their movement east, while cows were shipped live. One great transport innovation in nineteenth century Chicago was the four-season refrigerated rail car, used by Gustavus Swift. (His engineer’s brilliant insight was to put the ice on top of the meat so it dripped down.) After Swift began using refrigerated cars, Chicago increasingly shipped prepared beef, instead of <b>cattle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hoof,</b> as well as prepared pigs.|$|E
