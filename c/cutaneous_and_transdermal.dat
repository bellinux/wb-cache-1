40|$|Microemulsions are {{fluid and}} {{isotropic}} formulations {{that have been}} widely studied as delivery systems {{for a variety of}} routes, including the skin. In spite of what the name suggests, microemulsions are nanocarriers, and their use as topical delivery systems derives from their multiple advantages compared to other dermatological formulations, such as ease of preparation, thermodynamic stability and penetration-enhancing properties. Composition, charge and internal structure have been reported as determinant factors for the modulation of drug release and <b>cutaneous</b> <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> transport. This manuscript aims at reviewing how these and other characteristics affect delivery and make microemulsions appealing for topical and transdermal administration, as well as how they can be modulated during the formulation design to improve the potential and efficacy of the final system...|$|E
40|$|The skin is a {{remarkable}} barrier, protecting us from invasion of e. g. harmful microorganisms and UV-radiation. However, the skin is not adopted to resist repeated exposure to the multitude of xenobiotics introduced into modern society. Some of these chemicals are skin sensitizers, and exposure {{can lead to the}} development of contact allergy. Contact allergy has significant social and economic consequences, both for the individual and for society. It is therefore important to prevent sensitization. The skin also constitutes a potential route for administration of drugs, and much effort is put into the development of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> drug delivery systems. The work of this thesis aims to improve the understanding of processes related to the interactions between the skin and topically applied compounds, i. e. drugs and skin sensitizers. Specifically, two-photon microscopy has been used to study the cutaneous absorption and distribution of model drugs and a series of model skin sensitizers. Improved cutaneous absorption was demonstrated using formulations composed of lipid cubic phases. The work also showed elevated sensitization potency of haptens depending on delivery vehicles. Putative mechanistic explanations for the observed effects have been proposed. Specifically, phthalates were shown to increase the sensitization potency of isothiocyanates. The phthalate-induced effect could be linked to a PSU-targeted delivery of the haptens into the skin. It could also be shown that vehicles alter hapten reactivity to stratum corneum proteins leading to variations in sensitization potency. Moreover, hapten protein targets in skin have been identified using caged fluorescent model hapten. Specifically, basal cell keratinocytes and the keratins were identified as specific hapten targets in the skin. In conclusion, the work presented in this thesis contributes to the general understanding of the mechanisms involved in the cutaneous absorption of topically applied drugs and skin sensitizers. It also demonstrates the capabilities of using TPM when investigating the interactions between the skin and xenobiotics...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that the vehicle in which a permeant {{is applied to the}} skin has a distinctive effect on the dermal <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> delivery of active ingredients. The <b>cutaneous</b> <b>and</b> percutaneous absorptions can be enhanced, e. g. by an increase in thermodynamic activity, supersaturation and penetration modifiers. Furthermore, dermal <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> delivery can be influenced by the interactions that may occur between the vehicle and the skin on the one hand, and interactions between the active ingredient and the skin on the other hand. Emulsions are widely used as cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations because of their excellent solubilizing capacities for lipophilic and hydrophilic active ingredients and application acceptability. This review focuses, in particular, on the effect of emulsions on the dermal <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> delivery of active ingredients. It is shown that the type of emulsion (w/o vs. o/w emulsion), the droplet size, the emollient, the emulsifier as well as the surfactant organization (micelles, lyotropic liquid crystals) in the emulsion may affect the <b>cutaneous</b> <b>and</b> percutaneous absorption. Examples substantiate the fact that emulsion constituents such as emollients and emulsifiers should be selected carefully for optimal efficiency of the formulation. Moreover, to understand the influence of emulsion on dermal <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> delivery, the physicochemical properties of the formulation after application are considered...|$|R

40|$|This review {{provides}} an overall discussion of microencapsulation systems for both oral <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> drug deliveries. Clinically, many drugs, especially proteins and peptides, {{are susceptible to}} the gastrointestinal tract and the first-pass metabolism after oral administration while some drugs exhibit low skin permeability through transdermal delivery route. Medicated microcapsules as oral <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> drug delivery vehicles are believed to offer an extended drug effect at a relatively low dose and provide a better patient compliance. The polymeric microcapsules can be produced by different microencapsulation methods and the drug microencapsulation technology provides the quality preservation for drug stabilization. The release of the entrapped drug is controlled and prolonged for specific usages. Some recent {{studies have focused on}} the evaluation of drug containing microcapsules on potential biological and therapeutic applications. For the oral delivery, in vivo animal models were used for evaluating possible treatment effects of drug containing microcapsules. For the transdermal drug delivery, skin delivery models were introduced to investigate the potential skin delivery of medicated microcapsules. Finally, the challenges and limitations of drug microencapsulation in real life are discussed and the commercially available drug formulations using microencapsulation technology for oral <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> applications are shown...|$|R

40|$|THESIS 8279 The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the potential application of halloysite, an aluminosilicate clay material, for use in topical <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> drug delivery.

40|$|Cutaneous leiomyomas, rare benign tumors {{originating}} from the arrector pili muscle {{of the hair}} follicle, {{can be associated with}} the common uterine fibroids in a syndrome called multiple <b>cutaneous</b> <b>and</b> uterine leiomyomas. Multiple <b>cutaneous</b> <b>and</b> uterine leiomyomas are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, providing an excellent opportunity {{for the study of the}} common non-Mendelian manifestation of isolated uterine fibroids. This study reports the clinical and molecular characterization of an extended family with multiple <b>cutaneous</b> <b>and</b> uterine leiomyomas. Linkage analysis has shown that the disease in this family is linked to the recently reported genetic locus for multiple <b>cutaneous</b> <b>and</b> uterine leiomyomas, with a maximum two-point LOD score of 4. 453 for markers D 1 S 2670, D 1 S 2785, D 1 S 547, and D 1 S 1609. The identification of key recombination events has allowed us to refine substantially the location of the genetic locus for multiple <b>cutaneous</b> <b>and</b> uterine leiomyomas, from 14 [*]cM to an interval of 4. 55 or 7. 19 [*]cM, depending on the final phenotype of a young family member in which one of the key recombination events has occurred.

The refinement of the genetic locus for multiple <b>cutaneous</b> <b>and</b> uterine leiomyomas and the availability of an extended multigeneration pedigree will facilitate the identification of the mutated gene responsible for multiple <b>cutaneous</b> <b>and</b> uterine leiomyomas, which, in turn, may provide key information for the understanding of the molecular basis of the common uterine fibroids...|$|R

40|$|Although {{sildenafil}} citrate (SC) is used extensively for erectile dysfunction, oral delivery of SC encounters many obstacles. Furthermore, the physicochemical characteristics of this amphoteric drug are challenging for delivery system formulation <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> permeation. This article concerns {{the assessment of}} the potential of nanomedicine for improving SC delivery <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> permeation. SC-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were fabricated using a modified high-shear homogenization technique. Nanoparticle optimization steps included particle size analysis, entrapment efficiency (EE) determination, freeze-drying and reconstitution, differential scanning calorimetry, in vitro release, stability study and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Transdermal permeation of the nanocarriers compared with SC suspension across human skin was assessed using a modified Franz diffusion cell assembly. Results revealed that SLNs and NLCs could be optimized in the nanometric range (180 and 100 nm, respectively) with excellent EE (96. 7 % and 97. 5 %, respectively). Nanoparticles have significantly enhanced in vitro release <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> permeation of SC compared with its suspensions. Furthermore, transdermal permeation of SC exhibited higher initial release from both SLN and NLC formulations followed by controlled release, with promising implications for faster onset and longer drug duration. Nanomedicines prepared exhibited excellent physical stability for the study period. Solid nanoparticles optimized in this study successfully improved SC characteristics, paving the way for an efficient topical ViagraÂ® product...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} and document the potential of applying ceramics in two specific drug delivery applications: tamper-resistant opioid formulations <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> enhancement protrusions. Geopolymers were developed into the matrix for a tamper-resistant formulation, aiming to protect drug substances from non-medical abuse. The synthesis conditions and excipients composition of the geopolymer-based formulation were modified in this work to facilitate a stable and extended drug delivery. Results showed that 37 ÂºC 100 % humidity for 48 hours were applicable conditions to obtain geopolymer with suitable mechanical strength and porosity. Moreover, {{it was found that}} the integration of poly(methyl acrylate) into the geopolymer-based formulation could reduce the drug release at low pH and, meanwhile, maintain the mechanical strength. Therefore, the geopolymer-based drug formulations concluded from these studies were applied in oral <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> delivery systems. Evidence of the tamper-resistance of geopolymer-based oral <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> formulations was documented and compared to the corresponding commercial opioid formulations. The results provided experimental support for the positive effects of geopolymers as drug carriers for the tamper-resistance of oral <b>and</b> <b>transdermal</b> delivery systems. Self-setting bioceramics, calcium phosphate and calcium sulfate were fabricated into transdermal enhancement protrusions in this work for the first time. Results showed that, under mild conditions, both bioceramics could form pyramid-shaped needles in the micron size. The drug release from these needles could be controlled by the bulk surface area, porosity and degradation of the bioceramics. An in vitro insertion test showed that the bioceramic microneedles had enough mechanical strength to insert into skin. Further optimization on the geometry of needles and the substrate material was also performed. The higher aspect-ratio needles with a flexible and self-swellable substrate could release most of the drug content within 4 hours and could penetrate through the stratum corneum by manual insertion. This study explored the potential application of bioceramics in <b>transdermal</b> enhancement protrusions <b>and</b> showed promising indication of their future developments...|$|R
