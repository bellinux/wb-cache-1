During this time, Allied forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions to withstand the several Japanese drives to retake the islands.|$|E

Over 1,000 signatures were collected on that one day alone, in a petition to be submitted to Chief Executive Donald Tsang and other senior officials. In addition, a group of protesters began a peaceful sit-in that day.

5|$|On 3 April the Joint Chiefs persuaded McNamara and Johnson {{to launch}} a four-week attack on North Vietnam's lines of communications, which would isolate that nation from its {{overland}} sources of supply in the PRC and the Soviet Union. About one-third of the North's imports came down the northeast railroad from the PRC, while the remaining two-thirds <b>came</b> <b>by</b> sea through Haiphong and other ports. For {{the first time in}} the campaign, targets were to be chosen for their military, rather than their psychological, significance. During the four weeks, 26 bridges and seven ferries were destroyed. Other targets included the extensive North Vietnamese radar system, barracks, and ammunition depots.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers felt {{part of the}} failings laid {{with the}} {{underdeveloped}} characters despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters. The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations, making them hard to identify with.

DVD Talk {{found it hard to}} piece together the relationship between the main characters, but acknowledged the later half addressed some of these issues by revealing the background of some characters. They felt the revelations fleshed out Otoha's personality and motivation, helping viewers to sympathize and identify with the protagonist.|$|E

After talking for a short while, and another flight attendant <b>came</b> <b>by,</b> he was let into the cockpit. No information about the hijacking was given to the passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, the passengers were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E
5|$|Events at Ulm {{were now}} {{reaching}} a conclusion. On 15 October Ney's troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments {{and on the}} 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself. Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack {{began to realize that}} there was little hope of rescue. On 17 October Napoleon's emissary, Ségur, signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid <b>came</b> <b>by</b> that date. Gradually, however, Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and Neresheim and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October. Fifteen hundred troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape, {{but the vast majority of}} the Austrian force marched out on 21 October and laid down their arms without incident, all with the Grande Armée drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation (see infobox picture). The officers were permitted to leave, pending their signatures on a parole in which they agreed not to take up arms against France until they were exchanged. More than ten general officers were included in this agreement, including Mack, Johann von Klenau, Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, Prince Liechtenstein, and Ignaz Gyulai.|$|E

5|$|In {{making his}} {{terrestrial}} globes, Molyneux examined ruttiers (instructions for directions at sea) and pilots (navigational handbooks). He {{is known to}} have given a ruttier for Brazil and the West Indies to Thomas Harriot in 1590. He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians. It is likely, for instance, that Sir Walter Raleigh advised him on a legend in Spanish about the Solomon Islands that appeared on the terrestrial globe. Raleigh <b>came</b> <b>by</b> the information from Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, a Galician explorer sent by King Philip II of Spain to fortify the Strait of Magellan after Francis Drake had passed through it. In 1584, the Spaniard was Raleigh's guest in London for a few weeks, after being captured by Raleigh on a journey to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova and Agnieszka Radwańska {{have played}} each other {{eighteen}} times since 2007, with Kuznetsova leading the head-to-head 14–4. Their first meeting was at Wimbledon in 2007 with Kuznetsova winning in straight sets. Kuznetsova won their first three meetings, {{but in the}} four meetings that eventuated in 2008, Kuznetsova lost three of them, including {{in the third round}} of the Australian Open and in the fourth round of Wimbledon. Additionally, she also lost against her at the year-end championships later in the year, after Radwańska replaced an injured Ana Ivanovic. Kuznetsova subsequently dominated Radwańska in future meetings, winning six meetings between the pair between 2009 and 2012, including an upset victory at the 2012 French Open, until Radwańska stopped the rot at the 2014 Mutua Madrid Open, saving a match point in the process. Prior to 2014, Kuznetsova's two most recent titles <b>came</b> <b>by</b> defeating Radwańska in the championship match, first at Beijing in 2009 and then at San Diego in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses <b>came</b> <b>by</b> to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E

5|$|On 11 May, Plagis {{attempted}} to down an Italian Reggiane Re.2001 by flying straight at it to ram it; taking erratic evasive manoeuvres, the Italian aircraft stalled and almost {{crashed into the}} sea. Thinking he had downed the enemy, Plagis claimed afterwards to have achieved an aerial victory without firing a shot, but the Italian flight reported no losses. Plagis's Spitfire was lightly hit during this engagement, and the Rhodesian had some luck returning safely; he landed with only three gallons (14 litres) of fuel left. On 16 May, Plagis and an English ace, Pilot Officer Peter Nash, destroyed a Bf 109 for a shared kill that became No. 249 Squadron's 100th victory over Malta. Amid the continuing siege, {{the need for a}} major supply convoy to Malta was becoming urgent; the Governor Lord Gort warned Britain in early June that if no supplies <b>came</b> <b>by</b> August, he would have to surrender to prevent a famine.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} Dover, Pistrucci had {{difficulty}} with Customs, possibly caused by Bonelli's malice. Once {{he was able}} to, he journeyed to London. He had letters of introduction to several people, and Charles Konig, Keeper of Minerals at the British Museum, proved a loyal friend. Through Konig, Pistrucci met the famous naturalist, Sir Joseph Banks, who commissioned the artist to do a portrait of him. While Banks was sitting for Pistrucci, the connoisseur Richard Payne Knight <b>came</b> <b>by,</b> anxious to show Sir Joseph a cameo fragment he had purchased, and which he dated to Ancient Greece. After Banks praised it highly, Pistrucci, on examining it, identified it as his own work, displaying the secret mark he had placed on it. The incident increased Pistrucci's reputation in London.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Hitler {{had come}} into power, he had started to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933 he {{contracted}} Paul Troost to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost. As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and <b>came</b> <b>by</b> every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor {{on the progress of}} the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement. Hitler evinced considerable interest in Speer during the luncheon, and later told Speer that he had been looking for a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany. Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.|$|E

5|$|Some of the city's necessities such as coal {{arrived by}} barge, but most <b>came</b> <b>by</b> road. Carts, carriages, horses and {{pedestrians}} were crowded {{together and the}} gateways in the wall formed bottlenecks through which {{it was difficult to}} progress. The nineteen-arch London Bridge was even more congested. The better-off used hackney carriages and sedan chairs to get to their destinations without getting filthy. The poor walked, and might be splashed by the wheeled vehicles and drenched by slops being thrown out and water falling from the overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the choking black smoke belching forth from factories which made soap, from breweries and iron smelters and from about 15,000 houses burning coal.|$|E
5|$|The first {{change to}} the routing of NY10 <b>came</b> <b>by</b> 1926 when NY10 was {{extended}} northeastward over modern NY3 to Plattsburgh, where it terminated at NY30 (now NY22). The route was truncated one year later when US9W {{was assigned to the}} portion of NY10 between New Jersey and Albany. NY10 was subsequently truncated to the former western terminus of its overlap with NY5 in Schenectady. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY10 was significantly reconfigured to begin in Deposit and end at the Canadian border north of Malone. The only segment of NY10 not altered by the realignment, which utilized a combination of previously numbered routes and unsigned roadways, was the piece between Long Lake and Lake Clear Junction.|$|E
