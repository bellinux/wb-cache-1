50|$|Islam {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the island nation by a British Ahmadi Muslim of Pakistani descent, Iftikhar A. Ayaz, who works as the British <b>consular</b> <b>representative</b> to Tuvalu Islands. In 1985, he came to Tuvalu, and in out of office hours, he endeavoured to introduce the Islamic faith to the local population. With several converts to the faith, Ayaz requested {{the headquarters of the}} Community in London to send a missionary to the Islands. As a result, Hafiz Jibrail, a Ghanaian missionary, who was already based in the South Pacific at the time, arrived in 1989, approximately four years after the introduction of Islam to the nation. However, in 1991 Hafiz Jibrail had to be transferred to the Kiribati Islands and thus was replaced by Abdul Ghaffar, another Ghanaian missionary to the Community. Nonetheless, having served the Islands for roughly 5 years, he returned to serve his home country, Ghana. After a lag of several years, during which the islands had no missionary, Abdul Hakeem Boateng, another Ghanaian missionary arrived in 2003, who served there until 2009. Since 2009, Muhammad Idris, an Indonesian missionary to the Ahmadiyya Community, is now the current and first non-Ghanaian missionary to Tuvalu.|$|E
