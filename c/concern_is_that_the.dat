5|$|The {{drilling}} {{project has}} been opposed by some environmental groups and scientists who have argued that hot-water drilling would have a more limited environmental impact. The main <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the bore hole from refreezing. Scientists of the United States National Research Council have taken the position {{that it should be}} assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that after such a long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.|$|E
25|$|Most Sunni Muslims {{believe that}} visual depictions {{of all the}} prophets of Islam should be {{prohibited}} and are particularly averse to visual representations of Muhammad. The key <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> use of images can encourage idolatry. In Shia Islam, however, images of Muhammad are quite common nowadays, even though Shia scholars historically were against such depictions. Still, many Muslims who take a stricter view of the supplemental traditions will sometimes challenge any depiction of Muhammad, including those created and published by non-Muslims.|$|E
25|$|A {{technical}} <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 14 MeV neutrons {{produced by}} the fusion reactions will damage the materials from which the reactor is built. Research is in progress to determine whether and how reactor walls can be designed to last {{long enough to make}} a commercial power station economically viable {{in the presence of the}} intense neutron bombardment. The damage is primarily caused by high energy neutrons knocking atoms out of their normal position in the crystal lattice. A related problem for a future commercial fusion power station is that the neutron bombardment will induce radioactivity in the reactor material itself. Maintaining and decommissioning a commercial reactor may thus be difficult and expensive. Another problem is that superconducting magnets are damaged by neutron fluxes. A new special research facility, IFMIF, is planned to investigate this problem.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{construction}} of hair jewelry in the home was a lack of trust in commercial manufacturers. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hair used in the jewelry would not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> hair <b>that</b> had <b>been</b> given to the jeweler, having been substituted with other hair.|$|R
50|$|Around May 2006, <b>the</b> UNPFII {{recommended}} <b>that</b> National Geographic {{and other}} sponsors suspend <b>the</b> project. <b>Concerns</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> knowledge {{gleaned from the}} research could clash with long-held beliefs of indigenous peoples and threaten their cultures. There <b>were</b> also <b>concerns</b> <b>that</b> indigenous claims to land rights and other resources could be threatened.|$|R
50|$|His general <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Versailles conference {{should set}} the {{conditions}} for economic recovery. However, the conference focused on borders and national security. Reparations were set {{at a level that}} Keynes perceived would ruin Europe, Woodrow Wilson refused to countenance forgiveness of war debts and US Treasury officials would not even discuss the credit program.|$|R
25|$|According to the USGS, {{there is}} a broad {{consensus}} {{that the possibility of}} major earthquakes in the New Madrid Seismic Zone remains a concern, and that the GPS data do not provide a compelling case for lessening perceived earthquake hazards in the region. One <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> small earthquakes that still happen are not diminishing over time, as would be if they were aftershocks of the 1811–1812 events; another is that the 4,500-year archaeological record of large earthquakes in the region is more significant than ten years of direct strain measurement. The USGS issued a fact sheet in 2009 stating the estimate of a 7–10% chance of a New Madrid earthquake of magnitude comparable to one of the 1811–1812 quakes within the next 50 years, and a 25–40% chance of a magnitude 6.0 earthquake in the same time frame.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Nolan is a vocal proponent for the {{continued}} use of film stock over digital recording and projection formats, summing up his beliefs as, [...] "I am not committed to film out of nostalgia. I am in favor {{of any kind of}} technical innovation but it needs to exceed what has gone before and so far nothing has exceeded anything that's come before". Nolan's major <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> film industry's adoption of digital formats has been driven purely by economic factors as opposed to digital being a superior medium to film, saying: [...] "I think, truthfully, it boils down to the economic interest of manufacturers and [...] industry that makes more money through change rather than through maintaining the status quo." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{concerns}} {{have been raised}} among intersex activists that LGBT or queer groups including them could give the wrong impression that all or most intersex people are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> addition is only cosmetic, and that among groups that do this, LGBT goals are always prioritized over intersex ones. Emi Koyama states: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Concern</b> has <b>been</b> {{expressed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{program does}} not provide any latitude for whistle-blowers. Senator Chuck Grassley <b>is</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> program <b>is</b> merely a way {{to crack down on}} whistle-blowers.|$|R
50|$|His <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{tendency}} to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem, {{which is in}} the southern Kingdom of Judah, would lead to a return to King Rehoboam. He makes two golden calves and places them in Bethel and Dan. He erects the two calves in what he figures (in some interpretations) as substitutes for the cherubim built by King Solomon in Jerusalem.|$|R
50|$|Action for Botton's main <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> move to paid {{employment}} would prevent co-workers from continuing {{to share their}} homes with learning disabled people {{in the way they}} had since Botton was established. During the mediation process, the Trust reaffirmed its commitment to shared living and co-working, within a mixed portfolio of living and care options available to the people it supports.|$|R
2500|$|One <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> child {{mortality}} rate has not decreased {{in some areas}} as rapidly as had been planned, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where in 2013 [...] "the region still has the highest {{child mortality}} rate: 92 deaths per 1000 live births". and that [...] "Globally, nearly half of under-five deaths are attributable to undernutrition." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Dr. Swire, other UK {{relatives}} of the victims, {{and a range of}} legal campaigners, including Professor Black, say that the May 2000 trial of two Libyan suspects, the other of whom was not convicted, amounts to a cover up and a serious miscarriage of justice. Their <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> truth has not come out, and that the guilty have not been brought to justice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Few mathematicians are {{typically}} concerned on a daily, working basis over logicism, formalism {{or any other}} philosophical position. Instead, their primary <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mathematical enterprise as a whole always remains productive. Typically, they see this as insured by remaining open-minded, practical and busy; as potentially threatened by becoming overly-ideological, fanatically reductionistic or lazy. Such a view was expressed by the Physics Nobel Prize laureate Richard Feynman: ...|$|E
500|$|Oppenheimer raised no {{objection}} to the sequence in the film in which he informed Brigadier General Thomas Farrell <b>that</b> <b>the</b> odds of a runaway explosion destroying the planet were less than one in a million, although he told MGM that he never said this. The cultured Oppenheimer's main <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> script <b>was</b> poor, with characters <b>that</b> <b>were</b> [...] "stilted, lifeless, and without purpose or insight." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ho Chi Minh began {{negotiations}} in Hanoi with French Commissioner for Tonkin, Jean Sainteny. [...] Ho's <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 150,000 Chinese troops in northern Vietnam {{would not go}} home and <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> aiding <b>the</b> Viet Minh's rival nationalist groups, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party and the Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam. Ho had decided to seek cooperation with the French even thought that might delay Vietnam attaining independence from France.|$|R
40|$|We present {{preliminary}} {{results of an}} investigation into the suitability of virtualised hardware – in particular clouds – for running computational experiments. Our main <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reported CPU time would not be reliable and reproducible. <b>The</b> results demonstrate <b>that</b> while this <b>is</b> true in cases where many virtual machines are running on the same physical hardware, there is no inherent variation introduced by using virtualised hardware compared to non-virtualised hardware...|$|R
2500|$|Justice Powell concurs in the {{judgment}} {{in a similar manner}} to Justice Stewart. [...] Powell's primary <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> near-application of strict scrutiny {{and the use of the}} equal protection clause is too strong and interferes with the legitimate regulation of the State on marriage. [...] Similar to Justice Stewart, Powell would use the due process clause, but invoke it in a way that would be flexible enough to allow the State to pass reasonable regulations (regulations that probably would not be upheld under Marshall's standard).|$|E
2500|$|Of all the {{questions}} on the scale, Sell considered those assessing sexual attraction {{to be the most}} important as sexual attraction is a better reflection of the concept of sexual orientation which he defined as [...] "extent of sexual attractions toward members of the other, same, both sexes or neither" [...] than either sexual identity or sexual behavior. Identity and behavior are measured as supplemental information because they are both closely tied to sexual attraction and sexual orientation. Major criticisms of the SASO have not been established, but a <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reliability and validity remains largely unexamined.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{widespread}} agreement that p-values are often misused and misinterpreted. One practice {{that has been}} particularly criticized is accepting the alternative hypothesis for any p-value nominally less than [...]05 without other supporting evidence. Although p-values are helpful in assessing how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model, contextual factors must also be considered, such as [...] "the design of a study, {{the quality of the}} measurements, the external evidence for the phenomenon under study, and the validity of assumptions that underlie the data analysis". Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> p-value is often misunderstood as being the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Some statisticians have proposed replacing p-values with alternative measures of evidence, such as confidence intervals, likelihood ratios, or Bayes factors, but there is heated debate on the feasibility of these alternatives. Others have suggested to remove fixed significance thresholds and to interpret p-values as continuous indices of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.|$|E

50|$|During docking, cosmonauts aboard Mir noticed <b>that</b> {{three of}} <b>the</b> eight thermal {{blankets}} (layers of foil vacuum-shield insulation) on the descent module of the approaching Soyuz-TM 9 spacecraft had come loose from their attachments near the heat shield, yet remained attached at their top ends. <b>The</b> main <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> capsule might cool down, permitting condensation to form inside and short out its electrical systems. There <b>was</b> also fear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> blankets might block the infrared vertical sensor, which oriented the module for reentry.|$|R
25|$|NIS took in March 1990 {{initiative}} to centralize the local ship registers and jointly locate them with NIS. They emphasized that NIS operated an around-the-clock duty service. A joint {{location of the}} registers would allow for economies of scale, cutting costs. It would also allow time to be freed up at the magistrate offices and at the district courts. Another <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> recent rationalization program following the introduction of electronic registers had given little savings due to the decentralized nature of the operations.|$|R

25|$|Lord Palmerston {{replied to}} the {{question}} of the Russian ambassador about the reaction of England to a Russian intervention in Hungary, saying: Finish them quickly!, demanding that after they fulfilled their task to return in Russia immediately. Although England worried about a Russian intervention in Hungary, its first <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Russian Empire to not advance in the Balkans, and an important condition for this was a strong Habsburg Empire. So, an independent Hungary could have been an impediment for England's world domination policy.|$|R

50|$|<b>Concerns</b> <b>were</b> {{raised about}} the use by {{the company and its}} {{contractors}} of low doses of antibiotics to promote the pigs' growth, in addition to using antibiotics as part of a treatment regime. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> antibiotics <b>were</b> harmful to the animals and were contributing to the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Smithfield said in 2005 that it would administer antibiotics only to animals who were sick themselves, or who were in close proximity to sick animals; however, in Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations all pigs are in close proximity to each other.|$|R
50|$|Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{rules are}} disproportionately strict in {{comparison}} to the actual risk associated {{with a wide variety of}} eHealth systems and this may prevent companies from initiating the development of new products.|$|E
50|$|Several {{problems}} {{accompanied the}} opening of the connection. One <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> three closed Boonton Line stations no longer have rail service; the stations and trackage have since fallen into disrepair as the alignment has been reclaimed by nature.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{adoption}} of Web 2.0 technologies can allow users to spread hate speech and cyberbullying {{in the library}} system. It is suggested that librarians define hate speech in their user content policies and identify it when it occurs.|$|E

25|$|Civic {{watchdog}} group Poder Ciudadano ('Citizen Power') expressed {{concern over the}} Buenos Aires Public Contracts Law passed November 2013 by the Buenos Aires City Legislature and urged <b>that</b> it <b>be</b> vetoed by Mayor Mauricio Macri, who promoted and signed <b>the</b> bill. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> laws, dealing with municipal government contracts, would reduce transparency and eliminate control mechanisms, thus promoting corruption. Poder Ciudadano similarly denounced the municipal waste management bidding process and service (20% of the city's budget) for its lack of oversight in a 2013 report.|$|R
2500|$|Other <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{project will}} {{threaten}} the livelihood {{of tens of}} thousands of fishermen, destroy the key salmon fishing area off the island by dumping one million tons of dredging spoil waste into the sea, and imply a long-time threat of a large oil spill in the Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan. [...] Dredging of Aniva Bay was completed in 2005. In 2005 the salmon harvest was recorded as an all-time high of more than 134,000tonnes. In 2007 this record was overturned with a salmon catch of 144,181tonnes.|$|R
