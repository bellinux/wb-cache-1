5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of the money has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying or losing the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom money. A minority opinion is that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> expected to spend or fence currency as hot as the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote {{to him that}} if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> gone as Morisi described.|$|E
25|$|That {{same year}} BBC TV started its Pot Black series. A single-frame format <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> been more {{removed from the}} epic finals of the 1940s, and Davis was quick to admit he was a slow starter in matches. Nevertheless, he would be runner-up in the 1971 series (to John Spencer) and {{achieved}} the highest break in the 1970, 1971 and 1975 series.|$|E

25|$|His lack of {{consistency}} {{meant that he}} did not play in the triangular tournament in Australia, which also included West Indies, until the final match. He <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> had a more testing experience, as a fine Zimbabwe batting performance after Australia scored over 300 meant that he came in at number seven needing to score 15 in the final over, bowled by Glenn McGrath, to win the match.|$|E

Schubert himself <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> handled those instruments more deftly, written for them more lovingly.... We place the songs and choruses in The Yeomen of the Guard before all his previous efforts of this particular kind. Thus the music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage.

25|$|The {{contrast}} between Mao's top field commanders <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> been more sharp, {{but on the}} Long March they worked well together, Lin specializing in feints, masked strategy, surprises, ambushes, flank attacks, pounces from the rear, and stratagems. Peng met the enemy head-on in frontal assaults and fought with such fury that again and again he wiped them out. Peng did not believe a battle well fought unless he managed to replenish—and more than replenish—any losses by seizure of enemy guns and converting prisoners of war to new and loyal recruits to the Red Army.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} events which {{led up to}} the peaceful dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> been attained but for the tact and patience of the king himself. He was dethroned on 7 June 1905 by the Storting and renounced the Norwegian throne on 26 October. He declined, indeed, to permit any prince of his house to become king of Norway, but better {{relations between the two countries}} were restored before his death. Oscar II died in Stockholm on 8 December 1907 at 9:10 am.|$|E
25|$|Brunelleschi's {{first major}} {{architectural}} commission {{was for the}} enormous brick dome which covers the central space of Florence's cathedral, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio in the 14th century but left unroofed. While often described as the first building of the Renaissance, Brunelleschi's daring design utilizes the pointed Gothic arch and Gothic ribs that were apparently planned by Arnolfio. It seems certain, however, that while stylistically Gothic, {{in keeping with the}} building it surmounts, the dome is in fact structurally influenced by the great dome of Ancient Rome, which Brunelleschi <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> ignored in seeking a solution. This is the dome of the Pantheon, a circular temple, now a church.|$|E
25|$|According to Silva Lake, textual critic, {{the text}} of the codex is a {{somewhat}} dilute form of family Π, with a large number of peculiar readings, most of which are either misspellings or careless and ignorant mistakes. An educated scribe <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> produced the variants in Mark 4:1; 6:26; 9:4; 13:3; 14:38; 16:4. The readings which it does not share with other representatives of Family Π are supported outside that family and they seem to be connected with the late Alexandrian group (C, L, M, N, Δ), but the number of the Alexandrian readings is not high and according to Silva they are rather result of accident than influence of a foreign text-type.|$|E

25|$|Gerda, posing under several aliases {{including}} that of Mrs Albert Chapman, invited Sainsbury Seale to visit her, killed her, and took her identity; {{but she had to}} buy new shoes because those of Sainsbury Seale did not fit her. This is why the buckles on the shoes found on the corpse were dull, whereas the buckle of the woman whom Poirot met going into Morley's surgery was shiny: the fake Mabelle had newer shoes. The woman in the trunk <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> worn through a new pair of shoes in a single day. Ironically, the face of the corpse had been disfigured not because it wasn't Mabelle Sainsbury Seale, but because it was.|$|E
25|$|Timesitheus {{served as}} Praetorian Prefect for some {{three years from}} 241 {{until his death in}} 243. The only {{narrative}} source on his term of office is the SHA and, as already noted, the author of the Vita Tres Gordiani <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> been more fulsome in singing his praises, both as the father-in-law of the young emperor and as the protector of the Empire. This generous assessment is supported by two citations of supposed correspondence between Timesitheus and Gordian (probably invented) and a number of topoi familiarly used in Latin historiography to define a worthy servant of the state - i.e. a crackdown on sale of offices by members of the palatini, care for the defence of the frontiers and exemplary behaviour in his capacity as commander of the Praetorian Guard. The favourable view of Timesitheus's term of office entertained by the SHA is not challenged by modern scholars - although the inadequacy of the data is acknowledged.|$|E
25|$|The Pelagornithidae had {{extremely}} thin-walled bones widely pneumatized {{with the}} air sac extensions of the lungs. Most limb bone fossils are very much crushed for that reason. In life, the thin bones and extensive pneumatization enabled the birds to achieve large size while remaining below critical wing loadings. Though 25kg/m2 (5lb/ft2) {{is regarded as the}} maximum wing loading for powered bird flight, there is evidence that bony-toothed birds used dynamic soaring flight almost exclusively: the proximal end of the humerus had an elongated diagonal shape that <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> allowed for the movement necessary for the typical flapping flight of birds; their weight thus cannot be easily estimated. The attachment positions for the muscles responsible for holding the upper arm straightly outstretched were particularly well-developed, and altogether the anatomy seems to allow for an ability of holding the wings rigidly at the glenoid joint unmatched by any other known bird. This is especially prominent in the Neogene pelagornithids, and less developed in the older Paleogene forms. The sternum had the deep and short shape typical of dynamic soarers, and bony outgrowths at the keel's forward margin securely anchored the furcula.|$|E
60|$|But Pierre declined; {{and could}} not help thinking, that though in all human {{probability}} Plotinus well understood Millthorpe, yet Millthorpe <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> yet <b>have</b> wound himself into Plotinus;--though indeed Plotinus--who at times was capable of assuming a very off-hand, confidential, and simple, sophomorean air--might, for reasons best known to himself, have tacitly pretended to Millthorpe, that he (Millthorpe) had thoroughly wriggled himself into his (Plotinus') innermost soul.|$|R

25|$|Under {{the first}} Caliph, Abu Bakr, force {{was used to}} prevent unrest and {{rebellion}} from causing {{the collapse of the}} new Islamic state, and the first raids were carried out into the territory of the Sassanid Empire. But the all out attack on the neighboring empires came with the ascension of the second Caliph, Umar. When the new Caliph began his rule in 634, the international situation in the Middle East <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> been more propitious for a new and ambitious power: the region's two traditional main powers, the Byzantine and the Sassanid Empires, had exhausted each other in a conflict that raged for over 20 years. By the 630s, Sassanid Persia had descended into a state of civil war, while Byzantium, under the aging emperor Heraclius, its manpower and resources depleted in the struggle with its old adversary, was struggling to re-establish its authority in its newly re-conquered eastern provinces. The two states were thus in considerable internal turmoil, and unable to either stop the Muslim expansion or to recover from its first blows. It is unknown whether Umar intended from the outset to conquer both the Sassanid and the Byzantine Empire, or simply allowed raids, and then, perceiving their weakness, followed up with full-scale invasion.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to Zuckerman's version, the Primary Chronicle and the later Kiev Chronicle place Oleg's grave in Kiev, {{where it could}} be seen {{at the time of}} the compilation of these documents. Furthermore, scholars have pointed out that if Oleg succeeded Rurik in 879 (as the East Slavic chronicles assert), he <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> been active almost 70 years later, unless he had a life-span otherwise unheard of in medieval annals. To solve these difficulties, it has been proposed that the pagan monarch-priests of Rus' used the hereditary title of helgu, standing for [...] "holy" [...] in the Norse language, and that Igor and others held this title.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet Union was keen {{not to be}} left out.
