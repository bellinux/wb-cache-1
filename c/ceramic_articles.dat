40|$|David Huson and Katie Vaughan {{and colleagues}} at the Centre for Fine Print Research at the University of the West of England are {{continuing}} their research into the 3 D printing of ceramic bodies by investigating the possibilities of using techniques developed by the ancient Egyptians to produce a 3 D printed ceramic body that will glaze itself during a single firing process. The Centre for Fine Print Research at the University of the West of England has funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council for a three year research project entitled "Can Egyptian Paste Techniques (Faience) be used for 3 D printed, Solid Free-form Fabrication of Ceramics?" Now in {{the final year of}} the project this research aims to create a set of functional ceramic materials through a process based upon historic Egyptian Faience techniques, which will allow ceramic artists, designers and craftspeople to 3 D print actual objects in a material that can be glazed and vitrified in one firing; a breakthrough for ceramic design and manufacture. The two methods used in ancient Egypt to enable self-glazing in one firing are efflorescence glazing and cementation glazing: In efflorescence glazing soluble salts are introduced in to the body mix, after forming and during the drying stage these salts migrate {{to the surface of the}} formed article and during firing fuse and react with the body materials to form a glaze on the surface, by introducing colouring oxides such as cobalt, iron, manganese or copper into the mix a range of coloured glazes can be produced. In cementation glazing the article that has been formed is surrounded in a saggar (a refractory box used to support and protect a ceramic object during firing) by a powder consisting of a glaze precursor, during the firing process a reaction takes place between the <b>ceramic</b> <b>article</b> and the glaze precursor powder and a glaze is formed on to the surface of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>article,</b> the firing temperature is below the melting temperature of the glazing powder so that the glazed <b>ceramic</b> <b>article</b> can be removed from the powder bed in which it was fired. This paper will describe the development of a 3 D printable ceramic body with a glaze precursor powder for the cementation glazing process. (the initial development work was described in a paper presented at DF 2014) The process parameters, formulations and 3 D printing settings required will be detailed and images and examples of artefacts made by this process will be included. This is a new area of research to create a functional 3 D printed real ceramic material through a process based upon historic Egyptian Faience techniques, which will allow ceramic artists and designers to 3 D print objects in a material that can be glazed and vitrified in one low temperature energy efficient firing process, a potential breakthrough for ceramic design and manufacture which will be applicable to the arts and wider industries...|$|R

40|$|The colour {{overglaze}} {{of ceramic}} dinnerware may contain heavy metals like lead and cadmium. Depending {{on whether the}} ceramics were fired at high or low temperatures {{and what kind of}} foods are stored in them for what periods of time, heavy metals may be transferred. Ingested by humans, these heavy metals can cause adverse health effects. Children are particularly at risk. Vessels, from which lead and cadmium may be transferred, are described as articles from which a migration of lead or cadmium is possible. In order to prevent consumers being harmed by a lead or cadmium migration from ceramic vessels, maximum quantities of lead and cadmium transferred from <b>ceramic</b> <b>articles</b> were laid down on the European level in 1984. According to them, certain ceramic vessels may only transfer up to four milligrammes lead per litre. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) subjected the valid limits to a risk assessment. It was prompted to do this by the review of the European Directive on <b>ceramic</b> <b>articles</b> intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. Risk assessment gets {{complicated by the fact that}} no adequate data are available on how many consumers come into contact with heavy metals and to what extent. However, there is no doubt about it that specific population-groups can have a larger dietary intake of heavy metals because of their eating habits and lifestyle. Therefore, additional exposure via migration of lead or cadmium from ceramics should be reduced to a minimum. Regarding the valid limits of the EU the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) laid down by the World Health Organisation (WHO) may be considerably exceeded, depending on the calculation model. Particularly in view of the higher sensitivity of children, BfR recommends reducing the statutory limits for the migration of lead and cadmium from <b>ceramic</b> <b>articles...</b>|$|E
