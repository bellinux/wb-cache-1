With {{the help of his}} sons Adolphe and Émile-Maurice, Charles-Émile introduced saddlery and started selling his products retail. The company catered to the élite of Europe, North Africa, Russia, Asia, and the Americas. In 1900, the firm offered the Haut à <b>Courroies</b> bag, specially designed for riders to carry their saddles with them.|$|E
50|$|The {{prototype}} of the Kelly bag, introduced around 1892, was a large bag used for holding a saddle, and was known as Haut à <b>courroies</b> because of its high handle. In 1923, Émile-Maurice Hermès and Ettore Bugatti designed a thoroughly simple and plain bag for Hermès's wife Julie. It was meant {{to fit into a}} car door and to allow riders to carry their saddle. In the 1930s, Hermès's son-in-law Robert Dumas redesigned it as a spacious travel bag called Sac à dépêches. It was a sharp contrast to the dominant purses of the time, which were simple, small and flat, resembling envelopes. The handbag gradually went on to become stiff and boxy.|$|E

In 1935 Hermès created a top-handled leather bag called a sac à dépêches as part of their leather goods range. In 1956 this design was renamed the Kelly after being prominently worn by Grace Kelly. Coco Chanel first created her quilted-leather 2.55 in February 1955. In 1984, Hermès modified another of their designs, the Haut à <b>Courroies</b> (originally created around 1900) to create a bag for the actress and singer Jane Birkin. The Birkin subsequently {{became one of the most}} desirable, widely recognised bags during the 1990s and early 2000s designer bag craze.|$|E

He received a government grant that year that let him tour the cathedrals of the Île-de-France that year.While at the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts he met Jecques Gestalder, Emile Gilioli and Raymond Veysset, but is more often linked to the sculptors René Leleu and Noël Papet.In 1939 he made a bust of Ferdinand Barbaud that was placed in the horse abattoir of Paris, and a bust of Dr. Rouhet that was erected at Montségur on 2 July 1939.|$|R
