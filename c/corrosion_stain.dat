30|$|Additional {{testing was}} also {{performed}} on the specimens containing EA-B to determine where the variation in chlorides occurred. Two samples were taken near the anode and two sets of two samples were taken from concrete outside the “anode grid”. The tests revealed that chloride “hot spots” could be found near the anodes. Additionally, <b>corrosion</b> <b>staining</b> {{on the surface of}} the specimens was more severe in the vicinity of the anodes.|$|R
50|$|Carbon steel has {{a higher}} carbon content, which gives the steel a lower melting point, more {{malleability}} and durability, and better heat distribution. The disadvantages are the quick <b>corrosion</b> and <b>staining.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Concrete sealers {{are applied}} to {{concrete}} {{to protect it from}} surface damage, <b>corrosion,</b> and <b>staining.</b> They either block the pores in the concrete to reduce absorption of water and salts or form an impermeable layer which prevents such materials from passing.|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{studies of}} the {{environment}} have dealt primarily with toxic materials that may affect the health of man. Studies may also be made to evaluate nuisance effects and economic factors associated with <b>corrosion,</b> <b>staining</b> and damage to plant and animal life. It {{is important to note}} that many so-called pollutants are also essential trace elements. Analytical {{studies of the}} environ-ment, therefore, should provide a broad background of knowledge for a true evaluation of the nature of the environment and changes that are taking place. A brief review of toxic and carcinogenic materials reveals that there are many hazards to man that are present in the environment. Analytical methods for studying water quality and ambient atmospheres are of critical importance. The analytical problems are very complex and there is great need for a concerted effort to develop suitable analytical procedures and to collect reliable analytical data. It may surprise many to learn that although waters have been analysed for many centuries, no one has yet truly determined the nature and amoun...|$|R
5|$|Donecle uses a {{swarm of}} drones {{equipped}} with laser sensors and micro-cameras. The algorithms for automatic detection of defects, trained on existing images database with a machine learning software, are able to identify various elements: texture irregularities, pitot probes, rivets, openings, text, defects, <b>corrosion,</b> oil <b>stains.</b> A damage report is sent on the operator's touch pad with each area of interest and the proposed classification with a probability percentage. After reviewing the images, the verdict is pronounced by a qualified inspector.|$|R
50|$|Wine racks made of {{stainless}} steel are perfect to store wine bottles in the kitchen due to the material's resistance to <b>corrosion</b> and <b>staining.</b> Stainless steel can be easily cleaned and {{it may also be}} 100% recycled. This material has the greatest resistance to oxidation and so it does not rust. Stainless steel wine racks are increasing in popularity because of their ability to maintain the quality and appearance for longer periods of time, especially in a humid space such as the kitchen.|$|R
25|$|Steel is {{the strongest}} {{commonly}} available fiber, and comes in different lengths (30 to 80mm in Europe) and shapes (end-hooks). Steel fibers can only be used on surfaces that can tolerate or avoid <b>corrosion</b> and rust <b>stains.</b> In some cases, a steel-fiber surface is faced with other materials.|$|R
50|$|Mn is {{considered}} a secondary contaminant, which includes substances in water that cause offensive taste, odour, colour, <b>corrosion,</b> foaming, or <b>staining</b> but have no direct effect on health (Herman, 1996). In fact, small concentrations of Mn in our diet are essential to human health (Keen et al., 1999).|$|R

50|$|Stainless steel’s {{resistance}} to <b>corrosion</b> and <b>staining,</b> low maintenance, and familiar lustre {{make it an}} ideal material for many applications. The alloy is milled into coils, sheets, plates, bars, wire, and tubing {{to be used in}} cookware, cutlery, household hardware, surgical instruments, major appliances, industrial equipment (for example, in sugar refineries) and as an automotive and aerospace structural alloy and construction material in large buildings. Storage tanks and tankers used to transport orange juice and other food are often made of stainless steel, because of its corrosion resistance. This also influences its use in commercial kitchens and food processing plants, as it can be steam-cleaned and sterilized and does not need paint or other surface finishes.|$|R
500|$|For {{the last}} few decades the Burnside Fountain has been in disrepair. A 1986 {{inventory}} of public memorials in Worcester, compiled by the municipal parks and recreation department, listed the fountains problems as [...] "chipped stone, water system, bronze surface <b>corrosion,</b> rust <b>staining,</b> litter," [...] and the Smithsonian Art Inventories Catalog surveyed the fountain in September 1994 and listed its condition as [...] "treatment urgent." [...] With the one-hundredth anniversary of the Burnside Fountain coming in 2012, there has been renewed interest in restoring the fountain. Restoration estimates run between USD $40,000 to $60,000, which is more than the city is willing to spend. Probably because of this, there are no official plans to restore the fountain, as of June 2012.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to determine the Impact of Gas flaring i. e. Associated Gas (AG) on the built environment by Oil and Gas production and prospecting companies operating in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area (ONELGA), Rivers State of Nigeria. Data for the study was obtained from both primary and secondary sources. Instruments such as Questionnaire, Interview and Observation methods were used for data collection from individuals and Oil and Gas companies in the area while simple percentage and tables were used for data analysis. The study {{came up with the}} following findings that; Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni area is immensely polluted with various pollutants ranging from acid rain, carbon monoxides, heavy metals and lead compounds. The impacted variables include <b>corrosion,</b> leakage, <b>staining</b> and cracking on buildings/structures, artifacts, monuments, human health among others. However, given these findings, the study has been able to proffer recommendations which if taken into effective practice will help mitigate the consequences on the people and the built environment...|$|R
50|$|In modern laboratories, carboys {{are usually}} made of plastic, though {{traditionally}} were (and still {{are in many}} university settings) made of ferric glass or other shatter-resistant glasses immune to acid <b>corrosion</b> or halide <b>staining</b> common in older plastic formulations. They are used to store large quantities of liquids, such as solvents or deionised water. In these applications, a tap may be included for dispensing. Carboys are also used to collect and store waste solvents. Collecting waste solvents in plastic carboys is preferable to reusing glass Winchesters due to the lesser chance of breakage if a solution is placed in an incorrectly labeled carboy.|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of {{several aspects of}} the weathering of roofing materials is presented. Degradation of materials initiated by ultraviolet radiation is discussed for plastics used in roofing, as well as wood and asphalt. Elevated temperatures accelerate many deleterious chemical reactions and hasten diffusion of material components. Effects of moisture include decay of wood, acceleration of <b>corrosion</b> of metals, <b>staining</b> of clay, and freeze-thaw damage. Soiling of roofing materials causes objectionable stains and reduces the solar reflectance of reflective materials. (Soiling of non-reflective materials can also increase solar reflectance.) Soiling {{can be attributed to}} biological growth (e. g., cyanobacteria, fungi, algae), deposits of organic and mineral particles, and to the accumulation of flyash, hydrocarbons and soot from combustion...|$|R
