40|$|Smear layer, smear plugs, sensitivity, microleakage, sodium hypochlorite, {{chemical}} bonding. The smear {{layer is}} created on hard tissues of the teeth whenever they are cut with hand or rotary instruments. This thin (1 - 2 microns) layer of denatured <b>cutting</b> <b>debris</b> is very tenacious {{and is often}} the surface to which restorative materials are luted. The solubility characteristics, chemical reactivity and the structure-function relationships of this layer have not been well-defined. During creation of the smear layer, <b>cutting</b> <b>debris</b> is forced into variable distances into dentinal tubules. These so-called smear plugs, together with the smear layer decreases dentin permeability, dentin sensitivity and surface wetness. Bonding adhesive resins to smear layers appears to limit the theoretical bond strength unless the smear layers are loosened or partially removed. While confusion persists whether the smear layer should be kept or removed in restorative dentistry, removal of this layer {{is important for the}} success of endodontic treatment. Its removal is obtained using chemical solutions during root canal preparation such as Ethylene Diamine Tetra acetic acid (EDTA) preparations, combination of EDTA and sodium hypochlorite solutions, organic acids and lasers. The aim {{of this paper is to}} briefly review general concepts concerning the smear layer: its structure and composition, role of smear layer in restorative dentistry and endodontics...|$|E
40|$|A report {{presents}} {{the concept of}} a machine aboard the space shuttle that would cut oversized thermal-tile blanks to precise sizes and shapes needed to replace tiles that were damaged or lost during ascent to orbit. The machine would include a computer-controlled jigsaw enclosed in a clear acrylic shell that would prevent escape of <b>cutting</b> <b>debris.</b> A vacuum motor would collect the debris into a reservoir and would hold a tile blank securely in place. A database stored in the computer would contain the unique shape and dimensions of every tile. Once a broken or missing tile was identified, its identification number would be entered into the computer, wherein the cutting pattern associated with that number would be retrieved from the database. A tile blank would be locked into a crib in the machine, the shell would be closed (proximity sensors would prevent activation of the machine while the shell was open), and a "cut" command would be sent from the computer. A blade would be moved around the crib like a plotter, cutting the tile to the required size and shape. Once the tile was cut, an astronaut would take a space walk for installation...|$|E
40|$|Smouldering {{combustion}} in burning piles was experimentally {{investigated by}} studying temperature changes in six piles of 2 m of diameter of <b>cutting</b> <b>debris</b> of hazel (Corylus avellana) {{for three days}} after extinction. The piles were monitored using an IR camera and K-type thermocouples. The experiment was designed in order to study how the maximum temperature of the charcoal might {{be influenced by the}} individual and interaction effects of both the quality of extinction and the elapsed time until the start of extinction of the piles. The piles that were properly extinguished (i. e. using a high-pressure, homogeneously distributed water flow of 50 l/min for 4 min) had a uniform temperature profile and did not have significant hot spots. The temperature reached equilibrium with the environment in less than 10 h after extinction. In contrast, a smouldering front moved throughout the poorly extinguished piles, which had a wide temperature distribution and hot spots of up to 700 °C. A simulation of windy conditions after three days of experiments on a poorly extinguished pile showed that the reactivation of charcoal combustion was possible. It gave a high-risk scenario to cause a wildfire, with hot smouldering embers being transported by wind flow. The results are of interest to improve pile burning protocols so that the number of wildfires caused by such practices may be reduced. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

Although it did not directly puncture any of the fuel tanks, it sent out a pressure shockwave that ruptured the number-five fuel tank at the weakest point, just above the undercarriage. Leaking fuel gushing out {{from the bottom of the}} wing was most likely ignited by an electric arc in the landing gear bay (<b>debris</b> <b>cutting</b> the landing gear wire) or through contact with hot parts of the engine.

40|$|During endodontic therapy, {{cleaning}} of root canals {{is performed using}} endodontic files and auxiliary chemical substances, {{and it is important}} that the endodontist be familiar with the instruments used in daily practice. This study evaluated, under scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the quality of the surface finishing of unused rotary endodontic instruments. Fifty sizes 20, 25 and 30 rotary files from different commercial brands (ProFile, Protaper, Race, Hero and K 3 Endo) were removed directly from their packages and had their final 3 mm examined with a scanning electron microscope at x 190 magnification with no previous preparation. The images were evaluated by 3 skillful, calibrated, blinded observers according to the following criteria: <b>cutting</b> edge, <b>debris,</b> grooves, microcavities, tip shape, tip position, scraping and transition angle. Data were recorded in worksheets designed for the study. Irregular edges were observed in 50 - 100 % of the files. Except for ProFile, all commercial brands presented surface debris in 100 % of samples. Only Race files showed no grooves or microcavities. K 3 Endo files presented the best tip centralization. Excetp for ProTaper files, all commercial brands presented blunt-cutting edges in 100 % of samples. All types of files presented surface scraping. K 3 Endo files and Protaper had a high percentage of transition angle. Based on the evaluation criteria used in the present study, most samples presented a minimum of 2 alterations and a maximum of 7 alterations per instrument. Under the tested conditions, the quality of the surface finishing of the examined instruments was not as expected, given that no instrument was free of imperfections and most of them presented at least 2 and up to 7 types of surface defects. These results suggest that the manufacturing process and the packaging conditions of rotary endodontic instruments are far from ideal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the degree of eccentricity between different tungsten carbide bur manufacturing techniques and to study the effect of bur inaccuracy on dental enamel. Error in bur concentricity may arise from malalignment of the steel shaft and carbide head in a two-piece construction bur. Cutting blades rotate at multiple radii from the shaft axis, potentially producing vibrations and damage to the cut substrate. Techniques now allow for the manufacture of one-piece tungsten carbide burs with strength adequate to withstand lateral loading. A comparison of tungsten carbide dental cutting tools revealed the true extent of concentricity errors. Variation in alignment of the cutting head and shaft in the two-part constructions incurred between 20 and 50 pm of additional axial error. High-speed cutting interactions with dental enamel between carbide burs were studied {{by means of a}} video-rate confocal microscope. A cutting stage fitted to a Tandem Scanning Microscope (TSM) allowed for real-time dynamic image acquisition. Images were captured and retrieved by means of a low-light-level camera recording directly to S-VHS videotape. Videotape showing the interactions of high-speed rotary cutting instruments (at 120, 000 rpm) were taken under simulated normal wet-cutting environments, and the consequent damage to the tooth tissue was observed as it occurred. Concentrically engineered bur types produced a superior quality cut surface at the entry, exit, and advancing front aspects of a cavity, as well as less subsurface cracking. Imaging of the coolant water film local to recent cutting operations showed regular spherical <b>cutting</b> <b>debris</b> of 6 to 18 pm diameter from the concentric tools, whereas the less-well-engineered burs produced ragged, irregular chips, with 25 - 40 pm diameter debris, indicating far more aggressive cutting actions. This study has shown that there is reduced substrate damage with high-concentricity carbide burs...|$|E
40|$|The {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD) is the joint {{of the spine}} connecting vertebra to vertebra. It functions to transmit loading of the spine and give flexibility to the spine. It composes of three compartments: the innermost nucleus pulposus (NP) encompassing by the annulus fibrosus (AF), and two cartilaginous endplates connecting the NP and AF to the vertebral body on both sides. Discogenic pain possibly caused by degenerative {{intervertebral disc}} disease (DDD) and disc herniations {{has been identified as}} a major problem in our modern society. To study possible mechanisms of IVD degeneration, in vitro organ culture systems with live disc cells are highly appealing. The in vitro culture of intact bovine coccygeal IVDs has advanced to a relevant model system, which allows the study of mechano-biological aspects in a well-controlled physiological and mechanical environment. Bovine tail IVDs can be obtained relatively easy in higher numbers and are very similar to the human lumbar IVDs with respect to cell density, cell population and dimensions. However, previous bovine caudal IVD harvesting techniques retaining cartilaginous endplates and bony endplates failed after 1 - 2 days of culture since the nutrition pathways were obviously blocked by clotted blood. IVDs are the biggest avascular organs, thus, the nutrients to the cells in the NP are solely dependent on diffusion via the capillary buds from the adjacent vertebral body. Presence of bone debris and clotted blood on the endplate surfaces can hinder nutrient diffusion {{into the center of the}} disc and compromise cell viability. Our group established a relatively quick protocol to "crack"-out the IVDs from the tail with a low risk for contamination. We are able to permeabilize the freshly-cut bony endplate surfaces by using a surgical jet lavage system, which removes the blood clots and <b>cutting</b> <b>debris</b> and very efficiently reopens the nutrition diffusion pathway to the center of the IVD. The presence of growth plates on both sides of the vertebral bone has to be avoided and to be removed prior to culture. In this video, we outline the crucial steps during preparation and demonstrate the key to a successful organ culture maintaining high cell viability for 14 days under free swelling culture. The culture time could be extended when appropriate mechanical environment can be maintained by using mechanical loading bioreactor. The technique demonstrated here can be extended to other animal species such as porcine, ovine and leporine caudal and lumbar IVD isolation...|$|E
40|$|The {{drilling}} process is generally costly and time consuming {{and prone to}} serious hazards. Cost-efficiency and enhanced safety measures are vital for any drilling operation. Recent studies indicate that poor reliability in the {{drilling process}} resulted {{in as much as}} 30 % loss of production time. Improved sensor technology with process automation can improve process performance and safety. During drilling operations, along with the drillstring, a drilling fluid, commonly very dense and viscous fluid, is circulated in a closed flow-loop. The drilling fluid, non-Newtonian in its rheological behavior, serves three main objectives: keeping the bottom-hole pressure at an acceptable level, lubricating the drill bit and facilitating the removal of <b>cuttings</b> and <b>debris</b> from downhole. These three goals have to be kept in balance and are achieved by adjusting the density (ρ), viscosity (μ) and the flow-rate (qv) of the drilling fluid. These three drilling process parameters need to be continuously monitored for optimizing process performance and securing safety. The cuttings in the drilling fluids make it especially challenging when conventional in-line sensor systems are used due to the unavoidable erosion and maintenance costs. Non-invasive ultrasonic measurement techniques can be part of a robust and easily implementable control and monitoring system. In this work ultrasonic properties of different drilling fluids are studied. Propagational properties of different samples of drilling fluids are studied with focus on attenuation and frequency characteristics in transmission mode. Experimental results using different sets of ultrasonic transducers with different frequencies, confirm the high attenuation of ultrasonic pulses. A model is proposed to estimate the attenuation and viscosity of the drilling fluid based on ultrasonic and rheological parameters. This study presents results from ultrasonic interrogation of non-Newtonian fluids with focus on their rheological properties...|$|R

40|$|Swath {{bathymetric}} and sub-bottom profiler data {{reveal a}} variety of submarine landforms such as gullies, slide scars, subtle shelf edge-parallel ridges and elongated depressions, and small debris flows along the continental shelf break and upper slope of West Antarctica. Gullies <b>cutting</b> through <b>debris</b> flow deposits on the Belgica Trough Mouth Fan (TMF) suggest formation after full-glacial deposition on the continental slope. The gullies were most likely eroded by sediment-laden subglacial meltwater flows released from underneath the ice margin grounded at the shelf edge {{at the onset of}} deglaciation. Scarcity of subglacial meltwater flow features on the outer shelf suggests that the meltwater reached the shelf edge mainly either through the topmost layer of soft diamict or in the form of dispersed flow beneath the ice, although locally preserved erosional channels indicate that more focused and higher-energy flows also existed. Concentration of gullies on the upper continental slope in front of the marginal areas of the major cross-shelf troughs, as contrasted to their axial parts, is indicative of higher-energy gully-eroding processes there, possibly due to additional subglacial meltwater flow from beneath the slow moving ice lying over the higher banks of the troughs. The shallow and sinuous gully heads observed on the outermost shelf within the Pine Island West Trough may indicate postglacial modification by near-bed currents resulting either from the subglacial meltwater flow from underneath the ice margin positioned at some distance landward from the shelf edge, or from the currents formed by brine rejection during sea ice formation. On the continental slope outside major troughs, slide scars as well as shelf-edge parallel ridges and elongated depressions indicate an unstable and failure-prone uppermost slope, although failures were probably mainly associated with rapid sediment loading during glacial periods. Complex, cauliflower- and amphitheatre-shaped gully heads biting back into the shelf edge suggest upslope retrogressive, multi-stage small-scale sliding as a contributing factor to the formation of gullies in these areas. Small debris fans immediately downslope of the slide scars suggest that small-scale debris flows have been the main downslope sediment transfer processes in the areas of weak or absent subglacial meltwater flow.

40|$|ARIES {{consists}} of a 6 -wheeled K 3 A mobile platform, a compact subturret, a sonar imaging system, a laser-based {{light detection and ranging}} (lidar) navigation beacon system, and a camera positioning system. It has a sonar imaging system used in navigation and collision avoidance and an automatic docking/charging system. Drum-referencing algorithms and camera-positioning algorithms have been included in the primitive instruction set for the robot. The robot`s navigation is based on Synchro-Drive, a patented design that utilizes concentric shafts to distribute drive and steering power to the six wheels simultaneously. ARIES uses a virtual path concept in which only a limited amount of information needs to be provided to the control computer {{in order to get the}} vehicle moving. The safety and health evaluation, during the human factors assessment, found several areas of concern including ergonomics, laser hazards, tripping hazards, fall-from-above and struck-by hazards, electrical hazards, and decontamination of the system. BOA is a self-propelled automated mini-enclosure, able to remove insulation from installed pipes, primarily of 4 inch nominal outside diameter. The system is designed for two operators: one oversees the abatement head operation from a distance of 10 or 15 feet using a pendant control and the other bags the debris at a cyclonic bagging station that is attached by a vacuum hose to the cutting head. Since the abatement head is its own enclosure, there may be no need for further enclosures to be built. The system wets and removes asbestos insulation automatically, <b>cutting</b> the <b>debris</b> into consistent chunks and moving the wave under a strong vacuum to a bagging machine. Prior to reaching the bagging operation, the material passes through a water separator which greatly reduces the weight of the debris and allows recirculation of water, after sufficient filtration. The safety and health evaluation, during the human factors assessment, focused on: noise, dust concentrations, ergonomics, and computer software. Industrial hygiene sampling indicated that worker exposures may be kept low enough during normal operation of BOA to eliminate the need for respiratory or heating protection while working around the cutting head and bagging operation. Airborne particulate measurements showed a slight rise over background levels during the operation of BOA, but the average of all the readings during operation was 1. 6 % of the OSHA respirable dust standard. Air sampling and noise monitoring showed dust to be negligible. Noise was shown to be a potential exposure hazard depending on worker location...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{defects in}} ProTaper shaping instrument S 1 after a defined schedule of clinical use. Methodology: Among all ProTaper files discarded from an endodontic clinic at a stomatological school in China {{over a period}} of 17 months, 122 S 1 instruments were collected. They were ultrasonically cleaned, autoclaved and then examined in the laboratory. Any instrument separation was noted; the average length involved was determined. The 0. 5 mm region on either side of this length of discarded but intact instruments was examined circumferentially by scanning electron microscope. The region adjacent to the broken end of the fractured instruments was also examined in the same way. Results: One specimen was lost during processing. Of the remaining 121 instruments, 27 were separated with a mean fracture length of 3. 67 mm from the tip. Of these, two files showed macroscopically torsional fracture and the others showed signs of flexural fatigue. Only one file that had not fractured showed visible unwinding defects. Examination of the 3. 1 - 4. 1 mm region of other unfractured instruments revealed the presence of microcracks, surface debris, pitting and/or wear of their <b>cutting</b> edges. Some <b>debris</b> particles seemed to have been trapped in crack-like structures. Conclusions: Multiple use of ProTaper S 1 predisposed the instrument to microcrack formation and wear of the cutting edges. There was a low prevalence of plastic deformation and most ProTaper S 1 instruments failed without discernible sign of unwinding of the flutes. Further studies should address the mode of failure and the role of debris particles in the fracture mechanism. © 2005 International Endodontic Journal. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
