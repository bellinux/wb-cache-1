25|$|In March 1945 the Allies were {{preparing}} a new offensive, Operation Buckland, in Northern Italy. The capture of Bologna, an important regional <b>communication</b> <b>hub,</b> was set {{as a part}} of that offensive. The Allied forces tasked with this were composed of the US 5th Army (II Corps, South African 6th Armoured Division) and the British 8th Army (which for that part of the theatre, was composed of the V Corps and the Polish II Corps). The German units defending the area were composed of the German 26th Panzer Division of the XIV Panzer Corps, the 1st Parachute Division and the 4th Parachute Division of the I Parachute Corps. German defenses in that region were part of the Army Group C, defending the Paula Line.|$|E
500|$|A special {{committee}} {{was assigned to}} organize the 1952 Games, which consisted of four Norwegian sports officials and four representatives from the municipality of Oslo, including mayor Brynjulf Bull. [...] The committee was in place by December 1947. [...] The city of Oslo funded the Games entirely, in exchange for keeping all the revenue generated. [...] To accommodate the influx of athletes and coaches, quarters for competitors and support staff were designed and constructed, with three new facilities (forerunners of the athlete's villages of later Games) built. [...] The city of Oslo paid {{to have a new}} hotel constructed, the Viking, used for IOC delegates, out-of-town dignitaries, and as the <b>communication</b> <b>hub</b> of the Games. For {{the first time in a}} Winter Games, an indoor ice hockey arena was constructed, which hosted the eight-team tournament. [...] Oslo's existing central arena, Bislett Stadium, was used for the opening and closing ceremonies, and for speed skating events. Improvements to the arena included better sound and lighting systems, remodeled club house and press rooms, and the addition of a medical center.|$|E
