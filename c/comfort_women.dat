5|$|Japan's {{relationship}} with South Korea has been strained due to Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly {{over the issue}} of <b>comfort</b> <b>women.</b> These women were essentially sex slaves, and although there is no exact number on how many women were subjected to this treatment, experts believe it could be in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Between 1910–1945, the Japanese government rebuilt Korean infrastructure, introduced over 800,000 Japanese immigrants onto the peninsula, and carried out a campaign of cultural suppression through efforts to ban the Korean language in schools and force Koreans to adopt Japanese names. With the surrender of Japan and the Axis at the end of WWII in 1945, the Korean Peninsula was once again independent. Despite their historical tensions, in December 2015, Japan agreed to settle the <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology, taking responsibility for the issue and paying money to the surviving <b>comfort</b> <b>women.</b> Today, South Korea and Japan have a stronger and more economically-driven relationship. Since the 1990s, the Korean Wave has created a large fanbase in East Asia, but most notably in Japan. Japan is the number one importer of Korean music (K-pop), television (K-dramas), and films, but this was only made possible after the South Korean government lifted the 30-year ban on cultural exchange with Japan that had been in place since 1948. Korean pop cultural products' success in the Japanese market is partially explained by the borrowing of Japanese ideas such as the star-marketing system and heavy promotion of new television shows and music. Korean dramas such as Winter Sonata and Coffee Prince, as well as K-pop artists such as BIGBANG and SHINee are extremely popular with Japanese consumers. Most recently, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the 2017 G-20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany to discuss the future of their relationship and specifically how to cooperate on finding solutions for North Korean aggression in the region. Both leaders restated their commitment to solving the <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> dispute, building positive relations in the region, and pressuring China to be more assertive with North Korea as it continues to test nuclear weapons and isolate themselves further form the international community.|$|E
5|$|There were at most 20,000 <b>comfort</b> <b>women.</b> None of {{them were}} {{forcibly}} recruited. Forty percent {{of them were}} from Japan, the most heavily represented nation. Many were sold to brokers by their parents. Some responded willingly to brokers' offers; others were deceived. I would add that, on the average, living conditions in the comfort stations were practically identical to those in brothels set up for American troops during the Vietnam War.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, about 450,000 Korean male laborers were involuntarily sent to Japan. <b>Comfort</b> <b>women,</b> {{who served}} in Japanese {{military}} brothels {{as a form of}} sexual slavery, came from all over the Japanese empire. They numbered somewhere from 10,000 to 200,000, and they included an unknown number of Koreans. However, 200,000 {{is considered to be a}} conservative number by modern historians, and up to 500,000 <b>comfort</b> <b>women</b> are estimated to be taken. These women faced an average of 29 men and up to 40 men per day, according to one surviving comfort woman. However, of the 500,000, less than 50 are alive today. <b>Comfort</b> <b>women</b> were often recruited from rural locales with the promise of factory employment; business records, often from Korean subcontractees of Japanese companies, showed them falsely classified as nurses or secretaries.

40|$|Beloved and <b>Comfort</b> <b>Woman</b> {{have been}} {{analyzed}} {{using a variety}} of critical methodologies. One critical frame that has been absent from that dialogue is the academic discipline of trauma studies. Since these texts are written for and about national traumas, the theory oftrauma is a logical tool in which to unpack and advance the ideas imbedded within these texts. Trauma studies reveals how Beloved and <b>Comfort</b> <b>Woman</b> guard against the innate silencing tendencies ofthe traumatic experience. Through these texts, trauma speaks. More importantly, fixing the events oftrauma within Beloved and <b>Comfort</b> <b>Woman</b> ensures that national traumas are never forgotten. In short, each text prevents historical amnesia. Toni Morrison and Nora Okja Keller use literature as a vehicle in which to explore the absence of a traumatic listener and interrogate the difficulties in remembering an event that simultaneously confounds memorial. Each author recognizes the epistemological dilemma created in deciphering a past that is, by its traumatic nature, incomprehensible. Morrison and Keller confirm, in their character portrayals, that the very act ofliving through and testifying to the traumatic experience is invariably problematic. They illustrate the difficulties in understanding the unknowable and speaking the unspeakable. Each work mimics the clinical progression oftrauma, but more importantly, offers fresh ways to think about and understand the experience of trauma. Read next to and within the framework offered by trauma studies, Beloved and <b>Comfort</b> <b>Woman</b> can be reinterpreted and re-read not just as multicultural, postmodern narratives but as stories of and about trauma that advance the process of healing and survival...|$|R
