In this paper, we tackle the challenge of finding a successor node for each removed seed node to maintain the influence spread in the network. Given a social network and a set of seed nodes for influence maximization, the problem is to effectively choose successors to inherit the jobs of initial influence propagation when some seeds are removed from the network. To tackle this problem, we present and discuss five neighborhoodbased selection heuristics, including degree, degree discount, overlapping, <b>community</b> <b>bridge,</b> and community degree. Experiments on DBLP co-authorship network show the effectiveness of devised heuristics...|$|E

Therefore, its effective management must include {{the control of the}} timing of the delivery of each of the service's elements and the enhancement of the customer's experience between and during the delivery of the various elements. This paper provides a conceptual framework that links the duration of a service encounter to behaviors that have been shown to affect profitability. Analysis of the framework reveals a wide gap between the behavioral assumptions typically made in operations research (OR) and operations management (OM) models and {{the state of the art}} in the marketing and psychology literature. The central motivations behind this paper are (1) to help the OR and OM <b>community</b> <b>bridge</b> this gap by bringing to its attention recent findings from the behavioral literature that have implications for the design of queueing systems for service firms and (2) to identify opportunities for further research. psychology of waiting, marketing/operations interface, queueing, behavioral operations management, service encounters, service operations management, services marketing...|$|E
40|$|The global {{diffusion}} of epidemics, rumors and computer viruses causes great damage to our society. It {{is critical to}} identify the diffusion sources and promptly quarantine them. However, most methods proposed so far are unsuitable for large networks because of their computational cost and the complex spatiotemporal diffusion processes. In this paper, we develop a community structure based approach to efficiently identify diffusion sources in large networks. We first detect the community structure of a network and assign sensors on <b>community</b> <b>bridge</b> nodes to record diffusion dynamics. From the infection time of bridge sensors, we can determine the very first infected community from which the diffusion started and spread out to other communities. This, therefore, overcomes the scalability issue in source identification problems by narrowing the set of suspects down to the first infected community. Then, to accurately locate the diffusion source from suspects, we utilize an intrinsic feature of diffusion sources that the relative infection time of any node is linear with its effective distance from the diffusion source. Thus, for each suspect, we compute the correlation coefficient to measure the degree of linear dependence between sensors 2 ̆ 7 relative infection times and their effective distances from the suspect, and consider {{the one with the}} greatest correlation coefficient as the source. We evaluate our approach in two large networks containing more than 300, 000 nodes, which are collected from Twitter. The experiment results show that our method can identify diffusion sources with very high degree of accuracy. Especially when the average community size shrinks, the accuracy of our approach increases dramatically...|$|E
40|$|As {{communities}} {{continue to}} face {{issues relating to}} sustainability and with students demanding more university courses focused on solving these issues, a program that works to address both factors could prove beneficial. Modeled after the University of Oregon’s Sustainable Cities Initiative, the <b>Community</b> <b>Bridge</b> Initiative (CBI) at Utah State University aims to tackle specific community sustainability concerns by enlisting student and faculty expertise to create innovative ideas and provide increased capacity. While CBI {{is still in its}} pilot year, this thesis identified the benefits and challenges associated with the application of this program and provided recommendations to best implement this program once it leaves the pilot stage. Data were collected from a community needs assessment and from students enrolled in CBI pilot classes. The community needs assessment revealed that of 35 local organizations surveyed, 91 % wanted to partner with USU in efforts to address current and future issues, showing that CBI would have the needed community support should it choose to partner with local organizations on various issues. Organization needs included improving the communities of Cache Valley, educating the public about important issues and spreading awareness of their specific programs, and mitigating funding and physical resource issues. For partnerships, organizations were most interested in pairing with USU on education and volunteer initiatives and sustainability-based efforts. In regard to students enrolled in CBI courses, the program also gained student validation as 92 % of the students reported that the class positively impacted them, 88 % would take a CBI course again, 63 % would list the experience on their resume, and 73 % felt that the class was more effective in communicating course content in comparison to traditional USU courses. Following these results, full implementation of the CBI program at Utah State University is recommended...|$|E

40|$|Mutants of {{foot-and-mouth disease}} virus (FMDV) with altered {{biological}} properties can be selected {{during the course of}} persistent infection of BHK- 21 cells with FMDV C-S 8 c 1 (J. C. de la Torre, E. Martínez-Salas, J. Díez, A. Villaverde, F. Gebauer, E. Rocha, M. Dávila, and E. Domingo, J. Virol. 62 : 2050 - 2058, 1988). Two nucleotide substitutions, U to C at position - 376 and A to G at position - 15, (counting as + 1 the A of the first functional AUG), were fixed within the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of R 100, the virus rescued after 100 passages of the carrier BHK- 21 cells. IRES-directed cap-independent protein synthesis was quantitated by using bicistronic constructs of the form chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene-IRES-luciferase gene. The IRES from R 100 was 1. 5 - to 5 -fold more active than that of C-S 8 c 1 in directing cap-independent luciferase synthesis. This enhanced translational activity was observed when the RNAs were transcribed either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm by a weak or a strong promoter, respectively. C-S 8 c 1 and R 100 IRES elements were functional in both FMDV-sensitive and FMDV-resistant cells (including persistently infected R cells), indicating that factors mediating cap-independent protein synthesis are not limited in any of the analyzed cell lines. Constructs in which each of the two mutations in the R 100 IRES were analyzed separately indicate that the transition at position - 376 is responsible for the enhanced activity of the R 100 IRES. By estimating the effect that an increase in the initial translation efficiency may have on subsequent RNA replication steps, we suggest that the modifications in the IRES elements can account for the previously described hypervirulence of FMDV R 100 for BHK- 21 cells. The results show that a single point mutation in an IRES element of a picornavirus can cause an increase in translation efficiency.
