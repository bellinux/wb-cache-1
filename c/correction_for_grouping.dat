40|$|AbstractBackgroundTuberculous {{meningitis}} (TBM) and {{herpes simplex}} encephalitis (HSE) are common neurological diseases involving the brain parenchyma, and both can result in chronic epilepsy. Here, we identified possible variables affecting the prognosis of central nervous system (CNS) infection-related epilepsy. MethodsThe clinical seizure characteristics and demographic data of 20 TBM- and 55 HSE-related epilepsy patients were compared. Statistically significant prognostic variables were identified using multiple regression analysis. ResultsSex, age at infection, age at epilepsy onset, presence of seizures {{at the time of}} infection, latency period, and seizure characteristics between two groups were similar except for the pattern of brain lesions observed on the MRI and their overall prognosis. Patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) only comprised 30 % and 52. 7 % of the TBM and HSE groups, respectively. Encephalomalacia had a positive effect in the HSE group while HS had a negative effect in this group, but no significant effects were found in the TBM group. Through a multiple regression analysis with a <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> <b>group</b> effects, HS was associated with a poor prognosis. However, encephalomalacia was concomitantly associated with a good prognosis. In addition, a short latency period, with a one-year interval, and being male were both associated with a good prognosis, while the age at the onset of epilepsy was associated with a poor prognosis. ConclusionsThis study suggests that HS and encephalomalacia could have mutual but contradictory effects on the prognosis of CNS infection-related epilepsy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{health-related}} {{quality of}} life (QL) {{in a group of}} Dutch predialysis end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients prior to the initiation of dialysis, and to compare QL between patients with different intended initial dialysis treatments. DESIGN: In a prospective cohort study, demographic, clinical, and QL data were obtained from Dutch adult patients who were consecutively enrolled from 27 different centers 0 - 4 weeks prior to the beginning of their chronic dialysis treatment. PATIENTS: Of the 301 patients who completed the QL questionnaires (of a possible 337 enrolled patients), 152 intended to start with hemodialysis (pre-HD) and 149 patients with peritoneal dialysis (pre-PD). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Perceived QL of pre-HD and pre-PD patients. Quality of life was assessed with two generic health assessment instruments: the SF- 36 and the EuroQol. RESULTS: After <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> <b>group</b> differences, pre-HD patients scored consistently, but not significantly, lower for all separate dimensions of the SF- 36 and the overall health score of the EuroQol compared to pre-PD patients. However, analyzing the dimensions of the SF- 36 together, adjusted for case-mix, pre-HD patients scored significantly lower than pre-PD patients. Mean difference was 6. 5 points (p = 0. 04). CONCLUSION: Multivariate adjustment for known case-mix differences at the start of dialysis therapy was not sufficient to adjust for all patient selection effects on QL. Consequently, published QL comparisons between HD and PD in nonrandomized cohort studies should be interpreted with caution. Assessment of QL just before start of dialysis therapy and subsequent adjustment for baseline values may be the only valid alternative for randomized studie...|$|R
40|$|Light curve {{observations}} of the double-mode Cepheid TU Cas obtained by 10 different sets of observers on several photometric systems over a time span of 67 years were carefully studied to determine the fundamental and first overtone periods and their amplitudes on the V magnitude scale. The presence of a second overtone radial pulsation is discussed, and it is concluded that a previous detection of this mode was spurious {{due to the lack}} of a proper zero point <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> two <b>groups</b> of observations. The amplitudes of the two modes are shown to possibly vary during the entire observing period with the fundamental mode amplitude of 0. 69 + or - 0. 03 and the overtone amplitude decreasing about 0. 2 or 0. 3 magnitude. If this Cepheid displays the two pulsation modes because it is mode switching, this switching time scale might be less than a hundred years...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Improvement in {{localized}} bone regeneration {{is needed}} to avoid the use of autogenous tissue. For that purpose, the use biologic mediators was proposed. The aim was to test whether or not one of two biologic mediators, recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) or recombinant platelet-derived growth factor (rhPDGF-BB), is superior {{to the other and}} to control <b>groups</b> <b>for</b> localized bone regeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four cylinders (height: 5  mm; diameter: 7  mm) were screwed on the parietal and frontal bones at the cranium in 12 rabbits. The cylinders either received (i) deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) mixed rhBMP- 2 (DBBM/BMP- 2), (ii) DBBM mixed with rhPDGF-BB (DBBM/PDGF), (iii) DBBM (DBBM), and (iv) empty control (control).

40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} is to further {{investigate}} the growth effects of structural reforms in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Although some work on the topic already exists this is based on dynamic panel data models where reforms are measured by means of the Reform Indexes, originally calculated by Lora et al. (1997) and then extended by Morley et al. (1999) for the period 1970 - 1995. Now, with much of the reform effort in LAC countries concentrated in the end of the 80 s and in the beginning of the 90 s, an empirical analysis with observations up to 1995 might not be enough for a correct detection of growth effects of structural reforms. Moreover, previous results might be driven by the estimation strategy too.;Within this frame, this paper tries to contribute in both ways. Firstly, an actualized version of the Reform Indexes(Escaith et al. (2003)) is used with observations up to 2000. Secondly, differently from previous studies, the estimation strategy is based on the adoption of Within Group estimator and Kiviet(1995) <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> Within <b>Group</b> estimator when, given the number of cross-section units, a shorter time dimension is at hand. Results are compared to estimates from Arellano and Bondo first difference estimator. Finally a sensitivity analysis is performed in order to check the robustness of results. ...|$|R

30|$|Since {{the share}} of ethnic {{minorities}} is small in the student population, background characteristics of Dutch students may dominate estimates. To verify the impact of variables within ethnic groups, we estimate separate parametric duration models for Mediterranean, Caribbean and Western in addition to Dutch. <b>For</b> each ethnic <b>group,</b> we estimate a model without <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> unobserved heterogeneity (Without) and another model with <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> unobserved heterogeneity (With UH), except for Caribbeans for whom a frailty model does not converge. Taking into account unobserved heterogeneity {{does not lead to}} large shifts in parameter estimates. The models with <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> unobserved heterogeneity generate only slightly different coefficients. From a comparison of these two models <b>for</b> other ethnic <b>groups,</b> we can assess, however that possible biases due to unobserved heterogeneity would be modest.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the value of dual-task performance for the prediction of falls inpatients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Two hundred sixty three patients with PD (H&Y 1 – 3, 65. 2 ± 7. 9 years) walked two times along a 10 -m trajectory, both under single-task and dual-task (DT) conditions (combined with an auditory Stroop task). To control for a cueing effect, Stroop stimuli were presented at variable or fixed 1 - or 2 -s intervals. The auditory Stroop task was also performed alone. Dual-task costs were calculated for gait speed, stride length, stride time, stride time variability, step and stride regularity, step symmetry and Stroop composite scores(accuracy/reaction time). Subsequently, falls were registered prospectively for 1 year (monthly assessments). Patients were categorized as non-recurrent fallers (no or 1 fall) or recurrent fallers ([1 falls). Recurrent fallers (35 %) had a significantly higher disease severity, lower MMSE scores, and higher Timed ‘‘Up & Go’’ test scores than non recurrent fallers. Under DT conditions, gait speed and stride lengths were significantly decreased. Stride time, stride time variability, step and stride regularity, and step symmetry did not change under DT conditions. Stroop dual-task costs were only significant for the 2 -s Stroop interval trials. Importantly, recurrent fallers did not show different dual-task costs compared to non-recurrent fallers on any of the gait or Stroop parameters. These results did not change after <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> baseline <b>group</b> differences. Deterioration of gait or Stroop performance under dual task conditions was not associated with prospective falls in this large sample of patients with PD...|$|R
40|$|Brain {{connectivity}} can {{be represented}} by a network that enables the comparison of the different patterns of structural and functional connectivity among individuals. In the literature, two levels of statistical analysis have been considered in comparing brain connectivity across groups and subjects: 1) the global comparison where a single measure that summarizes the information of each brain is used in a statistical test; 2) the local analysis where a single test is performed either for each node/connection which implies a multiplicity <b>correction,</b> or <b>for</b> each <b>group</b> of nodes/connections where each subset is summarized by one single test {{in order to reduce}} the number of tests to avoid a penalizing multiplicity correction. We comment on the different levels of analysis and present some methods that have been proposed at each scale.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the perception of}} facial asymmetry in young adults to identify the amounts of chin asymmetry that {{can be regarded as}} normal and may benefit from correction. Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional (3 D) images of 56 individuals of mixed ethnicity were obtained and used to produce average 3 D images of male and female faces. Distortion was then applied to these average faces using a 3 D graphics package to simulate different amounts of chin point asymmetry. Five observer groups (lay individuals, dental students, dental care professionals, dental practitioners, and orthodontists) assessed timed presentations of 3 D images, rating them as “normal,” “acceptable,” or “would benefit from correction. ” Time-to-event analysis was used to assess the level of chin asymmetry perceived as normal and beneficial <b>for</b> <b>correction</b> <b>for</b> each <b>group.</b> Results: The factors influencing the perception of facial asymmetry were the degree of asymmetry and the observer group. Direction of the asymmetry and gender of the assessed individual did not affect the perception of asymmetry, except in the 4 - to 6 -mm distortion range. The gender of the observer had no influence on perception. There were statistically significant differences in the amounts of asymmetry that the laypeople and orthodontists considered to be normal (5. 6 ± 2. 7 mm and 3. 6 ± 1. 5 mm, respectively; P <. 001) and felt would benefit from surgical correction (11. 8 ± 4. 0 mm and 9. 7 ± 3. 0 mm, respectively; P  = . 001). Conclusions: Perception of asymmetry is affected by the amount of asymmetry and the observer group, with orthodontists being more critical...|$|R

Methods: RCPET/CT scans of 19 non– small cell lung cancer patients were performed. List-mode PET and CT data were binned and reconstructed into 8 phases. Two AC methods for RCPET were applied. First, the correspond-ing 8 RCCT phases were used for PAC. Then MidV-AC was used. Analyses were performed in terms of standardized uptake values (SUVs), volume recovery, contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Results: Average differences between PAC and MidV-AC for mean and maximum SUV were 1. 0 % and 0. 9 % (P 5 0. 007 and P 5 0. 002), respectively, whereas SNR, contrast, and volume {{did not differ significantly}} (P $ 0. 2). Large motion amplitudes and irregular breathing revealed larger differences between phase 1 and MidV-AC values. Conclusion: Differences in SUV, volume, SNR, and contrast between PAC as available in currently used clinical software and MidV-AC for RCPET are small. MidV-AC provides an excellent surrogate for PAC for most lung cancer patients encountered in clinical practice...|$|R
