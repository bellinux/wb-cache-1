5|$|After {{returning}} to Argentina from Europe, Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated hairdos of her movie star days. The brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone, {{and even the}} style changed, her hair being pulled back severely into a heavy braided <b>chignon.</b> Additionally, her extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour. No longer did she wear the elaborate hats and form-fitting dresses of Argentine designers. Soon she adopted simpler and more fashionable Paris couture and became particularly attached to the fashions of Christian Dior and the jewels of Cartier. In an attempt to cultivate a more serious political persona, Eva {{began to appear in}} public wearing conservative though stylish tailleurs (a business-like combination of skirts and jackets), which also were made by Dior and other Paris couture houses.|$|E

25|$|Dancer in a café depicts strikingly fashionable {{women and}} men {{at the height of}} Parisian fashion in 1912. The dancer dressed in a directoire-style beaded and {{embroidered}} green silk velvet and chiffon caped evening gown embellished with celluloid sequins and gold trim, her hair coiffed in an elegant <b>chignon,</b> appears on a low stage or table performing for patrons or guests, all fashionably dressed and coiffed in silk and beaded net gowns, silver brocade and lace full-length gowns, ostrich-plumed hats, patterned suit, fedora and black tie. The artist depicts the figures and background as a series of subdivided facets and planes, presenting multiple aspects of the café scene simultaneously. This {{can be seen in the}} deliberate positioning of light, shadow, the nonconventional use of chiaroscuro, of form and color, and the way in which Metzinger assimilates the fusion of the background with the figures. The manifold surface has a complex geometry of reticulations with intricate series of (almost mathematical looking) black lines that appear in sections as underdrawing and in others as overdrawing.|$|E

500|$|It was {{recorded}} {{that during the}} Yuan dynasty, envoys were sent to Long Ya Men in 1320 to obtain tame elephants. The people of Long Ya Men then returned in 1325 with a tribute and trade mission to China. In around 1330, the traveller Wang Dayuan {{was said to have}} sailed through this passageway. In his travelogue Daoyi Zhilüe, he recorded that Long Ya Men was the two hills of Temasek between which a strait runs, and it was so called because the two hills looked like [...] "Dragon's teeth". Wang described the people of Long Ya Men as being prone to acts of piracy, and that while the natives traded with Chinese from Quanzhou, Chinese junks on their way back from the Western Oceans (西洋) may be met by pirates there who attacked with two to three hundred perahus (boats). He mentioned that in olden times a chief there found a jewelled head-dress while digging in the ground, and that [...] "the beginning of the year is calculated from the [...] rising of the moon, when the chief put on this head-gear and wore his [...] dress". [...] He also said the natives would [...] "gather their hair into a <b>chignon,</b> and wear short cotton bajus girded about with black cotton sarongs". The description of the people may be the first known record of the Orang Laut who inhabited the region. A different settlement called Ban Zu (班卒), described as being located on a hill behind Long Ya Men, is thought to be a transcription of the Malay Pancur and may be today's Fort Canning Hill.|$|E
2500|$|Călinescu saw Ranetti's verse as {{carried by}} his [...] "sufficient if amateurish culture", {{requiring}} {{of the reader}} [...] "a certain finesse". With his poetic debut as [...] "Dom Paladu", Ranetti parodied and impersonated George D. Pallade, the National Liberal Party politico, making abundant use of 1890s Bucharest slang. In his fictional avatar, Pallade appeared as [...] "a great carouser, something of a rube, and a lover of womenfolk". One such piece has Dom Paladu complaining about the arrival of autumn, which inevitably slows down his philandering—he expresses his wish to [...] "discuss matters of love with the ladies"—but not as socialists expect him to. Works in the genre include stanzas written in French for a Romanian public, translating Romanian idioms and proverbs in literal fashion. For instance, he referred to an insignificant loss as to a dommage en champignons (from the Romanian pagubă-n ciuperci, [...] "a waste of mushrooms"), and to a very unlikely situation as quand tu verrais ton <b>chignon</b> (când ți-oi vedea ceafa, [...] "when you'll be seeing your nape").|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, {{experts from}} the National Research Council of Canada {{conducted}} a three-dimensional infrared scan. Because of {{the aging of the}} varnish on the painting it is difficult to discern details. Data from the scan and infrared were used by Bruno Mottin of the French Museums' [...] "Center for Research and Restoration" [...] to argue that the transparent gauze veil worn by the sitter is a guarnello, typically used by women while pregnant or just after giving birth. A similar guarnello was painted by Sandro Botticelli in his Portrait of Smeralda Brandini (c.1470/1475), depicting a pregnant woman on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Furthermore, this reflectography revealed that Mona Lisas hair is not loosely hanging down, but seems attached {{at the back of the}} head to a bonnet or pinned back into a <b>chignon</b> and covered with a veil, bordered with a sombre rolled hem. In the 16th century, hair hanging loosely down on the shoulders was the customary style of unmarried young women or prostitutes. This apparent contradiction with her status as a married woman has now been resolved.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately after Desert Fury, Wallis {{began work}} on Deadlock, the {{original}} project name for Beggars Are Coming to Town. Again Miller would be cast with Desert Furys Burt Lancaster and Wendell Corey. After weeks of rehearsals on the Modjeska Canyon location, {{under the direction of}} Byron Haskin, Miller suddenly became the second leading lady. Lizabeth Scott, ever competitive with all actresses, grabbed the Kay role for herself. Miller later recalled, [...] "(Wallis) planned to star me in 'I Walk Alone.' He tested me with Burt; it was a wonderful test. But then Lizabeth Scott decided she wanted the role, and Lizabeth got whatever she wanted—from Hal Wallis! [...] So, I got the second part instead." [...] The 21-year-old Miller was recast as the slumming socialite divorcée, Alexis Richardson. Miller was afraid that playing a [...] "meanie" [...] role might typecast her. She was also forced to cut her 22-inch hair into a shorter <b>chignon.</b> In designing Miller's wardrobe, Edith Head was impressed by Miller's physique, describing it as [...] "the most exciting figure since Betty Grable." [...] The resulting film was renamed I Walk Alone (1948). Shooting took place early December 1946–mid-February 1947. The film was released January 16, 1948. She was 5th-billed after Kirk Douglas. Despite Miller's fears of being typecast as a femme fatale, film historians tend to typecast her [...] "as always playing the 'good girl.'" [...] Typecasting reflected real life as Miller's name seldom appeared in gossip columns and when it did, never involved scandal. Though Miller participated in the Hollywood dating circuit, the one name that invariably appeared in the press was William Haskel Schuyler, a television pioneer and consultant based in San Francisco. In late November 1947, it was announced that Miller and Schuyler would wed. But the marriage was postponed.|$|E

5000|$|Louis Alexandre Raimon (6 September 1922 [...] - [...] 3 January 2008), {{better known}} as Alexandre de Paris, was a famous French hairdresser ("maître coiffeur"). He was {{responsible}} for creating Elizabeth Taylor's coiffure in the 1963 Hollywood epic Cleopatra (1963 film). He also styled Greta Garbo, Audrey Hepburn and Lauren Bacall, among others. He was nicknamed the [...] "Prince de la coiffure", [...] "d'Artagnan de la coiffure", [...] "Sphinx de la coiffure", and [...] "Figaro."His signature <b>chignons</b> (knot or a coil of hair arranged {{in the back of}} the head)and his flamboyant style made him famous, setting fashions in hairstyling for decades.|$|R
60|$|Here {{began their}} adventures, {{properly}} speaking.

60|$|As {{soon as the}} hairdresser {{understood}} {{exactly what}} Ralph wanted, he entered heartily into his plans; {{and several of the}} short flat bands of black hair, used for <b>chignons,</b> were sewn on to a band. This was fastened on to Ralph's head, in the way he had suggested; the long tresses were cut to the required length; the tongs were used on them, and on the natural hair; and plenty of oil put on and, in an hour, his headdress was perfect--an immense bush of frizzly hair. The cloth was taken from round his neck and, as he looked at himself in the glass, he joined heartily in Percy's shout of laughter.|$|R

60|$|Kambira was not demonstrative, {{but he was}} hearty.

60|$|She {{would have}} taken Miss Slater for the strong-minded female far rather than this small slim person, with the {{complexion}} going with the yellower species of red hair and <b>chignon,</b> not unlike a gold- pheasant's, while the thin aquiline nose made Cecil think of Queen Elizabeth. The dress was a tight-fitting black silk, with a gorgeous many-coloured gold-embroidered oriental mantle thrown loosely over it, and a Tyrolean hat, about {{as large as the}} pheasant's comb, tipped over her forehead, with cords and tassels of gold; and she made little restless movements and whispered remarks during the speeches.|$|E

I must have a band of this hair, long enough to go round the head, from just above one ear to just above the other. If you part my hair, just at the place where the band is to go; brush the hair up; put the band of artificial hair on, with shoemaker's wax, or something else to hold tight; then brush the hair back again over the band, it would be absolutely impossible to see it was not all natural. Then cut the long hair so as to lie on my coat collar, frizzle it and the natural hair, and I will defy the keenest-eyed Prussian to see anything wrong about it." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{reader will}} doubtless {{remember}} the promise which Arabella {{had made to}} Mr. Gibson. That promise she had already fulfilled,--to the amazement {{of her mother and}} sister;--and when Miss Stanbury entered the room the elder daughter of the family was seen without her accustomed head-gear. If the truth is to be owned, Miss Stanbury gave the poor young woman no credit for her new simplicity, but put down the deficiency to the charge of domestic slatternliness. She was unjust enough to declare afterwards that she had found Arabella French only half dressed at between three and four o'clock in the afternoon! From which this lesson may surely be learned,--that though the way down Avernus may be, and customarily is, made with great celerity, the return journey, if made at all, must be made slowly. A young woman may commence in <b>chignons</b> by attaching any amount of an edifice to her head; but the reduction should be made by degrees. Arabella's edifice had, in Miss Stanbury's eyes, been the ugliest thing in art that she had known; but, now, its absence offended her, and she most untruly declared that she had come upon the young woman {{in the middle of the}} day just out of her bed-room and almost in her dressing-gown.|$|R
60|$|As for {{the section}} {{conventionally}} called 'fair,' and unpolitely termed by Cato the 'chattering, finery-loving, ungovernable sex,' I despair to depict it. When returning {{north in the}} A.S.S. Winnebah, we carried on board a dark novice of the Lyons sisterhood. She looked perfectly ladylike in her long black dress and the white wimple which bound her hair under the sable mantilla. But the feminines on board the Senegal bound for Sierra Leone outrage all our sense of fitness by their frightful semi-European gowns of striped cottons and chintzes; by their harlequin shawls and scarves thrown over jackets which show more than neck and bare arms to the light of day, and by the head-gear which looks like devils seen in dreams after a heavy supper of underdone pork. Africa lurks in the basis: the harsh and wiry hair is gathered into lumps, which to the new comer suggest only bears' ears, and into <b>chignons</b> resembling curled up hedge-hogs. Around it is twisted a kerchief of arsenic-green, of sanguineous-crimson, or of sulphur-yellow; {{and this would be}} unobjectionable if it covered the whole head, like the turban of the Mina negress in Brazilian Bahia. But it must be capped with a hat or bonnet of straw, velvet, satin, or other stuff, shabby in the extreme, and profusely adorned with old and tattered ribbons and feathers, with beads and bugles, with flowers and fruits. The tout ensemble would scare any crow, however bold.|$|R
6000|$|The coiffure of the <Greek> [...] is {{peculiar}} {{and elaborate}} {{as that of}} the Gold Coast. These ladies seem to have chosen for their model the touraco or cockatoo,--they have never heard of [...] "Kikeriki,"--and the effect is at first wondrously grotesque. Presently the eye learns to admire pretty Fanny's ways; perhaps the pleureuse, the old English corkscrew ringlet, might strike the stranger as equally natural in a spaniel, and unnatural in a human. Still a style so peculiar requires a toilette in keeping; the [...] "king" [...] in uniform is less ridiculous than the Gaboon lady's <b>chignon,</b> contrasting with a tight-bodied and narrow-skirted gown of pink calico.|$|E
6000|$|In {{a moment}} the doubt was gone. She was enchanting. Quite a {{different}} style of dress, but equally lovely and suitable. A long figured gown of some fine woollen material, giving very nearly {{the effect of a}} plain neat print, and made quite simply to fit her perfect little figure. A plain linen collar, and a quiet silver brooch. Hair tied in a single broad knot above the head, instead of yesterday's <b>chignon</b> and cheese-plate. Altogether, a model winter morning costume for a cold climate. And as she advanced frankly, holding out her hand with a smile, I could have cut my own throat with a pocket-knife as a merited punishment for daring to distrust her. Such is human nature at the ripe age of twenty! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And why shouldn't he {{deny them}} when there wasn't {{a word of}} truth in them?" [...] {{continued}} Camilla. [...] "For my part I think the gentleman is bound for the lady's sake to declare that there's nothing in it when {{there is nothing in}} it." [...] This was more than Miss Stanbury could bear. Hitherto the enemy had seemed to have the best of it. Camilla was firing broadside after broadside, as though she was assured of victory. Even Mrs. French was becoming courageous; and Arabella was forgetting the place where her <b>chignon</b> ought to have been. [...] "I really do not know what else there is for me to say," [...] remarked Camilla, with a toss of her head, and an air of impudence that almost drove poor Miss Stanbury frantic.|$|E
6000|$|When {{you have}} ceased looking--even staring--at the {{black women and}} their ways, you {{become aware of the}} strange variety of races which people the city. Here passes an old Coolie Hindoo, with nothing on but his lungee round his loins, and a scarf over his head; a white- bearded, delicate-featured old gentleman, with {{probably}} some caste- mark of red paint on his forehead; his thin limbs, and small hands and feet, contrasting strangely with the brawny Negroes round. [...] There comes a bright-eyed young lady, probably his daughter-in-law, hung all over with bangles, in a white muslin petticoat, crimson cotton-velvet jacket, and green gauze veil, with her naked brown baby astride on her hip: a clever, smiling, delicate little woman, who is quite aware of the brightness of her own eyes. And who are these three boys in dark blue coatees and trousers, one of whom carries, hanging at one end of a long bamboo, a couple of sweet potatoes; at the other, possibly, a pebble to balance them? As they approach, their doleful visage betrays them. Chinese they are, without a doubt: but whether old or young, men or women, you cannot tell, till the initiated point out that the women have <b>chignons</b> and no hats, the men hats with their pigtails coiled up under them. [...] Beyond this distinction, I know none visible. Certainly none in those sad visages--'Offas, non facies,' as old Ammianus Marcellinus has it.|$|R
6000|$|The immensity {{was quite}} as {{striking}} {{to the mind}} as to the eye, and an absolute democracy was appreciable in it. Not only did all artificial distinctions cease, but those of nature were practically obliterated, and you felt for once the full meaning of unanimity. No one was at a disadvantage; one was as wise, as good, as handsome as another. In most public assemblages, the foolish eye roves {{in search of the}} vanity of female beauty, and rests upon some lovely visage, or pretty figure; but here it seemed to matter nothing whether ladies were well or ill-looking; and one might have been perfectly ascetic without self-denial. A blue eye or a black,--what of it? A mass of blonde or chestnut hair, this sort of walking-dress or that,--you might note the difference casually in a few hundred around you; but a sense of those myriads of other eyes and <b>chignons</b> and walking-dresses absorbed the impression in an instant, and left a dim, strange sense of loss, as if all women had suddenly become Woman. For the time, one would have been preposterously conceited to have felt his littleness in that crowd; you never thought of yourself in an individual capacity at all. It was as if you were a private in an army, or a very ordinary billow of the sea, feeling the battle or the storm, in a collective sort of way, but unable to distinguish your sensations from those of the mass. If a rafter had fallen and crushed you and your unimportant row of people, you could scarcely have regarded it as a personal calamity, but might have found it disagreeable as a shock to that great body of humanity. Recall, then, how astonished you were to be recognized by some one, and to have your hand shaken in your individual character of Smith. [...] "Smith? My dear What's-your-name, I am for the present the fifty-thousandth part of an enormous emotion!" ...|$|R
6000|$|In the meantime, {{there was}} an uncomfortable scene in {{progress}} between Dorothy and her aunt. Brooke Burgess, as desired, had left the house before eleven, having taken upon himself, when consulted, {{to say in the}} mildest terms, that he thought that, in general, young women should not be asked to marry if they did not like to;--which opinion had been so galling to Miss Stanbury that she had declared that he had so scolded her, that she did not know whether she was standing on her head or her heels. As soon as Mr. Gibson left her, she sat herself down, and fairly cried. She had ardently desired this thing, and had allowed herself to think of her desire as of one that would certainly be accomplished. Dorothy would have been so happy as the wife of a clergyman! Miss Stanbury's standard for men and women was not high. She did not expect others to be as self-sacrificing, as charitable, and as good as herself. It was not that she gave to herself credit for such virtues; but she thought of herself as one who, from the peculiar circumstances of life, was bound to do much for others. There was no end to her doing good for others,--if only the others would allow themselves to be governed by her. She did not think that Mr. Gibson was a great divine; but she perceived that he was a clergyman, living decently,--of that secret pipe Miss Stanbury knew nothing,--doing his duty punctually, and, as she thought, very much in want of a wife. Then there was her niece, Dolly,--soft, pretty, feminine, without a shilling, and much in want of some one to comfort and take care of her. What could be better than such a marriage! And the overthrow to the girls with the big <b>chignons</b> would be so complete! She had set her mind upon it, and now Dorothy said that it couldn't, and it wouldn't, and it shouldn't be accomplished! She was to be thrown over by this chit of a girl, as she had been thrown over by the girl's brother! And, when she complained, the girl simply offered to go away! ...|$|R
