The research explores how firms should frame their crossborder physical flows of goods and the configuration of their value-adding processes for taking advantage of diagonal <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The empirical analysis is based on an in-depth case study of effects of the ‘SAP+ diagonal cumulation of origin’ on changes in the transaction cost structure of a selected Slovenian firm operating within the household-appliance sector in one of the Western Balkan Countries. Based on eligibility of local subsidiary for using origin of goods in its import/export transactions the cost calculations were made for its products and then three different business scenarios were developed for showing the effects of the mechanism on transaction cost changes of a firm. The paper concludes that, at the conceptual level, the mechanism of diagonal cumulation oforigin may serve as an effective institutional cross-border trade-promoting too...|$|E

According to evidence provided by several papers (Cornejo and Harris, 2007; Gasiorek, 2007; and Estavadeordal and Suominem, 2008), we estimate that taking measures for adding leniency to RoO structures will make it more attractive for regional firms to import from within the region. Finally, more flexible rules of origin will make the region more attractive to foreign investors and, as a consequence, will foster investment flows from abroad. We consider that South American countries have now an opportunity to define a strategy for cumulating origin norms among them. Therefore, it is necessary to negotiate the implementation of a single RoO regime for the region.

40|$|Within any {{preferential}} trade agreement (PTA) origin rules exist {{in order to prevent}} third countries from taking advantage of the PTA concessions. The rules thus are there to preserve the existing external protection of countries within the PTA. However, depending on their formulation, they can also increase that level of external protection, resulting in trade suppression and trade diversion. This paper provides the first serious empirical examination of the possible impact <b>of</b> rules <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> on patterns <b>of</b> trade in the European context. The methodology employed is that of an augmented gravity model where we focus on the impact within the Pan-european system <b>of</b> <b>cumulation.</b> The results suggest that rules <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> do indeed restrict trade, that the <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> such rules could increase trade in the order of 50 %, and that the impact is greater on intermediate than manufacturing trade. international trade, rules <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> gravity model...|$|R

40|$|In the {{emerging}} process of market globalisation, firms’ strategic options for optimising their cross-border operations have broadened. This paper presents a strategic framework for developing an appropriate strategic response of firms by relocating their production facilities and framing their operational procedures {{in such a}} way that they may, as eligible beneficiaries, exploit institutional incentive mechanisms available in a specific region or a host country. More specifically, in the paper we explore a strategic option for lowering firms’ operational costs through international operations by using the mechanism of diagonal <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> introduced by the European Union (EU) in its Common Commercial Policy towards selected non-member countries. Despite extensive discussions in theoretical literature on the conception of the rules of origin, only a few studies have explored the implications of this mechanism from the perspective of a firm’s transaction costs in international business. This paper shows that the ‘SAP+ diagonal cumulation of origin,’ when properly conceived and implemented by a firm, can positively affect its financial performance. By analysing the cost-effect simulation of a selected household appliance producer in the presented case study, we then discuss the key strategic and operational implications for firms wishing to take advantage of offered supranational institutional incentive mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|This is an {{empirical}} paper seeking {{to identify the}} mode of Turkey's integration into global markets in general, and pan-European markets in particular, as revealed in its trade performance. The analysis provides empirical support to the following observations. First, thanks to steady expansion of trade in goods and services since the mid- 1980 s, Turkey has become highly integrated into the world economy. Second, Turkey's export performance in 1996 - 2004 in EU markets bears strong similaritiesto the aggregate performance of new EU members from Central Europe (EU- 8). Similarities include dynamics, similar factors responsible for the increased presence in EU markets, factor content, and the role of"producer-driven"network trade. Turkey, together with Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, and Poland, stands {{as one of the}} top performers in"producer-driven"network trade indicating participation in a new global division of labor based on production fragmentation. The available evidence suggests an economic success story in the making. Export expansion owes a lot to improved policy environment and domestic liberalization. It is rather telling that the recent expansion has coincided with the implementation of most of the provisions of the EU-Turkey Customs Union Agreement, the completion of the removal of tariffs on trade in industrial products among pan-European parties to the Pan European <b>Cumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> Agreement, and improved macroeconomic stability after the 2001 crisis.

40|$|The {{entry into}} force of the Additional Protocol of the Framework Agreement of the Pacific Alliance in May 2016 marked an {{important}} step towards the regional integration efforts of its four members: Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. In addition to promoting trade and investment linkages among its members, a core objective of the Pacific Alliance —and what distinguishes it from other regional integration efforts in Latin America— is {{to serve as a}} platform for economic and commercial integration between Latin America and Asia-Pacific. It is, therefore, of particular interest to evaluate current economic developments taking part in modern Latin America and their impact upon these integration efforts. The data of bilateral flows of trade in goods at the product and sector level, together with the study of trade in services as well as foreign direct investment, reflect the strong links within the Pacific Alliance. It also reveals the potential to further increase its members’ participation in regional and global value chains. The Additional Protocol will serve not only to immediately eliminate tariffs for nearly 95 % of intraregional imports, but also to foster economic integration through <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and trade facilitation. The Pacific Alliance faces several challenges in the medium-term. First, it must successfully incorporate Costa Rica as a full member, the first accession since the Pacific Alliance was formed. Further, it must clearly define how to fulfill one of its driving forces: to serve as a bridge between Asian and Latin American countries {{on both sides of the}} Pacific. Abstract.

Based upon this rationale, it is less likely that initial mediation attempts succeed, but-after a turning point has been reached-subsequent mediations {{are more likely to}} induce an effective resolution of a dispute.
