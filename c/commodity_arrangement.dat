The paper examines general implications of obligatory stockpiling and discusses potential methods of financing obligatory Swiss commodity stockpiles. Economic arguments question the desireability of obligatory stockpiles. The decision as to the appropriate mode of financing obligatory stockpiles is basically a political one which should take regard of the economic implications behind the chosen financial arrangement. ...|$|R

The major causes included changed macro and micro economic policies, changes to national marketing arrangements, reduced producer support for compulsory delivery, producer interest in individual ownership of CMB assets, and producer demands for more flexible marketing systems. The key role of the Queensland Government in encouraging reviews of the CMBs, providing innovative and flexible legislative changes, and providing information and other assistance, is emphasised. Research on the effects of the changes in the <b>commodity</b> marketing <b>arrangements</b> is suggested. Marketing,...|$|R
40|$|The cotton boom in Burkina Faso {{consisted}} of a growth in cotton land shares together with an overall increase in total cultivated land. This paper examines the impact of institutional changes in the cotton sector {{on the evolution of}} smallholders’ land-use decisions. The empirical analysis is supported by a structural model that takes into account the specific institutional features of the Burkinabè cotton sector and builds upon household level data collected in rural Burkina Faso. We attribute most of the change in land use to the newly established institutional arrangements between producers and stakeholders, mechanization, and slackening of the food security constraint.

The Corporation has gone through substantial change in its role from Barter to <b>Commodity</b> Exchange <b>Arrangement</b> and to cash trade in line with free market economy approach adopted by the Government of Pakistan. It has remained engaged mainly in commodities trade with a modest beginning of trade of Rs. 115.763 million in 1967-68 and has registered turn over of Rs. 45,161.248 million in 2009-10. TCP’s current role of import of essential commodities is for improving supplies to ensure availability of commodities to consumers at affordable prices and market intervention for ensuring fair price to farmers. TCP being government organization, strictly follows Public Procurement Rules, 2004 to ensure transparency in all its procurement and has been focusing on decartelisation in all business activities like stevedoring, transportation, clearing and survey. Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has recently appreciated TCP’s positive role played in this regard. TCP’s corporate strategy reflects the commitment to sustainable business practices balanced by the demanding responsibilities assigned as per charter. Fiscal year 2009-10 remained a challenging year {{in the global economy}} as the international commodity market witnessed serious volatility in international commodity market prices. The international commodity market not only witnessed widespread economic recession but also experienced distressed supply line and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.|$|R

40|$|Smallholder {{farmers in}} South Africa have {{historically}} been precluded from the mainstream agricultural markets owing to various factors, chiefly, a non-existent enabling environment and lack {{of support from the}} government and/or relevant agencies. The post- 1994 changes in the economy, and in particular in the agricultural industry, brought about the phenomenon of preferential procurement and contractual arrangements in agricultural value chains. Most agribusinesses and supermarkets in South Africa procure agricultural products under contractual arrangements. Recent studies and literature indicate that contractual arrangements are considered an ideal institutional arrangement for fostering market access for smallholder farmers. However, there has not been growth in incidences of sustained contractual arrangements between agribusiness, supermarkets and smallholder farmers in South Africa. Owing to this, it is imperative to investigate the nature of existing contractual arrangements, their salient aspects and the types of smallholder farmers actively participating in certain arrangements. This study aims at investigating the types of contractual arrangements in which certain smallholder farmers are engaged and analysing characteristics of these farmers. Furthermore, trajectories of smallholder farmers who participate in contractual arrangements were analysed in order to establish factors that enable their involvement. Contractual arrangements were categorised according to the general outline, contract conditions, roles of contractors and farmers, conflict resolution, and the advantages and disadvantages that arise from these arrangements. The study employed a geographic approach and focused on smallholder farmers and agribusinesses in the Tzaneen area. A total of 36 farmers and 4 agribusinesses were interviewed during the survey. The study employed both structured and semi-structured questionnaires for farmers and agribusinesses, respectively. In addition to farmers and agribusinesses, representatives from the Department of Agriculture and the Land Bank were consulted in order to corroborate responses from farmers and agribusinesses. In order to make suitable inferences, relevant literature on contract farming and smallholder farmers was explored. This helped to better understand various contractual arrangements, participation of smallholder farmers, and the most feasible ways in which contractual arrangements can be employed as tool for inclusion of smallholder farmers in agricultural markets. The results of this study indicated that agribusinesses prefer to initiate contractual arrangements with smallholder farmers that have access to land and certain production infrastructure. There is a positive relationship between farmers’ ownership or access to land and suitable infrastructure and their involvement in contractual arrangements. It should be noted that ownership of equipment and other machinery on the part of smallholder farmers did not {{have a major impact on}} their likelihood of participating in contractual arrangements. Smallholder farmers were drawn to most contractual arrangements for many reasons, including market reliability and guaranteed payment following deliveries of produce. Although smallholder farmers who participated in contractual arrangements earned considerably high revenues from disposal of their produce through the contractors’ channels, there were cases of late payments and reduced expected incomes. In the broiler chicken management contractual arrangement, a number of the participating smallholder farmers indicated that the contractor, Bushvalley, did not always pay within the agreed 30 -day period and in some instances, the grading and subsequent pricing of their broiler birds was ‘deliberately’ stringent, thereby lowering prices and revenues. Producer prices for <b>commodities</b> in contractual <b>arrangements</b> varied, and in most cases were lower than spot market prices that could be fetched by the commodities of similar quality in the local market and elsewhere. However, it is important to note that farmers were satisfied by the fact that producer prices in contractual arrangements remained constant and stable within a production season or period, thereby allowing them to plan the financial management of their farming businesses. This study established that although there are various factors that determine successful participation of smallholder, external support in various forms from both the government, private and non-governmental organisations was crucial in enabling contractual arrangements. In cases where external support was provided, smallholder farmers entered into and participated in contractual arrangements without difficulties. Thus, this study suggests that relevant external support is an important form of intervention for fostering contractual arrangements and thereby helping smallholder farmers to access agricultural markets. This study further recommends that the government should play in important role in providing an enabling environment through deliberate policies and regulations that foster contractual arrangements and enable smallholder farmers in various sectors to access suitable agricultural markets.
