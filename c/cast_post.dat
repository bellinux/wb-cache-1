40|$|Introduction: The main factor {{involved}} in the failure of endodontically treated teeth is crown reconstruction rather than root canal treatment itself. The present study compared stress distribution in pre-fabricated and cast post-and-cores by finite element analysis. In addition, the effect of post material was evaluated. Method and materials: In this cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study, an extracted sound human mandibular second molar was embedded in an acrylic resin cylindrical mold. Axial cross-sections were prepared by abrasion and photographed; the images were transferred into a computer software program and a three-dimensional solid model of the tooth was prepared. A load of 10. 43 MPa was applied on a 23 -mm 2 surface area of the occlusal surface at an angle of 45 °. Finally, different restoration models for pre-fabricated and <b>cast</b> <b>posts</b> were designed {{and the effect of}} post material was analyzed. Results: <b>Cast</b> <b>posts</b> generated less stresses compared to pre-fabricated posts; however, pre-fabricated posts were more conservative form the stress location viewpoint. Regarding stress concentration, gold posts were more favorable in comparison to titanium posts because stress concentration in gold posts takes place in the cervical region, so that if root failure occurs, reconstruction is possible. Conclusion: <b>Cast</b> <b>posts</b> result in less stress in roots compared to pre-fabricated posts. Except for gold <b>cast</b> <b>posts,</b> all other <b>cast</b> <b>posts</b> are more dangerous in relation to stress distribution.

A pull-out bond strength evaluation was performed using a universal testing machine. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to prove normal distribution.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Many {{studies have}} been {{performed}} to evaluate the stress distribution around endodontic posts; those which compared posts composed of different materials are rare. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare stresses induced in dentin by three structurally different posts using photoelasticity method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine blocks of PSM- 5 Photoelastic material with 45 × 45 × 10 mm dimension were prepared. In each block, a canal 9 mm in length and 0. 8 mm in width was drilled. Blocks were divided into 3 groups of three each. In the first group, the canals were prepared for insertion of Fiber Post with 1. 25 mm width. In the second group, the canals were prepared for insertion of ParaPost with 1. 25 mm width and the canals in the third group were prepared for <b>casting</b> <b>post</b> similar to the above samples. <b>Casting</b> <b>Post</b> pattern was made by Duralay resin and casted by Ni-Cr alloy. All posts were cemented in canals with Panavia cement. The stresses were evaluated in the polariscope under three different conditions: 1) without load, 2) with 135 N vertical load, and 3) with 90 N oblique load (26 ° inclination to post long axis). The fringe orders in the cervical, middle and apical regions of the posts were evaluated and compared with each other. RESULTS: Application of the vertical load induced a high stress concentration (FO= 4) in the apical region of the ParaPost, while lower stress was observed in the middle (FO= 2) and cervical region (FO= 2 +). Fiber <b>Post</b> and <b>Casting</b> <b>Post</b> showed even stress distribution (FO= 2 +). High stress concentration was detected with the application of oblique force in the cervical region of ParaPost (FO= 5) and <b>Casting</b> <b>Post</b> (FO= 3 +).

40|$|Introduction: Dimensional {{changes in}} acrylic {{patterns}} during laboratory process to fabricate casting {{are an important}} issue {{which could lead to}} many clinical consequences. Microleakage, lack of retention and fitness are few of problems which could be predicted in the case of dimensional changes in acrylic patterns. So, investigating the factors which could minimize the dimensional change is necessary. This study compares how different proportions of silica-sol and distilled water affect the dimensional changes in castings. Methods: This study was an experimental study wherein 30 specimens of acrylic patterns (Duralay) with similar dimensions were prepared and equally divided in five different groups and studied. Using extensiometer digital machine, the acrylic patterns were measured at three portions (length, coronal diameter and apical diameter) with accuracy of 10 microns. Results: 1 - The mean average of <b>casting</b> <b>post</b> length compared to changed acrylic patterns was statistically significant in pure distilled water group only. 2 - The mean average of changes in casting coronal diameter did not demonstrate any significant differences compared to acrylic patterns. 3 - The mean average of changes in <b>casting</b> <b>post</b> apical diameter compared to acrylic patterns using pure distilled water was significant. Conclusion: Because the least value in dimensional change was seen in ratio of silica-sol and distilled water, these ratios are recommended in fabrication of <b>casting</b> <b>posts</b> in order to have maximum accuracy and minimum micro leakage while building crowns and bridges...|$|R

Of the 101 patients who were recruited, 72 came for a follow-up examination. RESULTS Forty-one <b>cast</b> <b>posts</b> and cores and 31 composite cores were examined clinically and radiologically after an average observation period of 8. 56 (SD 1. 45) years. Four teeth were extracted during the observation period, and 2 more were extracted at the time of the examination. This resulted in cumulative survival rates of 90. 2 % for <b>cast</b> <b>posts</b> and cores and 93. 5 % for composite cores. There were 28 complications altogether, consisting of 2 (7. 1 %) root fractures, 8 (28. 6 %) teeth with increased probing depths, 3 (10. 7 %) with increased degrees of mobility, 4 (14. 3 %) with caries, 9 (32. 1 %) with periapical radiolucency and/or retrograde filling, and 2 (7. 1 %) with loss of retention.

All groups were prepared to receive all ceramic crowns. All samples were subjected to compressive testing with an Instron machine (Universal Testing Machine) and fracture loads and failure patterns were analyzed.

Materials and Methods: Sixty central incisor teeth were selected and grouped into six groups, viz. A, B, C, D, E, and F, each consisting of 10 specimens. Group A specimens were not subjected to any restorative treatment. Group B specimens were endodontically treated and crowned. Specimens of groups C and D were restored with custom <b>cast</b> <b>post</b> and core. Specimens of groups E and F were treated with prefabricated titanium post and composite core.

Despite the {{increasing use of}} prefabricated <b>posts,</b> <b>cast</b> metal <b>posts</b> and cores are still widely used. The quality of the latter is important for the longevity of restorative treatment, and failure can occur if the fundamental principles are not followed. Objective To radiographically evaluate the prosthetic principles of 1000 cast metal post-and-core restorations performed in single-rooted teeth and their coherence with the principles used for their confection. Material and method Digital periapical radiographs of 1000 endodontically treated, single-rooted teeth with <b>cast</b> metal <b>posts</b> and cores were selected from the collection of a radiology clinic (Centro de Imagem, Aracaju/SE, Brazil). The images were analyzed using a measurement software (ImageJ, USA) in accordance with the fundamental prosthetic principles: length and diameter of the post, ratio between post and bone crest, contiguity of post to the root canal, gap between post and the remaining root canal filling, amount of remaining root canal filling, and absence of periapical lesion. The data were qualitatively analyzed, classified into ideal and not ideal, and submitted to the chi-square test (α= 0. 05). Result Only 6. 7 % of the <b>cast</b> metal <b>posts</b> analyzed were satisfactorily fabricated. Conclusion Many prosthetic criteria are neglected during the manufacturing of <b>cast</b> metal <b>post</b> and cores, resulting in inadequate work that may compromise the longevity of restorative treatments...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of tooth wear {{has been a}} subject of increasing interest from both preventive and restorative points of view. This article describes the full mouth rehabilitation of a 54 -year-old bruxer woman with a severely worn dentition and other dental problems including unsuitable restorations and several missing teeth. The treatment entailed using <b>cast</b> <b>posts</b> and cores, metal-ceramic restorations, and a removable partial denture. As with the treatment procedure of such cases, equal-intensity centric occlusal contacts on all teeth and an anterior guidance in harmony with functional jaw movements were especially taken into account...|$|R
