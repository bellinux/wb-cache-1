5|$|While {{serving in}} Congress, Jennings's health {{continued}} to decline {{as he struggled}} with alcohol addiction and suffered from severe rheumatism. In 1827 <b>ceiling</b> <b>plaster</b> from Jennings's Washington D.C. boarding room fell on his head, severely injuring him, and ill health limited his ability to visit his constituents, but he continued to remain a popular politician in Indiana. In the congressional election of 1826, Jennings ran unopposed. He won reelection in 1828, soundly defeating his opponent, Indiana's lieutenant governor, John H. Thompson. Jennings did not publicly favor a presidential candidate and won the Second District seat with support from voters who favored Jackson and Adams. During Jennings's final term in office House journals show that he introduced no legislation, was frequently not present to vote on matters, and only once delivered a speech. Jennings's friends, led by Senator John Tipton, took note of his situation and took action to block Jennings's reelection bid when his drinking became a political liability. John Carr, anti-Jackson man, opposed Jennings in a six-way race for the congressional seat and won the election. Tipton had arranged for others to enter the race and divide Jennings's supporters. Jennings left office on March 3, 1831.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, 1981 and 1982, {{there were}} further repairs {{to the ceiling}} of the presbytery and {{staircase}} of the choir; substitution of the zinc flap edges and tile flooring. In 1980, the LNEC realized a study of the stone, for signs of degradation based on physical, chemical and petrographic assessments. These investigations were followed, in 1983, by conservation and cleaning of the facade, using hydraulic hoses to remove the dirt, accompanied by hard-bristle brushes and soft sponges. In 1984, the DGEMN, demolished and reconstructed the firewall with plaster and whitewash; chipping away the plaster facade and replacing it with new plaster of mortar, whitewashing the completed surface; repair and replacement of the pavement of the choir; replacement of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>plaster,</b> paint and window grills; varnishing the doors; substitution of glass; cracks and joints were grouted in the facade, with new stone replacing older rock, which was removed and replaced.|$|E
2500|$|Anna Brun noticed Marie taking {{white powder}} from her {{malachite}} box and stirring {{it into the}} eggnog. When asked, Marie said it was [...] "orange-blossom sugar". But Anna's suspicions were aroused when she noticed a few white flakes floating {{on the surface of}} the eggnog after the patient took a few sips. She showed the glass to Dr. Massénat; he tasted the eggnog and experienced a burning sensation, but attributed the flakes to some <b>ceiling</b> <b>plaster</b> that may have fallen in the glass. Anna was not convinced; she put the rest of the eggnog in a cupboard and kept a close eye on Marie. She saw Marie stir more white powder into some soup for Charles. Again, Charles felt violently ill after a few sips. Anna took the cup of soup away and mustered enough courage to tell Charles's relatives of her suspicions.|$|E
50|$|In street frontage, {{internal}} organisation {{and interior}} ornamentation, {{the building is}} typical of hotels erected in Warwick during the early 20th century.

50|$|Friendship {{experienced}} {{something of}} a second birth in the late 1980s. Urban homesteaders began to move into Friendship, looking past the blight to see an opportunity to buy large homes with features—high <b>ceilings,</b> <b>plaster</b> walls, stained-glass windows, and ornate woodwork—that were not available in newer suburban homes.|$|R

The interior walls are painted or plastered brick, with plain <b>plastered</b> <b>ceilings</b> and concrete floors (some with vinyl and carpet floor coverings). Suspended <b>ceilings</b> conceal <b>plaster</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The church {{contains}} several memorials, {{including one}} to the 17th-century politician Charles Montagu. The explorer James Cook married in the church on 21 December 1762. Ten years later the nave, chancel and sanctuary all had their <b>ceilings</b> <b>plastered,</b> though this {{was removed from the}} nave ceiling in 1842. The building was grade I listed in 1954. An extension was added along the south side late in the 20th century to provide an office, bookshop and refectory.|$|R
50|$|The hotel’s primary public rooms {{include the}} lobby, ballroom and main {{dining room and}} as of March 2016, have survived largely intact. They feature {{elaborate}} <b>ceiling</b> <b>plaster</b> moldings and columns, gilded capitals, faux limestone walls, oak and emerald terrazzo floors.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} was constructed with plaster walls and timber boarded <b>ceilings</b> with <b>plaster</b> <b>ceiling</b> roses, {{many of which}} survive without light fittings. A suspended grid ceiling {{has been added to}} the ground floor and services, including lighting and air conditioning are ducted in the cavity formed between the original and the new ceiling. Individual air conditioning units have been inserted above the openings in many of the first floor rooms.|$|R
50|$|Paneled {{double doors}} at the east end lead into the parlor, the largest room in the house. Molded {{baseboard}} runs around the entire room. The windows are complemented by panels in the wall below and a two-inch (5 cm) wooden drapery rod with acorn finials above. In the <b>ceiling</b> <b>plaster</b> is a molded cornice and two friezes, with a sunflower surrounded by other floral motifs at the center.|$|E
50|$|Inside {{the main}} entrance, a paired Dutch door with {{original}} hardware, {{is a large}} main room with a smaller kitchen and dining room. The main room has beaded chair rail and baseboard and windows with original camlocks. Two original paneled doors with thumb latches lead into the other rooms. All are finished with the original 7 to 9 in tongue and groove pine flooring and wall and <b>ceiling</b> <b>plaster.</b> The dining room floor has a tin strip patch.|$|E
50|$|In {{connection}} with a collapse of <b>ceiling</b> <b>plaster</b> in 1976 (requiring a renovation), the collective of educators and students were temporarily moved to another building on the 13th line (no. 28). The renovation was not completed {{due to lack of}} funds, and school activities were not reinstated in the old building. All the unique classroom equipment, the furniture, memorial plaques with the names of former graduates of various years, busts of writers and scholars, and the decorated interiors were left to the whims of fate. All of it was quickly plundered and irretrievably lost.|$|E

50|$|Hotel Caruso {{was built}} with four {{different}} types of vault: barrel, cross, sail and pavilion. The larger rooms with sail vaults are also frescoed with typical 18th-century motifs. The vaults were built either in stone or using a local technique known as ‘beaten lapillus’: dry branches were laid {{on top of the}} walls in the desired shape of the vault, and then covered with wet soil. On this base, a paste of lapillus (tiny stones) was applied and beaten down until a compact shape was created. Then the branches were removed, and the <b>ceiling</b> <b>plastered,</b> ready either for frescoing or whitewashing.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, the Smithsonian {{revealed}} the Old Patent Office Building was in serious disrepair. The roof leaked, netting {{had to be}} placed in some galleries to catch falling <b>ceiling</b> <b>plaster,</b> window frames were rotting, the floor tiles in the Great Hall were crumbling, and the exterior facade was so degraded it was shedding fist-sized pieces of rock. The Smithsonian announced the building would close in January 2000 for a two-year, $42 million renovation. Hartman-Cox Architects was hired to oversee the conservation and repair. The cost of the renovation was pegged at $110 million to $120 million.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ceiling</b> <b>plaster</b> {{was applied}} in one {{continuous}} operation by recruiting a large team of plasterers from miles around, who worked {{around the clock}} standing on cedar pole scaffolding, to obtain a seamless sky before the plaster {{had a chance to}} dry. Much of the artwork was rendered not in paint but in wet coloured plaster, according to the traditional fresco method. In the trade, these theatres were sometimes called [...] "soft tops" [...] since the illusion was of no ceiling—of being out of doors. Stencils on the proscenium arch are original, as are the wall lanterns.|$|E
50|$|In 1934 Woodford {{created a}} monumental pair of doors for the {{headquarters}} of the Royal Institute of British Architects at 66 Portland Place, London. They each weigh one-and-a-half tons, the deep relief designs showing the River Thames and various London buildings. He also made figures on the exterior columns, interior <b>ceiling</b> <b>plaster</b> reliefs depicting the main periods of English architecture and various building trades and crafts, and stone window-pieces depicting building through the ages. Four years later he made a set of 18 sculptured roundels for the six bronze doors of Norwich City Hall, each depicting a manual trade that had been practised in the city.|$|E
50|$|In 1918 Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney {{commissioned}} Chanler {{to create}} a set of seven stained glass windows for her sculpture studio on MacDougal Alley in Greenwich Village. She asked Chanler to decorate the entire space and {{over a period of}} five years, he created an immense chimney-piece of three-dimensional flames, floor to <b>ceiling,</b> in <b>plaster</b> with additional inserts of bronze blazes. He covered the entire <b>ceiling</b> with <b>plaster</b> constellations and then created the windows. Chanler also designed murals for Gertrude's studio in Greenvale, New York, including a seaworld fantasy in the bathroom. The studio is extant and privately owned.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} {{has important}} features.

50|$|Since the Temple {{was rescued}} from {{demolition}} by the York Pioneer and Historical Society in 1917, {{the building has}} undergone periodic restoration work but without significant structural intervention. The Ontario Heritage Foundation funded extensive restoration of the exterior in 1995 and currently holds a conservation easement on this and other buildings on the site. Further extensive work was accomplished with an Infrastructure Stimulus Fund grant. The most recent work includes: restoration of a wood shingle roof, exterior painting, full reglazing of Temple windows (1993); partial restoration of the Arc, replacement of the gold globe (1996); remedial repair to the floors (1998); restoration and painting of the Temple doors (2001); repainting ground floor windows (2003); <b>ceiling</b> <b>plaster</b> repairs on interior of Temple (2005); foundation repairs, installation of fire detection system (2011).|$|E
