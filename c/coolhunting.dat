50|$|Rather than {{outsourcing}} {{their market}} research, some companies opt for in-house youth culture marketing divisions. These divisions act {{in much the}} same way as a <b>coolhunting</b> firm but the reports and data collected remain within the company and are used solely to promote its products. A company will often prefer this form of <b>coolhunting</b> as a way to gain an advantage in the valuable youth market since the research conducted by <b>coolhunting</b> firms is available to anyone willing to pay for it. Viacom's MTV television network employs in-house <b>coolhunting.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Coolhunting</b> is a {{neologism}} coined in {{the early}} 1990s referring to {{a new kind of}} marketing professionals who make observations and predictions in changes of new or existing [...] "cool" [...] cultural fads and trends. <b>Coolhunting</b> is also referred to as [...] "trend spotting," [...] and is a subset of trend analysis.|$|E
50|$|A <b>coolhunting</b> firm is a {{marketing}} agency whose exclusive {{purpose is to}} conduct research of the youth demographic. They then compile their data and produce reports detailing emerging and declining trends in youth culture as well as predictions for future trends. These reports are then sold to various companies whose products target the youth demographic. They also offer consulting services. <b>Coolhunting</b> firms often provide services {{for some of the}} largest corporations in the world.|$|E

50|$|Coolhunters {{will often}} seek out {{individuals}} from within their target demographic who {{are regarded as}} leaders or trendsetters. They will then hire these individuals to be Cool Narcs, who gather information secretly among their peers and report their findings back to their employers. This is a popular method of <b>coolhunting</b> as it provides insight into their target demographic within their natural environment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Coolhunting</b> is {{more than}} simple market {{research}} {{because of the nature}} of the subjects. The teen and preteen market is often referred to as a [...] "stubborn" [...] demographic in that they do not respond as well to blatant advertising and marketing campaigns targeted at them. Coolhunters therefore must be more stealthy in their methods of gathering information and data.|$|E
50|$|This {{week the}} ten {{aspiring}} models get {{a visit from}} Stefano Fadda, a coolhunter. He explains that, for this weeks reward challenge, they must improvise themselves as photographers to do <b>coolhunting</b> in the centre of Milan, taking pictures of people who may anticipate certain fashion trends. Martina is exempt from the challenge, having injured her foot by slipping on the staircase when walking with wet feet. So the nine girls are split into groups of three and sent downtown to take snapshots. Diletta, Elena and Giorgia are declared winners and can spend an evening out in one of Milans coolest lounge bars.|$|E

40|$|Within {{the market}} {{research}} {{it has been}} developed, in recent years, a set of research techniques inspired by sociology and anthropology, known as <b>coolhunting</b> or trend research. The aim of <b>coolhunting</b> is to intercept and document emerging trends in consumers’ lifestyles, providing the enterprises with reports containing guidelines for planning future production and communication. Starting from an empirical investigation based on 43 in-depth interviews to the professionals engaged in trends prediction, together with a participant observation of the Dutch agency Science of the Time’s activities, the paper tries to identify: (1) the methodological features of <b>coolhunting</b> and its links to the non-standard social research; (2) the relationship between <b>coolhunting</b> and academic field: on the one hand, the benefits that <b>coolhunting</b> obtains from the academic research (especially the symbolic legitimation); on the other, its potential advantages for an employ in the explorative social research...|$|E

40|$|The {{transition}} from haute couture to prêt-à-porter in the 60 ’s has {{created in the}} fashion industry a great revolution both {{on the sides of}} production and consumption. One of the most relevant aspects in this process is the emergent demand of predicting future trends, in order to acquire a higher level of competitiveness compared to rivals. It is the birth of a structured activity known as fashion forecasting, managed by bureaux de style and embodied in trendbooks. Nowadays, this activity {{is often referred to as}} <b>coolhunting,</b> a striking term that implies an idea of research as intuitive ‘hunt’ of incipient signals in fashion and in consumers’ lifestyles. The chapter discusses <b>coolhunting,</b> a developing professional activity, as an emblematic place of symbolic mechanisms that are crucial in order to explain not only the fashion system but also many cultural processes of production and consumption of material goods rich in immaterial contents. The aim suggests that <b>coolhunting</b> is historically rooted in fashion forecasting, but it is also characterised by a relevant set of novelties, above all the shifting of research from a monolithic interest in fashion fads to socio-cultural trends that involve the whole symbolic imagination of the customer. A second important point is the extension of the fashion forecasting model to many branches of cultural production, more and more involved in a trend-oriented logic. Coolhunters emerge also as ‘messengers of distinction,’ the matching point between the consumers’ need of distinction and the producers’ attempt of creating distinctive goods...|$|E
40|$|Email, Instant Messaging, Voice Over IP (VOIP) {{and other}} means of online {{communication}} have become so ubiquitous today that we rarely {{take a moment to}} acknowledge how the internet has changed and redefined the ways in which we communicate and collaborate with fellow human beings. The internet has empowered us to collaborate with others in ways that were not possible till just a few years ago. As we communicate and interact with each other and form relationships, we weave intricate Social Networks that can be analyzed and exhibit communication patterns that can be quantified. In this thesis I have applied Social Network Analysis based techniques that constitute <b>Coolhunting</b> (Gloor & Cooper, 2007) to analyze E-Mail and WebEx communications of sales professionals of a large technology company. I have quantified communication patterns and computed metrics of social network prominence such as degree and betweenness centralities using Condor, a Social Network Analysis and <b>Coolhunting</b> software. Several significant correlations between the success of sales professionals and these quantified communication patterns and centrality measures were found. The communication patterns and centralities of the sales professionals exhibited several traits of Collaborative Innovation Networks or COINs (Gloor, 2006). I have assessed the implications of these communication patterns and correlations and applied the concept of Coolfarming (Gloor, 2011 a) to make recommendations to the technology company on how it could leverage the power of these COINs to their advantage.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{application of}} the trickle-up fashion effect for predicting new tendencies in architecture and building industry. To identify this phenomena an original method of analysis of World Wide Web was applied. The method {{is based on the}} <b>Coolhunting</b> methodology combined with the Internet query. The study allowed to draw conclusions on the diversification of new trends in functional, environmental and aesthetic aspects. This constitutes a significant problem for designers, developers, building materials producers and local authorities responsible for the spatial policy. Research on the prognostication of future trends in architecture makes important support for industry. Accurate forecasts concerning future trends activate the market, strengthen position of manufacturers of building materials, contractors and design studios. The methodology is an effect of conceptual work, research and analysis carried out by a research team at the Department of Architecture and Spatial Planning at Poznan University of Technology...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the identities}} of brands and {{consumers}} have been extensively explored, less is understood about the subjectivity of marketers themselves. In the ambiguous and dynamic exchange process of marketing, the articulation of identities is fundamental to demarcate the activities and actions that take place between market actors. In recent times, growing importance {{has been placed on}} a different breed of marketer in these exchanges - the cultural intermediary. For these marketing practitioners, knowledge about the interplay between culture and economy generates the cultural capital that legitimises their expertise and value. Yet, this simultaneously gives rise to the difficult navigation and accomplishment of boundaries between their work and pleasure. Through a case study of two <b>coolhunting</b> agencies, this paper examines how marketers discursively perform boundary work in the construction of their identities. The findings show that, for coolhunters, a tension exists in drawing on discourses of renegadism and professionalism to construct their identities, resulting in their engagement in chameleon-like identity work. The research proposes that the tensions pervading the construction of boundaries and identities for marketers can be usefully understood through a paradox lens, and offers the metaphor of the nomad as a theoretical representation of interwoven identity conflicts for marketers.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the Bourdieusian notion of {{cultural}} intermediaries and applies it to two open-ended professions {{of the field of}} fashion: the coolhunters and the fashion bloggers. <b>Coolhunting</b> is described as an evolution of the fashion forecasting model invented by the fashion industry in the late Sixties, aiming at collecting signals of socio-cultural trends and at finding new consumption paradigms, while blogging is presented as a subfield of the field of fashion media where young newcomers are gaining increasing popularity by challenging the rules of the printed media communication. The distinctive aspects that make bloggers and coolhunters as being cultural intermediaries are discussed by referring especially to the composition of their cultural capital (characterized by self-didacticism), the open-endedness of these jobs, and their role as producers of symbolic forms. Their function of junction points between production and consumption, and between mainstream and margins, is also analyzed. In conclusion, I argue that cultural intermediation is a positioning strategy in the neoliberal labor market, and not a mere adaptation to avoid the loss of social standing, and that conflict is a key concept to understand the work of the cultural intermediaries and their disruptive effect on the fields they belong to...|$|E
