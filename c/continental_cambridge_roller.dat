25|$|On tilled soil a {{one-piece}} roller has {{the disadvantage}} that when turning corners the outer {{end of the}} roller has to rotate much faster than the inner end, forcing one or both ends to skid. A one-piece roller turned on soft ground will skid up a heap of soil at the outer radius, leaving heaps, which is counter-productive. Rollers are often made {{in two or three}} sections to reduce this problem, and the <b>Cambridge</b> <b>roller</b> overcomes it altogether by mounting many small segments onto one axle so that they can each rotate at local ground-speed.|$|R

50|$|The Nehemiah Royce House, {{also known}} as the Washington Elm House, is a {{historic}} home located at 538 North Main Street, Wallingford, Connecticut. George Washington visited the house twice.

50|$|At {{the time}} of the Siege of Boston, the <b>Continental</b> Army at <b>Cambridge,</b> Massachusetts, in June 1775, is {{estimated}} to have numbered from 14-16,000 men from New England (though the actual number may have been as low as 11,000 because of desertions). Until Washington's arrival, it remained under the command of Artemas Ward, while John Thomas acted as executive officer and Richard Gridley commanded the artillery corps and was chief engineer.|$|R

KB Fund IV of California bought {{the building in}} 1997 and sold it to Modern <b>Continental</b> of <b>Cambridge,</b> Massachusetts in 2000. Raleigh Development bought the building in 2004, and McKinney & Silver soon left its 40000 sq ft to move to Durham. On November 2, 2005, Capital Bank announced plans to move to five floors in the building and rename it Capital Bank Center, putting the bank's name on top. The move gave downtown Raleigh its first bank headquarters since First Citizens moved to a suburban location 15 years earlier.|$|R

50|$|In 1775 George Washington put him {{in charge}} of a <b>Continental</b> {{regiment}} in <b>Cambridge</b> under the command of Brigadier General Benedict Arnold. Greene's regiment was part of Arnold's expedition through present-day Maine to attack the British garrison at Quebec. In the assault on that city on December 31, 1775, Greene led a detachment of troops, and, after Arnold was wounded, Greene was taken prisoner by the British. He was exchanged after eight months' confinement in August 1776. Greene was promoted to lieutenant colonel while he was a prisoner of war.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origins of}} the brand date back to 1933, when Harvard classmates Ernest Henderson and Robert Moore {{purchased}} the <b>Continental</b> Hotel in <b>Cambridge,</b> Massachusetts. In 1937, they purchased the Standard Investing Company and made it the company through which they ran their hotels. Their second hotel, and the first {{as part of the}} new company, was the Stonehaven Hotel in Springfield, Massachusetts, a converted apartment building they purchased in 1937. The chain got its name from a third hotel the pair acquired in Boston, which already had a large lighted sign on the roof saying [...] "Sheraton Hotel" [...] that was too expensive to change. Instead, Henderson and Moore decided to call all of their hotels by that name.|$|R
50|$|When the Second Continental Congress {{authorized}} {{an invasion}} of Quebec, {{in part on the}} urging of Arnold, he was passed over for leading the expedition. Arnold then went to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and suggested to George Washington a second expedition to attack Quebec City via a wilderness route through present-day Maine. This expedition, for which Arnold received a colonel's commission in the <b>Continental</b> Army, left <b>Cambridge</b> in September 1775 with 1,100 men. After a difficult passage in which 300 men turned back and another 200 died en route, Arnold arrived before Quebec City in November. Joined by Richard Montgomery's small army, he participated in the December 31 assault on Quebec City in which Montgomery was killed and he was wounded. Arnold, who was promoted to brigadier general for his role in reaching Quebec, maintained an ineffectual siege of the city until he was replaced by Major General David Wooster in April 1776.|$|R

40|$|The {{regulation}} of water {{regime in the}} soil {{is the most important}} task in semi-humid climate with not even precipitation distribution conditions. Reduced or minimum tillage may change soil hydrological properties. The objectives of this study were to investigate the possibilities to manage soil water regime during the whole soil tillage system for sugar beet, which are especially sensitive for water deficit or abundance. Five field experiments were carried out at the Ex-perimental Station of the Lithuanian University of Agriculture (Aleksandras Stulginskis University since 2011) (54 Ëš 52 'N, 23 Ëš 49 'E) during 1995 - 2010. The soil of the experiments was silty loam Luvisol. In this study we highlighted the reduction of primary soil tillage from deep annual soil ploughing to shallow ploughing, deep and shallow cultivation and no till, comparison of soil ploughing and subsoiling, presowing ploughed or unploughed soil tillage with different cultivatorsâ€”S-tine, complex, rotary and others, soil compressing with <b>Cambridge</b> and spur <b>rollers</b> before and after sugar beet sowing investigations. According to the results of experiments, reduction of primary soil tillage conserved soil water. The highest storage of soil water in spring was observed in non-reversibly tilled or not tilled soil. Subsoiling led higher water infiltration rate, and top layer of subsoiled soil consisted less moisture content than ploughed. Suga...|$|R
40|$|Piero Sraffa {{delivered}} {{a course of}} lectures on <b>Continental</b> banking to <b>Cambridge</b> undergraduates in the spring term of 1929 and 1930. He wrote extensive lecture notes, from which this paper reconstructs the structure and contents of the course. Sraffa emphasised {{the differences between the}} British and Continental, particularly German, banking systems, stressing the importance of the relations between banks and industry on the Continent. He also underlined the different roles played by central banks in the two systems. The lectures are particularly interesting for the light they throw on large German banks in the 1920 s and on the eve of their great crisis. The role of the allies in trying to reconstruct the German banking system after the defeat of Germany on lines which would weaken the banks' links with industry is brought into relief, as are the Allies' reduction of the Reichsbank's role as lender of last resort. Due attention is paid to the role of foreign capital in German banking in the 1920 s and to the crucial impact of the drying up of this resource {{at the end of the}} 1920 s. ...|$|R
