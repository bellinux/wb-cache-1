40|$|Spectral sensitivities {{of cells}} in {{principal}} {{eyes of the}} jumping spider Phidippus reqius were measured using techniques of intracellular recording. Three types of cells were found. UV cells had peak sensitivities at 370 nm and were over 4 log units less sensitive at wavelengths longer than 460 nm. Green-sensitive cells had spectral sensitivities which were well fit <b>by</b> <b>nomogram</b> curves peaking at 532 nm. UV-green cells had dual peaks of sensitivity at about 370 and 525 nm, but the ratios of UV-to-green sensitivities varied over a 40 : 1 range from cell to cell. Moreover, responses of UV-green cells to flashes of UV light were slower than to flashes of green light. Segregation of receptor types into the known layers of receptors in these eyes could not be shown. It is concluded that jumping spiders {{have the potential for}} dichromatic color vision...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{approximately}} 40 % of {{the breast}} cancer patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases, additional nodal metastases are detected in the completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND). The MSKCC nomogram can help to quantify a patient's individual risk for non-SLN metastases with fairly accurate predicted probability. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the predictions of surgical oncologists for non-SLN metastases with nomogram results and to clarify the impact of nomogram results on clinical decision-making. METHODS: Questionnaires, containing patient scenarios, were sent to surgical oncologists involved in breast cancer care. The surgeon was asked to predict the probability for non-SLN metastases for the first five scenarios. For the remaining scenarios, the patient's actuarial likelihood, calculated <b>by</b> the <b>nomogram,</b> was supplied. The surgeon was asked whether or not (s) he would perform a cALND. The type of hospital and the surgeon's experience were registered. RESULTS: The concordance-index amounted to 0. 78, indicating moderate concurrence between the surgical predictions and nomogram results. The intersurgeon variation was important. About 25 % of the surgeons was influenced <b>by</b> <b>nomogram</b> information and decided in one or more patients to abandon the cALND. Neither the type of hospital nor experience influenced predicting abilities or the clinical decision-making process. CONCLUSION: Individual predictions of surgical oncologists for non-SLN metastases do not correlate well with the MSKCC nomogram. The distribution between intersurgeon predictions for one scenario is important. Therefore, the nomogram is superior to clinical estimations for predicting the likelihood for non-SLN metastases...|$|R

40|$|The author {{introduces}} a decision method for facilitating physical planning and other decision processes at central government level, {{at the same}} time, taking into account some justified differences in local needs {{for the provision of}} urban facilities. The method considers the following factors influencing local needs: the number of urban inhabitants; the influence of larger cities (metropolises); and the number of inhabitants to be served in the hinterland of a city. The nationwide standard accepted for urban facilities is first differentiated according to city size, and for any specific city, i, it is further modified by the coefficient a iL, expressing the local deviations of the factors. The coefficient a iL is constructed from the ratios of 'real' local values of the factors to the 'a priori' values derived from a regular model of the settlement network in a larger territorial unit. The method is operationalised without any special technical aids, the 'a priori' values being tabulated or expressed <b>by</b> <b>nomograms.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{desirability}} of expressing biological measurements {{in terms of}} primary physical or chemical parameters has been stressed by others and in earlier publications by this group (1, 2). Translation of an instrumental reading into these more meaningful values necessitates calculations which are sometimes avoided by physicians and biologists. Such calculations can be eliminated <b>by</b> <b>nomograms</b> constructed {{on the basis of}} established techniques (3). The sound ness of this practice became apparent to us when appropriate nomograms made possible the reading of gravitational force from rpm (1), and of dose rate from microcuries (2). Estimations of the latter still require the calculation of disin tegrations per minute from the counts per minute given by a radiation measuring system. It was thought that elimination of this computation might not only facilitate dosimetric estimates, but might be useful also in the daily choices of the amounts of various radioisotopes necessary for specific investigations and tests. Since this nomogram was useful to some workers at this Center, it was thought that its publication might extend its utility to others...|$|R
