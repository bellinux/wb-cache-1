40|$|The {{material}} {{flow in the}} combined extrusion/forging process is an important phenomenon which controls the mechanical and metallurgical properties of any manufactured component. Collet <b>chuck</b> <b>holder</b> is a tool holding device used in different types of CNC milling machines. The <b>chuck</b> <b>holder</b> is described by a flange at the middle {{to fit into the}} machine, taper portion which is conical shaped area present at the bottom which enters the spindle for changing holder and collet pocket which fits the collet for holding the cutting tool. For manufacturing the tool holder an enormous amount of material is being wasted by the machining process which is almost equal to the volume of the product. Some manufacturer use casting, subsequently by machining to get the final shape. Both the used processes have their limitations as discussed earlier. To secure our material resources and to get better mechanical properties it is proposed to adopt the combined extrusion/forging and/or multi-stage processes for the production of different types of collet chuck holders. In general, it is found challenging to predict the metal flow by 3 D combined extrusion/forging process of complicated sections, collet <b>chuck</b> <b>holder</b> in particular, due to its complexity nature of analysis. From experiments it is observed that the complete process to get the first three components can be assumed to compose of four stages and fourth one of two stages with regard to forward/backward extrusion, forging, die corner filling, and flash formation. The mechanical, microscopic, micro hardness and residual stress analyses are performed for all the four components manufactured under different frictional conditions and ram velocities. The results confirm the advantage of the proposed processes to manufacture collet <b>chuck</b> <b>holder.</b> In the present investigation, upper bound method is used to analyze the combined extrusion/forging process of different types of collet chuck holders. A set of kinematically admissible velocity field is proposed to predict the metal flow pattern and the forging load. This work also employed 3 D finite element formulation to simulate the combined extrusion/forging process for axisymmetric collet chuck holders. The forming loads obtained by proposed upper bound technique is in good agreement with the numerical and experimental results and lies in the range of 0 - 15...|$|E

40|$|Combined {{extrusion}}-forging is a {{metal forming}} process where the billet is forced through the extrusion and forging dies {{to get the}} required product. Combined extrusion-forging processes are now getting importance because of improved mechanical properties, less capital cost, high production rate and less material waste when compared to conventional manufacturing processes like casting and machining. Combined extrusion-forging {{is used in the}} manufacturing {{of a wide range of}} engineering components. Due to the complexity of the forming process and because of so many process variables, it is difficult to predict the forming load required to manufacture a given component. The present research work emphasizes on the estimation of forming force for combined extrusion-forging process of Collet <b>chuck</b> <b>holder.</b> Experimental studies are carried out to compare the results obtained from the Finite element analysis simulation. Experiments are performed for Collet <b>chuck</b> <b>holder</b> using aluminum billet using required die sets in ambient temperature. Metal flow patterns and filling of die cavities has been studied in the experimental analysis. The modelling has been done by using 3 D modelling software Solid works and simulation through the finite element analysis. The results obtained from the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|E

To meet these challenges combined extrusion-forging process is employed to achieve improved material properties, high production rates, and less material wastage when compared with other manufacturing processes such as machining, casting, etc. Combined extrusion-forging process is the advanced metal forming process in which an initial billet is forced through the extrusion and forging die punch setup to get desired product. The flow pattern of metal mainly depends on the frictional conditions at the workpiece/die interface, the geometry of dies and the percentage area reductions. In this process, the estimation of forming load is a bit difficult {{because the number of}} process parameters involved, and complexness of analysis. It has extensive applications in automotive and aerospace industries. Present research work focuses on estimation of forming load to produce the product collet <b>chuck</b> <b>holder</b> by this process. The metal flow pattern and die cavity filling has studied in both experimental and simulation analysis. The modelling software Solidworks is used for 3 D modelling and Deform 3 DÂ® is used for the simulation process. The number of experiments has done to compare the results obtained from the simulation process. The results obtained from the experimentation and simulation analysis are in good agreement with each other...|$|E
50|$|Commercial CNC {{metalworking}} machines use {{closed loop}} feedback controls for axis movement. In a closed loop system, the control {{is aware of the}} actual position of the axis at all times. With proper control programming, this will reduce the possibility of a crash, but it is still up to the operator and programmer to ensure that the machine is operated in a safe manner. However, during the 2000s and 2010s, the software for machining simulation has been maturing rapidly, and it is no longer uncommon for the entire machine tool envelope (including all axes, spindles, <b>chucks,</b> turrets, tool <b>holders,</b> tailstocks, fixtures, clamps, and stock) to be modeled accurately with 3D solid models, which allows the simulation software to predict fairly accurately whether a cycle will involve a crash. Although such simulation is not new, its accuracy and market penetration are changing considerably because of computing advancements.|$|R
