50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was fuel starvation resulting from the captain's decision not to follow approved fuel crossfeed procedures. Different output pressure settings on the fuel boost pumps coupled with the open <b>crossfeed</b> <b>valve</b> resulted in both engines drawing fuel from the left tank. All of the fuel from the airplane's left tank that was not used by the engines was transferred into the right tank due to the pressure differential between the boost pumps. During the airplane's descent to landing, the fuel in the left fuel tank became exhausted. Both engine-driven fuel pumps drew air from the exhausted left tank into the fuel system, resulting in a dual-engine flameout.|$|E
40|$|To {{meet the}} goals for a next {{generation}} Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV), a unique propulsion feed system concept was identified using crossfeed between the booster and orbiter stages that {{could reduce the}} Two-Stage-to-Orbit (TSTO) vehicle weight and Design, Development, Test and Evaluation (DDT&E) costs by approximately 25 %, while increasing safety and reliability. The Main Propulsion System (MPS) crossfeed water demonstration test program addresses all activities required to reduce the risks for the MPS crossfeed system from a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 2 to 4 by the completion of testing and analysis by June 2003. During the initial period, that ended in March 2002, a subscale water flow test article was defined. Procurement of a subscale <b>crossfeed</b> check <b>valve</b> was initiated and the specifications for the various components were developed. The fluid transient and pressurization analytical models were developed separately and successfully integrated. The test matrix for the water flow test was developed to correlate the integrated model. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the <b>crossfeed</b> check <b>valve</b> was developed to assess flow disturbances and internal flow dynamics. Based on the results, the passive crossfeed system concept was very feasible and offered a safe system {{to be used in}} an RLV architecture. A water flow test article was designed to accommodate a wide range of flows simulating a number of different types of propellant systems. During the follow-on period, the crossfeed system model will be further refined, the test article will be completed, the water flow test will be performed, and finally the crossfeed system model will be correlated with the test data. This validated computer model will be used to predict the full-scale vehicle crossfeed system performance...|$|R
40|$|A {{pressurization}} system model {{was developed for}} a generic bimese Two-Stage-to-orbit Reusable Launch Vehicle using a cross-feed system and operating with densified propellants. The model {{was based on the}} {{pressurization system}} model for a crossfeed subscale water test article and was validated with test data obtained from the test article. The model consists of the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen pressurization models, each made up of two submodels, Booster and Orbiter tank pressurization models. The tanks are controlled within a 0. 2 -psi band and pressurized on the ground with ambient helium and autogenously in flight with gaseous oxygen and gaseous hydrogen. A 15 -psi pressure difference is maintained between the Booster and Orbiter tanks to ensure <b>crossfeed</b> check <b>valve</b> closure before Booster separation. The analysis uses an ascent trajectory generated for a generic bimese vehicle and a tank configuration based on the Space Shuttle External Tank. It determines the flow rates required to pressurize the tanks on the ground and in flight, and demonstrates the model's capability to analyze the pressurization system performance of a full-scale bimese vehicle with densified propellants...|$|R
