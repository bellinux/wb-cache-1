500|$|Around May 1951, Gravel {{saw that}} he was about to be drafted and instead enlisted in the U.S. Army for a three-year term so that he could get into the Counterintelligence Corps. After basic {{training}} and counterintelligence school at Fort Holabird in Maryland and in South Carolina, he went to Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia. While he expected to be sent off to the Korean War when he graduated as a second lieutenant in early 1952, he was instead assigned to Stuttgart, West Germany, as a [...] Special Adjutant in the Army's <b>Communications</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Service. There he had an adventurous time moving around the country, conducting surveillance operations on civilians, and paying off spies. After about a year he transferred to Orléans, France, where his French language abilities (if not his Quebec-American accent) allowed him to infiltrate French communist rallies. He worked as a Special Agent in the Counterintelligence Corps until 1954, eventually becoming a first lieutenant.|$|E
500|$|The tactics used in Operation Teardrop were {{evaluated}} by U.S.Navy officers after the war. The escort carriers' air wings were disappointed with their experience, as their ability to detect submarines was hampered by severe weather throughout the operation. Despite this, the aircraft were successful in forcing the U-boats to remain submerged, thereby greatly slowing their speed. [...] Other after action reports {{stressed the importance of}} teamwork between destroyer escorts when attacking submarines and argued that single barrier lines such as those used throughout most of Operation Teardrop were inferior to grouping ships in assigned patrol areas. [...] Nevertheless, Philip K. Lundeberg has assessed the operation as [...] "a classic demonstration not only of coordinated hunter tactics, derived in part from British experience, but also of the profound impact of <b>communications</b> <b>intelligence</b> in the interdiction of U-boat transit and operating areas." [...] Similarly, the British official history of the role intelligence played in World War II noted that information obtained from decrypted German radio transmissions contributed to [...] "virtually all" [...] of the sinkings during Operation Teardrop.|$|E
