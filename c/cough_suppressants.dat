25|$|Dextromethorphan (the {{stereoisomer}} of levomethorphan, a semi-synthetic opioid agonist) and its metabolite dextrorphan have no {{opioid analgesic}} effect at all despite their structural similarity to other opioids; instead they are potent NMDA antagonists and sigma 1 and 2-receptor agonists {{and are used}} in many over-the-counter <b>cough</b> <b>suppressants.</b>|$|E
25|$|NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists {{induce a}} state called dissociative anesthesia, marked by catalepsy, amnesia, and analgesia. Ketamine is a favored anesthetic for emergency patients with unknown medical history {{and in the}} treatment of burn victims because it depresses breathing and circulation less than other anesthetics. Dextrorphan, a metabolite of dextromethorphan (one of the most commonly used <b>cough</b> <b>suppressants</b> in the world), is known to be an NMDA receptor antagonist.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} in 1973 that a team at the National Institutes of Health in the United States had developed a method for total synthesis of morphine, codeine, and thebaine using coal tar as a starting material. A shortage in codeine-hydrocodone class <b>cough</b> <b>suppressants</b> (all {{of which can be}} made from morphine in one or more steps, as well as from codeine or thebaine) was the initial reason for the research.|$|E

Some recent placebo-controlled trials have found {{that it may be}} no better than a placebo for some causes including acute cough in children. Thus, it is not recommended for children. Additionally, {{there is no evidence that}} hydrocodone is useful in children. Similarly, a 2012 Dutch guideline regarding the treatment of acute cough does not recommend its use. (The opioid analogue dextromethorphan, long claimed to be as effective a cough suppressant as codeine, has similarly demonstrated little benefit in several recent studies.) ...|$|E
