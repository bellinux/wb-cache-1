Partnering with the DEA and U.S. EPA has allowed communities to collect these substances, especially “controlled substances,” which have specific requirements about their transfer and disposal. In addition, IISG's website [...] "How to Dispose of Unwanted Medicine & Personal Care Products" [...] provides information for communities and the public on proper disposal methods, events and drop-off locations, and how to start a collection event in their own area.|$|E
5000|$|The Arkansas State Plant Board (ASPB) is {{the lead}} agency for {{implementing}} the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) of 1996 (7 USC §136 et seq [...]). The ASPB has been monitoring groundwater since 2004 using an EPA-approved Pesticide Management Plan that allows the agency to work with ADH to determine {{actions to be taken}} in the event pesticide contamination is confirmed (Arkansas State Plant Board, 2013). ASPB also developed the Arkansas Agricultural Abandoned Pesticide Program as a way for farmers to safely and properly dispose of unused pesticides. This program is conducted in cooperation with ASPB, the University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service, the Arkansas Farm Bureau, ANRC, and ADEQ. Representatives from these agencies comprise the Abandoned Pesticide Advisory Board. The Abandoned Pesticide Advisory Board selects counties for <b>collection</b> <b>events</b> and has a goal of holding at least one collection event in every county in Arkansas. The Advisory Board uses priority watersheds as a guiding principle when selecting counties for pesticide collections. The pesticide collections began in 2005 in northeastern Arkansas; by the spring of 2009, at least one collection had been held in each county in eastern Arkansas. By the spring of 2011, the Abandoned Pesticide Program had collected over 744,000 pounds of unwanted pesticides from Arkansas farmers in 55 different counties (Arkansas State Plant Board,2013). The pesticide collections {{are paid for by the}} pesticide manufacturers through a fee added to the registration of each agricultural pesticide used in Arkansas. There is no cost to the farmer, and participation in the program is anonymous.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 May 1893, {{during the}} second chamber music festival, the Beethoven-Haus was opened as a {{memorial}} site and museum for Beethoven's life, work and impact. The statute from 1896 describes its purposes as follows: Maintain the memory of Ludwig van Beethoven {{by means of a}} museum and a <b>collection,</b> <b>events,</b> musical performances, prize awardings and scholarships as well as own publications. In the following decades the association was quite busy organising chamber music festivals (30 festivals until 1956) and establishing the collection. In order to complement the museum- and music-related activities, the research on Beethoven was gradually intensified. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Beethoven's birthday in 1920 the association started a proprietary series of scientific publications. In 1927, on the 100th anniversary of the composer's death, the Beethoven archive was founded. It serves as a pillar for the research on Beethoven. As such the post-war statute reads: [...] "Maintenance of memory and work". In 2004 the list of purposes and duties was reviewed and elaborated, also assumed in 2013. On its 100th anniversary in 1989 the Beethoven-Haus association moved into a new building, accommodating rooms for archive and offices as well as a chamber music hall.Several times, the activities of the Beethoven-Haus were criticised by the public. Critics regarded the state of the museum at the proper birthplace as not up-to-date and obsolete.Nevertheless, as part of the 2006 initiative [...] "Invest in Germany - Land of Ideas" [...] the former German President Horst Köhler awarded the Beethoven-Haus a prize for its innovative combination of museum, research site and new media. At the moment the Beethoven-House is preparing the 125th anniversary of the Beethoven-House association and the composer's 250th birthday ín 2020.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we analyse the {{relevance}} of harvestmen distribution data derived from opportunistic, unplanned, and non-standardised <b>collection</b> <b>events</b> in an area {{in the north of}} the Iberian Peninsula. Using specimens deposited in the BOS Arthropod Collection at the University of Oviedo, we compared these data with data from planned, standardised, and periodic collections with pitfall traps in several locations in the same area. The Arthropod Collection, begun in 1977, includes specimens derived from both sampling types, and its recent digitisation allows for this type of comparative analysis.

40|$|Abstract. Existing process mining {{techniques}} {{are able to}} discover a specific pro-cess model for a given event log. In this paper, we aim to discover a configurable process model from a <b>collection</b> of <b>event</b> logs, i. e., the model should describe a family of process variants rather than one specific process. Consider for example the handling of building permits in different municipalities. Instead of discovering a process model per municipality, we want to discover one configurable process model showing commonalities and differences among the different variants. Al-though there are various techniques that merge individual process models into a configurable process model, there are no techniques that construct a configurable process model based on a <b>collection</b> of <b>event</b> logs. By extending our ETM genetic algorithm, we propose and compare four novel approaches to learn configurable process models from <b>collections</b> of <b>event</b> logs. We evaluate these four approaches using both a running example and a <b>collection</b> of real <b>event</b> logs. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this service-learning research project was to discover current practices and barriers related to proper medication disposal while protecting {{the safety of the}} public and the integrity of the environment. Collection and analysis of unused medications followed by environmentally friendly disposal is a current vision found in the Healthy People 2020 initiative and coincides with this objective. Since 2012, medication <b>collection</b> <b>events</b> have been conducted in multiple locations in the Lafayette and West Lafayette areas. Students from the Student National Pharmaceutical Association, professors from Purdue University 2 ̆ 7 s College of Pharmacy, members of local police forces, and organizations throughout the community such as Lafayette 2 ̆ 7 s Meals on Wheels and the Tippecanoe Drug Free Coalition have all {{played a major role in}} the success of these projects. Medications were collected from residents locally and surveys inquiring about current practices and barriers relating to medication disposal were offered to these individuals. Data collected include: category of drug returned, quantity of drug returned, expiration date, automatic refill status, origin of medication, past disposal methods, reason for turning in medication, payment for disposal, knowledge of proper disposal, gender, age, and education. Disposal was anonymous and no identifying factors were collected from members of the public. The results of our medication <b>collection</b> <b>events</b> and data exemplify the need for routine collections and proper education on medication disposal.
