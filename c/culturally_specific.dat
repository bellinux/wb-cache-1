25|$|The Madhyamakālaṃkāra is an eighth-century Buddhist text, {{believed}} to have been originally composed in Sanskrit by Śāntarakṣita (725–788), Though somewhat lyrical, it is a summary and a key to his encyclopedic Tattvasamgraha. It has the fullness of the Sutrayana and Mahayana traditions' development in its place of origin before the Buddhist tradition of India was transposed by the cultures of the Far East (such as China and Japan) and elsewhere (such as Ceylon and Kashmir), where Buddhism was already flourishing in <b>culturally</b> <b>specific</b> forms. The text refutes challenges of Buddhist systems and tenets from within the tradition, and is a pedagogical discourse {{on the development of the}} yana; the philosophical challenges posed by the non-Buddhist religions and non-Dharmic traditions of India, and crystallizes a dialectical sophistication of Indian logic and the clarity of debate expected of a Khenpo of Nalanda Vihara. The text was seminal in the tradition of Samye which became known as a Nyingma institution in contrast to the emergent Sarma traditions of Atisha's (980-1054) translation phase. It documents the Nyingma view of the Two Truths, making it a canonical work. Although the text was marginalized due to the rise of the Prasaṅgika subschool of Mādhyamaka, it was revived by Ju Mipham's (1846–1912) 1876 Commentary.|$|E

Methodologically, we base our paper on a longitudinal in-depth case study that focussed on the teaching, learning and assessment practices in Greek public sector universities. Based on our Greek case example we specifically focus on how the delegation of plagiarism detection to a technical actor produces a particular set of agencies and intentionalities (a politics one might say) which unintentionally and unexpectedly conspires to constitute some students as plagiarists (who are not) and others as not (who are). We suggest that this is best explored by looking exactly at what is rendered visible and invisible in such imbrications. This has important implications for the design, implementation and use of IS in situated contexts...|$|R

2500|$|There is some {{question}} over which inflection {{to use when}} assimilating Latin and Greek words. Zamenhof generally preferred the oblique stem over the nominative singular form, as in reĝo (king), which follows the Latin oblique forms with reg– (compare English regicide), or floro (flower) as in floral, rather than nominative singular rex and flos. However, European national standards differ in this regard, resulting in debate over the form of later [...] "international" [...] borrowings, such as whether the asteroid Pallas should be Palaso in Esperanto, parallel to French and English names Pallas, or Palado, as in Italian Pallade, Russian Паллада (Palláda), and the English adjective Palladian. In some cases there are three possibilities, {{as can be seen}} in the English noun helix (x = [...] ), its plural helices (c = [...] ), and its adjective helical (c = [...] ). Although the resulting potential for conflict is frequently criticized, it does present an opportunity to disambiguate what would otherwise be homonyms based on <b>culturally</b> <b>specific</b> and often fossilized metaphors. For example, all three of the forms of Latin helix are found as Esperanto roots, one with the original meaning, and the other two representing old metaphors: helico (a spiral), heliko (a snail), helikso (the incurved rim of the ear).|$|E

A total of 914 employees {{who participated in this}} study consisted of Japanese, Chinese, Hong Kong’s, Malaysian, and Thai managers who work as parent or host country nationals for a Japanese multinational corporation expanding Asian markets. This study initially confirmed that a level of each key variable: job satisfaction and confidence, significantly differed in those countries. As the entire managerial group, by controlling age, gender, tenure, past work experience, and management positions, results of regression analysis showed that confidence powerfully increased job satisfaction. Further, with regard to five different area groups, results also illustrated the strong effect of confidence on job satisfaction in each country. Consequently, the study results have led to a conclusion that this relational aspect between the two psychological variables tends to be universalistic rather than a <b>culturally</b> contextual <b>specific</b> phenomenon.
