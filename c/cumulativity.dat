40|$|We {{investigated}} whether structural priming {{of production}} latencies {{is sensitive to}} the same factors known to influence persistence of structural choices: structure preference, <b>cumulativity</b> and verb repetition.

We found structural persistence for passives {{to be influenced by}} immediate primes and long lasting <b>cumulativity</b> (all preceding primes) (Experiment 1), and to be boosted by verb repetition (Experiment 2). In latencies we found effects for actives were sensitive to long lasting <b>cumulativity</b> (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, in latencies we found priming for actives overall, while for passives the priming effects emerged as the cumulative exposure increased but only when also aided by verb repetition.

In this work we define a large class of conservative extensions of the SM, dubbed affix stable model semantics, ASM, and study the above referred properties into two non-disjoint subfamilies, ASMh and ASMm, of the class ASM.

40|$|This paper {{relates to}} the {{question}} {{whether there is a}} uniform method of collective quantification. Several approaches to plural quantification are presented as a background for Winter's (1998) unified df it lifting strategy. The main proposal is that so-called cumulative readings, which are known to be non-iterative, are in fact derivable, under certain circumstances, by an iterative procedure. <b>Cumulativity</b> is shown {{to be one of the}} readings that are generated by Winter's df it approach, which contains a modificational component called the witness condition. However, in order to get these readings, a cumulative operator has to be applied. This operator is needed to overcome an under-generation effect of the witness condition. Further, it is shown that otherwise iteration of the df it strategy generates counter-intuitive readings. Some motivation is given for the <b>cumulativity</b> operator as well as for the underlying constraints. 1 Introduction This paper is an attempt to answer the foll [...] ...|$|E

40|$|One {{of the few}} {{objects on}} which {{there is still a}} quasi-unanimous intra-disciplinary {{consensus}} is the multi-paradigmatic condition of sociology. Beyond the acceptance of this fact, the consensus dissolves into general controversy over the positive or negative consequences of the multi-paradigmatic character of sociology. This paper analyzes the effects that meta-theoretical pluralism has had on the corpus of knowledge administrated by the sociological community, arguing that the effects of multi-paradigmaticity are negative for the most part, since they produce: a) cyclical progress, b) scattered <b>cumulativity,</b> and c) multi-localized ignorance, each of these being in turn accompanied by its own cortege of negative consequences. The analysis ends with the conclusion that, although both qualitatively and quantitatively inferior compared to that of the natural sciences, the <b>cumulativity</b> specific to sociological knowledge is not at all illusory. However, due to its familiarity and proximity to the common sense, the knowledge developed inside the sociological field of intellectual production is the victim of the “conceptual cryptomnesia effect,” by which the scientific origin of the sociological conceptions is forgotten along with their absorption into the lexicon of vernacular language...|$|E

The question of how human culture as opposed to its animal counter parts came to become open-endedly creative and cumulative is therefore one of wide and general scientific importance. Several causal factors have been proposed to date to explain this unique quality, including population size, transmission fidelity, pedagogy, and creativity. Inquiries, however, tend to focus exclusively on one factor at a time, leaving us blind to important issues regarding their relative roles and combined action. We here combine two models, one focusing on population size and the other on imitation fidelity, as constraints and enablers of evolutionary <b>cumulativity.</b> We explore how these factors interact to promote and inhibit evolutionary <b>cumulativity</b> and how the synthetic model compares to the original models individually and to empirical and experimental data. We report several findings that do not emerge in the models that we combine individually.

40|$|Non–monotonic reasoning, {{semantics}} and foundations, stable model semantics From a {{logic programming}} point of view, the stable model semantics for normal programs has {{the problem that}} logical consequences of programs cannot, in general, be stored as lemmas. This is because the set of stable models of the resulting program may change. In fact, logical consequence under the stable model semantics does not enjoy an important property required of non–monotonic entailment relations, i. e. <b>cumulativity.</b> We {{argue that it is}} possible to assert a conclusion A as a lemma in the stable model semantics, if asserting at the same time a set of facts supporting the conclusion (that we call a base set for A). The effect on the meaning of the program is that of selecting some of the stable models containing A. The collection of all base sets for A generates all the stable models containing A. We formalize this intuition by reformulating the definition of <b>cumulativity</b> accordingly. We propose a characterization of base sets that identifies the minimal ones, i. e. the fewest and smallest base sets for A. Any proof procedure for the stable model semantics (including the abductive ones) should be able, with slight modifications, to return the base sets, by applying the criteria that we propose. ...|$|E

Ten recipes from each of the categories “poultry recipes”, “fish recipes” and “meat recipes” were arbitrarily selected from each cookery book by selecting the first ten recipes in each category, and the numbers (per recipe) of steps, separate partial processes, methods, ingredients, semi-manufactured ingredients, compound semi-manufactured ingredients (defined as semi-manufactured ingredients containing no less than two raw products), and self-made semi-manufactured ingredients were counted. Regression analyses were used to quantitatively compare the cookery from different ages. We found {{a significant increase in the}} numbers (per recipe) of steps, separate partial processes, methods, ingredients and semi-manufactured ingredients. These significant increases enabled us to identify the development of cookery as an example of the general trend of <b>cumulativity</b> in long-term cultural evolution.

40|$|In Optimality Theory, {{determining}} the optimal candidate is traditionally {{done on the}} basis of strict domination. A violation of a higher ranked constraint is always more serious than no matter how many violations of lower ranked constraints. Recently, there have been indications that strict domination is not suitable as an evaluation method for some types of linguistic data. An interesting question is whether in some linguistic fields <b>cumulativity</b> of constraints - in which a combination of violations of lower ranked constraints can overrule a higher constraint violation - is a more accurate way to evaluate candidates. My research focused on the interpretation of (possible) gapping constructions. The central issue is the ambiguity in sentences such as: "Grace geeft Stan een shirt en Will een trui. " (Grace gives Stan a shirt and Will a sweaterl. Will can be the person giving Stan a sweater or he can be the person receiving the sweater. The factors influencing the interpretation of this kind of sentences can be defined as OT constraints. I implemented an OT computer model of the interpretation of gapping. This model evaluates interpretation candidates according to different constraint evaluation methods: Strict domination and three methods in which constraints interact in a cumulative manner. These four hypotheses on the evaluation of interpretation candidates were then tested in a pilot experiment, in which subjects were asked to give their interpretation of sentences. The experimental results point to an explanation in which <b>cumulativity</b> of constraints plays a role. ...|$|E
