2500|$|Chlorine and sodium/potassium {{hydroxide}} {{are among}} the most produced commodity chemicals in the world. [...] Modern production methods produce Cl2 and NaOH/KOH from the electrolysis of brine using a Nafion membrane between half-cells. [...] Before the use of Nafion, industries used mercury containing sodium amalgam to separate sodium metal from cells or asbestos diaphragms to allow for transfer of sodium ions between half cells; both technologies were developed {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century. [...] The disadvantages of these systems is worker safety and environmental concerns associated with mercury and asbestos, although economical factors also played a part. [...] Nafion was the direct result of the <b>chlor-alkali</b> industry addressing these concerns; Nafion could tolerate the high temperatures, high electrical currents, and corrosive environment of the electrolytic cells.|$|E
