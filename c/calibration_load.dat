40|$|Aerodynamic {{forces and}} moments on scaled models are {{measured}} in wind tunnels by multi-component strain gauge balances whose performance and accuracy {{are characterized by}} careful calibrations. It is well recognized that <b>calibration</b> <b>loads</b> that {{are representative of the}} combined loads experienced by the balance/model in wind tunnel test conditions lead to high accuracy of the measured loads. But, in the traditional method the <b>calibration</b> <b>loads</b> are restricted to single-component and two component loads that are unrepresentative of model loads. A recently developed method called Global Regression Method (GRM) places no such restrictions and therefore, permits application of multi-component <b>calibration</b> <b>loads</b> similar to model loads, leading to improved accuracy of measured loads. In addition, with use of GRM it is possible to substantially reduce the number of <b>calibration</b> <b>loads</b> and hence, the calibration effort by optimization of load schedule. The GRM was recently implemented and a MATLAB software developed for balance calibration data analysis at NAL. In order to illustrate the application of GRM and use of the computer program calibrations of a 6 -component internal balance were carried out with different types and number of <b>calibration</b> <b>loads</b> that included combined loads similar to model loads and the data were analyzed using GRM. The balance accuracy was assessed for a set of check loads consisting primarily of combined loads. Results showed that the accuracy when the <b>calibration</b> <b>loads</b> were similar to model loads was significantly better than that obtained using single- and two–component <b>calibration</b> <b>loads.</b> It was also found that improved accuracy could be obtained with substantially reduced number of loadings.

We show that small receiver (Te) and antenna (Ti) noise temperature errors resulting {{from the use of}} the R-J approximation are self-compensating, and the simpler approximation can be used with an insignificant Top error. The accuracy of Top, consisting of the sum of the calibrated antenna noise temperature and the receiver noise tempera-ture, is adequate using the simplified R-J approximation (physical temperature) at frequencies as high as 100 GHz.

A section of a wing designed for a high-speed aircraft structure was used to study this problem. This structure was instrumented with strain gages calibrated at both elevated and room temperatures. Load equations derived from a high-temperature <b>load</b> <b>calibration</b> were compared with equations derived from an identical <b>load</b> <b>calibration</b> at room temperature. The implications of the high temperature <b>load</b> <b>calibration</b> were studied from the viewpoint of applicability and necessity. Load equations derived from the room temperature <b>load</b> <b>calibration</b> resulted in generally lower equation standard errors than equations derived from the elevated temperature <b>load</b> <b>calibration.</b> A distributed <b>load</b> was applied to the structure at elevated temperature and strain gage outputs were measured. This applied load was then calculated using equations derived from both the room temperature and elevated temperature calibration data. It was found that {{no significant differences between the}} two equation systems existed in terms of computing this applied distributed load, as long as the thermal shifts resulting from thermal stresses could be identified. This identification requires a heating of the structure. Therefore, it is concluded that for this structure, a high temperature <b>load</b> <b>calibration</b> is not required. However, a heating of the structure is required to determine thermal shifts...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{was developed}} {{for the assessment of}} strain-gage balance calibration data that makes it possible to systematically investigate potential sources of unexpected high correlations between <b>calibration</b> <b>load</b> residuals and applied calibration loads. The algorithm investigates correlations on a load series by load series basis. The linear correlation coefficient is used to quantify the correlations. It is computed for all possible pairs of <b>calibration</b> <b>load</b> residuals and applied calibration loads that can be constructed for the given balance calibration data set. An unexpected high correlation between a load residual and a load is detected if three conditions are met: (i) the absolute value of the correlation coefficient of a residual/load pair exceeds 0. 95; (ii) the maximum of the absolute values of the residuals of a load series exceeds 0. 25 % of the load capacity; (iii) the load component of the load series is intentionally applied. Data from a baseline calibration of a six-component force balance is used to illustrate the application of the detection algorithm to a real-world data set. This analysis also showed that the detection algorithm can identify load alignment errors as long as repeat load series are contained in the balance calibration data set that do not suffer from load alignment problems...|$|E

40|$|Calibration data of a {{wind tunnel}} sting balance was {{processed}} using a candidate math model search algorithm that recommends an optimized regression {{model for the}} data analysis. During the calibration the normal force and the moment at the balance moment center were selected as independent calibration variables. The sting balance itself had two moment gages. Therefore, after analyzing the connection between <b>calibration</b> <b>loads</b> and gage outputs, {{it was decided to}} choose the difference and the sum of the gage outputs as the two responses that best describe the behavior of the balance. The math model search algorithm was applied to these two responses. An optimized regression model was obtained for each response. Classical strain gage balance load transformations and the equations of the deflection of a cantilever beam under load are used to show that the search algorithm s two optimized regression models are supported by a theoretical analysis {{of the relationship between the}} applied <b>calibration</b> <b>loads</b> and the measured gage outputs. The analysis of the sting balance calibration data set is a rare example of a situation when terms of a regression model of a balance can directly be derived from first principles of physics.

40|$|New load {{schedules}} for {{the machine}} calibration of a six-component force balance {{are currently being}} developed and evaluated at the NASA Ames Balance Calibration Laboratory. One of the proposed load schedules is discussed in the paper. It has a total of 2082 points that are distributed across 16 load series. Several criteria were applied to define the load schedule. It was decided, for example, to specify the <b>calibration</b> <b>load</b> set in force balance format as this approach greatly simplifies {{the definition of the}} lower and upper bounds of the load schedule. In addition, all loads are assumed to be applied in a calibration machine by using the one-factor-at-a-time approach. At first, all single-component loads are applied in six load series. Then, three two-component load series are applied. They consist of the load pairs (N 1, N 2), (S 1, S 2), and (RM, AF). Afterwards, four three-component load series are applied. They consist of the combinations (N 1, N 2, AF), (S 1, S 2, AF), (N 1, N 2, RM), and (S 1, S 2, RM). In the next step, one four-component load series is applied. It is the load combination (N 1, N 2, S 1, S 2). Finally, two five-component load series are applied. They are the load combination (N 1, N 2, S 1, S 2, AF) and (N 1, N 2, S 1, S 2, RM). The maximum difference between loads of two subsequent data points of the load schedule is limited to 33 % of capacity. This constraint helps avoid unwanted load "jumps" in the load schedule that can {{have a negative impact on}} the performance of a calibration machine. Only loadings of the single- and two-component load series are loaded to 100 % of capacity. This approach was selected because it keeps the total number of calibration points to a reasonable limit while still allowing for the application of some of the more complex load combinations. Data from two of NASA's force balances is used to illustrate important characteristics of the proposed 2082 -point <b>calibration</b> <b>load</b> schedule...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a one-port method for estimating model parameters of VNA calibration standards. The method involves measuring the standards through an asymmetrical passive network connected in direct mode {{and then in}} reverse mode, and using these measurements to compute the S-parameters of the network. The free parameters of the calibration standards are estimated by minimizing a figure of merit based on the expected equality of the S-parameters of the network when used in direct and reverse modes. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated through simulations, and real measurements are used to estimate the actual offset delay of a 50 -Ω <b>calibration</b> <b>load</b> that is assigned zero delay by the manufacturer.

The Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) localization approach is preferred as a cost-efficient solution to indoor localization on account of the widely-deployed WLAN infrastructures. In this paper, we propose a new WLAN Received Signal Strength (RSS) -based indoor localization approach using the semi-supervised manifold alignment with dimension expansion. In concrete terms, we first construct an innovative objective function based on the augmented physical coordinates and the corresponding WLAN RSS measurements. Second, the closed-form solution to the objective function is derived out according to the Lagrange multiplier equation, which results in the manifold in physical coordinate space. Third, the target location is estimated by matching the transformed newly-collected RSS against the manifold. The localization performance with noise perturbation is analyzed upon the constructed objective function, and meanwhile, the closed-form solution to the objective function with respect to multiple types of measurements is also derived out for the sake of leveraging all of the potential measurements for indoor localization.
