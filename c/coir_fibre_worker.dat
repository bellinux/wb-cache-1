40|$|Coir is a ligno-cellulosic fibre, {{cheap and}} abundantly {{available}} in Sri Lanka as {{a byproduct of}} the coconut industry. Coir-geotextiles, which are manufactured from coir, {{have been identified as}} good geotextile material to be used for soil reinforcement in soil erosion problems until sustainable vegetation is established. Because of this reason coir based geotextiles have the potential to be an exportable product. It has become necessary to scientifically study the properties of <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> and coir-geotextiles in great detail to meet the suitability requirements of the export market as well as the local market. Mechanical and physical properties including tensile properties, initial modulus, length, mass and diameter of brown and white <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> obtained from Kurunegala District have been used in the evaluation. Moisture absorption characteristics of <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> were also evaluated. Results show that there is a direct relationship between the length and tenacity as well as extension at break of retted brown <b>coir</b> <b>fibre.</b> This relationship is not significant in unretted white <b>coir</b> <b>fibre,</b> which is a longer fibre with a higher in tenacity and extension at break. Wet tensile strength and wet extension at break of <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> were found to be greater than the tensile strength in the conditioned state. In seawater immersion, <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> did not lose strength after 24 hours at room temperature. During a 24 hours period <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> did not lose strength significantly in the pH 5 - 9 range at ambient temperature. At different NaOH concentrations and different time periods at 25 °C, <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> were immersed in alkaline medium to find out whether the strength was affected. After 30 min in 10 % NaOH brown coir showed highest strength but white <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> showed highest strength in 25 % NaOH concentration after 30 min immersion. It was attempted to apply the idealized staple fibre yarn model to coir yarns. For this purpose coir-yarn initial modulus was calculated using results of strength tests for <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> and <b>coir</b> yarns. Calculated initial modulus is greater than experimentally obtain results but deviate considerably from the actual situvation. The durability of <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> was investigated by immersing in distilled water, acid medium, alkaline medium and saline solution at ambient temperature {{over a period of time}} and the results showed that brown <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> and white <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> had similar losses in strength in acidic medium after 3 months. White <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> lost strength significantly after 3 months in distilled water (pH= 5. 89) treatment. But both <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> do not lose strength significantly during 3 months time in alkaline medium or saline water.

40|$|In this study, <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> {{were studied}} {{for use as}} {{reinforcement}} materials for polymer and cementitious composites. The effect of fibre treatment (i. e. 5 wt. % NaOH solution at 20 °C for 30 min) on microstructure and mechanical properties of <b>coir</b> <b>fibre,</b> <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced epoxy (CFRE) and <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced cementitious (CFRC) composites were investigated. Scanning electronic microscope (SEM) {{studies were carried out}} to examine the microstructures of untreated and treated <b>coir</b> <b>fibres,</b> fibre/epoxy and fibre/cement interfaces. Mechanical properties of CFRE were determined by vibration, tensile and flexure tests and mechanical properties of CFRC were determined by compression and four-point bending tests, respectively. The test results show that <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> had a much cleaner and rougher fibre surface after the alkali treatment. Compared with the untreated CFRE, treatment improved the tensile and flexural properties of composites, i. e. 17. 8 % and 16. 7 % growth in tensile and flexural strength, respectively. However, the treatment also reduced the damping ratio of the CFRE. The increase in tensile and flexural properties and reduction in damping ratio are attributed to the improvement of fibre and epoxy matrix interfacial adhesion due to the treatment, as displayed by SEM micrographs. Compared with the plain concrete, <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> improved the compressive strength, flexural strength and toughness effectively. The treatment can further improve these properties of CFRC. SEM studies clearly confirmed that the failure modes of <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> in cement matrix are fibre breakage, fibre pull-out and fibre debonding from the cement matrix.

40|$|The {{interest}} in using natural fibres in composite materials has greatly {{increased over the}} past decades thanks to their good mechanical properties in combination with environment-friendly characteristics. In this research, Vietnamese <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> are studied and modified for use in composite materials. To be efficiently used in composite materials, the microstructure and the mechanical properties of <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> are first characterised. Secondly, the surface of natural fibres has a complex morphology with chemical heterogeneity and relatively high roughness, which strongly influences the fibre-matrix interfacial adhesion. Therefore, {{it is important to}} acquire a systematic understanding of the fibre-matrix interfacial interactions in composites. Lastly, unidirectional (UD) composites of <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> in both thermoplastic and thermoset matrices are examined to evaluate the possible value of <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> for composites. The microstructure of technical <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> is examined using SEM and SEM-CT. The results show that technical <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> comprise plenty of elementary fibres and a lacuna at the centre. The elementary fibre is built up by two main cell walls which consist of bundles of microfibrils aligned in a high angle to the <b>fibre</b> axis. <b>Coir</b> <b>fibre</b> appears to have high porosity at 22 to 30 %. The mechanical properties of <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> are determined in tensile tests including single fibre tensile testing with optical strain mapping and single fibre tensile testing using different test lengths. The results of both methods indicate that <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> are not very strong and stiff, but have high strain to failure. An integrated physical-chemical-micromechanical approach is implemented to investigate the fibre-matrix interfacial compatibility and adhesion of the <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> composites. In this study, the interface between untreated and alkali treated <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> and various thermoplastics is characterised. The differences of fibre surface chemistry and properties of the matrices in terms of surface energy and potential chemical reactions are considered. Wetting measurements of the fibres and the matrices are carried out to obtain their static equilibrium contact angles in various liquids, and these are used to estimate the surface energies comprising of different components. The work of adhesion is calculated for each composite system, accordingly. Also, fibre surface chemistry is examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to have more information about functional groups at the fibre surface, which assists in {{a deeper understanding of the}} interactions at the composite interfaces. To determine the quality of the composite interfaces, single fibre pull-out tests and transverse three point bending tests are performed on UD composites to measure interfacial shear strength and interfacial strength (mode I) respectively. The results suggest that the higher interfacial adhesion of <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> with polyvinylidene fluoride compared with polypropylene can be attributed to higher fibre-matrix physico-chemical interaction corresponding with the work of adhesion. Whilst the improvement of interfacial adhesion for <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> with maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene compared with polypropylene can probably be attributed to a chemical adhesion mechanism. In addition to the specific results for <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> composites, the integrated physical-chemical-micromechanical approach to investigate and improve fibre-matrix interface has been developed. This knowledge can be applied to study the interface of other natural fibre composite systems. Mechanical properties of UD <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> composites with both thermoplastic and thermoset matrices are assessed by tensile tests in fibre direction, flexural tests and unnotched Izod impact tests. In agreement with the interface evaluation, higher flexural strength and stiffness are found in the alkali treated fibre composites, probably thanks to the better interfacial adhesion. The impact strength of coir polypropylene composite is not significantly different from that of neat polymer, while the <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> can improve the toughness of epoxy by minimum a factor of three, when the impact strength is considered as toughness indicator. An initial study on coir-bamboo fibre hybrid composites is carried out to investigate the hybrid effect of tough <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> and brittle bamboo fibre in composites. With a low bamboo fibre fraction, a hybrid effect with an increase of composite strain to failure is obtained, which can be attributed to the high strain to failure of the <b>coir</b> <b>fibres.</b> Meanwhile, the bamboo fibres provide high stiffness and strength to the composites. The results show a potential for coir-bamboo hybrid composites, which justifies further study on this topic.

The characterization of mechanical properties for the composition samples was determined by using tensile test machine and bending test machine. Compression moulding was used to produce the composites which consists of seven sample of composites with different fibre loading along with different fibre conditions which are treated coir and untreated <b>coir</b> for <b>fibre</b> loading of 10 %, 20 % and 30 %. Water absorption test such as water uptake and thickness swelling were carried out by immersing the specimens in the water for 24 hours at room condition and the specimens also been put into oven for 24 hours at 1050 C to determine their moisture content. The density of composites was also calculated by using density of <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> and polyester resins which are 1. 20 gcm- 3 and 1. 09 gcm- 3. Overall, the study shows that treated <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> composites resulted in higher mechanical properties as increased fibre loading until they reached their maximum point compared to untreated <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> composite, this is due to interface bonding, adhesion, voids, arrangement between reinforced fibre an matrix resins. Meanwhile the water absorption and thickness swelling of <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> composites increased with higher fibre loading and untreated <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> composites shows higher results compared to treated <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> composite.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present work were to evaluate the chemical compatibility between coir (Cocos nucifera L.) and cement and to study treatment methods to improve this compatibility. In the inhibition test, cement hydration temperature evolution was measured in the absence and presence of untreated and treated <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> (cold water, hot water and NaOH), besides the addition of 4 % of CaCl 2. The chemical characterization of untreated and treated <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> was done by determining the content of extractives, lignin, and holocellulose. The inhibition test graded the untreated fibre as “extreme inhibition,” ratifying {{the need to provide}} it a treatment. Treatments done on <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> affected positively the compatibility between cement and fibre, reducing the inhibition. The treatments reduced the lignin coir fibres’ and extractives proportion, whose variation was significantly correlated with the reduction of the inhibitory index. These results indicate a possibility for future incorporation of these fibres into the production of mineral composites...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Coir</b> <b>fibres</b> {{are found}} between the hard, {{internal}} shell and the outer coat of a coconut. The individual fibre cells are narrow and hollow, with thick walls made of cellulose. They are pale when immature, but later become hardened and yellowed as a layer of lignin is deposited on their walls. Each cell is about 1 mm long and [...] in diameter. [...] Fibres are typically 10 to 30 cm long. The two varieties of coir are brown and white. Brown coir harvested from fully ripened coconuts is thick, strong and has high abrasion resistance. It is typically used in mats, brushes and sacking. Mature brown <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> contain more lignin and less cellulose than fibres such as flax and cotton, so are stronger but less flexible. White <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> harvested from coconuts before they are ripe are white or light brown in color and are smoother and finer, but also weaker. They are generally spun to make yarn used in mats or rope.|$|R

Stress-strain studies carried out by Universal Testing Machine, reveal that the gain in tensile strength of the <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> can be obtained by mercerization and alkali treatment by NaOH solution of 15 % concentration. On thermal treatment the tensile strength decreases due to degradation, accompanied by dehydration and depolymerization.

This article presents a review on the physical, mechanical, chemical and thermal properties of gomuti fibre in comparison with other common natural fibres. Furthermore, this article reviews the mechanical properties of gomuti fibre composites with thermoset polymer resins based on the existing published literature. It is observable that gomuti fibre has a close similarity to <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> in its physical and mechanical properties than the other natural fibres. It has the characteristics of lower density, strength and modulus, but higher elongation. The composites with gomuti fibre also exhibit properties similar to <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> composites. ...|$|R
40|$|Coconuts are abundantly {{growing in}} coastal areas of {{tropical}} countries. The coconut husk {{is available in}} large quantities as residue from coconut production in many areas, which is yielding the coarse <b>coir</b> <b>fibre.</b> The husk comprises ca. 30 wt. % <b>coir</b> <b>fibres</b> and 70 wt. % pith. Both fibre and pith are extremely high in lignin and phenolic content. The lignin is typically for monocotyledonous plants rich in syringyl with appreciable amounts of p-hydroxyphenyl units. The <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> is composed {{for at least one}} third of Mason lignin while lower molecular weight phenolics can be found as extractives in considerable amounts, especially in uounger nuts. The thermal behaviour of the original (chemically unmodified) lignin in the plant tissues at temperatures above 140 degreesC, where it melts and shows thermosetting properties, has been investigated. This property,of, the coconut husk lignin was explored for application as intrinsic resin in board production, utilising whole fresh husks. Based on this concept, a simple and efficient technology has been developed to produce high strength-high density panels, without addition of chemical binders.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the compressive and flexural behavior of FFRP tube confined plain concrete (PC) and <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced concrete (CFRC) composite columns. The mass content of <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> considered was 1 % of cement. Eighteen cylinders were tested under uniaxial compression and 12 beams were tested under four-point bending. In axial compression, two types of FFRP and concrete bond were considered, i. e. concrete confined by (i) FFRP tube and (2) by FFRP wrappings. They were termed as naturally and mechanically bonded, respectively. Effect of <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> inclusion and FFRP confinement on the stress-strain relationship, confinement effectiveness, and load bearing capacity, deflection, and failure mode were studied. Test results show that in compression, both FFRP tube and FFRP wrapping confinements enhance the axial compressive strength and ultimate strain of concrete significantly. In flexure, the FFRP tube can increase the lateral load carrying capacity and the deflection several {{times larger than the}} unconfined concrete columns. The flexural behavior of FFRP tube confined CFRC is highly dependent on the tube thickness. Additionally, coir fiber inclusion reduced the numbers and widths of the cracks in the concrete, thus significantly affect the failure mode of FFRP tube confined CFRC in flexure...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} that bamboo and <b>coir</b> <b>fibres,</b> with an epoxy resin matrix, can be fabricated to produce unidirectional composites. A secondary aim was to demonstrate the production of intra-ply hybrids with unidirectional bamboo fibres and spread E-glass fibres. The methods explored in this work to produce the unidirectional arrays of bamboo and <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> preforms involved the use of a carding process to align the as-received bamboo fibres. A new method for spreading E-glass bundles or tows was developed in the author’s research group. The feasibility of using the spread E-glass fibre bundles with the uni-directional bamboo preforms to manufacture a new class of intra-fibre hybrids was undertaken. A resin infusion fabrication method was used to manufacture the uni-directional bamboo and E-glass/bamboo. Tensile testing was used to determine the mechanical properties of the bamboo and E-glass/bamboo hybrid composites. The as-fabricated cross-sections and the post-tensile tested fracture surfaces were characterised using optical and scanning electron microscopy respectively. This study developed and demonstrated a method to fabricate uni-directional arrays of bamboo and <b>coir</b> <b>fibre</b> preforms and a technique to produce intra-ply hybrid bamboo/E-glass composites. ...|$|R
