40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{presence}} of anticoagulant rodenticides in animals with a diagnosis of suspected poisoning and in bait samples. The survey was carried out from 2010 to 2012, in 2 regions of South Italy (Puglia and Basilicata) on 300 organs of animals and 90 suspected bait samples. The qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted using an analytical method based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorimetric detection (FLD) for the simultaneous determination of 8 anticoagulant rodenticides (bromadiolone, brodifacoum, <b>coumachlor,</b> coumafuryl, coumatetralyl, difenacoum, flocoumafen, and warfarin). The presence of anticoagulant rodenticides was detected in 33 organs of animals (11 % of the total) and 6 bait samples (7 % of the total). The most commonly detected compound was <b>coumachlor</b> (47 % of 39 positive samples) followed by bromadiolone (24 %), and brodifacoum (11 %). The species mostly involved in anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning were dogs and cats. This study emphasizes {{the relevance of the}} determinations of anticoagulant rodenticides in cases of suspected poisoning in veterinary practice...|$|E

40|$|A reversed-phase {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic {{method was}} developed {{for the analysis of}} eight anticoagulant rodenticides in animal liver. Coumarinic anticoagulant rodenticides (brodifacoum, bromadiolone, <b>coumachlor,</b> coumatetralyl, difenacoum, and warfarin) were detected by using a gradient elution and a fluorimetric detection. Indanedione anticoagulant rodenticides (chlorophacinone and diphacinone) were detected by using an isocratic elution and an UV detection. Anticoagulants were extracted from liver with mixtures of acetone/diethylether and acetone/chloroform. Extracts were applied to solid-phase extraction cartridges. Linearity was checked over the concentration range 0. 1 - 0. 6 pg/g. Relative standard deviations of within-run and between-run variability were all between 5. 7 and 10. 3 %. Recoveries from spiked liver samples were between 51. 7 (difenacoum) and 78. 2 % (warfarin). Limits of detection were between 0. 01 (difenacoum and warfarin) and 0. 11 pg/g (chlorophacinone) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} validation of a novel method for quantification of the oral anticoagulant drug warfarin in dried plasma spots (DPS) by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Blood plasma was chosen as a biological fluid to preclude {{the influence of the}} hematocrit on the results of the analysis. A 30 [*]μL sample of rat plasma was placed onto Whatman 903 Protein Saver Card and was allowed to dry. A single DPS is sufficient for preparing eight 3. 2 [*]mm discs, each containing approximately 1. 5 – 1. 6 [*]μL of plasma. Warfarin extraction from one 3. 2 [*]mm disc was carried out by adding 200 [*]μL of the acetonitrile[*]:[*]water mixture (1 [*]:[*] 1, v/v) containing 10 [*]mM NH 4 COOH (pH 4. 0), with incubation on a shaker at 1000 [*]rpm for 1 [*]h at 25 °C. After chromatographic separation, warfarin and <b>coumachlor</b> (an internal standard) were measured using negative-ion multiple-reaction monitoring with ion transitions m/z 307 → 161 for warfarin and m/z 341 → 161 for the internal standard. The working range of this method is 10 – 10, 000 [*]ng/mL. Within this range, intra- and interday variability of precision and accuracy was < 13 % and recovery was 82 – 99 %. The results indicate that the new method requires only small plasma samples and may be useful for pharmacokinetic research on warfarin...|$|E
40|$|Four {{rodent control}} techniques-sustained baiting (SB) with <b>coumachlor.</b> pulsed baiting (PB) with brodifacoum. a lethal {{electrified}} barrier (LEB), and a nonlethal electrified barrier (NLEB) -were evaluated on the experimental farm of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. A fifth treatment (no experimental rodent control) was established for reference. Mean tiller damage and rodent activity, respectively. near harvest were 1. 00 % 1 and 1. 5 % in the LEB plots, 1. 6 % and 18. 0 % in the SB plots, 2. 1 % and 16. 0 % in the PB plots, and 4. 1 % and 32. 5 % in the NLEB plots. Highest mean tiller damage (9. 3 %) and rodent activity (56. 0 %) occurred in plots with no experimental rodent control. Both baiting methods (SB and PB) were {{less expensive than}} barrier methods (LEB and NLEB). During an 80 -day crop protection period prevalent on the IRRl experimental farm, the total cost per hectare (US$) for protecting experimental plots from rodent damage was $ 26 for SB. $ 27 for PB, $ 268 for NLEB, and S 1285 for LEB. Baiting methods were more cost-effective and are recommended for general rodent control on research farms that can tolerate ≤ 2 % rodent damage without losing experimental data. For small research plots demanding {{a greater degree of}} protection, an effective barrier system such as the LEB or a combination of the NLEB and LEB should be used...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation involves the development of chiral and achiral analysis using capillary electrochromatography (CEC) and CEC coupled to mass spectrometry (CEC-MS). Chapter 1 briefly reviews CEC fundamentals and latest development on chiral CEC and CEC-MS. The CEC-UV enantioseparations for several acidic compounds are described in Chapter 2. The optimum resolutions for these acidic enantiomers are achieved in ion-suppression mode, i. e. with an acidic mobile phase. One of major drawback in coupling CEC with MS is the bubble formation at the column outlet end, resulting in irreproducible retention time and erratic baseline, or even current breakdown. By introducing internal tapered columns, the aforementioned limitations of CEC-MS are successfully overcome in Chapter 3. The CEC-MS enantioseparation of warfarin and <b>coumachlor</b> is carefully investigated and applied to quantify R- and S-warfarin in human plasma. For individual enantiomers, a concentration of 25 ng/mL is detectable. To further improve the robustness of CEC-MS column, a new procedure of fabricating internal tapered columns is reported in Chapter 4. These internal tapered columns demonstrate excellent ruggedness, low background noise, and good compatibility in reversed-phase and polar organic modes of CEC-MS. In chapter 5, the feasibility of using internal tapered columns packed with vancomycin chiral stationary phase (CSP) is explored for simultaneous enantioseparation of eight â-blockers using CEC-MS. After a careful optimization of the mobile phase composition, sheath liquid and spray chamber parameter, 15 out of 16 enantiomers could be simultaneously resolved with excellent efficiency and detection sensitivity. The synthesis and characterization of sulfated and sulfonated cellulose phenylcarbamate CSPs is described in Chapter 6. The use of these CSPs, especially the sulfonated one, significantly enhances the EOF profile and sample throughput but maintain high enantiomeric resolving power under various modes of CEC and CEC-MS. By combining CEC and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI) MS, Chapter 7 demonstrates the separation and detection of mono-methylated benzo[a]pyrene (MBAP) isomers with ~ 100 times enhancement on detection sensitivity than CEC-UV. In Appedix 2, monolithic columns are synthesized through photopolymerized sol-gel approach and utilized for CEC and CEC-APPI-MS of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and alkyl phenyl ketones...|$|E
