25|$|May 27, 1971: A 7 {{train was}} {{disabled}} in the Steinway Tunnel after a short-circuit {{in a third}} rail <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> filled the tunnel with smoke. The train was stuck in the tunnel of almost two hours because of difficulty and hazards in evacuating the passengers. One person {{died of a heart}} attack while the train was stuck.|$|E
25|$|The LIRR's {{electrified}} {{lines are}} powered by 750 V DC third rail with the <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> {{running along the}} top of the rail, similar to the New York City Subway and PATH trains. This system is currently incompatible with Metro-North's third rail, which is under-running, though the M8 fleet and the future M9 fleet can use both types of third rails.|$|E
500|$|Both {{cars had}} two bogies, with power on all axles, giving a Bo'Bo' wheel arrangement. Four {{traction}} motors, each of , powered the car, giving {{a top speed}} of [...] and an acceleration of 1.3m/s2 (4.3ft/s2). The trains were equipped with both pantograph and <b>contact</b> <b>shoe,</b> the current for both of which is supplied at 750volt direct current. The trains could not be connected for multiple running with the T1000 trains.|$|E
5000|$|Brecknell Willis is a British company {{headquartered}} in Chard, Somerset, and brand-name of electrification equipment for railways, mostly pantographs and <b>contact</b> <b>shoes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The trains have metal <b>contact</b> blocks called <b>shoes</b> (or <b>contact</b> <b>shoes</b> or pickup <b>shoes)</b> {{which make}} <b>contact</b> with the {{conductor}} rail. The traction current {{is returned to}} the generating station through the running rails. The conductor rail is usually made of high conductivity steel, and the running rails are electrically connected using wire bonds or other devices, to minimize resistance in the electric circuit. <b>Contact</b> <b>shoes</b> can be positioned below, above, or beside the third rail, {{depending on the type}} of third rail used; these third rails are referred to as bottom-contact, top-contact, or side-contact, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{conductor}} rails {{have to be}} interrupted at level crossings, crossovers, and substation gaps. Tapered rails are provided {{at the ends of}} each section, to allow a smooth engagement of the train's <b>contact</b> <b>shoes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In January 1889, Boston {{introduced}} its first electric streetcars, which became so popular and noteworthy that poet Oliver Wendell Holmes composed a verse {{about the new}} trolley pole technology, and the sparking <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> at its apex: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{few lines}} of the Paris Métro in France operate on a four-rail power scheme. The trains move on rubber tyres which roll {{on a pair of}} narrow roll ways made of steel and, in some places, of concrete. Since the tyres do not conduct the return current, the two guide bars {{provided}} outside the running 'roll ways' become, in a sense, a third and fourth rail which each provide 750 V DC, so at least electrically it is a four-rail scheme. Each wheel set of a powered truck carries one traction motor. A side sliding (side running) <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> picks up the current from the vertical face of each guide bar. The return of each traction motor, as well as each wagon, is effected by one <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> each that slide on top of each one of the running rails. This and all other rubber-tyred metros that have a [...] track between the roll ways operate in the same manner.|$|E
2500|$|Another unusual aspect was the {{configuration}} of the third rail. Unlike other American commuter-rail agencies that operate trains powered by third rails, which have a <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> on top of their third rail, Metro-North trains' contact shoes draws current {{from the bottom of the}} third rail during operation. The Metro-North's under-running third rails are designed in order to prevent ice from building up on top during winter months and reduce the possibility of inadvertent contact with the high-voltage rail; as a consequence, the Metro-North third rails are much safer than the traditional over-running third rails. To facilitate this, the ends of the third rails adjacent to grade crossings have a slight upturn. [...] "This has never happened before, and this is a rare configuration of a third rail," [...] U.S. Senator Charles Schumer, said. [...] "Do those two add up to the explanation for this terrible, terrible tragedy? Very possibly." [...] But Steve Ditmeyer, a former Federal Railroad Administration official, told the Associated Press it would be impossible to be sure that an under-running shoe lifted the rail without also doing tests to see if the same thing would happen in the more common over-running configuration.|$|E
40|$|The {{electrode}} column {{is the heart}} of the submerged arc furnace. Superior electrode performance provides im-proved furnace performance. This paper describes the main features of the {{electrode column}} that delivers su-perior performance in furnaces worldwide, developed by Pyromet. Pyromet’s electrode comprises the compact slipping device, lower electrode assembly, upper and lower mantles, self-adjusting electrode seal, paste heaters, and Pyromet’s patented innovative electrode breakage detection and length determination system. Pyromet’s slipping device features compact interlocking clamping rings, incorporating fail-safe spring-loaded design. The interlocked clamping rings distribute the clamping force over a larger area of the elec-trode casing, preventing damage. The slipping device assembly features a low maintenance modular design that allows rapid slipping cycle times, back slipping, and compatibility with Pyromet’s electrode breakage de-tection and length determination system. Pyromet’s lower electrode assembly consists of the <b>contact</b> <b>shoes,</b> pressure bellows, pressure ring and heat shields. The <b>contact</b> <b>shoes</b> and pressure ring are designed for long, trouble free operation whilst the pressure bellow configuration equalise contact pressure and current distribution.

These locomotives have <b>contact</b> <b>shoes</b> compatible with Metro-North's under-running third rail power distribution system. Shoreliner series coaches are used in push-pull operation.|$|R
50|$|The M8s have {{regenerative}} braking; {{each time}} that the cars go into braking mode, the cars feed back power into the catenary system. The M8's are equipped with <b>contact</b> <b>shoes</b> that can operate on both Metro-North's under-running and the LIRR over-running third rail.|$|R
5000|$|Research in the G7 {{programme}} {{showed that}} the bulk of the longitudinal aerodynamic resistance (drag) of the pantograph and the largest component of vertical aerodynamic forces (lift) acting on it derive from the <b>contact</b> <b>shoe.</b> [...] For the HEMU-400X, researchers developed an aerodynamically optimised <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> cross section that reduced drag by about 40% and lift amplitude by about 25% in comparison to the <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> of the KTX-II pantographs.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{they have}} one or more {{spring-loaded}} arms that press a collector or <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> against the rail or overhead wire. As the vehicle moves, the <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> slides along the wire or rail to draw the electricity needed to run the vehicle's motor.|$|E

50|$|The {{extension}} was {{not completed}} until 1917 and operation {{did not start}} until 1920 so the cars were initially transferred to the Bakerloo tube for use on the Watford extension, {{for which they were}} fitted with <b>contact</b> <b>shoes</b> for the 4th rail.|$|R
5000|$|The D-type is articulated, {{consisting}} of three car body sections, sequentially labeled A, B and C, carried on four trucks. All four trucks are powered by one [...] motor each. Two trucks {{are placed on}} kingpins near {{the ends of the}} A and C sections and don't have <b>contact</b> <b>shoes.</b> The other two trucks are placed beneath each of the articulation drums that attach the center B section to the A and C sections. These trucks have <b>contact</b> <b>shoes.</b> The wheel diameter varies with the type of axle: the motor axle wheels are 34 in in diameter while the trailer axle wheels are just 31 in in diameter. The D-types were the first articulated rapid transit rolling stock used in the United States.|$|R

50|$|Electric {{railways}} with third rails, {{or fourth}} rails, in tunnels carry collector shoes projecting laterally (sideways), or vertically, from their bogies. The <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> may slide {{on top of}} the third rail (top running), on the bottom (bottom running) or on the side (side running). The side running <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> is used against the guide bars on rubber-tired metros. A vertical <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> is used on ground-level power supply systems, stud contact systems and fourth rail systems. A pair of contact shoes was used on underground current collection systems. The <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> on a stud contact system is called a ski collector. The ski collector moves vertically to accommodate slight variations in the height of the studs. Contact shoes may also be used on overhead conductor rails, on guide bars or on trolley wires. Most railways use three rails, while the London Underground uses four rails.|$|E

50|$|Werner Siemens {{introduced}} his the first collector for trackless vehicles with his Electromote cart in 1882, and in 1901 Max Schiemann demonstrated sliding <b>contact</b> <b>shoes,</b> which were pressed by springs against the overhead wires. Five years later Eugenio Cantono from Rome combined these two principles and exhibited six trolleybuses at the world's fair Milan International, 1906.|$|R
50|$|Until 2010 the Oslo Metro line 1 {{changed from}} third rail to {{overhead}} line power at Frøen station. Due {{to the many}} level crossings, it was deemed difficult to install a third rail {{on the rest of}} the older line's single track. After 2010 third rails are used in spite of level crossings. The third rails have gaps, but there are two <b>contact</b> <b>shoes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dewirements — Trolley poles {{sometimes}} {{come off}} of the wire. Dewirements are relatively rare in modern systems with well-maintained overhead wires, hangers, fittings and <b>contact</b> <b>shoes.</b> Trolleybuses are equipped with special insulated pole ropes which drivers use to reconnect the trolley poles with the overhead wires. When approaching switches, trolleybuses usually must decelerate {{in order to avoid}} dewiring, and this deceleration can potentially add slightly to traffic congestion.|$|R

50|$|Another four-rail {{system is}} line M1 of the Milan Metro, where current is drawn by a lateral, flat bar with side contact, with return via a central rail with top contact. Along some {{sections}} {{on the northern}} part of the line an overhead line is also in place, to allow line M2's trains (that use pantographs and higher voltage, and have no <b>contact</b> <b>shoes)</b> to access a depot located on line M1. In depots, line M1 trains use pantographs because of safety reasons, with transition made near the depots away from revenue tracks.|$|R
50|$|An {{internal}} camera circuit shorts {{the center}} <b>contact</b> and <b>shoe</b> mount, thus triggering the flash. The trigger voltage (for a flash) between the center <b>contact</b> and the <b>shoe</b> has varied over the years, between manufacturers, {{and even in}} the same manufacturer. When the contacts with a shutter were mechanical contacts, the actual voltage and polarity did not matter too much as long as it did not cause arcing, but now with electronic triggering, either or both can cause problems.|$|R
5000|$|After the North Shore ceased operations, {{the sets}} {{were sold to}} the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company, known as the Red Arrow Lines, and renamed Liberty Liners. The trolley poles and steps were removed, new doors were added in the center coach sections, and updated third-rail <b>contact</b> <b>shoes</b> were {{installed}} to operate on the Norristown High Speed Line, which uses third rail and high-level platforms between Upper Darby, Pennsylvania and Norristown. The tavern-lounges continued in service, providing coffee and pastry in the morning, and beverages and snacks in the evening. 801-802 was named [...] "Valley Forge", while 803-804 became [...] "Independence Hall". They were retired in 1978.|$|R

50|$|The {{electric}} transmission system for modern electric rail systems {{consists of an}} upper, weight-carrying wire (known as a catenary) from which is suspended a contact wire. The pantograph is spring-loaded and pushes a <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> up against {{the underside of the}} contact wire to draw the current needed to run the train. The steel rails of the tracks act as the electrical return. As the train moves, the <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> slides along the wire and can set up standing waves in the wires which break the contact and degrade current collection. This means that on some systems adjacent pantographs are not permitted.|$|E
50|$|The {{pantographs}} are screw-mounted to {{the roof}} at three points. Pantograph 1 is connected directly through the roof to the main control switch in the engine room; pantograph 2 is connected via a cable splice running along the side wall of the engine room to the main switch. The contact shoes are outfitted with a monitoring system in case of <b>contact</b> <b>shoe</b> breakage. Inside of the <b>contact</b> <b>shoe,</b> which is made of graphite, runs an air channel, which is overpressurised. In case of breakage, the air escapes, causing the pantograph to automatically retract, preventing possible damage to the overhead contact wire.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{a case of}} <b>shoe</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis from DMF identified by the Poison Control Centre of Milan (PCCM), Italy, in 2009. A 35 year old woman was affected by irritant reactions while wearing shoes contaminated with DMF. Exposure to these shoes was limited to a 8 hour period and was not repeated. In the following days the patient suffered feet blistering and swelling limited to the area in <b>contact</b> with <b>shoe</b> vamp. Topical application of cortisone did not prevent development of bullous eczema. After 20 days from exposure, the lesions were healed but the skin remained red, dry and very sensitive. Chemical analyses of shoes quantified an average concentration of DMF of 383 mg/kg. The patient refused to be patch tested. The observation here reported confirm that DMF {{should be considered a}} possible causal agent in <b>shoe</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis. Documentation of cases exposed to this chemical provide a relevant support to characterize clinical manifestations and to identifying contaminated articles...|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the gaps}} in the {{conductor}} rail (e.g., at level crossings and junctions) a train can stop {{in a position where}} all of its power pickup shoes are in gaps, so that no traction power is available. The train is then said to be [...] "gapped". Another train must then be brought up behind the stranded train to push it on to the conductor rail, or a jumper cable may be used to supply enough power to the train to get one of its <b>contact</b> <b>shoes</b> back on the third rail. Avoiding this problem requires a minimum length of trains that can be run on a line. Locomotives have either had the backup of an on-board diesel engine system (e.g., British Rail Class 73), or have been connected to shoes on the rolling stock (e.g. Metropolitan Railway).|$|R
