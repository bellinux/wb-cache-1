25|$|As {{with many}} other {{microcredit}} methodologies, village banking eliminates collateral (the poor man's obstacle to receiving commercial bank loans) as a loan prerequisite. Instead, it relies on a system of <b>cross-guarantees,</b> where each member of a village bank ensures the loan of every other member. This system gives rise to an atmosphere of social pressure within the village bank, where the cost of social embarrassment motivates bank members to repay their loans in full.

40|$|I present {{evidence}} that the <b>cross-guarantee</b> authority granted to the FDIC by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 has unexpectedly strengthened the Federal Reserve's source-of-strength doctrine. In particular, I find that a bank affiliated with a multi-bank holding company is significantly safer than either a stand-alone bank or a bank affiliated with a one-bank holding company. Not only does affiliation reduce the probability of future financial distress, but distressed affiliated banks {{are more likely to}} receive capital injections and recover more quickly than other banks. Moreover, the effects of affiliation are strengthened for an expanding bank holding company. However, the effects of affiliation are weakened when the parent has less than full ownership of the subsidiary. Most interestingly, my results show that these differences in behavior across affiliation did not exist before 1989, when the <b>cross-guarantee</b> authority was introduced.

50|$|An {{alternative}} form {{of poverty}} alleviation {{is known as}} credit-led microfinance. This approach involves a group of 15-30 entrepreneurs who together receive loans from HOPE International or its local partner. Each client <b>cross-guarantees</b> the loans of other groups members {{since there is no}} form of collateral to offer for the loan. As they access much-needed capital, clients can launch or expand businesses by purchasing productive assets, buying supplies in bulk, improving inventory, or investing in improvements. Accountability to the group provides powerful incentive to make regular loan repayments and to contribute additional savings to the group. In some cases, clients graduate out of a community banking setup and move on to a solidarity group, where loan amounts are higher.|$|R

40|$|Dramatic {{changes in}} recent decades in the {{economics}} of the finan-cial services industry, due largely to the computer revolution, have destroyed the efficacy of traditional financial services regulation. Despite these developments, the federal government has merely tin-keredwith the current regulatory system. Suchtinkering is counterpro-ductive because the current rigid, central-planning style of financial services regulation is inherently flawed. Instead, we must create a market-driven regulatory model that gives individual banksandthrifts the flexibility to pursue unique business strategies. The 100 percent <b>cross-guarantee</b> concept is a reform proposal that would meetthis test. Embodied in legislationintroduced in September 1992 by Rep. Tom Petri (R. -Wis.), its implementationwill quickly lead to better-priced and therefore wiser bank lending while eliminating the risk federal deposit insurance now poses to taxpayers. Cross-guarantees also will end “regulatory arbitrage, ” that is, the ffight of lower-risk assets from banks andthrifts to less-taxed andless-regulated channels of financial intermediation. Americawould have a safer and more efficient financial system as a result.

40|$|This Article {{considers}} the federal banking regulation regime implemented {{in response to}} the widespread bank failures of the 1980 s and early 1990 s. The first section of the Article examines the moral hazard problem created by the presence of the deposit insurance scheme and the market discipline debate that has attempted to correct the moral hazard problem. The Author argues that the law has evolved to make bank holding companies the primary enforcers of market discipline. The Article’s second section examines the specific regulatory changes that have been designed to create an incentive for bank holding companies to impose discipline on bank management. The source of strength doctrine, regulatory agreements, capital restoration plans, the elaboration of a general fiduciary duty to regulators, equitable subordination, <b>cross-guarantee</b> provisions, preferences, and fraudulent conveyances all are part of a strategy to make bank holding companies more responsible for bank failure. The third section of the Article looks at the potential effects of the regulatory scheme. The Author argues that the regulatory attempts to make bank holding companies the enforcers of market discipline are misguides because they will not achieve their intend effect. Instead, the banking industry will be saddled with excessive regulations that will place it at a competitive disadvantage relative to the other players in the financial services industry...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{understood}} that moral hazard arises in debt financing. Equity holders can expropriate creditors by inducing them to lend at a lower rate of interest than is commensurate with the risk of loan, either by misleading them about {{the true nature of}} the firm’s risk (asymmetric information) or by changing the risk of the firm after the loan is made, but before it is paid off (asset substitution). This paper considers the implications of moral hazard issues when a firm makes a sequence of investments and creditors can not fully specify and/or investors can not fully commit to the risk of future investments. Sequential real estate acquisitions or development projects are examples of the situation we are considering. We show that when lenders are aware of the moral hazard problem and act rationally to price this into their debt contracts, the pricing of this risk can bias investments decisions toward riskier investments. This occurs, not by constraining investment decisions, but by creating incentives to follow an anticipated and ex ante priced path. In this environment <b>cross-guarantees</b> (recourse) may result in higher rather than lower interest rates. We conclude that in the presence of this moral hazard nonrecourse lending or bankruptcy remote entities are the first best from the perspective of controlling moral hazard risk while giving investors the opportunity to invest in futur...|$|R
40|$|The typical large {{corporation}} divides {{itself into}} numerous subsidiaries but then overrides the liability barriers between them {{by having the}} subsidiaries and the parent company <b>cross-guarantee</b> each other 2 ̆ 7 s major debts. Previous scholarly theories of the corporate group cannot explain why. The leading theory posits that the subsidiaries {{make it easier for}} creditors to evaluate risk because they enable each creditor to lend against a discrete asset pool within the broader enterprise. But any such efficiency would be undercut by the guarantees, which transmit credit risk across subsidiary boundaries. This Article argues that the combination of subsidiaries and intragroup guarantees reflects a type of shareholder opportunism termed correlation-seeking. Because the insolvency risks of the entities in the typical corporate group are highly correlated, the intragroup guarantees provide the group 2 ̆ 7 s shareholders with a one-way bet. The guarantees lower the interest rates on the guaranteed debts, thus enriching the shareholders as long as the group stays solvent. And if the group falls insolvent, the triggering of liability on the guarantees makes no difference to the shareholders, whose equity stakes are wiped out anyway. The guarantees instead dilute the recoveries of the group 2 ̆ 7 s nonguaranteed creditors. This separation of burden and benefit induces firms to form too many subsidiaries and to overuse guarantees, thereby undermining transparency, complicating bankruptcy proceedings, and introducing other distortions. Current fraudulent transfer doctrine perversely upholds those guarantees that {{are most likely to be}} overused. Doctrinal reform based on risk correlations would deter guarantee overuse and would reduce bankruptcy courts 2 ̆ 7 dependence on the controversial remedy of substantive consolidation...|$|E
40|$|After the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, the U. S. banking {{industry}} has significantly transformed its organisation structure from banks into bank holding companies (BHCs) {{as a result}} of the consolidation process, resulting in larger and more complex BHCs. Under the source-of-strength doctrine and the <b>cross-guarantee</b> authority, a BHC is required to inject capital into the bank subsidiary when it is financially distressed. However, these bank-failed resolutions were introduced before the deregulation; therefore, have not taken into account the increased organisational complexity of BHCs since then. Systemic importance of BHCs has recently attracted attention from policymakers and researchers. Accordingly, the complexity of BHCs will generate concerns about the risk implication of their subsidiaries as compared to the stand-alone structure. This thesis consists of three interrelated essays on stand-alone commercial banks, single-bank holding company (SBHC) affiliates and multi-bank holding company (MBHC) affiliates in the U. S. {{banking industry}}. It investigates the role that these financial intermediaries play in (i) banking business activities, (ii) insolvency risk, and (iii) mergers and acquisitions (M&As). The first essay is a qualitative analysis about on- and off-balance sheet analysis, asset securitization and derivatives of these banks which provide a thorough understanding of the difference in permissible scopes of banking business activities among stand-alone banks, SBHC affiliates and MBHC affiliates based on Bank’s Uniform Bank Performance Report. The findings show that SBHC affiliates and MBHC affiliates pursue diversification strategies by running a broad range of activities from traditional lending business to off-balance sheet, asset securitization and derivatives whereas stand-alone banks are more specialised. However, SBHC affiliates show more concentration on taking deposits, issuing loans and demonstrate the most important role in financial intermediation in the U. S. banking system as compared to MBHC affiliates and stand-alone banks. In a striking contrast, MBHC affiliates are dominant in off-balance sheet activities, asset securitization, and derivative activities. This suggests that the MBHC group performs the main role of disintermediation in the U. S. The second essay compares the differences in insolvency risk of stand-alone banks, SBHC affiliates and MBHC affiliates by using U. S. commercial bank data and BHC data from 1994 to 2012. The study’s results show that MBHCs in the U. S. have lower insolvency risk than SBHCs and stand-alone commercial banks at the parent levels, but have significant higher insolvency risk than both at the subsidiary levels. These results suggest that BHC affiliates benefit from an internal capital market and increased diversification from the BHC structure, but face risks of the increased complexity if the number of subsidiaries increases. The third essay investigates the difference in the likelihood of being targets and acquirers among stand-alone banks, SBHC affiliates and MBHC affiliates by using M&A data on U. S. commercial banks from 1997 to 2012. The reported results show that MBHC affiliates exhibit a greater likelihood of being targets than do stand-alone commercial banks, while stand-alone banks have a greater probability of becoming targets than do SBHC affiliates. The findings show that MBHC affiliates tend to have a greater likelihood of being acquirers than do SBHC affiliates. SBHC affiliates have a greater probability of being acquirers than do stand-alone banks. Those banks that acquire another bank within the same MBHC structure tend to be smaller and more financially constrained than those banks acquiring outside the same MBHC structure, whereas targets that are acquired by another bank within the same MBHC structure tend to be smaller, with higher profitability and capital than targets that are acquired by banks from outside the MBHC structure. The results suggest that the MBHC parent attempts to discipline distressed, poorly performing and smaller affiliates by involving them in M&As. To sum up, this study provides four policy implications. First, regulators should devote particular effort to regulating banks at the subsidiary levels to restrict their risk-taking behaviour. In this sense, the regulators should revise the source-of-strength doctrine <b>cross-guarantee</b> authority to ensure that MBHC affiliates can receive their parent’s bail-out in the future when in distress. Second, regarding complexity issues inside BHC structure, regulators should consider risk exposure between banks affiliated with SBHC and MBHC separately. Third, understanding the fact that MBHC parent attempts to hinder inherent risks of their subsidiaries by involving them in successive M&A inside the structure, the bank regulators should put more restrictions on their M&A applications and reveal their problems to the financial market. Finally, stand-alone banks should be encouraged to transform into SBHC affiliates in the future. Consequently, the Federal Reserve should make the path easier for banks to transform into SBHCs to increase their stability in the U. S. banking system...|$|E
40|$|Banking law and {{bankruptcy}} law clash. This is most evident when a {{bank holding company}} (parent company) becomes insolvent after it has made an asset transfer to its financially troubled bank subsidiary. The Bankruptcy Code (Code) governs the insolvency proceedings of the bank holding company. Predictably, the parent company 2 ̆ 7 s trustee, appointed {{for the protection of}} all the creditors of the bankrupt entity, uses the fraudulent conveyance provision of the Code to have any asset transfers that were made to the bank subsidiary returned to the debtor 2 ̆ 7 s estate. The good faith exception to that provision will protect the asset transfer only if the parent company made the transfer for “good and fair consideration. ” The banking laws govern the regulation of the entire banking industry, including the insolvency of a financial institution. The banking laws, arguably, provide preferential treatment for the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund as a failed financial institution 2 ̆ 7 s potentially largest unsecured creditor. Banking law allows the parent company to make an asset transfer to avoid the threat of mandated restrictions. It also gives an unfulfilled payment a priority status in bankruptcy. The rules do not state, however, under what circumstances an unfunded capital obligation ought to be allowed. The legality of the asset transfer when a parent company seeks bankruptcy protection is a crucial question for the banking industry. Part II of the article identifies the statutory basis for the dormant conflict between Titles 11 and 12. Specifically, this section lists the broad array of somewhat identical discretionary powers that both the bankruptcy court and the banking regulatory agencies have as trustee and receiver for insolvent corporations and financial institutions, respectively. Part II concludes with an analysis of the cases in which these discretionary powers of the trustee and the receiver have come into conflict. Part III discusses the bankruptcy of the Bank of New England Corporation (BNEC). The factual history of this case provides an example of the types of legal issues that an insolvent holding company faces under the banking laws when it files for protection under the Bankruptcy Code. The section ends by specifying post-BNE legislative reforms designed to address issues raised during the liquidation of that failed enterprise. Part IV identifies the statutory rights that creditors have under the fraudulent conveyance law, including the good faith exception. Finally, Part V proposes an amendment to the current regulatory scheme that would require asset transfers from an insolvent holding company. It posits that the policies supporting the good faith exception are not compromised by the concomitant goal of protecting the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund. The banking enterprise exception establishes a procedure for regulatory assets transfers that is reviewable by the bankruptcy court, and operates as a credit against <b>cross-guarantee</b> liability. The proposed change will more closely merge the policies and purposes of the two schemes that converge when a bank holding company becomes insolvent...|$|E
