40|$|We {{tested the}} extent of {{emancipation}} of the Whistle-shake display of male shelducks, Tadorna tadorna, from causal factors controlling its presumed evolutionary precursor, the Body-shake, a <b>comfort</b> <b>movement.</b> Both motor patterns show similarities in form and alternate in a yearly rhythm. First, in an artificial rain experiment, we analysed {{the influence of a}} stimulus controlling comfort movements. In spring almost exclusively Whistle-shakes were induced {{even in the absence of}} social stimuli, while in summer the birds performed predominantly Body-shakes. This is probably related to the seasonal production of sex hormones. Second, we tested the influence of social stimuli by confronting shelducks with displaying and non-displaying males. During moult when males almost exclusively perform Body-shakes we found no influence of social stimulation on the frequency or form of shakes. However, an effect of social stimulation was found in a period when the drakes gradually replace the Body-shake by the Whistle-shake which is after moult in autumn. In this experiment, birds were confronted with either an empty cage (control), artificial rain, a non-displaying or a displaying male conspecific. In relation to the control situation the birds performed more Whistle-shakes when stimulated socially and more Body-shakes when stimulated with artificial rain. The extent to which both shaking patterns share the same causal factors is discussed. (C) 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|E
40|$|This paper focusses on the {{phenomenon}} of emancipation in the Whistle-shake, an epigamic display of male shelducks. A comparison with other motor patterns and vocalizations indicates, that the Whistle-shake {{is a combination of}} the <b>comfort</b> <b>movement</b> Body-shake, with integrated elements of another display: Bill-tipping with trill. Between Whistle-shake and Body-shake almost no differences exist in total duration, duration of the sub-units they have in common, and in the number of shaking elements. Artificial rain experiments revealed that the Whistle-shake is not emancipated from the original causal factor, typically influencing the present occurrence of the Body-shake: All males predominantly produced Whistle-shakes when sprayed with water. In addition social factors influence the occurrence of the Whistle-shake. The percentage of shakes consisting of a Whistle-shake was higher in dominant than in subdominant birds. Furthermore, by confronting territorial pairs in spring with either a whistle-shaking or a body-shaking male or an empty neighbouring cage we found that the whistle-shaking male released more Whistle-shakes in the test-males than the body-shaking male. In contrast the test-females, which predominantly produced Body-shakes, did not show any changes in their shaking behaviour in response to the different shaking stimuli presented. Therefore {{it seems likely that the}} Whistle-shake and the Body-shake share causal comfort factors but differ in their sensitivity for social stimuli. Context analyses demonstrate that the Whistle-shake shows a sequential association with aggression in dominant males and with escape behaviour in subdominant males. Therefore, the occurrence of the Whistle-shake is not restricted to a specific balance between the activation of motivational systems for aggression and fear. The dual function of the Whistle-shake (comfort and social function) is discussed. ...|$|E

The Gravity-Loading Countermeasure Skinsuit (GLCS) has been devised to comfortably compress the body via incrementally increasing longitudinal elastic-fibre tensions from the shoulders to the feet. We tested whether the Mk III GLCS was a feasible adjunct to sub-maximal aerobic exercise and resulting VO 2 Max predictions. Eight healthy subjects (5 ♂, 28 ± 6 yr) performed cycle ergometry at 75 % VO 2 Max (derived from an Astrand-Rhyming protocol) whilst wearing a GLCS and gym clothing (GYM). Ventilatory parameters, heart rate (H R), core temperature (T C), and blood lactate (B L) were recorded along with subjective perceived exertion, thermal <b>comfort,</b> <b>movement</b> discomfort and body control. Physiological and subjective responses were compared over TIME and between GYM and GLCS (ATTIRE) with 2 -way repeated measures ANOVA and Wilcoxon tests respectively. Resultant VO 2 Max predictions were compared with paired t-tests between ATTIRE. The GLCS induced greater initial exercise ventilatory responses which stabilised by 20 min. H R and T C continued to rise from 5 min irrespective of ATTIRE, whereas B L was greater in the GLCS at 20 min. Predicted VO 2 Max did not differ with ATTIRE, though some observed differences in H R were noteworthy. All subjective ratings were exacerbated in the GLCS. Despite increased perception of workload and initial ventilatory augmentations, submaximal exercise performance was not impeded. Whilst predicted VO 2 Max did not differ, determination of actual VO 2 Max in the GLCS is warranted due to apparent modulation of the linear H R -VO 2 relationship. The GLCS may be a feasible adjunct to exercise and potential countermeasure to unloaded-induced physiological deconditioning on Earth or in space...|$|E

40|$|Sexual {{displays}} of the Musk Duck and Blue-billed Duck are described and illustrated. The {{displays of}} male Musk Ducks comprise {{a series of}} three forms exhibiting increasing ritualization, complexity, and time-interval constancy. All of them have conspicuous auditory characteristics as well as variously conspicuous visual features. Displays in the species appear to have evolved under the influence of intense sexual selection resulting from what is probably a more completely promiscuous mating system than occurs in any other species of Anatidae. These selective pressures have also probably promoted the evolution of such features as large size and extreme sexual dimorphism that distinguish the genus Biziura from the typical stiff-tails (Oxyura). Displays in the Blue-billed Duck likewise embody a combination of auditory and visual characteristics, and include a large number of variably ritualized postures, several of which are clearly derived from <b>comfort</b> <b>movements</b> or intention movements.

40|$|A {{behavioral}} bioassay {{was used}} to compare the separate toxic effects of sublethal concentrations of methyl parathion, copper sulfate and chlordane on bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus. Ten behaviors were monitored in bluegill hierarchies before and after toxicant introductions. These behaviors encompassed respiratory disruptions, changes in <b>comfort</b> <b>movements</b> and aggression. Hyperactivity and increased frequencies of s-jerks and fin flicks were significant (P (LESSTHEQ) 0. 05) in fish exposed to the lowest methyl parathion concentration (0. 003 mg/L) used. Respiratory disruptions were significantly (P (LESSTHEQ) 0. 01) elevated in bluegill exposed to as low as 0. 034 mg/L copper sulfate while chlordane (0. 00015 mg/L) produced increased aggression. The most dominant and most subordinate fish were more affected in every concentration of each of the three chemicals used than intermediately ranked hierarchy members. This differential response suggests that there is a combined effect due to social stress and toxicant stress. Social hierarchies develop as mechanisms to efficiently ration limited resources among individuals of a population. Low levels of methyl parathion, copper sulfate and chlordane could affect hierarchy function which might ultimately disrupt population dynamics under natural conditions...|$|R
40|$|Fin {{flickering}} {{was defined}} as rapid movements of the fins. The behavioral function of such movements is however not well established. Depending on the species investigated, they were considered as <b>comfort</b> <b>movements</b> (e. g. removal of minor irritations) or alarm for young. In the cichlid Etroplus maculatus they allow homogenous repartition of eggs on the substrate. We studied visual and acoustical behavior of five Ophthalmotilapia ventralis (two males and three females) reared in a 240 l tank. Pectoral fin flickering associated with sound production was often observed, especially from fish that established a territory. With {{the exception of the}} butterflish Chaetodon mutlicinctus and gouramis, this aspect of fin flickering is generally overlooked in teleosts. First observations support the fact that sounds (peak frequency and pulse duration: 562 ± 95 Hz and 14 ± 5 ms, respectively) are not emitted during all kinds of fin movements but mainly during some caudo-rostral horizontal fin sweeps.

40|$|My {{thesis is}} an attempt to {{understand}} the local-transnational dynamic of the Korean <b>Comfort</b> Women <b>movement.</b> Rather than understanding it simply as a single transnational movement as is commonly referred to in current scholarship on the movement, I intend to contribute to the literature on the issue by suggesting that there are two parallel movements on the issue in Korea - the national and the transnational - which are discordant in nature. For the Korean activists, researchers and feminist leaders advocating for the Comfort Women issue, the emergence of the human rights principles as a core value in the post Cold War period was significant. The movement has aligned itself with the global movement for the elimination of violence against women during armed conflict paradigm which has provided much of the theoretical framework for the transnational campaigning for the Comfort Women issue. This thesis draws on frame theory and Transnational Advocacy Network (TAN) theory to study how movement actors are actively engaged in the process of framing the Comfort Women issue to maximize mobilization of target audiences and the socio-cultural and political contextual constraints and. opportunities that influence this process and outcomes. At the transnational level, the Korean <b>Comfort</b> Women <b>movement</b> has been successful in 'framing' the movement within a human rights frame and has been successful in forming a 'transnational advocacy network' on the issue. The TAN presents a cohesive movement united by common values and discourse that share resources and information. It is argued that the cohesion displayed at the transnational level has been difficult to achieve in the domestic arena. Due to complex differential dynamics within the local actors, the domestic Korean <b>Comfort</b> Women <b>movement</b> is not united by a common 'frame' leading to a fragmented movement. This thesis argues that harmony between. the local and the transnational by means of a uniform master frame will ultimately lead to effective mobilization and resonance at the local and international level and put pressure for social and policy change at the government level...|$|R

40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} this {{meta-analysis}} was to evaluate patients' assessment of fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system (ITS) and morphine intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV PCA) ease of care (EOC) using a validated patient EOC questionnaire. Fentanyl ITS is a preprogrammed, needle-free PCA system used {{for the management of}} acute pain in postoperative patients. MethodsThis meta-analysis assessed the patient EOC of fentanyl ITS and morphine IV PCA using data from three randomized, active-comparator trials in adult postoperative patients with moderate-to-severe pain. All three studies utilized a validated patient EOC questionnaire which consists of 23 items grouped into seven subscales (confidence with device, <b>comfort</b> with device, <b>movement,</b> dosing confidence, pain control, knowledge/understanding, and satisfaction). Each item is scored on a six-point Likert scale. The weighted mean difference between treatments was calculated for the overall EOC and for each of the seven subscales. ResultsThe EOC analyses were based on responses to questionnaires from 1, 943 patients treated with either fentanyl ITS (n = 961) or morphine IV PCA (n = 982). There was a statistically significant advantage in favor of fentanyl ITS over morphine IV PCA in terms of overall EOC (weighted mean difference = 0. 28; 95 % confidence interval (0. 22 to 0. 34); P < 0. 0001). Five of the seven subscales (confidence with device, <b>comfort</b> with device, <b>movement,</b> dosing confidence, and knowledge/understanding) on the patient EOC questionnaire showed a statistically significant advantage for fentanyl ITS versus morphine IV PCA.

After thematic analysis - Collective Subject Discourse - positive aspects of the vertical position emerged, namely: greater <b>comfort,</b> freedom of <b>movement,</b> reduction of the expulsive effort, favors women's participation. Negative aspects were listed as discomfort and lack of obstetric intervention. Positive aspects of the horizontal position were reported as quickness, feelings of security and of being helped. Negative aspects were related to discomfort and difficulty in exerting strength. Positive aspects of the vertical position and negative aspects of the horizontal position stood out more intensely and frequently, and are in accordance with scientific evidence...|$|R

The standard-issue firearm of the British Army was the Land Pattern Musket. Some officers preferred their troops to fire careful, measured shots (around two per minute), rather than rapid firing. A bayonet made firing difficult, as its cumbersome shape hampered ramming down the charge into the barrel. British troops had a tendency to fire impetuously, resulting in inaccurate fire, a trait for which John Burgoyne criticized them during the Saratoga campaign. Burgoyne instead encouraged bayonet charges to break up enemy formations, which was a preferred tactic in most European armies at the time.|$|R
