40|$|An {{approach}} to the clustering problem with integer data is described, in which special sets of feature values not contained in the feature descriptions of objects are constructed. The problem is reduced to the construction <b>of</b> irredundant <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> integer matrices, which {{can be done by}} con-structing irreducible <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> Boolean matrices. Based on a geometric interpretation of the concept <b>of</b> <b>covering,</b> a new method is proposed for constructing irreducible and minimal <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> a Boolean matrix.

Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> natal down.

5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis {{differs from}} other boletes in the <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> the cap, which superficially resembles that {{found on the}} surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a {{somewhat}} conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown color, and the absence of a veil. Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan to brown with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. Boletus edulis is separated from A.mirabilis by the color and texture of the cap, tubes and stem. Boletus coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste. Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated {{blood from}} the brain. The brain has two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface of}} the cerebrum that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> the skull. Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.|$|E

Actual purification of the waste water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until March 2007, when two treatment stations were built, thus finally cleansing the Senne after centuries of problems.|$|E

5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E

5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage.

Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid clean-up. Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good management practice.|$|E
