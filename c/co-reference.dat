This is hampered {{by a lack}} of any means for managing and communicating <b>co-references.</b> We have therefore developed an ontology and framework for the exploration and resolution of potential <b>co-references,</b> in {{the semantic}} web at large, that allow the user to a) discover and record uniquely identifying attributes b) interface candidates with and create pipelines of other systems for reference management c) record identified duplicates in a usable and retrievable manner, and d) provide a consistent reference service for accessing them.

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{automatically}} recognize and enroll new vocabulary in a multimodal interface. To accomplish this our technique aims to leverage the mutually disambiguating aspects of <b>co-referenced,</b> co-temporal handwriting and speech. The <b>co-referenced</b> semantics are spatially and temporally determined by our multimodal interface for schedule chart creation. This paper motivates and describes our technique for recognizing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms and enrolling them dynamically in the system. We report results for the detection and segmentation of OOV words within a small multimodal test set. On the same test set we also report utterance, word and pronunciation level error rates both over individual input modes and multimodally. We show that combining information from handwriting and speech yields better results than achievable by either mode alone...|$|R

5000|$|The {{backward}} <b>co-reference</b> domain is a {{specification of}} the general concept of domain found in binding theory. For anaphors, domain {{is defined as the}} smallest XP node in a tree with a subject that contains the DP [...] Backward <b>co-reference</b> domain dictates that node X is in the backward <b>co-reference</b> domain of node Y if there are two further nodes, A and B, such that A predicates B, A dominates X, and B dominates Y [...] This specification is meant to account for cases where self-anaphors are free and possess consciousness, but are still unacceptable. [...] addresses the two crucial differences his Principle E holds with binding theory. First it operates distinctly in the backward <b>co-reference</b> domain, rather than the more general operation of c-command.This means that it operates in terms of both syntax and semantics, where c-command uses only syntactic relations. It is also sensitive to the attribution of consciousness, unlike the syntax-specific binding theory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Co-references</b> are {{traditionally}} used when integrating data from different datasets. This approach has various {{benefits such as}} fault tolerance, ease of integration and traceability of provenance; however, it often results in the problem of entity consolidation, i. e., of objectively stating whether all the <b>co-references</b> do really refer to the same entity; and, when this is the case, whether they all convey the same intended meaning. Relying on the sole presence of a single equivalence (owl:sameAs) statement is often problematic and sometimes may even cause serious troubles. It has been observed that to indicate the likelihood of an equivalence one could use a numerically weighted measure, but the real hard questions of where precisely these values come from arises. We propose and discuss an answer to this question...|$|R

50|$|In linguistics, coreference, {{sometimes}} written <b>co-reference,</b> {{occurs when}} {{two or more}} expressions in a text refer to the same person or thing; {{they have the same}} referent, e.g. Bill said he would come; the proper noun Bill and the pronoun he refer to the same person, namely to Bill. Coreference is the main concept underlying binding phenomena in the field of syntax. The theory of binding explores the syntactic relationship that exists between coreferential expressions in sentences and texts. When two expressions are coreferential, the one is usually a full form (the antecedent) and the other is an abbreviated form (a proform or anaphor). Linguists use indices to show coreference, as with the i index in the example Billi said hei would come. The two expressions with the same reference are coindexed, hence in this example Bill and he are coindexed, indicating that they should be interpreted as coreferential.|$|E

50|$|In Pada 32 of Book II Ch.IV of his Ashtadhyayi Pāṇini, who {{states that}} words apply per object, {{explains}} that: इदमोऽन्वादेशेऽशनुदात्त तृत्यादौ ||in {{the room of}} idam 'this', in case of its re-employment in a subsequent member of the same sentence and referring {{to the same thing}} (anvadesha i.e. adesha after re-employment) there is the substitution of as’ which is a anudatta i.e. gravely accented, when the third case-affix and the rest follow. That means - अ replaces इदम् in all cases except the nominative and the accusative. In this context Katayayana stipulates that one should specify a pronominal used in subsequently referring to something should be co-referential with a previously used term because replacement by an anaphoric pronoun should not possibly be allowed where there is not <b>co-reference.</b> And, with regard to taddhita affixation abstract patterns like tasya idam ('prescribing a genitive relationship'), tad asmin ('prescribing a locative relationship') and tat karoti ('prescribing an action meaning involving an accusative relationship') have been identified. The genitive form of idams is explained as a sthaneyoga sasthi (Pada I.i.49) and the locative form is explained as parasaptami when a case ending beginning with the instrumental case endings follows. A substitute which has s’ as an it-letter replaces the whole of the original form which step requires an anubandha.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{accounts}} of anaphor resolution propose a two-route architecture for {{the interpretation of}} pronominals (e. g., Grodzinsky & Reinhart, 1993; Reuland, 2001). A pronoun can either be resolved by a grammatical operation in logical syntax (i. e., variable binding) or through value assignment in discourse (i. e., <b>co-reference).</b> Reuland (2001) proposes that an interpretation through variable binding requires less processing resources and is therefore preferred over a <b>co-reference</b> interpretation. Rule I compares variable binding with <b>co-reference</b> interpretations to decide whether a <b>co-reference</b> dependency is allowed (Grodzinsky & Reinhart, 1993; Reinhart 2000). This rule prevents discourse processes from by-passing logical syntax where the latter rules out an interpretation as ungrammatical. The question is whether Rule I always compares variable binding with <b>co-reference</b> interpretations, or is only executed if a dependency is initially ruled out by logical syntax. In an eye-tracking experiment we manipulated the interpretation of ambiguous and unambiguous pronouns {{in an attempt to}} explore how variable binding, <b>co-reference</b> and Rule I influence the way readers resolve pronouns. The results show that if a pronoun was ambiguous between a variable binding and <b>co-reference</b> antecedent, the variable binding antecedent was initially preferred even if discourse information clearly favoured the <b>co-reference</b> antecedent. Therefore, we argue that logical syntactic processes function independently from discourse processes, indicating that it may be warranted to consider logical syntax and discourse as distinct modules of the language system. Furthermore, the language system does not seem to apply Rule I in cases where both variable binding and <b>co-reference</b> lead to the same grammatical interpretation suggesting that Rule I is only relevant in cases that are potentially ungrammatical...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{the context}} of a {{possibilistic}} framework for detection of object <b>co-reference,</b> evaluators have been defined as operators that compare two values and express the belief that such values are co-referent. Hereby, <b>co-reference</b> of two values means that these values describe the same entity in the real world. In this paper, a class of evaluators is investigated that determines the belief of <b>co-reference</b> based on semantical connections between values of the universe. These semantical connections are modeled by means of binary relations. In case these binary relations are not a-priori given, they can be (partially) learned in an iterative <b>co-reference</b> detection schema...|$|E
