5000|$|A cabinet mat is a mat made {{of rubber}} that protects kitchen cabinets, more {{particularly}} kitchen <b>sink</b> base <b>cabinets,</b> from leaks, water damage, mold and household item spills that commonly {{occur in the}} kitchen <b>sink</b> <b>cabinet.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Present-day {{machines}} {{feature a}} drop-down front panel door, allowing {{access to the}} interior, which usually contains two or sometimes three pull-out racks; racks can also {{be referred to as}} [...] "baskets". In older U.S. models from the 1950s, the entire tub rolled out when the machine latch was opened, and loading/removing washable items was from the top, with the user reaching deep into the compartment for some items. Youngstown Kitchens, which manufactured entire kitchen <b>cabinets</b> and <b>sinks,</b> offered a tub-style dishwasher, which was coupled to a conventional kitchen sink as one unit.|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} apparatus {{included the}} low-frequency vibrating oil extraction equipment (designed by the Physical & Eco-Chemical Technology and Engineering Center for Complex Hydrocarbon Reservoir Stimulation), Brookfield DV-III type rotational viscometer, thermostat water bath, thermometer, and unconsolidated sand pack, etc. The low-frequency vibrating oil extraction equipment {{was composed of}} vibrostand (including the vibration table and pedestal), vibration exciter, power amplifier, control <b>cabinet</b> and heat <b>sink.</b>|$|R
50|$|Parker Manufacturing Company was {{a machine}} shop during World War II, a {{manufacturer}} of machine tools, a manufacturer/distributor of metal kitchen <b>cabinets</b> and <b>sinks,</b> and an industrial landlord, in Santa Monica, CA. The company designed and manufactured a unique sheet-metal shear (a large machine tool for cutting sheet steel) {{and was able to}} provide delivery in only 30 days, when other manufacturers were taking two years to make deliveries due to wartime production backlogs. It also designed and manufactured a unique sheet-metal press. Regarded as the most versatile press ever built, the Multi-Max press performed multiple operations (which previously had required multiple machines) in a compact amount of production-line space which was unprecedented.|$|R
40|$|A task-oriented space {{can benefit}} from an {{augmented}} reality interface that layers the existing tools and surfaces with useful information to make cooking more easy, safe and efficient. To serve experienced users as well as novices, augmented reality interfaces need to adapt modalities to the userâ€™s expertise and allow for multiple ways to perform tasks. We present a framework for designing an intelligent user interface that informs and choreographs multiple tasks in a single space according to a model of tasks and users. A residential kitchen has been outfitted with systems to gather data from tools and surfaces and project multi-modal interfaces back onto the tools and surfaces themselves. Based on user evaluations of this augmented reality kitchen, we propose a system to tailor information modalities based on the spatial and temporal qualities of the task, and the expertise, location and progress of the user. The intelligent augmented reality user interface choreographs multiple tasks in the same space at the same time. Anywhere Projector augments reality by projecting interfaces on any surface in a single room [4]. We have shown a variety of interfaces projected onto the objects and surfaces of the kitchen can aid in the task of cooking, communicating and orienting tasks [2]. We built an augmented reality kitchen where simple sensing and projection augment the refrigerator, cook-top, <b>cabinets,</b> <b>sink</b> and drawers (see Figure 1) [1]. User evaluations of this environment reveal problems that the CounterActive and Anywhere Projector models have limited interface modalities and are inflexible in their approach to tasks. A single recipe can be performed {{in a number of}} different ways, especially by users of varied experience. Information projection benefits every step if the interface modalities are carefully tailored to the location, expertise and performance of the user(s) ...|$|R
50|$|The Frankfurt {{kitchen was}} a narrow double-file kitchen {{measuring}} 1.9 x 3.4 m. The entrance {{was located in}} one of the short walls, opposite which was the window. Along the left side, the stove was placed, followed by a sliding door connecting the kitchen to the dining and living room. On the right wall were <b>cabinets</b> and the <b>sink,</b> {{in front of the window}} a workspace. There was no refrigerator, but there was a foldable ironing board visible in the image folded against the left wall.|$|R
50|$|The office {{consists}} of a small entry foyer with reception desk, three offices, a kitchen, and a strong room. Rooms have vinyl tile floors, sheet wall linings with timber skirtings, picture rails and architraves, and the ceiling is fibrous plaster sheets with moulded plaster cornices. The strong room has a concrete floor and rendered concrete walls and ceiling. The rooms retain original built-in cupboards with original hardware, some original light fixtures and light switching plates, and the strong room retains original locks and timber shelving. Internal doors are timber with original hardware. Some windows have internal wind deflecting glass shields at sill level and some partitions have ribbed glass windows at a high level. The foyer retains the original timber veneer reception desk {{in front of a}} timber veneer partition with ribbed glazing. The kitchen retains original joinery including <b>cabinet</b> handles, <b>sink</b> and tapware, benchtop, and green splashback tiles.|$|R

Magnet Trade also supplies {{organizations in the}} RSL sector such as Local Authorities and Housing Associations. Alongside a comprehensive kitchen offering (<b>cabinets,</b> appliances, worktops, <b>sinks</b> & taps), the company supplies {{a wide variety of}} joinery (Doors, Windows, Timber, Wood flooring, Hardware). Products are supplied from stock held on site in the branch warehouse. Free kitchen planning, made to measure timber window ordering and local delivery services are also offered.|$|R
5000|$|As {{she starts}} doing the task, it becomes evident that {{she starts to}} lose focus and start seeing things. Like {{pictures}} of the same person on a plate (when removed by plate the picture starts to get smaller), notices her two sons in unusual places (one dancing on a table; the other inside the <b>cabinet</b> below the <b>sink,</b> then in the sink), throwing items from her purse {{into the water and}} also washes them (including Barbara Cartland's novel [...] "Shotgun Wedding"). She discovers a bald person who looks like her and tries to push them back into the sink and as she drains the water she also fights with it by using a bouquet of roses.|$|R
50|$|The {{windows were}} {{provided}} with counterweights and retractable fly screens and could be lowered down into the wall opening as in a railway carriage. A factory built steel wall, which included the water and waste water pipes, was installed between the kitchen and bathroom with the particularity that the bathtub of the narrow bathroom protruded through the wall to save space in the <b>cabinet</b> of the <b>sink.</b> Closets were used to build the remaining interior walls. The quality of the MAN steel houses proved to be excellent {{in comparison to the}} competition of that time. Due to the good thermal insulation, the hot-dip galvanized components and the heat treated paints, there were very little corrosion and condensation problems.|$|R
5000|$|Electrotettix is an extinct genus of pygmy locust {{found in}} amber {{collected}} in the Dominican Republic. Represented by a single species, Electrotettix attenboroughi, which lived 18-20 million years ago, it fed primarily on moss, fungi, and algae. [...] The genus name is derived from , Latin for [...] "amber", and Greek , meaning [...] "grasshopper". [...] The species was named after Sir David Attenborough. [...] The female measures 8 millimeters in length: the male is unknown. The species is distinguished from modern members of the Cladonotinae subfamily {{by the fact that}} it retains vestigial wings, a feature lost somewhere between the ancient specimens and more modern species. [...] E. attenboroughi was identified from a collection of amber at the Illinois Natural History Survey, which had been stored in a <b>cabinet</b> under a <b>sink</b> since it was {{collected in the}} 1950s by entomologist Milton Sanderson.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} has two large separate {{male and female}} washrooms on each floor and a small kitchenette/study lounge. The lounge includes such items as a microwave, <b>sink,</b> <b>cabinets,</b> and study cubicles, {{as well as a}} dining room table. All rooms are equipped with twin-sized single mattresses and large dressers, bookshelves, and a wooden desk with a lamp. Some of the triple rooms contain new furniture including bunk beds, smaller but more spacious desks and cabinets. Outside of the rooms, the residence has areas for recreation and student entertainment. The most popular area, known as the [...] "Tower Lounge", allows for large-scale activities to take place, such as billiards, ping pong, cooking, television set with couches, meeting areas, study tables, and vending machines. The residence has laundry facilities, fully equipped with washers and dryers, which are card operated. For students with music interests, there is a piano room available located on the fourth floor, in the North wing.|$|R
60|$|The {{decision}} was persistently regarded by Mr. Gladstone {{as an important}} event in English political history. With {{a small number of}} distinguished individual exceptions, it marked the withdrawal from the liberal party of the aristocratic element. Up to a very recent date this had been its governing element. Until 1868, the whig nobles and their connections held the reins and shaped the policy. After the accession of a leader from outside of the caste in 1868, when Mr. Gladstone for the first time became prime minister, they continued to hold more than their share of the offices, but in <b>cabinet</b> they <b>sank</b> to the position of what is called a moderating force. After 1880 it became every day more clear that even this modest function was slipping away. Lord Hartington found that the moderating force could no longer moderate. If he went on, he must make up his mind to go under the Caudine forks once a week. The significant reference, among his reasons for not joining the new ministry, to the concessions that he had made in the last government for the sake of party unity, and to his feeling that any further moves of the same kind for the same purpose would destroy all public confidence in him, shows just as the circumstances of the election had shown, and as the recent debate on the Collings amendment had shown, how small were the chances, quite apart from Irish policy, of uniting whig and radical wings in any durable liberal government.|$|R

It {{is the story of}} a man named Jason who one day (after dropping his wife Akiko off at the airport to visit friends) decides to crawl into the <b>cabinet</b> underneath his <b>sink.</b> He doesnâ€™t quite understand why he crawls under the sink, just that it is something that he needs to do. Before he realizes it, he is starving and too weak to get back out. When he feels as though he is about to disappear forever, he finds himself in a large cavern. After exploring the cavern he relives a memory from his childhood where he almost drowned in the Uji River. Then he is pulled out from under the sink by his wife. After his recovery he begins to realize that the world he left when he went under the bathroom sink and the world he came back to are not the same. Creative WritingDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

50|$|The Main Building: This is {{the largest}} {{building}} of the school, {{and the most important}} since it contains most of the major offices. It shares with other buildings the infirmary and the cafeteria. This is also where classes and most activities for primary and secondary 1, 2 and 3 students are held. Secondary 1 and 2 boarding girls reside in a large dormitory on the 4th floor of this building, each having an individual cubicle, furnished with a small dressing cabinet and a single bed. Secondary 3, 4 and 5 boarding girls have individual/shared rooms, which are also located on the 4th floor of the building, but separated from the younger girls.The Querbes Building: This is the building dedicated to the classrooms of secondary 4 and 5 studentsâ€”the seniors. In order to separate the boarding girls and boys, all boys, from secondary 1 to 5, live in this building. There is normally one boys in a medium-sized room, with one bed, a table, <b>cabinets</b> and a <b>sink.</b> (It used to be two students per room, but due to recent renovations and creation of new rooms, it's back to one)The Sports Building: College Bourget is known for its sports activities. It has three gymnasia, an ice-skating arena, a fully equipped physical training room,a climbing wall and a semi-Olympic-size pool. The campus also features the following outdoor facilities: baseball fields, recreation yards, a football field, two soccer field and two tennis courts.|$|R
5000|$|Group Challenge: The Kitchen Continues - Right off the top, Matt assigns four {{tasks to}} each of the others: Deen is to finish the diamond plating he has been working on for several episodes, Simon is to build and attach the <b>sink</b> <b>cabinet</b> doors, Angela is to finish cutting tiles for the Delta Upsilon emblem, while Cory is to install a new range hood. Cory does not read the {{instructions}} all the way, and installs the range hood too high (as Ontario building codes set a maximum height difference between stove top and range hood); to compensate, he decides to build a platform. Deen diverts some of his time to assist Matt in plumbing the dishwasher, as he wants {{to learn how to do}} plumbing back home. He is then tasked to finish the remainder of the plumbing while Matt himself switches gears to tiling with Angela. The tile job proves to be difficult due to Matt using too much adhesive, making a mess out of the [...] "Delta" [...] tiles in the Delta Upsilon logo as the adhesive comes up between the tiles. Matt's demand for perfection, however, meant that he wants to start the tile job over. As for Simon's task, he takes over 90 minutes in repeatedly installing and uninstalling doors that do not fit due to the openings being unlevel and not plumb. In the end, none of the major tasks are completed.|$|R
5000|$|Kitchens today. Modern kitchen {{design has}} {{improved}} {{partly as a}} result of ergonomic research. Functionality is important; one research study had [...] "anthropological scientists" [...] observing homeowners [...] "interact" [...] with their kitchen cabinets. Kitchens are larger and have more cabinets; some kitchens may have as many as fifty drawers and cabinet doors. New features today include deep drawers for cookware, pull-out shelves to avoid excess bending, sponge trays on the front of <b>sink</b> <b>cabinets,</b> pullout hideaway garbage/recycling containers, pull-out spice cabinets, lazy susans in corner cabinets, vertical storage for cookie sheets, full-extension drawer slides, and drawers and doors with so-called soft-close/positive-close mechanisms enabling drawers to shut quietly, or which shut fully after being pushed only partially. As housing stocks get older, many homeowners face problems with visually unappealing older kitchen cabinets; in such situations, there is a choice to buy new (most expensive), reface existing (less expensive), or to strip and refinish existing (least expensive if done by the homeowner) cabinets. By 2009, there was more emphasis on cabinets designed with environmental factors in mind. So-called [...] "green cabinets" [...] were becoming more popular. As homes in Western countries became more airtight to save on heating and cooling costs, air quality has sometimes suffered as gases which are released from resins as they cure. Resins, organic materials which convert from liquid to solid form, are used to manufacture engineered wood (e.g., particleboard) frequently used to build kitchen cabinet carcases can be a factor.

40|$|Introduction: Possible {{contamination}} in nuclear medicine centers, {{in addition to}} health problems, affect the tests and much effort and cost is required for decontamination. Given the effects of ionizing radiation on human health, rules and regulations have been enacted to avoid contamination, that in working with radioactive materials should be followed to minimize them.. Material and Method: After mapping of nuclear medicine centers in the province, areas that should be studied for measuring the amount of radioactive contamination were determined. The site selection for the tests {{were based on the}} area in which the possibility of further contamination were existance. After measuring the background count rate the radioactive {{contamination in}} studied areas were performed using Wipe Test.. Result: The mean level of background contamination in centers 1, 2 and 3 were 1. 75 Â± 0. 150 Î¼Ci, 4. 43 Â± 0. 615 Î¼Ci and 2. 47 Â± 0. 055 Î¼Ci, respectively. In center 1, only region of Hood pollution was much higher than the permissible limit. In center 2, radioactive contamination of the waiting room, patient rooms, warehouse radiotracer, control room, hood, desk and floor center was exceeded. Also, in center 3, contamination of the doorway, hallway patients, control room, hood, desk, <b>sink,</b> <b>cabinets,</b> room and floor imaging injection (control), respectively, were higher than the permissible limits.. Conclusion: In centers 1 and 2, most of the radioactive contamination occurred under the hood due to labeling of radiopharmaceuticals activity. Also, in center 3, the highest contamination rate belonged to patientsâ€™ corridor that could be due to frequent the area. According to this subject, necessary measures in this regard should be considered by the department responsible for health physics...|$|R
