40|$|Background: Fibroblast {{growth factors}} 1 and 2 (FGF 1 and FGF 2), potent mitogens for endothelial cells and {{vascular}} smooth cells, are implicated in arterial and capillary growth {{as well as}} in cardioprotection. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP 1) is involved in various inflammatory conditions. Utilizing transgenic mice (TG) overexpressing FGF 1, FGF 2, or MCP 1 and nontransgenic controls (NTG), the effects of these factors on vascular development, cellular protection, cardiac performance, and exercise tolerance were studied. Methods: 1. Ventricular cardiac myocytes of hearts of FGF 1 TG and NTG were isolated and submitted to simulated ischemia and reoxygenation. The releases of CK and LDH were quantified. 2. The coronary flow of the hearts of FGF 1 TG and NTG was quantified utilizing ex vivo retrograde perfusion under maximal vasodilation at four different pressures. 3. Right femoral arteries of FGF 2 TG and NTG were occluded. Mice were assigned to a sedentary or a trained group. After 5 weeks, <b>collateral</b> dependent <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> to the foot and to the gastrocnemius muscle were determined. Exercise capacity was accessed, postmortem angiograms and histomorphometry of collateral arteries were performed. 4. Exercise tolerance of MCP 1 TG and NTG was determined by graded exercise tests over a period of four months. 5. The relationship between recovery of exercise capacity and increase in <b>collateral</b> dependent <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> after bilateral femoral artery occlusion was investigated in three different mouse strains. Results: 1. CK and LDH release of myocytes of FGF 1 TG was reduced at 4 h and 8 h of simulated ischemia. 2. The pressure dependent increase in coronary flow was markedly elevated in hearts of FGF 1 TG. 3. Foot and gastrocnemius <b>blood</b> <b>flows</b> as well as exercise capacity were increased in trained FGF 2 TG that showed the formation of a dense collateral network. 4. Exercise tolerance of MCP 1 TG was markedly reduced. 5. Increased <b>collateral</b> dependent foot <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> is only partially reflected by the recovery of exercise capacity. Conclusions: Cardiac-specific FGF 1 overexpression protects ventricular myocytes against simulated ischemia and increases coronary flow. General FGF 2 overexpression and training enhance the formation of a dense collateral network, increase <b>collateral</b> dependent <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> and exercise capacity.

Advantages are that the technique has been successful in the treatment of pseudoaneurysms for many years. However, it is more invasive (a large skin incision is necessary), and there is more postoperative pain and a risk for wound infection. One of the less invasive options may be preferred in a patient with many comorbidities, who is at high risk for surgery.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the applicability of a pressure-flow equation for quantitative calculation of recruitable <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> at coronary artery occlusion in conscious patients and to investigate the value of that index to predict future ischemic events. Background. Recent experimental studies have indicated that recruitable <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> at coronary artery occlusion can be expressed as a fraction of normal maximal myocardial blood flow by simultaneous recordings of mean arterial, coronary wedge and central venous pressures, respectively. This index is called the pressure-derived fractional collateral flow and is independent of hemodynamic loading conditions. Methods. In 120 patients undergoing elective coronary angioplasty, mean arterial, coronary wedge and central venous pressures were measured at balloon inflations of 2 min. All patients had a recent exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) with positive findings showing clearly distinguishable, reversible ECG abnormalities, enabling recognition of ischemia at balloon inflation. Fractional <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> at angioplasty was calculated by coronary wedge pressure minus central venous pressure divided by mean arterial pressure minus central venous pressure and correlated to {{the presence or absence of}} ischemia at balloon inflation. Ischemic events were monitored during a follow-up period of 6 to 22 months. Results. In 90 of the 120 patients, ischemia was present at balloon inflation, and in 82 of these patients, fractional <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was ≤ 23 %. By contrast, in 29 patients, no ischemia was present, and fractional <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was > 24 % in all 29. During the follow-up period, 16 patients had an ischemic event. Fifteen of these 16 patients were in the group with insufficient collateral flow (p < 0. 05). Conclusions. To our knowledge, this study presents the first method for quantitative assessment of recruitable <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in humans in the catheterization laboratory. Sufficient and insufficient collateral circulation can be reliably distinguished by this method. Use of this method can also help to provide more insight into the extent and behavior of the collateral circulation for investigational purposes and may have potential clinical implications...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Preoperative {{measurements}} of <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> {{in patients with}} triple vessel disease and chronic occlusions of the right coronary artery do not, currently, ascertain the need to revascularise an occluded right coronary artery. We performed direct {{measurements of}} flow across left coronary bypass grafts to determine their contributions to <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> METHODS: <b>Collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was scored preoperatively according to Rentrop in 13 patients with triple vessel disease and chronic occlusions of the right coronary artery who underwent complete, off-pump, surgical revascularisation. The transit-time flow through the left coronary grafts was measured before and after unclamping of the right {{coronary artery bypass graft}}. RESULTS: Unclamping of the right coronary artery bypass graft was associated with a 5. 9 +/- 6. 9 ml/min (mean+/-SD) decrease in flow across the left circumflex territory (P= 0. 009), which was proportional to the preoperative Rentrop score (P= 0. 007). No significant change was observed in flow across the graft to the left anterior descending artery. CONCLUSIONS: Grafts to the left circumflex system are the only grafts that supply a significant, albeit modest amount of <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to chronically occluded right coronary artery. These observations confirm that (1) most collateral flow after revascularisation is supplied by the native network, and (2) revascularisation of an occluded right coronary artery is fully justified...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The {{evolution}} of myocardial infarction 24 hours after ligating both the right coronary artery and the obtuse marginal {{branch of the}} left circumflex coronary artery was examined in 33 anesthetized dogs. Postmortem coronary angiography and a tracer microsphere technique {{were used to determine}} risk areas and their <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flows,</b> respectively. The mean weight of the risk areas was 11. 3 ± 0. 5 g (mean ± SEM) in the right ventricle and 10. 5 ± 0. 9 g in the left ventricle (NS). The weight of infarcted tissue was 5. 7 ± 0. 7 g in the right ventricle and 5. 2 ± 0. 9 g in the left ventricle (NS). In both ventricles, infarct weight was linearly related to risk area size, and the percent of risk area necrosis was inversely correlated with the extent of collateral flow at 24 hours of coronary ligation, defined as the mean myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> inside the central risk area. Ratios of infarct to risk area between the subendocardial and subepicardial layers were 0. 76 ± 0. 06 and 0. 28 ± 0. 05 in the right and left ventricles, respectively (p < 0. 01, between ventricles, n = 31), which coincided well with subendocardial-to-subepicardial-flow ratios at 24 hours, ie, 0. 86 ± 0. 04 in the right ventricle and 0. 32 ± 0. 06 in the left ventricle (p < 0. 01).

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Occlusion of the {{anterior}} third of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) is generally well tolerated because of sufficient <b>collateral</b> venous <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> In contrast, the pathophysiologic effects of occlusion of the SSS posterior to the rolandic vein remain controversial. We aimed {{to identify the}} specific hemodynamic effects of this subtype of SSS occlusion. METHODS: We ligated the SSS just behind rolandic vein and in the posterior part near the confluens sinus in three anesthetized cats. Regional cerebral <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (rCBF) was measured before and at 2 and 24 hours after the SSS occlusion. At around 48 hours, experimental settings were terminated with perfusion fixation with 4 % paraformaldehyde solution. Hematoxylin-eosin histologic evaluation was performed. RESULTS: In all three cats with SSS occlusion, rCBF was reduced over the time period of measurement; this finding was observed in areas covering 5 – 20 % of the brain in planes affected by the occlusion. The degree of rCBF reduction and the extension and severity of histologically proved venous infarction were correlated.

40|$|Background Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen that is angiogenic in vitro and in vivo. It has been {{hypothesized}} that VEGE {{plays a role}} in myocardial collateral formation; however, the effects of VEGF on collateral flow to ischemic myocardium are unknown. Methods and Results We studied the effect of VEGF on <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in dogs subjected to gradual occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx). Beginning 10 days after placement of an LCx-constricting device, VEGF 45,ug (n= 9) or saline (n = 12) was administered daily via an indwell-ing catheter in the distal LCx, at a point just beyond the occlusion. Treatment was maintained for 28 days. <b>Collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was determined with microspheres 7 days before treatment, immediately before treatment (day 0), and 7, 14, 21, and 28 days into the treatment period. <b>Collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was quantified during chromonar-induced maximal vasodila-tion and expressed as a collateral zone/normal zone (CZINZ) ratio. Treatment with VEGF was associated with a 40 % increase in <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> (final CZ/NZ blood flow ratios of 0. 49 + 0. 06 and 0. 35 ± 0. 02 in the VEGF-treated and control groups, respectively, P=. 0037) as well as an 89 % increase in the numerical density of intramyocardial distribution vessels (> 20,um diameter) in the CZ (6. 6 ± 1. 4 versus 3. 5 ± 0. 7 vessels/ mmn in VEGF-treated and control dogs, respectively, P<. 05).

SETTING: Referral centre for cardiology at an academic hospital. PATIENTS: Nine patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and 17 with primary pulmonary hypertension.

Bronchopulmonary <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was estimated by injecting indocyanine green into the ascending aorta and sampling below the mitral valve from the left ventricle. RESULTS: The degree of pulmonary hypertension was comparable in the two groups. Large bronchopulmonary collaterals were visualised in all the patients with thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension who had bronchial arteriography or aortography or both. None of the primary pulmonary hypertension group studied by aortography had bronchopulmonary collaterals (P < < 0. 001). All the patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension had significant bronchopulmonary <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> which was (mean (SD)) 29. 8 (18. 6) % of the systemic blood flow.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Chronic {{stimulation}} of a cardiomyoplasty was combined with low-dose infusion of heparin into the arterial {{supply of the}} cardiomyoplasty {{in order to determine}} if latissimus-derived <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> could be further enhanced. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Acute and chronic {{stimulation of}} a latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty increased extramyocardial <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to 35 +/- 9 % and 27 +/- 5 %, respectively, of normal myocardial blood flow. METHODS: A model of coronary artery disease was created with an ameroid constrictor in goats, and a cardiomyoplasty was performed. Heparin (15 to 50 U/h) was delivered into the left subclavian artery for a period of 4 weeks. Simultaneously, the latissimus dorsi was chronically stimulated at 2 Hz. RESULTS: Chronic ischemic myocardium received a collateral flow per gram from the skeletal muscle equivalent to 11. 8 +/- 5. 2 % of the blood flow to normal myocardium. The extramyocardial collateral flow correlated with the latissimus muscle flow (r = 0. 72). CONCLUSIONS: Enhancement of extramyocardial collateral flow was not found with heparin treatment. In view of the correlation of extra-coronary collateral flow with latissimus muscle flow, the lack of a heparin effect may have been due to low latissimus blood flow.

In Japanese, “Moyamoya ” means “hazy puff of smoke ” and refers to the angiographic appearance of the abnormal network of vessels that develop {{at the base of}} the brain and basal ganglia to supply a <b>collateral</b> route of <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> We report here the case of Moyamoya disease in a 5 year-old girl with normal mentality with a one year history of epilepsy, with Todd’s paralysis. This condition is rare and most patients are diagnosed in childhood. With this report we aim to underscore the possibility that a usual neurological sign could be associated with unusual neurological disorders...|$|R
40|$|Radionuclide {{studies were}} {{performed}} to determine pulmonary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in six children who had undergone surgery for pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect, and hypoplastic pulmonary arteries with or without major aortopulmonary <b>collateral</b> arteries. Lung <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was assessed from both particle perfusion lung scans and the pulmonary and systemic phase of a radionuclide dynamic flow study. Five patients had perfusion defects identified on the particle perfusion lung scan. In three of these, abnormal areas were perfused only during the systemic phase of the flow study, a combination of findings that indicate the presence of perfusion by collateral arteries. In one patient no systemic perfusion was noted and in one an initial particle perfusion study indicated {{the presence of a}} lung segment perfused by a collateral artery. In this last patient the particle perfusion scan after total correction showed a reduction {{in the size of the}} lung perfusion defect and no evidence of lung perfusion during the systemic phase of the flow study. The particle perfusion lung scan in the sixth patient showed pronounced asymmetry in <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> to the lungs with no segmental perfusion defect on the particle perfusion scan and no abnormalities on the systemic flow study. It is concluded that radionuclide lung perfusion and flow studies provide useful information on lung perfusion and merit further evaluation to define their role in the management of these patients...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to compression, the vein develops intraluminal fibrous spurs {{from the effects}} of the chronic pulsatile compressive force from the artery. The narrowed turbulent channel predisposes the patient to thrombosis. The compromised <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> often causes <b>collateral</b> <b>blood</b> vessels to form. These are most often horizontal transpelvis collaterals, connecting both internal iliac veins, thus creating outflow through the right common iliac vein. Sometimes vertical collaterals are formed, most often paralumbar, which can cause neurological symptoms, like tingling and numbness.|$|R
