50|$|R-C coupled {{coupling}} is {{the most}} widely used method of coupling in multistage amplifiers. In this case the Resistance R is the resistor connected at the <b>collector</b> <b>terminal</b> and the capacitor C is connected in between the amplifiers. It is also called a blocking capacitor, since it will block DC voltage. The main disadvantage of this coupling method is that it causes some loss for the low frequency signals. However, for amplifying signals of frequencies greater than 10 Hz, this coupling is the best and least expensive method. It is usually applied in small signal amplifiers, such as in record players, tape recorders, radio receivers, etc.|$|E

An emitter terminal forms an emitter contact on the donor layer, and a <b>collector</b> <b>terminal</b> forms a collector contact on the donor layer. A base terminal is electrically conductively connected with the high-mobility layer. The transistor can be produced in a HEMT technology or BiFET technology in GaAs...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{vertical}} architecture hybrid transistor devices using p-type silicon as <b>collector</b> <b>terminal</b> and 2, 6 -diphenylindenofluorene as organic semiconductor in the emitter layer. Polystyrene spheres {{were used as}} shadow masks {{in order to control}} the diameter and density of the openings in the Al metallic base. Two processes of sphere deposition were used: electrospray and dip-coating. The electrospray deposition leads to a smaller density of sphere agglomerates, but for the used sphere diameter, ∼ 200 nm, the transistor performance is similar for devices prepared with sphere deposition by both techniques. The so constructed permeable-base transistors show common-emitter current gain of the order of 102...|$|E
25|$|Nanofuidic triode is a {{three-terminal}} {{double junction}} nanofluidic device composed of positive-charged alumina and negative-charged silica nanochannels. The device {{is essentially a}} three-terminal bipolar junction transistor. By controlling the voltage across emitter and <b>collector</b> <b>terminals,</b> one can regulate the ion current from base terminal {{to one of the}} other two terminals, functioning as an ionic single-pole, double-throw switch.|$|R
50|$|The image {{represents}} a typical bipolar transistor in a circuit. Charge will flow between emitter and <b>collector</b> <b>terminals</b> {{depending on the}} current in the base. Because internally the base and emitter connections behave like a semiconductor diode, a voltage drop develops between base and emitter while the base current exists. The amount of this voltage depends on the material the transistor is made from, and {{is referred to as}} VBE.|$|R
5000|$|As most {{amplifiers}} are inverting ( [...] {{as defined}} above is positive), the effective capacitance at their inputs is increased due to the Miller effect. This can reduce the bandwidth of the amplifier, restricting its range of operation to lower frequencies. The tiny junction and stray capacitances between the base and <b>collector</b> <b>terminals</b> of a Darlington transistor, for example, may be drastically increased by the Miller effects due to its high gain, lowering the high frequency response of the device.|$|R
40|$|A signal {{transformation}} network {{which is}} uniquely characterized to exhibit {{a very low}} input impedance while maintaining a linear transfer characteristic when driven from a voltage source and when quiescently biased in the low microampere current range is described. In its simplest form, it consists of a tightly coupled two transistor network in which a common emitter input stage is interconnected directly with an emitter follower stage to provide virtually 100 percent negative feedback to the base input of the common emitter stage. Bias to the network is supplied via the common tie point of the common emitter stage <b>collector</b> <b>terminal</b> and the emitter follower base stage terminal by a regulated constant current source, and {{the output of the}} circuit is taken from the collector of the emitter follower stage...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{high voltage}} power transistor is a vertical device. That is, {{one in which}} the current flow is vertical. This construction technique has evolved from both physical reasons and the relative ease of construction of these devices. Whether the device is a Field Effect Transister (FET) or a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), this vertical current flow results in the substrate, that part of the silicon wafer on which the device is built, being the drain or the <b>collector</b> <b>terminal.</b> If it is wished to integrate circuitry to control the power device on the same chip, the fact that the substrate is a terminal which can change its potential as the load or device characteristics are varied, presents severe common mode problems. A lateral transistor, one in which all terminals are {{on the top of the}} chip and the resultant current flow is lateral to the top, can alleviate these problems to some extent. While this construction technique is not common, numerous examples of these devices exist in the literature. Generally these devices are either low voltage units or, for a given value of voltage/current capability, they use considerably more chip surface than a comparable vertical device. In this study, a new lateral device, The LAteral Bipolar Field Effect Transistor or LABFET, is described. This device replaces the normal n+-drain diffusion, used in the typical Double Diffused MOS (DMOS) transistor with a p-type diffusion. This p-diffusion acts as the emitter of a low gain p- n-p bipolar transistor. The base of this device is the n-substrate or n-well, when the device is part of an integrated circuit. The base current is supplied by turning on the DMOS Field Effect Transistor. The result is a conductivity modulated device, with all terminals on the top of the chip, a voltage withstand capability of 100 V and an on-staAte conductance of. 71 Siemans per cm of gate width. This is comparable with conventional vertical FET devices. The static and dynamic characteristics of 2 ̆ 2 Unit cell 2 ̆ 2 devices are presented with an explanation of the results and a description of the processing to produce them. Finally, suggestions are made which would allow the extension of this concept to a large device suitable for integration into a power integrated circuit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{a new and}} simple approach to accurately characterize the transient self-heating effect in Si-Ge Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (HBTs), based on pulse measurements and verified through transient electro-thermal simulations. The measurements {{have been carried out}} over pulses applied at Base and <b>Collector</b> <b>terminals</b> simultaneously and the time response of Collector current increase due to self-heating effect are obtained. Compared to previous approach, a complete calibration has been performed including all the passive elements such as coaxial cables, connectors and bias network. Furthermore, time domain junction temperature variations, current of heat flux and lattice temperature distribution have been obtained numerically by means of 3 D electro-thermal device simulations. The thermal parameters extracted from measurements using HiCuM HBT compact model have been verified with the parameters extracted from electro-thermal transient simulation. It has been shown that, the standard R-C thermal network is not sufficient to accurately model the thermal spreading behavior and therefore a recursive network has been employed which is more physical and suitable for transient electro-thermal modeling. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|A {{resonant}} reset forward converter {{was developed}} {{as one of}} the topologies of the forward converter because it offered the simplest technique of transformer core resetting. The resonant reset topology does not require any external passive components or any tertiary winding to facilitate the core reset but it utilizes the magnetizing inductance of the transformer and the parasitic capacitances of the devices to bring down the core flux to its initial position and hence avoids core saturation of the transformer, which is the principle working device in the converter {{from the point of view}} of electrical isolation and reproduction of good quality dc voltage at the output (or the load). The saturation of the transformer would have otherwise led to heavy inrush current resulting in huge losses and degradation in efficiency of the converter. Thus in a low power dc-dc converter this resonant reset topology of the forward converter offers significant advantages. The small signal model of the converter which was proposed using the switch averaging method was validated using the software PSPICE and it gave perfect ripple free dc waveform at the output. The closed loop stage involved the development of a type IIIB controller to generate a sufficient phase margin and hence improve stability. The Optocoupler was also used in the feedback for the purpose of maintaining the electrical isolation and the pole which it generated (due to Miller’s capacitance) was compensated by manually placing a combination of a parallel resistor and capacitor at the output of the <b>collector</b> <b>terminals</b> of the transistor of the Optocoupler. Finally the hardware developments were done for the voltage mode controlled feedback loop using IC UC 3525 A which gave satisfactory results for various load tests and desired input voltage fluctuations...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of transistors, which have slight {{differences}} in how they are used in a circuit. A bipolar transistor has <b>terminals</b> labeled base, <b>collector,</b> and emitter. A small current at the base terminal (that is, flowing between the base and the emitter) can control or switch a much larger current between the <b>collector</b> and emitter <b>terminals.</b> For a field-effect transistor, the terminals are labeled gate, source, and drain, and a voltage at the gate can control a current between source and drain.|$|R
40|$|The notions on {{the sources}} and {{structure}} of the colored dissolved organic matter concentration field in the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait waters are first obtained {{on the basis of the}} results of several expeditions carried out by the scientists of Marine Hydrophysical Institute. It is shown that in the Sea of Azov the main natural source of this substance is related to the river runoff, particularly significant for the northern and eastern coasts; in the Kerch Strait – with the Black Sea subsurface waters. It was found that transformed river waters with high dissolved organic matter content do not penetrate into the southern sea area and the Kerch Strait, whereby in the predominant part of the Azov Sea waters the colored dissolved organic matter typical concentration defined by the optical methods turns out to be by an order lower than the available calculated estimates. Our measurement data for the Black Sea waters were in line with the earlier defined dissolved organic matter content by chemical methods. In the colored dissolved organic matter field of the Kerch Strait the frontal zone coinciding with the main thermohaline front, that delimits the interacting Black Sea and Azov Sea waters, is revealed. The lens with high colored dissolved organic matter concentration related to anthropogenic influence of harbors and industrial plants situated at the shore, the sewage <b>collectors,</b> cargo <b>terminals,</b> off-shore transshipment sites and ground landfills are revealed...|$|R
40|$|Electron cooling of ion beams with {{energies}} of some GeV per nucleon requires high-quality electron beams of MeV energies and currents {{as high as}} several amperes. The enormous beam power dictates that the beam current {{be returned to the}} high voltage terminal which provides the accelerating potential. The beam is returned to a carefully designed <b>collector</b> within the <b>terminal</b> and biased a few kV positive with respect to it. Thus the load on the HV supply is only the accelerating potential times the sum of the beam current loss and the current used to maintain a graded potential on the accelerating structure. If one employs an electrostatic HV supply like a Van de Graaff with maximum charging current of a few hundred {micro}A, the permissible fractional loss is {approximately} 10 {sup {minus} 4 }. During the 15 years or so the concept of medium energy electron cooling has been evolving, the need to demonstrate the practicability of such high efficiency beam recovery has been recognized. This paper will review some experimental tests and further experiments which have been proposed.
