30|$|Using {{production}} {{logging tools}} has some possibilities like a homogeneous reservoir, single-phase flow, and the stable system should {{appear on the}} reservoir system. One of the chief aims of production logging tools is to eliminate the small-scale non-homogeneity principals of <b>cable</b> <b>logs.</b> Moreover, it calibrates their homogeneity extremity. This technique could enroll as depth interval detection in those layers which have more permeability regarding immediate alterations in the well flow logs. Therefore, these inefficiencies may not be illustrated by core plugs and <b>cable</b> <b>logs.</b> The most extraordinary appeal of production logging tools is to obtain the appropriate vertical dispersion of the reservoir layers, which helps to the accurate explanation of flow units in the reservoir. In the areas with a low volume of flow rate or low productivity index, {{it would not be}} preferred to utilize production logging tools instead of core analysis. Production logging tools have been more reliable and better results when the flow rate does not low enough regarding rotation of the tools.|$|R

50|$|A {{spar tree}} is the tree {{used as the}} highest anchor point in a high lead <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> setup. The spar tree was {{selected}} based on height, location and especially strength and lack of rot in order to withstand the weight and pressure required.

50|$|High lead logging is {{a method}} of <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> using a spar, yarder and loader. It was {{developed}} by Oscar Wirkkala. It is accomplished with two lines (cables) and two winches (or cable drums). The mainline or yarding line extends out from one winch, while a second usually lighter line called the haulback line extends out from the other winch to a 'tail block' or pulley at the tail (back) end of the logging site, and passes through the tail block and connects to the main line. Butt rigging is installed where the two lines join and the logs are hooked to the butt rigging with chokers. The procedure is to wind up the main line and the logs are pulled in, wind up the haulback and the butt rigging is pulled out for more logs or another 'turn'.|$|E
5000|$|Shovel logging, {{sometimes}} called Hoe Chucking, uses a log loader to swing logs {{to the forest}} road. Shovel logging {{is one of a}} number of methods that may be used to move logs from forest to road. Rather than driving out to the log and dragging it back to the landing, the loader moves slowly across the harvest area, grabbing logs/trees within reach, and swinging them around to drop them closer to the road. Logs further from the road can be shoveled to the landing in a few passes back and forth. [...] Skidding and <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> can be more cost efficient for logs further from the road. Shovel logging can make use of the loader between log truck arrivals. It can also reduce soil disturbance, since it requires only a single pass to move all the logs in reach.|$|E

30|$|Downhole {{geophysical}} {{borehole logging}} is an in situ nondestructive process of measuring the physical, chemical, and structural properties of penetrated geological formations and surrounding borehole annulus. The technique involves lowering of sonde (probe) into a borehole using suspended armored cable or wire device called wireline or <b>logging</b> <b>cable.</b> The <b>logging</b> <b>cable</b> {{is connected to}} the winch and transmits recorded signals to the digital computers for data visualization, monitoring, and recording. The measured subsurface properties are dependent on the type of the lowered probe. Geophysical logs have been widely used, especially in petroleum industry, as tools in unraveling information on aquifer and fluid characteristics, paleo-hydrogeology, and correlation and distribution of subsurface sedimentary strata. Because geophysical logging is a repeatable and comparable process, {{it can be used to}} provide continuous in situ information on the subsurface rock type, bed thickness, permeability, porosity, bulk density, resistivity, and the nature of saturating fluids (Hallenburg 1987; Repsold 1989; Mares et al. 1994; Keys 1997; Buckley 2000; Hearst et al. 2000; Buckley et al. 2001). In addition, geophysical logs can confirm the completion details, identify the individual water inflows, characterize salinity and freshness, determine freshwater–saline water interface, and identify problems in cased boreholes (Buckley et al. 2001). It can therefore act as a guide in borehole designs and rehabilitating process of damaged boreholes.|$|R
50|$|A choker setter or choke setter is a logger who {{attaches}} <b>cables</b> to <b>logs</b> for retrieval by skidders or skylines. The {{work process}} involves the choker setter wrapping a special cable end (choker) around a log and then moving clear so the yarding engineer (e.g. skidder operator) can pull the log {{to a central}} area. In clearcutting, fallers will typically cut down all the trees and limb and buck them into logs before the choke setters and others arrive to remove the logs.|$|R
5000|$|Felled logs {{are then}} {{generally}} transported to a sawmill {{to be cut}} into lumber, to a paper mill for paper pulp, or for other uses, for example, as fence posts. Many methods {{have been used to}} move logs from where they were cut to a rail line or directly to a sawmill or paper mill. The cheapest and historically most common method is making use of a river's current to float floating tree trunks downstream, by either log driving or timber rafting. (Some logs sink because of high resin content; these are called deadheads.) To help herd the logs to the mill, in 1960 the Alaskan Lumber and Pulp Mill had a specially designed boat that was constructed of [...] inch (1.5 in) steel. In the late 1800s and {{the first half of the}} 1900s, the most common method was the high-wheel loader, which was a set of wheels over ten feet tall that the log or logs were strapped beneath. Oxen were at first used with the high-wheel loaders, but in the 1930s tractors replaced the oxen. In 1960 the largest high wheel loader was built for service in California. Called the Bunyan Buggie, the unit was self-propelled and had wheels 24 ft high and a front dozer blade that was 30 ft across and 6 ft high. Log transportation can be challenging and costly since trees are often far from roads or watercourses. Road building and maintenance may be restricted in National Forests or other wilderness areas since it can cause erosion in riparian zones. When felled logs sit adjacent to a road, heavy machinery may simply lift logs onto trucks. Most often, special heavy equipment is used to gather the logs from the site and move them close to the road to be lifted on trucks. Many methods exist to transport felled logs lying away from roads. <b>Cable</b> <b>logging</b> involves a yarder, which pulls one or several logs along the ground to a platform where a truck is waiting. When the terrain is too uneven to pull logs on the ground, a skyline can lift logs off the ground vertically, similar to a ski lift. Heli-logging, which uses heavy-lift helicopters to remove cut trees from forests by lifting them on cables attached to a helicopter, may be used when <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> is not allowed for environmental reasons or when roads are lacking. It reduces the level of infrastructure required to log in a specific location, reducing the environmental impact of logging. Less mainstream or now for the most part superseded forms of log transport include horses, oxen, or balloon logging.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The forest {{products}} industry often uses intermediate-support <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> systems to transport logs from the harvest site to a staging area. A method {{is presented to}} assist in the analysis and design of these cable systems. The method determines tensions in individual cables, forces on and stresses in the support trees, and the geometry of the system under load. Static equilibrium and cable length compatibility are used to generate a system of simultaneous equations. This system of coupled, non-linear algebraic equations is solved numerically using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. A good, automated initial guess for the unknown quantities, based on the physics of the problem, is provided. A model of an example intermediate support <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> system is analyzed by the proposed approach and the resulting behavior discussed. The method includes the effects of catenary sag and elastic stretch in the cables, and elastic behavior in the support trees. Friction is ignored in the formulation. The catenary and elastic stretch methodologies for the cables are each demonstrated on a single cable span as well as on a demonstration cable system. The effect of the support tree flexibility and cable mass are found to be significant on the response of the <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> system. The effects of elastic stretch in the cables is not found to be significant for the <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> systems considered...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 An {{infiltration}} capacity and surface erodibility {{study was conducted}} six years after forest harvesting in the Oregon Cascades. A portable rainfall simulator was utilized to obtain field measurements on the Coyote Creek and Hi- 15 Watersheds during summer and fall, 1977. Seasonal variations were found to occur in infiltration capacities and surface erodibility. Infiltration capacities increased by 1. 4 times from summer to fall, while surface erodibility characteristics, suspended sediment concentration and sediment yield, decreased from summer to fall. Surface limiting conditions {{during the summer and}} soil profile controlled conditions in the fall were hypothesized to explain this seasonal variation. Nearly all timber harvesting treatments for each study area had statistically equal summer infiltration capacities in comparison with adjacent unlogged areas. In addition, summer surface erodibility characteristics on treated areas were typically less than those found on undisturbed areas. Only certain skid trails, <b>cable</b> <b>log</b> paths and severely disturbed sites such as tractor windrowed and burned areas had substantially reduced infiltration capacities and increased surface erodibility. However, all areas, including the most severely disturbed, had fall infiltration capacities that exceeded usual and maximum fall precipitation intensities. Many skid trails and other highly disturbed and compacted areas at Coyote Creek appeared to have greatly recovered since logging six years ago. Freezing/thawing, biological activity, and shrinking and swelling of soils may account for this recovery in infiltration capacities, surface erodibility and soil properties. Skid trails and severely disturbed areas may partially account for peak flow increases and minor sedimentation the first few years after logging. However, data from this study collected six years following timber harvesting do not support the premise that continued increases in peak flows are caused by changes in infiltration capacities, except perhaps for a tractor windrowed and burned area. Predictive models for {{infiltration capacity}} (normally distributed) and surface erodibility characteristics (requiring normalizing transformations) were not found using regression techniques because of large amounts of variance.

40|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>logging</b> {{will become}} more {{important}} as harvesting shifts to greater annual proportions on steep terrain in New Zealand. The costs of <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> are considerably {{higher than that of}} conventional ground-based methods. Improving cost-effectiveness has been identified as key to ensuring the forestry industry remains cost competitive in the international market. This thesis focuses on ways to better understand and improve <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> methods by specifically focusing on rigging configurations. The investigation was conducted through a comprehensive literature review, an industry survey to establish current use and preferences, a Delphi survey with experts to establish actual advantages and disadvantages, scale model testing to establish some fundamental knowledge of tension to deflection relationship, and finally a series of targeted case studies to establish both productivity and skyline tension in actual operations. Each of these aspects of the research topic employed different methodology. The literature review highlighted the most relevant research relating to <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> world-wide spanning nearly a century. Various research papers, manuals, books and computer software were summarized. While many aspects of cable yarding operations have been investigated, much of it focusing on various aspects of operational efficiency through case studies, there is very limited information with regard to rigging configurations. The survey of 50 <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> practitioners determined what rigging configurations were commonly used in New Zealand. It includes their perceived advantages and disadvantages for varying levels of deflection, but also for specific scenarios such as pulling away from native forest boundaries and flying logs over a stream. Results showed that there were many conflicting perceptions about rigging configuration options. Using an expert panel, a Delphi process was used to derive consensus on what advantages were truly unique to each configuration. This allowed the longer lists of perceived advantages from the industry survey to be pared down to a concise list of ad/disadvantages that will be used in the updating of the Best Practice Guidelines for <b>Cable</b> <b>Logging.</b> To increase our fundamental understanding of tension / payload / deflection relationships, an experiment was conducted in a controlled environment. Using a model yarder in a lab and continuous tension and video recording devices, the dynamic skyline behavior of three similar configurations were tested: North Bend, South Bend and Block in the Bight. The tensions were compared by use of a two-way analysis of variance, which indicated configuration and choker length were significant variables in some but not all of the dynamic load tests. Results also showed that some configurations performed better than others in minimizing the shock loads due to dropping into full suspension, impact with ground objects, and breakout during bridling. Finally, a series of eight studies were conducted on targeted logging operations where relevant stand and terrain parameters were related to the continuous skyline tension monitoring, and recording of productivity through time study. The three targeted configurations included (1) North Bend, (2) Standing skyline using a motorized slack-pulling carriage and (3) a live skyline using a motorized grapple carriage. Results showed that peak and average tensions, as well as amplification factors and the payload to tension relationship, varied between configurations. The study also showed that tensions could be collected to compute measures of payload and tension efficiency, which provided insight into operational performance. The safe working load was exceeded in 53 % of all cycles studied and across seven of eight study sites and 14 of 16 spans. Cycle times were significantly different between rigging configurations and that production information could be used to compute measures of labor and energy consumption as well as payload and tension efficiency; which also provide insight into operational performance. The industry should give serious consideration to the use of tension monitors. Tension monitors have many benefits and have the potential to improve <b>cable</b> <b>logging</b> operations in New Zealand. Monitoring tensions can help one learn new techniques or methods (i. e. rigging configurations), help improve payload analysis software for future planning and help evaluate new technology and machinery...|$|E
