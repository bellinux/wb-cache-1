50|$|Reverse {{engineering}} of {{a mechanical}} component requires a precise digital {{model of the}} objects to be reproduced. Rather than a set of points a precise digital model can be represented by a polygon mesh, a set of flat or curved NURBS surfaces, or ideally for mechanical components, a CAD solid model. A 3D scanner {{can be used to}} digitise free-form or gradually changing shaped components as well as prismatic geometries whereas a <b>coordinate</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>machine</b> is usually used only to determine simple dimensions of a highly prismatic model.

50|$|A CMM (<b>coordinate</b> <b>measuring</b> <b>machine)</b> is {{an example}} of a contact 3D scanner. It is used mostly in {{manufacturing}} and can be very precise. The disadvantage of CMMs though, is that it requires contact with the object being scanned. Thus, the act of scanning the object might modify or damage it. This fact is very significant when scanning delicate or valuable objects such as historical artifacts. The other disadvantage of CMMs is that they are relatively slow compared to the other scanning methods. Physically moving the arm that the probe is mounted on can be very slow and the fastest CMMs can only operate on a few hundred hertz. In contrast, an optical system like a laser scanner can operate from 10 to 500 kHz.|$|E
