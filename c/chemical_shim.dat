5000|$|Pressurized water {{reactors}} (PWR) use a <b>chemical</b> <b>shim</b> in the moderator/coolant (see {{nuclear reactor}} technology) to control power level, and so normally do not load follow. (In most PWRs, control rods are either fully withdrawn or fully inserted - variable control is difficult, {{partly due to}} the large bundle sizes.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In France, however, {{nuclear power}} plants use load following. French PWRs use [...] "grey" [...] control rods made of boron steel, in order to replace <b>chemical</b> <b>shim,</b> without {{introducing}} a large perturbation of the power distribution. These plants {{have the capability to}} make power changes between 30% and 100% of rated power, with a slope of 5% of rated power per minute. Their licensing permits them to respond very quickly to the grid requirements.|$|E
50|$|Other {{means of}} {{controlling}} reactivity include (for PWR) a soluble neutron absorber (boric acid) {{added to the}} reactor coolant, allowing the complete extraction of the control rods during stationary power operation, ensuring an even power and flux distribution over the entire core. This <b>chemical</b> <b>shim,</b> along {{with the use of}} burnable neutron poisons within the fuel pellets, is used to assist regulation of the core's long term reactivity, while the control rods are used for rapid reactor power changes (e.g. shutdown and start up). Operators of BWRs use the coolant flow through the core to control reactivity by varying the speed of the reactor recirculation pumps (an increase in coolant flow through the core improves the removal of steam bubbles, thus increasing the density of the coolant/moderator, increasing power).|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional TrueFISP: The TrueFISP {{sequence}} {{as proposed}} by Oppelt et al. in 1986 offers a high contrast between myocardium and intraventricular cavity, which is desirable for accurate assessment of ventricular function. A significant drawback of True- FISP is its sensitivity to off-resonance effects caused by an imperfect <b>shim,</b> <b>chemical</b> shifts, eddy currents, and Maxwell effects. An extension of the two-dimensional TrueFISP sequence to an ECG gated three-dimensional TrueFISP sequence is thus not straight forward and requires a very carefully designed acquisition scheme. The current implementation of our gated three-dimensional TrueFISP sequence allows to acquire the complete heart in its diastolic phase within about 20 heartbeats with a resolution of 2 x 2 x 3 mm. In addition, a three-dimensional TrueFISP cine technique with a time resolution of 80 ms and a spatial resolution of 3 x 4 x 4 mm was implemented. hTcersion recoveo" TrueFISP: Two-dimensional inversion recovery TrueFISP is a new method for T 1 quantification of the myocard within several heartbeats. The intrinsically T~ weighted FLASH readout module {{was replaced by a}} TrueFISP readout module to continuously acquire the recovery of longitudinal magnetization alter inversion or saturation. Quantitative T~ measurements on phantoms and on humans based on FLASH and TrueFISP were compared to the gold standard of separately acquired TI measurements. Applications of IR TrueFISP may include quantitative assessment of myocard damage after CA administration...|$|R
50|$|Soluble poisons, {{also called}} <b>chemical</b> <b>shim,</b> produce a {{spatially}} uniform neutron absorption when dissolved {{in the water}} coolant. The most common soluble poison in commercial pressurized water reactors (PWR) is boric acid, which {{is often referred to}} as soluble boron. The boric acid in the coolant decreases the thermal utilization factor, causing a decrease in reactivity. By varying the concentration of boric acid in the coolant, a process referred to as boration and dilution, the reactivity of the core can be easily varied. If the boron concentration is increased, the coolant/moderator absorbs more neutrons, adding negative reactivity. If the boron concentration is reduced (dilution), positive reactivity is added. The changing of boron concentration in a PWR is a slow process and is used primarily to compensate for fuel burnout or poison buildup. The variation in boron concentration allows control rod use to be minimized, which results in a flatter flux profile over the core than can be produced by rod insertion. The flatter flux profile occurs because there are no regions of depressed flux like those that would be produced in the vicinity of inserted control rods. This system is not in widespread use because the chemicals make the moderator temperature reactivity coefficient less negative. All commercial PWR types operating in the US (Westinghouse, Combustion Engineering, and Babcock & Wilcox) employ soluble boron to control excess reactivity. US Navy reactors and Boiling Water Reactors do not.|$|E
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study of}} changes in coolant {{activity}} due to corrosion products of extended burn-up cycles of 18 - 24 months duration, in a typical pressurized water reactor, under pH and boric acid variations. It deals with non-linearly changing corrosion rates coupled with pH effects. The CPAIR-P computer program was modified to accommodate for time-dependent rising corrosion and effects of coolant chemistry. These simulations suggest {{that the effect of}} an increase in pH value for an extended 24 -month cycle on a specific activity, {{in the form of a}} decrease in the said activity, is smeared by the rising corrosion. The new saturation values for activity at the end-of-cycle are lower than with a reactor operated at constant low pH/natural boric acid in the coolant. For a non-linear rise in the corrosion rate coupled with a pH rise from 6. 9 to 7. 4 and the use of enriched boric acid (30 %- 40 %), coolant activity first rises to a peak value during the cycle and then approaches a much smaller saturation value at the end of the cycle, when compared with the activity for the system having a constant low pH value (6. 9) in the coolant. In this work, we have shown that the use of enriched boric acid as a <b>chemical</b> <b>shim</b> actually lowers primary coolant activity when higher pH values, rather than natural boric acid, are employed in the coolant. For multiple long-term operating cycles, the saturation value of corrosion product activity increases in the first two cycles and becomes constant in subsequent ones, due to the high operational pH value for enriched boric acid (40 %) as a <b>chemical</b> <b>shim...</b>|$|E
