5|$|The main {{sources for}} {{knowledge}} of Wilfrid are the medieval Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, written by Stephen of Ripon soon after Wilfrid's death, and {{the works of}} the medieval historian Bede, who knew Wilfrid during the bishop's lifetime. Stephen's Vita is a hagiography, intended to show Wilfrid as a saintly man, and to buttress claims that he was a saint. The Vita is selective in its coverage, and gives short shrift to Wilfrid's activities outside of Northumbria. Two-thirds of the work deals with Wilfrid's attempts to return to Northumbria, and is a defence and vindication of his Northumbrian career. Stephen's work is flattering and highly favourable to Wilfrid, making its use as a source problematic; despite its shortcomings however, the Vita is the main source of information on Wilfrid's life. It views the events in Northumbria in the light of Wilfrid's reputation and from his point of view, and is highly partisan. Another concern is that hagiographies were usually full of <b>conventional</b> <b>material,</b> often repeated from earlier saints' lives, {{as was the case with}} Stephen's work. It appears that the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi was not well known in the Middle Ages, as only two manuscripts of the work survive.|$|E
25|$|In {{a slab of}} <b>conventional</b> <b>material</b> with an {{ordinary}} refractive index – a right-handed material (RHM) – the wave front is transmitted away from the source. In a NIM the wavefront travels toward the source. However, the magnitude {{and direction of the}} flow of energy essentially remains the same in both the ordinary material and the NIM. Since the flow of energy remains the same in both materials (media), the impedance of the NIM matches the RHM. Hence, the sign of the intrinsic impedance is still positive in a NIM.|$|E

The study is conducted on <b>conventional</b> tooling <b>materials</b> such as aluminum, brass and mild steel {{that were used}} as substrates. The tribological properties of uncoated pins of aluminum, brass and mild steel with same diameters and after applying chromium based coatings were measured by pin on disc tribometer. <b>Conventional</b> <b>materials</b> are subjected to high cyclic loading, friction, wear and fatigue resulting in high levels of abrasion.

50|$|The {{building}} is extremely light weight and features very few <b>conventional</b> <b>materials.</b> The main roof structure {{is almost entirely}} composed of the recycled wings. The use of the wings makes for a structure that uses materials more efficiently to achieve higher strength with less weight. Using the wings to achieve the curvilinear roof structure desired by the client saved {{a substantial amount of}} embodied energy, carbon dioxide output, and construction waste, compared to building a similar sized house made from <b>conventional</b> <b>materials</b> {{that would have to be}} transported up and down the mountain to the same location. Using the wing was also a substantial cost reduction. Even at $8-18,000 per hour for the helicopter and $30,000 for the 747, it was still a fraction of the cost of building a similarly shaped roof with <b>conventional</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|R
50|$|Optical {{properties}} can {{be expanded}} beyond {{the capabilities of}} lenses, mirrors, and other <b>conventional</b> <b>materials.</b> One of the effects most studied is the negative index of refraction first proposed by Victor Veselago in 1967. Negative index materials, exhibit optical properties opposite to those of glass, air, and the other <b>conventional</b> <b>materials.</b> At the correct frequencies, the negative index metamaterial refracts electromagnetic waves in novel ways, to a zero index or negative index. Also, energy can propagate {{in the opposite direction}} which can result in compensation mechanisms, among other possibilities.|$|R

50|$|In 2016, Ahmad Rafsanjani {{described}} {{the use of}} Islamic geometric patterns from tomb towers in Iran to create auxetic materials from perforated rubber sheets. These are stable in either a contracted or an expanded state, and can switch between the two, which might be useful for surgical stents or for spacecraft components. When a <b>conventional</b> <b>material</b> is stretched along one axis, it contracts along other axes ({{at right angles to}} the stretch). But auxetic materials expand at right angles to the pull. The internal structure that enables this unusual behaviour is inspired by two of the 70 Islamic patterns that Rafsanjani noted on the tomb towers.|$|E

50|$|In {{the wake}} of the group's {{international}} tour, Café Tacvba withdrew from music for a while. When they returned to work, they gathered in their own studio and spent roughly a half-year working on experimental music that encompassed ambient electronica and musique concrète, as well as collaborative work with the Kronos Quartet, an American string quartet. Santaolalla liked the resulting music and deemed it ready for release. WEA, however, did not like the idea releasing an entirely instrumental album of experimental music, after the group had gained success with their more accessible style of music. In the end, WEA and Café Tacvba reached a compromise: if the band would record a second album of more <b>conventional</b> <b>material,</b> the label would release both as a double-disc package and sell it for the cost of a standard single-disc album.|$|E
50|$|Spider-Man's bodily {{tissue is}} a great deal more durable and {{resistant}} to some types of injury than a normal human (for example, a regular human punched Spider-Man and broke his wrist). However, Spider-Man is far from invulnerable. While his body is tougher than an ordinary human, as seen several times in Spider-Man 2 (via falling from average web slinging height without sustaining significant injury), he can still be injured in ways comparable to an ordinary human. For example, Spider-Man can be injured by bullets or knives composed of <b>conventional</b> <b>material</b> and from impacts of sufficient force. However, if injured, his accelerated metabolism is capable of repairing itself many times faster than an ordinary human. A doctor has told Spider-Man that it would be impossible for a normal man to survive the punishment that he has endured.|$|E
50|$|Spin {{engineering}} {{describes the}} control and manipulation of quantum spin systems to develop devices and materials. This includes {{the use of the}} spin degrees of freedom as a probe for spin based phenomena. Because of the basic importance of quantum spin for physical and chemical processes, spin engineering is relevant {{for a wide range of}} scientific and technological applications. Current examples range from Bose-Einstein condensation to spin-based data storage and reading in state-of-the-art hard disk drives, as well as from powerful analytical tools like nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to the development of magnetic molecules as qubits and magnetic nanoparticles. In addition, spin engineering exploits the functionality of spin to design materials with novel properties as well as to provide a better understanding and advanced applications of <b>conventional</b> <b>material</b> systems. Many chemical reactions are devised to create bulk materials or single molecules with well defined spin properties, such as a single-molecule magnet.The aim of this article is to provide an outline of fields of research and development where the focus is on the properties and applications of quantum spin.|$|E
