50|$|The Haus des Rundfunks ("House of Broadcasting"), {{located in}} the Westend {{district}} of Berlin, Germany, is the oldest self-contained broadcasting house in the world.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used anticancer drugs are platinum-based. Their {{efficacy}} might be improved by carriers which can transport large numbers of Pt <b>centres,</b> <b>shield</b> the drug from premature activation, and/or deliver Pt specifically to cancer cells using vectors which recognise specific targets. We describe recent progress using functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nanorods, hollow Prussian blue (HPB), magnetic iron oxide and gold nanoparticles, liposomes, nanogels and polymers, as well as active targeting by conjugation to biodegradable proteins and peptides (e. g. EGF, heparin, herceptin, somatostatin and TAT). Spatially targeted activation of PtIV prodrugs using light is also a promising approach. Interestingly, use of these new delivery and targeting systems for platinum drugs can lead to species with unusual reactivity which can kill cancer cells by new mechanisms...|$|R

5000|$|On {{so small}} a coin it is {{impossible}} that the device can be at once conspicuous and striking unless it is simple—complexity would defeat the object.
