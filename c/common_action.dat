We establish an energy function that evaluates geometric and photometric consistency, and solve the action recognition problem by optimizing the energy function. The proposed stochastic inference algorithm based on the Monte Carlo method explores the video pair from the local spatio-temporal interest point matches to find the <b>common</b> <b>actions.</b> Our algorithm works in unsupervised way without prior knowledge about the type {{and the number of}} <b>common</b> <b>actions.</b> Experiments show that our algorithm produces promising results on single and multiple action recognition.

25|$|The {{result was}} that Philip was {{suspected}} of a tendency toward Zwinglianism. His sympathy for the Reformers associated with Zwingli in Switzerland and Bucer in Strasburg was intensified by the anger of the emperor at receiving from Philip a statement of Protestant tenets composed by the ex-Franciscan Lambert, and the landgrave's failure to secure any <b>common</b> <b>action</b> {{on the part of}} the Protestant powers regarding the approaching Turkish war. Philip eagerly embraced Zwingli's plan of a great Protestant alliance to extend from the Adriatic to Denmark to keep the Holy Roman Emperor from crossing into Germany. This association caused some coldness between himself and the followers of Luther at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, especially when he propounded his irenic policy to Melanchthon and urged that all Protestants should stand together in demanding that a general council alone should decide religious differences. This was supposed to be indicative of Zwinglianism, and Philip soon found it necessary to explain his exact position on the question of the Eucharist, whereupon he declared that he fully agreed with the Lutherans, but disapproved of persecuting the Swiss.|$|E

500|$|According to Oscar Schachter, {{there is}} some {{question}} as to whether the traditional international lawmaking process of state-by-state treaty ratification is adequate today: [...] "The traditional case-by-case process of customary law cannot meet the necessity for <b>common</b> <b>action</b> to deal with the numerous problems raised by technological developments, demographic and environmental impacts, changing attitudes as to social justice, or the many requirements of international business. While all of these matters can be dealt with by multilateral treaties, the treaty processes are often complicated and slow, whereas UN resolutions can be more readily attained." [...] The Law of the Sea is an example of an agreement that has taken decades to pass in the U.S. (although the Cato Institute views the delay as a good thing.) George Monbiot argues, [...] "The absence of an international legislature undermines the authority of an international judiciary (such as the proposed criminal court). Judges presiding over the war-crimes tribunals at the Hague and in Arusha have been forced, in effect, to make up the law as they go along." ...|$|E
500|$|Article 8 of the Covenant {{gave the}} League {{the task of}} {{reducing}} [...] "armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by <b>common</b> <b>action</b> of international obligations." [...] A significant amount of the League's time and energy was devoted to this goal, even though many member governments were uncertain that such extensive disarmament could be achieved or was even desirable. The Allied powers were also under obligation by the Treaty of Versailles to attempt to disarm, and the armament restrictions imposed on the defeated countries had {{been described as the}} first step toward worldwide disarmament. The League Covenant assigned the League the task of creating a disarmament plan for each state, but the Council devolved this responsibility to a special commission set up in 1926 to prepare for the 1932–34 World Disarmament Conference. Members of the League held different views towards the issue. The French were reluctant to reduce their armaments without a guarantee of military help if they were attacked; Poland and Czechoslovakia felt vulnerable to attack from the west and wanted the League's response to aggression against its members to be strengthened before they disarmed. Without this guarantee, they would not reduce armaments because they felt the risk of attack from Germany was too great. Fear of attack increased as Germany regained its strength after the First World War, especially after Adolf Hitler gained power and became German Chancellor in 1933. In particular, Germany's attempts to overturn the Treaty of Versailles and the reconstruction of the German military made France increasingly unwilling to disarm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} theory for {{reasoning}} about actions {{which is based on}} the Product Version of Dynamic Linear Time Temporal Logic (denoted DLT L ⊗) and allows to describe the behaviour of a network of sequential agents which coordinate their activities by performing <b>common</b> <b>actions</b> together. DLT L ⊗ extends LTL, the propositional linear time temporal logic, by strengthening the until operator by indexing it with the regular programs of dynamic logic. Moreover, it allows the formulas of the logic to be decorated with the names of sequential agents, taken from a finite set. The action theory we propose is an extension of the theory presented in [8], which is based on the logic DLTL, and allows reasoning with incomplete initial states and dealing with postdiction, ramifications as well as with nondeterministic actions. Here we extend this theory to cope with multiple agents synchronizing on <b>common</b> <b>actions.</b> ...|$|R
500|$|It remains disputed to {{this day}} how the Anglo-German {{cooperation}} on Venezuela came about, with varying opinions as {{to the source of}} the initiative. In mid-1901, with the distraction of the Boxer Rebellion gone, Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow decided to respond to the German concerns in Venezuela with some form of military intervention, and discussed with the German navy the feasibility of a blockade. Admiral Otto von Diederichs was keen, and recommended occupying Caracas if a blockade didn't succeed. However, disagreements within the German government over whether a blockade should be pacific (permitting neutral ships to pass) or martial (enabling them to be seized) caused delays, and in any case Kaiser Wilhelm II, German Emperor was unconvinced about the military action. Nonetheless, in late 1901 a renewed demand for reparations was backed up by a show of naval strength, with Vineta and Falke sent to the Venezuelan coast. In January 1902 the Kaiser declared a delay to any blockade due to the outbreak of another civil war in Venezuela (led by financier [...] ) which raised the possibility of a more amenable government. [...] Complicating matters were rumours [...] "rampant in the United States and in England" [...] that Germany wanted Margarita Island as a South American naval base; however a May 1900 visit by the German cruiser SMS Vineta had concluded it was unsuitable, and the German navy had become more conscious of how vulnerable such far-flung bases would be. In late 1901, the British Foreign Office became concerned that Britain would look bad if it failed to defend its citizens' interests while Germany took care of theirs, and began sounding out the Germans about a possible <b>common</b> <b>action,</b> initially receiving a negative response. By early 1902, British and German financiers were working together to pressure their respective governments into action. The Italians, who had begun to suspect the existence of plans to enforce debts, sought to be involved too, but Berlin refused. Their participation was agreed to by the British [...] "after Rome had shrewdly pointed out that it could repay the favor in Somalia".|$|E

40|$|Abstract A Communicating Transaction Process (CTP) is a {{computational}} model {{that serves as}} a high level specification language for reactive embedded system components and their interactions. It consists of a network of communicating processes coordinating their behaviors via <b>common</b> <b>actions</b> and the <b>common</b> <b>actions</b> are refined as a set of guarded Message Sequence Charts (MSCs). There has been little work devoted to developing CTP models systematically. This paper takes the first step towards bridging this gap. In our work, communicating processes of embedded components are modeled and controlled as Discrete-Event Systems (DES). The control logic among communicating components is derived by Supervisory Control Theory (SCT), so as to guarantee that the communicating processes meet all predefined constraints and possess other desirable system behavioral properties. The control logic is then translated into propositional formulas for guarded MSCs which then results in a CTP model with guaranteed behavioral properties...|$|R

2500|$|This {{desire for}} <b>common</b> <b>action</b> {{seems to have}} been shared by various unions, as late in 1921 a call was issued {{in the name of the}} country's 16 major railway labor unions seeking a [...] "Conference for Progressive Political Action" [...] (CPPA). The CPPA was {{originally}} intended to be an umbrella organization bringing together various elements of the farmer and labor movement together in a common program.
