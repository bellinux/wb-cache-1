For the experiment, three irons with different modifying potential (0. 0014, 0. 0213 and 0. 033 wt % residual Mg content respectively) were developed. After Ca-Ba inoculation, the three irons were additional treated by stoichiometric equivalent additions of sulphur or oxygen as FeS 2 and Fe 2 O 3 respectively.

The effect of sulphur and oxygen on the standard and nonconventional <b>cooling</b> <b>curves</b> parameters were evaluated to a more deep understanding of the cast iron solidification mechanism. The <b>cooling</b> <b>curves</b> parameters are strongly influenced both by the initial residual Mg level of iron melt and afterwords sulphur/oxygen additions. A very complex and sometimes confused variation of the <b>cooling</b> <b>curves</b> parameters was recorded because of different actions of the three factors (iron melt modifying potential, sulphur and oxygen).

50|$|Below the {{transition}} temperature range, the glassy structure does not relax {{in accordance with}} the cooling rate used. The expansion coefficient for the glassy state is roughly equivalent to that of the crystalline solid. If slower cooling rates are used, the increased time for structural relaxation (or intermolecular rearrangement) to occur may result in a higher density glass product. Similarly, by annealing (and thus allowing for slow structural relaxation) the glass structure in time approaches an equilibrium density corresponding to the supercooled liquid at this same temperature. Tg is located at the intersection between the <b>cooling</b> <b>curve</b> (volume versus temperature) for the glassy state and the supercooled liquid.|$|E

A sample of liquid metal is removed from the furnace or ladle and poured into a sample cup with a thermocouple embedded in it. The temperature is then monitored, and the phase diagram arrests (liquidus, eutectic, and solidus) are noted. From this information chemical composition based on the phase diagram can be calculated, or the crystalline structure of the cast sample can be estimated especially for silicon morphology in hypo-eutectic Al-Si cast alloys. [...] Strictly speaking these measurements are cooling curves and a form of sample controlled thermal analysis whereby the cooling rate of the sample is dependent on the cup material (usually bonded sand) and sample volume which is normally a constant due to the use of standard sized sample cups.To detect phase evolution and corresponding characteristic temperatures,cooling curve and its first derivative curve should be considered simultaneously. Examination of cooling and derivative curves is done by using appropriate data analysis software.
