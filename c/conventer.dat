50|$|The {{municipality}} {{runs from}} the Baltic Sea coast for almost 5 km southeast into the interior. Within its territory is the <b>Conventer</b> See, an old bay whose outlet to the Baltic has silted up {{turning it into a}} lake. The lake is a nature reserve which is known for its variety of waders and water fowl. To the west of Börgerende is Germany's oldest seaside resort, Heiligendamm.|$|E

Supaya sinyal analog dapat diproses oleh komputer maka sinyal-sinyal tersebut hares diubah ke bentuk sinyal Pengubahan sinyal ini dilakukan oleh suatu {{interface}} yang dinamakan ADC (Analog to Digital <b>Conventer).</b> Setelah sinyal dikonversi ke bentuk digital, sinyal diproses oleh komputer. Proses di dalam komputer dilakukan oleh PPI (Programmabel Peripheral Interface) 8255, yang diubah ke sinyal digital. Supaya output yang dihasilkan oleh komputer berupa sinyal analog, maka sinyal digital basil pemrosesan PH 8255 dikonversi lagi ke bentuk analog oleh DAC (Digital to Analog <b>Conventer).</b> Sistem pengolahan sinyal yang dihasilkan dalam penulisan ini menggunakan bahasa pemrograman Turbo Pascal 7. 0 serta bahasa Assembler untuk perancangan perangkat lunaknya. Most {{of signal}} were found analog signal. The analog signals can't be processed by computer because {{the process that}} occur iu computer is digitally process. So the analog signal must be changed into digital signal if the analog signal want to be processed. The signal nringt be changed by an interface which was named as ADC (Analog to Digital <b>Conventer).</b> After signal was converted to digital form, signal being processed by computer. This processing are worked by PH (Programmable Peripheral Interface) 8255. The product by PH process is digital signal. In order to get output ini analog signal, the digital signal which had been producted by PPI 8255 will be converted again become analog form by DAC (Digital to Analog <b>Conventer).</b> The Processing signal system have used Turbo Pascal 7. 0 and Assembler for software design.. 	.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this bachelor's thesis was to apprise with the elevator control unit and to design a <b>conventer</b> to communicate with a server. Next objective was to design a program to collect and store information sent by the elevator control unit and visualize it. This communication runs through the TCP/IP protocol and data are stored in a database and visualized through a web interface. Testing was done by a control unit, which partially replaces the elevator system...|$|E
