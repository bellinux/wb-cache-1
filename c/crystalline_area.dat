DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for melt-free transformation of bundles from polycrystalline fibers into bundles of single crystalline fiber or of fibers with single <b>crystalline</b> <b>area,</b> comprises providing (1) bundles of fibers from polycrystalline material, laterally fanning out (3) the fiber bundles {{in such a way}} that the contacts of the fibers of the bundle are abated among each other, recrystallizing (4) the material contained in the fiber bundles in an oven zone at a temperature that lies below the melting temperature of the fiber material, cooling the fiber bundles, and rolling up (5) the fiber bundles on a cover or simultaneously cutting the fibers of bundles or all bundles vertically to fiber direction {{in such a way that}} short fibers are received. The fibers are transported over a transport line on which the fanning out takes place, where the fanning out takes place by electrostatic loading of the fibers by guiding the fiber bundles through column between two oppositively loaded electrodes, tightening and relaxing the fibers of the fiber bundles in oscillating manner, guiding the fibers through a compressed air pillow and recrystallizing the fibers in a hot gas stream. The process is continuously carried out and the fiber bundle tension is constantly held over the temperature line. The hot gas stream through which the fiber bundle is guided for recrystallization has a temperature of 0. 8 - 0. 85 T of melt related to the absolute melting temperature of the fiber. The hot gas stream is generated through the combustion of propane-oxygen-mixture containing inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. The transport speed of the fiber bundle is 150 - 300 mm/h and/or the fiber bundle tension is 0. 2 - 0. 1 N. The tightening and relaxing of the fiber is carried out by a spiked roller. The fiber bundle tension is adjusted by redirection rods, tensor roller, spring sheet metal and/or transport roller pair in a value of 0. 15 - 0. 18 N.

This study investigated the adsorption kinetics involved, using isothermal adsorption equations. Cellulose binding domains (CBDs) were isolated from a commercial cellulase, and their role in the adsorption and enzymatic reaction was evaluated. Approximately 13 % to 24 % of the refining energy was saved after northern bleached softwood kraft pulp samples were pretreated with full cellulase, CBDs, or cellulase lacking CBDs under optimal conditions. The absence of CBDs in cellulase resulted in less effective enzyme adsorption and hydrolysis of the fibers. These data suggest that pretreatment of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp with CBDs may not only improve the beating degree of the pulp and reduce refining energy consumption but also improve the tensile index of the handsheet.

Although long-term data of the lake show a declining trend in total phosphorus concentrations and phytoplankton biovolume, the response of Piburger See to the restoration measures carried out in 1970 was delayed by about 20 years. At present the lake is approaching its former oligotrophic level. The most evident difference between {{the past and present}} phytoplankton species composition of Piburger See is the actual absence of the Cyanophycean Oscillatoria limosa C. A. Agardh, which markedly increased during the first two decades after the lake restoration (1970 - 1987). The phytoplankton biovolume recorded in 1998 was lower than in the 1970 s and 1980 s, while seasonal patterns were similar to those recorded before and later on in the lake restoration. The lowest annual phytoplankton biovolume in 1998 occurred in early winter, while the absolute maximum was observed in metalimnetic water layers in late spring. In 1998 the intra-annual patterns of phytoplankton biovolume and chlorophyll-a compare well. Phytoplankton succession started in early 1998 under ice with coccal green algae followed by flagellated Chrysophyceae during spring. The mid-summer phytoplankton community was dominated by centric Bacillariophyceae, which were later replaced by coccal Cyanophyceae. During autumn, Dinophyceae and Chrysophyceae prevailed. Epilimnetic dominance of centric diatoms during mid summer appears to be a new feature, which in 1998 was related to a strong depletion of dissolved silica and nitrate. Long-term water chemistry and phytoplankton data were checked against local weather data in order to explain the delay in the re-oligotrophication process of Piburger See.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{drilling}} a horizontal well is to enhance productivity or injectory {{by placing a}} long distance drain-hole within the pay-zone. Poor drilling fluid design results in difficulties such as poor hole cleaning, excessive torque or drag, wellbore instability, stuck drill string, loss of circulation, subsurface pressure control, poor cement jobs, and difficulties associated with running electric logs and formation damage can result. Neither of the conventional chemical cleaning methods can overcome problems for filter-cake removal in long horizontal and maximum reservoir contact wells because of limitations such as the complex geometry of wells, non-uniform chemical distribution, low contact between cleaning fluids/filter cake, and high chemical reaction rate, especially at high temperatures. This study describes a novel self-destructing drilling fluid system. Filter cakes are formed from a formula of drilling fluid that have a mixture of solid acid precursor and particulate solid acid-reactive materials. Then {{in the presence of}} water, the solid acid precursor (polylactic acid) hydrolyzes and dissolves, generating acids that then dissolve the solid acid-reactive materials (calcite). It effectively stimulates the horizontal section right after drilling and eliminates acidizing, resulting in significant cost savings, and improves filter-cake removal, thus enhancing the performance of the treated wells. A series of experiments have been run in the lab to determine the efficiency of this new system. Properties of this drilling fluid are measured. Experiments on solid acid particle size showed that the best size-distribution of solid acid precursor and solid reactive material to make a self-destructing filter cake is fine particles of calcium carbonate used as weighting material with 150 microns polylactic acid as solid acid precursor. By comparison {{of the results of the}} experiments at different temperatures, 230 degrees F has been chosen as the best temperature for running experiments. The self-destructing drilling fluid systems need enough time for the solid acid to be hydrolyzed and therefore remove the filter cake. After 20 hours of contact with the water as the only cleaning solution, about 80 percent of the filter cake was removed. Calcite is found to be the dominant compound in the sample of remained filter cake, which was proved by x-ray diffraction tests.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports the}} results of optical studies of epitaxial (e), polycrystalline (p) and amorphous (a) Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 (GST) thin films. The dynamic properties of GST films in all three (e/p/a) phases were investigated by a time-resolved optical pump-probe technique in which a femtosecond pump pulse of 55 fs duration was used to excite the sample. The intensity and polarization of the reflected probe beam respectively provide information about the transient reflectance (R) and anisotropic reflectance (AR) induced in the sample, that in turn provide {{the information about the}} crystal structure, phonon spectrum, and ultimately phase transitions within the sample. The study of an epitaxial sample provides an opportunity to explore the character of the modes within the phonon spectrum. The epitaxial GST film was grown upon a homoepitaxial layer of GaSb grown upon a GaSb wafer. We observed a 6. 7 THz coherent optical phonon (COP) in GaSb(001). The dependence of the signal strength upon the pump and probe polarization was explained in terms of a model that considered both Transient stimulated Raman Scattering (TSRS) and the action of a Surface Space-Charge (SSC) field. The presence of the 6. 7 THz transverse COP in the AR channel and its four fold dependence on pump and probe polarization suggests a three-dimensional T 2 character. The COP amplitude was maximum when the probe was polarized parallel to the cube edge (GaSb[100]) and the pump polarization was set parallel to a face diagonal (GaSb[110]). The results were fully understood using a microscopic model of selective bond breaking. The AR response of e-GST/GaSb(001) reveals the presence of a 3 D 3. 4 THz transverse optical phonon. The mode amplitude was independent of pump polarization indicating that the mode is excited by a SSC field. This SSC field could exist within the GST, if the distorted rock-salt structure of GST lacks inversion symmetry, or GaSb, which has the non-centrosymmetric zincblende structure, leading to impulsive excitation of phonons at the GST/GaSb interface. The mode in GST was inferred to be T 2 -like. The observation of a T 2 -like phonon mode confirms that GST is cubic in structure and challenges previous studies where 1 D or 2 D character was assigned to the 3. 4 THz mode. While pump-probe measurements displayed the presence of a 3 D 3. 4 THz mode in the AR response of e-GST/GaSb(001), a 4. 5 THz mode was observed in both R and AR channels for p-GST(37 nm) /Si(001) and a-GST(57 nm) /Si(001). The mode character was identified to be either of A or E type by comparing the frequency with frequencies reported in the literature. Additional Raman microscope measurements confirmed the presence of the modes observed in the pump-probe measurements and also revealed additional frequencies. The differences in the frequencies observed from the different samples are quite small suggesting the presence of similar bonds that are modified to some extent by the different structural environment found within each sample. After exposure to high pump fluence the original modes disappeared and were replaced by new modes with frequencies at 4. 2 THz and 3. 1 THz in e-GaSb, 4. 2 THz in e-GST, 3. 5 THz in p-GST and 3. 6 THz in a-GST. The difference in the final frequencies observed for p and a-GST sample may result from the difference in stack structure affecting the time-dependent temperature profile in each sample. The dependence of the temperature profile on the sample stack was understood from an experimental study of the phase transition between the amorphous and crystalline states induced by exposure to a series of amplified laser pulses. The dependence of the <b>crystalline</b> <b>area</b> and its reflectivity upon the number of pulses and fluence was described using a simple algebraic model. The results justify the assumption of one-dimensional heat flow. The growth velocity of the crystalline region was calculated to be 7 - 9 m/s. Apparatus and methods were developed to extend the time-resolved optical studies described previously. Firstly, an apparatus was constructed for the measurement of the wavelength dependent sample reflectance with a white-light pulse. A reference arm was employed to allow normalization and hence removal of the intensity noise arising in the laser regenerative amplifier system. Secondly an electrical measurement apparatus was constructed to allow combined electro-optical measurements in future. Switching of GST vertical memory cells was successfully demonstrated. The cells were fabricated on a borosilicate substrate with TiW top and bottom electrodes. A DC voltage of 4. 5 to 6 V was required to induce switching, while in pulsed measurements, the device demonstrated switching in response to a pulse with minimum duration of 100 ns...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2013. Major: Chemical Engineering. Advisor: K. Andre Mkhoyan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 167 pages, appendices A-E. Very {{detailed information about}} the atomic and electronic structure of materials can be obtained via atomic-scale resolution {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM). These experiments reach the limits of current microscopes, which means that optimal experimental design is a key ingredient in success. The step following experiment, extraction of information from experimental data is also complex. Comprehension of experimental data depends on comparison with simulated data and on fundamental understanding of aspects of scattering behavior. The research projects discussed in this thesis are formulated within three large concepts. 1. Usage of simulation to suggest experimental technique for observation of a particular structural feature. Two specific structural features are explored. One is the characterization of a substitutional dopant atom in a crystal. Annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (ADF-STEM) images allow detection of individual dopant atoms in a crystal based on contrast between intensities of doped and non-doped column in the image. The magnitude of the said contrast is heavily influenced by specimen and microscope parameters. Analysis of multislice-based simulations of ADF-STEM images of crystals doped with one substitutional dopant atom {{for a wide range of}} crystal thicknesses, types and locations of dopant atom inside the crystal, and crystals with different atoms revealed trends and non-intuitive behaviors in visibility of the dopant atom. The results provide practical guidelines for the optimal experimental setup regarding both the microscope and specimen conditions in order to characterize the presence and location of a dopant atom. Furthermore, the simulations help in recognizing the cases where detecting a single dopant atom via ADF-STEM imaging is not possible. The second is a more specific case of detecting intrinsic twist in MoS 2 nanotubes. Objective molecular dynamics simulations coupled with a density functional-based tight-binding model revealed that a stress-free single-walled (14, 6) MoS 2 nanotube has a torsional deformation of 0. 87 °/nm. Comparison between simulated electron diffraction patterns and atomic-resolution ADF-STEM images of nanotubes with and without the small twist suggested that these experimental techniques are viable routes for detecting presence of the torsional deformation. 2. Development of theory to cast light on aspects of scattering behavior that affect STEM data. STEM probe intensity oscillates as the probe transmits through a crystalline sample. The oscillatory behavior of the probe is extremely similar during transmission through 3 -D crystals and the hypothetical structure of an isolated column of atoms, a 1 -D crystal. This indicates that the physical origin of oscillation in intensity is not due to scattering of electrons away from one atomic column and subsequent scattering back from neighboring columns. It leaves in question what the physical origin or intensity oscillation is. This question was answered here by analysis of electron beam behavior in isolated atomic columns, examined via multislice-based simulations. Two physical origins, changes in angular distribution of the probe and phase shift between the angular components, were shown to cause oscillation in beam intensity. Sensitivity of frequency of oscillation to different probe and sample parameters was used to better understand the influence of the two physical origins on probe oscillation. 3. Acquisition of atomic-scale STEM data to answer specific questions about a material. Graphene, due to its 2 -Dimensionality, and due to its thermal, optical, electrical, and mechanical properties, which are conducive to providing a unique material for incorporation in devices, has gained a lot of interest in the research world and even spurred start-ups. There are several feasible routes of graphene synthesis, among which chemical exfoliation of graphite is a promising method for mass-scale, low-cost production of graphene. Chemical exfoliation of graphite to produce graphene is a two-step process: oxidation to exfoliate the graphite layers, which results in graphene oxide, and reduction of graphene oxide, to produce graphene as a final product. Here, we examined the atomic and electronic structure of graphene oxide and of the reduced sheets. Two different methods of reduction, thermal reduction in vacuum and aqueous reduction in atmosphere, were compared. TEM-based techniques were used for nanoscale characterization. GO was synthesized using the modified Hummer's method and presence of single layer sheets was confirmed by electron diffraction (ED). Non-uniform distribution of oxygen in GO was observed using Z-contrast imaging in STEM. Presence of sp 2 and sp 3 hybridized carbon bonds in GO was confirmed by examining the fine structure of carbon K-edge in electron energy loss spectra (EELS). Changes in oxygen distribution and electronic structure of carbon were monitored using the same techniques in situ during thermal reduction of GO to graphene. Change in oxygen level and carbon hybridization was gradual with increasing temperature, with complete conversion to oxygen-absent, sp 2 hybridized carbon sheet at 1000 &# 778;C. Gradual change confirmed the ability to fine-tune the level of oxygen on carbon sheets using thermal reduction in vacuum. Instantaneous heating from room temperature to 1000 &# 778;C showed formation of holes in the graphene product. A several-hour gradual heating process was suggested to decrease perforation in graphene sheets. The second reduction process, aqueous thermal reduction in ambient pressure, did not lead to completely sp 2 hybridized carbon sheets, observed using EELS. Presence of oxygen was also observed via x-ray photoemission spectra (XPS). Yet, electrical resistance of the product was 5 orders of magnitude less than the starting GO sheets. This property was explained by examining the atomic structure of the reduced GO. High resolution conventional TEM (CTEM) images of nano-scale section of the reduced GO showed randomly shaped crystalline areas and amorphous areas, with <b>crystalline</b> <b>area</b> being above the 2 -D percolation threshold and thus explaining the conductive property...|$|E
40|$|Amidos pré-gelatinizados podem ser usados em aplicações de produtos de conveniência pela indústria de alimentos, pois apresentam maior solubilidade em água fria e menor temperatura de gelatinização. As modificações físicas por {{spray drying}} e por extrusão são métodos que podem resultar em alterações na região cristalina, com mudanças nas propriedades térmicas e de pasta dos amidos. Objetivou-se neste trabalho verificar as alterações estruturais e funcionais provocadas, pelos métodos de modificações físicas citados, nos amidos de {{mandioca}}, mandioquinha-salsa e batata-doce. A modificação por spray drying foi realizada com aquecimento da suspensão à 57 °C e concentração de 8 % de amido, com temperatura de saída e vazão no spray dryer, respectivamente, de 105 °C e 0, 5 L h- 1. A modificação por extrusão foi realizada no amido a 20 % de umidade, temperaturas de 25, 50 e 75 ºC, respectivamente, na 1 a zona, 2 ª zona e 3 ª zona do extrusor e rotação de 245 rpm. Após a finalização deste experimento, os resultados evidenciaram que a modificação por spray drying provocou alterações menos severas nas características dos amidos estudados. Sendo assim, foi realizado um segundo experimento com os amidos de mandioca e batata-doce a fim de determinar as melhores condições de processo da modificação por spray drying, seguindo planejamento experimental central composto rotacional nos dois ensaios experimentais. Os amidos modificados no primeiro experimento foram analisados em relação as características estruturais e propriedades de pasta e térmica. A modificação por spray drying não provocou alterações no teor de amilose, massa molecular e raio médio de giro, assim como na distribuição dos comprimentos das cadeias ramificadas de amilopectina, mostrando que não houve degradação das ligações glicosídicas. Houve redução dos picos do padrão de difração de Raios X dos amidos, refletindo na diminuição na cristalinidade relativa. A morfologia dos grânulos apresentou aglomerados para os amidos de mandioca e mandioquinha-salsa, indicando gelatinização parcial dos grânulos. O amido de mandioquinha-salsa modificado por spray drying apresentou aumento na viscosidade a frio e diminuição da viscosidade de pico e final. Para todos os amidos, houve aumento no setback (tendência a retrogradação). As temperaturas de gelatinização não sofreram alterações significativas, porém a variação da temperatura diminuiu, assim como a variação da entalpia. Os amidos modificados por extrusão não apresentaram alteração no teor de amilose e na distribuição dos comprimentos das cadeias ramificadas da amilopectina, no entanto, houve alteração na massa molecular e no raio médio de giro, indicando provável rompimento das ligações glicosídicas. Os amidos modificados por extrusão apresentaram redução total dos picos do padrão de difração dos amidos, indicando total gelatinização. Nas imagens de microscopia eletrônica de varredura não foram observados grânulos para todos os tratamentos, confirmando a gelatinização total do amido com perda da estrutura granular durante o processo de extrusão, o que também foi observado pela ausência de curva de gelatinização na análise de propriedade térmica. Tais alterações levaram a um aumento na viscosidade a frio. As modificações por spray drying e extrusão resultam em amidos com diferentes propriedades, sendo que o amido modificado por spray drying seria indicado para produtos que necessitem de consistência mais firme, enquanto o amido modificado por extrusão seria indicado para produtos com viscosidade a frio e com consistência mais fluída. Em relação aos amidos estudados, o amido de mandioquinha-salsa apresentou maior sensibilidade ao processo, devido sua temperatura de gelatinização ser próxima às temperaturas utilizadas, e também, pelo defeito na área cristalina. Os resultados obtidos no segundo experimento evidenciaram que as melhores condições de modificação dos amidos de mandioca e de batata-doce por spray drying são: alta temperatura (60 °C) e baixa concentração (5 %). Nas condições citadas, podem ser obtidos amidos modificados por spray drying com boas características de pasta e térmica, como leve viscosidade a frio, consistência no produto final e temperatura de gelatinização uniforme, refletindo em melhor utilização de energia no processo. Pregelatinized starches {{can be used}} in applications of convenience products by the food industry, since they have greater solubility in cold water and low gelatinization temperature. The physical modification by spray drying and extrusion are methods which can result in changes in the crystalline region, with changes in the thermal and pasting properties of starch. The aim of this work was to verify the structural and functional changes caused by physical modification methods mentioned in starches from cassava, Peruvian carrot and sweet potato. The modification by spray drying was performed using temperature of 57 °C and concentration of 8 %, with outlet temperature and feed rate in spray dryer of 105 °c and 0. 5 L h- 1, respectively. The modification by extrusion was carried out with 20 % of starch moisture, with temperatures of 25 °C, 50 °C and 75 °C in the 1 st zone, 2 nd zone and 3 rd zone respectively, and rotation 245 rpm. After completion of this experiment, the results show that the modification by spray drying caused less severe changes in the characteristics of the studied starches. Thus, it was conducted a second experiment with starches from cassava and sweet potato, {{in order to determine the}} best process conditions of modification by spray drying, following experimental design central composite rotational in both experimental tests. The modified starches of the first experiment were analyzed for structural characteristics and thermal and pasting properties. The modification by spray drying caused no changes in the amylose content, molecular weight and the average gyration radius, and distribution branch chains-length of amylopectin showing that there was no degradation of glycosides bonds. There was reduction of the peaks of the diffraction pattern of starches, reflecting in decrease of relative crystallinity. The morphology of the granules showed agglomerates for the starches of cassava and Peruvian carrot, indicating partial gelatinization of the granules. Modified starch of Peruvian carrot by spray drying showed increase in cold viscosity and decrease in peak and final viscosity. For all starches, there was increase in setback. The temperatures of gelatinization no showed significant changes, although the temperature range decrease, as well as the enthalpy change. Modified starches by extrusion no show change in the amylose content and the distribution of branch chains-length of amylopectin, however, changes were observed in the molecular weight and the average gyration radius, indicating likely breaking of glycosidic bonds. Modified starches by extrusion showed total reduction in peaks of the diffraction pattern of the starches, indicating complete gelatinization of starches. In scanning electron microscopy observed no granules, confirming complete gelatinization of the starch, with loss of granular structure during the extrusion process, which also were observed by absence of gelatinization curve in thermal analysis. These changes leaded to increase of cold viscosity. The modifications by spray drying and extrusion resulted in starches with different properties, being the modified starch by spray drying can be indicated to apply in products that need of firmness consistency, and the modified starch by extrusion may be indicated to apply in products with cold viscosity and less consistency. Among of studied starches, Peruvian carrot starch showed be more susceptible for both process, due to its gelatinization temperature to be near the temperatures used in these experiments, and due to its defect in <b>crystalline</b> <b>area.</b> The results obtained in the second experiment show that the best conditions for modification of starches of cassava and sweet potato by spray drying are: high temperature (60 °C) and low concentration (5 %). In these conditions can be obtained modified starches by spray drying with good pasting and thermal properties, as the cold viscosity, consistency in final product and gelatinization temperature uniform between the granules, reflecting in better utilization of energy by process...|$|E

Polarized light microscopy enables to structural investigations, <b>crystalline</b> <b>areas</b> appear as bright zones in the photographies. Gun propellants consist of different ingredients e. g. like nitrocellulose, plasticizers, stabilizers and others. An appropriate plasticizer forms together with the nitrocellulose a gel. This process of gelation may be supported by using a good solvent for nitrocellulose during the manufacturing process. The interaction between nitrocellulose and plasticiser can be studied by polarised light microscopy. As pure material nitrocellulose has a fibrous structure and shows some <b>crystalline</b> <b>areas.</b> If a gel is formed consisting of nitrocellulose and an appropriate plasticizer then the material will get amorphous. At ICT there were investigated different gun propellants by polarized light microscopy. Therefore the samples were cut in very small slices (5 - 10 µm) and than put under the microscope. The magnification lies in the region of 1 to 1000 µm. In the following pictures there are shown some results by investigating different gun propellants. The fibrous crystalline structure of the (not gelled) nitrocellulose can be still seen to some extent in all cases...|$|R

A distinction is made here between rock complexes, commonly referred to as [...] "slate belts" [...] (German: [...] ) made of unmetamorphosed or weakly metamorphosed rocks (slate, chert, sandstone, limestone, altered basalt, phyllite and quartzite) which are intruded only to a small extent by granitoids, and rock complexes commonly referred to as crystalline, comprising weakly to highly metamorphosed rocks (phyllite, quartzite, marble, amphibolite, serpentinite, schist, gneiss, granulite and eclogite) which are extensively intruded by granitoids. The slate belt rock units were folded at a shallow depth at relatively low temperatures, whereas the metamorphic <b>crystalline</b> <b>areas</b> sank much deeper during the Variscan Orogeny, and were subjected to high pressures and, in some places, very high temperatures which caused partial melting of the rocks. The geochemical signature of the Variscan granitoids suggests that their magma was produced by the partial melting of deeply-buried sedimentary rocks. Outcropping slate belts are found mainly in the Rhenish Massif, the Harz and the Thuringian-Franconian-Vogtland Slate Mountains.

40|$|Brannerite, UTi 2 O 6 is {{the most}} {{important}} uranium mineral after uraninite, UO 2 and coffinite, U(SiO 4) 1 -x(OH) 4 x. It is also the most common refractory uranium mineral. Ores containing brannerite typically require intense conditions (> 50 g/L H 2 SO 4, > 75 °C) compared to other uranium ores for effective uranium extraction to occur. To develop an effective process for the extraction of uranium from brannerite containing ores and improve the extraction from the ores currently being processed, it is necessary to understand the chemistry of the brannerite leaching process. As this study has shown, brannerite is typically an altered and amorphous mineral, with an extent of alteration depending on the age of the sample and the geological history of the deposit. A sample of brannerite from Cordoba, Spain, was leached over a range of conditions in acidic ferric sulphate media. The sample was filled with cracks and altered zones containing anatase (TiO 2). Process parameters studied included temperature (25 - 96 °C), acidity (10 - 200 g/L H 2 SO 4) and the effect of adding selected gangue minerals (apatite, fluorite and ilmenite). The feed and the leached residues were characterised in detail by XRD and SEM-EDX techniques. The results of this study showed that brannerite dissolution has a stronger dependence on temperature and lesser dependence on free acid concentration. Comparisons between the residues and the feed showed that the altered and amorphous areas of the brannerite sample are more readily leached than <b>crystalline</b> <b>areas.</b> The <b>crystalline</b> <b>areas</b> of the brannerite dissolved congruently, with titanium subsequently precipitating as anatase physically separated from the original brannerite grains...|$|R
