40|$|The master‘s {{thesis is}} {{focusing}} on cryptography based on elliptical curves consists of four main parts. The first part {{provides an overview of}} the basic cryptographic and mathematical concepts. A key element of this work is the second part which are described in detail the mechanisms of counting two points on elliptic curve and <b>counting</b> <b>point</b> to themselves over the various fields. On this mechanism is based almost the entire issue. In the third section provides the best-known algorithms and protocols for key exchange, encryption and digital signature. The goal {{of this paper is to}} devise software to support teaching. This material is created as a web presentation, which described the theoretical foundations and the main characteristics of cryptosystems based on elliptical curves. The whole issue is supported by practical examples of calculations examples, there are also examples for independent work. Additionally, java applets are prepared that allow an interactive opportunity to try the basic parameters of curves, or verify the calculations...|$|E

40|$|Two-photon laser-scanning {{microscopy}} has revolutionized {{our view}} on vital processes by revealing motility and interaction patterns of various cell subsets in hardly accessible organs (e. g. brain) in living animals. However, current technology is still insufficient to elucidate {{the mechanisms of}} organ dysfunction as a prerequisite for developing new therapeutic strategies, since it renders only sparse information about the molecular basis of cellular response within tissues in health and disease. In the context of imaging, Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET) {{is one of the}} most adequate tools to probe molecular mechanisms of cell function. As a calibration-free technique, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) is superior for quantifying FRET in vivo. Currently, its main limitation is the acquisition speed in the context of deep-tissue 3 D and 4 D imaging. Here we present a parallelized time-correlated single-photon <b>counting</b> <b>point</b> detector (p-TCSPC) (i) for dynamic single-beam scanning FLIM of large 3 D areas on the range of hundreds of milliseconds relevant in the context of immune-induced pathologies as well as (ii) for ultrafast 2 D FLIM in the range of tens of milliseconds, a scale relevant for cell physiology. We demonstrate its power in dynamic deep-tissue intravital imaging, as compared to multi-beam scanning time-gated FLIM suitable for fast data acquisition and compared to highly sensitive single-channel TCSPC adequate to detect low fluorescence signals. Using p-TCSPC, 256 × 256 pixel FLIM maps (300 × 300 µm(2)) are acquired within 468 ms while 131 × 131 pixel FLIM maps (75 × 75 µm(2)) can be acquired every 82 ms in 115 µm depth in the spinal cord of CerTN L 15 mice. The CerTN L 15 mice express a FRET-based Ca-biosensor in certain neuronal subsets. Our new technology allows us to perform time-lapse 3 D intravital FLIM (4 D FLIM) in the brain stem of CerTN L 15 mice affected by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and, thereby, to truly quantify neuronal dysfunction in neuroinflammation...|$|E
