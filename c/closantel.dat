40|$|<b>Closantel</b> is an anthe lmintic which {{associates}} with plasma albumin and {{is useful for}} the control of sheep parasites, such as Haemonchus contortus, that ingest blood. However, the utility of <b>closantel</b> for parasite control has been threatened {{by the emergence of}} resistance. The mechanisms of resistance are unknown. A closantel-resistant and a closantel-susceptible isolate of H. contortus were compared with respect to the distribution and metabolism of <b>closantel.</b> Neither strain appeared to metabolise <b>closantel</b> in vitro or in vivo. Following treatment of infected sheep with radioactively labelled <b>closantel,</b> isotope levels in closantel-resistant adult H. contortus were significantly lower than in susceptible worms.

This study evaluated the efficacy of <b>closantel</b> against F.  hepatica in naturally infected beef cattle using both coproantigen and faecal egg count reduction tests. Faecal egg counts (FEC) and coproantigen ELISA examinations were conducted in February 2014 in three beef cattle herds (A, B, C) in south-western Sweden. On each farm, 10 F.  hepatica coproantigen-positive and F.  hepatica egg-positive animals were allocated after 12 – 16 weeks of housing into groups and treated topically {{with a minimum of}} 20  mg <b>closantel</b> per kg body weight. Faecal samples were collected from selected animals on 0, 7 and 21  day post-treatment (PT). Based on FEC, <b>closantel</b> efficacy 21 days PT was 72 % (95 % CI: 65 – 77 %) and 97 % (95 % CI: 95 – 98 %) on farms A and B, respectively. No FEC reduction at all was observed on farm C. In total, 4, 1 and 6 animals remained coproantigen-positive at 21 days PT on farms A, B and C, respectively. <b>Closantel</b> treatment failure was confirmed on two of the farms. As the animals were housed 12 – 16  weeks before treatment and thereafter during the entire study, failure due to the presence of juvenile flukes was excluded. Although the cause of <b>closantel</b> failure currently remains unclear, development of resistance or/and absorption failure of topical administration should be considered.

40|$|On the {{strength}} of a complaint of suspected resistance to <b>closantel,</b> a field strain of Haemonchus contortus was isolated from sheep on a farm near Pretoria and tested for resistance to the remedy, both without exposure to <b>closantel</b> in the laboratory (designated the "unselected" substrain of the parasite) and after a single selection with <b>closantel</b> (called the "selected" substrain). For comparative purpose a few sheep were treated with rafoxanide to ascertain whether the efficacy of this drug was unchanged. While the unselected substrain appeared to show only slight increased resistance to the residual effect of <b>closantel</b> drenched at a dosage rate of 5 mg/kg, there was a dramatic increase in resistance after one selection. The, residual efficacy (determined by the modified NPM test of Groeneveld & Reinecke, 1969, as outlined by Reinecke, 1973), 13 - 14 days after treatment with <b>closantel</b> was reduced from the registered claim of the remedy in South Africa of > 80 % effective in > 80 % of the treated flock to "ineffective", or < 50 % effective in < 50 % of the treated flock. Furthermore, there also appeared to be a slight increase in the resistance of this substrain to rafoxanide, as its efficacy was reduced from 99 - 100 % to about 92 %. This sharp reduction in efficacy after a single selection with <b>closantel</b> seemed to indicate that the slight increase in resistance of the unselected substrain was probably due not to possible variation in the repeatability of the trail method but to repeated treatment with <b>closantel</b> on the farm.

40|$|Background: <b>Closantel</b> is a {{veterinary}} drug used as anthelmintic for ruminants {{while it is}} contraindicated for humans. This report describes a rare case of blindness, increased liver enzymes and coagulopathy following <b>closantel</b> poisoning. Case report: A 5 -year-old girl was presented with acute blindness following <b>closantel</b> poisoning. She was given mistakenly a dose of 500 mg/day (25 mg/kg/day) for 8 days. Clinical examination revealed a well-appearing child with bilateral mydriasis, loss of pupillary light reflex and absence of blinking to threat. Fundoscopic exam revealed bilateral pre-atrophic papilledema. Electroretinogram showed a highly significant decrease in retinal activity. Laboratory examinations revealed 52 % increase in prothrombin time, prolongation of {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} to 1. 3 times the normal and rise of aspartate aminotransferase to 120 IU/L. In addition, creatine kinase peaked at 904 IU/L. Moreover, normocytic normochromic anemia with hemoglobin at 10. 7 mg/L and leukocytosis with lymphocytic predominance was noted. The patient received glucocorticoids, vitamin B 12 and vitamin K and was discharged after correction of blood and coagulation parameters and normalization of liver enzymes. Partial recovery in visual acuity was found two months after ingestion of the last dose. Discussion:Closantel can cause significant spongiform change (intra-myelin vacuolation) in the white matter of the cerebrum and the cerebellum. It can also induce optic nerve damage as a result of Wallerian degeneration, fibrosis and atrophy. On the retina, <b>closantel</b> leads to papilledema, necrosis of the outer layers, and retinal detachment.

Drug concentrations were measured in samples collected sequentially from four batches of RF-AS fortified with either <b>closantel</b> or rafoxanide {{in one study}} and in four separately incubated aliquots of a RF-AS mixture of each drug in the second study at the start and at various intervals during a 24 h incubation period. The viability of the in vitro RF-AS incubation model was validated {{by the presence of}} digoxin degradation (T 1 / 2 of 39. 1 ± 13 h) and by the absence of significant time related differences (P> 0. 5) in volume of gas produced, pH and methylene blue reduction time of the RF-AS drug mixture. Partitioning of <b>closantel</b> and rafoxanide was determined by measuring the relative drug concentration of the fluid and particulate phases in RF fortified with either drug at different concentrations. <b>Closantel</b> and rafoxanide were shown to be stable in a RF-AS mixture and were not subjected to any significant biodegradation. An initial marked reduction in drug concentration measured in the RF-AS mixture during the first 2 h of incubation was attributed to the attachment of both drugs onto particulate matter.

The outbreak {{occurred in a}} group of 1300 weaning lambs treated orally with a 10 % solution of <b>Closantel.</b> One hundred forty eight lambs showed clinical signs of intoxication and 14 died. The clinical signs included mydriasis, nystagmus, and negative pupillary reflex, bilateral blindness, bump into objects, and lateral movement of the head. No macroscopic lesions were observed. The histological lesions of the retina were cytoplasmic vacuolization in ganglion cells and in cells of the inner and outer nuclear layers with different degrees of atrophy. Vacuolization and axonal degeneration were observed in the optic nerve, with multifocal areas of fibrosis and infiltration by lymphocytes and Gitter cells. To reproduce the intoxication, four sheep were given two, four and 10 times the therapeutic dose of <b>Closantel</b> (0. 1 g/kg of BW). Only the animals receiving 10 times the recommended dose showed clinical signs. The histological examination of the lesions in experimental sheep showed similar results to those described in the accidental outbreak, except for the absence of optic nerve fibrosis and inflammation, characterizing an acute phase. Axonal myelin sheaths loss, fibroblasts and collagen fibers were observed in the ultrastructural study of the optic nerve of accidental intoxicated animals. The optic nerve of experimentally intoxicated animals had vacuoles that separated the myelin sheaths of axons.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: The L 3 -stage-specific {{chitinase}} OvCHT 1 {{has been}} implicated {{in the development of}} Onchocerca volvulus, the causative agent of onchocerciasis. <b>Closantel,</b> a known anthelmintic drug, was previously discovered as a potent and specific OvCHT 1 inhibitor. As <b>closantel</b> is also a known protonophore, we performed a simple scaffold modulation to map out the structural features that are relevant for its individual or dual biochemical roles. Furthermore, we present that either OvCHT 1 inhibition or protonophoric activity was capable of affecting O. volvulus L 3 molting and that the presence of both activities in a single molecule yielded more potent inhibition of the nematode’s developmental process. Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, has plagued over 37 million people worldwide, occurring mostly in the sub-Saharan Africa, Yemen, and isolated areas of Central and South America. 1 The culprit for the infection is the filarial nematode Onchocerc...|$|E
40|$|A {{possible}} {{link between}} the level of glutathione S-transferase (GST, E. C. 2. 5. 1. 18) activity {{and the development of}} salicylanilide resistance in Fasciola hepatica was investigated. Various isolates of F. hepatica with varying susceptibilities to salicylanilides were isolated and maintained in the laboratory. Individual flukes of these isolates were surveyed for their level of GST activity and a correlation between the level of GST activity and drug efficacy was found. In contrast to most other studies, a decrease in GST activity was associated with an increase in drug resistance. Evidence was collected to show that this may be a selective process since flukes which had survived exposure to rafoxanide and <b>closantel</b> in vivo (in sheep) had lower activity levels of GST than flukes from untreated sheep. Treatment with other flukicides (oxyclozanide, luxabendazole and triclabendazole) did not have this effect. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with <b>closantel</b> induced selection of particular isoenzymes in different isolates of F. hepatica having different degrees of susceptibility to <b>closantel.</b> However, no single isoenzyme or isoenzyme profile was associated with resistance and, in total, up to 8 different isoenzymes could be present in a single isolate. Thus, GST has some potential as a marker enzyme for salicylanilide resistance in F. hepatica. However, the precise role of GST in resistance is unclear and the extensive inter- and intra-isolate variation in activity levels and isoenzyme characteristics of this enzyme indicate the need for considerably more study before application in field situations...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of different drugs in the control of parasites of sheep belonging to the Centro Agropecuário da Palma, Universidade Federal de Pelotas, municipality of Capão do Leão, RS. Seventy-eight female Corriedale and Ideal sheep with an initial body weight of 48. 35 ± 4. 71 kg were randomly selected and divided into six groups submitted to the following treatments: control treatment and treated with 34 %nitroxynil, 18. 8 % levamisole hydrochloride, 10 % <b>closantel,</b> 1 % moxidectin, and 10 % fenbendazole. The drugs were administered according to the recommendations of the manufacturers. Fecal samples were collected before (day 0) and after treatment (days 7, 4, 21 and 28) and were used for the determination of fecal egg count (FEC) in the different groups. Efficacy was evaluated based on the percentage reduction in FEC and percent efficacy of the drugs. The fecal samples were processed for coproculture to identify the parasite genera present in the herd. The percentages of efficacy observed on day 28 post-treatment were 96. 93 % for nitroxynil, 95. 8 % for levamisole hydrochloride, 95. 5 % for <b>closantel,</b> 80. 2 % for moxidectin, and 27. 5 % for fenbendazole. The nematode species present in the herd was Haemonchus spp. (100 %). Nitroxynil, <b>closantel</b> and levamisole hydrochloride were effective in eliminating gastrointestinal nematodes.

40|$|Abstract The fast {{anthelmintic}} resistance {{development has}} shown a limited efficiency in the control of animal’s endoparasitosis and has promoted research using alternative control methods. The use of chemicals in animal anthelmintic treatment, in association with nematophagous fungi used for biological control, is a strategy that {{has proven to be}} effective in reducing the nematode population density in farm animals. This study aims to verify the in vitro susceptibility of the nematophagous fungi Arthrobotrys oligospora, Duddingtonia flagrans and Paecilomyces lilacinus against the antiparasitic drugs albendazole, thiabendazole, ivermectin, levamisole and <b>closantel</b> by using the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). MICs ranged between 4. 0 and 0. 031 µg/mL for albendazole, thiabendazole and ivermectin, between 0. 937 and 0. 117 µg/mL for levamisole, and between 0. 625 and 0. 034 µg/mL for <b>closantel.</b> The results showed that all antiparasitic drugs had an in vitro inhibitory effect on nematophagous fungi, which could compromise their action as agents of biological control. D. flagrans was the most susceptible species to all drugs...|$|E
40|$|Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is a {{neglected}} tropical disease {{caused by the}} filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus that affects more than 37  million people, mainly in third world countries. Currently, the only approved drug available for mass treatment is ivermectin, however, drug resistance is beginning to emerge, thus, new therapeutic targets and agents are desperately needed to treat and cure this devastating disease. Chitin metabolism plays {{a central role in}} invertebrate biology due to the critical structural function of chitin for the organism. Taken together with its absence in mammals, targeting chitin is an appealing therapeutic avenue. Importantly, the chitinase OvCHT 1 from O. volvulus was recently discovered, however, its exact role in the worm’s metabolism remains unknown. A screening effort against OvCHT 1 was conducted using the Johns Hopkins Clinical Compound Library that contains over 1, 500 existing drugs. <b>Closantel,</b> a veterinary anthelmintic with known proton ionophore activities, was identified as a potent and specific inhibitor of filarial chitinases, an activity not previously reported for this compound. Notably, <b>closantel</b> was found also to completely inhibit molting of O. volvulus infective L 3 stage larvae. <b>Closantel</b> appears to target two important biochemical processes essential to filarial parasites. To begin to unravel closantel’s effects, a retro-fragment-based study was used to define structural elements critical for closantel’s chitinase inhibitor function. As resources towards the development of new agents that target neglected tropical diseases are scant, the finding of an existing drug with impact against O. volvulus provides promise in the hunt for new therapies against river blindness...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} on the occurrence of anthelmintic resistance of nematodes in communally grazed sheep in a semi-arid area near Mafikeng, South Africa, from January to March 2006. In the herds belonging to twelve smallholder sheep farmers, the efficacies of albendazole, levamisole and <b>closantel</b> were tested by faecal egg count reduction tests where 80 % efficacy was considered the cut off for anthelmintic resistance. The results of the faecal egg count reduction tests showed more than 80 % efficacy with all the drugs used in most cases, but there were notable exceptions. In 1 case, <b>closantel</b> had an efficacy of 72 %, albendazole had an efficacy of 68 % and levamisole showed efficacies of 58 %, 60 % and 75 % respectively on 4 farms. The occurrence of anthelmintic resistance in this farming sector is of concern and steps should be taken to prevent its further spread and development to avoid a situation developing as on numerous commercial sheep farms in South Africa where resistance is common...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Fasciolosis is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by Fasciola spp. {{of the family}} Fasciolidae (trematodes) characterized by bottle jaw, anemia, progressive debility, and potbelly condition. There are many aspects of fasciolosis remaining unknown thus hemato-biochemical alterations in <b>closantel,</b> triclabendazole + ivermectin, and oxyclozanide + levamisole treated goats were studied. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 naturally fasciolosis infected goats having egg per gram more than 100 were randomly divided into four groups. Goats of Group I-III were treated with three different anthelmintics, whereas, goats of Group-IV were kept as control or untreated. Whole blood, serum, and fecal samples were collected on 0, 7 th, and 30 th day of treatment. Results: During the study, values of hemoglobin, total erythrocyte count, pack cell volume, and total protein were significantly elevated to their normal levels in anthelmintics treated groups. Whereas, values of total leukocyte count, aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were significantly reduced to their normal level in anthelmintics treated groups. The efficacy of <b>closantel</b> (T 1), triclabendazole + ivermectin (T 2), and oxyclozanide + levamisole (T 3) was 99. 63...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Sc. Agric in Animal Science) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2011 A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the occurrence of anthelmintic resistance of nematodes in communally grazed sheep and goat herds in the Zeerust area of the North-West Province, Republic of South Africa. The fecal egg count reduction test (FECR%) tests {{were used to assess}} the sheep and goat small holder farmers. Efficacy of albendazole, ivermectin and <b>closantel</b> was done on both the treatment and control animals. Anthelmintic efficacy of 80 % was considered a threshold for anthelmintic resistance. The FECR% showed that all drugs tested more than 80 % effective in most instances, but there were some notable exceptions. For instance in sheep ivermectin and <b>closantel</b> were 78 % and 7 1 % effective respectively. [n goats, albendazole was 78 % and ivermectin was 76 % effective. A significant reduction (P 0. 05) except with few drugs. The occurrence of anthelmintic resistance in the small holder sheep and goat farming sector is a cause of concern. Steps should therefore be taken by policy makers to prevent its further spread and to avoid the development of a situation as on commercial sheep farms where resistance is rampant. Master...|$|E
40|$|A atuação dos anti-helmínticos à base de {{ivermectin}} (0, 2 mg/kg), levamisole (10 mg/kg), <b>closantel</b> (10 mg/kg) e albendazole (10 mg/kg), foi avaliada em 65 rebanhos ovinos do estado de Santa Catarina, Brasil. As avaliações foram executadas quando o rebanho apresentava-se com o lote controle acima de 500 ovos por grama de fezes (OPG) da ordem Strongylida, acompanhado do cultivo de larvas. Foram aleatoriamente formados quatro grupos de 10 animais, identificados e tratados com os respectivos anti-helmínticos. Sete a 10 dias após, foram coletadas amostras de fezes dos animais de cada grupo para a verificação do OPG e identificação das larvas e os resultados comparados com o do lote controle. Considerou-se resistência quando a eficácia da droga foi menor do que 95 % e o intervalo de confiança, menor do que 90 %. Dos 65 rebanhos avaliados, a resistência ao ivermectin esteve presente em 77 %, sendo somente identificadas larvas de Haemonchus (100 %), ao albendazole em 65 %, sendo Haemonchus (74 %), Ostertagia (15 %) e Trichostrongylus (11 %), ao <b>closantel</b> em 13 %, sendo Haemonchus (100 %) e em 15 % ao levamisole sendo Trichostrongylus (44 %), Ostertagia (39 %) e Haemonchus (17 %). Conclui-se que a multi-resistência está presente na maioria do rebanho ovino catarinense. Sixty-five sheep flocks {{were studied}} in Santa Catarina State to determine parasites resistance to anthelmintics based on ivermectin (0. 2 mg/kg), levamisole (10 mg/kg), <b>closantel</b> (10 mg/kg) and albendazole (10 mg/kg). The evaluation was carryed out when a particular sheep flock showed {{a control group}} with EPG (eggs per gram) level above 500. Larvae culture was also performed to allow the parasite identification. Four randomized groups of 10 animals were formed and treated {{with one of the}} four anthelmintic products. Faecal samples were collected of each group seven to ten days after the treatment, aiming to perform the eggs count and larvae identification. These results were compared with results of the control group. The anthelmintics were considered to present evidence of parasite resistance when the efficacy of the product was lower than 95 %. From the total of 65 sheep flock studied, seventy-seven percent presented parasite resistance to ivermectin, with Haemonchus larvae only (100 %); sixty-five percent to albendazole, with Haemonchus (74 %), Ostertagia (15 %) and Trichostrongylus (11 %); thirteen percent to <b>closantel,</b> with Haemonchus (100 %); and fifteen percent to levamisole, with Thichostrongylus (44 %), Ostertagia (39 %) and Haemonchus (17 %).
