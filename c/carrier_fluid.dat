50|$|MR fluid is {{different}} from a ferrofluid which has smaller particles. MR fluid particles are primarily on the micrometre-scale and are too dense for Brownian motion to keep them suspended (in the lower density <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid).</b> Ferrofluid particles are primarily nanoparticles that are suspended by Brownian motion and generally will not settle under normal conditions. As a result, these two fluids have very different applications.|$|E
50|$|Because {{powder coating}} {{does not have}} a liquid carrier, it can produce thicker {{coatings}} than conventional liquid coatings without running or sagging, and powder coating produces minimal appearance differences between horizontally coated surfaces and vertically coated surfaces. Because no <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> evaporates away, the coating process emits few volatile organic compounds (VOC). Finally, several powder colors can be applied before curing them all together, allowing color blending and bleed special effects in a single layer.|$|E

A series of the polysiloxane triblock copolymers with systematically varied molecular weights were prepared via anionic polymerization using LiOH as an initiator. These copolymers formed micelles in toluene or poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) <b>carrier</b> <b>fluids</b> and served as “nanoreactors ” for thermal decomposition of the Co 2 (CO) 8 precursor. The nitrile groups on the PCPMS central blocks are thought to coordinate onto the particle surface, while the PDMS endblocks protrude into the reaction medium to provide steric stability. The particle size can be controlled by adjusting the cobalt to copolymer ratio. Ordered self-assemblies of these cobalt nanoparticles are observed when the dispersions are cast from toluene. Electron diffraction spectroscopy reveals that the cobalt nanoparticles have fcc crystal structures. TEM shows non-aggregated cobalt nanoparticles with narrow size distributions, which are evenly surrounded with copolymer sheaths.

While vehicle applications are the most common use of MR dampers, useful medical applications have risen as well, including implants and rehabilitation methods. Since MR dampers and not yet perfect, they are limited in terms of application. Disadvantages do exist when using a large scale MR damper, for example, particle settling within the <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> may occur that inhibits some possible application.|$|E

Overall, the electrode materials and <b>carrier</b> <b>fluids</b> have to be specifically matched to avoid excessive electrode corrosion or oxidation (and contamination of materials to be treated), while maintaining ample power and function.|$|R

This is similar to the way that the ions in an aqueous paramagnetic salt solution (such as an aqueous solution of copper(II) sulfate or manganese(II) chloride) make the solution paramagnetic. The composition of a typical ferrofluid is about 5% magnetic solids, 10% surfactant and 85% carrier, by volume.|$|E

50|$|A magnetorheological fluid (MR fluid, or MRF) {{is a type}} {{of smart}} fluid in a <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid,</b> usually a type of oil. When {{subjected}} to a magnetic field, the fluid greatly increases its apparent viscosity, to the point of becoming a viscoelastic solid. Importantly, the yield stress of the fluid when in its active ("on") state can be controlled very accurately by varying the magnetic field intensity. The upshot is that the fluid's ability to transmit force can be controlled with an electromagnet, which gives rise to its many possible control-based applications. Extensive discussions of the physics and applications of MR fluids {{can be found in a}} recent book.|$|E

Both these fluids show the unique behavior of behaving like a liquid under low or normal pressure and solid under high pressure or applied fields. The shear thickening fluid is made with polyethylene glycol and the solid part is made of nano-particles of silica. This liquid is soaked into all the layers of a Kevlar vest.The magnetorheological fluid consists of magnetic (typically iron) particles in a <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> such as oil.

5000|$|Ferrofluids are {{colloidal}} liquids made of nanoscale ferromagnetic, or ferrimagnetic, particles {{suspended in}} a <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> (usually an organic solvent or water). Each tiny particle is thoroughly {{coated with a}} surfactant to inhibit clumping. Large ferromagnetic particles can be ripped out of the homogeneous colloidal mixture, forming a separate clump of magnetic dust when exposed to strong magnetic fields. The magnetic attraction of nanoparticles is weak enough that the surfactant's Van der Waals force is sufficient to prevent magnetic clumping or agglomeration. Ferrofluids usually do not retain magnetization {{in the absence of}} an externally applied field and thus are often classified as [...] "superparamagnets" [...] rather than ferromagnets.|$|E

50|$|The {{suspension}} {{of a large}} amount of small scale solid particles in a gas results in a large surface-area-to-volume ratio. Studies in the scientific literature have shown that there is a unique interaction between the properties of solid nanoparticles and those of <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid.</b> The end result, which is not observed with larger scale particles (i.e. micron), is the alteration of the properties of the bulk fluid. For example, Lee et al. (1999) and Wang et al.

50|$|Tracers {{are used}} in the oil {{industry}} in order to qualitatively or quantitatively gauge how fluid flows through the reservoir, as well as being a useful tool for estimating residual oil saturation. Tracers can be used in either interwell tests or single well tests. In interwell tests, the tracer is injected at one well along with the <b>carrier</b> <b>fluid</b> (water in a waterflood or gas in a gasflood) and detected at a producing well after some period of time, which can be anything from days to years. In single well tests, tracer is injected into the formation from a well and then produced out the same well. The delay between a tracer that does not react with the formation (a conservative tracer) and one that does (a partitioning tracer) will give an indication of residual oil saturation, a piece of information that is difficult to acquire by other means.|$|E

Extremis rewrites the repair center. In the first stage, the body essentially becomes an open wound. The normal human blueprint is being replaced with the Extremis blueprint. The brain is being told the body is wrong. Extremis protocol dictates that the subject be placed on life support and intravenously fed nutrients at this point.

One of their major drawbacks is that the heavy use of surfactants to achieve mixture stability leads to hysteresis phenomena in the thermal performance of these fluids. An additional issue-this time to be foreseen from the literature review analysis on nanofluids-is that the stability of the nanoemulsion {{is probably going to be}} endangered in high temperature heat transfer as the conventional surfactant chemical composition at those temperatures changes irreversibly (surfactants are destroyed).|$|R
