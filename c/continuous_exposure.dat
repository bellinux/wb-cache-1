40|$|Abstract Background In {{epidemiological}} studies explanatory variables are frequently subject to measurement error. The {{aim of this}} paper is to develop a Bayesian method to correct for measurement error in multiple <b>continuous</b> <b>exposures</b> in individually matched case-control studies. This is a topic that has not been widely investigated. The new method is illustrated using data from an individually matched case-control study of the association between thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy and exposure to perfluorinated acids. The objective of the motivating study was to examine the risk of maternal hypothyroxinemia due to exposure to three perfluorinated acids measured on a continuous scale. Results from the proposed method are compared with those obtained from a naive analysis. Methods Using a Bayesian approach, the developed method considers a classical measurement error model for the exposures, as well as the conditional logistic regression likelihood as the disease model, together with a random-effect exposure model. Proper and diffuse prior distributions are assigned, and results from a quality control experiment are used to estimate the perfluorinated acids' measurement error variability. As a result, posterior distributions and 95 % credible intervals of the odds ratios are computed. A sensitivity analysis of method's performance in this particular application with different measurement error variability was performed. Results The proposed Bayesian method to correct for measurement error is feasible and can be implemented using statistical software. For the study on perfluorinated acids, a comparison of the inferences which are corrected for measurement error to those which ignore it indicates that little adjustment is manifested for the level of measurement error actually exhibited in the exposures. Nevertheless, a sensitivity analysis shows that more substantial adjustments arise if larger measurement errors are assumed. Conclusions In individually matched case-control studies, the use of conditional logistic regression likelihood as a disease model in the presence of measurement error in multiple <b>continuous</b> <b>exposures</b> can be justified by having a random-effect exposure model. The proposed method can be successfully implemented in WinBUGS to correct individually matched case-control studies for several mismeasured <b>continuous</b> <b>exposures</b> under a classical measurement error model. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{motivated}} by data from the Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration (ERFC), a large individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of risk factors for coronary heart disease(CHD). Cardiovascular disease is the largest {{cause of death in}} almost all countries in the world, therefore {{it is important to be}} able to characterise the shape of risk factor–CHD relationships. Many of the risk factors for CHD considered by the ERFC are subject to substantial measurement error, and their relationship with CHD non-linear. We firstly consider issues associated with modelling the risk factor–disease relationship in a single study, before using meta-analysis to combine relationships across studies. It is well known that classical measurement error generally attenuates linear exposure–disease relationships, however its precise effect on non-linear relationships is less well understood. We investigate the effect of classical measurement error on the shape of exposure–disease relationships that are commonly encountered in epidemiological studies, and then consider methods for correcting for classical measurement error. We propose the application of a widely used correction method, regression calibration, to fractional polynomial models. We also consider the effects of non-classical error on the observed exposure–disease relationship, and the impact on our correction methods when we erroneously assume classical measurement error. Analyses performed using categorised <b>continuous</b> <b>exposures</b> are common in epidemiology. We show that MacMahon’s method for correcting for measurement error in analyses that use categorised <b>continuous</b> <b>exposures,</b> although simple, does not provide the correct shape for nonlinear exposure–disease relationships. We perform a simulation study to compare alternative methods for categorised <b>continuous</b> <b>exposures.</b> Meta-analysis is the statistical synthesis of results from a number of studies addressing similar research hypotheses. The use of IPD is the gold standard approach because it allows for consistent analysis of the exposure–disease relationship across studies. Methods have recently been proposed for combining non-linear relationships across studies. We discuss these methods, extend them to P-spline models, and consider alternative methods of combining relationships across studies. We apply the methods developed to the relationships of fasting blood glucose and lipoprotein(a) with CHD, using data from the ERFC. This work was supported by the Medical Research Counci...|$|R

40|$|Background Epidemiologists {{are often}} {{interested}} in examining different hypotheses for how exposures measured repeatedly over the lifecourse relate to later-life outcomes. A structured approach for selecting the hypotheses most supported by theory and observed data {{has been developed}} for binary exposures. The aim {{of this paper is}} to extend this to include <b>continuous</b> <b>exposures</b> and allow for confounding and missing data. Methods We studied two examples: the association between (i) maternal weight during pregnancy and birthweight, and (ii) stressful family events throughout childhood and depression in adolescence. In each example we considered several plausible hypotheses including accumulation, critical periods, sensitive periods, change, and effect modification. We used least angle regression to select the hypothesis that explained most variation in the outcome, demonstrating appropriate methods for adjusting for confounders and dealing with missing data. Results The structured approach identified a combination of sensitive periods: pre-pregnancy weight, and gestational weight gain 0 - 20 weeks and 20 - 40 weeks, as the best explanation for variation in birthweight after adjusting for maternal height. A sensitive period hypothesis best explained variation in adolescent depression, with the association strengthening with the proximity of stressful family events. For each example, these models have theoretical support at least as strong as any competing hypothesis. Conclusions We have extended the structured approach to incorporate <b>continuous</b> <b>exposures,</b> confounding and missing data. This approach can be used in either an exploratory or confirmatory setting. The interpretation, plausibility, and consistence with causal assumptions, should all be considered when proposing and choosing lifecourse hypotheses...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} this one year {{research}} grant was to extend the two stage clonal expansion model (TSCE) of carcinogenesis to exposures other than the usual single acute exposure. The two-stage clonal expansion model of carcinogenesis incorporates the biological process of carcinogenesis, which involves two mutations and the clonal proliferation of the intermediate cells, in a stochastic, mathematical way. The current TSCE model serves a general purpose of acute exposure models but requires numerical computation of both the survival and hazard functions. The primary objective of this research project was to develop the analytical expressions for the survival function and the hazard function of the occurrence of the first cancer cell for acute, <b>continuous</b> and multiple <b>exposure</b> cases {{within the framework of}} the piece-wise constant parameter two-stage clonal expansion model of carcinogenesis. For acute exposure and multiple exposures of acute series, it is either only allowed to have the first mutation rate vary with the dose, or to have all the parameters be dose dependent; for multiple <b>exposures</b> of <b>continuous</b> <b>exposures,</b> all the parameters are allowed to vary with the dose. With these analytical functions, it becomes easy to evaluate the risks of cancer and allows one to deal with the various exposure patterns in cancer risk assessment. A second objective was to apply the TSCE model with varing <b>continuous</b> <b>exposures</b> from the cancer studies of inhaled plutonium in beagle dogs. Using step functions to estimate the retention functions of the pulmonary exposure of plutonium the multiple exposure versions of the TSCE model was to be used to estimate the beagle dog lung cancer risks.

40|$|Neonicotinoids {{have been}} pointed to {{as a factor}} {{responsible}} for the increased honey bee colony losses in the last decades. Many studies have investigated {{the effects of the}} first marketed neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, while fewer have focused on thiamethoxam. One recent study showed that sublethal doses of thiamethoxam lead to colony failure by decreasing forager homing flight success. We thus decided to investigate the mechanism which caused this phenomenon. Our hypothesis was that this effect was caused by impairment of forager locomotion abilities. Therefore we tested the effects of sublethal acute and chronic exposures to thiamethoxam on forager walking (Chapter 2) and flight (Chapter 3) performances. The acute treatment (1. 34 ng/bee) affected walking locomotion firstly triggering hyperactivity (30 min post-treatment) and then impairing motor functioning (60 min post-treatment). 2 -day <b>continuous</b> <b>exposures</b> to thiamethoxam (32. 5, 45 ppb) elicited fewer effects on walking locomotion, however both exposure modes elicited an increased positive phototaxis. Similarly, in flight experiments, the single dose (1. 34 ng/bee) elicited hyperactivity shortly after intoxication (increased flight duration and distance), while longer and <b>continuous</b> <b>exposures</b> (32. 5, 45 ppb) impaired forager motor functions (decreased flight duration, distance, velocity). It is known that flight muscles temperature needs to be precisely regulated by bees during flight. Therefore, we further hypothesized that the impaired flight performances of neonicotinoid intoxicated bees were caused also by thermoregulation anomalies. We tested the effects that acute thiamethoxam exposures (0. 2, 1, 2 ng/bee) elicit on forager thorax temperature (Chapter 4). Foragers treated with high doses exhibited hyperthermia or hypothermia when respectively exposed to high or low environmental temperatures. In summary, we show that sublethal doses of thiamethoxam affected forager walking and flight locomotion, phototaxis and thermoregulation. We also display the intricate mode of action of thiamethoxam which triggered, at different extents, inverse sublethal effects in relation to time and dose...|$|R
