In {{the present}} paper, the {{relationship}} between <b>characteristic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> and compositions was mainly investigated {{in order to find}} a suitable theoretical model for predicting the impedance value of Ti-Mo system composites and FGM. At first, dense Ti-Mo composites with different weight fractions of Mo were prepared. Then the transverse and longitudinal wave velocities of the samples were measured and the <b>characteristic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> values were obtained. A mixture model was adopted to estimate the <b>characteristic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> value of Ti-Mo composites. Comparisons between the estimated and experimental results demonstrated that the suggested model was sufficiently accurate to predict the <b>characteristic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> value of Ti-Mo system composites and FGM...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the {{dissertation}} we provide electrical circuit descriptions for bulk plasmons, single-surface plasmons, and parallel-plate plasmons. Simple circuits can reproduce the exact frequency versus wave-vector dispersion relations for all these cases, with reasonable accuracy. The circuit paradigm directly provides a <b>characteristic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> that is rarely discussed in the context of plasmonics. Owing to the presence of kinetic inductance, a plasmonic transmission line can support very large characteristic impedances on the order of kilo-Ohms. The ability to adjust the plasmonic wave impedance allows voltage transformer action at optical frequencies, through tapered metallic structures. This transformer action can be used to engineer efficientdelivery of optical power to the nanoscale, or as an impedance matching tool toward molecular light emitters. In the second part of the dissertation we discuss at length the application of plasmonic impedance matching to the problem of heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) where an optical antenna is used to concentrate optical power to nanoscale dimensions on the surface of amagnetic hard-disk drive...|$|E
40|$|Analyses of the {{resonances}} of both symmetric and antisymmetric polarization {{states in}} pairs of tightly coupled nanoshells, made of either a gold-core/dielectric-shell or a dielectric-core/gold-shell, {{are carried out}} at optical frequencies. The nanoparticles are modeled as single electric dipoles, at first considering only the static (non retarded) field terms and resorting to closed-form expressions to investigate the transverse and longitudinal (with respect to the pair axis) plasmonic resonance frequencies of the nanoshell pair. These approximate resonance values are then compared to the ones obtained including all dynamical retarded field terms, and with full wave simulations. We also show how the additional degree of freedom provided by using nanoshells, in contrast to using solid metallic nanoparticles, can be exploited for tuning the symmetric and antisymmetric resonance frequencies in pairs of tightly coupled nanoshells. Indeed, optical resonances of nanoshells can be varied over hundreds of nanometers in wavelength, across the visible and into the infrared region of the spectrum, by varying the relative dimensions of the core and shell. This makes the pair suitable as a constituent for metamaterials since it supports an antisymmetric mode that {{can be interpreted as}} an effective magnetic dipole; therefore, it is useful for providing artificial magnetism in metamaterials that may support backward propagation or have equivalent high/low <b>characteristic</b> <b>wave</b> <b>impedance.</b> Furthermore, we show the field enhancement between the two nanoparticles which may find applications in surface enhanced Raman scattering. We also show how an incident field excites the transversal and longitudinal modes supported by the pair. © 2010 SPIE...|$|E

30|$|By Eq. (1), the <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> {{decreases}} as the {{distributed capacitance}} increases, and increases as the distributed reactance increases. Usually the <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> of overhead lines is between 270 and 380  Ω [14]. The mutual inductance {{approaches to the}} self-reactance when the cable cores are arranged closely. The equivalent distributed reactance is greatly reduced when the values of currents in two cores are the same with opposite directions. At the same time, when {{the distance between the}} cable cores is closer and the insulation material between the cores has a relative dielectric constant up to 4 or 5, the distributed capacitance is greatly increased. So the cable’s <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> would be much less than overhead line’s <b>impedance.</b> The cable’s <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> would be approximately 1 / 7 of overhead line’s impedance [15]. From Eq. (2), {{it can be seen that}} the transmission capability of a cable is approximately 7 times those of overhead lines or catenaries at the same voltage level, since the natural power is inversely proportional to the <b>wave</b> <b>impedance.</b> Empirical data [14] show that the output power at one side of a single loop (head-to-end) of 35  kV overhead lines can reach up to 10  MW with a transmission distance of approximately 20  km, while the output power of cables under the same condition can reach up to 70  MW (for double-loop circuit lines to 140  MW). Thus it can be derived that the cable’s one-side transmission distance is up to 100  km or longer. It is able to fully meet the needs of any metro or light rail line.|$|R

40|$|When a task must be {{executed}} {{in a remote}} or dangerous environment, teleoperation systems may be employed to extend {{the influence of the}} human operator. In the case of manipulation tasks, haptic feedback of the forces experienced by the remote (slave) system is often highly useful in improving an operator's ability to perform effectively. In many of these cases (especially teleoperation over the internet and ground-to-space teleoperation), substantial communication latency exists in the control loop and has the strong tendency to cause instability of the system. The first viable solution to this problem in the literature was based on a scattering/wave transformation from transmission line theory. This wave transformation requires the designer to select a <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> parameter appropriate to the teleoperation system. It is widely recognized that a small value of <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> is well suited to free motion and a large value is preferable for contact tasks. Beyond this basic observation, however, very little guidance exists in the literature regarding the selection of an appropriate value. Moreover, prior research on impedance selection generally fails to account for the fact that in any realistic contact task there will simultaneously exist contact considerations (perpendicular to the surface of contact) and quasi-free-motion considerations (parallel to the surface of contact). The primary contribution of the present work is to introduce an approximate linearized optimum for the choice of <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> and to apply this quasi-optimal choice to the Cartesian reality of such a contact task, in which it cannot be expected that a given joint will be either perfectly normal to or perfectly parallel to the motion constraint. The proposed scheme selects a <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> matrix that is appropriate to the conditions encountered by the manipulator. This choice may be implemented as a static <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> value or as a time-varying choice updated according to the instantaneous conditions encountered. A Lyapunov-like analysis is presented demonstrating that time variation in <b>wave</b> <b>impedance</b> will not violate the passivity of the system. Experimental trials, both in simulation and on a haptic feedback device, are presented validating the technique. Consideration is also given to the case of an uncertain environment, in which an a priori impedance choice may not be possible...|$|R
