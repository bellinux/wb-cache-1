5|$|Factors {{affecting}} one's {{ability to}} delay gratification {{depend on whether}} the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at {{the will of the}} person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Led Zeppelin's next album, Houses of the Holy, was {{released}} in March 1973. It featured further experimentation by the band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and mellotron orchestration. The predominantly orange album cover, designed by the London-based design group Hipgnosis, depicts images of nude children climbing the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Although the <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> shown from the front, the cover was controversial {{at the time of}} the album's release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the sleeve.|$|E
5|$|The husband, whose stained hands reveal he is a dyer by trade, looks harried as {{he carries}} his {{exhausted}} youngest daughter. In earlier impressions (and the painting), {{his hands are}} blue, to show his occupation, while his wife's face is coloured with red ink. The placement of the cow's horns behind his head represents him as a cuckold and suggests the <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> his. Behind the couple, their children replay the scene: the father's cane protrudes between the son's legs, doubling as a hobby horse, while the daughter is clearly in charge, demanding that he hand over his gingerbread. A limited number of proofs missing the girl and artist's signature were printed; Hogarth added the mocking girl to explain the boy's tears.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, {{women are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Supplies of {{raw cotton}} from the United States were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–65, {{leading to the}} {{formation}} of the Royton Local Board of Health in 1863, whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality. On 26 November 1884 an explosive device containing gunpowder was detonated in Royton Town Hall, in a cellar underneath the offices of Royton's local board. An anonymous communication was received by the supposed bomber, stating that he intended the explosion for the Royton School Board because <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> allowed to work at the age of 10 years, and because he wanted the abolition of the Factory Acts. There were no fatalities caused by the explosion, and damage to the building was restricted to smoke damage and shattered windows, doors and woodwork. The Great Depression, and First and Second World Wars each contributed to periods of economic decline in Royton. However, in as late the 1950s, 80% of Royton's population was employed in the textile mills. As imports of cheaper foreign yarns increased during the mid-20th century, Royton's textile sector declined gradually to a halt; cotton spinning reduced in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the early 1980s only four mills were operational. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton was spun in the town in 1998. Less than a dozen mills are still standing in Royton, the majority of which are now used for light engineering or as distribution centres.|$|E

25|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{scholars}} have noted {{a shift in}} the demographics of migrant workers. Particularly in Asian countries, but also in Latin American countries, a growing number of women are traveling abroad for jobs as domestic and service workers. In many of these cases, women take on jobs caring for the children of families in wealthier nations, while leaving their own children in the country of origin. This can mean that their own <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> well-cared for and may suffer as a result.|$|E
