40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of neonatal and young calves persistently infected (PI) with Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) by antigen-capture {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ACE) may be complicated by interference from colostrum-derived specific antibodies. Ten calves, with 3 calves identified as PI and 7 as non-PI {{were used in the}} current study. All non-PI calves were shown to be seropositive for BVDV-specific antibodies by antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ab-ELISA) on serum. Serum samples, ear notch samples, and nasal and saliva swabs were collected from each calf from birth until 12 weeks of age and tested by ELISA for BVDV-specific antigen and antibodies. Following colostrum ingestion, Ab-ELISA sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios rose by a mean of 0. 95 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 64 - 1. 25) and 1. 72 (95 % CI = 1. 55 - 1. 89) in seropositive, non-PI calves and in PI calves, respectively. The mean S/P ratios then declined to approximately 1. 1 in non-PI calves and 0. 5 in PI calves at between 60 and 80 days of age. In PI calves, testing for antigen in serum and nasal and saliva swabs was subject to interference by colostrum-derived antibodies in calves up to 3 weeks of age. Nasal swabs were less affected than serum and saliva swabs.

40|$|The recent {{characterization}} of the mitochondrial protein, Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory (StAR) protein, as a rate-limiting protein in steroidogenesis prompted us to investigate whether StAR is expressed in the rabbit corpus luteum and whether the expression of StAR is responsive to estradiol- 1 71, the luteotropic hormone in the rabbit. In rabbits treated continuously with ex-ogenous estradiol through Day 13 of pseudopregnancy (n = 9), immunoblot analysis revealed that luteal expression of StAR was stable, ranging from 8. 5 to 9. 7 U of <b>corrected</b> integrated <b>optical</b> <b>density.</b> Plasma progesterone concentration (mean SEM) re-mained elevated in these rabbits (14. 3 ± 2. 1 ng/ml). In contrast, expression of StAR decreased in corpora lutea of rabbits de-prived of estradiol for the last 48 and 72 h of the experiment (4. 9 ± 2. 2 and 0. 3 ± 0. 2 U, respectively, n = 3 per group), and {{was associated with a}} decline in plasma progesterone (0. 8 ± 0. 1 and 0. 5 0. 3 ng/ml, respectively). Replacement of estradiol after 48 h of estradiol deprivation (n = 3) stimulated the reap-pearance of StAR (10. 3 ± 2. 6 U) and the restoration of plasma progesterone (10. 4 4. 9 ng/ml). [35 S]Methionine labeling of proteins in rabbit corpora lutea revealed that several isoforms of StAR protein were specifically synthesized in response to es-tradiol treatment.

Methods: MP <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (measured psychophysically using heterochromatic flicker photometry [HFP]), and serum concentrations of L and Z (quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]), were recorded every month for 24 consecutive months. Results: Mean MP <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> (SD) was 0. 361 (0. 086) and 0. 369 (0. 074) for right and left eyes, respectively. There was no statistically significant seasonal variation in MP <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> for the group (two-way ANOVA: p > 0. 05).

We identified articles that reported on supplementation with lutein and/or zeaxanthin and/or meso-zeaxanthin on macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> measurement techniques published in peer-reviewed journals, through a multi-staged, systematic approach. Twenty-four studies have investigated the repeatability of MPOD measurements using heterochromatic flicker photometry. Of these, 10 studies provided a coefficient of repeatability or data from which the coefficient could be calculated, with a range in values of 0. 06 to 0. 58. The lowest coefficient of repeatability assessed on naïve subjects alone was 0. 08. These values tell us that, at best, changes greater than 0. 08 can be considered clinically significant and at worst, only changes greater than 0. 58 can be considered clinically significant. Six studies assessed the effect of supplementation with up to 20 mg/day lutein on macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> measured using heterochromatic flicker photometry and the mean increase in macular pigment <b>optical</b> <b>density</b> ranged from 0. 025 to 0. 09.
