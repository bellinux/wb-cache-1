There are very few studies on arginase activity, NO level and oxidative stress status in mycoplasmal infections. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate erythrocyte arginase activity, plasma NO level and oxidative stress status in sheep with <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia.</b> The study material consisted of 10 healthy sheep and 14 sheep with <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia</b> characterised by mastitis, arthritis and keratoconjunctivitis.

40|$|Mycoplasma agalactiae {{is one of}} {{the causal}} agents of {{classical}} <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia</b> (CA), a serious, economically important but neglected enzootic disease of small ruminants. It occurs {{in many parts of the}} world and most notably in the Mediterranean Basin. Following the infection common complications are septicaemia, mastitis, arthritis, pleurisy, pneumonia, and keratoconjunctivitis. Primary or tentative diagnosis of the organism is based upon clinical signs. Various serological tests, namely, growth precipitation, immunofluorescence, complement fixation test, haemagglutination inhibition, agglutination, immunodiffusion, enzyme immunoassays, immunoelectrophoresis, blotting techniques, and others, are available. Molecular tools seem to be much more sensitive, specific, and faster and help to differentiate various strains. The real-time PCR, multiplex PCR, quantitative PCR, PCR-RFLP, MLST, and gene probes, complementary to segments of chromosomal DNA or 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), have strengthened the diagnosis of M. agalactiae.

40|$|<b>Contagious</b> <b>agalactia</b> is a mycoplasmal {{infection}} {{caused by}} Mycoplasma agalactiae, Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides LC, M. mycoides subsp. capri, Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum and Mycoplasma putrefaciens. Identification of the causative organisms is usually performed by isolation and classical biochemical and serological tests, {{though this is}} a lengthy and cumbersome process for mycoplasmas. Specific PCR assays {{have been developed for}} the identification of Mycoplasma agalactiae and M. putrefaciens. For members of the M. mycoides cluster existing PCR tests are based on the amplification of highly conserved genes coding for ribosomal proteins, hence a possibility of cross-reactions. The gene glk, coding for a glucokinase, that is found in this cluster is very distantly related to any other bacterial glucokinase described so far. It was therefore chosen as target to design a new PCR test. The validation was performed independently in three laboratories in France and India using over 100 mycoplasma strains of various geographical origins. All strains belonging to the M. mycoides cluster were detected by amplification of the expected PCR product (428 bp) while no amplification was obtained from M. agalactiae strains. Our results demonstrate the universality of this PCR in spite of the great heterogeneity found within this cluster.

40|$|Abstract Background Ruminant mycoplasmoses are {{important}} diseases worldwide and several are listed by the World Organization for Animal Health {{to be of}} major economic significance. In France the distribution of mycoplasmal species isolated from clinical samples collected from diseased animals upon veterinary request, is monitored by a network known as VIGIMYC (for VIGIlance to MYCoplasmoses of ruminants). The veterinary diagnostic laboratories collaborating with VIGIMYC are responsible for isolating the mycoplasmas while identification of the isolates is centralized by the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA) in Lyon. The VIGIMYC framework {{can also be used}} for specific surveys and one example, on the prevalence of M. bovis in bovine respiratory diseases, is presented here. Results Between 2003 and 2008, 34 laboratories were involved in the network and 1904 mycoplasma isolates, originating from the main ruminant-breeding areas, were identified. For cattle, the high prevalence of M. bovis in bronchopneumonia, notably in young animals, was confirmed by VIGIMYC and an associated specific survey, whereas the non-emergence of species such as M. alkalescens and M. canis was also demonstrated. The etiological agent of bovine contagious pleuropneumonia was never isolated. The principal mycoplasmosis in goats was <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia</b> with M. mycoides subsp. capri as main agent. Ovine mycoplasmoses, most of which were associated with pneumonia in lambs, were infrequently reported. One exception was ovine <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia</b> (due to M. agalactiae) that has recently re-emerged in the Pyrénées where it had been endemic for years and was also reported in Corsica, which was previously considered free. Conclusions Although VIGIMYC is a passive network and somewhat biased as regards sample collection and processing, it has provided, in this study, an overview of the main mycoplasmoses of ruminants in France.

In the Italian accident, the vaccine was a formol-inactivated immunogen against <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia</b> pre-pared by a single manufacturer (Rome, Italy) from the brain and mammary gland homogenates of sheep experi-mentally infected with Mycoplasma agalactiae [14, 16].

40|$|A {{multiplex}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (m-PCR) assay was optimized for the simultaneous detection of several species of small ruminant mycoplasmas. Two sets of oligonucleotide primers specific for Mycoplasma agalactiae (Ma) and Mycoplasma "mycoides" cluster (M. m. cluster) {{were used in the}} test. The m-PCR was able to amplify a 375 -bp fragment of Ma chromosomal DNA and a 257 - 260 -bp fragment of M. m. cluster chromosomal DNA. Four reference strains (M. agalactiae, M. mycoides subsp. mycoides LC, M. capricolum subsp. capricolum, M. mycoides subsp. capri) and 56 samples (44 milk samples, two nasal swabs, six ocular swabs, three vaginal swabs and one sample of fibrinous exudate from carpal joint), from sheep and goats with clinical signs of <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia</b> (CA), were examined. The m-PCR confirmed the identification of reference strains and allowed to identify, of the 43 positive samples examined, 35 Ma strains, 12 M. "mycoides" cluster strains; in four samples both Ma and mycoplasmas of M. "mycoides" cluster were revealed. The m-PCR was able to detect 1 pg of mycoplasma DNA. The specificity and sensitivity of the m-PCR suggest its use for the "routine" diagnosis of CA...|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma agalactiae is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia,</b> a serious disease of small ruminants characterized by mastitis, polyarthritis, keratoconjunctivitis, and abortion. Mycoplasmas totally lack the cell wall, so membrane proteins are directly exposed to environment. To date, {{a limited number}} of M. agalactiae antigens have been described. The combination of 2 -D PAGE and mass spectrometry is a well-established method for proteome studies; however, it is reported that standard 2 -D PAGE lacks in resolution of hydrophobic and basic proteins, which are abundant in mycoplasmas membrane. Indeed, membrane proteins are poorly represented in total extracts maps. In this study, the membrane proteome of M. agalactiae PG 2 T was characterized. The Triton X- 114 fractionation allowed the enrichment for M. agalactiae PG 2 T membrane proteins. Liposoluble proteins were subjected to 2 -D PAGE-MS, leading to the identification of 40 unique proteins. The differential expression of liposoluble proteins, among PG 2 T strain and two field isolates, was revealed by 2 D DIGE. The use of GeLC-MS/MS allowed to increase the coverage of the liposoluble proteome. A total of 194 unique proteins were identified, (26...|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum {{is one of}} the causative {{agents of}} <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia</b> (CA). Nevertheless, there is still a lack of {{information}} about its antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic characteristics. Therefore, the aim of this work was to study the antimicrobial and genetic variability of different Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum field isolates. For this purpose, the growth inhibition effect of 18 antimicrobials and a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on five housekeeping genes (fusA, glpQ, gyrB, lepA and rpoB) were performed on 32 selected field isolates from Italy and Spain. The results showed a wide range of growth inhibitory effects for almost all the antimicrobials studied. Macrolides presented lower efficacy inhibiting Mcc growth than in previous works performed on other CA-causative mycoplasmas. Erythromycin was not able to inhibit the growth of any of the studied strains, contrary to doxycycline, which inhibited the growth of all of them from low concentrations. On the other hand, the study of the concatenated genes revealed a high genetic variability among the different Mcc isolates. Hence, these genetic variations were greater than the ones reported in prior works on other mycoplasma species...|$|E
40|$|As a {{first step}} toward the design of an epitope vaccine to prevent <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia,</b> the {{strongly}} immunogenic 55 -kDa protein of Mycoplasma agalactiae was studied and found to correspond to the AvgC protein encoded by the avgC gene. The avg genes of M. agalactiae, which encode four variable surface lipoproteins, display a significant homology to the vsp (variable membrane surface lipoproteins) genes of the bovine pathogen Mycoplasma bovis at their promoter region as well as their N-terminus-encoding regions. Some members of the Vsp family are known to be involved in cytoadhesion to host cells. In order to localize immunogenic peptides in the AvgC antigen, the protein sequence was submitted to epitope prediction analysis, and five sets of overlapping peptides, corresponding to five selected regions, were synthesized by Spot synthesis. Reactive peptides were selected by immunobinding assay with sera from infected sheep. The three most immunogenic epitopes were shown to be surface exposed by immunoprecipitation assays, and one of these was specifically recognized by all tested sera. Our study indicates that selected epitopes of the AvgC lipoprotein may be used to develop a peptide-based vaccine which is effective against M. agalactiae infection...|$|E

Mycoplasma agalactiae and Mycoplasma bovis both {{are responsible for}} respiratory conditions in sheep and goats. M. agalactiae is a major pathogen of sheep and goats and accounts for almost 90 % of outbreaks of <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia</b> syndrome in goats and almost 100 % in sheep. On the basis of clinical signs and cultural, morphological, and biochemical characterization {{it is almost impossible}} to differentiate between both the species. Moreover, due to presence of genomic and proteomic similarity most of the time routine diagnostic tests fail to differentiate between them. Hence the present studywas conducted to find out the protein profile of isolates of both the species by SDS-PAGE and to find out the cross-reacting as well as differentiating immunogenic proteins by Immunoblotting, which can be of immunoprophylactic as well as diagnostic values. The study revealed 6 - 7 major immunogenic cross-reactive proteins with the presence of two important non-cross-reacting species specific polypeptides particularly 25. 50 and 24. 54 kDa inM. agalactiae andM. bovis, respectively, that might be of diagnostic values. 1...|$|E
40|$|In goat {{and sheep}} flocks, {{mycoplasmosis}} {{is a disease}} that may cause severe economical losses associated with polyarthritis, mastitis, agalactia, conjunctivitis, pneumonia and reproductive failure. The latter may involve repeat breeding, granular vulvovaginitis, infertility and abortions. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the occurrence of Mycoplasma agalactiae (Ma) in semen and milk samples from naturally infected goat in the semiarid region from Pernambuco State, Northeast from Brazil. Thirty-nine semen samples and 81 milk samples were submitted to DNA extraction using a commercially available kit and following the manufacturer's instructions. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was then performed in accordance with protocols described in the literature. The results of the present study revealed the presence of Ma in the DNA of 17. 9 % (7 / 39) of the semen samples and 3. 7 % (3 / 81) of the milk samples. The results obtained in the present study confirm the elimination of the DNA of Ma in the semen and milk samples. The presence of this agent in goat flocks is considered very risky in terms of reproductive disorders and <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia</b> outbreaks in the Northeast region of Brazil...|$|E
40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the status of {{infectious}} diseases that are serious for animal health and have adverse economic effects in Mongolia. Data presented here are limited {{due to the lack of}} published or other easily available documents. Foot-and-mouth disease continues to cause substantial economic losses as exemplified by the outbreak of infection with serotype O PanAsia lineage virus. In the case of the 2001 outbreak, a 65 % reduction in export revenues was recorded. In order to ascertain the free status of Mongolia from rinderpest, sero-epidemiological surveillance has been carried out since 2001. In 2004, Mongolia was certified free from rinderpest by Office International des Epizooties（OIE）. A sharp rise in both animal and human brucellosis incidence has become a serious problem. Rabies and anthrax remain endemic with occasional human cases. Other prevailing infectious diseases are contagious pustular dermatitis, <b>contagious</b> <b>agalactia,</b> enterotoxemia and pasteurellosis. The current programs for the control of infectious diseases in livestock in Mongolia lack a definite policy that would enable rapid implementation. A large-scale surveillance of infectious diseases in animals and management of appropriate preventive measures are urgently required in Mongolia...|$|E
40|$|Milk-drop {{syndrome}} of ewes" {{is defined}} as a pathological entity at flock level and a syndrome characterized by reduced milk yield of lactating ewes, with no clinical signs specific to a disease. Concurrent presence of the following two criteria was necessary to diagnose the syndrome in a flock: (i) > 30 % reduction of flock milk production and (ii) > 25 % of ewes affected, each ewe with > 25 % reduction in milk yield. An investigation into the causes of the syndrome was carried out in 22 flocks in Greece. Reduction in milk production in the flocks ranged from 30 % to 90 % and proportion of affected animals ranged from 27 % to 100 %. Subclinical mastitis was the primary cause of the syndrome (11 flocks as sole cause/ 3 flocks co-existing with other disorders). <b>Contagious</b> <b>agalactia</b> was another important cause of the syndrome (3 flocks as sole cause/ 1 flock co-existing with other disorders). Other causes of the syndrome included: inappropriate feeding regime (2 / 4 flocks), small ruminant lentivirus infection (2 / 2 flocks), ruminal acidosis (0 / 3 flocks) and increased burdens of gastrointestinal nematodes (0 / 1 flock).
