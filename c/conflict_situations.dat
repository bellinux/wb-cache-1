40|$|A {{cooperative}} {{strategy for}} solving <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> on mutirobotics motion planning is presented. The strategy is performed with a function with minimal sharing information, which controls that such movements really assists to both robots. We {{show that a}} simple function with cooperative sense can retrieve good paths in <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations.</b> As a rule, finest movements are neccessary to avoid collisions in hard environments such as inside a tunnel. We developed a novel technique inspirated in regularisation and Markovian processes. This technique is currently implemented in a randomized algorithm with a cooperative strategy for solving <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> that often arrive in multi-robot manipulator environments. Randomized Algorithms (RA) have proven their capacity to escape from local minima. On the other hand, if collaborative attitudes are carried-out by {{the participants in the}} task, the time to solve <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> can be considerably reduced. Moreover, when <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> take long time to be solved, high risk of exploring not good free spaces can arrive and hence the search does not often drive directly the robots to their goals. Based on the above considerations, we built a framework of cooperative RA's aiming to facilitate the coordination of robots by establishing commitments to cooperate when <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> appear, and by interacting through the exchange of data to go as directly as possible towards their respective goals. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Context-aware {{systems in}} mobile and {{pervasive}} environments face many <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> while collecting sensor data, processing sensor data to extract consistent and coherent high level context information, and disseminating that context information {{to assist in}} making decisions {{to adapt to the}} continu-ously evolving situations without diverting human attention. These <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> pose stern challenges to the design and development of context-aware systems by making it extremely complicated and error-prone. Quality of Context parameters can be used to cope with these challenges. In this paper, we discuss the <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> that a context-aware system may face at different layers of its conceptual design and present the conflict resolving policies that are defined {{on the basis of the}} Quality of Context parameters. We also illustrate how these policies can be used in different <b>conflicting</b> <b>situations</b> to improve the performance and effectiveness of context-aware systems. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{manner in}} which {{international}} aid was routed through the RRC gave rise to criticism that forever changed {{the way in which}} governments and NGOs respond to international emergencies taking place within <b>conflict</b> <b>situations.</b> International aid supplied to the government and to relief agencies working alongside the government became part of the counter-insurgency strategy of the government. It therefore met real and immediate need, but also prolonged the life of Mengistu's government. The response to the emergency raised disturbing questions about the relationship between humanitarian agencies and host governments.|$|E
25|$|Research {{also shows}} that people high in agreeableness {{are more likely to}} control {{negative}} emotions like anger in <b>conflict</b> <b>situations.</b> Those who are high in agreeableness are more likely to use conflict-avoidant tactics when in conflict with others (whereas people low in agreeableness are more likely to use coercive tactics). They are also more willing to give ground to their adversary and may lose arguments with people who are less agreeable. From their perspective, they have not really lost an argument as much as maintained a congenial relationship with another person.|$|E
40|$|Background, {{participants}} and procedure This research {{is aimed at}} evaluation {{of the role of}} self-assessment and emotions in designation of an aggressive strategy of coping with a social <b>conflict</b> <b>situation</b> by gymnasium school students. It uses a questionnaire to study strategies adopted by youth to cope with a social <b>conflict</b> <b>situation</b> (KSMK), Self-Esteem Scale (SES) and a Three-Factor Personality States and Traits Inventory (TISCO) questionnaire. The empirical study was conducted in gymnasium schools in Wrocław and neighbouring localities. It included 811 adolescents (414 girls and 397 boys) aged 13 - 15. Results and conclusions Based on the analysis of the collected research material, it is concluded that low assessment of teenagers’ own capacity plays a role in choosing an aggressive strategy to cope with a social <b>conflict</b> <b>situation.</b> Participation of adolescents in a situation of a threat to accomplishment of their own objectives intensifies negative emotions. Research results confirm that aggression is a form of dealing with anger and fear felt in a social <b>conflict</b> <b>situation...</b>|$|R

25|$|In December 1918, Stalin {{was sent}} to Perm to lead an inquiry into how the Red Army forces based there had been {{decimated}} in an attack by Alexander Kolchak's White forces. He returned to Moscow between January and March 1919, before being assigned to the Western Front at Petrograd. When the Third Regiment defected, he ordered any captured defectors to be publicly shot. In September he was returned to the Southern Front. During the war, he proved his worth to the Central Committee, displaying decisiveness, determination, {{and a willingness to}} take on responsibility in <b>conflict</b> <b>situations.</b> At the same time, he disregarded orders and when affronted he repeatedly threatened to resign, forcing Lenin to convince him to reconsider. In November 1919, the government awarded him the Order of the Red Banner for his service in the war.|$|E
25|$|Gender roles within social {{hierarchies}} {{are concerned}} with the question of agency in the conduct of physical violence. Men are expected to exert violence, while women are victimized by it. In <b>conflict</b> <b>situations,</b> rape against men dissolves this relationship and puts men in the ‘receiving’ role of the victim. Similarly, the ‘penetrating’ role of men as opposed to the ‘receiving’ role of women in (conventional) sexual intercourse illustrates this constructed power relationship. Hence, male rape victims experience the worst possible ‘humiliation’ with regards to the ingrained social roles they are traditionally expected to fulfill. Moreover, their stigmatization takes on particularly severe dimensions within conservative social environments in which homosexual intercourse – regardless of consent – is punished harshly. For example, Ugandan male rape victims explain their choice to not speak out with the fear of being branded homosexuals. As homosexuality is widely condemned in Uganda, male victims of sexual violence often struggle to get proper support because they are accused of being gay. In certain cases, gender roles concerning violence and sexual conduct are so deeply ingrained that the mere existence of male rape is denied.|$|E

On April 30, 2008, the team signed a three-year deal with WGN Radio (720 AM), with games airing alternately instead on WIND (560 AM) in scheduling <b>conflict</b> <b>situations</b> during the baseball season due to the Cubs having contractual preference to air on WGN; these moved to WGWG-LP (Channel 6/87.7 FM, an analog television station carrying an audio-only sports talk format using a quirk in the FM band) in mid-2014 when Tribune began a local marketing agreement with that station's owner. During the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, the Cubs agreed to allow the Blackhawks games to be broadcast on WGN and have the Cubs revert to WIND when there was a conflict. This allowed the Finals games to be heard over a larger area due to WGN's clear-channel signal. All Blackhawk games are also streamed live on wgnradio.com, regardless of whether the games are on WGN or WGWG-LP. WLUP-FM (97.9 FM) is also utilized as an alternate station.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the sense}} of a natural fit between human {{security}} concepts and humanitarian principles they have enjoyed a difficult relationship. Human security perspectives have the potential to interfere with the traditionally apolitical nature of humanitarianism in <b>conflict</b> <b>situations,</b> leading to a blurring of the boundaries between politico-military interventions and those designed primarily to reduce suffering. In another sense the emphasis on human security has legitimised the idea of armed international intervention as a [...] "moral duty" [...] if states are deemed incapable or unwilling of protecting their citizens. Similarly the adoption of 'holistic' security and development strategies within UN Integrated peacekeeping missions is viewed by some as having the potential to compromise humanitarian principles.|$|E

In several outbreaks, disease and death recorded by facility-based methods underestimated events by a factor of ten or more when compared with population-based estimates.

2500|$|Social {{categorization}} {{theory has}} been discussed as a three-stage process of identification, where [...] "individuals define themselves {{as members of a}} social group, learn the stereotypes and norms of the group, and group categories influence the perception and understanding of all situations in a particular context" [...] This definition {{can be applied to the}} U.S.-led war on terror, in which conflict features such as the phenomenon of Anti-Americanism and the phenomenon of non-Arab countries like Iran and Afghanistan lending support to Islamist-based terrorism by funding or harboring terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and al-Qaeda against Western nations, particularly Israel and the United States are, according to social categorization theory, influenced by a three-stage process of identification. In this three-stage process of identification, the Arab and Muslim world(s) are the social group(s), in which their members learn stereotypes and norms which categorize their social group vis-à-vis the West. This social categorization process creates feelings of high-level in-group support and allegiance among Arabs and Muslims and the particular context within which members of the Arab and Muslim world(s) social group(s) understand all situations that involve the West. Social categorization theory as a framework for analysis indicates causal relationships between group identification processes and features of <b>conflict</b> <b>situations.</b>|$|E

They also recommend to the entertainment industry that the depiction of the consequences of violent behavior be associated with negative social consequences and that they support a rating system which accurately reflects the content of video games and interactive media.
