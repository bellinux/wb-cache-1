5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more <b>conventional</b> <b>design</b> promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|Because of its ongoing {{structural}} weaknesses, in 1957 the London County Council proposed {{replacing the}} Albert Bridge {{with a more}} <b>conventional</b> <b>design.</b> A protest campaign led by John Betjeman resulted in {{the withdrawal of the}} proposal, but serious concerns about the integrity of the bridge continued. In 1964 an experimental tidal flow scheme was introduced, in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the bridge in the mornings and southbound traffic in the evenings. The bridge's condition continued to deteriorate however, and in 1970 the Greater London Council (GLC) sought and obtained consent to carry out strengthening work. In April 1972 the bridge was closed for the work to be carried out.|$|E
5|$|Partially {{because of}} the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the entire class to a more <b>conventional</b> <b>design</b> by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors. Together {{with the lack of}} air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem of smoke and steam obscuring the driver's vision of the line.|$|E
50|$|ST's {{have two}} major {{advantages}} over <b>conventional</b> <b>designs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{first issue}} is that the overall {{pressure}} of the plasma in an ST is lower than <b>conventional</b> <b>designs,</b> in spite of higher beta. This {{is due to the}} limits of the magnetic field {{on the inside of the}} plasma, [...] This limit is theoretically the same in the ST and <b>conventional</b> <b>designs,</b> but as the ST has a much lower aspect ratio, the effective field changes more dramatically over the plasma volume.|$|R

5|$|The YF-22 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Because Lockheed's submission was selected {{as one of the}} winners, the company, through its Skunk Works division, assumed leadership of the program partners. It would be responsible for the forward cockpit and fuselage, as well as final assembly at Palmdale, California. Meanwhile, the wings and aft fuselage would be built by Boeing, with the center fuselage, weapons bays, tail and landing gears built by General Dynamics. Compared with its Northrop/McDonnell Douglas counterpart, the YF-22 has a more <b>conventional</b> <b>design</b> – its wings have larger control surfaces, such as full-span trailing edge, and, whereas the YF-23 had two tail surfaces, the YF-22 had four, which made it more maneuverable than its counterpart. Two examples of each prototype air vehicle (PAV) were built for the Demonstration-Validation phase: one with General Electric YF120 engines, the other with Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines.|$|E
5|$|In August 1947, Chadwick {{was killed}} in the crash of the Avro Tudor 2 {{prototype}} and was succeeded by Sir William Farren. Reductions in wing thickness made it impossible to incorporate the split bomb bays and stacked engines, thus the engines were placed side-by-side in pairs either side of a single bomb-bay, with the fuselage growing somewhat. The wingtip fins gave way to a single fin on the aircraft's centreline. Rival manufacturer Handley Page received a prototype contract for its crescent-winged HP.80 B.35/46 tender in November 1947. Though considered the best option, contract placement for Avro's design was delayed whilst its technical strength was established. Instructions to proceed with the construction of two Avro 698 prototypes was received in January 1948. As an insurance measure against both radical designs failing, Short Brothers received a contract for the prototype SA.4 to the less-stringent Specification B.14/46; the SA.4, later named Sperrin, was not required. In April 1948, Vickers also received authority to proceed with their Type 660 which, although falling short of the B.35/46 Specification, being of a more <b>conventional</b> <b>design</b> would be available sooner; this plane entered service as the Valiant.|$|E

40|$|Hypersonic {{research}} {{aircraft design}} requires careful consideration of thermal stresses. This paper relates {{some of the}} problems in a heat sink structural design that can be avoided by appropriate selection of design options including material selection, design concepts, and load paths. Data on several thermal loading conditions are presented on various <b>conventional</b> <b>designs</b> including bulkheads, longerons, fittings, and frames. Results indicate that <b>conventional</b> <b>designs</b> are inadequate and that acceptable designs are possible by incorporating innovative design practices. These include nonintegral pressure compartments, ball-jointed links to distribute applied loads without restraining the thermal expansion, and material selections based on thermal compatibility...|$|R
40|$|<b>Conventional</b> <b>designs</b> on two-way relay {{networks}} mainly {{focus on}} the spectral efficiency (SE) rather than energy efficiency (EE). In this paper, we consider a system where two source nodes {{communicate with each other}} via an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay node and study the power allocation schemes to maximize EE while ensuring a certain data rate. We propose an optimal energy-efficient power allocation algorithm based on iterative search technique. In addition, a closed-form suboptimal solution is derived with reduced complexity and negligible performance degradation. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes can achieve considerable EE improvement compared with <b>conventional</b> <b>designs...</b>|$|R
25|$|The N.1 was a two-bay biplane of <b>conventional</b> <b>design,</b> with {{staggered}} wings, two open cockpits in tandem, and fixed, tailskid undercarriage. At {{least eight}} aircraft were built {{during the war}} and converted to P.I standard after the Armistice.|$|E
25|$|The Type 38 75mm Field Gun was a {{thoroughly}} <b>conventional</b> <b>design</b> for its day, complete with crew {{seats on the}} gun shield and a solid box trail. It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield.|$|E
25|$|After the Caproni company {{completed}} initial {{testing of}} the Stipa-Caproni, the Regia Aeronautica took control of it and conducted a brief series of additional tests, but did not develop it further because the Stipa-Caproni offered no performance improvement over aircraft of <b>conventional</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the solid}} blanket {{materials}} used to surround the fusion chamber in <b>conventional</b> <b>designs</b> are replaced by a fluorine lithium beryllium (FLiBe) molten salt that can easily be circulated/replaced, reducing maintenance costs.|$|R
50|$|START proved Peng and Strickler's predictions; the ST had {{performance}} {{an order}} of magnitude better than <b>conventional</b> <b>designs,</b> and cost much less to build as well. In terms of overall economics, the ST was an enormous step forward.|$|R
40|$|A new {{enclosed}} {{injector system}} for low temperature kinetic studies is described. This system offers {{a number of}} advantages over more <b>conventional</b> <b>designs</b> of moveable inlet injectors. The enclosed injector prevents the introduction of contaminants into the flow reactor. In <b>conventional</b> <b>designs,</b> ambient contaminants adsorbed onto {{the outside of the}} injector could be transported into the flow reactor. The enclosed injector exposes the reactant gas to the same length of inlet tubing at a uniform temperature regardless of the injector position. In addition, the enclosed injector minimizes temperature gradients in the flow reactor caused by heat transfer along the injector. This is a particular problem when the flow reactor is operated near atmospheric pressure at reduced temperatures. Finally, this design is significantly more compact than <b>conventional</b> injector <b>designs.</b> This system has been successfully employed in studies of the heterogeneous reaction of N 2 O 5 with sulfuric acid aerosols over the temperature range 225 – 293 K...|$|R
25|$|It {{was a low}} wing, {{cantilever}} monoplane of <b>conventional</b> <b>design</b> {{and mixed}} construction. The main units of the tailwheel undercarriage were retractable, and the cabin was fully enclosed, offering side-by-side seating. The Italian press of the day nicknamed it Topolino dell'Aria ("Little mouse of the air").|$|E
25|$|Each {{engine was}} in the 2,450lbf (10.9kN) thrust class with a thrust to weight ratio goal of 10:1. General Electric was awarded a {{contract}} {{for the development of}} the General Electric J85 and Fairchild was awarded a contract for the a competing engine the Fairchild J83. Fairchild proposed a lightweight engine of <b>conventional</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, British {{inventor}} James Dyson {{introduced the}} Ballbarrow, an injection molded plastic wheelbarrow with a spherical {{ball on the}} front end instead of a wheel. Compared to a <b>conventional</b> <b>design,</b> the larger surface area of the ball made the wheelbarrow easier to use in soft soil, and more laterally stable with heavy loads on uneven ground.|$|E
50|$|Combining left-handed {{segments}} with {{a conventional}} (right-handed) transmission line results in advantages over <b>conventional</b> <b>designs.</b> Left-handed transmission lines are essentially a high-pass filter with phase advance. Conversely, right-handed transmission lines are a low-pass filter with phase lag. This configuration is designated composite right/left-handed (CRLH) metamaterial.|$|R
50|$|Although Taylor {{continued}} {{to push for}} {{the viability of the}} flying car throughout the rest of his life, he also designed a number of only slightly more <b>conventional</b> <b>designs</b> for the homebuilt aircraft market, including the Taylor Coot amphibian and the Aerocar IMP family of sportsplane designs.|$|R

25|$|The PIK-15 Hinu {{was a light}} {{aircraft}} developed in Finland in the 1960s {{for use as a}} glider tug. It was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of <b>conventional</b> <b>design</b> with an enclosed cockpit and fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. The cockpit had two seats, side-by-side, and the PIK-15 was intended to have a secondary role as a trainer. Construction was of wood throughout.|$|E
25|$|The Type 38 150mm Howitzer was a <b>conventional</b> <b>design</b> for its day, {{complete}} with crew {{seats on the}} gun shield and a solid box trail. It had a hydrospring recoil system, interrupted screw type breechblock, and 1/16-inch gun shield. It {{was designed to be}} moved by a team of eight horses, but in practice, its heavy weight was a problem.|$|E
25|$|The PIK-11 Tumppu ("Mitten") was a single-seat, {{single-engine}} sport aircraft {{developed in}} Finland in the 1950s. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane of <b>conventional</b> <b>design</b> with an enclosed cockpit and fixed, tailwheel undercarriage. It {{was to be}} the first powered aircraft produced by Polyteknikkojen Ilmailukerho, with the objective being building an aircraft for club use that was cheap to build and easy to fly.|$|E
50|$|In firearms, {{downward}} ejecting {{refers to}} firearms which eject spent cases downward from the firearm's receiver, {{rather than the}} more <b>conventional</b> <b>designs</b> which eject the brass to the side. This feature simplifies use by left-handers, and can help prevent gases and debris from being ejected near the shooter's face.|$|R
50|$|Lotus 12 was {{the first}} Lotus to be fitted with the iconic wobbly-web wheels. Reflecting Chapman's {{emphasis}} on engineering for lightness, these were cast in magnesium alloy, a kind of crimped cylinder, resulting in minimum material and maximum strength, without the weaknesses induced by slots in <b>conventional</b> <b>designs.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Conventional</b> {{aircraft}} <b>designs</b> {{have long}} been highly successful for commercial passengers transport markets. In recent years, there are researches carried out to explore a few revolutionary concepts such as the blended wing body. With expected stricter environmental regulations to be imposed by the aviation regulatory bodies for future flight operations, questions arise on the relevancy of <b>conventional</b> aircraft <b>designs</b> to remain competitive {{in years to come}} and on whether the search for new revolutionary aircraft designs has become necessary. This study aims to assess the situation by analyzing the projected emission performance of <b>conventional</b> aircraft <b>designs</b> through changes of their parameters. Overall, the results indicate that <b>conventional</b> aircraft <b>designs</b> face a tough chance to remain competitive when the proposed regulation takes place and a more aerodynamically efficient design is necessary...|$|R
25|$|The PIK-3 (Polyteknikkojen Ilmailukerho – Finnish {{institute}} of technology students flying club) was a sailplane produced in Finland in the 1950s and 60s. It {{was designed to be}} a cheap and easy-to-build aircraft to equip the country's gliding clubs as their standard single-seat machine. It was a <b>conventional</b> <b>design</b> for its day, with a high wing and conventional empennage. Construction was of wood throughout, skinned in plywood.|$|E
25|$|It {{was from}} around 1770 that Arnold {{developed}} the portable precision timekeeper, {{almost from the}} point where John Harrison ended his work in this field. But, compared to Harrison's complicated and expensive watch, Arnold's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable. Importantly, the relatively simple and <b>conventional</b> <b>design</b> of his movement facilitated its production in quantity {{at a reasonable price}} whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment.|$|E
