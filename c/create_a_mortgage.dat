50|$|The {{most common}} {{benefit to the}} homeowner is the {{prevention}} of foreclosure because loss mitigation works to either relieve the homeowner of the debt or <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> resolution that is financially sustainable for the homeowner. Lenders benefit by mitigating the losses they would incur through foreclosing on the homeowner. Immediate foreclosure creates a tremendous financial burden on the lender.|$|E
50|$|When {{the housing}} market crashed in 2008, tax-exempt bonds {{switched}} places with taxable bonds and sold at a higher price. This {{made it impossible for}} the corporation to issue more bonds to finance mortgage loans. UHC then switched to a different business model by copying the mortgage bankers. Instead of issuing bonds and using the cash to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> loan, UHC now borrows the cash (from their own cash reserves) to create mortgage loans, then bundles multiple mortgage loans together and sells them as mortgage-backed securities in order to get their money back and then lend it out again which creates a recurring source of revenue. UHC also offers a down payment assistance loans to help buyers without a down payment. In 2012, Governor Herbert helped announce two new loans to help fulfill Utah Housing’s mission, one of which is a loan that offers no mortgage insurance to help keep payments lower for borrowers.|$|E

50|$|An {{equitable}} mortgage {{can arise}} {{in two different}} ways - either as <b>a</b> legal <b>mortgage</b> which was never perfected by conveying the underlying assets, or by specifically <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> as <b>an</b> equitable <b>mortgage.</b> <b>A</b> <b>mortgage</b> over equitable rights (such as a beneficiary's interests under a trust) will necessarily exist in equity only in any event.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the underlying fairness of applying equitable security presumptions to the deposit of title documents belonging to third parties. It argues that within such transactions, {{the focus of the}} equitable jurisdiction must be upon the intention of the owner of the title documents rather than presumptions arising from the fact of the deposit. It suggests that there is no logic in applying equitable presumptions, founded on the principles of part performance, to infer a security intention in transactions involving third party title documents. The fact that the parties to a loan advance may have intended to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> between themselves {{does not mean that the}} third party owner of the title documents also intended to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>mortgage.</b> In third party transactions, the objectives of the equity jurisdiction are best achieved through a comprehensive assessment of the intention of all parties and the abolition of presumptions based upon the bare fact of title deposit. <br /...|$|E

Ultimately, Denali FCU decided to purchase <b>an</b> Alaska <b>mortgage</b> firm rather than <b>create</b> <b>a</b> full-service <b>mortgage</b> department from scratch.” The purchase allowed Denali FCU to offer conventional investor-backed mortgage products, such as VA, FHA or AHFC loans, which it did not offer prior to the purchase of Northern Pacific Mortgage.

5000|$|Lewis {{argued that}} Salomon Brothers' mortgage-bond success was {{based not on}} innate {{intelligence}} or trading skill, but on pure luck. Lewis noted that, although Ranieri was often hailed as a [...] "visionary" [...] for <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> department before <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> market existed, deregulation caught him completely by surprise. The firms that lured away Salomon's traders with higher salaries ended up losing money, as {{it soon became clear}} that the traders lacked any special skills: they just happened to be working in <b>mortgages</b> during <b>a</b> period of rising bond prices. After enough firms became involved with mortgage bonds, prices stabilized, and the bonds eventually traded like any others.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of real estate, {{the most common form}} of secured debt is the lien. Liens may either be voluntarily <b>created,</b> as with <b>a</b> <b>mortgage,</b> or involuntarily <b>created,</b> such as <b>a</b> {{mechanics}} lien. <b>A</b> <b>mortgage</b> may only be created with the express consent of the title owner, without regard to other facts of the situation. In contrast, the primary condition required to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> mechanics lien is that real estate is somehow improved through the work or materials provided by the person filing a mechanics lien. Although the rules are complex, consent of the title owner to the mechanics lien itself is not required.|$|R

50|$|To give Americans {{confidence}} in the financial system, Congress enacted the Glass-Steagall Act, which curbed speculation by limiting the investments commercial banks could make and ending affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms. Hoarding of gold was made illegal, in preparation for Roosevelt's effort to pump up inflation rates. The president was given {{more control over the}} Federal Reserve System.

50|$|During 2007, as {{negative}} information about U.S. residential mortgages spreads out, securities backed with mortgages, including sub-prime mortgages, widely held by ABCP programs of financial firms globally, started {{to lose their}} value. ABCP investors started {{to worry about the}} value of the asset backing their ABCP and stopped rolling over their position. At the beginning, sponsor banks have enough liquid to pay off these liabilities, but lack of market confidence can <b>create</b> <b>a</b> subprime <b>mortgage</b> crisis. On August 2007, the French bank BNP Paribas halted withdrawals from three funds invested in ABCP and suspended calculation of net asset values. Even though defaults on mortgages had been rising throughout 2007, the suspension of withdrawals by BNP Paribas has a profound effect on ABCP market. The interest rate spread of over-night ABCP and Federal funds rate increased from 10 basis points to 150 basis points within one day of announcement.|$|R
50|$|Brokers {{must also}} {{disclose}} Yield spread premium while Bankers do not. This has <b>created</b> <b>an</b> ambiguous and difficult {{identification of the}} true cost to obtain <b>a</b> <b>mortgage.</b> The government <b>created</b> <b>a</b> new Good Faith Estimate (2010 version) to allow consumers to compare apples to apples in all fees related to <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> whether you are shopping <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> broker or <b>a</b> direct lender. The government's reason for this was some mortgage brokers were utilizing bait and switch tactics to quote one rate and fees only to change before the loan documents were created. Although ambiguous for the mortgage brokers to disclose this, they decide what fees to charge upfront whereas the direct lender won't know what they make overall until the loan is sold.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the prospects for}} securitization of real estate assets in Brazil. Brazilian real estate securitization is in its infancy. The economical importance of the country, its relatively well-developed financial markets, the globalization of capital markets, and the increasing demand for real estate securities, however, argues {{for the advancement of}} real estate securitization in Brazil. Real estate operations have been financed with debt and equity securities over the last years. On the debt side, the S. F. I. (Sistema Financeiro Imobiliario), an initiative designed to parallel the mortgage backed securities model in the U. S., is intended to broaden the supply of real estate financing in Brazil and to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> secondary <b>mortgage</b> market. Residential, industrial, commercial and other kinds of real estate loans will serve as collateral. One or more public issuers will buy and package mortgages to issue securities, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do in the U.

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>mortgage</b> is <b>a</b> {{security}} interest in realty <b>created</b> by <b>a</b> written instrument (traditionally a deed) that either conveys legal title or hypothecates title {{by way of}} a non-possessory lien to a lender for the performance under the terms of <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> note. In slightly less than half of states, <b>a</b> <b>mortgage</b> <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> lien on the title to the mortgaged property. Foreclosure of that lien almost always requires a judicial proceeding declaring the debt to be due and in default and ordering a sale of the property to pay the debt. Many <b>mortgages</b> contain <b>a</b> power of sale clause, also known as nonjudicial foreclosure clause, making them equivalent to a deed of trust. Most [...] "mortgages" [...] in California are actually deeds of trust. The effective difference is that the foreclosure process can be much faster for a deed of trust than for <b>a</b> <b>mortgage,</b> on the order of 3 months rather than a year. Because this foreclosure does not require actions by the court, the transaction costs can be quite a bit less.|$|R

40|$|Bearing in {{mind that}} land {{acquisition}} is very crucial to human development from ages past, the study examined private land acquisition processes and challenges encountered by individuals in Ado-odo/Ota Local government area of Ogun State. Using purposive sampling method, the study gathered relevant data from four different community leaders as well as four heads of family land owners {{with the aid of}} questionnaires and employed indepth interviews to solicit information from eight different youth leaders from the four selected communities. Four each of local artisans (bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers and electricians) available on sites under construction between March and May, 2014 were interviewed on their experiences within the selected neighbourhoods. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics while percentages and ranking were employed in analysis. Data presentation was basically in tables. The study found that because past governments had failed {{to take into account the}} needs and interests of individual, family or community land owners during earlier compulsory land acquisition processes, family land owners are in a hurry to sell off their land even when existing developments are far away. The study recommends that government needs to be proactive in designing new neighbourhood layouts to forestall large informal settlements and, at the same time, implement new methods of financing infrastructure to support urban land development. Finally, government needs to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> friendlier <b>mortgage</b> finance system that will make it possible for low-income households to acquire shelter or land at affordable prices...|$|R
