50|$|Another {{difference}} can {{be observed}} when inspecting {{the side of the}} thorax. The <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly</b> has only one small black stripe there, while all other blue damselflies have two. A male is blue while a female is brown on a <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>{{damselfly}}</b> can {{be easily}} mistaken for the azure damselfly (Coenagrion puella), but {{on the back and}} the thorax, the <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly</b> has more blue than black; for the azure damselfly it is the other way around. The second segment of the thorax has a distinctive spot with a line below connecting to the third segment.|$|E

50|$|More than 250 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} at this remnant of the Royal Forest of Rockingham, including ones characteristic of ancient woods including yellow archangel and wood anemone. There are diverse invertebrates such as green-veined white butterflies and <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselflies,</b> and birds include treecreepers, long-tailed tits, green woodpeckers and tawny owls.|$|R
50|$|The diatoms genera Capucina and Asterionella {{have been}} recorded, {{together}} with blue-green algae, copepods, and some rotifers. oligochaete worms, snails, freshwater louse, leeches, mayflies, caddisfly larvae, beetles, chironomid larvae, six-spotted burnet moth, green-veined white, <b>common</b> <b>blue,</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly,</b> are all present.|$|R
50|$|Segments {{three to}} five are blue with broader black {{terminal}} bands, lacking the forward-pointing projection the upper surface which adult male <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly</b> has. Segment six has a similar pattern but with more restricted blue and a broader area of black, and segment seven is mostly black, with just a narrow blue area at the base. Segment eight and much of segment nine are sky-blue, forming a noticeable contrasting patch, but there are small dark markings on the rear upper side of segment nine, which adult male <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly</b> does not possess.|$|E
50|$|Enallagma cyathigerum (<b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly,</b> common bluet, or {{northern}} bluet) is a European damselfly.The {{species can}} reach {{a length of}} 32 to 35 mm. It is common in all of Europe, except for Iceland.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} similar to the azure {{damselfly}} (C. puella), the variable damselfly (C. pulchellum) and the <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Enallagma cyathigerum) with which it coexists. However, both the female and male are darker and shorter-bodied in comparison with other blue damselflies.|$|E
50|$|Whooper swans {{and many}} other watefowl use the site. Roe deer use the {{surrounding}} scrub area and water lilies are {{a feature of the}} western end of the loch. Mute swans, heron, tufted duck, great crested grebe, and kingfisher are also present. Feeding and breeding in the surrounding wetland scrub are a variety of finches and even reed warblers, a notable species on the red data list. Meadow Brown butterflies are seen here as well as <b>Common</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Damselflies</b> in the water vegetation at the west end of the loch with Common Hawker and Large Red Damselflies in drier habitat at the east end.|$|R
25|$|There is {{one small}} pond in Sydenham Hill Wood {{which has been}} {{enhanced}} {{over the years and}} is surveyed by volunteers. Common frog and smooth newt are resident, as well as southern hawker dragonfly, <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> and red-tailed <b>damselflies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Animal {{communication}} {{relies on}} conspicuous signals and compatible signal perception abilities. Good signal perception abilities {{are particularly important}} for polymorphic animals where mate choice can be a challenge. Behavioral studies suggest that polymorphic damselflies use their varying body colorations and/or color patterns as communication signal for mate choice and to control mating frequencies. However, solid evidence for this hypothesis combining physiological with spectral and behavioral data is scarce. We investigated this question in the Australian <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> tail <b>damselfly,</b> Ischnura heterosticta, which has pronounced female-limited polymorphism: andromorphs have a male-like blue coloration and gynomorphs display green/grey colors. We measured body color reflectance and investigated the visual capacities of each morph, showing that I. heterosticta have at least three types of photoreceptors sensitive to UV, blue, and green wavelength, and that this visual perception ability enables them to detect the spectral properties of the color signals emitted from the various color morphs in both males and females. We further demonstrate that different color morphs can be discriminated against {{each other and the}} vegetation based on color contrast. Finally, these findings were supported by field observations of natural mating pairs showing that mating partners are indeed chosen based on their body coloration. Our study provides the first comprehensive evidence for the function of body coloration on mate choice in polymorphic damselflies...|$|R
50|$|A {{relatively}} {{large number of}} species of dragonfly and damselfly are recorded, as well as good populations of southern aeshna, common sympetrum and <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly.</b> The emperor dragonfly visits occasionally. Patches of nettle and thistle attract many butterflies and teasel attracts brimstones and encourages goldfinches.|$|E
50|$|Cole Mere is {{the only}} English site for the least water-lily. and the meadow {{in the spring and}} summer is perfect for flowers such as the {{southern}} marsh orchid, meadow cranesbill and ladyâ€™s smock.

50|$|Arabicnemis is a {{monotypic}} genus of damselflies in {{the family}} Platycnemididae containing the single species Arabicnemis caerulea. It is known commonly as the powder <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly.</b> It is endemic to the Arabian Peninsula, where it occurs in Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.|$|R
50|$|Platycnemis pennipes {{is about}} 32 mm long. Mature adults differ from most other <b>blue</b> <b>damselflies</b> in having {{expanded}} white edges to the tibiae, paired black markings down {{most of the}} abdomen, broad pale brown double antehumeral stripes, wider head and a pale brown pterostigmata.|$|R
50|$|The shores are {{dominated}} by various species of Oligochaeta, Gastropoda, and Odonata. Superficial sediments {{are dominated}} by Oligochaeta and non-biting midges while deeper layers contain the freshwater crustacean Asellus aquaticus and larvae of mayflies and Odonatas. Gyraulus crista and Hippeutis complanatus are unusual freshwater snails present in the lake. The most common dragonfly is the emerald damselfly, but azure damselfly, variable damselfly, scarce emerald damselfly, <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly,</b> downy emerald, and red-eyed damselfly are also present. In Stockholm, Aeshna osiliensis is unique to Norra DjurgÃ¥rden, while the large white-faced darter is protected by the EU.|$|E
50|$|Aylesford Green is an {{attractive}} area for informal recreation. The site {{has a variety of}} habitats including a wide margin of long vegetation by the Aylesford Stream that forms an important habitat for invertebrates. A small wooded area dominated by ash and alder borders Boys Hall Road. Wood mice have been recorded in this area and long-tailed tits are often seen perching in ash trees, particularly in winter. Pollarded willows by the Aylesford Stream provide {{an attractive}} area adjacent to Bentley Road. The site is linked to South Willesborough by a pedestrian bridge over High Speed 1 onto Newtown Road. Banded demoiselle and <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly</b> have been recorded at the site.|$|E
50|$|Damselflies have {{a variety}} of {{internal}} and external parasites. Particularly prevalent are the gregarine protozoans found in the gut. In a study of the European <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly,</b> every adult insect was infected {{at the height of the}} flying season. When present in large numbers, these parasites can cause death by blocking the gut. Bright red water mites Hydracarina are often seen on the outside of both nymphs and adults, and can move from one to the other at metamorphosis. They suck the body fluids and may actually kill young nymphs, but adults are relatively unaffected, it being necessary for the completion of the mite's life cycle that it returns to water, a feat accomplished when the adult damselfly breeds.|$|E
50|$|Norfolk {{damselfly}} or dark bluet (Coenagrion armatum) is {{a species}} of <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly</b> of the family Coenagrionidae. This species acquired its common name from its discovery in 1903 and presence in a very restricted area of the Norfolk Broads. Records came from Sutton, Stalham, and Hickling Broads.|$|R
5000|$|Azuragrion granti is, {{typically}} for narrow-winged dragonflies, {{a largely}} <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly</b> with black markings {{on top of}} the head, black stripes along the thorax and on {{the upper part of the}} abdomen which is paler underneath. It has narrow, transparent wings it holds vertically over their body when it is at rest.|$|R
50|$|Its central range {{helps to}} {{distinguish}} it from the other <b>blue</b> <b>damselflies</b> with which it is easily confused,especially the similar looking vivid dancer.The Apache dancer is larger, but with an overall length of 34-40mm the springwater tends to be larger thanthe other similar blue dancers including the lavender dancer.The stripe {{on the side of}} the thorax is forked in the Aztec dancer and variable dancer.|$|R
50|$|The dainty {{damselfly}} (Coenagrion scitulum), {{also known}} as the dainty bluet, is a blue damselfly of the family Coenagrionidae. This is a scarce species found mainly in southern Europe, northern Africa, southwest Asia, and Central America. C. scitulum are Odonata (dragonflies & damselflies) predators that can reach a length of 30-33 mm at maturity and have hind-wing lengths of 15-20 mm. The males and females do exhibit differing features through their colouration making them easily distinguishable. As shown in the photo to the left, segment eight is blue in colour followed by black markings on segment nine, whereas the females are mostly black near the rear with smaller blue markings. Although they are relatively simple to sex, they are easily confused with the <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly.</b>|$|E
50|$|Singleton Lake is a {{man-made}} fishing lake, it has areas of willow and alder around its perimeter {{as well as}} small areas of reedbed. At night Daubenton's bat can be seen flying over the water. There are 2 sculptures by Antony Gormley (creator of the Angel of the North sculpture) and a stretch of boardwalk. Singleton Lake supports a variety of common bird species, as well as birds that {{are unlikely to be}} seen elsewhere in the Green Corridor including great crested grebe and reed warbler. Two damselfly species have been recorded at the site, <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly</b> and blue-tailed damselfly. Singleton Lake has parking, picnic areas and good links {{to the rest of the}} Green Corridor and wider countryside in the Great Chart area.|$|E
50|$|The sparse fauna {{before the}} {{dredging}} of the lake, after 1995 {{evolved into a}} pretty considerable variety of species typical for shallow lakes rich in nutrients. Two species of freshwater snails, Bithynia leachii and Gyraulus crista, were earlier considered as endangered. Noteworthy is also the population of several freshwater mussels, duck mussel and swan mussel, and Hippeutis complanatus, the latter two declining. A species of Oligochaeta new in Sweden {{has been reported in}} the lake just like did the rare hairy dragonfly. An inventory of dragonfly larvae in 2000 unveiled several other species (mostly red-eyed damselfly but also <b>common</b> <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly,</b> azure damselfly, variable damselfly, and northern damselfly (Coenagrion hastulatum). Fish population reflects the shortage of oxygen with an absence of carp bream and silver bream and an abundance of perch, roach, and crucian carp dating back to before the dredging. The outlet forms a threshold for migrating species.|$|E
50|$|The slender bluet, as its {{common name}} implies is a <b>blue</b> <b>damselfly</b> {{with a thin}} abdomen. The eyespots of both genders are large, with a thin blue line between them.
