5000|$|Prior to 1825, Rondout {{was a small}} farming village. Construction of the Delaware and Hudson Canal from Rondout to Honesdale, Pennsylvania, {{brought an}} influx of laborers. With the {{completion}} of the canal in 1828, Rondout became an important tide-ware coal terminal. Natural cement deposits were found throughout the valley, and in 1844 quarrying began in the [...] "Ponchockie" [...] section of Rondout.

Large warehouses of ice sat beside the Hudson River from which the ice was cut during the winter and preserved all year to be used in early refrigeration.

Rondout's central location as a shipping hub ended with the advent of railroads which ran through Rondout and Kingston but could transport their loads through the city without stopping.|$|R

50|$|The second {{count for}} the perjury charge was {{with regard to}} the {{evidence}} of the appellant that he (the appellant) and the respondent agreed not to start business until the formation of a new Company by the appellant. In his evidence the appellant later corrected himself that this was untrue. The court found that the appellant’s difficulties in giving a straightforward evidence about the formation of the new Company was based on the apparent difficulties or untold problems he faced in his business and, the fact that in one occasion <b>cement</b> was <b>shipped</b> to him in his name in Lagos from Germany by the Plaintiff and in another breath <b>cement</b> was <b>shipped</b> to him in the new Company’s name. The court found as a fact that this inconsistency in the shipments of cement accounted to the appellant’s inability to answer the question put to him during cross examination. At any rate the court found that the evidence {{as to whether or not}} the parties were not to start business until the new Company was formed was not material to the question whether the appellant held himself out as the agent personally responsible for monies on all cement sold out to customers on credit.|$|R

5000|$|The {{competitive}} {{power rating}} span of standardized CCVs ranges from few megawatts up to many tens of megawatts. CCVs {{are used for}} driving mine hoists, rolling mill main motors, ball mills for ore processing, <b>cement</b> kilns, <b>ship</b> propulsion systems, slip power recovery wound-rotor induction motors (i.e., Scherbius drives) and aircraft 400 Hz power generation. The variable-frequency output of a cycloconverter can be reduced essentially to zero. This means that very large motors can be started on full load at very slow revolutions, and brought gradually up to full speed. This is invaluable with, for example, ball mills, allowing starting with a full load rather than the alternative of having to start the mill with an empty barrel then progressively load it to full capacity. A fully loaded [...] "hard start" [...] for such equipment would essentially be applying full power to a stalled motor. Variable speed and reversing are essential to processes such as hot-rolling steel mills. Previously, SCR-controlled DC motors were used, needing regular brush/commutator servicing and delivering lower efficiency. Cycloconverter-driven synchronous motors need less maintenance and give greater reliability and efficiency. Single-phase bridge CCVs have also been used extensively in electric traction applications to for example produce 25 Hz power in the U.S. and 16 2/3 Hz power in Europe.|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{experimental}} and archive research {{as well as on}} historical photo-graphs, the article analyzes the composition, origin and formation background of cement stone blocks (the blocks of hardened Portland cement paste) laid along the southern breakwater of Klaipeda port on the seaside of the Curonian Spit at Kopgalis and periodically uncovered during big storms. The surface condition, internal structure and chemical and mineral composition of these blocks provide sufficient evidence for an assessment that the blocks were formed from Portland cement hydrated in sea water without mixing (in dormant state) over a long time. The archive documents of Klaipeda port and investigation into the press publications of that period in question have evidenced that these barrel-shaped cement stone blocks relate to the shipment of Portland cement that was delivered from Gotland Island, most probably from Slite cement factory on the boat Grisslan that sank in the port entrance channel in 1924. The shipment (about 340 tons) was ordered by Lithuanian company Sandėlis. The composition of Portland <b>cement</b> <b>shipped</b> from Sweden {{is similar to that of}} modern Portland cement, however, it has a relatively higher content of chrome oxide; cement stone blocks also display the stripes of lime. These are the features characteristic of Portland cement produced at the turn of the 20 th century. A long-term contact of the block with sea water resulted in higher salt content in the blocks. The motor sailing-boat sank due to technical reasons – low engine capacity and rigging not suitable for the stormy weather. During investigation into sinking accident, neither the captain and the crew nor the pilots and other port services were found at fault. The accident, its causes and response to the effects were immediately and precisely, however not in sufficient detail, covered by Klaipeda periodicals of different political orientation in 1924. The similarity of offi-cial reports on boat sinking accident delivered to the Ministry of Transport and Communication and articles in Klaipeda newspapers reveal close cooperation between port administration and reporters.   Article in Lithuanian Remiantis eksperimentiniais ir archyviniais tyrimais, straipsnyje įvardijama Kuršių nerijos Kopgalio pakrantėje prie Klaipėdos uosto pietinio molo suguldytų ir periodiškai didelių audrų metu atidengiamų bei iš istorinių nuotraukų rinkinių žinomų cementinio akmens luitų kilmė. Šių luitų paviršiaus būklės, vidinės struktūros ir cheminės bei mineralinės sudėties ypatybės leidžia teigti, kad jie susidarė iš jūros vandenyje be permaišymo hidratavusio ir pakrantėje ilgai išgulėjusio portlandcemenčio.

30|$|A {{conceptual}} {{environmental problem}} associated with urbanization and industrialization {{in space and}} time is the increased heavy metal pollution (Nriagu 1990). Originating from various anthropogenic and natural sources, metals are eventually released into aquatic or atmospheric systems, although the anthropogenic inputs in environments have increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution (Nriagu 1979; Thevenon et al. 2011). Bangladesh being a developing country is experiencing rapid industrial developments and unplanned urban growth in recent years (Mia et al. 2015), but pollutants produced by these activities are triggering environmental problems on an unprecedented scale, primarily due to arsenic and other heavy metal pollution (Tareq et al. 2003; Bhuiyan et al. 2011; Islam et al. 2015 a; Sharifuzzaman et al. 2016). For example, the aquatic ecosystems of Chittagong, which is a second largest city, main seaport and economic nerve-centre of the country, is under multiple stresses due to discharge of effluents from textile and <b>cement</b> industries, <b>ship</b> recycling, oil refineries, tanneries, paint manufacturing and dyeing plants, paper and rayon mills, naval and merchant ships, steel and engineering factories, fertilizer and other chemical industries as well as disposal of sewage and solid wastes directly into the adjacent Karnaphuli River (KR) and coastal waters of Bay of Bengal (Chowdhury et al. 1999; Hossain and Khan 2002; Ali et al. 2016). The presence of toxic and hazardous substances in river, estuary and marine environments not only affects the ecosystem integrity (Rahman et al. 2014) but also poses substantial threats to public health and welfare in Bangladesh (Alam et al. 2003; Islam et al. 2014).|$|R
50|$|As {{late as the}} 1820s, Rondout was a small hamlet.

After the opening of the canal in 1828, the area of Rondout rapidly transformed from farmland into a thriving maritime village. The last several miles of the canal, which linked coal mines in northeastern Pennsylvania to the Hudson River and markets beyond, followed Rondout Creek to reach the Hudson River. Irish laborers came to dig the canal and many of them stayed to work on it after its completion. Businessmen established stores to serve the workers.
