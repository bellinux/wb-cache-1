5000|$|Praxis {{intervention}} {{is a form}} of participatory action research that emphasizes working on the praxis potential, or phronesis, of its participants. This contrasts with other forms of participatory action research, which emphasize the <b>collective</b> <b>modification</b> of the external world [...] Praxis potential means the members' potential to reflexively work on their respective mentalities; participant here refers not just to the clientele beneficiaries of the praxis intervention project, but also the organisers and experts participating in such a project. Praxis {{intervention is}} intended to lead its members through a [...] "participant objectivation". The method prioritizes unsettling the settled mentalities, especially where the settled mindsets prevalent in the social world or individuals is suspected to have sustained or contributed to their suffering or marginality [...]|$|E
40|$|We {{propose to}} produce neutron-rich nuclei {{in the range}} of the astrophysical r-process around the waiting point N= 126 by fissioning a dense laser-accelerated thorium ion bunch in a thorium target (covered by a CH 2 layer), where the light fission {{fragments}} of the beam fuse with the light fission fragments of the target. Via the 'hole-boring' mode of laser Radiation Pressure Acceleration using a high-intensity, short pulse laser, very efficiently bunches of 232 Th with solid-state density can be generated from a Th layer, placed beneath a deuterated polyethylene foil, both forming the production target. Th ions laser-accelerated to about 7 MeV/u will pass through a thin CH 2 layer placed in front of a thicker second Th foil closely behind the production target and disintegrate into light and heavy fission fragments. In addition, light ions (d,C) from the CD 2 production target will be accelerated as well to about 7 MeV/u, inducing the fission process of 232 Th also in the second Th layer. The laser-accelerated ion bunches with solid-state density, which are about 10 ^ 14 times more dense than classically accelerated ion bunches, allow for a high probability that generated fission products can fuse again. In contrast to classical radioactive beam facilities, where intense but low-density radioactive beams are merged with stable targets, the novel fission-fusion process draws on the fusion between neutron-rich, short-lived, light fission fragments both from beam and target. The high ion beam density may lead to a strong <b>collective</b> <b>modification</b> of the stopping power in the target, leading to significant range enhancement. Using a high-intensity laser as envisaged for the ELI-Nuclear Physics project in Bucharest (ELI-NP), estimates promise a fusion yield of about 10 ^ 3 ions per laser pulse in the mass range of A= 180 - 190, thus enabling to approach the r-process waiting point at N= 126.

40|$|The DNA {{replication}} polymerases δ and 2 ̆ 6 epsiv; have {{an inherent}} proofreading mechanism {{in the form}} of a 32 ̆ 7 → 52 ̆ 7 exonuclease. Upon recognition of errant deoxynucleotide incorporation into DNA, the nascent primer terminus is partitioned to the exonuclease active site where the incorrectly paired nucleotide is excised before resumption of polymerization. The goal of this project was to identify the cellular and molecular consequences of an exonuclease deficiency. The proofreading capability of model system MEFs with EXOII mutations was abolished without altering polymerase function. ^ It was hypothesized that 32 ̆ 7 → 52 ̆ 7 exonucleases of polymerases δ and 2 ̆ 6 epsiv; are critical for prevention of replication stress and important for sensitization to nucleoside analogs. To test this hypothesis, two aims were formulated: Determine the effect of the exonuclease active site mutation on replication related molecular signaling and identify the molecular consequences of an exonuclease deficiency when replication is challenged with nucleoside analogs. ^ Via cell cycle studies it was determined that larger populations of exonuclease deficient cells are in the S-phase. There was an increase in levels of replication proteins, cell population growth and DNA synthesis capacity without alteration in cell cycle progression. These findings led to studies of proteins involved in checkpoint activation and DNA damage sensing. Finally, <b>collective</b> <b>modifications</b> at the level of DNA replication likely affect the strand integrity of DNA at the chromosomal level. ^ Gemcitabine, a DNA directed nucleoside analog is a substrate of polymerases δ and 2 ̆ 6 epsiv; and exploits replication to become incorporated into DNA. Though accumulation of gemcitabine triphosphate was similar in all cell types, incorporation into DNA and rates of DNA synthesis were increased in exonuclease defective cells and were not consistent with clonogenic survival. This led to molecular signaling investigations which demonstrated an increase in S-phase cells and activation of a DNA damage response upon gemcitabine treatment. ^ Collectively, these data indicate that the loss of exonuclease results in a replication stress response that is likely required to employ other repair mechanisms to remove unexcised mismatches introduced into DNA during replication. When challenged with nucleoside analogs, this ongoing stress response coupled with repair serves as a resistance mechanism to cell death. ...|$|R
5000|$|SportsChannel New York officially became Fox Sports New York the {{following}} day on January 28, with the first event aired as a Fox Sports Net outlet that evening being an NBA game between the Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers at Great Western Forum in Inglewood, California.

40|$|Explanations are {{important}} to users {{in a number of}} situations. They provide knowledge about how the system works, what the system knows and does, and why its actions and recommendations are appropriate. Most of the previous approaches to explanations are designed for those types of knowledge-based systems that attempt to capture the knowledge of a narrow application domain. The current tendency to move beyond closed systems to globally open ones creates opportunities but also some challenges. For example, it is a challenge for designers to cope with the dynamic and global nature of information and knowledge represented in the system as well as to structure explanations at the time of design so that they are appropriate at the time of use. This paper contributes to the current literature on explanation, by presenting a discursive framework for collaborative construction and structuring of explanations. It particularly illustrates how the model can be used for the following purposes: (a) for critical reflection on explanations at the time of design and use, (b) for management of justification-type explanation knowledge, and (c) for presentation of explanations. This paper contents that the discursive model, with its concepts and structures, provides a means for <b>collective</b> reflection, <b>modification</b> and validation of explanation knowledge. It can, thus, support the evolution of explanations along with the knowledge domain...|$|R
