Bleeding seal air from plenum chamber to the mill maintains separation between pulverized fuel in the Mill {{and the outside}} atmosphere. Inadequacy or absence of seal air will allow escape of pulverized fuel into atmosphere. On the other hand, an excess of seal air leaking into mill will affect the mill outlet temperature.

50|$|A zone damper (also {{known as}} a Volume <b>Control</b> <b>Damper</b> or VCD) is a {{specific}} type of damper used to control the flow of air in an HVAC heating or cooling system. In order to improve efficiency and occupant comfort, HVAC systems are commonly divided up into multiple zones. For example, in a house, the main floor may be served by one heating zone while the upstairs bedrooms are served by another. In this way, the heat can be directed principally to the main floor during the day and principally to the bedrooms at night, allowing the unoccupied areas to cool down.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, SRAM {{acquired}} suspension manufacturer, RockShox. Teetering on {{the brink}} of bankruptcy in the year prior to the acquisition, RockShox made a dramatic turn around. Quality and OEM assembly lead times were improved as RockShox made a return to prominence in the high-end mountain bike market. A few years later in 2005, SRAM developed a new fork damper technology dubbed “Motion Control” that allowed riders to control low-speed compression and rebound damping, while also providing the ability to firm up the suspension with the flip of a switch. Motion Control was a market success and RockShox continues to use variants of the Motion <b>Control</b> <b>damper</b> on select models.Avid was SRAM’s next acquisition in spring of 2004. Avid produced popular hydraulic disc brakes and gave SRAM one more means to compete with Shimano. Later that same year SRAM purchased Truvativ, a crank, bottom bracket, and chainring manufacturer based out of San Luis Obispo, California. With Truvativ as part of the SRAM family, the company could finally sell a complete drivetrain package to OEM customers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-objective optimization strategy for heavy truck suspension systems based on modified skyhook damping (MSD) control, which improves ride comfort and road-friendliness simultaneously. A four-axle heavy truck-road coupling system model was established using functional virtual prototype technology; the model was then validated through a ride comfort test. As the mechanical properties and time lag of dampers were taken into account, MSD control of active and semi-active dampers was implemented using Matlab/Simulink. Through co-simulations with Adams and Matlab, the effects of passive, semi-active MSD control, and active MSD control were analyzed and compared; thus, control parameters which afforded the best integrated performance were chosen. Simulation results indicated that MSD control improves a truck’s ride comfort and roadfriendliness, while the semi-active MSD <b>control</b> <b>damper</b> obtains road-friendliness comparable to the active MSD <b>control</b> <b>damper...</b>|$|E

By modifying the Chang’s traffic characterization to shift varying setting, we introduce two basic network elements for time varying input traffic models: (i) traffic regulators that generate G-regular marked point processes and (ii) dynamic G-server that provide service guarantees for marked point processes. Similar to shift invariant setting under (max,+) -algebra, network elements can be joined by concatenation, "filter bank summation," and feedback to form a composite network element.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{challenging}} to <b>control</b> the <b>damping</b> forces of magnetorheological (MR) fluid dampers {{because of the}} strong nonlinearity between the damping force of an MR fluid damper and the velocity across the damper, and the semiactive relationship between the damping force and the applied voltage/current. Hence, the desired damping force ought to be generated by an MR fluid damper cannot be commanded directly, only the command voltage applied to the current driver for the MR damper can be directly controlled. In this article, the configuration of a semiactive control system with MR fluid dampers is discussed and a damper controller based on signum function for MR fluid dampers is proposed. The damper controller is used to generate and adjust the command voltage to track the desired damping force determined by the system controller based on the desired and the actual damping forces. Two key factors for <b>controlling</b> the <b>damping</b> force of an MR fluid damper through a damper controller are considered in this article: (1) tracking ability of the <b>controlled</b> <b>damping</b> force to the desired damping force, and (2) energy requirement for the MR fluid damper. The characteristics of the <b>controlled</b> <b>damping</b> force and its corresponding command voltage are analyzed and compared with the Heaviside function damper controller. The simulation {{results show that the}} signum function controller outperforms the Heaviside function controller for better damping tracking ability while requiring less energy for the MR damper.

In order to overcome this problem, efforts have been made to evaluate the efficiency of the biocontrol agent Trichoderma harizanum for <b>controlling</b> the <b>damping</b> off disease in chilli. T. harizanum was isolated from the garden soil and identified through microscopic and recommended standard methods. The antagonistic activity of the T. harizanum was evaluated against the pathogenic fungi responsible for damping disease i. e., Fusarium oxysporium, Rhizoctonia solani and Alternaria alternata proved the efficiency to inhibit the growth of all the above pathogens. The T. harizanum was formulated with talcum powder and applied as foliar spray on damping off diseased chilli plants. After 49 days of treatment, T. harizanum treated chilli plants showed more plant height (75 %), number of leaves (60 %), buds (10 %) and fruits (6 %) than control. Hence we concluded that, T. harizanum can be recommended not only for the <b>control</b> of <b>damping</b> off disease in chilli plants and also to enhance the growth of the plants.

The equation of motion is nonlinear and non-homogenous in nature and has been solved using Taylor's series expansion. Numerical simulation is carried out to extract the performance parameters. The model is capable of predicting the dynamic behavior of the arrester system for variable mass and velocity of landing aircraft.

40|$|Display latency is {{the time}} delay between {{aircraft}} response and the corresponding response of the cockpit displays. Currently, there is no explicit specification for allowable display lags to ensure acceptable aircraft handling qualities in instrument flight conditions. This paper examines the handling qualities effects of display latency between 70 and 400 milliseconds for precision instrument flight tasks of the V- 22 Tiltrotor aircraft. Display delay effects on the pilot control loop are analytically predicted through a second order pilot crossover model of the V- 22 lateral axis, and handling qualities trends are evaluated {{through a series of}} fixed-base piloted simulation tests. The results show that the effects of display latency for flight path tracking tasks are driven by the stability characteristics of the attitude control loop. The data indicate that the loss of <b>control</b> <b>damping</b> due to latency can be simply predicted from knowledge of the aircraft's stability margins, control system lags, and required control bandwidths. Based on the relationship between attitude <b>control</b> <b>damping</b> and handling qualities ratings, latency design guidelines are presented.
