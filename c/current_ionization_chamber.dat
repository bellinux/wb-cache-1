Dynamic and step-and-shoot multileaf collimation (DMLC/SMLC) challenge <b>current</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> dosimetry practices. Ionization chamber performance in these fields is evaluated for three cylindrical chambers of varying volumes (PinPoint (PP) : 0. 015 cm 3, IC 10 : 0. 13 cm 3, Farmer type NE 2571 (FT) : 0. 69 cm 3) in terms of measurement reproducibility, dose measurement linearity, and IMRT dose measurements. Fifty IMRT patient specific quality assurance dose measurements were performed with each chamber. DMLC measurements are compared between chambers, and to dose calculations from a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) that used a finite size pencil-beam model (FSPB). Ten SMLC measurements are compared to Monte Carlo simulations available in the TPS. The three chambers demonstrated adequate measurement reproducibility characteristics for both open and DMLC fields, with each chamber able to perform within 2 % (2 SD) for DMLC fields. Both smaller volume chambers over responded (> 5 %) when irradiated with {{a small number of}} monitor units in open fields. FT and IC 10 chambers demonstrated dose linearity in DMLC fields down to 10 monitor units, while dose linearity for the PP chamber broke down at 100 monitor units. The evaluation of 50 DMLC treatment plan quality assurance procedures revealed that the FT chamber measurements were closest to the FSPB calculated values (FSPB: 1. 0, FT: 0. 973 ± 0. 044, IC 10 : 0. 963 ± 0. 048, PP: 0. 944 ± 0. 071).

40|$|Radon {{testing in}} the US has reached a plateau with about two dozen {{different}} types of instruments and methods being used to make about one million measurements per year. Knowledge of the sensitivity and accuracy of radon testing instruments can {{make it easier for}} testing firms and home inspectors to select the most appropriate device for their radon testing program. This paper compares the sensitivity and as a consequence the accuracy of every type of device that information was given by the manufacturer or cited from published literature. Some instrument manufacturers, did not make this information available. The sensitivity expressed in counts/minute per 4 pCi/L, was selected because most of the measurements for radon in the US are < 4 pCi/L. The instruments listed in this paper represent passive and continuous radon monitors such as scintillation cell, pulse and <b>current</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber,</b> solid-state alpha monitors and several diffusion barrier charcoal integrating collectors. For comparison, the sensitivity of one open face charcoal canister is also included. The sensitivity of alpha track detectors and electret ion chambers are also included in terms of number of tracks/cm 2 / 4 pCi/L- 1 D- 1 and Volts/ 4 pCi/L- 1 D- 1 The sensitivities of continuous radon monitors ranges from 0. 17 to 24 cpm/ 4 pCi L- 1 ranging from 0. 17 - 5. 7 cpm/ 4 pCi/L, in the instruments most frequently used. By comparison the sensitivities of diffusion barrier charcoal vials or canisters range from 48 - 145 cpm/ 4 pCi L- 1 At radon levels of < 4 pCi/L, most of the continuous radon monitors will provide poor results if counts are acquired at minute intervals. For this reason, EPA, requires continuous radon instruments to accumulate hourly counts to improve accuracy. ...|$|E

For uniform ionization rates, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the space charge perturbations depends only on the values of the electronic and ionic Langevin factors of the filling fluid. We show that the influence of space charges can be neglected when the Langevin factor, λ, is small. These results were confirmed using numerical resolutions of the charge propagation equations. Finally, we evaluate the voltage that delimits the transition between the recombination regime and the saturation plateau when the space charges are taken into account...|$|R

This homemade ion chamber was manufactured using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) coated with graphite, and co-axial cables. In order to evaluate the performance of this <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber,</b> some characterization tests were performed: short- and medium-term stability, leakage current, saturation, ion collection efficiency, polarity effect and linearity of response. The maximum value obtained in the short-term stability test was 0. 2 %, {{in accordance with the}} limit value of 0. 3 % provided by the IEC 60731 standard. The saturation curve was obtained varying the applied voltage from- 400 V to + 400 V, in steps of 50 V, using the charge collecting time of 20 s. From the saturation curve two other characteristics were analyzed: the polarity effect and the ion collection efficiency, with results within the international recommendations. The leakage <b>current</b> of the <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> was measured in time intervals of 20 minutes, before and after its irradiations, and all the results obtained were in agreement with the IEC 60731 standard.

The ion chamber like proportional tubes may improve the sensitivity and lower the cost of the ion chambers system. An amplify factor of 1, 000 to 10, 000 is introduced in the proportional area.

The density of these neutrons was determined experimentally by means of <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> filled with B^(10), B^(11) F_ 3, and argon. The ion- ization current resulting from the B^(10) (n,α) Li^ 7 reaction was obtained {{as a function of}} pressure altitude from 760 grams cm^(- 2) (8, 000 ft) to 6 grams cm^(- 2) (115, 000 ft) in a series of balloon flights at a geomagnetic latitude of 41 °N. By comparing the <b>current</b> from the <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> to the counting rate of a B^(10) F_ 3 proportional counter, when irradiating the instruments with a thermal neutron source, an absolute calibration of the <b>ionization</b> <b>current</b> in terms of thermal neutron density was made. The large volume of the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> (9 liters) resulted in a significant reduction of statistical errors relative to earlier balloon flights. The small size of the flight units (3 kilograms) avoided the problems associated with local neutron production and moderation which are present in airplane measurements. The data show a maximum in the neutron density of 4. 8 ± 1. 2 x 10 ^(- 7) neutrons cm^(- 3) at a pressure altitude of 100 g cm^ 2 (53, 000 ft), a rapid decline above this altitude, and an exponential decrease below 250 g cm^(- 2) with an absorption length of 165 ± 20 g cm^(- 2). If the data are extrapolated {{to the top of the}} atmosphere by the use of neutron transport theory, a value of 1. 6 ± 0. 8 x 10 ^(- 8) neutrons cm^(- 3) is obtained.

40|$|SolACES {{is part of}} the ESA SOLAR ISS {{mission that}} started aboard the shuttle mission STS- 122 on 7 February 2008. The {{instrument}} has recorded solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance from 16 to 150 nm during the extended solar activity minimum and the beginning solar cycle 24 with rising solar activity and increasingly changing spectral composition. The SOLAR mission has been extended from a period of 18 months to >[*] 8 years until the end of 2016. SolACES is operating three grazing incidence planar grating spectrometers and two three-current <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers.</b> The latter ones are considered as primary radiometric detector standards. Re-filling the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> with three different gases repeatedly and using overlapping band-pass filters, the absolute EUV fluxes are derived i n these spectral intervals. This way the serious problem of continuing efficiency changes in space-borne instrumentation is overcome during the mission. Evaluating the three <b>currents</b> of the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers,</b> the overlapping spectral ranges of the spectrometers and of the filters plus inter-comparing the results from the EUV photon absorption in the gases with different absorption cross sections, there are manifold instrumental possibilities to cross-check the results providing a high degree of reliability to the spectral irradiance derived. During the mission a very strong up-and-down variability of the spectrometric efficiency by orders of magnitude is observed. One of the effects involved is channeltron degradation. However, there are still open questions on other effects contributing to these changes. A survey of the measurements carried out and first results of the solar spectral irradiance (SSI) data are presented.

In the present investigation, the relative response of 17 cylindrical <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> was evaluated at three proton beam qualities: at two points in a modulated beam and one point in a non-modulated beam, all with an incident energy of 75 MeV. Thirteen of the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> had a Farmer-type geometry but consisted of different combinations of wall and central electrode materials. All <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> were calibrated in terms of air kerma as well as in terms of absorbed dose to water in a Co- 60 beam.
