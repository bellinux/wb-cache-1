40|$|In a {{previous}} report "Comparison of <b>Combustibility</b> <b>Test</b> Procedures" (1), results of tests were given on the combustibility of seven different building {{materials for the}} purpose of guiding the Canadian Standards Association Sub-committee on Noncombustibility in the preparation of a new specification for the combustibility rating of materials.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to compare the merits of the <b>combustibility</b> <b>test</b> procedure of the British Standards Institution with certain procedures suggested by the writer using a furnace essentially the same as the one described in a previous report. The results of further studies, together with recommendations on testing procedures and apparatus will be presented in subsequent reports. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Gmelina {{wood was}} pyrolysed in a bench scale screw {{pyrolysis}} reactor for bio-oil/bio-char production, at a reaction temperature of 454 Â°C. The bio-oil and bio-char product yields were 71 and 13 wt. %, respectively {{while the rest}} accounted for wt. % of non-condensable gas and minor losses as feedstock dust. The products were characterized for {{physical and chemical properties}} to determine their potentials for energy use and industrial process applications. The results show that the bio-oil produced contains the major organic compounds typical of bio-oil from other energy crops used for commercial bio-oil production. The bio-char possesses heating value typical of pulverized coal, hence, it can be used as supplement to coal to reduce coal consumption in thermal power plants. The <b>combustibility</b> <b>test</b> of the flue gas produced blue flame showing complete combustion in excess of oxygen. This correlates with result of analysis of the gas contents using gas analyzer and GC/MS showing the presence of flammable gases such as alkanes, alkenes, hydrogen etc. Similarly, it compares relatively well with the results obtained with other woody biomass pyrolyzed in fluidized bed reactors...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the A. S. T. M. <b>Combustibility</b> <b>Tests,</b> Project A- 9, {{performed}} by the Fire Research Station, Division of Building Research, National Research Council was {{to assist with the}} studies undertaken by Subcommittee V of A. S. T. M. Committee E- 5 concerning the definition of "combustibility". The definition and method of test apply to building materials initially in the solid state. They do not apply to finely divided solid materials. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Ethylene {{polymerization}} {{was done}} to form polyethylene nano-composite with nanoaluminum nitride using zirconocene catalysts. Results show that the catalytic activity is maximum at a filler loading of 15 [*]mg nanoaluminum nitride. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that percentage crystallinity was also marginally higher at this amount of filler. Thermal behavior of polyethylene nanocomposites (0, 15, 30, and 45) [*]mg was studied by DSC and thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA). Morphology of the component with 15 [*]mg aluminium nitride is more fibrous as compared to 0 [*]mg aluminium nitride and higher filler loading as shown by SEM images. In order to understand <b>combustibility</b> behavior, <b>tests</b> were performed on microcalorimeter. Its results showed decrease in combustibility in polyethylene nanocomposites as the filler loading increases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Using {{holographic}} interferometry as quantitative measuring and contactless {{diagnostic method}} in basic and application research considerably depends on process of evaluation of interferograms. In the paper a programme solution is presented which will simplify time and labour consuming evaluation of holograms, it will increase accuracy of calculating and exclude subjective influences in evaluation. The programme states the temperature fields in holograms achieved at experiments. The interferential fringes occurred above heated wood sample are matched with the temperatures, which are {{possible to be}} used for further processing, e. g. to calculate the coefficients of thermal conductivity. 1. Holographic interferograms. Study of many physical processes could be much easier if they are visualised. One of the possible applications of holographic interferometry [2, 7, 8] is visualisation of distribution of temperatures in <b>testing</b> <b>combustibility</b> of wood of different kinds of sample bodies in various anatomical directions, or different sample bodies. By evaluation of holographic interferogram we can receive the temperature profile above the examined sample, i. e. temperatures will be matche...|$|R
