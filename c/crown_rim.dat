40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} study {{of the impact of}} water drops on thin liquid films. The mor- phology of the impact was studied by still photography, and quantitative results were obtained by a proper image analysis technique. The time evolution of various param- eters like the crown diameter, the crown height, and the secondary drop diameters are reported, and these experi- mental parameters are correlated and compared to avail- able theoretical models. A particular set-up of the acquisition system allowed us to photograph the splash from below the solid wall, allowing the first estimation of the crown thickness and the total number of jets pro- truding from the <b>crown</b> <b>rim</b> as a function of time. The results indicate that, for the range of the parameters investigated, there is not a strong dependence on the film thickness. The evolution of the crown height depends on the impact Weber number, whereas its growing velocity and the crown thickness evolution are almost independent of Weber number...|$|E

The principles for the measurement of local strains with adapted strain gauges for large deformations and for the measurement of global tire deformations by spring loaded deflection transducers arranged between the fire <b>crown</b> and the <b>rim</b> are introduced.

This refinement al so takes the rim deformation into account. The parameter identification procedure for the large deformation extension is explained and validation results are shown. In combination with extended post-processing functionality, this model extension enables CDTire in misuse-like simulations...|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} located on the North American Plate, west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on a sea-mount of {{approximately}} 1.5-1.0 million years age. The islands of Corvo and Flores emerged from a submarine mount oriented along a north-northeast to south-southwest line, while Corvo is controlled by faults oriented north to south, parallel to the mid-Atlantic Ridge, and transform faults oriented west to east which crosscut secondary cones on the outer slopes. The island formed from a 5 km diameter central volcano (Monte Gorde) that emerged around 730,000 years ago, whose central cone was approximately 1000 meters ft in altitude. The crater collapsed 430,000 years ago during a Plinian eruption, forming a subsidence caldera (2000 m in diameter and 300 m depth), referred to as the Caldeirão. Within the caldera are several cinder and spatter cones (20 - 30 m in height) giving rise to small lakes, peat bogs, and islets (two long and five rounded). The highest point on the island, the Morro dos Homens, <b>crowns</b> the southern <b>rim</b> of the Caldeirão at 718 m above sea level.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new solver for massively {{parallel}} simulations of fully three-dimensional multiphase flows. The solver runs {{on a variety}} of computer architectures from laptops to supercomputers and on 65536 threads or more (limited only by the availability to us of more threads). The code is wholly written by the authors in Fortran 2003 and uses a domain decomposition strategy for parallelization with MPI. The fluid interface solver is based on a parallel implementation of the LCRM hybrid Front Tracking/Level Set method designed to handle highly deforming interfaces with complex topology changes. We discuss the implementation of this interface method and its particular suitability to distributed processing where all operations are carried out locally on distributed subdomains. We have developed parallel GMRES and Multigrid iterative solvers suited to the linear systems arising from the implicit solution of the fluid velocities and pressure in the presence of strong density and viscosity discontinuities across fluid phases. Particular attention is drawn to the details and performance of the parallel Multigrid solver. The code includes modules for flow interaction with immersed solid objects, contact line dynamics, species and thermal transport with phase change. Here, however, we focus on the simulation of the canonical problem of drop splash onto a liquid film and report on the parallel performance of the code on varying numbers of threads. The 3 D simulations were run on mesh resolutions up to $ 1024 ^ 3 $ with results at the higher resolutions showing the fine details and features of droplet ejection, <b>crown</b> formation and <b>rim</b> instability observed under similar experimental conditions.

With this test rig, new impulses could be derived for the modeling and for the parameter identification procedure.

60|$|This morning, when I {{looked into}} the room, there were one or two gentlemen and other respectable persons; but in the best place, close to the fire, and {{crouching}} almost into it, was an elderly beggar, with the raggedest of overcoats, two great rents in the shoulders of it disclosing the dingy lining, all bepatched with various stuff covered with dirt, and on his shoes and trousers the mud of an interminable pilgrimage. Owing to the posture in which he sat, I could not see his face, but only the battered <b>crown</b> and <b>rim</b> of the very shabbiest hat that ever was worn. Regardless {{of the presence of}} women (which, indeed, Englishmen seldom do regard when they wish to smoke), he was smoking a pipe of vile tobacco; but, after all, this was fortunate, because the man himself was not personally fragrant. He was terribly squalid,--terribly; and when I had a glimpse of his face, it well befitted the rest of his development,-- grizzled, wrinkled, weather-beaten, yet sallow, and down-looking, with a watchful kind of eye turning upon everybody and everything, meeting the glances of other people rather boldly, yet soon shrinking away; a long thin nose, a gray beard of a week's growth; hair not much mixed with gray, but rusty and lifeless;--a miserable object; but it was curious to see how he was not ashamed of himself, but seemed to feel {{that he was one of}} the estates of the kingdom, and had as much right to live as other men. He did just as he pleased, took the best place by the fire, nor would have cared though a nobleman were forced to stand aside for him. When the steamer's bell rang, he shouldered a large and heavy pack, like a pilgrim with his burden of sin, but certainly journeying to hell instead of heaven. On board he looked round for the best position, at first stationing himself near the boiler-pipe; but, finding the deck damp underfoot, he went to the cabin-door, and took his stand on the stairs, protected from the wind, but very incommodiously placed for those who wished to pass. All this was done without any bravado or forced impudence, but in the most quiet way, merely because he was seeking his own comfort, and considered that he had a right to seek it. It was an Englishman's spirit; but in our country, I imagine, a beggar considers himself a kind of outlaw, and would hardly assume the privileges of a man in any place of public resort. Here beggary is a system, and beggars are a numerous class, and make themselves, in a certain way, respected as such. Nobody evinced the slightest disapprobation of the man's proceedings. In America, I think, we should see many aristocratic airs on such provocation, and probably the ferry people would there have rudely thrust the beggar aside; giving him a shilling, however, which no Englishman would ever think of doing. There would also have been a great deal of fun made of his squalid and ragged figure; whereas nobody smiled at him this morning, nor in any way showed the slightest disrespect. This is good; but it is the result of a state of things by no means good. For many days there has been a great deal of fog on the river, and the boats have groped their way along, continually striking their bells, while, on all sides, there are responses of bell and gong; and the vessels at anchor look shadow-like as we glide past them, and the master of one steamer shouts a warning to the master of another which he meets. The Englishmen, who hate to run any risk without an equivalent object, show a good deal of caution and timidity on these foggy days.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} ten years, {{there has been a}} {{significant}} trend in automotive design using low aspect ratio tires and increasingly run-flat tires as well. In recent publications, the influence of those tire types on the dynamic loads – transferred from the road through the wheel into the car – have been examined pretty extensively, including comparative wheel force transducer measurements as well as computational results. It can be shown that the loads to the vehicle tend to increase when using low aspect ratio tires and particularly when using run-flat tires. These tires provide higher stiffnesses while simultaneously introducing larger nonlinearities in the sidewall behavior [1 – 3]. Depending on manufacturer and the combination of vehicle size and wheel properties, these deformations can be so large that the tire belt and/or sidewall have contact with the <b>rim</b> <b>crown</b> (protected by the tire sidewall). The full vehicle simulation on virtual proving grounds is well established and important for the vehicle product development process. One of the most important subsystems in the virtual load assessment process, using full vehicle simulation is the tire model. The precision of that is essential for the overall accuracy of the virtual method. So the tendencies described above strongly require adaptations and improvements in the field of tire modeling. In 2007, Fraunhofer LBF together with Honda R&D started to examine the influences of low aspect ratio and run flat tires for the accuracy of full vehicle simulation results for durability relevant scenarios [3 – 5]. Those activities were the starting point for a four years joint activity to extend the usability of the virtual load prediction method by full vehicle simulation to application for which strong nonlinearities in the tire (large very transient deformation), but also in the vehicle model itself occur. As a part of that joint development, this paper summarizes the activities of Fraunhofer LBF to develop a dedicated tire model, which can accurately handle very large deformations of the tire up to misuse-like applications. The model is based on the LBF tire model CDTire. In the first chapter several nonlinear extensions of the belt and sidewall model will be described which have been implemented to capture the large deformation behavior. These model extensions are also taking into account the belt-to-sidewall and sidewall-to-rim contact. To validate and to parameterize these model extensions, Fraunhofer LBF built a dedicated flat track test rig, which can be used to realize “roll-over-cleat” experiments using huge obstacles, so that belt-to-sidewall and sidewall-to-rim contact can be forced. This test rig will be described in chapter 2. The third chapter is dealing with the interface of the new tire model to a flexible rim. While the load transfer from road via tire into the vehicle is relatively easy to detect, for example by using wheel force transducers, the local forces acting on the rim flanges {{as well as on the}} wheel well (when e. g. passing a curb) are much more difficult to detect (in measurement as well as in simulation). LBF developed a method to detect local tire-to-rim interface forces and manage flexible rim simulation in Multi-Body-Simulation (LMS Virtual. Lab Motion – [6]). One key issue of the overall method is the capability of the tire model to predict local rim forces on the rim flanges in a suitable way. The second key issue is to combine the tire with a model of a flexible rim (which is embedded in a full vehicle MBS model). This method can be used to perform virtual load prediction of local, transient rim forces, which are the basis for CAE based fatigue life prediction of wheels applying typical durability test track and abuse load events...|$|R

In modern days, I doubt if any artist among us, except David Roberts, knows so much perspective as would enable him to draw a Gothic arch to scale, at a given angle and distance. Turner, though he was professor of perspective to the Royal Academy, did not know what he professed, and never, as far as I remember, drew a single building in true perspective in his life; he drew them only with as much perspective as suited him. Prout also knew nothing of perspective, and twisted his buildings, as Turner did, into whatever shapes he liked. I do not justify this; and would recommend the student at least to treat perspective with common civility, but to pay no court to it. The best way he can learn it, by himself, is by taking a pane of glass, fixed in a frame, {{so that it can be}} set upright before the eye, at the distance at which the proposed sketch is intended to be seen. Let the eye be placed at some fixed point, opposite the middle of the pane of glass, but as high or as low as the student likes; then with a brush at the end of a stick, and a little body-colour that will adhere to the glass, the lines of the landscape may be traced on the glass, as you see them through it. When so traced they are all in true perspective. If the glass be sloped in any direction, the lines are still in true perspective, only it is perspective calculated for a sloping plane, while common perspective always supposes the plane of the picture to be vertical. It is good, in early practice, to accustom yourself to enclose your subject, before sketching it, with a light frame of wood held upright before you; it will show you what you may legitimately take into your picture, and what choice there is between a narrow foreground near you, and a wide one farther off; also, what height of tree or building you can properly take in, &c.[198] ...|$|R
