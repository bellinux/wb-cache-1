A <b>capital</b> <b>employed</b> in trade, on the contrary, may be highly productive {{to the individual}}, and yet be almost totally unproductive to the society: {{and this is the}} reason why I should call manufacturing labour unproductive, in comparison of that which is employed in agriculture, and not for the reason given by the French economists. It is, indeed, almost impossible to see the great fortunes that are made in trade, and the liberality with which so many merchants live, and yet agree in the statement of the economists, that manufacturers can only grow rich by depriving themselves of the funds destined for their support. In many branches of trade the profits are so great as would allow of a clear rent to a third person; but as there is no third person in the case, and as all the profits centre in the master manufacturer, or merchant, he seems to have a fair chance of growing rich, without much privation; and we consequently see large fortunes acquired in trade by persons who have not been remarked for their parsimony.|$|E

60|$|The {{permanent}} {{values of}} all things which are neither under a natural nor under an artificial monopoly depend, as we have seen, on their cost of production. (1.) But the increasing power which mankind are constantly acquiring over nature increases more and more the efficiency of human exertion, or, in other words, diminishes cost of production. All inventions by which a greater quantity of any commodity can be produced with the same labor, or the same quantity with less labor, or which abridge the process, so that the <b>capital</b> <b>employed</b> needs not be advanced for so long a time, lessen the cost of production of the commodity. As, however, value is relative, if inventions and improvements in production were made in all commodities, and {{all in the same}} degree, there would be no alteration in values.|$|E
60|$|Nor is it {{possible}} that these rents should permanently remain as parts of the profits of stock, or of the wages of labour. If such an accumulation were to take place, as decidedly to lower the general profits of stock, and, consequently, the expenses of cultivation, so as to make it answer to cultivate poorer land; the cultivators of the richer land, if they paid no rent, would cease to be mere farmers, or persons living upon the profits of agricultural stock. They would unite the characters of farmers and landlords--a union by no means uncommon; but which does not alter, in any degree, the nature of rent, or its essential separation from profits. If the general profits of stock were 20 per cent and particular portions of land would yield 30 per cent on the <b>capital</b> <b>employed,</b> 10 per cent of the 30 would obviously be rent, by whomsoever received.|$|E
6000|$|But though {{cultivation}} {{cannot be}} extended, and the produce {{of the country}} increased, but {{in such a state}} of things as would allow of a rise of rents, yet it is of importance to remark, that this rise of rents will be by no means in proportion to the extension of cultivation, or the increase of produce. Every relative fall in the price of the instruments of production, may allow of the employment of a considerable quantity of additional capital; and when either new land is taken into cultivation, or the old improved, the increase of produce may be considerable, though the increase of rents be trifling. We see, in consequence, that in the progress of a country towards a high state of cultivation, the quantity of <b>capital</b> <b>employed</b> upon the land, and the quantity of produce yielded by it, bears a constantly increasing proportion to the amount of rents, unless counterbalanced by extraordinary improvements in the modes of cultivation.

40|$|Labour {{productivity}} {{in most of}} the EU countries grew much slower than in US over the last one and a half decades and the difference is attributed to the difference in the use of ICT. Analysing EU KLEMS database (capital (K), labour (L), energy (E), material (M) and service inputs (S)) and Eurostat database it is noted that the micro and small enterprises, numerically predominant in the EU countries, use much less amount of ICT. With very low proportion of enterprises with ICT installation, with less sophisticated technology and probably with the lowest amount of ICT <b>capital,</b> these enterprises <b>employ</b> relatively larger proportion of workers who use ICTs. The larger enterprises on the other hand with more sophisticated and larger quantity ICT <b>capital</b> <b>employ</b> fewer workers who handle this technology.

60|$|Or, lastly, {{instead of}} [capital] being afforded by persons not in business, the affording it may itself become a business.

Numerous fleets of large ships, loaded with the most valuable commodities of the East, annually arriving in England, in a constant and increasing succession, imposed upon the public eye, and naturally gave rise to an opinion of the happy condition and growing opulence of a country whose surplus productions occupied so vast a space in the commercial world.
