40|$|Discretization {{is used in}} click-based {{graphical}} passwords so {{that approximately}} <b>correct</b> <b>entries</b> can {{be accepted by the}} system. We show that the existing discretization scheme of Birget et al. (2006) allows for false accepts and false rejects because the tolerance region is not guaranteed to be centered on the original click-point, causing usability and security concerns. Using empirical data from a large user study, we show that this is a significant issue in practice. We then introduce Centered Discretization, a simpler discretization method that eliminates false accepts and false rejects. It also allows for smaller tolerance regions without impacting the usability of the system. ...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS IIIA) is a {{specific}} lysosomal storage disorder caused by an enzyme deficiency in sulphamidase, which {{is required for the}} degradation of heparan sulphate glycosaminoglycan (gag). This deficiency results in widespread gag storage and leads to severe CNS degeneration and mild somatic pathology. We have developed substrate deprivation as a therapy (SDT) for MPS disorders to reduce the initial production of gag substrate for the deficient enzyme, using the compound rhodamine B as an inhibitor of gag biosynthesis. This should restore the balance between gag level and residual enzyme activity towards normal and improve patient outcome. To determine if SDT improved CNS function, MPS IIIA mice were treated for 6 months with weekly, intravenous 1 mg/kg rhodamine B and then tested in a 4 -arm water cross maze, which measures spatial learning and memory. MPS IIIA untreated mice were unable to perform to the same level as normal littermates, having increased escape latency, increased incorrect <b>entries</b> and decreased <b>correct</b> <b>entries.</b> Rhodamine B treatment improved MPS IIIA performance towards normal with treated mice having decreased escape latency, decreased incorrect <b>entries</b> and increased <b>correct</b> <b>entries</b> when compared to MPS IIIA untreated littermates. This provides the first report of SDT resulting in a beneficial effect on CNS function in an MPS disorder and SDT targeting gag synthesis may be a viable treatment option for children with MPS.

40|$|Model {{independent}} {{tests for}} symmetry violations in tau decays {{are important for}} determining whether the tau lepton is elementary or, instead, macroscopic. Such tests are also significant steps towards resolving the outstanding "e - mu - tau" puzzle. This talk reviews such tests {{in the context of}} a general treatment of two-body tau decays which only assumes Lorentz invariance and the tree-like structure of the tau-antitau production-decay sequence. Direct measurement of polarized-partial-widths and of associated ``longitudinal-transverse W-exchange" interference intensities will provide significant probes for distinguishing elementary/macroscopic theories of the Higgs and of the tau, and tau-neutrino. The analogous goals and techniques apply to top quark decays. Comment: Replacement to <b>correct</b> <b>entries</b> in Table...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A high-dimensional {{database}} {{system is}} studied where the noisy {{versions of the}} underlying feature vectors are observed in both the enrollment and the query phases. The noisy observations are compressed before being stored in the database, and the user wishes to both identify the <b>correct</b> <b>entry</b> corresponding to the noisy query vector and reconstruct the original feature vector within a desired distortion level. A fundamental capacity-storage-distortion tradeoff is identified for this system {{in the form of}} single-letter information theoretic expressions.

Samuel Lewis' A Topological Dictionary of England, written 1848, posits a different contender as the true Ireleth. He claimed Ouregrave referred to the village because of the existence of a mill named Orga-Mill, but he conceded this was also conjecture. Lewis' full text on Ireleth is below.|$|R
