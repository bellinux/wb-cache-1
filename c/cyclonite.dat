2500|$|RDX is also known, {{but less}} commonly, as <b>cyclonite,</b> hexogen (particularly in Russian, French, German and German-influenced languages), T4 and {{chemically}} as cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine. In the 1930s, the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, started investigating <b>cyclonite</b> to use against German U-boats {{that were being}} built with thicker hulls. The goal was an explosive more energetic than TNT. For security reasons, Britain termed <b>cyclonite</b> as [...] "Research Department Explosive" [...] (R.D.X.). The term RDX appeared in the United States in 1946. The first public reference in the United Kingdom to the name RDX, or R.D.X. to use the official title, appeared in 1948; its authors were the Managing Chemist, ROF Bridgwater, the Chemical Research and Development Department, Woolwich, and the Director of Royal Ordnance Factories, Explosives; again, it {{was referred to as}} simply RDX.|$|E

Major accomplishments of this period included better methods for storing smokeless powder, improved processing of <b>cyclonite</b> (more commonly called RDX), and {{the discovery of a}} new explosive, then known as haleite but later known as Ednatol. (The discoverer was George C. Hale, the arsenal's chief chemist.) ...|$|E
50|$|For optimal penetration, a high {{explosive}} {{with a high}} detonation velocity and pressure is normally chosen. The most common explosive used in high performance anti-armor warheads is HMX (octogen), although never in its pure form, {{as it would be}} too sensitive. It is normally compounded with a few percent of some type of plastic binder, such as in the polymer-bonded explosive (PBX) LX-14, or with another less-sensitive explosive, such as TNT, with which it forms Octol. Other common high-performance explosives are RDX-based compositions, again either as PBXs or mixtures with TNT (to form Composition B and the Cyclotols) or wax (<b>Cyclonites).</b> Some explosives incorporate powdered aluminum to increase their blast and detonation temperature, but this addition generally results in decreased performance of the shaped charge. There has been research into using the very high-performance but sensitive explosive CL-20 in shaped-charge warheads, but, at present, due to its sensitivity, this has been {{in the form of the}} PBX composite LX-19 (CL-20 and Estane binder).|$|R
50|$|John Sheehan {{attended}} Catholic grade schools, {{even though}} John {{and his brother}} Joseph were not particularly religious later in life. He studied chemistry and political science at Battle Creek College. In 1937, Sheehan graduated as the valedictorian of his class and won a scholarship for graduate studies in any subject of his choice. He decided to study organic chemistry at the University of Michigan, receiving his Master's in 1938 and his PhD in 1941. His doctorate advisor, Werner E. Bachmann, {{was involved in the}} synthesis of steroid hormones. As a post-doctoral fellow, Sheehan collaborated with Bachmann on the commercially feasible production of RDX also known as <b>cyclonite,</b> which turned out to give the Allies a huge advantage at sea during World War II.|$|E
5000|$|The FBI team {{is set up}} {{to arrest}} Conrad when Beckett gets yet another call from their perpetrator. Through a window, she sees him {{with a gun in}} his left hand and a {{cellphone}} in his right. He disappears from view and a gunshot is heard. The formaldehyde that Conrad had stolen was being used to make <b>cyclonite,</b> a highly explosive element, that only 5 little pieces of could blow the whole precinct up. With that, they found a recording of the killer's voice, repeating, over and over, the words [...] "Goodbye, Nikki.". This recording was meant to activate about 5-10 seconds before a bomb would explode and kill detective Beckett. Back at his house, Castle looks over the crime scene pictures. He suddenly realizes that, in the pictures, Conrad's gun was in his right hand. However, the man in the window was left handed. Conrad was killed by the guy in the window and the real killer is still on the loose, causing him to realize that Beckett is still in danger. Castle leaves his house and calls Beckett to warn her, but she is in the shower. When she finally answers, Castle is seen running towards her apartment and tells her that Conrad isn't the killer [...] While on the phone, Castle hears the [...] "Goodbye, Nikki" [...] recording, seconds before arriving at her building and then her apartment blows up with Castle right outside. He takes cover from the blast and exploding glass, looking up in horror to see Beckett's apartment on fire.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{carries out}} a Monte Carlo {{simulation}} of a landmine detection system, using the MCNP 5 code, {{for the detection}} of concealed explosives such as trinitrotoluene and <b>cyclonite.</b> In portable field detectors, the signal strength of backscattered neutrons and gamma rays from thermal neutron activation is sensitive to a number of parameters such as the mass of explosive, depth of concealment, neutron moderation, background soil composition, soil porosity, soil moisture, multiple scattering in the background material, and configuration of the detection system. In this work, a detection system, with BF 3 detectors for neutrons and sodium iodide scintillator for g-rays, is modeled to investigate the neutron signal-to-noise ratio and to obtain an empirical formula for the photon production rate Ri(n,Î³) = SfGfMf(d,m) from radiative capture reactions in constituent nuclides of trinitrotoluene. This formula can be used for the efficient landmine detection of explosives in quantities as small as ~ 200 g of trinitrotoluene concealed at depths down to about 15 cm. The empirical formula can be embedded in a field programmable gate array on a field-portable explosives' sensor for efficient online detection...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of explosive substances {{is a subject}} of high importance in several areas including environmental health, de-mining efforts (land and sea) and security and defence against terrorist activity. The use of electrochemical methods for the {{detection of}} these substances has increased in recent years but still is quite restricted to the most common explosives. The electrochemical detection of explosive nitroamines and taggant substances in solution using a virtual sensor array of metal-doped screen printed electrodes and differential pulse voltammetry was achieved. The multiple sets of voltammetric data from the different electrodic systems using Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) were integrated using multivariate analysis (PCA, NIPALS and LDA) and matched with known substances present in explosives. These combinations created a mathematical array which separated the explosives, even if the electrochemical information is buried or mixed with the background noise. Two explosive substances: octogen (HMX- 1, 3, 5 -Trinitroperhydro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine) and <b>cyclonite</b> (RDX- Hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine) and a taggant agent 2, 3 -dimethyl- 2, 3 -dinitrobutane (DMNB) were subjected to electrochemical analysis using a solid carbon- based screen printed electrode modified with silver, gold and platinum in aqueous solutions.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{explosives}} detection there is currently {{a need for a}} calibrated source of explosives vapor. Such a source could be used to test and calibrate explosives detection systems which identify explosives via the collection of vapor or air borne particulate matter. This paper describes the principles of operation and evaluation of one such explosives vapor generator. This generator is based on the diffusion of vapor from a condensed phase (i. e., solid or liquid) in a source reservoir, and the output has been tied to a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mass standard. We discuss results of the calibration of this generator using the explosives 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and <b>cyclonite</b> (RDX). The mass output of this generator is stable over hundreds of hours of continuous operation, and is adjustable from the low picograms(pg) /sec range to at least 10 nanograms(ng) /sec. In the case of TNT, the mass output correlates well with predictions based on gas phase diffusion theory. In the case of RDX, the agreement with theory is less good. This may be attributable to a variety of factors, possibly including inaccuracies in the published data on RDX vapor pressure as a function of temperature...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: Fast {{methods that}} allow the in situ {{analysis}} of explosives {{from a variety of}} surfaces are needed in crime scene investigations and home-land security. Here, the feasibility of the ambient mass spectrometry technique desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization (DAPPI) in the analysis of the most common nitrogen-based explosives is studied. METHODS: DAPPI and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) were compared in the direct analysis of trinitrotoluene (TNT), trinitrophenol (picric acid), octogen (HMX), <b>cyclonite</b> (RDX), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), and nitroglycerin (NG). The effect of different additives in DAPPI dopant and in DESI spray solvent on the ionization efficiency was tested, as well as the suitability of DAPPI to detect explosives from a variety of surfaces. RESULTS: The analytes showed ions only in negative ion mode. With negative DAPPI, TNT and picric acid formed deprotonated molecules with all dopant systems, while RDX, HMX, PETN and NG were ionized by adduct formation. The formation of adducts was enhanced by addition of chloroform, formic acid, acetic acid or nitric acid to the DAPPI dopant. DAPPI was more sensitive than DESI for TNT, while DESI was more sensitive for HMX and picric acid. CONCLUSIONS: DAPPI could become an important method for the direct analysis of nitroaromatics from a variety of surfaces. For compounds that are thermally labile, or that have very low vapor pressure, however, DESI is better suited. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the most}} {{economical}} method for disposing of unwanted energetic high explosives [HEs; e. g., 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro-triazine (RDX, {{also known as}} <b>Cyclonite),</b> and octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetrazocine (HMX, also known as Octogen) ] involves open burning and open or underground detonation [OB/O(U) D]; federal, state, and even local government agencies in the United States (U. S.) are implementing stricter environmental regulations that eventually may prevent such activities. These stricter regulations will promote alternative technologies {{that are designed to}} be environmentally benign. However, past HE-waste disposal practices at manufacturing and fabrication facilities in the U. S. have included uncontrolled OB/O(U) D, as well as direct surface discharge of HE-contaminated waste water, resulting in contaminated environmental media (e. g., ground water, soil, and perhaps even edible vegetation) near residential areas. Using TNT, RDX, and HMX as examples, this paper describes how risk-based standards for HEs can be derived that account for potential multimedia exposures (associated with contaminated air, water, food, and soil) by individuals near a contaminated site, and used to (1) protect public health and safety; (2) prevent limited resources from being dedicated to unnecessary cleanup activities; and (3) identify the most cost-effective, practical, and environmentally benign technologies suitable for integrating with the handling of the large quantity of high explosives scheduled for demilitarization...|$|E
40|$|Continuing use of {{explosives}} by terrorists {{throughout the world}} has led to great interest in explosives detection technology, especially in technologies that have potential for standoff detection. This LDRD was undertaken in order to investigate the possible detection of explosive particulates at safe standoff distances {{in an attempt to}} identify vehicles that might contain large vehicle bombs (LVBs). The explosives investigated have included the common homogeneous or molecular explosives, 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT), pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), <b>cyclonite</b> or hexogen (RDX), octogen (HMX), and the heterogeneous explosive, ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (ANFO), and its components. We have investigated standard excited/dispersed fluorescence, laser-excited prompt and delayed dispersed fluorescence using excitation wavelengths of 266 and 355 nm, the effects of polarization of the laser excitation light, and fluorescence imaging microscopy using 365 - and 470 -nm excitation. The four nitro-based, homogeneous explosives (TNT, PETN, RDX, and HMX) exhibit virtually no native fluorescence, but do exhibit quenching effects of varying magnitude when adsorbed on fluorescing surfaces. Ammonium nitrate and fuel oil mixtures fluoresce primarily due to the fuel oil, and, in some cases, due to the presence of hydrophobic coatings on ammonium nitrate prill or impurities in the ammonium nitrate itself. Pure ammonium nitrate shows no detectable fluorescence. These results are of scientific interest, but they provide little hope for the use of UV-excited fluorescence as a technique to perform safe standoff detection of adsorbed explosive particulates under real-world conditions with a useful degree of reliability...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringWilliam L. DunnThis report {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of a standoff interrogation method to identify nitrogen-rich explosive samples shielded by other materials (âclutterâ) using neutron beams from Cf- 252 and deuterium-tritium (D-T) generator sources. Neutrons from the beams interact with materials in the target to produce inelastic-scatter gamma rays, and, after slowing down to thermal energies, prompt-capture gamma rays. By detection of these gamma rays, a response vector is formed {{that is used to}} calculate a figure-of-merit, whose value is dependent upon the contents of the target. Various target configurations, which include an inert-material shield and a sample {{that may or may not}} be explosive, were simulated using the MCNP 5 code. Both shielding and collimation of 14. 1 -MeV neutron beams were simulated to produce effective neutron beams for target interrogation purposes and to minimize dose levels. Templates corresponding to particular target scenarios were generated, and their effectiveness at nitrogen-rich explosive identification was explored. Furthermore, methods were proposed yielding more effective templates including grouping target responses by density and composition. The results indicate that neutron-based interrogation has potential to detect shielded nitrogen-rich explosives. The research found that using a tiered filter approach, in which a sample must satisfy several template requirements, achieved the best results for identifying the explosive <b>cyclonite</b> (RDX). A study in which a 14. 1 -MeV neutron beam irradiated a target containing a shielded sample, which could either be explosive (RDX) or inert, yielded no false negatives and only 2 false positives over a large parameter space of clutter-sample combination...|$|E

The electrochemical {{detection of}} explosives and related compounds in solution using a virtual metal electrode array and differential pulse voltammetry was achieved.

Seven explosive substances: 2, 4 -initrotoluene, 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene, 3, 4 -dinitrotoluene, 2 -nitrotoluene, octogen (HMX), pentaerithrytol tetranitrate (PETN), trinitrotoluene (TNT) and <b>cyclonite</b> (RDX) and a taggant agent 2, 3 ÃÂ¢Ã¢ï¿½Â¬ dimethylÃÂ¢Ã¢ï¿½Â¬ 2, 3 ÃÂ¢Ã¢ï¿½Â¬ dinitrobutane (DMNB) were subjected to analysis using four solid electrodes, namely glassy carbon, silver, gold and platinum in saline aqueous solutions to mimic an aquatic environment. The results obtained in Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) from the different experiments with each electrode were combined to produce a single voltammogram, which was subjected to chemometric analysis using Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Principle Component Analysis Non-Iterative Partial Least Squares (PCA-NIPALS). A combination of the electrochemical signals obtained together {{with the use of}} chemometric analysis made it possible to discriminate between explosives and their mixtures and also to quantitate their concentration in saline solutions. These combinations created a mathematical array, which clearly separates the explosives, even if the electrochemical information is buried or mixed with the electrode background noise.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringWilliam L. DunnThe signature-based {{radiation}} scanning (SBRS) technique {{can be used}} {{to rapidly}} detect nitrogen-rich explosives at standoff distances. This technique uses a template-matching procedure that produces a figure-of-merit (FOM) whose value is used to distinguish between inert and explosive materials. The present study develops a tiered-filter implementation of the signature-based radiation scanning technique, which reduces the number of templates needed. This approach starts by calculating a normalized FOM between signatures from an unknown target and an explosive template through stages or tiers (nitrogen first, then oxygen, then carbon, and finally hydrogen). If the normalized FOM is greater than a specified cut-off value for any of the tiers, the target signatures are considered not to match that specific template and the process is repeated for the next explosive template until all of the relevant templates have been considered. If a targetâs signatures match all the tiers of a single template, then the target is assumed to contain an explosive. The tiered filter approach uses eight elements to construct artificial explosive-templates that have the function of representing explosives cluttered with real materials. The feasibility of the artificial template approach to systematically build a library of templates that successfully differentiates explosive targets from inert ones in the presence of clutter and under different geometric configurations was explored. In total, 10 different geometric configurations were simulated and analyzed using the MCNP 5 code. For each configuration, 51 different inert materials were used as inert samples and as clutter in front of the explosive <b>cyclonite</b> (RDX). The geometric configurations consisted of different explosive volumes, clutter thicknesses, and distances of the clutter from the neutron source. Additionally, an objective function was developed to optimize the parameters that maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the method...|$|E
