40|$|Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) deficiency may cause functional instability {{of the knee}} (noncopers), while other patients compensate and perform {{at the same level}} as before injury (<b>copers).</b> This pilot study investigated whether there is a compensatory electromyographic (EMG) activity of the hamstrings in <b>copers,</b> noncopers and control patients. Ten patients with an ACL deficiency were equally divided into two groups of <b>copers</b> and noncopers. All patients underwent gait analysis with EMG of six muscles around the knee. Ten healthy young men formed the control group. In contrast to noncopers, <b>copers</b> showed an atypical semitendinosus activity during stance phase; the corresponding trend was found in biceps femoris activity. There was no difference between <b>copers</b> and controls in knee extension during stance phase. The noncopers had less knee extension.

40|$|International audienceUsing cluster {{analytical}} procedure, {{this study}} aimed (i) {{to determine whether}} people could be differentiated {{on the basis of}} coping profiles (or unique combinations of coping strategies); and (ii) to examine the relationships between these profiles and perceived stress and health-related behaviors. A sample of 578 French students (345 females, 233 males; M age ¼ 21. 78, SD age ¼ 2. 21) completed the Perceived Stress Scale- 14 (Bruchon-Schweitzer, 2002), the Brief COPE (Muller and Spitz, 2003) and a series of items measuring health-related behaviors. A two-phased cluster analytic procedure (i. e. hierarchical and non-hierarchical-k-means) was employed to derive clusters of coping strategy profiles. The results yielded four distinctive coping profiles: High <b>Copers,</b> Adaptive <b>Copers,</b> Avoidant <b>Copers</b> and Low <b>Copers.</b> The results showed that clusters differed significantly in perceived stress and health-related behaviors. High <b>Copers</b> and Avoidant <b>Copers</b> displayed higher levels of perceived stress and engaged more in unhealthy behavior, compared with Adaptive <b>Copers</b> and Low <b>Copers</b> who reported lower levels of stress and engaged more in healthy behaviors. These findings suggested that individuals' relative reliance on some strategies and de-emphasis on others may be a more advantageous way of understanding the manner in which individuals cope with stress. Therefore, cluster analysis approach may provide an advantage over more traditional statistical techniques by identifying distinct coping profiles that might best benefit from interventions. Future research should consider coping profiles to provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} relationships between coping strategies and health outcomes and to identify risk groups...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Fifty-six {{women with}} stage II breast cancer eceiving {{adjuvant}} chemotherapy were recruited {{for a study}} evaluating and comparing coping patterns for differences in physical and psychological side effects during treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy. Cluster analyses were used to split women into confrontive, avoidant-confrontive, avoidant-resigned, and resigned coping clusters. Side-effect measure-ments were taken {{on the day of}} adjuvant chemotherapy infusion and 3 and 7 days later. Repeated mea-sures ANCOVAs indicated that coping clusters predicted significant variance in physical, psychological, and total side effects when variance in covariates was held constant. Confrontive subjects reported sig-nificantly fewer psychological nd physical symptoms than avoidant-confrontive and avoidant-resigned <b>copers.</b> Confrontive <b>copers</b> also reported fewer side effects than resigned <b>copers,</b> but this difference was not significant when differences incovariate distributions were controlled. Particularly robust differences were noted when confrontive <b>copers</b> were compared with avoidant-confrontive <b>copers.</b> Results suggest that a critical component in optimal coping may be a willingness to discuss and think about illness...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} adapt to stress and life {{difficulties}} is a vital aspect of human development and functioning. Coping {{is one of the}} crucial constructs that influences this adjustment process. Accordingly, this study draws from interpersonal acceptance-rejection theory’s (IPARTheory) coping subtheory, which recognizes that the psychological adjustment of some individuals who experience themselves to be seriously rejected by attachment figures is not as seriously impaired as it is for the majority of individuals who experience serious rejection. These people are called affective <b>copers.</b> This dissertation focused primarily on seven research questions dealing with affective <b>copers.</b> Secondarily, for comparison purposes, the same analyses were conducted for non-copers. Data from the Rohner Center for the Study of Interpersonal Acceptance and Rejection were used in this study. Results showed that (1) there were 2, 016 (16. 88 %) rejected individuals in a total sample of 11, 946 adults. (2) Eight hundred eleven (6. 79 %) of the adults in the total sample were affective copers; 40. 2 % of all adults who felt rejected as children were also affective <b>copers.</b> (3 a) Age had a significant negative but marginal correlation with coping. (3 b) There were significantly more female <b>copers</b> than male <b>copers</b> in the sample. (4) Both male and female <b>copers</b> remembered having experienced significantly more maternal acceptance than paternal acceptance in childhood. (5) Male copers’ psychological adjustment correlated significantly with remembrances of maternal acceptance in childhood, and with age. Female copers’ psychological adjustment was significantly associated with parental acceptance and age. (6) For male <b>copers,</b> both maternal acceptance and paternal acceptance were unique and significant predictors of psychological adjustment. For female <b>copers,</b> age and an interaction between maternal and paternal acceptance were significant predictors of psychological adjustment. Finally, (7) there was no mediation effect of partner acceptance on the relationship between parental acceptance and the psychological adjustment of <b>copers.</b> This research has implications for clinical researchers and practitioners. Results of this study provide empirical information regarding variables and factors‒‒including moderators and mediators‒‒that are associated with coping and resilience of seriously rejected adults...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 43 - 50) The {{issue of}} how to effectively deal with stress in our everyday lives is one that plagues every individual. The investigation conducted examined how individuals cope with life stresses. The purpose of the investigation {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of various ways of coping upon one???s overall adjustment, and to see if one particular method of coping was more adaptive than others. The general hypothesis being investigated was that people who cope with stress through physical activity would display more coping skills and a better overall adjustment than people who cope with stress through other means. Adjustment was defined according to scores on the six tests administered (the Beck Depression Inventory, the Janis-Fields Feelings of Inadequacy Scale, Rotter???s Internal-External Locus of Control Scale, the Ways of Coping Checklist, the Hassles Scale, and the Uplifts Scale). Two hundred and twenty-eight participants were grouped as follows. Physical <b>Copers</b> (individuals using physical activity to cope) consisted of 78 participants. Cognitive <b>Copers</b> (individuals using cognitive activities to cope) consisted of 66 participants. Miscellaneous <b>Copers</b> (individuals using other means of coping than physical or cognitive) consisted of 84 participants. Results of the 2 x 3 between-subjects multivariate analysis of variance offered some support of the following hypotheses. Physical <b>Copers</b> reported significantly more coping mechanisms than did Cognitive <b>Copers.</b> There was no significant difference, however, between Physical <b>Copers</b> and Miscellaneous <b>Copers</b> with respect to reported numbers of coping mechanisms. Secondly, the use of physical activity to cope appeared to aid as well in the relief of depression as did cognitively oriented activities, and appeared to be more effective than such activities as sleeping or eating. Other hypotheses were not confirmed, and no significant sex differences were found for any of the six measures used. Issues in stress research were discussed and directions for future research were mentioned...|$|R
40|$|There {{is limited}} {{scientific}} knowledge on ACL injuries in children 12 years or younger. Substantial controversy exists on treatment algorithms {{and there are}} no published data on performance based functional outcome. Classification of adult ACL injured subjects as <b>copers</b> and non-copers is common, but no study has classified knee function in children using performance based functional test after ACL injury. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the long term functional outcome among children with ACL injury, and to classify them as <b>copers</b> and non-copers. Children 12 years or younger who were referred to our institution from 1996 to 2004 with an ACL injury were included. Twenty non-operated subjects (21 knees) and six ACL reconstructed subjects (7 knees) were examined at a minimum of two years after ACL injury or reconstruction. Four single legged hop tests, isokinetic muscle strength measurements, and three functional questionnaires (IKDC 2000, KOS-ADLS and Lysholm) were used as outcome measurements. Children who had resumed their pre-injury activity level and performed above 90 % on all hop tests were classified as <b>copers</b> following non-operative treatment and ACL reconstruction. The 26 children were on average 10. 1 years at time of injury. Sixty-five percent of the nonoperated children had returned to pre-injury activity level, and 50 % were classified as <b>copers.</b> <b>Copers</b> scored significantly better than non-copers on single hop for distance, IKDC 2000, and Lysholm score. Nine and a half percent of the non-operated children had suffered a secondary meniscus injury. Sixty-seven percent of the ACL reconstructed subjects were classified as <b>copers</b> at follow-up. Non-operated ACL-deficient children demonstrated excellent knee function on performance based single legged hop tests and 65 % had returned to pre-injury activity level. Delayed ACL reconstruction resulted in success for a majority of the ACL reconstructed children. Treatment algorithms for ACL injured children are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a {{stressful}} environment for families of critically ill patients and {{these individuals are}} at risk to develop persistent psychological morbidity. Our study objective was to identify individual differences in coping with stress and information presentation preferences of respondents exposed to a simulated ICU experience. Participants were recruited from a university and two community populations. Participants completed questionnaires that measured demographic information and characteristics that may be relevant to an individual's ICU experience. Quality of life {{was measured by the}} EQ- 5 D, personality dimensions were examined with the abbreviated Big Five inventory, coping with stress was assessed with Brief COPE. Shared decision making preferences were assessed by the Degner Control Preferences Scale (CPS) and information seeking style was assessed with the Miller Behavioral Style Scale (MBSS). Social support was examined using an abbreviated version of the Social Relationship Index. Participants also completed a vignette-based simulated ICU experience, in which they made a surrogate decision on behalf of a loved one in the ICU. Three hundred forty-three participants completed the study. Three distinct coping profiles were identified: adaptive <b>copers,</b> maladaptive <b>copers,</b> and disengaged <b>copers.</b> Profiles differed primarily on coping styles, personality, quality of their closest social relationship, and history of anxiety and depression. Responses to the simulated ICU decision making experience differed across profiles. Disengaged <b>copers</b> (15 %) were more likely to elect to refuse dialysis on behalf of an adult sibling compared to adaptive <b>copers</b> (7 %) or maladaptive <b>copers</b> (5 %) (p = 0. 03). Notably, the MBSS and the CPS did not differ by coping profile. Distinct coping profiles are associated with differences in responses to a simulated ICU experience. Tailoring communication and support to specific coping profiles may represent an important pathway to improving ICU experience for patients and families...|$|R

40|$|Context: Why some {{individuals}} with ankle sprains develop functional ankle instability {{and others do}} not (ie, <b>copers)</b> is unknown. Current understanding of the clinical profile of <b>copers</b> is limited. Objective: To contrast individuals with functional ankle instability (FAI), <b>copers,</b> and uninjured individuals on both self-reported variables and clinical examination findings. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Sports medicine research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Participants consisted of 23 individuals {{with a history of}} 1 or more ankle sprains and at least 2 episodes of giving way in the past year (FAI: Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool [CAIT] score = 20. 52 ± 2. 94, episodes of giving way = 5. 8 ± 8. 4 per month), 23 individuals with a history of a single ankle sprain and no subsequent episodes of instability (copers: CAIT score = 27. 74 ± 1. 69), and 23 individuals with no history of ankle sprain and no instability (uninjured: CAIT score = 28. 78 ± 1. 78). Intervention(s) : Self-reported disability was recorded using the CAIT and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure for Activities of Daily Living and for Sports. On clinical examination, ligamentous laxity and tenderness, range of motion (ROM), and pain at end ROM were recorded. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Questionnaire scores for the CAIT, Foot and Ankle Ability Measure for Activities of Daily Living and for Sports, ankle inversion and anterior drawer laxity scores, pain with palpation of the lateral ligaments, ankle ROM, and pain at end ROM. Results: Individuals with FAI had greater self-reported disability for all measures (P 3 ̆c. 05). On clinical examination, individuals with FAI {{were more likely to have}} greater talar tilt laxity, pain with inversion, and limited sagittal-plane ROM than <b>copers</b> (P 3 ̆c. 05). Conclusions: Differences in both self-reported disability and clinical examination variables distinguished individuals with FAI from <b>copers</b> at least 1 year after injury. Whether the deficits could be detected immediately postinjury to prospectively identify potential <b>copers</b> is unknown...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{locomotive}} biomechanics of participants with chronic ankle instability (CAI) {{to those of}} lateral ankle sprain (LAS) <b>copers.</b> Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Twenty-eight participants with CAI and 42 LAS <b>copers</b> each performed 5 self-selected paced gait trials. 3 -D lower extremity temporal kinematic and kinetic data were collected for these participants from 200 ms pre- to 200 ms post-heel strike (period 1) and from 200 ms pre- to 200 ms post-toe off (period 2). Results: The CAI group displayed increased hip flexion bilaterally during period 1 compared to LAS <b>copers.</b> During period 2, CAI participants exhibited reduced hip extension bilaterally, increased knee flexion bilaterally and increased ankle inversion on the ‘involved’ limb. They also displayed a bilateral decrease in the flexor moment pattern at the knee. Conclusions: Considering {{that all of the}} features which distinguished CAI participants from LAS <b>copers</b> were also evident in our previously published research (within 2 -weeks following acute first-time LAS); these findings establish a potential link between these features and long-term outcome following first-time LAS. Clinicians must be cognizant of the capacity for these movement and motor control impairments to cascade proximally from the injured joint up the kinetic chain and recognise the value that gait re-training may have in rehabilitation planning to prevent CAI...|$|R
