A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra is a relatively common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish receptacle (<b>compared</b> <b>with</b> pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E

Such high interest rates, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> 5.0% GDP growth.
