5|$|The Su-25 {{often has}} radios {{installed}} for air-to-ground and air-to-air communications, including an SO-69 identification-friend-or-foe (IFF) transponder. The aircraft's self-defence suite includes various measures, such as flare and <b>chaff</b> dispensers capable of launching up to 250 flares and dipole <b>chaff.</b> Hostile radar uses are guarded against via an SPO-15 radar warning receiver.|$|E
5|$|The other {{countermeasures}} {{the ships}} use are four Sippican SRBOC (super rapid bloom off-board <b>chaff)</b> six-barrel MK36 decoy launchers, which deploy infrared Flare (countermeasure) and <b>chaff</b> {{to disrupt the}} sensors of incoming missiles; an SSTDS torpedo defense system; and an AN/SLQ-25 Nixie torpedo countermeasures system. The carriers also use AN/SLQ-32(V) Radar jamming and deception systems to detect and disrupt hostile radar signals {{in addition to the}} electronic warfare capabilities of some of the aircraft on board.|$|E
5|$|Glimmer and Taxable {{were very}} similar operations. They were {{executed}} {{in the early hours}} of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. Taxable simulated an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping <b>chaff</b> in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were able to create the illusion of a large fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the <b>chaff,</b> small boats towed radar reflector balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected of a large fleet. Once German forces were drawn to the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain them in this region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.|$|E

And so our reverence is for our dead. We do not forget them; but our duty is toward the living; and if we can be cheerful, cheerful in spirit, cheerful in speech and in hope, that is a benefit to those who are around us.|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} the {{anaerobic}} digestion of maize wastes that are being indiscriminately dumped on Nigerian urban streets was undertaken. Maize <b>chaffs,</b> stalks and cobs were shredded and mixed in water to waste ratios ranging from 3 : 1 to 4 : 1 (water to wastes) and anaerobically digested in three separate 0. 1 m 3 digesters for 30 days. Some physco-chemical and microbiological analyses of the digesting substrates were carried out during the 30 days retention period to evaluate the progress of digestion. Results obtained show that even though maize <b>chaffs,</b> stalks and cobs {{have the potential to}} generate biogas, the <b>chaffs</b> produced more biogas than the other two wastes. It was also observed that the <b>chaffs</b> generated more methane gas than the other two and was the earliest to flame when tested...|$|R

5|$|The AM-1Q was {{developed}} for electronic countermeasures (ECM) duties. The fuselage fuel tank was removed {{to make room for}} the ECM operator and his equipment in a windowless compartment. The aircraft carried several radio and radar receivers, transmitters and a signal analyzer. The operator could also drop bundles of <b>chaff</b> through a chute to block radar signals.|$|E
5|$|Gun {{armament}} of {{the class}} consists of two Bofors /70 Mk1 gun mounted on the bow and towards the stern. During the development phase, the designers planned on using French Exocet anti-ship missiles as the class's main weapon system. However, due to the high price the French asked for the missile, possibly because of political reasons, the project was changed and two Soviet P-20 (SS-N-2B) were used instead. Self-defense measures include two Wallop Barricade <b>chaff</b> launchers.|$|E
5|$|Joan Elizabeth Curran (26 February 1916 – 10 February 1999) was a Welsh {{scientist}} who played {{important roles in}} the development of radar and the atomic bomb during the Second World War. She invented <b>chaff,</b> a radar countermeasure technique credited with reducing losses among Allied bomber crews. She also worked {{on the development of the}} proximity fuse and the electromagnetic isotope separation process for the atomic bomb.|$|E

5|$|Most {{variants}} of the AW101 {{are equipped with}} self-defence systems, such as <b>chaff</b> and flare dispensers, directed infrared countermeasures (infrared jammers), ESM (electronic support measures {{in the form of}} RF heads), and a laser detection and warning system. British Merlins have been outfitted with protective armour against small-arms fire. A chin-mounted forward looking infrared (FLIR) imaging sensor has been fitted to some variants.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship has}} {{self-defence}} capability and {{is equipped with}} an indigenous anti-missile defence <b>chaff</b> system. On-board systems include fully automatic engine controls, power management and battle damage control systems. According to the navy, the ship was designed to operate as a command platform. The ship is fitted with four AK-630 Close-in weapon systems, which can fire {{at a rate of}} 4,000 to 10,000 rounds a minute.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} {{proposed that}} small boats, towing large radar reflecting balloons (code named Filbert) and carrying both Moonshine jamming and standard wireless equipment (for transmitting fake traffic), would advance toward the French coast {{under a cloud}} of Window. The <b>chaff</b> and other countermeasures would hide {{the small size of}} the naval force while wireless traffic would play on the FUSAG story to mislead the Germans into expecting a major landing. A third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use radar countermeasures on the western flank of the true invasion fleet. This operation was intended to lend confusion as to the extent of the landings in Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was {{the first}} upgrade of the AV-8B. It {{differed}} from the original aircraft in having a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera added {{to the top of}} the nose cone, a wide Smiths Industries head-up display (HUD), provisions for night vision goggles, and a Honeywell digital moving map system. The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures. The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an electronic control system and was more powerful and reliable. The flare and <b>chaff</b> dispensers were moved, and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin's base. Initially known as the AV-8D, the night-attack variant was designated the AV-8B(NA).|$|E
5|$|The Tornado is {{cleared to}} carry the {{majority}} of air-launched weapons in the NATO inventory, including various unguided and laser-guided bombs, anti-ship and anti-radiation missiles, as well as specialised weapons such as anti-personnel mines and anti-runway munitions. To improve survivability in combat, the Tornado is equipped with onboard countermeasures, ranging from flare and <b>chaff</b> dispensers to electronic countermeasure pods that can be mounted under the wings. Underwing fuel tanks and a buddy store aerial refuelling system that allows one Tornado to refuel another are available to extend the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|Winnowing fan: Contemporary to {{the rotary}} air {{conditioning}} fan invented by Han dynasty mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) is a pottery tomb {{model of a}} crank-operated rotary winnowing fan from the Han Dynasty, used for separating <b>chaff</b> from grain. The winnowing fan was first described by the Tang Dynasty writer and linguist Yan Shigu (581–645), in his commentary on the Jijiupian dictionary written earlier in 40 BC by Shi Yu; it was also mentioned in a poem by the Song Dynasty artist Mei Yaochen in about 1060. The earliest known drawn illustration of the winnowing fan comes from the Book of Agriculture published in 1313 by Yuan dynasty inventor and politician Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333).|$|E

5|$|With {{the added}} missile {{capacity}} of the battleships in the 1980s came additional fire-support systems to launch and guide the ordnance. To fire the Harpoon anti-ship missiles, the battleships were equipped with the SWG-1 fire-control system, and to fire the Tomahawk missiles the battleships used either the SWG-2 or SWG-3 fire-control system. In addition to these offensive-weapon systems, the battleships were outfitted with the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie {{to be used as}} a lure against enemy torpedoes, an SLQ-32 electronic warfare system that can detect, jam, and deceive an opponent's radar and a Mark 36 SRBOC system to fire <b>chaff</b> rockets intended to confuse enemy missiles.|$|E
5|$|Farming in Egypt was {{dependent}} on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the <b>chaff</b> from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. As observed in Han miniature tomb models, but not in literary sources, the crank handle was used to operate the fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from <b>chaff.</b> The odometer cart, invented during Han, measured journey lengths, using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century AD, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century AD. Modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the Han dynasty, for example a pair of sliding metal calipers used by craftsmen for making minute measurements. These calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured. These tools are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E

5|$|Some of the ECM {{equipment}} which initially saw {{use on the}} Victor, such as {{the original}} <b>chaff</b> dispenser and Orange Putter tail warning radar, had been developed for the earlier English Electric Canberra bomber and were already considered to be near-obsolete {{by the time the}} Victor had entered service. Significant improvements and alterations would be made to the avionics and ECM suites, as effective ECMs had been deemed critical to the Victor's role; for example, the introduction of the more capable Red Steer tail warning radar. The introduction of the Victor B.2 was accompanied by several new ECM systems, including a passive radar warning receiver, a metric radar jammer and communications jamming equipment. Streamlined fairings on the trailing edges of the wings that could house large quantities of defensive chaff/flares were also new additions. While trials were conducted with terrain-following radar and a side scan mode for the bombing and navigation radar, neither of these functions were integrated into the operational fleet.|$|E
5|$|The JF-17 has a {{defensive}} aids system (DAS) composed of various integrated sub-systems. A radar warning receiver (RWR) provides data such as direction and proximity of enemy radars, and an electronic warfare (EW) suite {{housed in a}} fairing {{at the tip of}} the tail fin interferes with enemy radars. The EW suite is also linked to a Missile Approach Warning (MAW) system to defend against radar-guided missiles. The MAW system uses several optical sensors across the airframe to detect the rocket motors of missiles across a 360-degree coverage. Data from the MAW system, such as direction of inbound missiles and the time to impact, is shown on cockpit displays and the HUD. A countermeasures dispensing system releases decoy flares and <b>chaff</b> to help evade hostile radar and missiles. The DAS systems will also be enhanced by integration of a self-protection radar-jamming pod that will be carried externally on a hardpoint.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{scored a}} notable {{success on the}} night of 2 December 1943 when 105 Ju 88 bombers struck the port of Bari. Skilfully using <b>chaff</b> to confuse the Allied radar operators, they found the port packed with brightly lit Allied shipping. The result was the most {{destructive}} air raid on Allied shipping since the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Hits were scored on two ammunition ships and a tanker. Burning oil and exploding ammunition spread over the harbour. Some 16 ships were sunk and eight damaged, and the port was put out of action for three weeks. Moreover, one of the ships sunk, SS John Harvey, had been carrying mustard gas, which enveloped the port in a cloud of poisonous vapours.|$|E
