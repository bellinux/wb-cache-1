5|$|Before the 19th century, cobalt was {{predominantly}} {{used as a}} pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it {{has been}} used in the production of smalt, a blue colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium carbonate, yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered cobalt green, and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue.</b> Cobalt pigments such as <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> (cobalt aluminate), cerulean blue (cobalt(II) stannate), various hues of cobalt green (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), and cobalt violet (cobalt phosphate) are used as artist's pigments because of their superior chromatic stability. Aureolin (cobalt yellow) is now largely replaced by more lightfast yellow pigments.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is {{primarily}} {{used in the}} preparation of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds, cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue)</b> give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high energy gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Bricks {{facing the}} mosque's {{exterior}} are richly embellished with the Persian-style title work known as kashi-kari. Façades facing the inner courtyard are richly embellished with motifs and palette which display strong influences from 17th century Persia. Persian-style colours used include lajvard (<b>cobalt</b> <b>blue),</b> firozi (cerulean), white, green, orange, yellow, and purple, while Persian-influenced motifs include star-shaped flowers and grapevines. The mosque also contains motifs of cypress trees, {{and is the}} first Mughal monument to have borrowed this motif from Persia.|$|E
25|$|From about 1615, the potters {{began to}} coat their pots {{completely}} in white tin glaze instead of covering only the painting surface and coating the rest with clear glaze. They {{then began to}} cover the tin glaze with a coat of clear glaze which gave depth to the fired surface and smoothness to <b>cobalt</b> <b>blues,</b> ultimately creating a good resemblance to porcelain.|$|R

5|$|Cobalt-based blue {{pigments}} (<b>cobalt</b> <b>blue)</b> {{have been}} used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists {{to be due to}} the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the only}} source for nickel was the rare Kupfernickel. Beginning in 1824, nickel was {{obtained}} as a byproduct of <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> production. The first large-scale smelting of nickel began in Norway in 1848 from nickel-rich pyrrhotite. The introduction of nickel in steel production in 1889 increased the demand for nickel, and the nickel deposits of New Caledonia, discovered in 1865, provided most of the world's supply between 1875 and 1915. The discovery of the large deposits in the Sudbury Basin, Canada in 1883, in Norilsk-Talnakh, Russia in 1920, and in the Merensky Reef, South Africa in 1924, made large-scale production of nickel possible.|$|E
5|$|In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in {{the music}} (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the {{conductor}} in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he {{said that he did}} not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie ("Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple ("gold and brown") to the highly detailed ("blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue,</b> deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant").|$|E
50|$|SF violet skyblues have a {{body colour}} ranging from dark skyblue to medium cobalt. Most look rather like pale cobalts. The colour of the tail and flight {{feathers}} are the most reliable distinguishing features. <b>Cobalts</b> have navy <b>blue</b> tails throughout their length, while Violet Skyblues have tails, which shade to turquoise at the quill end. The flight feathers of <b>Cobalts</b> are dark <b>blue,</b> those of violet skyblues have a glossy turquoise iridescence rather like those of skyblues but slightly darker.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific parrotlets have {{olive green}} and grey bodies and lighter blue {{streaking}} {{back from their}} eyes. It is a dimorphic species. The males have a striking <b>cobalt</b> rump with <b>blue</b> patches on their wings and lighter yellowish green faces. Females are mostly green with much less brightly colored blue patches behind the eyes and no <b>cobalt</b> rump or <b>blue</b> in their wings. These dimorphic color variations are true {{of most of the}} color mutations as well. They are from 10 - 14 cm long.|$|R
40|$|For {{the latter}} half of the 20 th century, cobalt- 60 units were the {{mainstay}} of radiation treatments for cancer. <b>Cobalt</b> <b>Blues</b> describes the development of the first cobalt- 60 unit in the United States and the man behind it, Leonard Grimmett. Conceptually conceived before World War II, it only became possible because of the development of nuclear reactors during the war. Although Grimmett conceived of and published his ideas first, the Canadians built the first units because of the capability of their reactor to produce more suitable cobalt- 60 sources. This book tells the story of how Grimmett and others came together at the time that the U S Atomic Energy Agency was pushing the use of radioactivity in medicine. Due to his sudden death, very little information about Grimmett was known until recently, when various documents have come to light, allowing the full story to be told...|$|R
5|$|Males {{entering}} {{their second}} or third year may develop spotty blue and white plumage during the breeding season. By their fourth year, males have assumed their nuptial plumage, where the scapulars, secondary wing coverts, and secondary flight feathers are white {{while the rest of}} their bodies are a vibrant <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue.</b> All sexually mature males moult twice a year, once before the breeding season in winter or spring, and again afterwards in autumn; rarely, a male may moult directly from nuptial to nuptial plumage. The breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, a {{significant}} part of the world's production of <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue</b> (a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina) and smalt (cobalt glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian Blaafarveværket. The first mines for the production of smalt in the 16th century were located in Norway, Sweden, Saxony and Hungary. With the discovery of cobalt ore in New Caledonia in 1864, the mining of cobalt in Europe declined. With the discovery of ore deposits in Ontario, Canada in 1904 and the discovery of even larger deposits in the Katanga Province in the Congo in 1914, the mining operations shifted again. When the Shaba conflict started in 1978, the copper mines of Katanga Province nearly stopped production. The impact on the world cobalt economy from this conflict was smaller than expected: cobalt is a rare metal, the pigment is highly toxic, and the industry had already established effective ways for recycling cobalt materials. In some cases, industry was able to change to cobalt-free alternatives.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of new synthetic pigments in the 18th and 19th centuries considerably brightened and expanded the palette of painters. J.M.W. Turner experimented {{with the new}} <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue,</b> and of the twenty colours most used by the Impressionists, twelve were new and synthetic colours, including <b>cobalt</b> <b>blue,</b> ultramarine and cerulean blue.|$|E
40|$|Imagine you are {{standing}} in an art museum, mesmerized by an enormous canvas of turbulent paint. Though you find no recognizable images, you are fascinated by the swirling movements of rich azures and <b>cobalt</b> <b>blues.</b> Your eyes follow the artist’s long, energetic brush strokes across the work, and you {{feel a sense of}} motion inside your body. Suddenly, your attention is caught by a small area of densely applied paint—a deep crimson. You linger. The thick color glows. As your awareness of the surroundings dim, the bright spot on the canvas expands, and the sensuous color seems to flow into you. You are immersed. Instants later, the bond breaks, as your attention shifts to a nearby conversation. What a viewer is experiencing in such moments of immersion is a shift in the ordinary sense of one’s bodily boundaries. For an instant, viewer and art work seem to merge...|$|R
50|$|Cobalt (Co) is {{an element}} in period 4, between iron and nickel. Cobalt is {{commonly}} used in pigments, as many compounds of <b>cobalt</b> are <b>blue</b> in color. <b>Cobalt</b> is also a core component of many magnetic and high-strength alloys. The only stable isotope, cobalt-59, {{is an important component}} of vitamin B-12, while cobalt-60 is a component of nuclear fallout and can be dangerous in large enough quantities due to its radioactivity.|$|R

50|$|In 1687 {{the works}} began {{manufacturing}} <b>blue</b> <b>cobalt</b> colour paste, used for painting porcelain and ceramic. According to tradition this was exported by von Berbisdorf to Delft and Venice. The paintworks {{had its own}} jurisdiction and also its own school.|$|R
50|$|González Quiñones {{employed}} traditional {{materials and}} kept {{most of the}} traditional methods. However, he produced both traditional and contemporary designs, with the clay coming from the nearby Sierra de Santa Rosa. The artist used both molds and turntables with 95% of his round items having been made on the latter. His colors and designs were relatively conservative, using mineral paints such as copper oxide for green, antimony for yellow and <b>cobalt</b> for <b>blue,</b> all prepared locally.|$|R
5000|$|Commoners, {{merchants and}} nobles alike used soba-choko every day. The choko's design, shape and quality {{indicate}} {{the class of}} society it was designed for. Most soba-choko were simple, not too ornate and functional. Traditionally designs were applied onto the porcelain body using <b>cobalt</b> oxide (<b>blue)</b> followed by a coat of clear glaze. The more intricate the design, the whiter the porcelain, quality of glazing/designs {{and the use of}} colour (not just blue on white) indicated higher class clientele or specialist production.Designs were hand painted or stenciled in freeform, embedded in frames or placed within bands. Four main design categories were used and included: ...|$|R

Further hydration results in the pink hexaaquacobalt(II) chloride complex Co(H2O)6Cl2.|$|R
25|$|The Japanese {{began to}} make {{porcelain}} early in the 17th century, learning from Chinese and Korean craftsmen how to fire the pieces and make underglaze <b>blue</b> <b>cobalt</b> decoration and overglaze enamel painting. In the mid-17th century the Japanese found a growing market from European traders who were unable to obtain Chinese porcelain due to political upheavals.|$|R
