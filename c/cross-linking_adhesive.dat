30|$|It is {{generally}} possible to confirm that, {{the longer it}} takes for an already <b>cross-linking</b> <b>adhesive</b> to reach {{the surface of the}} adherend, the lower the adhesive forces will be. This tendency is, of course, less critical if a generally less reactive adhesive system is used. Especially with the 2 C PUR 2 material used here, this behavior must be taken into account.|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of inorganic nanoparticles was added as reinforcement to a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) -based epoxy resin modified by a hybrid sol–gel method. Different epoxy/sol–gel systems {{were prepared to}} evaluate their adhesive strength. The mechanical performance of different formulations was characterised by shear and tensile tests to define the influence of nano-fillers on adhesive strength performance of the modified epoxy/hybrid sol–gel. The results obtained indicate that the incorporation of a selected ratio of inorganic nanoparticles in the epoxy/sol–gel adhesive improves the adhesion performance between substrate surfaces. A significant increase in adhesive lap shear strength of the sol–gel modified epoxy, {{compared with that of}} the neat epoxy, was observed. Butt joint strengths of the modified epoxy/sol–gel were also recorded, showing good adhesion behaviour to mild steel surfaces. Tensile strength of joints up to 28. 5 MPa for 16 h/ 150 °C cure time/temperature was observed. The modified system exhibited a high yield point and large extension compared with that of the unmodified epoxy. The study further showed that doping with small amounts of one type of nanoparticle to the system increases <b>adhesive</b> <b>cross-linking.</b> Epoxy/sol–gel <b>adhesive</b> strength was also evaluated as a function of cure temperature for mild steel and Al 2024 -T 3 substrates. Results showed adhesive strength decreased with increased cure temperature on the Al substrate, while lap joint strength of the mild steel exhibited no significant changes at three different cure temperatures. This may be attributed to good interfacial bonding of the sol–gel adhesive to the mild steel over the designated temperature range...|$|R
40|$|E-cadherin is a trans-membrane tumor {{suppressor}} {{responsible for}} epithelial cell adhesion. E-cadherin forms adhesive clusters through combined extra-cellular cis- and trans-interactions and intracellular {{interaction with the}} actin cytoskeleton. Here we identify four populations of E-cadherin within cell junctions based on the molecular interactions which determine their mobility and adhesive properties. Adhesive and non-adhesive populations of E-cadherin each consist of mobile and immobile fractions. Up to half of the E-cadherin immobilized in cell junctions is non-adhesive. Incorporation of E-cadherin into functional adhesions require all three adhesive interactions, with deletion of any one resulting in loss of effective cell-cell adhesion. Interestingly, the only interaction which could independently slow the diffusion of E-cadherin was the tail-mediated intra-cellular interaction. The adhesive and non-adhesive mobile fractions of E-cadherin can be distinguished by their sensitivity to chemical <b>cross-linking</b> with <b>adhesive</b> clusters. Our data define the size, mobility, and adhesive properties of four distinct populations of E-cadherin within cell junctions, and support association with the actin cytoskeleton {{as the first step}} in adhesion formation...|$|R

40|$|To {{prepare a}} low-formaldehyde soy-based {{adhesive}} with good water resistance, phenol-formaldehyde modified with glutaraldehyde (PFG) with lower free phenol and free formaldehyde contents {{was used to}} <b>cross-link</b> the soy-based <b>adhesive.</b> The {{results showed that the}} mechanical properties and water resistance of plywood prepared with soy-based adhesive with PFG was better than that of plywood with the same amount of phenol-formaldehyde (PF). The reaction between phenol and glutaraldehyde was proved by 13 C-NMR. Under the optimized preparation conditions for plywood, that is to say, press temperature 160 °C, press time 4 min and resin loading 320 g·m− 2, type I plywood could be prepared with 9 % PFG as a cross-linker of soy-based adhesive. The Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) result confirmed the cross-linking reaction between soy-based adhesive and PFG or PF.

40|$|We {{designed}} and optimized tissue-responsive adhesive materials by matching material and tissue properties. A two-component material based on dextran aldehyde and dendrimer amine provides a cohesive gel through aldehyde–amine <b>cross-linking</b> and an <b>adhesive</b> interface {{created by a}} dextran aldehyde-selective reaction with tissue amines. By altering aldehyde–amine chemistry, we examined how variations in tissue surfaces (serosal amine density in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) affect interactions with adhesive materials of varied compositions (aldehyde content). Interestingly, the same adhesive formulation reacts differentially with the three regions of the small intestine {{as a result of}} variation in the tissue amine density along the intestinal tract, affecting the tissue–material interfacial morphology, adhesion strength, and adhesive mechanical properties. Whereas tissues provide chemical anchors for interaction with materials, we were able to tune the adhesion strength for each section of the small intestine tissue by altering the adhesive formulation using a two-component material with flexible variables aimed at controlling the aldehyde/amine ratio. This tissue-specific approach should be applied to the broad spectrum of biomaterials, taking into account specific microenvironmental conditions in material design.

40|$|Besides {{functional}} and <b>cross-linking</b> monomers, dental <b>adhesives</b> contain a photo-initiator system for polymerization, thereby providing physico-mechanical strength to the adhesive-tooth interface. Few studies {{have investigated the}} effect of the functional monomer and polymerization-initiation system on the polymerization efficiency of the adhesive. Here, we tested the effect of two different functional monomers (MAC- 10 vs. SR) and two photo-initiator systems, camphorquinone-amine (CQ) vs. borate (BO), on the degree of conversion (DC) of different adhesive formulations. The DC of the CQ-cured adhesive formulations was significantly affected by the MAC- 10 monomer. This should be ascribed to the known inactivation of the amine co-initiator through acid-base reaction. However, the SR monomer did not decrease the DC, which could be attributed to a "gel effect" or the so-called "Trommsdorff-Norrish" phenomenon of enhanced DC with more viscous resins, and to the more favorable availability of CC double bonds. In contrast, the DC of the BO-cured adhesive formulations was not affected by any acidic monomer. It is concluded that the degree of conversion of an adhesive can be affected by the functional monomer, but this depends on the kind of photo-initiator system used. As bond durability depends, among other factors, on the strength and thus degree of conversion of the adhesive, potential interaction between adhesive ingredients and the photo-initiator system definitely needs to be studied further. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objectives This study {{investigated}} {{the effect of the}} strength and wetting characteristics of adhesives on the bond strength to dentin. The experimental adhesives containing various ratios of hydrophobic, low-viscosity Bis-M-GMA, with Bis-GMA and TEGDMA, were made and evaluated on the mechanical properties and bond strength to dentin. Materials and Methods Five experimental adhesives formulated with various Bis-GMA/Bis-M-GMA/TEGDMA ratios were evaluated on their viscosity, degree of conversion (DC), flexural strength (FS), and microtensile bond strength (MTBS). The bonded interfaces were evaluated with SEM and the solubility parameter was calculated to understand the wetting characteristics of the adhesives. Results Although {{there were no significant differences}} in the DC between the experimental adhesives at 48 hr after curing (p > 0. 05), the experimental adhesives that did not contain Bis-GMA exhibited a lower FS than did those containing Bis-GMA (p < 0. 05). The experimental adhesives that had very little to no TEGDMA showed significantly lower MTBS than did those containing a higher content of TEGDMA (p < 0. 05). The formers exhibited gaps at the interface between the adhesive layer and the hybrid layer. The solubility parameter of TEGDMA approximated those of the components of the primed dentin, rather than Bis-GMA and Bis-M-GMA. Conclusions To achieve a good dentin bond, a strong base monomer, such as Bis-GMA, cannot be completely replaced by Bis-M-GMA for maintaining mechanical strength. For compatible copolymerization between the adhesive and the primed dentin as well as dense <b>cross-linking</b> of the <b>adhesive</b> layer, at least 30...|$|R
40|$|Pressure {{sensitive}} adhesives are {{a category}} of adhesives {{which can be used}} for both permanent and removable applications. The use of radiation to cure these materials prior to application is becoming more widespread {{due in part to the}} recent drive to reduce the release of volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants produced from more traditional solvent or thermal curing methods. For the manufacturer, a greater understanding of how these adhesives cure under near to real life conditions is highly desired. This thesis presents the first use of one-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging to provide information on the molecular mobility as revealed by spin relaxation times as a function of depth in <b>cross-linking</b> acrylic <b>adhesives</b> during photoinitiated curing by ultraviolet light. Imperfect curing in these adhesives may lead to crosslink density inhomogeneities and consequently, to variations in the adhesion and cohesion properties throughout the depth of the adhesive. The GARField magnet developed at the University of Surrey, along with a new high temperature sample mounting probe developed during this work allowed thin film samples to be measured at various temperatures with a spatial resolution better than 16 mum. Two separate components were identified in the exponential decay of the NMR signal from the bulk adhesive. These were attributed to the inter-crosslinked network and to lower molecular weight dangling chain ends. Curing was seen to increase the fraction of the shorter component indicative of an increase in crosslink density. GARField profiles showed that formulations with additional multifunctional acrylates produced the highest cure owing to the increased crosslink density afforded by the multifunctional acrylates. However, the addition of these groups also led to a reduced homogeneity in the depth of cure. The inclusion of further photoinitiating species, sensitive to a wider range of wavelengths was shown to reduce this effect. Measurements at 60 °C showed that UV irradiation was more efficient at producing crosslinks at this temperature. However, the contrast between cured and uncured samples on GARField was reduced due to the additional, thermally driven molecular motion. The activation energy for this thermal motion was calculated to be 0. 34 +/- 0. 04 eV and 0. 28 +/- 0. 05 eV for the uncured and cured adhesives, respectively. The irradiation regime only became important when small doses separated by more than 20 minutes were used. This regime led to sufficient build up of oxygen in the upper surface of the adhesive to inhibit the curing reaction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring inflammation, {{myeloperoxidase}} (MPO) {{released by}} circulating leukocytes accumulates within the subendothelial matrix by binding to and transcytosing the vascular endothelium. Oxidative reactions catalyzed by subendothelial-localized MPO are implicated {{as a cause}} of endothelial dysfunction in vascular disease. While the subendothelial matrix is a key target for MPO-derived oxidants during disease, the implications of this damage for endothelial morphology and signaling are largely unknown. We found that endothelial-transcytosed MPO produced hypochlorous acid (HOCl) that reacted locally with the subendothelial matrix and induced covalent <b>cross-linking</b> of the <b>adhesive</b> matrix protein fibronectin. Real-time biosensor and live cell imaging studies revealed that HOCl-mediated matrix oxidation triggered rapid membrane retraction from the substratum and adjacent cells (de-adhesion). De-adhesion was linked with the alteration of Tyr- 118 phosphorylation of paxillin, a key adhesion-dependent signaling process, as well as Rho kinase-dependent myosin light chain- 2 phosphorylation. De-adhesion dynamics were dependent on the contractile state of cells, with myosin II inhibition with blebbistatin attenuating the rate of membrane retraction. Rho kinase inhibition with Y- 27632 also conferred protection, but not during the initial phase of membrane retraction, which was driven by pre-existing actomyosin tensile stress. Notably, diversion of MPO from HOCl production by thiocyanate or nitrite attenuated de-adhesion and associated signaling responses, despite the latter substrate supporting MPO-catalyzed fibronectin nitration. These data show that subendothelial-localized MPO employs a novel “outside-in” mode of redox signaling, involving HOCl-mediated matrix oxidation. These MPO-catalyzed oxidative events are likely to play a previously unrecognized role in altering endothelial integrity and signaling during inflammatory vascular disorders...|$|R
40|$|Biological organisms {{demonstrate}} remarkable {{abilities to}} affix themselves {{to almost any}} surface. Many marine organisms, for instance, are able to synthesize strong adhesive materials to withstand the rough costal conditions. The common blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) illustrates this in their cross-linked, protein-based glue. Not only are these “plaques” strong {{enough to hold the}} animal in place, but the soluble precursor proteins also cure in a wet setting environment, a feature with which commercial glues continue to struggle. Characterization of this intriguing material shows high levels of the amino acid 3, 4 -dihyroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), which is believed to be responsible for the <b>cross-linking</b> and <b>adhesive</b> properties. Peptide mimics of marine mussel adhesives were prepared and cross-linked to obtain atom-by-atom level insights on the chemical cross-links giving rise to the performance of this biological material. ^ Made via a cross-linking mechanism, soybean protein and bovine serum albumin adhesives have been produced through a single step process and are capable of high strengths on both wood and aluminum adherends. The current methods for introducing adhesive properties to protein systems include significant modifications to the protein and the introduction of synthetically functionalized polymer resins, both of which are more expensive than the method proposed. Due to cost, it has been difficult replacing carcinogenic, formaldehyde-based adhesives. However, the proposed method is low cost, non-toxic, requires no modifications or additions to the protein system and requires no additional processing prior to use. Developing a strong, renewable, and non-toxic adhesive will solve many of the adhesive industries current problems, being competitive in many adhesive markets, from surgical to wood to automotive adhesives. ^ Chitons, marine mollusks that feed primarily on algae growing on rocks, have evolved a ribbon-like rasping tongue designed with numerous rows of extremely hard, wear-resistant teeth. These remarkable properties arise from the incorporation of nanocrystalline magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) into a nanofibrous chitin scaffold. Like many biomineralizing organisms, chitons do not form magnetite by classical ion-by-ion crystal growth. Instead, mineralization originates with deposition of a disordered metastable precursor, ferrihydrite, which is subsequently transformed into magnetite. This remarkable polymorph selectivity has been difficult to reproduce in the laboratory, especially the precipitation of ferrihydrite under mild conditions. Using a combination of X-ray absorption and EPR spectroscopy, organic-iron complexes have been identified {{in the early stages of}} mineralization. In vitro experiments demonstrate these complexes facilitate the formation of ferrihydrite under physiological conditions, while completely suppressing the formation of thermodynamically stable crystalline lepidocrocite in the presence of acidic organic molecules, which complex iron. ...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{living creatures}} have {{developed}} adhesion strategies {{to stick to}} inorganic or organic surfaces in wet environments. A classic example of permanent bioadhesion is exemplified by mussels, which secrete adhesive proteins containing {{a high concentration of}} 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) 1, 2. The catechol species of DOPA are thought to be responsible for the strong adhesion to inorganic surfaces, whereas the oxidized o-quinone species trigger the cross-linking of the glue, ensuring cohesion. The unoxidized form of DOPA is known to adhere to a large variety of inorganic surfaces, although the adhesion mechanism is not yet fully understood. 3, 4 A clear understanding is however essential for the design of synthetic adhesive polymers required in many surface science applications. Here we investigate at the single-molecule level the interaction forces between AFM tips coated with bio-inspired polymers and a variety of inorganic and organic surfaces. We prepared polymers bearing several amounts of DOPA units and covalently attached them to AFM tips following our previously published strategy. 5, 6 They were homo-or co-polymers and were cross-linked or not. These original bio-inspired tips were used to perform single-molecule force spectroscopy on a range of model, as well as industrial such as stainless and galvanized steel, substrates. The specific interaction forces measured in water were compared with the ones exerted by the same polymers without DOPA. It was found that, depending {{on the nature of the}} substrate, the presence of DOPA strongly, or only slightly, increases the interaction forces with the surface. We also investigated the influence of the oxidation state of the catechol species on the intensity of the interaction forces. Again, this influence is strongly related to the nature of the substrate. Finally, we studied the effect of polymer <b>cross-linking</b> on the <b>adhesive</b> interactions. 1. Waite, J. H.; Tanzer, M. L. Science 1981, 212, 1038. 2. Waite, J. H.; Housley, T. J.; Tanzer, M.
