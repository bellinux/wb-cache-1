5000|$|Despite the {{advantages}} of high spatial resolution and precise chemical sensitivity attributed to AES, there are several factors that can limit the applicability of this technique, especially when evaluating solid specimens. One {{of the most common}} limitations encountered with Auger spectroscopy are charging effects in non-conducting samples. Charging results when the number of secondary electrons leaving the sample is different from the number of incident electrons, giving rise to a net positive or negative electric charge at the surface. Both positive and negative surface charges severely alter the yield of electrons emitted from the sample and hence distort the measured Auger peaks. To complicate matters, neutralization methods employed in other surface analysis techniques, such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), are not applicable to AES, as these methods usually involve surface bombardment with either electrons or ions (i.e. flood gun). Several processes have been developed to combat the issue of charging, though none of them is ideal and still make quantification of AES data difficult. One such technique involves depositing <b>conductive</b> <b>pads</b> near the analysis area to minimize regional charging. However, this type of approach limits SAM applications as well as the amount of sample material available for probing. A related technique involves thinning or [...] "dimpling" [...] a non-conductive layer with Ar+ ions and then mounting the sample to a conductive backing prior to AES. This method has been debated, with claims that the thinning process leaves elemental artifacts on a surface and/or creates damaged layers that distort bonding and promote chemical mixing in the sample. As a result, the compositional AES data is considered suspect. The most common setup to minimize charging effects includes use of a glancing angle (~10°) electron beam and a carefully tuned bombarding energy (between 1.5 keV and 3 keV). Control of both the angle and energy can subtly alter the number of emitted electrons vis-à-vis the incident electrons and thereby reduce or altogether eliminate sample charging.|$|E

50|$|The {{waste heat}} in a {{high-power}} LED (which as of 2015 can be {{less than half the}} power that it consumes) is conveyed by conduction through the substrate and package of the LED to a heat sink, which gives up the heat to the ambient air by convection.

Medium-power LEDs are often designed to solder directly to a printed circuit board that contains a thermally conductive metal layer.

40|$|The present {{invention}} enables efficient microfabrication of a {{fully integrated}} {{liquid crystal display}} device. Initially, a sacrificial layer is formed on a substrate that has <b>conductive</b> <b>pads</b> connected thereto. The sacrificial layer is patterned, and portions of the sacrificial layer are removed to expose portions of the underlying layer supporting the sacrificial layer. Then, a permeable layer is formed on the sacrificial layer, thereby filling in the space vacated by the removed potions of the sacrificial layer. The structure is heated and the material of the sacrificial layer is allowed to dissolve into and dissipate through the permeable layer in order to leave a cavity. Once the sacrificial layer is removed, the permeable layer is supported by the portion of the permeable layer filling in the space vacated by the removed portions of the sacrificial layer. Accordingly, a monolithic liquid crystal display is easily and reliably formed without having to etch an opening in the structure to allow the sacrificial material to egress from the structure and without having to separately attach mechanical components to each liquid crystal display manufactured.

40|$|International audienceCell fusion {{consists}} of inducing {{the formation of}} a hybridoma cell containing the genetic properties of the progenitor cells. Such an operation is usually performed chemically or electrically. The latter method, named electrofusion, is considered as having a strong potential, due to its efficiency and non-toxicity, but deserves further investigations prior to being applicable for key applications like antibody production and cancer immunotherapy. Indeed, to envision such applications, a high amount of hybrid cells is needed. In this context, we present in this paper a device for massive cell pairing and electrofusion, using a microarray of non-connected <b>conductive</b> <b>pads.</b> The electrofusion chamber [...] or channel [...] exposes cells to an inhomogeneous electric field, caused by the pads array, enabling the trapping and pairing of cells with dielectrophoresis (DEP) forces prior to electrofusion. Compared to a mechanical trapping, such electric trapping is fully reversible (on/off handling). The DEP force is contactless and thus eases the release of the produced hybridoma. Moreover, the absence of wire connections on the pads permits the high density trapping and electrofusion of cells. In this paper, the electric field mapping, the effect of metallic pads thickness, and the transmembrane potential of cells are studied based on a numerical model to optimize the device. Electric calculations and experiments were conducted to evaluate the trapping force. The structure was finally validated for cell pairing and electrofusion of arrays of cells.

40|$|International audienceElectrostatic {{attraction}} {{may be used}} {{to modulate}} the apparent friction coefficient between two surfaces. Applied to the human finger and a polarized interface, the principle can modify the user perception of the interface surface. In this paper, the different steps towards the modeling of the electrovibration phenomenon are developed. An investigation on the current modeling will be carried out, with a focus on the temporal evolution and frequency dependence of the stimulus. Thus, an improvement of the modeling will be proposed to take into account this major effect, and then, it will be checked with an experimental setup and compared with literature results. The last few years have seen an increasing interest for haptic stimulation and simulation. Different technologies are available to provide a tactile feedback to a user by modifying his perception of a surface. In particular, it is possible to control the friction between a surface and a finger thanks to squeeze film effect or to electrovibra-tion. This study is focused on the electrovibration effect: the modulation of the perceived friction coefficient due to the induced electrostatic force between a finger and a high voltage supplied plate [1]. The effect is known since the mid fifties [2], but the interest has raised only recently. Firstly, spatial division of electrode was developed to provide precise and complex stimulus pattern of <b>conductive</b> <b>pads,</b> but this solution suffered from its complexity and turned out difficult to apply [5]. Recently, electrovi-bration took advantage of technological improvements of fingertip's position sensor based on optical or resistive solutions. The possibility to track precisely the position of the finger leads to fine gratings simulation thanks to spatial-stimulus relation. With spatio-temporal transformation, the stimulator itself becomes easier to manufacture and it becomes possible to produce tactile feedback on transparent surfaces [1] or merge it with another tactile stimulation technique [3]. If the efficiency of the process to provide successful tactile feedback is clear, the physical modeling of the phenomenon involving the finger is not yet satisfactory. Th...|$|E

Because the pad's surface area is large relative to the instrument's tip, energy density across the pad is reliably low enough that no tissue injury occurs at the pad site. Electrical shocks and burns are possible, however, if the circuit is interrupted or energy is concentrated in some way. This can happen if the pad surface in contact is small, e.g. if the pad's electrolytic gel is dry, if the pad becomes disconnected from the radio frequency generator, or via a metal implant. Modern electrocautery systems are equipped with sensors to detect high resistance in the circuit that can prevent some injuries.|$|R
