50|$|The Cocuy Liquor or Cocuy is an {{alcoholic}} beverage from the fermented juices of the head, body or leaves of Agave <b>cocui,</b> autochthonous plant from the American tropic, extracted by the artisans {{in the regions}} of Falcón and Lara, in Venezuela. Both the plant and their products have been declared by government decree as a cultural and natural heritage of the Falcon State (October 2000), cultural heritage of the Lara State (November 2001)1 and cultural and ancestral heritage of Venezuela (July 2006).|$|E
5000|$|The Cocuy {{is made by}} hand, {{from the}} stalk, head or {{pineapple}} obtained after removal of the Agave <b>cocui</b> leaves, this is usually baked in artisan ovens at ground level, they coated the walls and bottom with river stones, on which they pile the heads or pads, which are completely covered with leaves removed. The leaves are cooked over low heat with wood. After three to four days in the oven the leaves are removed, and macerated using a wooden bucket and mace. They proceed to manually press to extract the juice, and this is subjected to a process of fermentation and subsequent distillation. (Standard-cocuy Pecayero Covenin 3662).|$|E
40|$|In Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire {{the most}} common species of Agave is A. vivipara. Although the {{variability}} is rather great, this species is nearly always easily recognizable. In Aruba, however, in two localities agaves are found, namely A. Rutteniae and A. arubensis, which differ from A. vivipara in their generative parts only. The A. <b>Cocui,</b> which occasionally occurs in Curaçao and Bonaire, but which has probably been introduced from the coast of Venezuela, differs from these species, both in shape and size. A. Boldinghiana, which is found here and there on alle three islands, is in herbarium material not always easily distinguished from the above named species, in the field it is always easily recognizable. A. Karatto, which is frequently cultivated as a living hedge in Aruba, Curaçao and Bonaire, has very {{little in common with}} the other agaves growing there; this species occurs also in St. Eustatius and the neighbouring islands and it seems probable that it was introduced from there in former times, when there was a more lively trade between these islands. On the Venezuelan Continent there probably is only one species of Agave, A. <b>Cocui,</b> which, however, shows a wide range of variability {{in the form of the}} terminal spine. In Trinidad and Chacachacare A. evadens occurs; possibly it may be found on the neighbouring part of the continent as well. On the Venezuelan Islands, A. vivipara is known from Blanquilla and Los Hermanos, A. <b>Cocui</b> from Los Frailes and Los Testigos. The common agave of Margarita, which I determined as A. vivipara, resembles a special form of A. <b>Cocui</b> growing on the continental coast opposite. Although it seems not possible to differentiate them clearly, yet, for the time being, it does not seem advisable to unite these two species...|$|E
