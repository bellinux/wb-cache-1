40|$|A catemeric crystal {{structure}} of <b>cyheptamide</b> undergoes a {{transformation in the}} solid-state upon heating to produce a dimer-based form whose structure has been determined from laboratory X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data, thereby providing the first conclusive evidence of a carbamazepine analogue crystallising in both hydrogen bonded motifs...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{inducing}} the crystallisation of metastable polymorphs by isomorphous templating {{has been developed}} and used to reproduce the crystallisation of CBZ-V {{on the surface of}} DHC-II. Studies of the growth of CBZ-V on DHC-II single crystals show crystals growing laterally and vertically on DHC-II surfaces without any significant face selectivity. The generality of this computationally inspired crystallisation approach is demonstrated by producing the first crystals of an entirely new polymorph of <b>cyheptamide,</b> which is isomorphous to both DHC-II and CBZ-V...|$|E
