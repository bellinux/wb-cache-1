40|$|Metal {{nanowires}} (NWs) {{have attracted}} much attention because of their high electron conductivity, optical transmittance and tunable magnetic properties. Metal NWs have been synthesized using soft templates such as surface stabilizing molecules and polymers, and hard templates such as anodic aluminum oxide, mesoporous oxide, carbon nanotubes.

30|$|In the LiNbO 3 -PDMS {{composite}} nanogenerator, stable {{power generation}} {{depended on the}} mixing ratio. LiNbO 3 has high piezoelectricity, but is fragile and lossy. In contrast, PDMS has flexibility and a low dielectric constant, but no piezoelectricity. Nearly the same power generation, dielectric constant, and loss after excessive strain suggest that our LiNbO 3 -PDMS composite nanogenerator was quite stable; this was attributed to the low volume ratio of LiNbO 3 inside the PDMS (approximately 1 %). If the volume ratio of LiNbO 3 were to increase, then the power generation would increase as well {{at the expense of}} a larger dielectric constant; however, the <b>composite</b> <b>devices</b> may become fragile and lossy. Therefore, we suggest that optimization of the mixing ratio is crucial for the application of a lead-free piezoelectric composite nanogenerator.|$|E
