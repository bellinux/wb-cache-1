40|$|Any {{release of}} anthrax spores in the U. S. would require action to decontaminate {{the site and}} restore its use and {{operations}} as rapidly as possible. The remediation activity would require environmental sampling, both initially {{to determine the extent}} of contamination (hazard mapping) and post-decon to determine that the site is free of contamination (clearance sampling). Whether the spore contamination is within a building or outdoors, collecting and analyzing what could be thousands of samples can become the factor that limits the pace of restoring operations. To address this sampling and analysis bottleneck and decrease the time needed to recover from an anthrax contamination event, this study investigates the use of <b>composite</b> <b>sampling.</b> Pooling or compositing of samples is an established technique to reduce the number of analyses required, and its use for anthrax spore sampling has recently been investigated. However, use of <b>composite</b> <b>sampling</b> in an anthrax spore remediation event will require well-documented and accepted methods.
