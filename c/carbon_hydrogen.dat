5|$|<b>Carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> oxygen, nitrogen, {{phosphorus}} and sulfur {{are sometimes}} referred to or categorised as organogens, CHONPS elements or biogens. Collectively these six nonmetals are required for all life on Earth. They are further distinguished—in comparison to the halogens (F, Cl, Br, I, At) and noble gases—by their general capacity (or potential) to form allotropes; high atomisation energies; intermediate electron affinities; reactivity combined with low toxicity; ability to form alloys with metals; and the weak or neutral acid-base character of their group hydrides.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
25|$|PET, as {{with many}} plastics, is also an {{excellent}} candidate for thermal disposal (incineration), as it is composed of <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> and oxygen, with only trace amounts of catalyst elements (but no sulfur). PET has the energy content of soft coal.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{explosives}} mechanics {{is based}} on the shock-sensitive rapid oxidation of <b>carbon</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> to <b>carbon</b> dioxide, carbon monoxide and water in the form of steam. Nitrates typically provide the required oxygen to burn the <b>carbon</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> fuel. High explosives tend to have the oxygen, <b>carbon</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> contained in one organic molecule, and less sensitive explosives like ANFO are combinations of fuel (<b>carbon</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> fuel oil) and ammonium nitrate. A sensitizer such as powdered aluminum may be added to an explosive to increase the energy of the detonation. Once detonated, the nitrogen portion of the explosive formulation emerges as nitrogen gas and toxic nitric oxides.|$|R
50|$|The {{dust cloud}} is {{generated}} using the Nihka motor dust generator. The dust cloud {{is composed of}} aluminum oxide, <b>carbon</b> monoxide, <b>hydrogen</b> chloride, water, and nitrogen, as well as smaller amounts of <b>carbon</b> dioxide, <b>hydrogen,</b> monatomic chlorine, and monatomic hydrogen.|$|R
40|$|CeO 2, {{alone or}} mixed with La 2 O 3, {{is used as}} halogen {{adsorbent}} in the determination of <b>carbon</b> and <b>hydrogen.</b> Quantitative data are given on the adsorption of the single halogens on various samples of pure CeO 2 and La 2 O 3. Retention of CO 2 {{and the influence of}} several parameters of special interest in the <b>carbon</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> determination, have been examined. It has been found that the conditions for optimum adsorption of the halogens are a large surface and relatively low adsorption temperature. Unfortunately these conditions cannot be applied in the determination of <b>carbon</b> and <b>hydrogen...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{steady-state}} assumption {{dates to}} the ideas of material balance developed to model the growth of microbial cells in fermenters in bioprocess engineering. During microbial growth, a substrate consisting of a complex mixture of <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> oxygen and nitrogen sources along with trace elements are consumed to generate biomass.|$|E
25|$|Amino acids are biologically {{important}} {{organic compounds}} composed of amine (-NH2) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional groups, {{along with a}} side-chain specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> oxygen, and nitrogen, though other elements {{are found in the}} side-chains of certain amino acids.|$|E

25|$|In 1796, German-Russian chemist Johann Tobias Lowitz {{obtained}} pure ethanol {{by mixing}} partially purified ethanol (the alcohol-water azeotrope) with {{an excess of}} anhydrous alkali and then distilling the mixture over low heat. French chemist Antoine Lavoisier described ethanol as a compound of <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> and oxygen, and in 1807 Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure determined ethanol's chemical formula. Fifty years later, Archibald Scott Couper published the structural formula of ethanol. It {{was one of the}} first structural formulas determined.|$|E
25|$|This is most {{pronounced}} when the boron compound has very bulky substituents. One organoboron reagent {{that is often}} employed in synthesis is 9-BBN which is generated from the reaction of cyclooctadiene and diborane. Hydroborations take place stereospecifically in a syn mode, {{that is on the}} same face of the alkene. In this concerted reaction the transition state is represented as a square with the corners occupied by carbon, <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> and boron with maximum overlap between the two olefin p-orbitals and the empty boron orbital.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to TRUEX, an extraction process using a malondiamide has been devised. The DIAMEX (DIAMideEXtraction) process {{has the advantage of}} avoiding the formation of organic waste which contains elements other than <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> nitrogen, and oxygen. Such an organic waste can be burned without the formation of acidic gases which could contribute to acid rain (although the acidic gases could be recovered by a scrubber). The DIAMEX process is being worked on in Europe by the French CEA. The process is sufficiently mature that an industrial plant could be constructed with the existing knowledge of the process. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism.|$|E

25|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of peat bogs {{from the area}} also revealed numerous anomalies considered consistent with an impact event. The isotopic signatures of stable <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> and nitrogen isotopes at the layer of the bogs corresponding to 1908 {{were found to be}} inconsistent with the isotopic ratios measured in the adjacent layers, and this abnormality was not found in bogs located outside the area. The region of the bogs showing these anomalous signatures also contains an unusually high proportion of iridium, similar to the iridium layer found in the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. These unusual proportions are believed to result from debris from the falling body that deposited in the bogs. The nitrogen {{is believed to have been}} deposited as acid rain, a suspected fallout from the explosion.|$|E
25|$|Colonies on the Moon, Mars, or asteroids could extract local materials. The Moon is {{deficient}} in volatiles such as argon, helium and compounds of <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> and nitrogen. The LCROSS impacter was targeted at the Cabeus crater which {{was chosen as}} having {{a high concentration of}} water for the Moon. A plume of material erupted in which some water was detected. Mission chief scientist Anthony Colaprete estimated that the Cabeus crater contains material with 1% water or possibly more. Water ice should also be in other permanently shadowed craters near the lunar poles. Although helium is present only in low concentrations on the Moon, where it is deposited into regolith by the solar wind, an estimated million tons of He-3 exists over all. It also has industrially significant oxygen, silicon, and metals such as iron, aluminum, and titanium.|$|E
25|$|All {{life forms}} require certain core {{chemical}} elements needed for biochemical functioning. These include <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—the elemental macronutrients for all organisms—often {{represented by the}} acronym CHNOPS. Together these make up nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, the bulk of living matter. Five of these six elements comprise the chemical components of DNA, the exception being sulfur. The latter is {{a component of the}} amino acids cysteine and methionine. The most biologically abundant of these elements is carbon, which has the desirable attribute of forming multiple, stable covalent bonds. This allows carbon-based (organic) molecules to form an immense variety of chemical arrangements. Alternative hypothetical types of biochemistry have been proposed that eliminate {{one or more of these}} elements, swap out an element for one not on the list, or change required chiralities or other chemical properties.|$|E

25|$|Molecules of {{carbohydrates}} and fats consist of <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides (glucose, fructose and galactose) to complex polysaccharides (starch). Fats are triglycerides, made of assorted fatty acid monomers bound to a glycerol backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are essential in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms {{in addition to}} carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing amino acids, {{some of which are}} essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production, just as ordinary glucose, in a process known as gluconeogenesis. By breaking down existing protein, the carbon skeleton of the various amino acids can be metabolized to intermediates in cellular respiration; the remaining ammonia is discarded primarily as urea in urine.|$|E
25|$|Albert Einstein's {{development}} {{of the theory of}} relativity in 1905 led to the understanding that nuclear reactions could create new elements from smaller precursors, with the loss of energy. In his treatise Stars and Atoms, Arthur Eddington suggested that pressures and temperatures within stars were great enough for hydrogen nuclei to fuse into helium; a process which could produce the massive amounts of energy required to power the Sun. In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements might also form within stars. Spectral evidence collected after 1945 showed that the distribution of the commonest chemical elements, <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> oxygen, nitrogen, neon, iron etc., was fairly uniform across the galaxy. This suggested that these elements had a common origin. A number of anomalies in the proportions hinted at an underlying mechanism for creation. Lead has a higher atomic weight than gold, but is far more common. Hydrogen and helium (elements 1 and 2) are virtually ubiquitous yet lithium and beryllium (elements 3 and 4) are extremely rare.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that any extraterrestrial life that might exist {{will be based}} on the same fundamental biochemistry as found on Earth, as the four elements most vital for life, <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> oxygen, and nitrogen, are also the most common chemically reactive elements in the universe. Indeed, simple biogenic compounds, such as very simple amino acids such as glycine, have been found in meteorites and in the interstellar medium. These four elements together comprise over 96% of Earth's collective biomass. Carbon has an unparalleled ability to bond with itself and to form a massive array of intricate and varied structures, making it an ideal material for the complex mechanisms that form living cells. Hydrogen and oxygen, in the form of water, compose the solvent in which biological processes take place and in which the first reactions occurred that led to life's emergence. The energy released in the formation of powerful covalent bonds between carbon and oxygen, available by oxidizing organic compounds, is the fuel of all complex life-forms. These four elements together make up amino acids, which in turn are the building blocks of proteins, the substance of living tissue. In addition, neither sulfur, required for the building of proteins, nor phosphorus, needed for the formation of DNA, RNA, and the adenosine phosphates essential to metabolism, is rare.|$|E

500|$|Chemical {{analysis}} showed that the proportions of <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> nitrogen, and phosphorus in this active portion {{were consistent with the}} chemical composition of DNA. [...] To show that it was DNA rather than some small amount of RNA, protein, or some other cell component that was responsible for transformation, Avery and his colleagues used a number of biochemical tests. [...] They found that trypsin, chymotrypsin and ribonuclease (enzymes that break apart proteins or RNA) did not affect it, but an enzyme preparation of [...] "deoxyribonucleodepolymerase" [...] (a crude preparation, obtainable from a number of animal sources, that could break down DNA) destroyed the extract's transforming power.|$|E

Its sources include outgassing and sputtering, {{a product of the}} bombardment of lunar soil by solar wind ions. Elements that have been detected include sodium and potassium, produced by sputtering (also found in the atmospheres of Mercury and Io); helium-4 and neon from the solar wind; and argon-40, radon-222, and polonium-210, outgassed after their creation by radioactive decay within the crust and mantle. The absence of such neutral species (atoms or molecules) as oxygen, nitrogen, <b>carbon,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> and magnesium, which are present in the regolith, is not understood. Water vapour has been detected by Chandrayaan-1 and found to vary with latitude, with a maximum at ~60–70degrees; it is possibly generated from the sublimation of water ice in the regolith. These gases either return into the regolith due to the Moon's gravity or are lost to space, either through solar radiation pressure or, if they are ionized, by being swept away by the solar wind's magnetic field.|$|E
