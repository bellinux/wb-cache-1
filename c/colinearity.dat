50|$|Hox {{genes are}} genes in humans that {{regulate}} body plan development. Humans have {{four sets of}} Hox genes, numbering 39 genes altogether, all of which aid in the differentiation of cells by location. Hox genes are activated early {{in the development of}} the embryo, in order to plan the development of the differing structures of the body. They also show <b>colinearity</b> with the body plan, meaning that the order of the Hox genes is similar to the expression levels of the Hox genes on the anterior-posterior axis. This <b>colinearity</b> allows for a spatial and temporal activation of genes in order to produce a proper body structure.|$|E

N. van der Walt Bellville campus Date submitted: October 2011 It is important to quantify polymeric components in a coating because they greatly influence {{the performance of a}} coating. The difficulty associated with analysis of polymers by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis’s is that <b>colinearities</b> arise from similar or overlapping spectral features. A quantitative FTIR method with attenuated total reflectance coupled to multivariate/ chemometric analysis is presented. It allows for simultaneous quantification of 3 polymeric components; a rheology modifier, organic opacifier and styrene acrylic binder, with no prior extraction or separation from the paint. The factor based methods partial least squares (PLS) and principle component regression (PCR) permit <b>colinearities</b> by decomposing the spectral data into smaller matrices with principle scores and loading vectors. For model building spectral information from calibrators and validation samples at different analysis regions were incorporated. PCR and PLS were used to inspect the variation within the sample set. The PLS algorithms were found to predict the polymeric components the best. The concentrations of the polymeric components in a coating were predicted with the calibration model. Three PLS models each with different analysis regions yielded a coefficient of correlation R 2 close to 1 for each of the components. The root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was less than 5 %. The best out-put was obtained where spectral features of water was included (Trial 3). The prediction residual values for the three models ranged from 2 to - 2 and 10 to - 10. The method allows paint samples to be analysed in pure form and opens many opportunities for other coating components to be analysed in the same way...|$|R

2500|$|For {{geometries}} defined using {{complex number}} or quaternion coordinates, however, {{the situation is}} more complicated. For instance, in the complex projective plane there exists a configuration of nine points, Hesse's configuration (the inflection points of a cubic curve), in which every line is non-ordinary, violating the Sylvester–Gallai theorem. Such a configuration {{is known as a}} Sylvester–Gallai configuration, and it cannot be realized by points and lines of the Euclidean plane. Another way of stating the Sylvester–Gallai theorem is that whenever the points of a Sylvester–Gallai configuration are embedded into a Euclidean space, preserving <b>colinearities,</b> the points must all lie on a single line, and the example of the Hesse configuration shows that this is false for the complex projective plane. However, [...] proved a complex-number analogue of the Sylvester–Gallai theorem: whenever the points of a Sylvester–Gallai configuration are embedded into a complex projective space, the points must all lie in a two-dimensional subspace. Similarly, [...] showed that whenever they are embedded into a space defined over the quaternions, they must lie in a three-dimensional subspace.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{and validity of}} applying variation partitioning methods in community ecology has been questioned. Here, using mathematical deduction and numerical simulation, we made an attempt to uncover the underlying mechanisms determining the effectiveness of variation partitioning techniques. The covariance among independent variables determines the under-fitting and over-fitting problem with the variation partitioning process. Ideally, {{it is assumed that}} the covariance among independent variables will be zero (no correlation at all), however, typically there will be some <b>colinearities.</b> Therefore, we analyzed the role of slight covariance on influencing species variation partitioning. We concluded that when the covariance between spatial and environmental predictors is positive, all the three components-pure environmental, spatial variations and mixed covariation were over-fitted, with the sign of the true covariation being negative. In contrast, when the covariance is negative, all the three components were under-fitted with the sign of true covariation being positive. Other factors, including extra noise levels, the strengths of variable coefficients and the patterns of landscape gradients, could reduce the fitting problems caused by the covariance of variables. The conventional calculation of mixed covariation is incorrect and misleading, as the true and estimated covariations are always sign-opposite. In conclusion, I challenge the conventional three-step procedure of variation partitioning, suggesting that a full regression model with all variables together is robust enough to correctly partition variations. ...|$|R

5000|$|From 1997 to 2001, Duboule's {{laboratory}} has {{approached the}} problem of collinearity at the mechanistic level by using ES cell-based genetics; Hox genes are controlled at a global level, which involves their respective positions in the gene cluster. In 2001, a link is established between temporal <b>colinearity</b> (the Hox clock) and the somitic clock, such as to coordinate the progression of somites and their specifications. From 1998 onwards, this laboratory has used two home-designed genetic approaches TAMERE and STRING to embark on an in vivo analysis of large-scale gene regulation, leading to the concepts of ‘regulatory landscapes’ or archipelagos. This large allelic series has allowed to recently unravel the mechanisms underlying <b>colinearity</b> in the developing limbs. The axial organization of our legs and arms indeed matches the linear organization of regulatory chromatin domains. The transition between these chromosomal domains matches the wrist, i.e. the transition between the old (arms and legs) and the [...] "novel" [...] (hands and feet) part of our appendages. Duboule has also studied in details the biochemical mechanisms underlying Hox gene regulation the processing of the Hox clock during {{the formation of the}} main body axis. This clock is linked to a transition in chromatin domains, which is accompanied by a step-wise switch of genes from a negative to a positive chromatin compartment. The potential importance and meaning of these observations for our understanding of gene regulation during development and morphological evolution have been discussed in several reviews.|$|E

We sought to determine, whether this was also true for non-high-risk patients. 540 consecutive patients underwent breast MRI for assessment of breast findings (BI-RADS 0 - 5, non-high-risk screening (no familial history of breast cancer, no known genetic mutation, no prior chest irradiation, or previous breast cancer diagnosis)) and subsequent histological work-up. For this IRB-approved study, BPE and fibroglandular tissue FGT were retrospectively assessed by two experienced radiologists according to the BI-RADS lexicon. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to explore associations between BPE, FGT, age and final diagnosis of breast cancer. Subsequently, multivariate logistic regression analysis, considering covariate <b>colinearities,</b> was performed, using final diagnosis as the target variable and BPE, FGT and age as covariates. Age showed a moderate negative correlation with FGT (r = - 0. 43, p< 0. 001) and a weak negative correlation with BPE (r = - 0. 28, p< 0. 001). FGT and BPE correlated moderately (r = 0. 35, p< 0. 001). Final diagnosis of breast cancer displayed very weak negative correlations with FGT (r = - 0. 09, p = 0. 046) and BPE (r = - 0. 156, p< 0. 001) and weak positive correlation with age (r = 0. 353, p< 0. 001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, the only independent covariate for prediction of breast cancer was age (OR 1. 032, p< 0. 001).

This strategy led to the Indonesian economy being stretched positively after {{the economic crisis}}. Taking effective decisions is not spared from combining four BSC perspectives and strategies that focus on a system with different behavior or steps.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the influence of variables that synergized between balanced scorecard with SEM as a means of strategic planning in the future. This study used primary data with a large enough sample to meet the maximum likelihood estimation by assessment scale of seven semantic points. This research model is a combination of one and two step models. The next step is to test the measurement model, structural equation modeling, and modification models.

50|$|A useful {{molecular}} marker {{known as a}} simple sequence repeat (SSR) is used in breeding with respect to selection. SSRs are segments of a genome composed of tandem repeats of a short sequence of nucleotides, usually two to six base pairs. They are popular tools in genetics and breeding because of their relative abundance compared to other marker types, {{a high degree of}} polymorphism (number of variants), and easy assaying by polymerase chain reaction. However, they are expensive to identify and develop. Comparative genome mapping has revealed a high degree of similarity in terms of sequence <b>colinearity</b> between closely related crop species. This allows the exchange of such markers within a group of related species, such as wheat, rye and triticale. One study established a 58% and 39% transferability rate to triticale from wheat and rye, respectively. Transferability refers to the phenomenon where the sequence of DNA nucleotides flanking the SSR locus (position on the chromosome) is sufficiently homologous (similar) between genomes of closely related species. Thus, DNA primers (a generally short sequence of nucleotides are used to direct a copying reaction during PCR) designed for one species can be used to detect SSRs in related species. SSR markers are available in wheat and rye, but very few, if any, are available for triticale.|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} of surface drift of floating objects {{is an important}} task, with applications such as marine transport, pollutant dispersion, and search-and-rescue activities. But forecasting even the drift of surface waters is very challenging, because it depends on complex interactions of currents driven by the wind, the wave field and the general prevailing circulation. Furthermore, although each of those can be forecasted by deterministic models, the latter all suffer from limitations, resulting in imperfect predictions. In the present study, we try and predict the drift of two buoys launched during the DART 06 (Dynamics of the Adriatic sea in Real-Time 2006) and MREA 07 (Maritime Rapid Environmental Assessment 2007) sea trials, using the so-called hyper-ensemble technique: different models are combined {{in order to minimize}} departure from independent observations during a training period; the obtained combination is then used in forecasting mode. We review and try out different hyper-ensemble techniques, such as the simple ensemble mean, least-squares weighted linear combinations, and techniques based on data assimilation, which dynamically update the model’s weights in the combination when new observations become available. We show that the latter methods alleviate the need of fixing the training length a priori, as older information is automatically discarded. When the forecast period is relatively short (12 h), the discussed methods lead to much smaller forecasting errors compared with individual models (at least three times smaller), with the dynamic methods leading to the best results. When many models are available, errors can be further reduced by removing <b>colinearities</b> between them by performing a principal component analysis. At the same time, this reduces the amount of weights to be determined. In complex environments when meso- and smaller scale eddy activity is strong, such as the Ligurian Sea, the skill of individual models may vary over time periods smaller than the forecasting period (e. g. when the latter is 36 h). In these cases, a simpler method such as a fixed linear combination or a simple ensemble mean may lead to the smallest forecast errors. In environments where surface currents have strong mean-kinetic energies (e. g. the Western Adriatic Current), dynamic methods can be particularly successful in predicting the drift of surface waters. In any case, the dynamic hyper-ensemble methods allow to estimate a characteristic time during which the model weights are more or less stable, which allows predicting how long the obtained combination will be valid in forecasting mode, and hence to choose which hyper-ensemble method one should use.

In 1989, description of 'temporal colinearity' (the Hox clock) an extension of the same principle of <b>colinearity</b> to the timing in the transcriptional activation of these genes. In 1989, with Krumlauf's laboratory, discovery of the structural conservation of the entire homeotic systems between mouse and flies; a single homeotic complex existed in the ancestral animal at the basis of the protostome/deuterostome lineages. In 1989 and 1991, first reports that the same genetic system had been co-opted to take part to the organization of structures along different axial structures, in particular the limbs and the genito-urinary tract. The extension of this work to birds, in collaboration with Cheryll Tickle and Lewis Wolpert demonstrated both the high degree of interspecies conservation and the crucial function of these genes during limb development. In 1991, concept of ‘posterior prevalence’, which accounts for the functional organization of Hox genes.

The relation between the clinical measures of JCA activity was determined by Pearson correlation coefficients. An r value of 0. 7  or greater was considered evidence of <b>colinearity.</b>  RESULTS—Among the subjective variables, parent global assessment of overall well being and parent assessment of pain were correlated with each other; the physician assessment of disease activity did not show evidence of <b>colinearity</b> with any other variable.

We repeated the process until all VIFS were under the cutoff threshold of 10 as proposed by Neter et al. (1996).|$|E
40|$|The left {{part of the}} Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome {{exhibits}} a strong <b>colinearity</b> of structural and functional elements with the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene loci which is only partially reflected in nucleotide sequence homologies. We propose that this <b>colinearity</b> {{may be the result}} of an inter-dependent co-evolution of the immunoglobulin loci together with EBV. Our observation could help elucidating the mechanisms of somatic hypermutation, explaining the ability of EBV to accidentally cause tumors, and shedding more light on the general mechanisms of viral and organismal evolution. We suggest that persisting viruses served as a complement for the organismal germline like in a ping-pong game and outline The Ping-Pong Evolution Hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|The {{arrangement}} of Hox genes into physical clusters {{is fundamental to}} the patterning of animal body plans, through the phenomenon of <b>colinearity.</b> Other homeobox genes are often described as dispersed, implying they are not arranged into clusters. Contrary to this view, however, two clusters of non-Hox homeobox genes have been reported: the amphioxus ParaHox gene cluster and the Drosophila 93 D/E cluster (referred to here as the NKL cluster). Here I examine the antiquity of these gene clusters, their conservation and their pattern of evolution in vertebrate genomes. I argue that the ParaHox gene cluster arose early in animal evolution, and duplicated in vertebrates to give the four clusters in human and mouse genomes. The NKL cluster is also ancient, and also duplicated to yield four descendent clusters in mammalian genomes. The NKL and Hox gene clusters were originally chromosomal neighbours, within an ancient and extensive array of at least 30 related homeobox genes. There is no necessary relationship between clustering and <b>colinearity,</b> although {{it is argued that}} the ParaHox gene cluster does show modified spatial <b>colinearity.</b> A novel hypothesis for the evolution of ParaHox gene expression in deuterostomes is presented...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe ANTP {{family of}} {{homeodomain}} transcription factors {{consists of three}} major groups, the NKL, the extended Hox, and the Hox/ParaHox family. Hox genes and ParaHox genes are often linked in the genome forming two clusters of genes, the Hox cluster and the ParaHox cluster, and are expressed along the major body axis in a nested fashion, following the relative positions of the genes within these clusters, a property called <b>colinearity.</b> While the presences of a Hox cluster and a ParaHox cluster appear to be primitive for bilaterians, few taxa have actually been examined for spatial and temporal <b>colinearity,</b> and, aside from chordates, even fewer still manifest it. Here we show that the ParaHox genes of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus show both spatial and temporal <b>colinearity,</b> but with peculiarities. Specifically, {{two of the three}} ParaHox genes-discovered through the S. purpuratus genome project-Sp-lox and Sp-Cdx, are expressed in the developing gut with nested domains in a spatially colinear manner. However, transcripts of Sp-Gsx, although anterior of Sp-lox, are detected in the ectoderm and not in the gut. Strikingly, the expression of the three ParaHox genes would follow temporal <b>colinearity</b> if they were clustered in the same order as in chordates, but each ParaHox gene is actually found on a different genomic scaffold (> 300  kb each), which suggests that they are not linked into a single coherent cluster. Therefore, ParaHox genes are dispersed in the genome and are used during embryogenesis in a temporally and spatially coherent manner, whereas the Hox genes, now fully sequenced and annotated, are still linked and are employed as a complex only during the emergence of the adult body plan in the larva...|$|E
