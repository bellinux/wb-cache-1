Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E

Low pressure inflation hoses may fail to connect properly, or the non-return valve may leak. A burst low pressure hose will usually lose gas faster than a burst high pressure hose, as HP hoses usually have a flow restriction orifice in the fitting that screws into the port, as the SPG does not need high flow, and a slower pressure increase in the gauge hose is less likely to overload the gauge, while the hose to a second stage must provide high peak flow rate to minimize work of breathing.

50|$|A <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor is a {{relatively}} expensive component in an EMB caliper. The cost is derived from its high unit value from a supplier, as well as marked production expenses because of its inclusion. The later emanates from the complex assembly procedures dealing with small tolerances, as well as on-line calibration for performance variability from one <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor to another. The successful use of a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor in an EMB system poses a challenging engineering task. If a clamp forcesensor is placed close to a brake pad, {{then it will be}} subjected to severe temperature conditions reaching up to 800 Celsius that will challenge its mechanical integrity. Also temperature drifts must be compensated for. This situation can be avoided by embedding a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor deep within the caliper. However, embedding this sensor leads to hysteresis that is influenced by friction between the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor and the point of contact of an inner pad with the rotor. This hysteresis prevents a true <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> to be measured. Due to the cost issues and engineering challenges involved with including the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor, it might be desirable to eliminate this component from the EMB system. A potential opportunity to achieve this presents itself in accurate estimation of the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> based on alternative EMB system sensory measurements leading to the omission of a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor.|$|E

Because the micromanipulator is a kind of compact construction which is suitable for valve installation with small space in surgery, especially for the influence of disinfection method, there are major difficulties and limitations to integrate compact sensors in the end of micromanipulator. This article focuses on the 3 -degree-of-freedom micromanipulator’s <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> sensing, and these three joints are actuated by wirerope driving. A <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> sensing method is proposed based on static tension of wirerope driving, and a static model between the <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> and wirerope’s static tension is established considering the influence of real friction resistance in the mechanical system.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the problem of}} estimating <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> in an electro-mechanical brake (EMB) for an automotive brake-by-wire (BBW) system. A <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor is typically used in EMB designs {{and the elimination of}} this component is strongly demanded due to implementation difficulties and cost issues. The motivation behind this thesis is to make developmental inroads into the deficiencies provided by previous attempts to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force.</b> Previous attempts have deficiencies for high speed braking applications as well as handling thermally dependent parameter variations. A dynamic stiffness model to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> is developed that relies on the actuator resolver sensor and two additional temperature sensors. Previous attempts to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> have been stiffness based and have not been capable of successfully modelling parameter variations in response to heating. This thesis introduces new developments on how to model stiffness parameter variations under the influence of heating. Two temperature sensors are required to be employed in this new approach. These additional sensors will not have a considerable impact towards the cost savings created by omitting a <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> sensor. A torque balance model to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> is also developed that relies on the actuator resolver sensor and actuator motor current sensors. A training strategy is used for the dynamic stiffness and torque balance models to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> so that wear dependent parameters can be adapted. The two independent models to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> are fused using various sensor fusion algorithms to give improved estimates of <b>clamp</b> <b>force.</b> A maximum-likelihood estimator is used to optimize the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of estimation. This is followed by implementing a Kalman filter to estimate <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> in an EMB. The dynamic stiffness model is used as the state space equation in the Kalman filter, whilst the torque balance model is used to give measurement updates. Experimental verification showed that the Kalman filter was more accurate than the maximum-likelihood estimator as expected, however the Kalman filter required more computational burden. A RMSE of 0. 5 kN was attained for the Kalman filter and 0. 56 kN for the maximum-likelihood estimator...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} an electro-mechanical dual acting pulley {{continuously variable}} transmission (EMDAP CVT) system and presents a method of measuring belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> indirectly using a DC motor current sensor. The EMDAP CVT mainly consists of two movable primary (input) and secondary (output) pulley sheaves connected by metal pushing V-belt. Two DC motor’s actuation systems adjust the CVT ratio. Additionally, the secondary actuation system controls belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> by adjusting the flatness of the spring discs placed {{at the back of}} each secondary pulley sheave to keep the belt tight and prevent belt slip. Ideally, a force sensor is used to measure the belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> however the use of force sensor inside transmission gearbox is not feasible due to high temperature and oily environment. A viable solution for indirectly measuring the <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> using current sensor for DC motor is proposed. Since the DC motor actuates the movable pulleys to clamp the belt, the relationship between the DC motor current and belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> can then be investigated experimentally. The results will give positive impact on precisely controlling belt-pulley <b>clamping</b> <b>force</b> of EMDAP CVT using current sensor which is relatively simpler and less expensive than force sensor...|$|R

30|$|Lag screws {{which have}} {{benefits}} of minimal loosening and slippage {{during the initial}} application of loads are increasingly used to join timber members [1]. Construction management {{is an important component}} of ensuring lag screw joints are sufficiently strong, which require managers to exercise more caution than with bolt joints. For example, lag screws often cause wood cracking if screwed in without drilling a pilot hole, or driven in using a hammer [1]. These concerns are not limited to wood cracking: over-tightening lag screws may cause such joints to no longer perform at their true strength. Take for example the case of using a wrench to join a steel plate (or washer) to a timber member with a lag screw. Some of the force generated acts as a compressive force on the timber member, which generates an equivalent pull-out force on the lag screw. Tightening the lag screw until the pull-out force exceeds the wood’s pull-out strength causes the axial force on the joint (“clamp force” below) to weaken, leading to poor adhesion between the two members. Among other construction management-related considerations, builders should ensure that lag screw joints are fastened with the proper amount of torque to prevent this from happening. To determine what constitutes “proper” torque, it is imperative to determine first the degree of <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> caused by tightening a lag screw, and second how that <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> relates to the pull-out strength of that screw. While many studies have been conducted on screw joints’ pull-out strength, shear strength, and other mechanical properties [2 – 9], we can find none that regard the relationship between <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> and pull-out force for lag screws. We are currently developing a high damping shear wall, in which the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> of lag screws in wood acts as a frictional resistance force between two timber members or between a timber member and a steel plate [10]. Controlling the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> {{is an important part of}} generating the frictional resistance in this project. We thus became interested in clarifying the relationship between <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> and pull-out strength in lag screws, to investigate techniques for controlling the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> of lag screws.|$|E
40|$|In {{electromechanical}} brakes, central controllers require {{accurate information}} about the <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> between brake pad and disc {{as a function of}} pad displacement. This function is usually denoted as characteristic curve of the caliper. In a typical electromechanical braking system, <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> measurements vary with actuator displacements in a hysteretic manner. Due to ageing, temperature and other environmental variations, the hysteretic characteristic curve of calliper varies with time. Therefore, automatic caliper calibration in real time is vital for high-performance braking action and vehicle safety. Due to memory and processing power limitations, the calibration technique should be memory efficient and of low computational complexity. This chapter investigates the hysteresis as a nonlinear effect in the electromechanical brakes, and describes a technique to parametrically model this effect. This technique is a simple and memory-efficient real-time calibration method in which a Maxwell-slip model is fitted to the data samples around each hysteresis cycle. Experimental results from the data recorded in various temperatures show that this technique results in <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> measurements with less than 0. 7 % error over the range of <b>clamp</b> <b>force</b> variations.
