40|$|A {{network of}} {{perivascular}} nerve fibres was demonstrated in <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> and veins from guinea-pig and man. Nerve fibres displaying immunoreactivity to neuropeptide Y (NPY) had a distribution pattern {{similar to those}} containing immunoreactivity to tyrosine hydroxylase. Immunoreactivity to substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) occurred in the same varicose nerve fibres, which were distinct from those displaying immunoreactivity to NPY, and NPY-immunoreactive nerve fibres were distinct from those displaying acetylcholinesterase activity. Only few nerve fibres positive for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) were detected. Immunoreactivity to endothelin was demonstrated over the endothelium, and mRNA encoding the endothelin-A (ET-A) and the endothelin-B (ET-B) receptor were detected in human epicardial <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> with and without endothelium and in human coronary veins. Vasomotor responses to different vasoactive substances were tested on isolated coronary vessels. Noradrenaline (NA) and adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) induced mainly contraction of human epicardial coronary veins, whereas relaxant responses were more pronounced in human epicardial <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> <b>Coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> from older individuals were however more susceptible to NA-mediated contraction than those from younger persons. Relaxation of human epicardial <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> induced by NA, isoprenaline and ATP were endothelium-independent. NPY had no direct vasomotor effect on human epicardial <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> and veins, but in guinea-pig epicardial <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> NPY inhibited relaxant responses induced by acetylcholine (ACh), VIP, substance P and isoprenaline. ACh induced strong contraction of human epicardial <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> and veins, and at lower concentrations ACh induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of human epicardial <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> Substance P, CGRP and VIP potently relaxed <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> and veins. In human epicardial <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries,</b> the relaxation to substance P was endothelium-dependent whereas the relaxation to CGRP seemed to be partially endothelium-dependent, and relaxation to VIP independent of an intact endothelium. Studies with different agonists and antagonists to ET-A and ET-B receptors suggested that contractions are mediated by the ET-A receptor and relaxations mediated by the ET-B receptor. The ET-B receptor mediated relaxation of human epicardial <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> was endothelium-dependent...|$|R

5|$|<b>Coronary</b> <b>artery</b> {{disease is}} also known as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease.|$|E

50|$|The <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> are the <b>arteries</b> of the <b>coronary</b> {{circulation}} that transport {{blood into}} and out of the cardiac muscle. They are mainly composed of the left and right <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> both of which give off branches.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to test the ability of regenerated endothelium to evoke endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations. Hyperpolarizations induced by serotonin and bradykinin were compared in isolated porcine <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> with native or regenerated endothelium, 4 weeks after balloon endothelial denudation. The experiments were performed in the presence of inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (N(ω) -nitro-L-arginine) and cyclooxygenase (indomethacin). The transmembrane potential was measured using conventional glass microelectrodes. Smooth muscle cells from <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> with regenerated endothelium were depolarized in comparison with control <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> from the same hearts. Spontaneous membrane potential oscillations of small amplitude or spikes were observed in some of these arteries but never in arteries with native endothelium. In <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> from control pigs, both serotonin and bradykinin induced concentration-dependent hyperpolarizations. In the presence of ketanserin, 10 μmol/L serotonin induced a transient hyperpolarization in control <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> Four weeks after balloon denudation, the response to serotonin was normal in arteries with native endothelium, but the hyperpolarization was significantly lower in <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> with regenerated endothelium. In control arteries, the endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization obtained with bradykinin (30 nmol/L) was reproducible. Four weeks after balloon denudation, comparable hyperpolarizations were obtained in <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> with native endothelium. By contrast, in arteries with regenerated endothelium, the hyperpolarization to bradykinin became voltage-dependent. In the most depolarized cells, the hyperpolarization to bradykinin was augmented. The changes in resting membrane potential and the alteration in endothelium- dependent hyperpolarizations observed in the <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> with regenerated endothelium may contribute to the reduced response to serotonin and the unchanged relaxation to bradykinin described previously. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Histologic examination and measurement of the arteries also revealed findings comparable with those in normal hearts. These findings suggest a relatively constant developmental pattern of the proximal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> despite different hemodynamics between the concordantly connected heart and the heart with complete transposition.

40|$|<b>Coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> supply {{blood to}} the myocardium. The blood flow within the <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> is altered by various {{compounds}} produced within the body. Sex hormones such as testosterone are known to cause the relaxation of large <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> But the response to testosterone is greater in in vivo conditions compared to in vitro conditions. We hypothesize that the responses of LADs (left anterior descending arteries) and its side branches to testosterone are heterogeneous and testosterone-induced vasodilation is greater in its side branches. Therefore, our {{study was designed to}} determine the effect of testosterone in different-sized <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> LADs and one of its side branches were isolated from porcine hearts and mounted in organ baths to mimic in vivo conditions. The <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> were then preconstricted with potassium chloride (KCl) and administered increasing concentrations of testosterone to determine if the responses to testosterone vary within different regions of the coronary circulation. The testosterone caused significant relaxation in both LADs and its side branches. However the side branches showed similar responses to testosterone as compared to the larger, upstream LADs. Further studies on androgen receptor expression using real time PCR indicated that androgen receptor expression was higher in LADs than its side branches. A third group of small <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> exhibited greater androgen receptor expression than the LADs and its side branches. The enhanced testosterone-induced vascular reactivity exhibited in vivo may be {{at the level of the}} small <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries,</b> not the LAD and its side branches...|$|R

CGRP concentration-dependently (10 [*]pM[*]–[*] 100 [*]nM) decreased the [Ca 2 +]i and tension of <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> precontracted with either U 46619 or BAY K 8644, and also of resting <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> in PSS. In 36 [*]mM K+-depolarized arteries, CGRP reduced only the tension without affecting the [Ca 2 +]i. In 300 [*]nM U 46619 - precontracted arteries, pretreatment with 10 [*]μM thapsigargin significantly (P< 0. 05) attenuated the CGRP-induced reduction in the tension (but not [Ca 2 +]i). In 300 [*]nM U 46619 -precontracted arteries, pretreatment with either 100 [*]nM charybdotoxin or 100 [*]nM iberiotoxin or 10 [*]nM felodipine significantly (P< 0. 05) attenuated the CGRP-induced reduction in both [Ca 2 +]i and tension. In contrast, 1 [*]μM glibenclamide {{did not affect the}} CGRP-induced responses in these <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> In resting <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries,</b> only pretreatment with the combination of 1 [*]μM glibenclamide and 100 [*]nM charybdotoxin attenuated the CGRP-induced decrease in the [Ca 2 +]i and tension, suggesting a different mechanism of action for CGRP in resting <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> We conclude that CGRP relaxes precontracted rat <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> via three mechanisms: (1) a decrease in [Ca 2 +]i by inhibiting the Ca 2 + influx through membrane hyperpolarization mediated partly by activation of the large conductance Ca 2 +-activated potassium channels, (2) a decrease in [Ca 2 +]i presumably by sequestrating cytosolic Ca 2 + into thapsigargin-sensitive Ca 2 + storage sites and (3) a decrease in the Ca 2 +-sensitivity of the contractile apparatus.
