40|$|A pruned {{stand of}} {{eucalypt}} clone underwent five thinning treatments with {{the removal of}} different proportion of the planted trees, at different ages: a) 0 % - unthinned, b) 35 % at 55 months, c) 35 % at 81 months, d) 70 % at 81 months, removing sprouts in the thinned plant stumps and, e) 70 % at 81 months, without coppice sprouts removal. By the age of 141 months, the Weibull distribution showed higher number of trees in the smallest diameter classes for the unthinned treatment. The 70 % thinning, with thinned coppice sprouts removal, presented higher number of individuals in the largest diameter classes. Height and yield were the smallest with the removal of 70 % of the trees at 81 months, maintaining coppice sprouts. The afterthinning periodic annual increment was greater by thinning 35 % of the trees at 55 months resulting in greater number of trees in the largest diameter classes {{as compared to the}} other treatments. Yield was higher for the unthinned treatment. The results of this study indicated that thinning 70 % of the trees at the age of 81 months, with <b>coppice</b> <b>sprout</b> removal, could be recommended to obtain trees of larger diameter for multiproduct...|$|E
40|$|Tree growth {{variables}} and {{properties of the}} wood and bark were evaluated for 3 -year-old coppice grown hybrid poplar. Three clones (NE- 5323, NE- 5326, and NE- 5377) from a Populus x euramericana cross, each growing at 5, 000, 10, 000, and 15, 000 stems/ha were studied. This material was then used for the manufacture of 40 lb/ft(2 ̆ 73) homogeneous flakeboards {{in an attempt to}} evaluate the effects of the raw material quality on properties of flakeboard;Height, diameters at one foot and 4. 5 feet, the proportions of stem and branch material, and the number of sprouts per stump were significantly different among all clones and planting densities. Clone NE- 5323 had the best overall height and diameter growth. Height and diameter growth for all clones was greater than that reported for first rotation 3 -year-old hybrid poplar. The proportions of stem material and the number of sprouts per stump decreased with increasing planting density;Wood and bark specific gravity, wood fiber length, vessel segment length, bark fiber length, the proportions of cell types (i. e., fibers, vessels, rays, parenchyma), the proportion of bark, and bark thickness were also determined from the single, dominant <b>coppice</b> <b>sprout</b> of each tree. Planting density did not {{have a significant effect on}} any of these characteristics. The wood and bark quality of clone NE- 5323 was superior to the other two clones. Partial correlation coefficients among all characteristics were calculated;Moduli of elasticity and rupture in bending, internal bond, thickness swell, linear expansion, water absorption, and strength properties after accelerated aging were determined for homogeneous flakeboards made from material from each clone and planting density;No significant differences in any strength or dimensional stability properties could be attributed to clone or planting density effects. Compared to the properties of flakeboards made from material from the main stem only, strength and dimensional stability properties were significantly less for flakeboards that contained main stem and branch material...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of tree {{characteristics}} {{were used as}} indicators of overstory structure on four oak woodland sites in southeastern Arizona. Three areas harvested at different times and intensities were compared with an undisturbed area to assess effects of harvesting on various structural attributes of woodland overstories. Structural vegetation changes affect habitat quality and thus wildlife populations in modified areas. Significant differences were found for some woodland structural characteristics between harvested areas and an undisturbed area. Structural changes persist, as prolific <b>coppice</b> <b>sprouting</b> produces shrub-like trees, which appear to take a relatively long time to reach mature height and form. Managers {{might be able to}} moderate impacts of harvests on woodland structure by adjusting harvest intensity, and multiple-use management objectives for some species of wildlife still might be met...|$|R
40|$|Assimilation and {{photosynthetic}} efficiency (quantum yield) of young oaks were compared in coppice and standard sessile oak stands of comparable age (100 - 120 years) under different light intensity categories. Measurements of assimilation response were performed during three consecutive growing seasons (2012, 2013 and 2014). In every category 8 young oaks of generative origin and {{same number of}} <b>coppice</b> <b>sprouts</b> of different stool were measured. The quantum yield in optimal conditions in standards was highest in the category A of closed canopy, while in coppices in category C. During severe drought in 2013 the drop in efficiency of standards was evident in all categories, while in coppices no differences in efficiency were confirmed between optimal and drought stress, proving the advantage of young coppices over standards...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{of water}} use in dryland oak {{ecosystems}} {{is critical for}} the application of intensive management strategies. Thinning prescriptions of Emory oak (Quercus emoryi) <b>coppice</b> (<b>sprouts)</b> to accelerate tree growth are becoming common. The effects of thinning on estimated transpiration rates of Emory oak coppice were determined by the sap-flow velocity method. Rootstocks were thinned to one, two, or three dominant sprouts, or left as untreated controls. Results showed that there were differences in transpiration rates among the rootstocks for each of the thinning treatments and control. The daily transpiration rate for all rootstocks averaged 20 liters per day and ranged from 4 liters in the winter to 52 liters in the summer. The unthinned rootstocks transpired 80 % of the annual precipitation whereas the rootstocks thinned to one residual sprout transpired 34 %. Seasonal variations of the transpiration rates were likely attributed to changes in precipitation and solar radiation...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{was to determine the}} differential responses of poplar clones from sections Tacamahaca and Aigeiros of the genus Populus to varying levels of applied water and nitrogen. Above- and below-ground phenology and morphology, photosynthate allocation, and physiological processes were examined. By manipulating the availability of soil resources, {{we have been able to}} separate inherent clonal differences from plastic responses, and to determine genotype-environment interactions. We also have been able to make some contrasts between trees grown from hardwood cuttings and <b>coppice</b> <b>sprouts.</b> Our overall hypothesis was that carbon allocation during growth is greatly influenced by interactions among moisture, nitrogen, and genotype, and that these interactions greatly influence yield in short-rotation plantations. As is true of any project, some of our original expectations were not realized, whereas other initially unforeseen results were obtained. The reduced funding from the Biofuels Feedstock Development Program (BFDP) during the last few years of the project slowed us down to some extent, so progress was not been as rapid as we might have hoped. The major problem associated with this funding shortfall was the inability to employ skilled and unskilled student labor. Nonetheless, we were able to accomplish most of our original goals. All of the principal investigators on this project feel that we have made progress in advancing the scientific underpinning of short-rotation woody biomass production...|$|R

A {{study was}} carried out along the western bank of the Blue Nile in north Gezira to {{determine}} the extent of natural regeneration of Ziziplus spina-christi (Linn). An area of 5. 3 ha, located on the "Gerf" slope, was chosen for the study, and ten plots, 25 x 25 m, were randomly selected. The number of trees of seed origin, <b>coppice</b> and <b>sprouts</b> were counted in each plot.

40|$|Coppicing is a {{very common}} {{practice}} in South African forestry. It allows a plantation grower {{to have a second}} timber rotation without replanting and thus reduces reestablishment costs. While the large variation in wood properties among different Eucalyptus resources is well documented, little information is available on the quality of wood of the coppice shoots and whether it is {{different from that of the}} original planted trees. In this paper, tree growth, wood density and anatomical characteristics of coppice and original parent wood were measured using rapid screening tools. Six different Eucalyptus genotypes aged seven years were harvested from a research trial in Zululand, South Africa in 1997. Cut stumps were allowed to coppice and managed to produce one to two <b>coppice</b> <b>sprouts.</b> In 2005, the coppiced stems from the same original trees were sampled at the age of eight years. In total, fifty four trees were selected for both types of wood. The wood of parents and coppiced trees were similar in terms of vessels characteristics and fibre wall thickness. However, the parent trees had significantly smaller fibres with smaller lumen. Consequently, the wood density of the parent trees was higher than that of the coppiced trees. A serious drought which occurred during the growth of the parent trees was associated with marked changes in certain wood properties. This made it difficult to assess the real effect of coppicing on wood quality. The ability to predict the quality of coppiced trees is important for the future strategy of growers. If productivity yield and wood quality of coppiced trees are comparable to those of parent trees, then coppicing would be a preferable option to replanting since it can greatly reduce reestablishment and management costs...|$|R
50|$|True hickories sprout prolifically from stumps after {{cutting and}} fire. As the stumps {{increase}} in size, {{the number of}} stumps that produce sprouts decreases; age is probably directly correlated to stump size and <b>sprouting.</b> <b>Coppice</b> management is a possibility with true hickories. True hickories are difficult to reproduce from cuttings. Madden discussed the techniques for selecting, packing, and storing hickory propagation wood. Reed indicated that the most tested hickory species for root stock for pecan hickory grafts were mockernut and water hickory (Carya aquatica).|$|R
40|$|The Kitakyushu City area, {{in which}} the University of Occupational and Envionmental Health, Japan (UOEH) campus lies, is {{situated}} {{in the region of}} the evergreen broad-leaf, or laurel-leaf, forests. Our studies on relict forest stands revealed that the original forest communities in the area were Cyrtomio-Litseetum japonicae and Euonymo-Pittos-poretum tobirae in the coastl area, Arisemato ringentis-Machiletum thunbergii in the bottomland, Symploco-Castanopsietum sieboldii and Ardisio-Castanopsietum sieboldii in. foothill area, and Distylio-Cyclobalanopsietum stenophyllae, Actinodaphnetum lancifoliae and Skimmio-Cyclobalanopsietum acutae on the mountain slopes. The secondary forests in the area are Castanopsis-Cyclobalanopsis <b>coppice</b> of <b>sprout</b> origin, red-pine forest and deciduous forests of various dominants. The original forest on the UOEH campus is assumed to be Symploco-Castanopsietum sieboldii, an evergreen broad-leaf forest, some 25 m high and I m dbh in canopy trees. The secondary forest on the campus is doin inated by Quercus serrata, accompanied by Rhus succedanea, Platycarya strobilacea and Castanopsis cuspidata var. sieholdii. A small wetland near the north gate is dominated by Typha angustata. Slopes on the campus, which were created by cutting-off or fillingup of the ground, are invaded by Miscanthus sinensis, Solidago altissima (alien) and many other herbaceous plants. One hundred and thirty-six species of flowering plants and eight specles of ferns were recorded from the campus. Conservation problems are discussed from the standpoint of vegetation science. 1) 医生ケ丘をふくむ北九州市西部は, 全域が照葉樹林域にある. 残存林分の調査によって, 沿岸地帯-内陸の原植生が推定され, 医生ケ丘一帯はスダシイ-ミミズバイ群集域であることが明らかとなった. 2) 現存植生の二次林は, シイーカシ萌芽林とカラスザンショウ群落が優勢である. 医生ケ作の二次林では, コナラが優占し, ハゼノキ・ノグルミが常に出現する. 向陽地では林床にウラジロまたはコシダが優占している. 3) 湿地にはガマ・ヒメガマ・イグサが優占する. 4) 医生ケ丘で種子植物 131 種, シダ植物 8 種を記録した. 5) 大学構内の緑化について, 植生学の立場から付言し, 特に残存林および西北部の湿原群落の保存の重要性を指摘した...|$|R
40|$|California's {{hardwood}} rangelands, an oak-dominated woodland system, cover 10 million acres. More than 80 % {{of these}} lands are privately owned, with two-thirds grazed by domestic livestock. Public concerns about long-term damage to habitat in areas harvested for firewood — {{particularly in the}} northern Sacramento Valley — led to this study of resprouting, to assess long-term trends in oak cover following harvesting and the potential of <b>sprout</b> (<b>coppice)</b> management to sustain woodlands. In field surveys on 103 sample plots at 19 ranches where oak firewood was harvested, we found that 54 % of all oak stumps resprouted. Stump diameter, herbicide application, overstory crown cover percentage, and slope and aspect were significant variables in models developed to assess the probability of stump sprouting. Ten-year sprout height and crown growth models were developed, and livestock grazing, residual overstory canopy, herbicide treatment and stump diameter {{were found to be}} significant variables. These models can be used to predict stand development following firewood harvest and can be integrated with forage growth, wildlife habitat and residual tree growth models...|$|R
40|$|Water use by {{mature and}} <b>sprout</b> (<b>coppice)</b> forms of Emory oak (Quercus emoryi) was {{estimated}} by the sap-flow method. Five standards and five coppice trees were sampled {{in an area that}} had been harvested for fuelwood and five mature trees were sampled in an uncut area. Differences were recognized between coppice and standards in the cut area and between coppice trees and mature trees from the uncut area. Regression equations were derived relating estimated annual water use to tree diameter, height, and crown measurements for both cut- and uncut-area trees. Seasonal water use by each tree form showed relationship to precipitation, but little relationship to temperature and relative humidity. Woodland density and tree size measurements facilitate extrapolation of water use from the 15 sampled trees to a per area basis. Water use was approximately 1900 cubic meters per hectare per year, based upon drc measurements, for the uncut area and 3168 cubic meters for the cut area. Estimated water use on a per unit area was approximately 1. 67 times greater for the cut area than the uncut area...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} was conducted to find the influence of some topographic factors on distribution of large-leaved lime (Tilia platyphyllos Scop.) and its natural regeneration characteristics in &quot;Vaz&quot; forest (northern Iran). After identification of site and preparation of topography map, selective sampling method was carried out for tree inventory in plots. The sample plots were circular in 1000 -m 2 areas with at least 2 - 3 dominant lime trees in each. In the plots, altitude, slope gradient, direction, forest storey, tree type and natural regeneration were investigated. Results indicate that in this habitat the average diameter at breast height and height of Tilia platyphyllos is 36. 9 cm and 23 m, respectively. Tilia platyphyllos prefers 1200 - 1400 m altitude, 75 - 100 % slope gradient and northeastern to eastern directions and benefits from denser trees in these environments. It consists of some tree types together with Fagus orientalis, Carpinus betulus and Parrotia persica, whereas the dominant type is Tilia platyphyllos-Fagus orientalis. In most of tree types, lime occurs in the upperstorey. Natural regeneration of lime is often observed as <b>sprout</b> (<b>coppice</b> shoot) ...|$|R
