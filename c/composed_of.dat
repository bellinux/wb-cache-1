Scleractinians are also distinguished from rugosans by their pattern of septal insertion.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes enclosed by a conical capsid <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24.
