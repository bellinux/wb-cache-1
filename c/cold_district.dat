40|$|Around {{the world}} {{indigenous}} groups have traditionally used leaves, bark and roots containing tannins to treat diarrhea and intestinal parasites in humans and livestock. Traditional veterinary medicine {{has largely been}} replaced by pharmaceuticals {{throughout most of the}} world. My aim is to revitalize traditional veterinary practices and connect them to novel research. This study includes a literature review based mostly on three articles about condensed tannins (CT), all from New Zealand: Barry & McNabb (1999), Niezen et al. (1995 & 1996), and Høeg (1974). These are considered in light of my observations and experiences of beneficial effect from feeding sheep with high-tannin forage. CT have been reported to increase absorption of essential amino acids in the small intestines. This results in increased wool growth, body mass, milk production and amount of protein in milk. CT seem to counteract protein loss caused by gut parasitism and may stimulate the immune system. CT may also inactivate parasite larvae during passage through the gut. Forage containing CT could offer a nutritionally-based ecologically sustainable system for controlling the effects of parasites. Tannins might also be a way to reduce the large amount of grain fed to sheep and cattle. Traditional practices could be a means to better health and economy for traditional societies. This is especially important when crops containing CT are available in great amounts or can be grown in mountain or <b>cold</b> <b>districts</b> where grains are difficult to grow...|$|R

40|$|The {{foothill}} {{areas of}} Canterbury {{consist of a}} large portion of the province, extending from the Conway River in the north to the Waitaki River in the south, a distance of some 230 miles. This same area varies in width from a few miles behind Methven, and Mayfield to some 80 miles in a part of North Canterbury, with much variation between these limits. Except in parts of North Canterbury, the climate generally is more severe and the rainfall higher than on the Plains. There is, of course, much variation. The soil, in general, is second class, but much variation exists, so that good rich pockets and small flats are not uncommon. Large areas of tussock and also of third-class land-poor, clay, scrub country-are prominent in certain districts. A rough estimate of the area of ‘the foothill, farms in Canterbury is 2, 000, 000 acres. A typical farm or small sheep-run in this area consists of some medium flat land, a fair proportion of rolling downs with steep gullies, and possibly, an unploughable tussock or scrub area. The total ploughable area varies considerably between properties, but on an average might be one-half to three-quarters of the area of the farm, the total area of which might be 1, 200 acres. The average carrying capacity would be one to one and a half sheep per acre, and a few cattle would be carried. The sheep, in the main; are half-breds, but in many of the wetter and <b>colder</b> <b>districts</b> and on the sour, clay soils Romney sheep are preferred.

Surplus four and five year old breeding ewes, fat and store lambs, some fat ewes, store wethers, cull ewe lambs, and cull two-tooth ewes, together with wool and some cattle, constitute the main source of farm income.
