5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker.</b> The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E

40|$|Leadless <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> are {{self-contained}} intracardiac {{devices that}} can be implanted entirely inside the right ventricle of the heart.

Leadless pacemakers are an emergent technology for which there are only preliminary results available.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{estimate}} the possible effect of cellular radio on implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> in elevators. We previously investigated pacemaker EMI in elevator by examining the E-field distribution of horizontal plane at the height of expected for implanted pacemakers inside elevators. In this paper, we introduce our method for estimating EMI impact to implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> using EMF distributions inside the region of the human body in which pacemakers are implanted. Simulations of a human phantom in an elevator are performed and histograms are derived from the resulting EMF distributions. The computed results of field strengths are compared with a certain reference level determined from experimentally obtained maximum interference distance of implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers.</b> This enables us to carry out a quantitative evaluation of the EMI impact to pacemakers by cellular radio transmission. This paper uses a numerical phantom model developed based on an European adult male. The simulations evaluate EMI on implantable <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> in three frequency bands. As a result, calculated E-field strengths are sufficiently low to cause the pacemaker to malfunction in the region examined...|$|R

2500|$|There is also {{evidence}} that digoxin increases vagal activity, thereby decreasing heart rate by slowing depolarization of pacemaker {{cells in the}} AV node.

2500|$|In sensory neurons, action {{potentials}} {{result from}} an external stimulus. However, some excitable cells require no such stimulus to fire: They spontaneously depolarize their axon hillock and fire action potentials at a regular rate, like an internal clock. The voltage traces of such cells {{are known as}} pacemaker potentials. [...] The <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemaker</b> cells of the sinoatrial node in the heart provide a good example. Although such pacemaker potentials have a natural rhythm, it can be adjusted by external stimuli; for instance, heart rate can be altered by pharmaceuticals as well as signals from the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The external stimuli do not cause the cell's repetitive firing, but merely alter its timing. In some cases, the regulation of frequency can be more complex, leading to patterns of action potentials, such as bursting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the left ventricular systolic synchronization in patients implanted with dual-chamber DDD mode <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> by real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT 3 DE). Twenty patients implanted with DDD mode cardiac pace-makers for 12 months and 20 healthy subjects underwent RT 3 DE. This method provided left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LESV), stroke volume (SV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the mean value of the time to minimal systolic volume of the 16 left ventricular segments (Tmean), the standard deviation of Tmean (T-SD), the maximal difference of the time to minimal systolic volume of the 16 left ventricular segments (Tmax) and time-volume curves of the 16 left ventricular segments. Results showed that compared with the healthy group, LESV was significantly increased (P< 0. 05), SV and LVEF were significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) and T-SD and Tmax were significantly prolonged (P< 0. 05) in patients implanted with DDD mode <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers.</b> The time to minimal systolic volume of the 16 left ventricular segments time-volume curves differed in patients implanted with DDD mode <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers.</b> Asynchronization of the left ventricular systolic performance in patients implanted with DDD mode <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> was observed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Magnetic fields may {{interfere}} with the function of <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). Neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, which are small in size but produce strong magnetic fields, have become widely available in recent years. Therefore, NdFeB magnets {{may be associated with}} an emerging risk of device interference. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a clinical study to evaluate the potential of small NdFeB magnets to interfere with <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> and ICDs. METHODS: The effect of four NdFeB magnets (two spherical magnets 8 and 10 mm in diameter, a necklace made of 45 spherical magnets, and a magnetic name tag) was tested in forty-one ambulatory patients with a pacemaker and 29 patients with an ICD. The maximum distance at which the magnetic switch of a device was influenced was observed. RESULTS: Magnetic interference was observed in all patients. The maximum distance resulting in device interference was 3 cm. No significant differences were found with respect to device manufacturer and device types. CONCLUSION: Small NdFeB magnets may cause interference with <b>cardiac</b> <b>pacemakers</b> and ICDs. Patients should be cautioned about the interference risk associated with NdFeB magnets during daily life...|$|R
