5|$|The film's {{special effects}} were {{supervised}} by RKO department head Vernon L. Walker. Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, {{the scene in}} which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera <b>craning</b> upwards over the performance scene, then a curtain wipe to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with {{the scene of the}} workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.|$|E
25|$|Males are {{territorial}} {{of their}} roosts, and will often fight other intruding males {{by means of}} boxing. Males follow a pattern of behavioral stages before fighting. This entails ear movements, head lifts, neck <b>craning,</b> wing unfolding, punch mimicking, and finally boxing with each other. Even though this is aggressive behavior, either male is allowed to stop fighting and leave the conflict, and injuries usually aren't worse than a few scrapes and bruises. It is also shown that males use distinct vocalizations during conflicts, which {{might be used to}} determine the identity of the competitor, and based on that information, parts of the pre-fighting stages can be skipped, and the animals will begin boxing.|$|E

Jurek also gave note to how Rick Rubin made the two-discs sound like it were recorded at one gig, writing [...] "Producer Rick Rubin stays out of the way; his production seems to be in terms of shaping the live sound to make it sound like this is all one gig." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne said that it was an [...] "accurate aural snapshots of what it's like {{to be part of a}} crowd <b>craning</b> to see the action on a stage that seems two miles away."

50|$|In 1875, the {{partnership}} with Nixon and Croft, {{the manager of}} Yerra Yerra, was dissolved and Tooth left for England, leaving <b>Cran</b> in charge. Tooth began a new refinery, also called Yengarie, in the Philippines in his own name. The Tooth and <b>Cran</b> partnership was dissolved in 1879 and Robert <b>Cran</b> and Company ran Yengarie. In 1880 <b>Cran</b> {{spent some time in}} Europe arranging for machinery for a new refinery he planned to build in Bundaberg. This was opened in 1883 as Millaquin and <b>Cran</b> provided land at Yengarie for a short branch line and siding to connect the complex to the state railway. In 1885 there were 40 mills and 5 distilleries along the Mary River, although production and sugar prices began to fall.

2500|$|Sackville-West become {{involved}} in planning the coronation of Rezā Khan, and {{got to know the}} six-year old Crown Prince Mohammad Reza fairly well. She noted how the Persian court were obsessed with attempting to ensure the coronation was up to European standards and remarked [...] "there was no point, however humble, on which they would not consult their British friends", with their guidebook being a copy of [...] "the proceedings at Westminster Abbey for the Coronation of His Majesty George V". Much to her amusement, Sackville-West was asked by one Persian minister what a [...] "Rougedragon Poursuivant" [...] was, believing it was a type of animal. On the coronation day, Sackville described waking up to a [...] "Tehran spruce and furnished beyond recognition". At the Golestan Palace, the throne room which housed the fabled Peacock Throne had been [...] "repainted, the garden paved, such breaches in the walls as revealed the presence of rubbish-heaps were to be filled up". Observing the coronation of Rezā Khan upon the Peacock Throne, Sackville-West referred to the Shia clergymen as a [...] "bevy of bearded old men in long robes and turbans" [...] who appeared like the [...] "baleful chorus of a Greek play". Sackville-West noted that everyone seemed to dislike the Shia clerics and kept a distance from them. Rezā Khan was due to enter the throne room of the Golestan Palace at precisely 3 pm for the coronation, but Sackville-West noted how everyone become tense when the shah was half an hour late, which caused alarm as Rezā Khan was well known for his punctuality and had his ministers flogged if they were late to cabinet meetings. Finally, the main doors opened and in marched Rezā Khan, dressed in his finest uniform and wearing a blue clock, and everyone fell silent. Despite her disdain for the Persian monarchy as [...] "absurd", Sackville-West found the coronation captivating as she found herself <b>craning</b> her neck to see Rezā Khan march up to the Peacock Throne. Walking besides him was his son, the Crown Prince Mohammad Reza, who she wrote was [...] "frightened, possessed himself of a corner of his father's clock". Finally, Sackville-West noted that Rezā Khan crowned himself. In her account of her visit to the former capital of Isfahan to see the Safavid palaces, Sackville-West's repeated use of the word [...] "we" [...] is misleading as it suggests that only Nicolson accompanied her to Isfahan, when in fact, Raymond Mortimer, her husband's lover also traveled in the same car with them.|$|E

40|$|To improve low-latency {{computing}} {{and communication}} services, {{a new type}} of mobile edge computing architecture named multi-layer cloud radio access network (Multi-layer <b>CRAN)</b> is designed in this paper. In Multi-layer <b>CRAN,</b> a high-level edge cloud is deployed next to base band unit pool to handle the computing tasks of user equipment (UE) in centralized way. Meanwhile, a low-level edge cloud is deployed in each remote radio head (RRH) to locally handle UEs’ computing tasks in a distributed way. Based upon Multi-layer <b>CRAN,</b> a cooperative communication and computation resource allocation (3 C-RA) algorithm is further designed for lower service latency and energy cost, and higher network throughput in this paper. 3 C-RA utilizes a distributed RRH cell coloring algorithm to enable each RRH to work out the resource allocation in an efficient and distributed way. 3 C-RA employs a proportional fairness-based approach to allocate communication and computation resource in each RRH cell. A series of simulations on Multi-layer <b>CRAN</b> with 3 C-RA were carried out. The simulation results validate that Multi-layer <b>CRAN</b> is more capable of providing low-latency computing and communication services, and 3 C-RA enables Multi-layer <b>CRAN</b> to have lower service latency and energy cost and higher network throughput...|$|R

40|$|Building on {{scholarship}} from {{folklore and}} literature, everyday autobiography, women's traditional culture, and women's garden history, this thesis examines how Marion <b>Cran</b> documented home and garden experiences in Surrey and Kent {{through a series}} of gardening books she wrote between 1913 and 1941. [...] While providing useful information on plants and gardening practices, Cran's writing was fragmented and tangential: her books were filled with planting references suffused with culinary tips and recipes and traditional lore that evoked meaning and "encoded memories" (Kirshenblatt-Gimblett 1989). Although <b>Cran</b> was fascinated by garden styles indicative of the period, such as the English cottage garden, she also valued individuality in garden making, and implored her readers to create gardens that fulfilled their own expectations. [...] In her everyday autobiographies, <b>Cran</b> revealed her innermost thoughts based on her own experiences and what she learned through her observations of and interactions with fellow gardeners and homemakers. <b>Cran</b> inspired a predominantly female audience to create and maintain homes and gardens that benefited their own lives {{as well as those of}} their families and members of their communities. In direct correlation, women corresponded with <b>Cran,</b> confiding to her their own home and garden experiences whether they lived in England or South Africa. While exploring Cran's appeal to women readers, this thesis focuses on several themes: community and fellowship in gardening practices, implicit coding, female performativity, and women's sense of empowerment through creating a home and garden. [...] This thesis examines not only how <b>Cran</b> and her books inspired gardeners and homemakers' lives during the interwar period, but also, it recognizes her relevance to contemporary readers and present-day gardeners. Not unlike many gardeners today, <b>Cran</b> was committed to natural gardening practices and growing her own produce. <b>Cran</b> can be found not only between the pages of her books, but through the existence of her former home and garden, "Coggers," in Kent. By preserving Coggers and welcoming visitors, the current residents have fostered a growing community of readers and gardeners whose enthusiasm in <b>Cran</b> and her writings will continue her legacy for future generations. Marion <b>Cran</b> and her garden literature offer folklorists an alternative resource through which to understand and appreciate how women expressed themselves creatively through common, everyday tasks in homes and gardens of the early twentieth century...|$|R
