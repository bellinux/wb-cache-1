40|$|Abstract. In most {{approaches}} to stochastic inflation the noise term driving the dynamics {{is taken to}} be a white noise process. This white noise is closely linked to a step-function cutoff used to coarse-grain the inflaton field. Taking a different cutoff naturally leads to a <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> process. We study the effect of <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> on {{the dynamics of the}} inflaton, in particular, the resulting probability distributions. Furthermore, the corresponding stochastic differential equation of the inflaton is solved in a perturbative way...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{dynamics}} of a FitzHugh-Naguno system, driven by a periodic signal, {{in the presence of}} <b>coloured</b> <b>noise.</b> We consider the effects of the fluctuations by inserting in the deterministic FitzHugh-Nagumo model a term of additive Gaussian noise. We study the system in two different cases: the fluctuations affect {{the dynamics of}} the membrane potential (CASE I), the recovery variable is subjected to noise (CASE II). We review briefly the effects of the white noise, responsible for the appearance of resonant activation (RA) and noise enhanced stability (NES) phenomena. Afterwards we study the two cases {{in the presence of a}} <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> with correlation time tau. We investigate the effects of the <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> on the neuron dynamics for different values of the correlation time. We find that the positions both of the minimwn of RA and the maximwn of NES change as a function of tau...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new speech {{enhancement}} method that processes noise-corrupted speech in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) modulation domain. In contrast to the Fourier transform, the DCT produces a real-valued signal. Therefore, modulation-based processing in the DCT domain may allow both acoustic Fourier magnitude and phase information to be jointly estimated. Based on segmental SNR {{and the results of}} blind subjective listening tests on speech corrupted with various <b>coloured</b> <b>noises,</b> the application of the subspace method in the DCT modulation domain processing was found to outperform all other methods evaluated, including the LogMMSE method.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{low-cost}} landslide monitoring system using the Reverse Real-Time Kinematic (RRTK) technique. The server-based processing technique, which utilizes the two-way communication channel for the computation and {{transmission of the}} user’s accurate position, is discussed. The basic infrastructure requirements for RRTK in lowcost landslide monitoring application are described. In order to implement the proposed RRTK algorithm, real-time data streaming of raw Global Positioning System (GPS) data of both the reference and rover station(s) to the control centre, are performed. A high pass filtering technique was employed to detect outliers in the observations. Finally, the autocorrelation of GPS time series was investigated to validate the presence of white and <b>coloured</b> <b>noises</b> in the GPS observations...|$|R

Moreover, {{the performance of}} the detector under white noise is also presented. It is noticed that the filter bank detector in the existence of <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> follows quite accurately {{the performance of the}} white noise detector {{due to the fact that}} <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> support can be seamlessly integrated in the optimum detector. The small degradation is caused from the increase of the overall ambiguity due to the frequency selectivity of the noise.|$|E

The modulating Gaussian random signals are simulated by sums of sine waves of equally spaced frequencies and random phases. The FM signals filtered by the Bessel bandpass filter {{in front of the}} PLL FM demodulator are derived using the Fourier method and the <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> is obtained by the FFTbased filtering. The simulation is based on solving the nonlinear stochastic integrodifferential equation of the PLL FM demodulator subject to the distorted FM signals and <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> using a fast recurrent algorithm.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the steady-state properties {{of an active}} fluid modelled as an assembly of soft repulsive spheres subjected to Gaussian <b>coloured</b> <b>noise.</b> Such a noise captures one of the salient aspects of active particles, namely the persistence of their motion and determines a variety of novel features with respect to familiar passive fluids. We show that within the so-called multidimensional unified <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> approximation, recently introduced {{in the field of}} active matter, the model can be treated by methods similar to those employed in the study of standard molecular fluids. The system shows a tendency of the particles to aggregate even in the presence of purely repulsive forces because the combined action of <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> and interactions enhances the effective friction between nearby particles. We also discuss whether an effective two-body potential approach, which would allow to employ methods similar to those of density functional theory, is appropriate. The limits of such an approximation are discussed...|$|E

40|$|We {{formulate}} the stochastic {{dynamics of}} a particle subject to internal non-white (<b>coloured)</b> <b>noise</b> {{in terms of}} path-integrals. In the simplest case, where the noise is exponentially correlated, the weak-noise limit is characterised by optimum paths which are given by third order differential equations. In contrast to systems subject to white noise or external <b>coloured</b> <b>noise,</b> the overdamped limit for these systems is singular. We analyse {{the origin of this}} behaviour.

40|$|The {{correlation}} dimension D 2 and correlation entropy K 2 {{are both}} important quantifiers in nonlinear time series analysis. However, use of D 2 {{has been more}} common compared to K 2 as a discriminating measure. One {{reason for this is}} that D 2 is a static measure and can be easily evaluated from a time series. However, in many cases, especially those involving <b>coloured</b> <b>noise,</b> K 2 is regarded as a more useful measure. Here we present an efficient algorithmic scheme to compute K 2 directly from a time series data and show that K 2 can be used as a more effective measure compared to D 2 for analysing practical time series involving <b>coloured</b> <b>noise...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of an {{accurate}} computation and incorporation of <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> in radar altimeter data when computing a regional quasi-geoid model using least-squares techniques. Our test area comprises the Southern North Sea including the Netherlands, Belgium, and parts of France, Germany, and the UK. We perform the study by modelling the disturbing potential with spherical radial base functions. To that end, we use the traditional remove-compute-restore procedure with a recent GRACE/GOCE static gravity field model. Apart from radar altimeter data, we use terrestrial, airborne, and shipboard gravity data. Radar altimeter sea surface heights are corrected for the instantaneous dynamic topography and used {{in the form of}} along-track quasi-geoid height differences. Noise in these data are estimated using repeat-track and post-fit residual analysis techniques and then modelled as an auto regressive moving average process. Quasi-geoid models are computed with and without taking the modelled <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> into account. The difference between them is used as a measure of {{the impact of}} <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> in radar altimeter along-track quasi-geoid height differences on the estimated quasi-geoid model. The impact strongly depends on the availability of shipboard gravity data. If no such data are available, the impact may attain values exceeding 10 centimetres in particular areas. In case shipboard gravity data are used, the impact is reduced, though it still attains values of several centimetres. We use geometric quasi-geoid heights from GPS/levelling data at height markers as control data to analyse the quality of the quasi-geoid models. The quasi-geoid model computed using a model of the <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> in radar altimeter along-track quasi-geoid height differences shows in some areas a significant improvement over a model that assumes white noise in these data. However, the interpretation in other areas remains a challenge due to the limited quality of the control data. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a novel {{approach}} for speech signal enhancement is presented. This approach employs singular value decomposition (SVD) to overlook noise subspace and uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimally set the essential parameters. The method is elicited by analyzing the effects of environmental noises on the singular vectors {{as well as the}} singular values of clean speech signals. This article reviews the existing approaches for subspace estimation and proposes novel techniques for effectively enhancing the singular values and vectors of a noisy speech. This results in a considerable attenuation of the noise and retaining quality of the original speech. The efficiency of our proposed method is affected by a number of parameters which are optimally set by utilizing the GA. Extensive sets of experiments have been carried out on speech signals impaired by additive white Gaussian noise and/or different types of realistic <b>coloured</b> <b>noises.</b> The results of applying the six superior speech enhancement methods are compared using the objective (SNR) and subjective (PESQ) measures.

Noisy elements contribute in various ways to the overall noise eect. When dealing with free oscillators, phase noise is most important. In the case of white and <b>coloured</b> stochastic <b>noise</b> sources, the spectrum of the (stationary) autocorrelation of the phase shifted function can be determined by summing the eects of all independent noise sources.

An exception in the comparison of PD error over coloured and white noise is observed for SNR =- 6 dB when λsignal is lower than 0.4 and λnoise= 2.5. Figure 10 shows that error was maximized for SNR =- 6 dB. During the simulation tests for <b>coloured</b> <b>noise,</b> it was shown that the PFA error for high λnoise values is biased and the achieved PFA will be actually smaller than the targeted. Smaller PFA means increase of the PD value. This increase of the PD value counteracts with the biased PD error due to PS signal frequency selectivity. Therefore, in the specific case, the PD error of the <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> detector is smaller than the AWGN case.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Oesophageal speech, a mode {{of speech}} for laryngec-tomees, is of low quality and {{intelligibility}} comparative to normal (laryngeal) speech. Understanding the signal differences between oesophageal and normal speech will help future oesophageal speech enhancement methods. We aim to produce a method to synthesise oesophageal speech using a simple source–filter model. In this paper, we fit a parametric glottal waveform model to speech samples in our oesophageal database. (This glottal waveform represents the source component in the source–filter approach.) We added <b>coloured</b> <b>noise</b> to the glottal waveform model to produce realistic sounding oesophageal speech. Our fitting error measure, a spectral distance measure, reduces for all tested speech samples when adding the <b>coloured</b> <b>noise.</b> Yet missing from our synthesised signal is the rough-sounding quality often present in oesophageal speech.

40|$|Starting from a {{generalization}} of the quantum trajectory theory (based on the stochastic Schrödinger equation - SSE), non-Markovian models of quantum dynamics are derived. In order to describe non-Markovian effects, the approach {{used in this}} article is based on the introduction of random coefficients in the usual linear SSE. A major interest is that this allows to develop a consistent theory of quantum measurement in continuous time for these non-Markovian quantum trajectory models. In this context, the notions of instrument, a priori and a posteriori states are rigorously described. The key point is that by starting from a stochastic equation on the Hilbert space of the system, we are able to respect the complete positivity of the mean dynamics for the statistical operator and the requirements of the axioms of quantum measurement theory. The flexibility of the theory is next illustrated by a concrete physical model of a noisy oscillator where non Markovian effects come from random environment, <b>coloured</b> <b>noises,</b> randomness in the stimulating light, delay effects. The statistics of the emitted photons and the heterodyne and homodyne spectra are studied and we show how these quantities are sensible to the non-Markovian features of the system dynamics, so that, in principle, the observation and analysis of the fluorescence light could reveal the presence of non-Markovian effects and allow for a measure of the spectra of the noises affecting the system dynamics.

40|$|Chroma is a two-part, sound {{installation}} for six cassette players. The piece both builds upon {{approaches to}} the sculpting and framing of ‘surplus’ noise evidenced in liminal’s (Frances Crow and David Prior) Organ of Corti, but here, the focus moves from the acoustic mediation of environmental sound to {{an examination of the}} role of noise in recording media. The installation was made for the Paul Stolper Gallery, London. Contributing to the recent upsurge in both scholarship and practice on the theme of noise, Chroma juxtaposes the two meanings of the term – as unwanted sound and as a sound that has no discernable pitch – in dialogue with each other. Part one of the piece plays six ostensibly 'static' noise colours through six tape players.
