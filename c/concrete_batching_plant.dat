40|$|Recycling of {{construction}} material helps save the limited landfill space. Among {{various types of}} materials, concrete waste accounts of about 50 % of the total waste generation. Current off-site practices for ready mixed <b>concrete</b> <b>batching</b> <b>plant</b> generate a significant quantity of fresh concrete waste through over-order from construction sites. The use of concrete reclaimer {{is one of the}} methods to reclaim these concrete waste, which separates coarse aggregate, sand and cement from fresh concrete.

The reluctance of most concrete producers in reclaiming aggregate from the concrete waste is due to its high cost of treatment and lack of space around the plant. Therefore, this paper puts forth a scheme of economical considerations in recycling over-ordered concrete by concrete reclaimer. A comparative study on costs and benefits between the current practices and the proposed recycling plan is examined. The study shows that the costs of the current practices in dumping over-ordered fresh concrete waste to landfill areas are double that of the proposed aggregate recycling plan. Therefore, the adoption of concrete reclaimer in recycling the over-ordered fresh concrete can provide a cost-effective method for the construction industry and help saving the environment...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 22 nd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 14 - 16 July 2003 "National issues affecting the movement of people and goods - strategic approaches", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: Oxyfibre is {{a new type of}} surface chemically modified polypropylene fibre used to reinforce and improve the overall properties of concrete materials. The product is the first type of polypropylene fibre with a permanent modified wettable surface in the world and has the international patent in major regions in the world. Oxyfibre is an ideal reinforcement for concrete to improve the cracking resistance, impact resistance, toughness and durability of hardened concrete materials. When using in steel reinforced concrete structures, the fibres in concrete can help to reduce the corrosion rate of the steel reinforcement and thus prolong the service life of the concrete structures. Oxyfibre can be used with all the conventional concrete mixing procedures and mixing ratio. Oxyfibre can be added into concrete via hand mixing, all type of mechanical mixers, ready mix <b>concrete</b> <b>batching</b> <b>plant</b> and ready mix concrete truck. The fibres have found wide applications in construction industry, such as float foundation, concrete floor and pre-cast concrete components, etc. In transportation industries, Oxyfibre has already been successfully used in ordinary concrete road, farm road, parking lot, road side drainage, underground road way in mine and in sprayed concrete for tunnel and shaft lining to prevent rock blasting. In these applications, Oxyfibre is mainly used to replace the steel mesh and thus results in a reduction in material and labour cost.

40|$|Session CS 04 : Building and constructionConfenrence Theme: LCA {{in market}} {{research}} and policy: Harmonisation beyond standardisationIndustrialization {{of the construction}} process being a current trend can considerably reduce the on-site labor intensity and shorten the construction time. Prefabrication of construction components {{is one of the}} most commonly used methods to facilitate the industrialization in the sector. Since the mid- 1980 s, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) has begun to introduce prefabricated concrete components into public housing projects. While the provision of public housing is of paramount importance in Hong Kong as approximately 30 % of the population live in public rental housing (PRH) flats and 20 % reside in home ownership scheme (HOS) flats, prefabricated concrete components can replace some 17 % or 65 % in extremely cases of in-situ concrete casting by volume. Due to high labor cost and a lack of land in Hong Kong, prefabricated concrete units are mostly manufactured in mainland China and transported to the construction sites in Hong Kong. This leads to a more complicated logistic system when compared to the conventional cast-in-situ concrete method. The transportation of heavy prefabricated concrete units can generate pollutants and consequently compound the environmental burden. Nevertheless, using the prefabrication approach can help minimize on-site wastage. In this study, the environmental footprint of prefabricated and cast-in-situ concrete is compared using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. A software program known as the Environmental Modeling of Construction (EMoC) has been developed based upon the concept of LCA. EMoC considers the ‘cradle-to-site’ processes from raw material extraction, manufacturing of components, transportation to on-site construction processes. More importantly, the on-site activities related to prefabricated and cast-in-situ concrete can be evaluated separately. To facilitate comparison, the life cycle inventory of concrete has been collected from a local prefabrication yard and <b>concrete</b> <b>batching</b> <b>plant.</b> The comparison is based on the unit of 1 m 3 of unreinforced prefabricated concrete and the equivalent amount of cast-in-situ concrete. Through this study, it is found that the overall environmental footprint of prefabricated concrete as represented by the endpoint single score is 36 which is indeed much better than the score of 57 for cast-in-situ concrete. While cast-in-situ concrete contributes more to the toxicity, eutrophication, land occupation, and resource depletion than prefabricated concrete, the carbon footprint of prefabricated concrete is only 6 % less than that of cast-in-situ concrete. The analysis reveals that timber formwork is the primary contributor towards a larger environmental footprint of cast-in-situ concrete. The results show that prefabricated concrete can outweigh conventional cast-in-situ concrete from an environmental point of view due to a dramatic saving in the amount of temporary materials...|$|E
40|$|Building {{industry}} {{is one of}} the most influential economic sectors, which accounts for 10 % of the gross domestic product (GDP) globally and 40 % of the world energy consumption. To achieve the goal of sustainable development, it is necessary to understand the sustainability performance of building construction in the environmental, the economic and the social aspects. This study quantitatively evaluates impacts of building construction in the three aspects by using the recently developed life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) methodology, in which environmental life cycle assessment (ELCA), environmental life cycle costing (ELCC), and social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) are integrated. The scope of this research covers ‘cradle-to-site’ life cycle stages, from raw material extraction to on-site construction. Three life-cycle models are developed, namely the Environmental Model of Construction (EMoC), the Cost Model of Construction (CMoC), and the Social-impact Model of Construction (SMoC). EMoC is a comprehensive ELCA model that evaluates environmental impacts of building construction by considering eighteen impact categories. CMoC is an ELCC model that provides analyses on construction costs and externalities. SMoC is an innovative S-LCA model being able to quantify social impacts of building construction in thirteen social impact categories. The three models are then integrated into a newly proposed LCSA framework. In order to select an appropriate LCIA method for EMoC, the differences among existing life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods are investigated. It is found that LCIA methods are consistent in global impact categories, while inconsistent in regional impact categories. ‘ReCiPe’ is selected as the LCIA method to be used in EMoC. Midpoint and endpoint approaches of ‘ReCiPe’ can lead to different interpretations. Endpoint approach emphasizes on certain impact categories and can only be used when midpoint results are provided. A life cycle inventory is established for ready mixed concrete and precast concrete based on site-specific data from <b>concrete</b> <b>batching</b> <b>plant</b> and precast yard. EMoC is employed to compare environmental performance of precast and cast-in-situ construction methods. It is found that adoption of precast concrete can significantly improve environmental performance of building construction. SMoC suggests that adoption of precast concrete can have both negative and positive impacts on local employment. A case study is conducted to test the model performance. It demonstrates that environmental impacts of ‘cradle-to-site’ construction activities are mostly attributed to the material stage. The external cost due to carbon emission is about 2 % of the total construction cost. Environmental-friendly on-site construction practices can significantly improve social performance of building construction. The major findings of this study are verified through interviews with the local experts in Hong Kong. These validation interviews confirm that the proposed LCSA framework and the developed models contribute to the building industry in Hong Kong. In particular, this study can be used as a supplementary to the building assessment scheme, HK BEAM Plus. Results from this study can improve the understanding of building sustainability. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{supplementary}} cementitious materials (SCMs) {{in commercial}} construction have been increasing {{over the last}} several decades as climate change and sustainability has been gaining global attention. Incorporation of SCMs into concrete mixtures provides several environmental benefits. Since most SCMs are waste by-products of other industries, their use in concrete reduces waste disposal. Additionally, cements substitution with SCMs reduces the carbon footprint of the construction industry. Cement production generates large amounts of CO 2 emissions; the use of SCMs reduces the amount of cement in a concrete mixture thereby reducing emissions from its production. In addition to SCMs, modern concretes typically incorporate a combination of chemical admixtures. Adverse interaction of admixtures with cement, with or without the SCMs, or with each other {{is one of the most}} common reasons for early-age concrete issues. Since the possible combinations of admixtures are numerous and there is a variety of cements on the market, testing all possible chemical/mineral/cement admixture combinations is impractical. The aim of this research was to cover a broad base of admixture-related issues, each addressing a specific need of the construction industry. There is currently no explanation for why calcium chloride-based accelerator is not always effective when used with high tricalcium aluminate (C 3 A) cements. It was determined that increasing C 3 A or gypsum content alone did not appear to significantly affect acceleration; however, the presence of alkalis reduced the effectiveness of CaCl 2 accelerator. When CaCl 2 -based accelerators are used in concrete, they are typically used in combination with other chemical admixtures, such as water-reducing and retarding admixtures (WRRA) to allow for the use of a low water-cementitious material ratio. In order to avoid premature hardening, CaCl 2 accelerator is most often added onsite, rather than at the <b>concrete</b> <b>batching</b> <b>plant.</b> Onsite addition can lead to accidental overdose of accelerator. It was found that increasing dosages of calcium chloride-containing accelerating admixtures in the presence of WRRA has a non-linear effect on the pore size distribution and consequently a non-linear increase on the autogenous shrinkage, which can contribute to early-age concrete cracking. Water-reducing admixtures and superplasticizers are added to concrete to improve workability, which decreases not only with a decrease in water-cementitious material ratio, but also with addition of some SCMs. Silica fume and metakaolin are known to decrease workability; fly ash and slag addition improve it. The effect of SCM combinations on workability is typically assumed to be additive. However, this investigation revealed that combining SCMs does not have an additive effect on workability, measured in terms of apparent yield stress and plastic viscosity; consequently, these parameters cannot be estimated from their respective values. Cement replacement with SCMs affects not only workability, but also heat of hydration, and is commonly used to reduce concrete temperature rise in concrete. Prediction and control of concrete temperature rise due to cement hydration is of great significance for mass concrete structures since large temperature gradients between the surface and the core of the structure can lead to cracking thus reducing durability of the structure. A number of equations have been proposed to predict the heat of hydration of cement and cement/SCM blends. However, these equations do not include metakaolin, which is a relatively new mineral admixture. Based on statistical experimental design, an equation was developed to predict the reduction of total hydration heat at 24, 48 and 72 hours with addition of SCMs compared to a plain ordinary portland cement (OPC) -water mixture. The developed equation allows the evaluation of the contribution of Class F fly ash (FA), blast furnace slag (BFS), silica fume (SF) and metakaolin (MK) as well as their combinations. Since metakaolin has been on the market for only about 10 years, the current knowledge on its effect on hydration products and paste microstructure remains incomplete. The effect of MK on the nature of hydration products was evaluated through x-ray diffraction. Its effect on the microstructure was assessed by measuring porosity with nitrogen adsorption and determining nanoindentation modulus as well as the volume fraction of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) with variable packing densities. No significant effect was observed on the nature of hydration products with MK or BFS addition. However, nitrogen-accessible porosity increased with MK and BFS addition, the increase being larger with BFS. The average indentation modulus for the hydration products decreased with addition of MK and BFS, which corresponded to increasing nitrogen accessible pores. The results of this study indicate that phase quantification by quantitative x-ray diffraction (QXRD) of the hydrated paste may not be sufficient to assess the impact of metakaolin or BFS addition on the hydrating cementitious systems, and a multi-technique approach that provides information not only on the amount of hydration products, but also their morphology is preferable...|$|E
