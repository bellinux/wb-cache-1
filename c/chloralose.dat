50|$|The {{intravenous}} LD50 {{of the new}} alkaloid {{was approximately}} 150mg/kg for mice and 0.75 mg/kg for rabbits/ Before death, the mice showed periodic convulsions of a clonic type, erection of the hairs and excitability. At doses of 50-100mg/kg it produced only this peculiar symptomatology: the mice stood upright and pressed on each other's noses and chattered their teeth. In rabbits, and injection into the ear vein in doses of 0.1-1mg/kg produced dilatation of the pupil, excitability or convulsions of a clinic type. The ears became pale and cold with intense vasoconstriction. The toxicity of the alkaloid to rabbits seemed to depend on its power of raising the body-temperature in this species. In rabbits the similarity between {{the effects of the}} new alkaloid and ergometrine were particularly striking, but ergometrine was less toxic to rabbits (the approximate intravenous LD50 of ergometrine was 3.5mg/kg).D-lysergic acid methyl carbinolamide induced, in low concentrations (minimum active concentration 0.1-1µg/ml), a contracture in the isolated uterus of the virgen guinea pig. There was a satisfactory dose/response relationship. This contracture was very similar to that produced by ergmetrine maleate, which, however, was 1-2 times more potent.On the rabbit uterus in situ both alkaloids produced a prompt contraction and increased rhythmic activity of the uterus. For ergometrine the minimum active dose by intravenous route was 0.1-0.3 mg/kg and for the new alkaloid 0.2-0.5mg/kgm. The actions of both alkaloids lasted some minutes, and owing to the favourable circumstance that the interference between the effects of the two alkaloids was negligible, it was possible to test them on the same preparation. Ergometrine was 1-2 times more potent than the new alkaloid. On the isolated seminal vesicles of the guinea pig, the new alkaloid was approximately 200 times less potent than ergotamine tartrate as an adrenergic blocking drug. Rabbits anaethetized with urethane supported doses of D-lysergic acid methyl carbinolamide which would have killed unanaesthetized animals. Rapid intravenous injections of small doses (0.1-0.2mg/kg) of the new alkaloid caused an evanescent decrease or a small increase of blood pressure; with higher doses (0.3/0.5mg/kg and more) the blood pressure increased moderately without showing any dose/response relationship. Ergometrine maleate seemed to be less active on bloodpressure, and there was no significant change of blood pressure with 0.3-0.5 mg/kg.The new alkaloid was without effect, when given in small doses, on the blood pressure of cats anaethetized with <b>chloralose.</b> Higher intravenous doses (0.1-0.3mg/kg) caused a sustained hypotension of long duration and a moderate decrease of heart-rate. The respiration of rabbits and cats was depressed by small doses of the new alkaloid; cats seemed to be less resistant than rabbits. In cats, 0.01mg/kg of the new alkaloid caused broncho-constriction and contractions of the nictitating membrane of long duration. The new alkaloid have no action on isolated rabbit auricles at doses up to 100µg/ml. In summing up, the new naturally occurring alkaloid D-lysergic acid methyl carbinolamide has powerful ergometrine-like oxytocic action and weak ergotamine-like adrenergic blocking actions. It must be included, on the basis of pharmacological evidence, in the ergometrine group of ergot alkaloids. Ergometrine, however, is less toxic and more active than the new alkaloid. Results suggest that it could have a lysergic acid diethylamide-like activity, but this hypothesis must be checked by experiments on humans.|$|E

The formation of the isoprenaline-like compound was prevented by pretreatment with pyrogallol but not by pretreatment with reserpine, cocaine, phentolamine, dibenamine, harmaline, or iproniazid.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{establish}} whether or not cardiovascular responses following noradrenaline perfusions into the lateral cerebral ventricle might be correlated with cationic (Na+, Ca++, K+, Mg++) changes in the cerebrospinal fluid, blood pressure, ECG (Lead II), and heart rate changes were recorded before, during and after perfusions with artificial CSF alone and with added noradrenaline. These {{studies were carried out}} in vagotomized, <b>chloralosed,</b> artificially ventilated cats. Samples of the perfusates were collected at fixed intervals to analyze the cation concentrations. Perfusions with either CSF alone or low I-noradrenaline bitartrate (NA) concentrations produced no significant changes in either blood pressure, ECG or heart rate. Perfusions with higher concentrations of NA significantly increased blood pressure and K+ concentrations in the perfusates. Following pretreatment with various agents (reserpine, tranylcypromine, chlorpromazine and imipramine) similar NA perfusions induced no significant blood pressure changes and blocked the K+ effect seen with NA perfusions alone. Further pretreatment with chlorpromazine and imipramine significantly reduced blood pressure with a concomitant increase in Mg++ concentrations. It is concluded that centrally initiated noradrenaline blood pressure responses appear to involve K+ movements in the CNS and that the blood pressure responses following central pretreatment with chlorpromazine and imipramine involve Mg++ movements in the central nervous system...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} {{organization of the}} PRN of the cat medulla was studied in light of its potential role as an integrator of postural and cardiovascular afferent information. Neurons in {{a large number of}} afferent sites including the cerebellar deep nuclei, vestibular, accessory oculomotor and solitary nuclei, superior colliculus, bulbar reticular formation, cerebral cortex and spinal cord were retrogradely labeled with HRP following injection of the dorsal and ventral PRN. Collateral axonal projections of PRN neurons were studied with fluorescence histochemistry focusing on their cerebello- and spinopetal connections. About 50 % of PRN axons projecting to the ipsilateral anterior cerebellar lobe had collateral branches to the corresponding contralateral cortex. Similarly, 40 % of PRN neurons projecting to the region of the intermediolateral nucleus (IML) at and caudal to the T 2 level distributed collateral branches to the same region at and caudal to the T 4 and T 7 levels. The PRN was systematically explored for single units antidromically activated by electrical stimulation of the IML in <b>chloralosed,</b> paralyzed and artificially ventilated cats. Of 62 such PRN units, 40 % were found to respond orthodromically to electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve (CSN) and/or fastigial nucleus. Under similar anesthetic conditions, the region of the PRN was reexplored for single units orthodromically activated by electrical stimulation of the vestibular nuclear complex following chronic surgical ablation of the fastigioreticular input to the PRN. Of 47 such PRN units, 62 % could be antidromically activated by electrical stimulation of the IML, however, none responded orthodromically to CSN stimulation. All units found responsive to IML stimulation in both preparations were located mainly in the ventral PRN. These experiments provide anatomical and electrophysiological evidence of direct pathways from the PRN to the IML region which mediate cardiovascular and vestibular afferent information. In addition to their obvious role in motor regulation, projections of the motor cortex, accessory oculomotor nuclei, superior colliculus and bulbar reticular formation to the PRN may influence sympathetic activity through its connections with the IML region. These extensive connections and functional autonomic relations of the PRN suggest a central role in mediating orthostatic reflex activity...|$|R

40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging of mice requires that the physiology of the mouse (body temperature, respiration and heart rates, blood pH level) be maintained {{in order to prevent}} changes affecting the outcomes of functional scanning, namely blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) measures and cerebral blood flow (CBF). The anesthetic used to sedate mice for scanning can have major effects on physiology. While alpha <b>chloralose</b> has been commonly used for functional imaging of rats, its effects on physiology are not well characterized in the literature for any species. In this study, we anesthetized or sedated mice with isoflurane or alpha <b>chloralose</b> for up to two hours, and monitored physiological parameters and arterial blood gasses. We found that, when normal body temperature is maintained, breathing rates for both drugs decrease over the course of two hours. In addition, alpha <b>chloralose</b> causes a substantial drop in heart rate and blood pH with severe hypercapnia (elevated blood CO 2) that is not seen in isoflurane-treated animals.

The responses obtained with trans-(±) -ACPD were compared with the responses to L-glutamate (1 nmol/ 100 nl), since in a previous study we showed that anesthesia converted a pressor response to L-glutamate microinjected into the NTS of conscious rats to a depressor response in the same rats under urethane or <b>chloralose</b> anesthesia. Microinjection of 3 doses of trans-(±) -ACPD (100, 500 and 1000 pmol/ 100 nl) produced a dose-dependent fall in MAP (range, - 20 to - 50 mmHg) and HR (range, - 30 to - 170 bpm) under both conscious and <b>chloralose</b> anesthesia conditions.

40|$|Hemodynamic and {{metabolic}} {{consequences of}} a 90 -minute period of liver ischemia followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion were studied in rats that were awake {{during most of the}} experiment and in rats anesthetized with either pentobarbital (40 mg/kg body weight) or <b>chloralose</b> (30 mg/kg X hour) during the complete length of the experiment. Ischemia was induced by occluding the blood vessels to the left and median liver lobes with a small vascular clamp, which was removed after 90 minutes. Protein synthesis rate was determined by measuring incorporation rate of 14 C-leucine into protein in incubated liver slices. At the end of the ischemic period, adenosine triphosphate levels in liver tissue and protein synthesis rate were reduced by 80 % to 90 %, with no significant differences among groups. During reperfusion, energy levels and protein synthesis rate remained depressed in the anesthetized animals, but improved, although not to normal values, in the awake rats. Hepatic tissue water increased during ischemia, probably reflecting hepatocellular membrane injury. The increase in hepatic tissue water was more pronounced in the <b>chloralose</b> group than in the other groups of rats. During reperfusion hepatic tissue water remained increased in the anesthetized rats but was normalized in the awake group. Mean arterial blood pressure was stable during ischemia and reperfusion in the pentobarbital anesthetized rats, while a progressive decrease in blood pressure during the experiment was noted in the <b>chloralose</b> group. The results suggest that hemodynamic and metabolic responses to liver ischemia and reperfusion can be influenced by anesthetics. <b>Chloralose</b> may be less suitable than pentobarbital for anesthesia when liver ischemia is inflicted...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{used the}} phase {{modulated}} rotating frame imaging technique to measure transmural distribution of phosphorus metabolites in 10 anaesthetised ventilated pigs using a double surface coil {{placed on the}} surface of the left ventricle. Anaesthesia was maintained in five animals with halothane, barbiturate and nitrous oxide and in five others with intravenous <b>chloralose.</b> 31 Phosphorus spectra were acquired, gated to expiration and systole. From phantom experiments the resolution of the experiment was shown to be approximately 2 mm. The anatomical limits of the myocardium were identified by the appearance of 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate peaks from red blood cells. The limits of the epicardium were confirmed by obtaining images after placing a phantom containing flurophosphate {{on the surface of}} the heart. The endocardium was identified by inserting a small balloon catheter through the centre of the coil into the left ventricular cavity, filling it with 0. 5 ml of fluorophosphate and pulling it gently against the endocardium. No transmural differences in phosphocreatine to ATP ratio were identified in the normal heart. The animals anaesthetised with <b>chloralose</b> showed a significantly higher phosphocreatine to ATP ratio compared to those anaesthetised with halothane and barbiturate.

40|$|In cats, tremor {{produced}} by intraperitoneal pentobarbitone sodium or by intramuscular chlorpromazine was abolished by injection into the cerebral ventricles {{of a few}} gamma of adrenaline or noradrenaline, but not of other sympathomimetic amines or of anti-Parkinsonian drugs. <b>Chloralose,</b> urethane, calcium chloride, and magnesium chloride produced anti-tremor activity when administered in this way.

40|$|The {{actions of}} hydroxydione sodium succinate (“Viadril”) {{have been studied}} in <b>chloralose</b> or decerebrate cats, or cats {{otherwise}} untreated.

In the present study, the potential interactions of bepridil with volatile anesthetics on cardiac electrophysiologic parameters were evaluated] in open-chest dogs. Twenty-four dogs anesthetized with enflurane (n = 6), halothane (n = 6), isoflurane (n = 6), or <b>chloralose</b> (n = 6) received 2. 5 mg/kg of bepridil intravenously (IV). Twenty-five additional dogs anesthetized with enflurane (n = 7), halothane (n = 6), isoflurane (n = 6), or <b>chloralose</b> (n = 6), received bepridil, 5. 0 mg/kg, IV. Dogs anesthetized with cloralose served as controls. Cardiac electrophysiologic parameters were measured after {{the dogs were}} anesthetized and were repeated 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after bepridil infusion. Plasma bepridil concentrations were also determined at the above time points. Synergy between bepridil and enflurane was demonstrated in the following cardiac electrophysiologic parameters: depression of sinus node function as evidenced by severe depression of sinus node automaticity and conduction; depression of atrioventricular function as evidenced by prolongation of the atrial [...] His bundle interval and the Wenckebach R-R interval; and, prolongation of the atrial effective refractory period.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{which part of}} the parasympathetic bronchoconstrictor pathway is most sensitive to depression by general anesthetics, we stimulated {{different parts of the}} pathway in dogs after initial anesthesia with <b>chloralose</b> and urethan and then after additional anesthetic drugs. We stimulated the entire reflex pathway by producing apnea or hypoventilation, the sensory pathway by electrically stimulating the proximal end of cut superior laryngeal nerves, and the motor pathway by stimulating the distal end of a cut cervical vagus nerve. Bronchoconstrictor responses to all stimuli were assessed with a bypassed tracheal segment. When no additional anesthetic was administered, responses to all stimuli increased with time. Small additional doses of anesthetics (thiopental, 1 - 5 mg/kg; pentobarbital, 1 - 2 mg/kg; amobarbital, 1 - 2 mg/kg; or <b>chloralose,</b> 10 mg/kg) decreased responses to reflex and sensory stimulation markedly and reversibly, but they did not affect responses to motor stimulation.

40|$|Autoregulation, an {{important}} feature of the cerebral circulation, is affected in many diseases. Since genetically modified mice are a fundamental tool in biomedical research, including neuro(bio) logy also in this specie measurements of cerebral autoregulation (CA) are mandatory. However, this requires anesthesia that unfortunately significantly impacts cerebral perfusion and consequently might distort CA measurements directly or by altering arterial pCO(2). The latter can be avoided by artificial ventilation but requires several control measurements of blood gases, each consuming at least 100 μl of blood or 5 % of a mouse's blood volume. To avoid such diagnostic hemorrhage, we systematically analyzed the effect of different common anesthetic protocols used for rodents in spontaneously breathing mice on CA measured with Laser speckle perfusion imaging. Halothane, Isoflurane and Pentobarbital abrogated CA and Ketamin/Xylazine as well as <b>Chloralose</b> had a moderate reproducibility.

40|$|SUMMARY Angiotensin II, {{when given}} into the {{vertebral}} arteries, acts at the area postrema to augment central sympathetic vasomotor activity. The {{mechanism of action}} is unknown but recent evidence implicates an interaction with the opiate system. In dogs anesthetized with <b>chloralose</b> either alone or in combination with morphine, naloxone blunted the pressor response to vertebrally administered angiotensin II by 50 %. Addition of morphine to dogs anesthetized with <b>chloralose</b> only doubled the pressor response to identical doses of angiotensin II. On the other hand, {{the magnitude of the}} pressor responses to intravenously infused angiotensin II were unaltered by either naloxone or morphine. Likewise, responses to noreplnephrine given vertebrally and intravenously were not similarly affected. Therefore, naloxone-induced changes in vascular responsiveness were not responsible for the altered sensitivity of the area postrema to angiotensin II following blockade of en-dogenous opiates. The data suggest that there exists a previously unrecognized interaction of the endogenous opiate system in the medulla in mediating the pressor effects of angiotensin II {{at the level of the}} area postrema.

The protective effect of bradykinin on reperfusion-induced VF was not affected by L-NAME. These results strongly suggest that the antiarrhythmic effect of bradykinin in this model is mediated by nitric oxide release. It also supports the concept that bradykinin might be a 'primary mediator' of the protective, antiarrhythmic effects of ischemic preconditioning...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the contribution of}} endogenous prostanoids to baroreceptor activation in chronic renal hypertension. Barore-ceptor activity was recorded from the vascularly isolated ca-rotid sinus during slow ramp increases in pressure in rabbits anesthetized with pentothal and <b>chloralose.</b> Mean arterial pressure averaged 133 ± 4 mmHg in hypertensive rabbits (one kidney, one wrap, n = 12) and 85 ± 3 mmHg in normotensive rabbits (one kidney, no wrap, n = 13). Baroreceptor activity was decreased significantly (P < 0. 05) in the hypertensive compared with the normotensive rabbits. The decreased baro-receptor activity could not be explained by decreased distensi-bility of the carotid sinus (sonomicrometers). Inhibition of the endogenous formation of prostanoids with intrasinus adminis-tration of indomethacin (50. M) decreased baroreceptor activ...|$|E
40|$|In anaesthetized cats leptazol (200 mg/ml) {{and sodium}} {{pentobarbitone}} (30 mg/ml) were applied topically {{to an area}} of the exposed ventral surface of the medulla oblongata, which lies between the rootlets of the twelfth cranial and first cervical nerve. The drugs were applied either bilaterally by means of paired Perspex rings or unilaterally by means of a single Perspex ring. Their effects on arterial blood pressure, heart rate and respiration were examined during two stages of anaesthesia, during 'surgical anaesthesia' produced by an intravenous injection of <b>chloralose</b> at 60 mg/kg, and during deeper anaesthesia attained by two additional intravenous injections of <b>chloralose</b> at 30 mg/kg. Both the bilateral and unilateral application of leptazol produced a fall in arterial blood pressure during surgical anaesthesia, but a rise during deepened anaesthesia. After a preceding topical application of sodium pentobarbitone the fall became attenuated or abolished, whereas the rise became potentiated. Sodium pentobarbitone itself affected blood pressure as well as respiration when applied bilaterally. It then produced pronounced tachypnoea independent of the depth of anaesthesia and a fall in arterial blood pressure during deepened anaesthesia. Its unilateral application did not affect respiration, nor did it affect usually arterial blood pressure, although during deepened anaesthesia it occasionally produced a fall in blood pressure. The area from which the pressor response to leptazol was obtained lay 7 - 11 mm caudal to the lower border of the trapezoid bodies, i. e. about 2 mm more caudally than the 'nicotine-sensitive area' from which a depressor response to leptazol is evoked. Thus the two areas, though not identical, overlap. The result obtained with sodium pentobarbitone suggest that the area for the pressor response to leptazol plays a role in maintaining vasomotor tone during deepened anaesthesia and exerts a strong inhibitory effect on the respiratory rate during both surgical and deepened anaesthesia...|$|E
40|$|MAN. Anesthetic {{depression}} of microcirculation, central he-modynamics, and respiration in decerebrate rats. Am. J. Phys-iol. 243 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 12) : H 837 -H 843, 1982. -The ob-jectives {{of this study}} were the development of a skeletal muscle microcirculatory preparation, in which the complications of drug anesthesia were minimized, and the quantitation of the effects of urethan and <b>chloralose</b> anesthesia on the microcircu-lation. Rats were initially anesthetized with urethan and chlor-alose and decerebrated by a midcollicular transection. The cremaster skeletal muscle, with intact circulation and innerva-tion, was prepared for intravital microscopy by placement in a tissue bath. Arterioles (9 - 70 pm diam) at several anatomic levels were observed during the initial period of urethan-chlor-alose anesthesia (period 1), after recovery from the anesthesia (period 2), and again following reanesthetization (period 3) ...|$|E
