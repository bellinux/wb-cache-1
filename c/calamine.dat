5|$|The {{manufacture}} of brass {{was known to}} the Romans by about 30BC. They made brass by heating powdered <b>calamine</b> (zinc silicate or carbonate), charcoal and copper together in a crucible. The resulting <b>calamine</b> brass was then either cast or hammered into shape for use in weaponry. Some coins struck by Romans in the Christian era are made of what is probably <b>calamine</b> brass.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide as {{a mixture}} with about 0.5% iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) is called <b>calamine</b> {{and is used}} in <b>calamine</b> lotion. Two minerals, zincite and hemimorphite, have been {{historically}} called <b>calamine.</b> When mixed with eugenol, a ligand, zinc oxide eugenol is formed, which has applications as a restorative and prosthodontic in dentistry.|$|E
5|$|German chemist Andreas Marggraf {{normally}} gets {{credit for}} discovering pure metallic zinc, even though Swedish chemist Anton von Swab had distilled zinc from <b>calamine</b> four years previously. In his 1746 experiment, Marggraf heated {{a mixture of}} <b>calamine</b> and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal. This procedure became commercially practical by 1752.|$|E
5|$|In 1738 in Great Britain, William Champion {{patented}} {{a process}} to extract zinc from <b>calamine</b> in a vertical retort style smelter. His technique resembled that used at Zawar zinc mines in Rajasthan, but no evidence suggests he visited the Orient. Champion's process was used through 1851.|$|E
5|$|William Champion's brother, John, {{patented}} {{a process}} in 1758 for calcining zinc sulfide into an oxide usable in the retort process. Prior to this, only <b>calamine</b> {{could be used to}} produce zinc. In 1798, Johann Christian Ruberg improved on the smelting process by building the first horizontal retort smelter. Jean-Jacques Daniel Dony built a different kind of horizontal zinc smelter in Belgium that processed even more zinc.|$|E
5|$|Zinc was {{distinctly}} {{recognized as}} a metal under the designation of Yasada or Jasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala (of Taka dynasty) and written about the year 1374. Smelting and extraction of impure zinc by reducing <b>calamine</b> with wool and other organic substances was accomplished in the 13th century in India. The Chinese did not learn of the technique until the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{isolation}} of metallic zinc in the West {{may have been}} achieved independently by several people in the 17th century. German chemist Andreas Marggraf is usually given credit for discovering pure metallic zinc in a 1746 experiment by heating a mixture of <b>calamine</b> and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal. Experiments on frogs by the Italian doctor Luigi Galvani in 1780 with brass {{paved the way for}} the discovery of electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection. In 1880, Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, invented the Voltaic pile. The biological importance of zinc was not discovered until 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} or post-medieval period, {{the remains of}} the hillfort were used as a rabbit warren which was used to breed rabbits, {{providing}} valuable meat and fur. Many warrens were surrounded by banks or walls to prevent the rabbits from escaping; escaped rabbits caused damage to nearby farmland and meant a loss in profit. The warren at Dolebury is completely enclosed by the substantial ramparts of the Iron Age hill fort and thus provided an ideal location to breed rabbits. The presence of pillow mounds and vermin traps demonstrate man's management of the site for husbandry. Ridge and furrow agriculture has also been identified, from aerial photographs, within the fort. Some of these structures, along with earlier Iron Age features, have been damaged by subsequent quarrying which may have been for lead, ochre or <b>calamine.</b> The site was described by John Leland in the 16th century. A three-storey building, believed to be the warrener's house and possibly a watch tower, surrounded by a garden, was in ruins by 1830.|$|E
5|$|Refinement of sulfidic {{zinc ores}} {{produces}} {{large volumes of}} sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La <b>Calamine</b> and Plombières between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes {{per year in the}} 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20to1.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{compounds}} {{were probably}} used by early humans, in processed and unprocessed forms, as a paint or medicinal ointment, but their composition is uncertain. The use of pushpanjan, probably zinc oxide, as a salve for eyes and open wounds, is {{mentioned in the}} Indian medical text the Charaka Samhita, thought to date from 500 BC or before. Zinc oxide ointment is also mentioned by the Greek physician Dioscorides (1st century AD.) Avicenna mentions zinc oxide in The Canon of Medicine (1025 AD), which mentioned it as a preferred treatment {{for a variety of}} skin conditions, including skin cancer. Though it is no longer used for treating skin cancer, it is still widely used to treat a variety of other skin conditions, in products such as baby powder and creams against diaper rashes, <b>calamine</b> cream, anti-dandruff shampoos, and antiseptic ointments.|$|E
25|$|About 1562 Bulmer {{founded the}} lead and <b>calamine</b> mines in the Mendip Hills near Chewton, Somerset. The Mendip ores (<b>calamine</b> and galena) were used by Christopher Schutz from 1565–86 at the smelter newly {{constructed}} by the Company of Mineral and Battery Works at Tintern. According to Baldwin, Bulmer was also 'on the fringes' of the smelting operations at Dartford in which Schutz refined tons of worthless ore brought from Baffin Island in 1576-8 by Martin Frobisher.|$|E
25|$|Kranich {{is said to}} have {{collaborated with}} Christopher Schutz in {{developing}} the use of <b>calamine</b> lotion in the treatment of burns from the furnaces used in smelting.|$|E
25|$|The substrata contain rich mineral {{deposits}} {{and so there}} were zinc and lead mines in the area. The Singing River Mine was worked in the 18th and 19th centuries for <b>calamine</b> (zinc carbonate), blende (zinc sulphide) and galena (lead sulphide).|$|E
25|$|As {{a reward}} for his work at Tintern, Schutz was granted denization on 9 April 1568, but the {{extraction}} of <b>calamine</b> ore at Worle Hill proved prohibitively expensive {{for the production of}} brass, and on 28 May the Company of Mineral and Battery Works, a newly incorporated joint stock company in which both Humfrey and Schutz held shares together with many influential members of the English court and government, took over the operation of the furnace, and converted it to the production of iron wire. A by-product of Schutz' first venture was the use of <b>calamine</b> lotion in the treatment of burns from furnaces, which Schutz developed with Burchard Kranich, another German-born metallurgist and one of the Queen's physicians.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Schutz, born in Annaberg, Saxony, {{was the son}} of Christoph Schutz (born 1505) of Chemnitz. His mother's name is unknown. He {{learned his}} craft in mines in the Erzgebirge. About 1563 he {{received}} an invitation to work in England. William Humfrey (d.1579), who had been appointed Assay Master at the Royal Mint in 1561, needed someone knowledgeable about <b>calamine</b> ore, used in the production of latten and brass, and paid Schutz' way to England. In 1564 Schutz, aided by twenty German-speaking workers, built England's first blast furnace at Tintern. In a letter of 16 August 1565 to Sir William Cecil, Humfrey stated that Schutz was 'bound in £10,000 to communicate his art in working metals', and requested that he and Schutz be granted a joint patent. In September 1565 Humfrey and Schutz were granted licences to prospect for <b>calamine</b> in England and in the Pale in Ireland, and to mine and process the ore, being joined in some of their licences with Thomas Smythe, William Williams and Humfrey Cole. Only a few months later, in early 1566, William Humfrey and Schutz found <b>calamine</b> in the Mendip Hills, and Daniel Hoechstetter designed a refining process by which it could be used in Schutz' furnace at Tintern.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s it {{was used}} as an {{underground}} reservoir by the water authorities. A small stream flows through the mine in parts. The entrance is actually in the back garden of a private house but access is allowed for potholers. The 5-metre high 19th-century <b>calamine</b> processor is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there have}} been no formal {{clinical}} studies evaluating the effectiveness of topical application of <b>calamine</b> lotion (a topical barrier preparation containing zinc oxide, {{and one of the most}} commonly used interventions), it has an excellent safety profile. It is important to maintain good hygiene and daily cleaning of skin with warm water to avoid secondary bacterial infection. Scratching may also increase the risk of secondary infection.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, mining {{companies}} exploited the island's Zinc-lead rich <b>calamine</b> ores, with a yield of around 2 million tonnes, and a processing plant at Limenaria produced zinc oxide. Iron ore was mined on a significant scale from 1954 to 1964, with a yield of around 3 million tonnes. Since 1964, surveys have established {{the existence of}} a deep-level zinc-lead deposit, but the only mining activity on the island has been marble quarrying.|$|E
25|$|Smithson's {{research}} work was eclectic. He studied subjects ranging from coffee making {{to the use}} of <b>calamine,</b> eventually renamed smithsonite, in making brass. He also studied the chemistry of human tears, snake venom and other natural occurrences. Smithson would publish twenty-seven papers. He was nominated to the Royal Society of London by Henry Cavendish and was made a fellow on 26 April 1787. Smithson socialised and worked with scientists Joseph Priestley, Sir Joseph Banks, Antoine Lavoisier, and Richard Kirwan.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} mining on {{the island}} has been dated to around 13,000 BC, when paleolithic miners dug a shaft {{at the site of}} the modern-era Tzines iron mine for the extraction of limonitic ochre. Mining for base and precious metals started around the 7th century BC with the Phoenicians, followed in the 4th century by the Greeks, then the Romans. These later mines were both open-cast and underground, mostly to exploit the island's numerous karst hosted <b>calamine</b> deposits for their lead and silver. Gold, copper and iron were also found; the Byzantines quarried marble {{on the island}}.|$|E
25|$|The {{varicella}} vaccine {{has resulted in}} a {{decrease in the number of}} cases and complications from the disease. It protects about 70 to 90 percent of people from disease with a greater benefit for severe disease. Routine immunization of children is recommended in many countries. Immunization within three days of exposure may improve outcomes in children. Treatment of those infected may include <b>calamine</b> lotion to help with itching, keeping the fingernails short to decrease injury from scratching, and the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) to help with fevers. For those at increased risk of complications antiviral medication such as aciclovir are recommended.|$|E
500|$|Cadmium (Latin cadmia, Greek καδμεία meaning [...] "calamine", a cadmium-bearing {{mixture of}} {{minerals}} that {{was named after}} the Greek mythological character Κάδμος, Cadmus, the founder of Thebes) was discovered simultaneously in 1817 by Friedrich Stromeyer and Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann, both in Germany, as an impurity in zinc carbonate. Stromeyer found the new element as an impurity in zinc carbonate (<b>calamine),</b> and, for 100 years, Germany remained the only important producer of the metal. The metal was named after the Latin word for <b>calamine,</b> because it was found in this zinc ore. Stromeyer noted that some impure samples of <b>calamine</b> changed color when heated but pure <b>calamine</b> did not. He was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by roasting and reducing the sulfide. The potential for cadmium yellow as pigment was recognized in the 1840s, {{but the lack of}} cadmium limited this application.|$|E
500|$|It {{is used in}} {{products}} such as baby powder and barrier creams to treat diaper rashes, <b>calamine</b> cream, anti-dandruff shampoos, and antiseptic ointments. It is also a component in tape (called [...] "zinc oxide tape") used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.|$|E
500|$|These {{areas were}} {{the centre of}} a major mining industry; this is {{reflected}} in areas of contaminated rough ground known locally as [...] "gruffy"; the word [...] "gruffy" [...] is thought to derive from the closely packed shafts that were sunk to extract lead ore from veins near the surface. <b>Calamine,</b> manganese, iron, copper and barytes were also mined.|$|E
500|$|In 1817, cadmium was {{discovered}} in Germany as an impurity in zinc carbonate minerals (<b>calamine)</b> by Friedrich Stromeyer and Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann. It was named after the Latin cadmia for [...] "calamine", a cadmium-bearing mixture of minerals, which was in turn named after the Greek mythological character, Κάδμος Cadmus, the founder of Thebes. Stromeyer eventually isolated cadmium metal by roasting and reduction of the sulfide.|$|E
500|$|The name of {{the metal}} was {{probably}} first documented by Paracelsus, a Swiss-born German alchemist, who referred to the metal as [...] "zincum" [...] or [...] "zinken" [...] in his book Liber Mineralium II, in the 16th century. The word is probably derived from the German , and supposedly meant [...] "tooth-like, pointed or jagged" [...] (metallic zinc crystals have a needle-like appearance). Zink could also imply [...] "tin-like" [...] because of its relation to German zinn meaning tin. Yet {{another possibility is that}} the word is derived from the Persian word [...] seng meaning stone. The metal was also called Indian tin, tutanego, <b>calamine,</b> and spinter.|$|E
500|$|In {{some areas}} the {{limestone}} and the dolomitic conglomerate have been mineralised with {{lead and zinc}} ores. From the time of Roman Britain until 1908, the hills were {{an important source of}} lead. These areas were the centre of a major mining industry in the past and this is reflected in areas of contaminated rough ground known locally as [...] "gruffy". The word [...] "gruffy" [...] is thought to derive from the grooves that were formed where the lead ore was extracted from veins near the surface. Other commodities obtained included <b>calamine</b> (zinc ore), manganese, iron, copper and baryte. The eastern area reaches into parts of the Somerset Coalfield.|$|E
500|$|The {{result was}} a {{substantial}} influx of money that in turn encouraged the import of manufactured luxury goods; by 1391 shipments from abroad routinely included [...] "ivory, mirrors, , armour, paper..., painted clothes, spectacles, tin images, razors, <b>calamine,</b> treacle, sugar-candy, marking irons, patens..., ox-horns and quantities of wainscot". Imported spices now formed a part of almost all noble and gentry diets, with the quantities being consumed varying according to {{the wealth of the}} household. The English government was also importing large quantities of raw materials, including copper, for manufacturing weapons. Many major landowners tended to focus their efforts on maintaining a single major castle or house rather than the dozens a century before, but these were usually decorated much more luxurious than previously. Major merchants' dwellings, too, were more lavish than in previous years.|$|E
500|$|During the Middle Ages and {{industrial}} revolution the area which now forms The Downs {{was used as}} common grazing land. It was mined for lead, <b>calamine,</b> iron and limestone, and became home to a windmill which produced snuff from the tobacco which {{had become one of}} the city's principal imports. In 1777 the windmill burnt out in a storm, and the building was converted into the observatory, which houses a camera obscura. In the 18th and 19th centuries Bristol's economy boomed and Clifton became a desirable place to live. Mansion houses were built overlooking the gorge, but after grazing was stopped, trees grew and obscured the view from these mansions. In the Victorian era, with houses creeping further onto the Downs, an Act of Parliament was passed to protect them as a park for the people of Bristol. In 1754 a bridge to span the gorge was proposed, but it was nearly 80years before work began on Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, and a further 30years before it was completed. [...] Today the bridge is perhaps the best known landmark in Bristol.|$|E
500|$|The Dioscorides {{translator}} {{and editor}} Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that [...] "For almost two millennia Dioscorides {{was regarded as}} the ultimate authority on plants and medicine", and that he [...] "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully." [...] To illustrate this, she states that [...] "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, henbane, and squill". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as [...] "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients... ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white horehound, and couch grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic." [...] She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and <b>calamine</b> also remain in use, while [...] "Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice". She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen {{may be explained by}} the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, she observes that [...] "A few superstitious practices are recorded in De Materia Medica," [...] such as using Echium as an amulet to ward off snakes, or Polemonia (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings.|$|E
2500|$|The castle {{was ruined}} and {{abandoned}} by the 1540s, with the stone being reused to build local houses. The site was mined extensively between the 17th and 19th centuries for lead and <b>calamine,</b> used at the foundries at Bristol. Today the site is a scheduled monument, [...] and a small fragment of the keep can still {{be seen on the}} site.|$|E
2500|$|His first {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the Royal Society on 7 July 1791, [...] "An Account of Some Chemical Experiments on Tabasheer." [...] Tabasheer is a substance used in traditional Indian medicine and derived from material collected inside bamboo culms. The samples that Macie analysed had been sent by Patrick Russell, physician-naturalist in India. In 1802 he read his second paper, [...] "A Chemical Analysis of Some Calamines," [...] at the Royal Society. It was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London and was the documented instance of his new name, James Smithson. In the paper, Smithson challenges the idea that the mineral <b>calamine</b> is an oxide of zinc. His discoveries made <b>calamine</b> a [...] "true mineral." [...] He explored and examined Kirkdale Cave; his findings, published in 1824, successfully challenged previous beliefs that the fossils within the formations at the cave were from the Great Flood. Smithson is credited with first using the word [...] "silicates". Smithson's bank records at C. Hoare & Co show extensive and regular income derived from Apsley Pellatt, which suggests that Smithson had a strong financial or scientific relationship with the Blackfriars glass maker.|$|E
2500|$|According to an Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet: ...After {{returning}} from a chigger-infested area, launder the field clothes in soapy, hot water (125°F.) ....As soon as possible, take a good hot bath or shower and soap repeatedly. The chiggers may be dislodged, but you will still have the stylostomes, causing the severe itch. Scratching deep to remove stylostomes can cause secondary infections. For temporary relief of itching, apply ointments of benzocaine, hydrocortisone, <b>calamine</b> lotion, New Skin, After Bite, or others recommended by your pharmacist or medical doctor. Some use Vaseline, cold cream, baby oil, or fingernail polish. (The sooner the treatment, the better the results.)....|$|E
2500|$|Between 4:00am and 5:00am on December 21, and December 30, 2000 (while Space Ghost Coast to Coast was on hiatus), {{several new}} Williams Street series made unannounced [...] "stealth" [...] premieres. Sealab 2021, Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law, Aqua Teen Hunger Force and The Brak Show all premiered unannounced; the {{official}} schedules listed the shows as [...] "Special Programming". Prior {{to that in}} Entertainment Weekly [...] it stated that Michael Ouweleen's next project {{was working on the}} Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law Pilot with J.J. Sedelmaier.

2500|$|Red wasp {{stingers}} do {{not remain}} in their victims. A red wasp sting is often painful and causes localized swelling and itchiness. In some cases, people report developing a full-body, itchy rash. Applying a cold compress or ice to the area can help relieve swelling, while application of <b>calamine</b> lotion or 1% hydrocortisone cream can help relieve itching and pain. [...] If neither of these creams is available, a paste made from baking soda and water is an effective sting remedy. The paste should be thick enough {{to stay on the}} area of the sting until it dries. Some individuals are known to have severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, to wasp stings, so should seek immediate medical attention if severe symptoms begin to present. In very rare cases, children may develop shock after a red wasp sting.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, German deep mining {{technology}} was in enormous demand all over Europe and German miners were licensed {{to live and}} work in Elizabethan England particularly in the Stannaries of Devon & Cornwall and in Cumbria. In other parts of England the technique was used in Elizabeth's royal mines [...] for <b>calamine</b> and by 1638 German miners were recorded using the technique in silver mines in Wales. It is thought that the dialect term [...] "dowsing" [...] was introduced at this period – its origin is unknown but features characteristics of the West Country dialects. In the lead-mining area of the Mendip Hills in Somerset in the 17th century the natural philosopher Robert Boyle, inspired by the writings of Agricola, watched a [...] practitioner try to find [...] "latent veins of metals". Boyle saw the hazel divining rod ("virgula divinatoria") stoop {{in the hands of the}} diviner, who protested that he was not applying any force to the twig; Boyle accepted the man's genuine belief [...] but himself remained unconvinced.|$|E
