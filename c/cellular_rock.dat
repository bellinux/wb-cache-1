With more than 200 species, this flora includes a large number (42) of endemic species of various degrees. Some species are known from only one site, many are located on neighbouring outcrops, others occur on all the ore deposits. Present migratory pathways have been traced for some species and are reported. The relative importance of palaeoendemism and neoendemism is discussed. The origin of these endemics, {{as well as that of}} other plants is to be found in several adjacent floras such as that of steppe-savannas developed on more or less poorly aerated soils (Kalahari sands or dambos overlaying laterite), dwarf vegetation on siliceous <b>cellular</b> <b>rocks</b> and miombo woodlands on poor hydromorphic soils.

40|$|To {{initiate}} infection, equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV- 1) {{attaches to}} heparan sulfate on cell surfaces and then interacts with a putative glycoprotein D receptor(s). After attachment, virus entry occurs either by direct fusion {{of the virus}} envelope with the plasma membrane or via endocytosis followed by fusion between the virus envelope and an endosomal membrane. Upon fusion, de-enveloped virus particles are deposited into the cytoplasm and travel to the nucleus for viral replication. In this report, we examined the mechanism of EHV- 1 intracellular trafficking and investigated the ability of EHV- 1 to utilize specific cellular components to efficiently travel to the nucleus post-entry. Using a panel of microtubule-depolymerizing drugs and inhibitors of microtubule motor proteins, we show that EHV- 1 infection is dependent on both {{the integrity of the}} microtubule network and the minus-end microtubule motor protein, dynein. In addition, we show that EHV- 1 actively induces the acetylation of tubulin, a marker of microtubule stabilization, as early as 15 min post-infection. Finally, our data support a role for the <b>cellular</b> kinase, <b>ROCK</b> 1, in virus trafficking to the nucleus...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCleft {{formation}} is the initial step in submandibular salivary gland (SMG) branching morphogenesis, and {{may result from}} localized actomyosin-mediated <b>cellular</b> contraction. Since <b>ROCK</b> regulates cytoskeletal contraction, we investigated the effects of ROCK inhibition on mouse SMG ex vivo organ cultures. Pharmacological inhibitors of ROCK, isoform-specific ROCK I but not ROCK II siRNAs, as well as inhibitors of myosin II activity stalled clefts at initiation. This finding implies {{the existence of a}} mechanochemical checkpoint regulating the transition of initiated clefts into progression-competent clefts. Downstream of the checkpoint, clefts are rendered competent through localized assembly of fibronectin promoted by ROCK I/myosin II. Cleft progression is primarily mediated by ROCK I/myosin II-stimulated cell proliferation with a contribution from cellular contraction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FN assembly itself promotes epithelial proliferation and cleft progression in a ROCK-dependent manner. ROCK also stimulates a proliferation-independent negative feedback loop to prevent further cleft initiations. These results reveal that cleft initiation and progression are two physically and biochemically distinct processes...|$|R
40|$|As an {{organism}} develops, it undergoes {{dramatic changes in}} shape as tissues and organs form. Changes in tissue morphology are driven at the cellular level by the coordinated movement, division, and shape change of constituent cells. These processes in turn are regulated by dynamic subcellular networks of actin and myosin. Rho Kinase (Rock) is a cytoskeletal regulator that phosphorylates non-muscle myosin II to drive remodeling of <b>cellular</b> architecture. <b>Rock</b> can be recruited to distinct subcellular locales via interaction with the Shroom (Shrm) family of proteins. Shrm proteins harbor several regulatory domains including an N-terminal PDZ that is used for localization, an SD 1 that binds F-actin, and a C-terminal SD 2 responsible for association with Rock. My thesis is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms employed by these domains to contribute to Shrm function. To this end, I crystallized and determined {{the structure of the}} complex between SD 2 and the Shrm binding domain (SBD) of Rock. This structure provides detailed insight into the interface between the two domains and motivated biochemical and in vivo probing to pinpoint residues that contribute to SD 2 -SBD recognition. Kinase activity assays indicate that Shrm proteins can stimulate Rock catalytic activity, demonstrating {{for the first time that}} Shrm proteins function directly as Rock activators. Additionally, I used structural and biochemical techniques to dissect the function of the Shrm 2 PDZ domain and determined its binding partner and binding mechanism. These data enhance our understanding of how the Shrm protein family contributes to development...|$|R
40|$|Membrane type 1 -matrix {{metalloproteinase}} (MT 1 -MMP, MMP 14), {{which is}} associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), promotes tumor formation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, in this report we demonstrate that MT 1 -MMP, by cleaving the underlying ECM, causes cellular aggregation of keratinocytes and SCC cells. Treatment with an MMP inhibitor abrogated MT 1 -MMP-induced phenotypic changes, but decreasing E-cadherin expression did not affect MT 1 -MMP-induced <b>cellular</b> aggregation. As <b>ROCK</b> 1 / 2 can regulate cell-cell and cell-ECM interaction, we examined its role in mediating MT 1 -MMP-induced phenotypic changes. Blocking ROCK 1 / 2 expression or activity abrogated the cellular aggregation resulting from MT 1 -MMP expression. Additionally, blocking Rho and non-muscle myosin attenuated MT 1 -MMP-induced phenotypic changes. Moreover, SCC cells expressing only the catalytically active MT 1 -MMP protein demonstrated increased cellular aggregation and increased myosin II activity in vivo when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Together, these results demonstrate that expression of MT 1 -MMP may be anti-tumorigenic in keratinocytes by promoting cellular aggregation...|$|R
40|$|The {{power of}} {{molecular}} oxygen to drive many crucial biogeochemical processes, from <b>cellular</b> respiration to <b>rock</b> weathering, makes reconstructing {{the history of}} its production and accumulation a first-order question for understanding Earthâ€™s evolution. Among the various geochemical proxies {{for the presence of}} O 2 in the environment, molecular fossils offer a unique record of O 2 where it was first produced and consumed by biology: in sunlit aquatic habitats. As steroid biosynthesis requires molecular oxygen, fossil steranes have been used to draw inferences about aerobiosis in the early Precambrian. However, better quantitative constraints on the O 2 requirement of this biochemistry would clarify the implications of these molecular fossils for environmental conditions {{at the time of their}} production. Here we demonstrate that steroid biosynthesis is a microaerobic process, enabled by dissolved O 2 concentrations in the nanomolar range. We present evidence that microaerobic marine environments (where steroid biosynthesis was possible) could have been widespread and persistent for long periods of time prior to the earliest geologic and isotopic evidence for atmospheric O 2. In the late Archean, molecular oxygen likely cycled as a biogenic trace gas, much as compounds such as dimethylsulfide do today. Agouron InstituteUnited States.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal and amoeboid {{movements}} are two important mechanisms adopted by cancer cells {{to invade the}} surrounding environment. Mesenchymal movement depends on extracellular matrix protease activity, amoeboid movement on the RhoA-dependent kinase ROCK. Cancer cells can switch from one mechanism to the other in response to different stimuli, limiting the efficacy of antimetastatic therapies. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the acquisition and molecular regulation of the invasion capacity of neoplastically transformed human fibroblasts, which were able to induce sarcomas and metastases when injected into immunocompromised mice. We found that neoplastic transformation {{was associated with a}} change in cell morphology (from fibroblastic to polygonal), a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, a decrease in the expression of several matrix metalloproteases and increases in cell motility and invasiveness. In a three-dimensional environment, sarcomagenic cells showed a spherical morphology with cortical actin rings, suggesting a switch from mesenchymal to amoeboid movement. Accordingly, cell invasion decreased after treatment with the ROCK inhibitor Y 27632, but not with the matrix protease inhibitor Ro 28 - 2653. The increased invasiveness of tumorigenic cells was associated with reduced expression of Rnd 3 (also known as RhoE), a <b>cellular</b> inhibitor of <b>ROCK.</b> Indeed, ectopic Rnd 3 expression reduced their invasive ability in vitro and their metastatic potential in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that, during neoplastic transformation, cells of mesenchymal origin can switch from a mesenchymal mode of movement to an amoeboid one. In addition, they point to Rnd 3 as a possible regulator of mesenchymal tumor cell invasion and to ROCK as a potential therapeutic target for sarcomas...|$|R
40|$|MiRNAs {{can have}} {{pleiotropic}} effects by targeting multiple genes belonging to diverse signalling networks. Alternatively, miRNAs {{can enhance the}} potency of their cellular effects by targeting multiple genes within the same genetic pathway. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that miR- 335 is a potent suppressor of tumour cell migration, invasion and metastasis, in part by targeting several genes involved in these <b>cellular</b> processes, including <b>ROCK</b> 1, MAPK 1, LRG 1, SP 1 and SOX 4. Here, we demonstrate that direct targeting of multiple members of the formin family of actin nucleators contributes to the inhibitory effects of miR- 335 in neuroblastoma cells. We demonstrate that miR- 335 regulates the expression of at least five formin family members and validate three family members, FMNL 3, FMN 2 and DAAM 2, as direct targets of miR- 335. The contribution of the formin family genes to cancer progression and metastasis has recently begun to emerge and here we demonstrate {{for the first time}} the ability of FMN 2 and DAAM 2 to regulate tumour cell migration and invasion, using siRNA-mediated inhibition of each of these formin genes. Finally, we demonstrate that the formin genes, in particular FMNL 3, are responsible for the protrusion of actin-rich filopodia structures that contribute to the enhanced migratory and invasive potential associated with reduced expression of miR- 335. Thus, direct targeting of the formin family contributes to the metastasis suppressing abilities of miR- 335 by providing a direct regulatory link to the actin assembly machinery of the cell. We conclude that miR- 335 is a master regulator of tumour cell migration and invasion by directly targeting a plethor...|$|R
40|$|The major <b>cellular</b> {{function}} of <b>ROCK</b> 1 is to regulate cell morphology, largely through {{the regulation of}} actinâ€“myosin and intermediate filaments. As a result, ROCK 1 directly influences several cellular activities, such as contraction, cytokinesis, adhesion, motility, endothelial barrier function, and membrane blebbing; it also indirectly influences processes such as gene transcription, proliferation, cell size, and survival. The wide range of processes influenced by ROCK 1 means that it is involved in many physiological functions (such as neuronal morphogenesis, smooth muscle contraction, immune cell chemotaxis, and epithelial sheet movements) and in pathophysiological conditions (such as tumor cell metastasis, hypertension, vasospasm, bronchial asthma, and glaucoma). ROCK 1 has a paralog in ROCK 2, which has 65 % identity overall with the highest degree of similarity in their kinase domains with 92 % identity. Although prokaryotes have two ROCK paralogs, eukaryotes such as Drosophila melanogaster (DRok) and Caenorhabditis elegans (LET- 502) have only a ROCK 2 homolog, suggesting {{that it is the}} ancestral form. Interestingly, genetic evidence from these organisms indicates that these ancestral versions are involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeletal structures, cell morphology and motility. Much of the research that has been undertaken to identify ROCK substrates has made use of ROCK 2; it has been generally assumed that the same proteins are also ROCK 1 substrates. It has been determined that ROCK 1, but not ROCK 2, is negatively regulated by Rnd 3 /RhoE and Gem, and to be caspase-cleaved and activated during apoptosis. Functionally, ROCK 1 might have a more significant function in regulating the actinâ€“myosin cytoskeleton and phagocytosis, possibly as a result of differences in phosphatidylinositol lipid binding and subcellular localization. Data from the ROCK 1 knockout mouse indicates that ROCK 1 regulation of actinâ€“myosin filaments is essential in closure of the eyelids and ventral body wall...|$|R
6000|$|At Monte Video, I noticed {{near the}} town, {{and along the}} base of the mount, beds of a living Mytilus, raised some feet above the surface of the Plata: in a similar bed, at a height from {{thirteen}} to sixteen feet, M. Isabelle collected eight species, which, according to M. d'Orbigny, now live {{at the mouth of the}} estuary. ("Voyage dans l'Amerique Merid.: Part. Geolog." [...] page 21.) At Colonia del Sacramiento, further westward, I observed at the height of about fifteen feet above the river, there of quite fresh water, a small bed of the same Mytilus, which lives in brackish water at Monte Video. Near the mouth of Uruguay, and for at least thirty-five miles northward, there are at intervals large sandy tracts, extending several miles from the banks of the river, but not raised much above its level, abounding with small bivalves, which occur in such numbers that at the Agraciado they are sifted and burnt for lime. Those which I examined near the A. S. Juan were much worn: they consisted of Mactra Isabellei, d'Orbigny, mingled with few of Venus sinuosa, Lam., both inhabiting, as I am informed by M. d'Orbigny, brackish water at the mouth of the Plata, nearly or quite as salt as the open sea. The loose sand, in which these shells are packed, is heaped into low, straight, long lines of dunes, like those left by the sea at the head of many bays. M. d'Orbigny has described an analogous phenomenon on a greater scale, near San Pedro on the river Parana, where he found widely extended beds and hillocks of sand, with vast numbers of the Azara labiata, at the height of nearly 100 feet (English) above the surface of that river. (Ibid page 43.) The Azara inhabits brackish water, and is not known to be found nearer to San Pedro than Buenos Ayres, distant above a hundred miles in a straight line. Nearer Buenos Ayres, on the road from that place to San Isidro, there are extensive beds, as I am informed by Sir Woodbine Parish, of the Azara labiata, lying at about forty feet above the level of the river, and distant between two and three miles from it. ("Buenos Ayres" [...] etc. by Sir Woodbine Parish page 168.) These shells are always found on the highest banks in the district: they are embedded in a stratified earthy mass, precisely like that of the great Pampean deposit hereafter to be described. In one collection of these shells, there were some valves of the Venus sinuosa, Lam., the same species found with the Mactra on the banks of the Uruguay. South of Buenos Ayres, near Ensenada, there are other beds of the Azara, some of which seem to have been embedded in yellowish, calcareous, semi-crystalline matter; and Sir W. Parish has given me from the banks of the Arroyo del Tristan, situated in this same neighbourhood, at the distance of about a league from the Plata, a specimen of a pale- reddish, calcereo-argillaceous stone (precisely like parts of the Pampean deposit the importance of which fact will be referred to in a succeeding chapter), abounding with shells of an Azara, much worn, but which in general form and appearance closely resemble, and are probably identical with, the A. labiata. Besides these shells, <b>cellular,</b> highly crystalline <b>rock,</b> formed of the casts of small bivalves, is found near Ensenada; and likewise beds of sea-shells, which from their appearance appear to have lain on the surface.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} ROCK 2 activation in squamous cell carcinogenesis and assess its co-operation with rasHa and fos oncogene activation together with loss of PTEN mediated AKT regulation. The analysis of ROCK deregulation with these genes in the MAP Kinase and PI 3 K pathways, two of the most commonly deregulated signalling systems, employed a well-characterised, transgenic mouse skin model of multi-stage carcinogenesis. A major goal was to study co-operation between these genes in the conversion of benign tumours to malignancy and investigate subsequent progression to aggressive carcinomas, given these are the most significant clinical stages of carcinogenesis from a patientâ€™s viewpoint; and also investigated effects of ROCK 2 deregulation on the processes of normal epidermal differentiation. ROCK 2 is an effector protein of RhoA, which is a member of the ras superfamily and ROCK 2 activation has been associated with tumour progression via an increase in tissue stiffness mediated by changes in actomyosin cytoskeleton leading to increased <b>cellular</b> motility. Thus, <b>ROCK</b> 2 expression is commonly associated with the later events in cancer. Furthermore, there are many studies investigating ROCK 2 in cancer given that it may be a useful therapeutic target in being downstream of oncogenic ras signalling. Yet, relatively few studies have explored the possibilities of a definite link that confirms the co-operation status of ROCK 2 activation with ras/MAPK/fos and /or PTEN/PI 3 K/AKT pathways in SCC aetiology. Thus, questions exist as to exactly when does ROCK 2 activation become causal; and what are the collaborating genes involved in the mechanism that drive the early or late stage events in carcinogenesis. To begin to answer these questions, inducible ROCK 2 activation has been introduced into a well-characterised transgenic mouse skin carcinogenesis model that expressed a combination of ras and fos activation, driven by a modified human keratin 1 vector (HK 1). Thus, exclusive epidermal expression of activated rasHa and fos oncogenes, in proliferative basal layers, gave hyperplasia and papillomatogenesis; but with no evidence of spontaneous malignant conversion. This stability of phenotype is thus ideal to assess roles for multiple transgene co-operations in the development of benign tumours and their conversion to malignancy. Hence, ROCK transgenic mice that expressed a conditionally active, 4 -hydroxytamoxifen (4 -HT) -regulated of human ROCK 2 transgene were crossed with mice expressing activated rasHa and /or fos exclusively in epidermal transit amplifying keratinocytes (HK 1. ras, HK 1. fos). Inducible PTEN tumour suppressor gene mutation via exon 5 ablation (K 14. Cre/D 5 PTENflx) and thus loss of AKT regulation was also incorporated into this model. This was achieved via deletion of exon 5 employing the RU 486 -mediated cre/loxP system, driven by keratin K 14 promoter expression in basal layer keratinocytes. Therefore, to facilitate this investigation, a new and unpublished inducible ROCK 2 system was employed in order to target the identical keratinocytes as PTEN loss. This new transgenic line of lsl. ROCKer transgenic mice employed the same 4 -HT inducible ROCKer transgene but now driven by a generic CAG promoter following cre mediated ablation of the stop cassette once treated with RU 486. In bi-genic K 14. ROCKer/HK 1. ras 1205 mice, synergism between ROCK 2 activation and (wound-promotion) sensitive HK 1. ras 1205 line showed direct co-operation and achieved malignant conversion of benign papillomas to well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (wdSCCs) histotypes (12 weeks of 4 -HT treatment). This placed ROCK 2 activity as the causal event driving malignant conversion, but in the absence of a wound promotion stimulus (loss of ear tag), papillomas did not convert. The correct papilloma context was required for ROCK to become causal proved to be the case on employing the wound insensitive HK 1. ras 1276 line. Here, K 14. ROCKer/HK 1. ras 1276 mice failed to exhibit any papillomas and required the constitutive promotion stimulus from additional fos activation. Interestingly, following cessation of 4 -HT, two intriguing observations were recorded. Firstly, that once bi-genic ROCK/ras 1205 achieved malignancy, exogenous ROCKer expression appeared to show no involvement once squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) progressed to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomas (pdSCCs), given the elevated expression of endogenous ROCK upon malignant progression. Secondly, the rapid growth of papilloma appeared upon cessation of 4 -HT with highly intense p 21 expression indicated the requirement of exogenous ROCK 2 for malignant conversion and the possibility of a papilloma inhibition by 4 -HT anti-cancer activity. Another major novel finding demonstrated ROCK 2 activation could act as an initiator in co-operation with fos activation. Direct co-operation between ROCK 2 and fos activation produced benign squamous papillomas yet, whereas ROCK 2 activation alone induced hyperplasia as did fos activation alone at this time point, given papilloma formation in HK 1. fos mice occur over 4 - 5 months. However, unlike deregulation of MAP Kinase signalling in bi-genic ROCK/ras 1205 mice, in bi-genic ROCK/fos mice, no malignant conversion was observed due to high levels of compensatory p 53 /p 21 expression. Thus, this bi-genic K 14. cre/lsl. ROCKer/HK 1. fos model suggests the requirement of additional mutation event for malignant conversion. An unexpected result appeared in bi-genic ROCK/Î” 5 PTENflx co-operation experiments where K 14. cre/lsl. ROCKer/Î” 5 PTENflx cohorts exhibited epidermal hyperplasia with folded papillomatous appearance to the epidermis, but without papillomatogenesis even after seven month of period. This either indicates a weak co-operation between ROCK 2 and Î” 5 PTENflx which may be due to the unexpected low levels of p-AKT from a compensatory increased p 21 expression; and additional events needed to fill in the oncogenic gap in this bi-genic ROCK/Î” 5 PTENflx model, or may possibly highlight redundancy in the oncogenic hits provided by ROCK and PTEN. This latter suggest similar links exist between their normal roles in the epidermis which may be accountable for the alterations observed in keratinocyte differentiation. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, K 14. cre/lsl. ROCKer/Î” 5 PTENflx cohorts showed alterations in epidermal differentiation via anomalous K 1 and low levels of K 6 expression. Interestingly, activated ROCK 2 appeared to induce or accelerate differentiation activity in K 14. cre/lsl. ROCKer keratinocytes via increased K 1 (early differentiation marker) and reduced K 6 (proliferation marker) expression profiles. These results were consistent with in vivo data where K 6 was expressed in low levels in K 14. cre/lsl. ROCKer hyperplasia histotypes. In contrast, in K 14. cre/lsl. ROCKer/Î” 5 PTENflx keratinocytes, inactivation of PTEN-mediated AKT activity may be accountable for restored keratin K 6 and anomalous keratin K 1 expression; as keratin K 1 was expressed in a similar fashion of normal keratinocytes in K 14. cre/lsl. ROCKer/fos keratinocytes. Interestingly, all tri-genic cohorts: K 14. cre/lsl. ROCKer/ras 1276 /fos, K 14. cre/lsl. ROCKer/fos/Î” 5 PTENflx and K 14. cre/lsl. ROCKer/ras 1276 /Î” 5 PTENflx synergisms exhibited malignant conversion and /or malignant progression in all animals highlighting a novel role of ROCK 2 activation. Further, the stage-specific consequences in each model in this study were shown to be influenced by p 53 /p 21 status, where typically p 53 expression disappeared in late stage papillomas yet, p 21 expression persisted. This demonstrated the importance of compensatory p 53 /p 21 expression in modulating tumour pathogenesis in all these models. Given that this study incorporated PTEN mutation, the influence of AKT activity was investigated in the SCC progression of tri-genic ROCK/ras 1276 /PTENflx and ROCK/fos/PTENflx cohorts; revealing a crucial antagonism between p 21 and AKT. However, this study revealed that the malignancy in tri-genic ROCK/ras 1276 /fos cohorts was not influenced by p-AKT expression, and as this tri-genic model achieved wdSCCs only. This suggests that as the roles of ROCK in altering cytoskeletal organisation leading to increase in tissue stiffness are overlaid onto both MAP Kinase and AKT deregulation, the outcome is a very aggressive pdSCC. Thus, suggesting ROCK signalling to be a potential therapeutic target for ras/MAPK/fos pathway in carcinogenesis. Overall, this study showed the involvement of ROCK 2 activation in the initiation stage for papillomatogenesis with fos oncogene, and demonstrated ROCK 2 as a converter again and also in malignant progression with ras/fos/Î” 5 PTENflx mutations. This indicates the link of ROCK 2 signalling with both MAPK and PI 3 K pathways, thus targeting ROCK 2 would aid in development of cancer therapy...|$|R
