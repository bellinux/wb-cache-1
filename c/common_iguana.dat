40|$|The {{complete}} mitochondrial genomes of two reptiles, the <b>common</b> <b>iguana</b> (Iguana iguana) and the caiman (Caiman crocodylus), were sequenced {{in order}} to investigate phylogenetic questions of tetrapod evolution. The addition of the two species allows analysis of reptilian relationships using data sets other than those including only fast-evolving species. The crocodilian mitochondrial genomes seem to have evolved generally {{at a higher rate}} than those of other vertebrates. Phylogenetic analyses of 2889 amino-acid sites from 35 mitochondrial genomes supported the bird-crocodile relationship, lending no support to the Haematotherma hypothesis (with birds and mammals representing sister groups). The analyses corroborated the view that turtles are {{at the base of the}} bird-crocodile branch. This position of the turtles makes Diapsida paraphyletic. The origin of the squamates was estimated at 294 million years (Myr) ago and that of the turtles at 278 Myr ago. Phylogenetic analysis of mammalian relationships using the additional outgroups corroborated the Marsupionta hypothesis, which joins the monotremes and the marsupials to the exclusion of the eutherians...|$|E

50|$|Adult iguanas {{found on}} most of St Lucia, mainly on the north east coast; Louvette and Grand Anse, have many {{differences}} compared to all other green iguana populations. They are light green with predominant black stripes. Instead of the typical orange dewlap, the iguanas of St. Lucia have a black dewlap. When compared to the <b>common</b> green <b>iguana,</b> females lay about half the amount of eggs, 25 instead of 50. Scales {{to the back of}} their head, near the jawbone, are smaller. Their iris is white or cream. Other green iguanas have yellow eyes.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> Green <b>Iguana,</b> (Iguana iguana), {{has been}} {{introduced}} from Honduras and is well-established on Grand Cayman as an invasive species. It far outnumbers the endemic blue iguana. No direct negative consequences of this introduction on the blue iguana are known, but {{the mere presence of}} the Green Iguana confuses public attitudes and understanding. For example, the people of the island are told that blue iguanas are endangered and rare, and when they subsequently see large numbers of the introduced Green Iguana, they do not understand the difference.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{the most}} <b>common</b> land <b>iguana</b> (Conolophus subcristatus) in the Galápagos Islands as an {{effective}} seed disperser is explored in this study. A total of 5705 seeds of 32 plant species were identified from 160 scats, 4545 of which (80 %) appeared visually undamaged. Germination trials of 849 seeds from 29 species revealed that at least 10 species remained viable after passing through the iguana's gut, although only {{a small proportion of}} those seeds (4 %) germinated. In any case, we argue that C. subcristatus exerts an important role on the 7 Galapagos islands where it occurs because of its abundance and capacity to ingest and disperse seeds at long distances. Our results strongly suggest that the Galápagos C. subcristatus plays an important role as a seed disperser of not only of native species but also some introduced plants in the Galápagos Islands.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{increase of}} hybridization in different groups {{is thought to}} have become more important with the loss of isolating barriers and the introduction of invasive species. This phenomenon could result in the extinction of endemic species. This study aims at investi-gating the hybridization dynamics between the endemic and threatened Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima) and the invasive <b>common</b> green <b>iguana</b> (Iguana iguana) in the Lesser Antilles, as well as assessing the impact of interspecific hybridization on the decline of I. delicatissima. 59 I. delicatissima (5 localities), 47 I. iguana (12 localities) and 27 hybrids (5 localities), who were all identified based on morphological characters, have been geno-typed at 15 microsatellites markers. We also sequenced hybrids using ND 4 mitochondrial loci to further investigate mitochondrial introgression. The genetic clustering of species and hybrid genetic assignment were performed using a comparative approach, through the im-plementation of a Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) based on statis-tics, as well as genetic clustering approaches based on the genetic models of several populations (Structure, NewHybrids and HIest), in order to get full characterization of hybrid...|$|R
50|$|Although Manuel Antonio National Park is Costa Rica's {{smallest}} national park, {{the diversity}} of wildlife in its 6.83 km2 is unequaled with 109 species of mammals and 184 species of birds. Both brown-throated three-toed sloth and Hoffmann's two-toed sloth are a major feature, as are three of Costa Rica's four monkey species — the mantled howler monkey, Central American squirrel monkey, and white-headed capuchin monkey. black spiny-tailed <b>iguana,</b> green <b>iguana,</b> <b>common</b> basilisk, white-nosed coati and many snake and bat species are also common in the park. Included in the 184 bird species are toucans, woodpeckers, potoos, motmots, tanagers, turkey vulture, parakeets and hawks. Dolphins can be observed there, {{as well as the}} occasional migrating whale. Scuba diving, snorkeling, sea kayaking, mountain biking, and hiking provide opportunities to experience the tropical wildlife that enriches Manuel Antonio.|$|R
40|$|This work {{documents}} the zootherapeutic practices in Ethnoveterinary medicine (EVM) of Pedra Lavrada (6 ° 45 'S, 36 ° 28 'W), Northeastern Brazil. We interviewed 23 people (22 men and 1 woman), who provided information on animal species used as remedies, body parts used {{to prepare the}} remedies, and illnesses for which the remedies were prescribed. We calculated the use-value to determine the most important species. Interviewees cited 11 animal taxa. The main species mentioned were ram - Ovis aries (UV= 0. 89), crab-eating fox - Cerdocyon thous (UV= 0. 79), <b>common</b> green <b>iguana</b> - Iguana iguana (UV= 0. 79), and South American rattlesnake - Caudisona durissa (Linnaeus, 1758) (UV= 0. 74). The most frequently cited treatments concerned to inflammatory and dermatological ailments or conditions, {{as well as to}} obstetric disorders. Similar to other studies, local ethnoveterinary establishes connections with human ethnomedicine. The results suggest that similarities in the repertoire of medicinal resources chosen by local residents reflect the local accessibility/availability of the resources. Our results help to preserve ethnoveterinary knowledge, which is important in enhancing our understanding on the relationship among humans, society and nature, and also to elaborate more effective strategies for conserving natural resources. Other studies for scientific validation of the effects and side effects of these zootherapeutic products are needed before they can be recommended or not for use...|$|R
40|$|Because of female-biased illegal harvesting, {{knowledge}} about the genetic mating system of the black spiny-tailed iguana Ctenosaura pectinata is of primary interest {{for the conservation of}} this threatened species. Based on the high levels of multiple paternity found in clutches of many other reptiles, particularly in lizards, it is hypothesised that multiple paternity may also be <b>common</b> in black <b>iguanas.</b> This was investigated by using microsatellite DNA to estimate the number of males siring nine litters (9 mothers, 121 offspring genotyped at ten polymorphic loci) of black iguanas. Contrary to expectations, only 11 % of sampled black iguana females produced litters consistent with being sired by multiple males. These data are the first evidence for the predominance of single paternity within an iguanid lizard, and suggest that black iguana may be more susceptible to loss of genetic variation in the face of gender-biased over-hunting pressure than previously thought...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic {{injuries}} {{of different}} extensity and intensity are <b>common</b> in green <b>iguanas</b> kept by private owners. The lesions are usually caused by inappropriate manipulation and poor terrarium construction and facilities, {{as well as}} by fights be-tween animals (Knotek et al., 1999). Due to the anatomy and behaviour, superficial skin injuries and fractures of limbs and tail are frequently seen (Hernandez-Divers, 2001). However, traumatic in-juries of internal organs are rather rare, and severe lung injuries are exceptional. Traumatic lung inju-ries and possible haemorrhage in reptiles are gen-erally caused by inappropriate fixation or by other animals (Schumacher, 2003; Wellehan and Gunkel, 2004). The diagnosis of trauma can be evident from physical examination, radiography or endoscopy (Rubel et al., 1991; Schumacher and Toal, 2001). Another cause of lung haemorrhage could be the calcification of soft tissues, urate depositions in lung tissue or lung vessels due to kidney failure. This paper describes lung haemorrhage in a green iguana (I. iguana) associated with fall from a height, and urate deposition in lung tissue and vessels...|$|R
50|$|The climate here is hot {{and humid}} due to its {{proximity}} to the ocean with a rainy season in the summer. Average temperatures vary between 30 and 38C. The south of the municipality is oceanfront and the north is formed by mountains of the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca. Various rivers pass through here {{on their way to}} the Pacific Ocean even more arroyos filling during the summer rainy season. Most of the rain falls in the mountains areas of the municipality rather than on the coast. Principal elevations include Vigia and Espino from which the main river flows. Despite the drainage of the principal lake, malaria is still a concern here. Vegetation is of the tropical and sub-tropical types and include a number of valuable tropical wood trees such as huanacastle, mahogany, cedar and Guaiacum coulteri, which are primarily used to make furniture. <b>Common</b> wildlife includes <b>iguanas,</b> deer, wild boar, armadillos, rabbits, raccoons and numerous birds native to the area. Coastal species include black coral, turtles sea bass, sharks and crabs, with bass, mojarra and shrimp found in the rivers.|$|R
40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{increase of}} hybridization in different groups {{is thought to}} have become more important with the loss of isolating barriers and the introduction of invasive species. This phenomenon could result in the extinction of endemic species. This study aims at investigating the hybridization dynamics between the endemic and threatened Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima) and the invasive <b>common</b> green <b>iguana</b> (Iguana iguana) in the Lesser Antilles, as well as assessing the impact of interspecific hybridization on the decline of I. delicatissima. 59 I. delicatissima (5 localities), 47 I. iguana (12 localities) and 27 hybrids (5 localities), who were all identified based on morphological characters, have been genotyped at 15 microsatellites markers. We also sequenced hybrids using ND 4 mitochondrial loci to further investigate mitochondrial introgression. The genetic clustering of species and hybrid genetic assignment were performed using a comparative approach, through the implementation of a Discriminant Analysis of Principal Component (DAPC) based on statistics, as well as genetic clustering approaches based on the genetic models of several populations (Structure, NewHybrids and HIest), in order to get full characterization of hybridization patterns and introgression dynamics across the islands. The iguanas identified as hybrids in the wild, thanks to morphological analysis, were all genetically F 1, F 2, or backcrosses. A high proportion of individuals were also the result of a longer-term admixture. The absence of reproductive barriers between species leads to hybridization when species are in contact. Yet morphological and behavioral differences between species could explain why males I. iguana may dominate I. delicatissima, thus resulting in short-term species displacement and extinction by hybridization and recurrent introgression from I. iguana toward I. delicatissima. As a consequence, I. delicatissima gets eliminated through introgression, as observed in recent population history over several islands. These results have profound implications for species management of the endangered I. delicatissima and practical conservation recommendations are being discussed in the light of these findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{atrioventricular}} junctional area (AVJA), including atrioventricular (AV) node and bundle {{was investigated}} in seven hearts of <b>common</b> or green <b>iguana</b> (Iguana iguana) using the light microscopy. Adult animals, both sexes, were captured in the Pantanal, Brazil. All hearts were fixed in buffered formaldehyde 10 % (pH 7. 2) for 24 hours, embedded in paraplast according to routine methods, and serially cut at 5 µm thickness. In the Iguana iguana, the AVJA consists of a mass of the fibers intermingled with variable amount of connective tissue and blood vessels surrounded by adjacent myocardium and the attachment of the right atrioventricular valve in the fibrous skeleton. By light microscopy, conducting cells of the AV node and bundle can be distinguished from working cells by their much smaller size, paler staining reaction {{and the presence of}} a sheath of connective tissue. The AV node and bundle and its branches were found to constitute a continuous tract. Histochemically, we found elastic fibers between cells of the conduction, mainly in the AV node. The PAS method reveals absence of glycogen in specialized cells. The fibrous skeleton, mainly the right trigone, showed a well-developed chondroid tissue, made by hyaline like cartilage (binucleated condrocytes included in the big lacunas and extracellular matrix with fibrillar collagen). In conclusion, the nodal and Purkinje cells in heart iguana presented poorly morphological differentiation comparing mammals and birds, however the skeleton fibrous has a different cartilage kind...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} snakes and lizards as pets {{has led to}} an increasing demand of specialised veterinary duties in these animals. Diagnostic imaging is often a fundamental step of the clinical investigation. The interpretation of diagnostic images is complex and requires a broad knowledge of anatomy, physiology and pathology of the species object of the clinical investigation. Moreover, in order to achieve a correct diagnosis, the comparison between normal and abnormal diagnostic images, for all the diagnostic imaging modalities, is mandatory. In this PhD thesis the diagnostic imaging features of some snake and lizard species are described. The aim of all the works presented is to provide some normal atlases matching the normal gross and cross-sectional anatomy with the normal radiographic, ultrasonographic, CT features {{of some of the most}} popular pet lizard and snake specie. In Chapter I a review of literature regarding snakes and lizards is presented. The aim of this chapter is to review the most commonly used diagnostic imaging modalities as well as to make an updated collection of the available international references describing the normal and pathological imaging features in snakes and lizards. Most of papers describing radiography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and other imaging modalities have been collected in order to overcome the lack of a unique reference regarding diagnostic imaging in snakes and lizards. The scientific aims and the outline of this thesis are presented in Chapter II. The general aim of this PhD thesis is to provide some useful anatomical and diagnostic imaging references in snakes and lizards. The first part of this work (Chapters III and IV) is focused on the description of the normal radiographic and computed tomographic features of the head of some snakes and lizards species. The second part (Chapters V to VII) is focused on the diagnostic imaging of the coelomic cavity; the description of the normal contrast enhanced computed tomographic features of the coelomic cavity of some lizards, the normal ultrasonographic features of the coelomic cavity of some snake species and the normal upper gastro-intestinal examination in the ball python are presented. In Chapter III the normal stratigraphic and cross sectional anatomy is matched with the normal radiographic and computed tomographic features of the head of the Boa constrictor. 4 boa constrictor’s cadavers head where used in this study. Radiographs of the head were taken in LL and DV projections using a high detail screen-film combination. CT scans scans of the head where performed in a CC and a LL direction with a slice thickness of 1, 5 mm and displayed in a bone window. 2 heads where dissected following a stratigraphic approach and 2 heads frozen for 24 h (- 20 °C) and then sectioned into 3 mm slices respecting the imaging protocol. All anatomical structures have been identified and labelled with the aid of available literature in the anatomical images and then matched on the corresponding radiographic and computed tomographic images. Radiographic and CT images provided a high detail for the visualisation of bony structures; soft tissues were not easily identified on radiographic and CT images. In Chapter IV the normal radiographic and contrast enhanced computed tomographic features of the head of the green <b>iguana,</b> <b>common</b> tegu and bearded dragon are described. The study included 4 cadavers for each considered species and 6 adult green iguanas, 4 tegus, 3 bearded dragons. Prior to the beginning of the radiographic and computed tomographic studies 2 cadavers were dissected following a stratigraphic approach and 2 cadavers were cross-sectioned for each species. Anatomical studies were performed following the same approach described in Chapter III. Both the radiographic and the computed tomographic studies were performed only in live animals. Radiographic studies included a LL and a DV projection. Pre- and post- contrast computed tomographic studies of the head were performed in a CC direction. CT images were displayed in both bone and soft tissue windows. Individual anatomical structures were first recognised and labelled on the anatomic images and then matched on radiographs and CT images. Radiographic studies provided a good detail both of the soft tissues (especially in the green iguana) and of the bony structures. CT images provided an excellent detail of the bony structures in all the considered species. The soft tissues were clearly outlined only in the green <b>iguana.</b> In the <b>common</b> tegu and the bearded dragon only the eyes were clearly outlined from the remaining soft tissues. In Chapter V the normal contrast enhanced computed tomographic features of the coelomic cavity of the green iguana, black and white tegu and the bearded dragon are described. 4 cadavers and 4 live animals for each considered species were object of this study. The cadavers were frozen for 24 hours and then cross sectioned at 5 mm intervals. The slices have been cleaned with water and photographed on both sides. In order to reduce the duration of the procedure only contrast enhanced CT scans have been performed. The CT scans have been performed in a CC direction. The CT scans have been displayed in a soft tissue and, when appropriate, in a lung window. Individual organs have been recognised and labelled on the anatomical images and then matched on the corresponding CT images. Most of the coelomic organs have been identified in all the considered species. Results provide an atlas of the normal cross sectional and CT features of the coelomic cavity of lizards. In Chapter VI the normal ultrasonographic features of the coelomic cavity of the Boa constrictor, Python molurus, Python curtus and Python regius are described. Moreover, normal reference ultrasonographic measurements of the scent glans, the colonic, gastric and pyloric wall thickness are reported. 46 live snakes (16 Python regius, 10 Python molurus, 12 Python curtus and 8 Boa constrictor) and 23 cadavers (6 Python regius, 4 Python molurus, 10 Python curtus, 3 Boa constrictor) where object of this study. Anatomical studies where performed prior to the beginning of the ultrasonographic studies in order to characterise the normal anatomical features of the above mentioned species. In previous ultrasonographic studies of the coelomic cavity of the Boa constrictor studies a ventral approach on sedated animals was proposed. We have decided to use a lateral approach on unsedated animals. Although, especially in larger animals, the shadowing effect produced by the ribs was evident in some images, most of the coelomic organs (scent glands, hemipenes, cloaca, ureters, colon, small intestine, pylorus, stomach, pancreas, liver, gallbladder and oesophagus) have been recognised. The rate of ultrasonographic recognition of individual organs is reported. Results provide a description of the normal ultrasonographic features of coelomic cavity of boid snakes along with a series of tables matching the gross and cross sectional anatomy with corresponding normal ultrasonographic images. In Chapter VII the technique and the normal features of upper gastro-intestinal examination in ball pythons are described. 10 ball python's cadavers have been dissected and cross sectioned prior to the the beginning of the study in order to characterise the normal features of the intestine in this species. 18 healthy ball pythons where object of this study. All animals where not fed for at least 7 days before the beginning of the study. The animals have been divided into three groups (A, B, C). Contrast medium (barium sulphate) at the dose of 25 ml/kg has been administered through an esophageal probe at an increasing concentration (25...|$|R
