5|$|On Halloween, when Homer {{collects}} {{supplies to}} protect his family and home from the marauding zombies, he decides to pursue a black sports car—which is a probe for the aliens' ship—to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. There, he finds Professor Frink, who has discovered the aliens' weakness: nuclear waste. He {{plans to use the}} alien ship's tractor beam to suck up <b>cars</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> loaded with barrels of nuclear waste. After successfully loading Frink's car, along with three more, into the aliens' tractor beam, the ship explodes. The following day, Springfield is returned to normal, and Homer is seen as a celebrity among the alien viewers of Foolish Earthlings.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, two less {{powerful}} T single-car units were built, {{designed to be}} prototypes used on the Oslo Tramway. After a one-year trial, they were put into scheduled traffic to the Kolsås Line, where they remained in regular service until 1983. The production series is somewhat different in design and performance. T1000 is both {{used to refer to}} the class as a whole, or the first 162 <b>cars,</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which have been given the designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with pantographs which previously allowed them operate on {{the western part of the}} network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer units were designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt units were designated T7 and T8.|$|E
5|$|In general appearance, {{the current}} {{operating}} line of SIR looks somewhat like an outdoor {{line of the}} New York City Subway. Since the 1960s, it has been grade separated from all roads, but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville, {{the end of the}} line. It uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third rail power. Its equipment are R44 subway type <b>cars</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> specially modified with headlight dimmers, electric windshield defrosters, FRA Compliant cab signals and horns, and FRA regulation 223 required shatterproof glazing, and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors. The cars were built in early 1973, {{at the tail end of}} the R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit (the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company). Heavy maintenance of the equipment is performed at NYCT's Clifton Shops. Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the subway's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn. The right-of-way also includes elevated, embankment and open-cut portions, and a tunnel near St. George.|$|E

25|$|In December 2014, Supercars {{released}} details {{concerning the}} future of the category. New regulations, dubbed Gen2 Supercar, were introduced in 2017 to allow the use of two-door coupé body styles and turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines. However, no teams elected to build cars for the new regulations until 2018. Cars are still required to be based on front-engined, rear-wheel drive, four-seater production <b>cars</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> sold in Australia. The chassis and control components will be carried over from the New Generation V8 Supercar regulations, while engine and aerodynamic parity will be reviewed.|$|E

25|$|A {{cable car}} is superficially {{similar to a}} funicular, but differs from such a system in that its cars are not {{permanently}} attached to the cable and can stop independently, whereas a funicular has <b>cars</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> permanently attached to the propulsion cable, which is itself stopped and started. A cable car cannot climb as steep a grade as a funicular, but many more cars can be operated with a single cable, making it more flexible, and allowing a higher capacity. During the rush hour on San Francisco's Market Street Railway, a car would leave the terminal every 15 seconds.|$|E

In 2008, the series came together in east and west divisions under sponsorship from Camping World as the Camping World Series. K Filters took over the sponsorship in 2010.|$|E

Toyota’s global chief engineer Tetsuya Tada saw a quarter scale clay {{model of the}} car {{during a trip to}} the Australian branch in 2014 and arranged for a full scale, fully function version to be built in Japan by Toyota's Takumi ("artisan") craftsmen. Tada said, “while we never say never, and I would love this concept to become a production reality, it is very much a concept that demonstrates the passion within Toyota for <b>cars</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> fun to drive". Commenting on the new car, Toyota's Australian Divisional Manager National Marketing Brad Cramb said: ”The Toyota 86 lends itself perfectly to a concept that expands its appeal with added versatility while retaining its sleek and sporty coupe styling and sharp, responsive driving character”.|$|E

500|$|In February 2013, the Association of Global Automakers and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which {{submitted}} a joint comment to the NHTSA, announced their {{support to the}} rule, but asked the NHTSA to find a noise level that effectively alerts pedestrians without being excessively loud to others {{inside and outside of}} the vehicle. They also commented that the rule is too complicated, unnecessarily prescriptive, and it will cost more than necessary. Some automakers also said {{there is no need for}} electric-drive vehicles to play sounds while not in motion, [...] "since it is not clear that it helps pedestrians to hear <b>cars</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> stopped in traffic or parked." [...] In addition, the carmakers requested the NHTSA to make the new sound system required by 2018 instead of 2014.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} how they worked {{hard to make the}} {{animation}} believable, saying: [...] "It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s <b>cars</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator {{to be able to put}} some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way." ...|$|E
