60|$|When we {{left the}} dining-room, she {{proposed}} to show me {{over the rest of}} the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome. The large front chambers I thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity. The furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose <b>cushioned</b> <b>tops</b> were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust. All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory. I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of moonlight.|$|R

The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, {{which had to be}} conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire.

60|$|Such {{were the}} {{thoughts}} which {{ran through the}} king's head as he bent over the rich crimson <b>cushion</b> which <b>topped</b> his prie-dieu of carved oak. He knelt in his own enclosure {{to the right of}} the altar, with his guards and his immediate household around him, while the court, ladies and cavaliers, filled the chapel. Piety was a fashion now, like dark overcoats and lace cravats, and no courtier was so worldly-minded as not to have had a touch of grace since the king had taken to religion. Yet they looked very bored, these soldiers and seigneurs, yawning and blinking over the missals, while some who seemed more intent upon their devotions were really dipping into the latest romance of Scudery or Calpernedi, cunningly bound up in a sombre cover. The ladies, indeed, were more devout, and were determined that all should see it, for each had lit a tiny taper, which she held in front of her on the plea of lighting up her missal, but really that her face might be visible to the king, and inform him that hers was a kindred spirit. A few there may have been, here and there, whose prayers rose from their hearts, and who were there of their own free will; but the policy of Louis had changed his noblemen into courtiers and his men of the world into hypocrites, until the whole court was like one gigantic mirror which reflected his own likeness a hundredfold.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{broad range}} of {{possible}} target behaviors: self-care, attending activities, academic behavior, disruptive behavior. A token economy is more than just using exchangeable tokens. For a token economy to work, criteria have to be specified and clear. A staff member giving tokens to a client just because he judges he is behaving positively, is not part of a token economy because it is not done in a systematic way. Sometimes client manuals have specifications how many tokens can be earned by each target behavior. For instance, if making the bed is a target behavior, staff and clients have to know how a well-made bed looks like: do the sheets have to be put under the mattress, <b>cushion</b> on <b>top?</b> However, often these specifications are hard to make: behavior such as eating politely and positive cooperation are hard to specify. While planning how many tokens can be earned by each target behavior some factors have to be considered: on the one hand clients should be able to earn a minimal amount of tokens for a minimal effort, {{and on the other hand}} clients should not earn too much too soon, making more effort useless.Sometimes the possibility of punishment by token loss is included, technically called 'response cost': disruptive behavior can be fined with the loss of tokens.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the CUR {{committee}} 159 B {{has been working on}} the new Dutch Design Guideline for the design of piled embankments. To validate the guideline several field tests have been performed. From the field measurements is concluded that the design method is very conservative. Improving the design guideline will reduce the construction costs. To understand the physical behaviour of the piled embankment and to validate the theory, experimental scale tests have been performed. During these tests the load distribution, deformation and strains were measured. The results of the scale tests are analysed and published. To improve the understanding of the phenomenon arching and where possible, to confirm the observed load distributions and displacements, numerical analysis of the scale tests have been performed and reported in this thesis. The numerical analysis of the scale test is performed with Plaxis 3 D Tunnel version 2. 4 (Plaxis). The geometry of the Plaxis model is one quarter of the geometry of the scale test. This reduces the amount of elements and therefore the calculation time. In the scale test circular piles are applied. Circular geometry cannot be modelled in Plaxis, therefore the circular pile is mathematically converted to a square pile. The sand and granular material are modelled with Mohr Coulomb (MC) model and Hardening Soil (HS) model. The scale test is driven by applying top load and by drainage of the foam <b>cushion.</b> The <b>top</b> load is modelled as the measured equally distributed load on the embankment. To model the drainage of the foam cushion, the measured water pressure is assigned to the subsoil clusters in Plaxis by a water pressure head. From the Plaxis results can be concluded that arching is immediately found after the first drainage of the foam <b>cushion.</b> Increasing the <b>top</b> load and drainage of the foam cushion in Plaxis results in an increase of loads transferred to the pile by arching and GR, thus results in improvement of arching. The by Plaxis calculated tensile forces in the GR are concentrated in ‘tensile strips’ that lie on top and between adjacent piles. The largest displacement of the GR is found at the middle of four piles. The results of the Plaxis calculations are compared to the scale test results. The total load on the pile and water pressure in the foam cushion found with Plaxis are corresponding with the scale test results. During {{the first part of the}} test, the load distribution shows similar results as the measured load distribution. During the second part of the test the load transferred to the pile by arching is overestimated and the load transferred to the pile by the GR is underestimated. The displacement of the geosynthetic reinforcement calculated with Plaxis is underestimated compared to the scale test results. In general the results of the HS model are better than the MC model. By varying a number of parameters in the model, possible causes for the underestimated displacement are investigated. This research concludes that the stiffness of the foam cushion and the water pressure in the foam cushion does not have influence on the GR displacement. The vertical effective stresses are concentrated on and directly next to the pile and are relatively small between the piles. The internal friction angle does have a large influence on the geosynthetic reinforcement displacement, because when the internal friction angle is decreased, the arch decreases and the settlements increase. However, the measured geosynthetic reinforcement displacement from the scale test is still not found in the numerical results calculated in Plaxis.

40|$|A {{decelerator}} {{was needed}} for the Armstrong Hall Microgravity tower. Three designs were considered as concepts and the one chosen was an airbag. The airbag is 5 feet tall and 4. 5 feet in diameter due to floor constraints. The deceleration was controlled by designing the vent system to provide the needed vent area {{as a function of}} time. This dynamics vent area controls the rate at which volume is expelled from the airbag. The volume expelled depends on the pressure inside the airbag, thus, a direct relation between the vent area and the deceleration profile was determined. ^ The airbag and associated infrastructure was designed, manufactured, and tested. This system includes an airbag with a <b>cushion</b> on <b>top</b> to prevent wear, cart and rails, a drop package, and a latch and release system. More than forty tests were done with different drop height and drop weight combinations culminating in three drops of 200 lbs from the third floor. The drop weight was varied by adjusting the water level in a plastic barrel in the drop package. ^ Pressure measurements inside the bag and vent were taken using two pressure transducers. The pressure transducers sampled the pressure at one of the exit vents and {{at the center of the}} bottom of the airbag. The signals were low-pass filtered for noise and scaled for pressure. ^ The pressure traces were processed to find the mean deceleration. The deceleration was found to be independent of drop weight, only depending on drop height. The traces were also integrated to find a momentum per unit area. This value was then compared to the momentum of the drop package. From these two results an effective impact area can be found. It was found that the cushion not only reduced wear but also increased the effective impact area substantially. This increase in area reduced the value of the mean deceleration by reducing the pressure inside the airbag. ^ The airbag proved to work well for the drops, decelerating the package and preventing a direct hit with the bottom of the container and cart. ...|$|R
50|$|At 1,000 mph, a 30-inch {{diameter}} wheel will {{be turning}} over 10,000 rpm, generating a centrifugal force of 50,000g at the rim. When {{it was found}} that even with a hollow all carbon fiber wheel, based on a rim sandwiched between two disks, the lightest that could be expected for a 30-inch diameter 8 inch wide wheel was still 230 lbs, {{the decision was made to}} explore reducing rotating mass by going to a design where only the outer rim rotates. This had the ripple effect of making an internal suspension system practical, which in turn freed up the volume that would otherwise be occupied by a conventional suspension system. To generate a stable and consistent steering response, tireless wheels must plane on the surface of the track instead of plowing ruts. The wheel width of 8 inches for RV-1 was determined by reviewing the experience of other teams to run vehicles with tireless wheels on a salt flat. Based on the experiences of these other teams, it was felt 8 inches should be wide enough to support a five tons gross weight vehicle running on dry salt without cutting ruts. The wheel rim will rotate on air bearings placed around the perimeter of a bearing block that also houses the slide which serves as the suspension system.

APOEL produced one of their best performances since Thorsten Fink took over in January 2015, and got the three points thanks to a fortuitous John Arne Riise cross that was deflected over the visitors keeper Thomas Kaminski, just after the half hour mark. On 14 March 2015, APOEL were held to a 1-1 draw by Omonia and Apollon took advantage of APOEL's draw to move one point clear at the top of the table after beating AEK Larnaca. Omonia took the lead in the sixth minute when André Schembri managed to squeeze the ball past the unsighted APOEL keeper Dionisis Chiotis and Rafik Djebbour headed the equalizer for APOEL in the 37th minute after receiving a Constantinos Charalambides' cross from the right. In the top-of-the-table clash on 21 March 2015, APOEL and Apollon shared the spoils with a 2-2 draw at GSP Stadium, with all four goals being scored in the first half. Despite a host of players missing, APOEL had twice taken the lead, first through Tiago Gomes and then through new signing Valmir Nafiu but they were twice pegged back through Gastón Sangoy’s penalty and then through Fotis Papoulis who took advantage of a slip at APOEL's defense. On 4 April 2015, APOEL suffered their first defeat under German coach Thorsten Fink after going down 1-0 to AEK Larnaca at GSZ Stadium and remained one point behind Apollon, who also lost 3-1 at home to Anorthosis. The only goal of the game came six minutes before half-time after a string of errors in APOEL’s backline allowed forward Nestoras Mitidis to beat Dionisis Chiotis from just inside the penalty box, while APOEL went down to 10 men in the 58th minute after Carlão received a second yellow card. On 19 April 2015, APOEL returned {{to the top of the}} table following their easy 3-0 home win against Ermis Aradippou and Apollon’s 1-0 defeat by Omonia. An early strike from Martin Lanig followed by a goal in each half from Rafik Djebbour, sent APOEL two points clear at the top of the table with five games left to go in the end-of-season playoffs. On 25 April 2015, APOEL came from behind three times to earn a thrilling 3-3 draw against Anorthosis at Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium and remained top of the table as all other championship play-off matches ended also in draw. Former APOEL striker Esmaël Gonçalves gave the Anorthosis the lead twice in the first half, with Constantinos Charalambides and Georgios Efrem answering for APOEL in the first half and early in the second half respectively. Andreas Makris restored the lead for Anorthosis in the second half, before a late Jason Demetriou own goal restored parity. APOEL, who hit the post three times, could have clinched it deep into injury time but their top scorer Rafik Djebbour blasted over from close range with the goal gaping. On 2 May 2015, APOEL defeated arch rivals Omonia 3-2 at GSP Stadium and widened its lead at the top of the table to five points after Apollon went down 0-2 to AEK Larnaca. APOEL had taken a first-half lead against ten-men Omonia, who saw Ucha Lobjanidze receive a double-booking in quick succession for a foul and then dissent, through Tomás De Vincenti's penalty in the 37th minute. Omonia made a comeback in the 54th minute and equalised with Nuno Assis, who kept up his scoring form soon after netted his second goal to give his team the lead in the 56th minute. Nektarios Alexandrou leveled proceedings three minutes later, before Rafik Djebbour bundled home John Arne Riise’s header in the fourth minute of stoppage time, helping APOEL to take a giant leap towards sealing the 24th league title in their history. On 10 May 2015, APOEL lost 1-0 to Apollon Limassol in a scrappy top of the table clash at Tsirion Stadium thanks to a Fotis Papoulis winner in the 67th minute. The win brought Apollon with two points of leaders APOEL, just two matches before the end of the season. On 11 May 2015, one day after the team's loss to Apollon and following a run of disappointing performances, Thorsten Fink was sacked by APOEL, although at that moment the team were at the top of the league, with only two matches remaining. The same day, APOEL's technical director Gustavo Manduca, who only hung up his boots last month, took over as caretaker manager for the team’s crucial final two league games of the season, as well as the Cypriot Cup final, alongside assistant coach Giorgos Kostis and former skipper Marinos Satsias. On 16 May 2015, APOEL missed out on the chance to celebrate their 24th league title after battling to a 1-1 draw with AEK Larnaca, but the gap over second-placed Apollon (who lost to Anorthosis) was increased to three points, meaning that now APOEL was needing only a draw in their final game at Ermis Aradippou to lift the trophy. Gustavo Manduca made his debut in the dugout for APOEL since taking over as caretaker manager after the dismissal of Thorsten Fink and got his first taste of pressure on the bench when Serbian midfielder Vladimir Boljević scored from the penalty spot to give AEK Larnaca the lead after just 12 minutes. Tomás De Vincenti levelled the score in the 24th minute after converting a penalty won by Brazilian defender Kaká, while APOEL missed a great chance to win the league title when Cillian Sheridan's 77th minute shot came off the post and Efstathios Aloneftis couldn’t strike home the rebound. On 24 May 2015, APOEL secured their third consecutive championship title and their second double in a row after beating Ermis Aradippou 4-2 at Ammochostos Stadium on the last day of the season. APOEL got off to a perfect start when Tomás De Vincenti opened the score with a low drive in the 9th minute and Constantinos Charalambides doubled the score soon after. Giannis Taralidis pulled one back for Ermis after 15 minutes, but APOEL restored their two-goal <b>cushion</b> through their <b>top</b> scorer Rafik Djebbour who scored from the penalty spot five minutes later. In the 39th minute, Rafik Djebbour scored his second of the day after good work by Nuno Morais to give APOEL a three goals half-time lead. Former APOEL forward Andreas Papathanasiou made it 4-2 immediately after half-time, but there was no spoiling the party which was already underway in the stands as APOEL were crowned champions for the 24th time in their history.|$|R
