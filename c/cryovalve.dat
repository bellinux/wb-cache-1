40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the technology of infrared detectors have made possible {{a wide range of}} scientific measurements and investigations. One of the requirements for the use of sensitive IR detectors is that the entire instrument be cooled to temperatures approaching absolute zero. The cryogenic cooling system for these instruments is commonly designed as a large dewar containing liquid helium which completely surrounds the apparatus. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a remotely controlled, motorized <b>cryovalve</b> that is simple, reliable, and compact and can operate over extended periods of time in cryo-vac conditions. The design, development, and test of a motorized <b>cryovalve</b> with application to a variety of cryogenic systems currently under development is described...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the immediate and short-term outcome of inserted cryopreserved vein valve allografts and the clinical outcome of treated limbs. Method: Twenty-seven cryovalves were inserted in 25 postthrombotic limbs because of active leg ulcer (20 limbs) or severe disabling leg pain (five limbs) as a procedure of last resort. Previous venous surgery had been performed in 80 % of the limbs. Main stem superficial reflux and iliac venous outflow obstruction were controlled before <b>cryovalve</b> insertion. The most common insertion site was the superficial femoral or popliteal vein. Patients were followed up with clinical examination and with intermittent duplex Doppler scanning or ascending venography to assess patency and competency of the valve station. Results: After thawing, but before insertion, 74 % of the cryovalves were incompetent and needed repair with transcommissural valvuloplasty. After insertion, mortality was zero. Morbidity was 48 %, mainly because of seroma formation and deep wound infection. One <b>cryovalve</b> was explanted because of acute rejection. Six cryovalves occluded early (< 6 weeks), and five occluded late. Cumulative rates of patent cryovalves and both patent and competent cryovalves at 24 -month follow-up were 41 % and 27 %, respectively. Cumulative ulcer recurrence-free rate at 36 months was 50 %. Pain relief was poor, and degree of swelling remained the same. Conclusion: Compared with autologous vein transfer, <b>cryovalve</b> insertion is associated with high morbidity, high occlusion rate, poor cumulative midterm rate of patent graft with competent valve, and poor clinical results. The procedure should not be used as a primary technique for valve reconstruction, and it is questionable whether it is useful even in patients in whom autologous reconstruction techniques have been exhausted. The basis of the high failure rate is unclear; it may be immunologic or due to loss of endothelial cover after implantation. If cryovalves are to be a viable valve repair alternative, improved cryopreservation technique, immunologic modifications, or better matching must be achieved.

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{compared}} {{clinical outcomes}} of patients receiving <b>CryoValve</b> SG decellularized pulmonary valves {{with those of}} patients receiving conventionally processed <b>CryoValve</b> pulmonary valves. MethodsAll consecutive patients undergoing Ross procedures and right ventricular outflow tract reconstructions with SG valves at 7 institutions (February 2000 –November 2005) were assessed retrospectively (193 Ross procedures, 149 right ventricular outflow tract reconstructions). Patient, procedural, and outcome data were compared with those from 1246 conventional implants (665 Ross procedures, 581 right ventricular outflow tract reconstructions). Hemodynamic function was assessed at latest follow-up. ResultsFollow-up was complete for 99 % in SG group and 94 % in conventional group, with mean follow-ups of 4. 0 years (range, 0 – 6. 7 years) for SG and 3. 7 years (range, 0 – 6. 7 years) for conventional. Five-year cumulative survivals and freedoms from adverse events were comparable between SG and conventional valves. Among patients undergoing Ross procedures, peak gradient at last follow-up was lower with SG valves (P <. 01); no difference was observed in the right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction population. Pulmonary insufficiency was significantly reduced with SG valves in patients undergoing both Ross procedures (P <. 01) and right ventricular outflow tract reconstructions (P <. 01). Valve type {{was not a significant}} predictor of valve-related failure in propensity-adjusted analysis of either procedure. ConclusionsCryoValve SG decellularized pulmonary valves have acceptable clinical outcomes and favorably compare with conventionally processed valves. Improved hemodynamic function observed with SG valves could signify improved long-term outcomes and {{may be due to the}} decreased antigenicity of these valves...|$|E
40|$|Efficiency of {{post-operative}} sutured tissues {{depends on}} the state stress and strain, affecting the rate of wound healing. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine, the effect of suture size and stiffness, on the deformation of an incised continuous tissue. A simple running suture configuration was modeled and analyzed using 3 D Finite Element Method (FEM). Prolene suture thread (Ethicon Inc.) of size 7 - 0 and 8 - 0 with varying material stiffness in the range of 6240 MPa to 30 MPa have been used whereas <b>CryoValve</b> aorta graft (Cryo Life Inc.) is considered as tissue material. Results show that the suture size has major impact on the deformation state of the tissue than the suture stiffness. Even though the difference in material stiffness caused a negligibl...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundRecognition of the {{immunogenicity}} {{of standard}} cryopreserved allografts {{has led to}} the development of new decellularized allografts (<b>CryoValve</b> SG; CryoLife, Inc, Kennesaw, Ga). This preliminary study examined the HLA antibody response to these decellularized allografts and compared it with the response to standard allograft material. MethodsWe prospectively measured the frequency of panel-reactive HLA class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C) and class II (HLA-DR/DQ) alloantibodies in 14 children (age 8. 5 ± 7. 9 years) receiving decellularized, cryopreserved allografts, including 6 undergoing allograft patch insertion and 8 with a valved pulmonary allograft. We compared them with 20 historical control subjects (age 1. 7 ± 2. 4 years) undergoing implantation of standard cryopreserved allografts, 8 with valves and 12 with allograft patch. All patients had panel-reactive antibody levels measured before and at 1, 3, and 12 months after the operation. HLA class I and class II panel-reactive antibody levels were determined with a sensitive flow cytometry technique. ResultsWe found panel-reactive antibody levels in decellularized allografts to be elevated slightly from preoperative levels for both class I and class II antibodies at 1, 3, and 12 months (P >. 05). The panel-reactive antibody level for both class I and class II antibodies were significantly lower for decellularized allografts as compared to standard allografts. Functionally, the allografts were similar with decellularized valved grafts showing a peak echo-determined systolic gradient of 13 ± 15 mm Hg at 8 ± 2. 6 months postoperatively as compared to a gradient of 24 ± 18 mm Hg measured 12 ± 6 months postoperatively in standard allografts (P =. 11). ConclusionsDecellularized grafts elicited significantly lower levels of class I and class II HLA antibody formation at 1, 3, and 12 months after implantation than did standard cryopreserved allografts. Early hemodynamic function of decellularized grafts was similar to that of standard cryopreserved allograft valves. Further experience is necessary to determine whether the reduced immunogenicity of decellularized allografts will truly allow tissue ingrowth and improved long-term durability in patients...|$|E
