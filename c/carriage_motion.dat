The dynamic system consists of a scanning carriage, power transmission elements, a prime mover, and a control subsystem. The prime mover is a permanent magnet DC motor that is positioned by a direct digital control system. The scan <b>carriage</b> <b>motion</b> is mathematically modeled and simulated using ACSL and DADS simulation software. T he simulation results are compared to empirical data.

40|$|Introduction: In {{this paper}} the braking issues of {{passenger}} trains {{which have a}} great speed and frequent stops are examines. Problem statement: These processes are ехpensive and have big energy losses. The proposed solution to the problem: The kinetic energy of braking prosses propose to turn into thermal energy of heating fluid. For this purpose special hydraulic brake is proposed. The brake is connected with the wheel carriage pairs. The process {{is based on the}} energy dissipation in liqid when the disks with spikes rotate in it. Because the real liquid has friction and viscosity, it will be heat up, when the mechanical parts of the hydraulic brake are moved in it. The design, operating principle and characteristics of the hydraulic brake are proposed. Transmission of kinetic energy of <b>carriage</b> <b>motion</b> to brake system executed by mechanical clutches. It connected with the wheel pair and transmitting the energy the wheels rotation to hydraulic brake discs. The cylindrical rods are installed on the discs. Rods location fits the profile of the curved centrifugal pump vanes. As result, the fluid heatind prosess by rotatinge discs with rods take place also at the same time with the liquid pumping through the inner volume of brake system. Conclusions: Affordable passenger carriage braking dynamic is achieved by varying the size and number of rods. The heated liquid may be subsequently used for household needs and for heating the passenger carriage...|$|E
40|$|This paper compares {{previously}} unpublished laboratory {{measurements of}} the vortex-induced vibrations of a vertical tension riser with predictions of five CFD-based riser codes. The experiments were carried out with a 13 m long, 28 mm diameter model riser of which the upper 7 m was in air, and the remainder in water with a uniform flow generated by <b>carriage</b> <b>motion</b> at speeds up to 1 m/s. In-line and cross-flow responses were computed from {{measurements of the}} curvature of the riser at 32 stations over its length. Key results are compared with blind CFD predictions in which the flow is computed in two dimensions on each {{of a number of}} horizontal planes. The CFD codes used in this exercise represent a wide range of approaches, represented by (1) a vorticity-stream function method using a finite volume technique for integrating the vorticity transport equation, (2) finite elements with linear interpolation functions on a triangular grid, (3) a pressure-correction method in a finite-volume integration scheme on hybrid unstructured grids, (4) a discrete vortex formulation incorporating the growing core size or core spread method to model diffusion of vorticity, (5) a velocity-vorticity method using a hybrid Eulerian–Lagrangian vortex-in-cell method with LES, diffusion computed on a grid, and convection of vorticity by discrete vortices. In individual test cases, maximum computed cross-flow responses were between 23 % and 160 % of measured values, and there was a much wider range in ratios of predicted to measured curvatures. Overall, average ratios of predicted to measured cross-flow responses were between 59 % and 106 % for the 5 different codes, and those for maximum in-line deflections between 71 % and 109 %. Predicted curvatures in either direction were on average between 30 % and 170 % of the measured values...|$|E

50|$|The piston {{carriage}} {{would open}} and then close the valve:To {{the underside of}} the first carriage in each train is attached the piston and its appurtenances; a rod passing horizontally from the piston is attached to a connecting arm, about six feet behind the piston. This connecting arm passes through the continuous groove in the pipe, and being fixed to the <b>carriage,</b> imparts <b>motion</b> to the train as the tube becomes exhausted; to the piston rod are also attached four steel wheels, (two in advance and two behind the connecting arm,) which serve to lift the valve, and form a space for the passage of the connecting arm, and also for the admission of air {{to the back of the}} piston; another steel wheel is attached to the carriage, regulated by a spring, which serves to ensure the perfect closing of the valve, by running over the top plates immediately after the arm has passed. A copper tube or heater, about ten feet long, constantly kept hot by a small stove, also fixed to {{the underside of the}} carriage, passes over and melts the surface of the composition (which has been broken by lifting the valve,) which upon cooling becomes solid, and hermetically seals the valve. Thus each train in passing leaves the pipe in a fit state to receive the next train.|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of computerised planar <b>motion</b> <b>carriages</b> (CPMC) offered many advantages to researchers {{making use of}} captive model testing for investigating ship manoeuvring.

Nevertheless {{it is still not}} clear in which way optimal use can be made of the possibilities of this experimental equipment in the determination of acceleration derivatives occurring in a ship's mathematical manoeuvring model, especially in shallow water conditions and low speed values. In order to overcome some disadvantages of conventional PMM sway testing, an alternative way of determining sway acceleration derivatives was introduced. A series of captive model tests has been executed using ship models with varying block coefficients - among which a model of the Esso Osaka - to examine the influence of test parameters on the acceleration derivatives of lateral force and yawing moment during pure sway and yaw motions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. There {{is a need}} of wear process {{modeling}} in the wheel-rail system. This {{is related to the}} fact that the wear processes in this system are absolutely different in the initial and final stages. The profile change of rail and, especially, of the wheels caused by the wear significantly affects the rolling stock dynamics, traffic safety and the resource of the wheels and rails. Wear modeling and the traffic safety evaluation requires the accounting of the low frequency component forces (including the modeling of transitional areas) affecting the wheel on the side of the rail and <b>carriage</b> in <b>motion</b> of rolling stock, so the statistical analysis is not possible. Methodology. The method of mathematical modeling of the wheel set and the rail interaction was used during the research conducting. Findings. As a result of the modeling of the wheel set motion on the rail track, the mathematic model with 19 freedom degrees was obtained. This model takes into account the axle torque and studies wheels constructions as the components of the mechanical systems, consisting of a hub and tire. Originality. The mathematic model allows evaluating the wear degree of the wheels and rails when using on the rolling stock not only all-metal wheel sets, but also compound ones with the use of spring wheels and independent rotation of semi-axes with the wheels. Practical value. The development of the improved mathematical model of freight car wheel set motion with differential rotation of the wheels and compound axles allows studying the wear processes of wheels and rails...|$|R

50|$|Although the Safavid Shah ʿAbbās I {{strongly}} condemned tobacco use, {{towards the}} end of his reign smoking ḡalyān and čopoq (q.v.) had become common at every level of society. In schools and learned circles, both teachers and students had ḡalyāns during lessons. Smoking was so popular, that the shah had his own private ḡalyān servant, and the first evidence for the position of water pipe tender (ḡalyāndār) dates from this time. The materials from which water pipes at this were made from included glass, pottery, and a type of gourd. Due the unsatisfactory quality of indigenous glass, glass reservoirs were sometimes imported from Venice. In the time of Shah Solaymān in the late 15th and early 16th century, ḡalyāns became more elaborately embellished as their use increased. The wealthy owned gold and silver pipes, and even the general population spent more on ḡalyāns than they did on the basic necessities of life.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of liquid cargo (crude oil and LNG) {{from a larger}} ship (the ship to be lightered, STBL) to a smaller vessel (service ship) when both ships are moored {{to each other and}} sail at a (slow) constant forward speed is known as lightering. These ship to ship operations are expected to increase in the near future and are expected to take place in harsher environmental conditions (polar regions). In order to better understand the hydrodynamic phenomena involved in this specific manoeuvre, a knowledge-building project with user involvement entitled “Investigating Hydrodynamic Aspects and Control Strategies for Ship-to-Ship Operations” was carried out in 2007 – 2011. As a part of this project, more than two thousand captive model tests were carried out at the towing tank for manoeuvres in shallow water (co-operation Flanders Hydraulics Research — Ghent University) in Antwerp, Belgium. A model of a very large crude oil carrier (VLCC) was attached to the main frame of the towing carriage and a model of an Aframax tanker was attached to the computer controlled planar <b>motion</b> <b>carriage.</b> Forces, moments and vertical positions were measured on both models. This paper covers the analysis of the extensive model test data reported by Lataire et al. (2009 a) and the influence of different parameters on the manoeuvre. Particular attention is paid to the forces and moments induced on the service ship by the proximity of the ship to be lightered. A mathematical model of lightering manoeuvres for both the service ship and the ship to be lightered is derived. This model can be implemented in a ship manoeuvring simulator for training purposes...|$|R
50|$|A {{towing tank}} is a basin, several metres wide and {{hundreds}} of metres long, equipped with a towing carriage that runs on two rails on either side. The towing carriage can either tow the model or follow the self-propelled model, and is equipped with computers and devices to register or control, respectively, variables such as speed, propeller thrust and torque, rudder angle etc. The towing tank serves for resistance and propulsion tests with towed and self-propelled ship models {{to determine how much}} power the engine will have to provide to achieve the speed laid down in the contract between shipyard and ship owner. The towing tank also serves to determine the maneuvering behaviour in model scale. For this, the self-propelled model is exposed to a series of zig-zag maneuvers at different rudder angle amplitudes. Post-processing of the test data by means of system identification results in a numerical model to simulate any other maneuver like Dieudonné spiral test or turning circles. Additionally, a towing tank can be equipped with a PMM (planar motion mechanism) or a CPMC (computerized planar <b>motion</b> <b>carriage)</b> to measure the hydrodynamic forces and moments on ships or submerged objects under the influence of oblique inflow and enforced motions. The towing tank can also be equipped with a wave generator to carry out seakeeping tests, either by simulating natural (irregular) waves or by exposing the model to a wave packet that yields a set of statistics known as response amplitude operators (acronym RAO), that determine the ship's likely real-life sea-going behavior when operating in seas with varying wave amplitudes and frequencies (these parameters being known as sea states). Modern seakeeping test facilities can determine these RAO statistics, with the aid of appropriate computer hardware and software, in a single test.|$|R
40|$|Applications of ship-to-ship {{operations}} for liquid cargo transfer, in particular for crude oil and LNG, will to be increasing in the future. Moreover, such operations {{are expected to}} take place in more severe environmental conditions. In order to {{have a better understanding of}} the hydrodynamic phenomena that are of importance for this kind of manoeuvres, a research project entitled “Investigating hydrodynamic aspects and control strategies for ship-to-ship operations” has been initiated, co-ordinated by MARINTEK (Trondheim, Norway) and supported financially by the Research Council of Norway. The main objective is to improve existing simulator based training activities for personnel involved in complex ship-to-ship operations in open seas through increased knowledge and understanding of the complex water flow between two ships operating in close proximity. As a final goal, a new generation simulation tools for ship-to-ship operations incorporating up-to-date knowledge of fluid dynamics has to be established. The project consists of four work packages: (1) Computational Fluid Dynamics; (2) Particle Image Velocimetry; (3) Mathematical models for simulators; (4) Nautical safety and control aspects. In the frame of the third work package, captive model tests are being carried out at the Towing tank for manoeuvres in shallow water (co-operation Flanders Hydraulics Research – Ghent University) in Antwerp, Belgium. While the model of an Aframax tanker is attached to the computer controlled planar <b>motion</b> <b>carriage,</b> a VLCC model is attached to the towing carriage as well. Two types of tests are considered: steady state tests, during which the main tests parameters (ships’ speed, relative longitudinal and lateral position, propeller rates, drift angle of the Aframax tanker, rudder angle) are kept constant, and dynamic tests, characterised by a varying lateral distance and/or heading. Horizontal forces and moments, propeller thrust and torque, and vertical motions are measured on both ship models, while the vertical motions of the free surface are monitored in three fixed points of the towing tank. The paper intends to give a summary of the test results, that will be used for validation of mathematical manoeuvring simulation models and CFD calculations...|$|R
60|$|A {{thousand}} unuttered thoughts hummed {{for him in}} the air {{of these}} observations; not the least frequent of which was that Sarah might well of a truth not quite know whither she was drifting. She was in no position not to appear to expect that Chad should treat her handsomely; yet she struck our friend as privately stiffening a little each time she missed the chance of marking the great nuance. The great nuance was in brief that of course her brother must treat her handsomely--she should like to see him not; but that treating her handsomely, none the less, wasn't all in all--treating her handsomely buttered no parsnips; and that in fine there were moments when she felt the fixed eyes of their admirable absent mother fairly screw into the flat of her back. Strether, watching, after his habit, and overscoring with thought, positively had moments of his own in which he found himself sorry for her--occasions on which she affected him as a person seated in a runaway vehicle and turning over the question of a possible jump. WOULD she jump, could she, would THAT be a safe placed--this question, at such instants, sat for him in her lapse into pallor, her tight lips, her conscious eyes. It came back to the main point at issue: would she be, after all, to be squared? He believed on the whole she would jump; yet his alternations on this subject were the more especial stuff of his suspense. One thing remained well before him--a conviction that was in fact to gain sharpness from the impressions of this evening: that if she SHOULD gather in her skirts, close her eyes and quit the <b>carriage</b> while in <b>motion,</b> he would promptly enough become aware. She would alight from her headlong course more or less directly upon him; it would be appointed to him, unquestionably, to receive her entire weight. Signs and portents of the experience thus in reserve for him had as it happened, multiplied even through the dazzle of Chad's party. It was partly under the nervous consciousness of such a prospect that, leaving almost every one in the two other rooms, leaving those of the guests already known to him as well as a mass of brilliant strangers of both sexes and of several varieties of speech, he had desired five quiet minutes with little Bilham, whom he always found soothing and even a little inspiring, and to whom he had actually moreover something distinct and important to say.|$|R
