40|$|The present article {{explains}} {{why it is}} important to consider newspapers’ formats and <b>content</b> <b>sections</b> in discourse analyses. It performs a comparative analysis of the choice and naming of <b>content</b> <b>sections</b> in the print and online editions of three major Norwegian newspapers published in 2010. The concept of paratexts is stressed and used as an analytical tool through a four-dimensional framework. The analysis shows that sections that appear across paper brands and platforms refer quite conventionally to specific topics and genres, whereas sections that appear solely online rather tend to highlight social functions, social roles and social actors. Through their paratexts, the online-specific sections answer questions of who and why instead of what. In this sense, there seems to be a discursive development in the principles underlying text classification and navigation, turning towards a more dialogical and person-oriented discourse online...|$|R

5000|$|With the {{enactment}} of a new cybercrimes law in June 2007 (Act on Computer Crime B.E. 2550), Thailand {{became one of the}} only countries in Asia to require its government to obtain court authorization to block Internet <b>content</b> (<b>section</b> 20). Illegal activities under the Thai cybercrimes law include inputting obscene data, forged or false data likely to cause injury to another person, the public, or national security; and data which constitutes a criminal offense relating to national security or terrorism (section 14). Criminal liability is extended to ISPs that intentionally support or consent to these illegal activities (section 15). The law creates civil and criminal liability for individuals who publicly post photographs of others that are [...] "likely to" [...] impair their reputation or expose them to shame, public hatred, or contempt (section 16).|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} <b>content,</b> <b>section</b> 2 of the Act (as it became when it {{received}} royal assent on 27 August 1881) {{introduced a new}} defence for newspaper proprietors {{in cases where the}} libel stemmed from a fair, accurate and non-malicious report of a publicly held meeting. This extension of qualified privilege was then [...] "amplified" [...] by the Law of Libel Amendment Act 1888, which in doing so repealed section 2 of the 1881 Act. Repealed at the same time was section 3 ("No prosecution for newspaper libel without fiat of Attorney General"). The Act also benefited newspaper owners insofar as it instituted provisions (section 4, 5 and 6) for the quicker (and hence cheaper) resolution of newspaper libel cases. Contrary to expectations, however, the passage of the Act correlated with an increase, rather than decrease, in the number of defamatory libel (criminal) actions being brought against newspapers. Whether the two were causally linked is not known, however.|$|E

5000|$|Originally, motion {{pictures}} were reviewed and censored under the Theatres and Cinematographs Act which was passed on 24 March 1911 and established the Board of Censors, {{the first film}} review board in Ontario. The law was originally scheduled {{to be in force}} on 1 June that year, but was postponed until at least 20 June because of an illness of Arthur Matheson who as Ontario's treasurer was responsible for appointing the new board. This {{led to the creation of}} the Ontario Board of Censors of Moving Pictures which began operations on 27 June 1911. Each film shown in the province was required to be reviewed and approved by the Board which would then apply a [...] "stamp" [...] which would be displayed on theatre screens prior to the start of the film. Films which did not include the Board's stamp could be confiscated by authorities under the new law, which conversely prevented law enforcement officials from stopping the presentation of stamped films because of the film's <b>content</b> (<b>section</b> 6). Enforcement of the stamping provisions began after 1 December 1911, following the Board's initial task of reviewing 4000 extant films.|$|E
