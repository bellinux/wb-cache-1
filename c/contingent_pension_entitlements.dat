This paper describes the internationally agreed methodology on recording of household <b>entitlements</b> under government <b>pension</b> schemes. The paper provides an overview of household <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements</b> and estimates of general government’s pension obligations in the euro area.

40|$|The annual {{amount of}} the state subsidy to {{occupational}} and private pensions in Ireland is double that previously believed and is of the same order as the total annual payments under the state flat-rate contributory and non-contributory pension schemes. We ask: does the state get value-for-money from these subsidies? To answer the question we introduce the fair value approach to value <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements.</b> The current regulatory regime is shown to be very weak, with the security of <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements</b> of those in private sector employment below that of investment grade debt (so the pension promise if tradeable would have junk status). We suggest and analyse measures to improve members` security. We recommend that an explicit percentage of the fair value of <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements</b> be made a debt on the sponsoring employer and {{that there should be}} regular disclosure to members of the level of security backing their <b>pension</b> <b>entitlement.</b> The former only gives a minor increase in security in an Irish context but the latter incentivises members to make other provision for their retirement. We conclude by suggesting that the state has a larger role to play in pension provision in Ireland in the 21 st century than it played in the last century...|$|R

30|$|The Oaxaca-Blinder {{decomposition}} {{procedure is}} used to quantify the share of different explaining factors concerning {{the development of the}} gender pension gap. For the older cohort, differences in education and employment history account for 60  % of the gender pension gap in the entitlements from individual employment, for 65  % of the difference in the statutory <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements,</b> and for 54  % of the difference in the old age incomes. The largest share of explained difference can be ascribed to the duration of full-time employment in the private sector: If older women were employed full-time in the private sector for the same duration as their male counterparts the gender pension gap would be reduced by 67  % for the statutory <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements</b> and by 55  % for the old age incomes. Even though we find distinct differences in the level of education, this explains only a relatively small amount of the gender pension gap (3 to 6  %). For the younger cohort the duration of full-time employment in the private sector contributes an even higher share than for the older cohort: If younger women were in this status for the same duration as men the gender pension gap would be reduced by 77  % for statutory <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements</b> and by 59  % for old age incomes. The increased prevalence of part-time employment for the younger cohort is also mirrored in the results. If women showed reduced levels of part-time employment comparable to their male counterparts, the gender pension gap would increase by 22  % (statutory <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements)</b> and 16  % (old age incomes). The relevant shares in the older cohort amount to 15  % and 13  %.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Since {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in Europe, unmet need for medical care has been increasing, {{especially}} in persons aged 65 or older. It is possible that public pensions buffer access to healthcare in older persons during times of economic crisis, but to our knowledge, this has not been tested empirically in Europe. METHODS: We integrated panel data on 16 European countries for years 2004 - 2010 with indicators of public pension, unemployment insurance and sickness insurance entitlement from the Comparative Welfare Entitlements Dataset and unmet need (due to cost) prevalence rates from EuroStat 2014 edition. Using country-level fixed-effects regression models, we evaluate whether greater public <b>pension</b> <b>entitlement,</b> which helps reduce old-age poverty, reduces the prevalence of unmet medical need in older persons and whether it reduces inequalities in unmet medical need across the income distribution. RESULTS: We found that each 1 -unit increase in public <b>pension</b> <b>entitlement</b> is associated with a 1. 11 percentage-point decline in unmet medical need due to cost among over 65 s (95 % CI - 0. 55 to - 1. 66). This association is strongest for the lowest income quintile (1. 65 percentage points, 95 % CI - 1. 19 to - 2. 10). Importantly, we found consistent evidence that out-of-pocket payments were linked with greater unmet needs, but that this association was mitigated by greater public <b>pension</b> <b>entitlement</b> (β=- 1. 21 percentage points, 95 % CI - 0. 37 to - 2. 06). CONCLUSIONS: Greater public <b>pension</b> <b>entitlement</b> plays a crucial role in reducing inequalities in unmet medical need among older persons, especially in healthcare systems which rely heavily on out-of-pocket payments...|$|R

30|$|Germany’s {{labour market}} {{has gone through}} many {{significant}} changes in recent years. Continuing unemployment, especially long-term unemployment; {{the expansion of the}} low-pay sector; and the increase in precarious working time patterns are all particularly problematic. To this we may add flexible forms of employment such as temporary work, self-employment, and marginal, short-term and part-time employment [37]. These processes increasingly lead to discontinuous employment histories characterised by changes in occupation, precarious employment and periods out of work [18, 29]. The result is low <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements.</b> The increasing number of women in work does help to compensate for this, but only to a limited extent, as women work predominantly part-time. Overall it is far more likely that coming generations of pensioners will have lower <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements</b> [3, 19].|$|R
40|$|Social {{security}} entitlements are {{a substantial}} source of wealth that grows in importance over the individual's lifecycle. Despite its quantitative relevance, social security wealth has been thus far omitted from wealth inequality analyses. In Germany, {{it is the}} lack of adequate micro data that accounts for this shortcoming. The two main contributions of this paper are: First, to elaborate a statistical matching approach that complements information on net worth as surveyed in the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), a population representative panel study, with information on social security wealth from the Sample of Active Pension Accounts (SAPA), a large-scale administrative dataset maintained by the German Statutory Pension Insurance. Second, we show to what extent the inclusion of social security wealth affects the level and the distribution of individual net worth as well as overall inequality. The present value of <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements</b> (including entitlements from the statutory pension system {{as well as from the}} separate system for civil servants) amounts to 5. 6 trillion Euros, which corresponds to an average of 78, 500 Euros per person - thus almost doubling the level of net worth. Compared to results based on net worth only, inequality of our amended wealth measure is about 25 percent less. Moreover, we present significant differences in <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements</b> across occupational groups with civil servants gaining most from the inclusion of public pension wealth in the extended wealth meas-ure and self-employed benefiting the least. Overall, our results provide clear indication for the relevance of including the notional wealth held in <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements</b> providing a less biased picture of the level and the socio-economic structure of wealth in Germany. Above and beyond such within-country variation, our findings may also be most relevant for comparative analyses across welfare-regimes.

30|$|In summary, we {{see that}} poverty among the elderly, {{regardless}} of its definition, is a relevant problem within society. The developments of recent years evidence {{a growing number of}} older people (65 +) affected by poverty. The question is whether unfavourable conditions will lead to continued growing poverty among the elderly in future. We can differentiate between internal and external factors here. Alongside changes in pensions levels (internal), individual employment histories and the resulting <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements</b> (external factor) are decisive for older people’s future income situation [3]. Working lives and career paths determine individual pension levels and company <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements</b> to a great extent. An individual’s capacity to save for a private pension depends decisively on their income in their professional life. We will now sketch out some striking developments in this area.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{fundamental}} changes in marriage behaviour and the typical division of labour between married spouses, the traditional form of providing survivor benefits within public pension schemes could now be seen as inequitable.

In particular, they may weaken work incentives for married women with some degree of labour-force attachment.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{interaction}} between capital income taxation and a means tested age pension {{in the context of}} an overlapping generations model, calibrated to the UK eco-nomy. Recent literature has suggested a rehabilitation of capital income taxation (Conesa et al. (2009)), predicated on the idea that capital is a complement with retirement leisure. This leads naturally to the conjecture that a publicly funded age <b>pension</b> <b>contingent</b> upon holdings of capital or capital income may have a similar e¤ect. We formalize this using a stochastic OLG model with multiple individuals di¤erentiated by labour productivity and <b>pension</b> <b>entitlement.</b> Our preliminary 8 ̆ 5 ndings suggest that a means tested pension has e¤ects similar to capital income taxation in a life-cycle context.

40|$|Pension {{systems are}} complex and diverse, so {{comparing}} them is consequently difficult. Yet there are valuable {{lessons to be learned}} from the pension experiences of other nations. International comparisons of pension systems have focused almost wholly on the fiscal aspects of ageing populations. This paper provides consistent data on <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements</b> for the 30 member countries of the OECD, allowing cross-country analysis of the adequacy and distribution of pension promises. The following section provides {{a brief description of the}} 30 retirement-income regimes and compares key parameters, such as pension eligibility ages, ceilings on pensionable earnings, contribution rates to defined-contribution schemes and accrual rates for defined-benefit plans. Section 2 sets out the methodology for and assumptions used in modelling <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements.</b> Section 3 presents replacement rates, the most commonly used indicator in pension analysis. Section 4 calculates pension wealth, the present value of the flow of <b>pension</b> <b>entitlements,</b> which captures the effects of cross-country differences in life expectancy, pension eligibility ages, and indexation of pensions in payment. The concept of weighted averages is introduced in Section 5 : a way of summarizing the main indicators across the range of individual earnings. The structure of the pension package, that is the role that different components of the retirement-income system play, is explored in Section 6. Section 7 presents a measure of the progressivity of the pension benefit formula, while Section 8 concludes. ...|$|R

40|$|Individual {{aspirations}} concerning age at retirement vary {{between and}} within countries. Aspiration toward early retirement may depend both on economic and non-economic factors.

At the individual level, it seems that health and job satisfaction are significant determinants of the desire to retire as early as possible. However, these non-economic factors only explain a limited share of the cross-country differentials due to their low level of cross-country variability. Economic factors seem to play a larger role at this cross-national level, at least for some of the countries under review. Retirement, Monetary factor, Health, Job Satisfaction...|$|R
