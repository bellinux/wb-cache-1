40|$|Walking is an {{extremely}} challenging problem due to its dynamically unstable nature. It is further complicated by the high dimensional continuous state and action spaces. We use locally weighted projection regression (LWPR) as a locally structurally adaptive nonlinear function approximator {{as the basis for}} learned <b>control</b> <b>policies.</b> Empirical evidence suggests that <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> for high dimensional problems exist on low dimensional manifolds. The LWPR algorithm models this manifold in a computationally efficient manner as it only models those states which are visited using a local dimensionality reduction technique based on partial least squares regression. We show that local models are capable of learning <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> for physicsbased simulations of planar bipedal walking. Locally structured <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> are learned from observation of a variety of different inputs including observation of human control and existing parametrized <b>control</b> <b>policies.</b> We extend the pose control graph to the concept of <b>policy</b> <b>control</b> graph and show that this representation allows for the learning of transition points between different <b>control</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{shows that}} theorems almost {{identical}} to those in statistical decision theory hold for control systems with unknown parameters in obtaining complete classes of <b>control</b> <b>policies,</b> such that <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> not in the complete set need not be considered in optimizing control systems. The paper also shows {{that some of the}} basic assumptions needed for these theorems are satisfied in most control situations. This has many implications in control problems. For example, in discussing adaptive control problems Bellman and Kalaba [1] used the assumption that they consider only <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> with Bayes property in deriving the functional equations of dynamic programming. It can now be shown, however, that the set of Bayes <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> form a complete class of <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> under certain conditions, and if sufficient statistics exist, then the set of <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> utilizing sufficient statistics forms a complete class. Thus, some assumptions which have been made arbitrarily in the past can be removed and/or justified in dealing with control systems with unknown parameters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — With {{the growth}} of Enterprises and organizations, the paper-based systems are {{replaced}} with software systems. These software systems are built to support a multitude of users {{with a variety of}} roles accessing the resources from anywhere and at any time. These operations are regulated through proper definition of Access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> (Permissions); this {{plays a major role in}} protecting the system and its resources. Initially the software developers focused solely on the customer's requirements without concentrating on access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> [1]. The later inclusion of them in the software system always created problems that resulted in financial loss, data loss and integrity loss of critical systems [2]. The significance of the Access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> has made the researchers to recommend its adoption in the early phases of the software development. Unlike olden days, today's business processes are evolving day by day. The Access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> also continually evolve to meet the organization's business needs and customer's interest. This issue is serious because if the evolving Access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> are not handled properly, the system is continuously vulnerable to data loss, financial loss and integrity loss. The existing works in the literature rarely address the approaches for handling the evolving Access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> [3]. New abstraction and approaches are needed to represent such policies specific during the software design. This paper discusses research directions that could result in approaches for handling the evolving access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> in the design phase. This should also ensure the early inclusion of the access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> at design phase...|$|R

This behavior can be described by business protocols representing the possible sequences of message exchanges. Since a lot of web services use access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> to restrict the access to authorized consumers, these policies should be part of the service description. Studying the behavior of web services by analyzing their business protocol after assigning the access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> is the main contribution of this work. Access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> will be presented using ontology which eases policy specification and management and add some flexibility in the policy comparison.

40|$|Access {{control is}} one of the most {{fundamental}} and widely used security mechanisms. Access control mechanisms control which principals such as users or processes have access to which resources in a system. To facilitate managing and maintaining access <b>control,</b> access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> are increasingly written in specification languages such as XACML. The specification of access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> itself is often a challenging problem. Furthermore, XACML is intentionally designed to be generic: it provides the freedom in describing access <b>control</b> <b>policies,</b> which are well-known or invented ones. But the flexibility and expressiveness provided by XACML come at the cost of complexity, verbosity, and lack of desirable-property enforcement. Often common properties for specific access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> may not be satisfied when these policies are specified in XACML, causing the discrepancy between what the policy authors intend to specify and what the actually specified XACML policies reflect. In this position paper, we propose an approach for conducting conformance checking of access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> specified in XACML based on existing verification and testing tools for XACML policies. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis conducts an {{intelligent}} model based analysis {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of tobacco <b>control</b> <b>policies.</b> By using the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey data, the impact of tobacco <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> on smokers’ quitting behaviour is examined in four developed countries: Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. A set of intelligent models are developed for predicting smokers’ quitting behaviour. The performance of these intelligent models is evaluated in order to select the best intelligent model for analyses. An attribute-based analysis is further conducted to investigate the underlying patterns and identify the factors that have the greatest impact on smokers’ plans to quit and their attempts to quit. Four policy drivers identified from the existing motivational attributes include: personal concerns, cigarette price, environmental restrictions and health system encouragement. They can be used to represent tobacco <b>control</b> <b>policies.</b> Outliers in the data are removed to improve the performance of the intelligent models. Results show that the derived policy drivers can fully represent the original attributes based on the performance of intelligent models using these two groups of input attributes. To evaluate the relative degrees of impact of tobacco <b>control</b> <b>policies,</b> hypothetical policy impacted populations are created to examine the variations of the quit attempt rate of smokers. Comparative studies are conducted for offering insightful analyses of impact degrees of tobacco <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> on different groups of smokers across the four countries. Results show that smokers’ health concerns and professional advice for quitting are two important factors to encourage quitting behaviour. Smoke-free policies may have a certain impact on increasing the quit attempt rate. In comparison with other tobacco <b>control</b> <b>policies,</b> the effectiveness of increasing cigarette price to reduce tobacco use is weak. Overall, this research establishes a methodological framework for modelling the complex planning process of tobacco <b>control</b> <b>policies.</b> In particular the framework can be used to measure the impact of specific tobacco <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> on smokers’ quitting behaviour across the four countries...|$|R
40|$|Commodity {{software}} components are intrinsically untrustworthy. It is highly insecure {{to use them}} directly in mission critical systems. Part of the insecurity {{can be attributed to}} the common-used but flawed mechanisms for discretionary access control, which is coarsegrained and based on user's privileges. Many alternative mechanisms have been investigated to provide mandatory access control that is fine-grained and specific to individual {{software components}}. A predominate approach to this end is to classify processes into domains and roles, and to configure access control accordingly. However, this approach has limited applications in practice due to inconvenience in its manual procedure for access control configuration. This position paper introduces a new approach to address the limitation. Our approach differentiates static from dynamic access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> such that only a small amount of access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> needs to be configured statically, and that a large amount of access <b>control</b> <b>policies</b> can be configured dynamically through automatic composition. The differentiation and composition together allow flexible and convenient management of access control, even when it is mandatory and is configured with a highly fine granularity.
