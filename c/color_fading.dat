500|$|The cap of M.californiensis is {{initially}} conic or bell-shaped, but flattens out in maturity, and typically reaches dimensions {{of up to}} [...] The cap margins (edges) are curved inwards when young, but as they age they become wavy or [...] (with rounded scallops), develop striations (radial grooves) and may even split. The surface of the cap is dull and smooth. Its color ranges from reddish brown to [...] brownish orange in young specimens, with the <b>color</b> <b>fading</b> as the mushroom matures; {{the center of the}} cap is usually darker than the margins. The flesh is thin, and either the same color as the cap or ligher; it may stain a dark red color when bruised.The gills have an [...] attachment to the stem—broadly attached slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem. They are not closely spaced together, and there are about 15–20 of them. Some of the gills do not extend the full distance {{from the edge of the}} cap to the stem. These short gills, called lamellulae, form one to two groups of roughly equal length. All of the gills have a white to pinkish-buff color, with the gill edges ranging from reddish orange to reddish brown to brownish orange. The hollow stem is [...] long by [...] thick, and roughly the same thickness throughout. The top of the stem may be either [...] (appearing to be covered with a very fine whitish powder on a surface) or smooth, while the stem base is covered with [...] "hairs" [...] that may be strigose (large, coarse, and bristle-like) to [...] (soft and fuzzy). The stem is some shade of brown. The mushroom tissue will [...] "bleed" [...] a brownish-range to reddish-brown latex when it is cut. The edibility of M.californiensis is unknown.|$|E

5000|$|The {{problem of}} film decay {{is not limited}} to films made on {{cellulose}} nitrate. Film industry researchers and specialists have found that color films (those made in the processes which replaced Technicolor) are also decaying at an increasingly rapid rate. A number of well-known films only exist as copies of original film productions or exhibition elements because the originals have decomposed beyond use. Cellulose acetate film, which was the initial replacement for nitrate, has been found to suffer from [...] "vinegar syndrome". The ongoing preservation of color films is now presented with an issue, as low temperatures, which inhibit <b>color</b> <b>fading,</b> actually increase the effects of vinegar syndrome, while higher (normal room) temperatures cause <b>color</b> <b>fading.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{improved}} 35 mm {{safety film}} {{was introduced in}} 1949. Since safety film is much more stable than nitrate film, comparatively few films were lost after about 1950. However, <b>color</b> <b>fading</b> of certain color stocks and vinegar syndrome threaten the preservation of films made since about this time.|$|E

50|$|Monochromatic {{in science}} means {{consisting}} of a single wavelength of light or other radiation (lasers, for example, usually produce monochromatic light), or having or appearing to have only one color (in compare to polychromatic).

50|$|White LEDs {{can be used}} {{as white}} holiday lights or to create any other color through the use of colored {{refractors}} and lenses similar to those used with incandescent bulbs. <b>Color</b> <b>fading</b> may occur due to the exposure of colored plastics to sunlight or heat, as with ordinary holiday lights. Yellowing may also occur in the epoxy body in which the LED is encased if left in the sun consistently.|$|E

50|$|The tail on {{this species}} is heavily armored with five rings of spines forming {{longitudinal}} ridges. Males {{of the species}} grow to a length of 35 cm whereas females attain 18.5 cm. Like most Ctenosaura the iguanas are born a bright green <b>color</b> <b>fading</b> to brown as the animal ages. The females tend to turn a uniform drab brown in color, and males develop tones of black, blue and yellow on their bodies and heads over the brown background.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of LEDs: colored LEDs and white LEDs. Colored LEDs emit a {{specific}} color light (monochromatic light), regardless of the color of the transparent plastic lens that encases the LED's chip. The plastic may be colored for cosmetic reasons, but does not substantially affect the color of the light emitted. Holiday lights of this type do not suffer from <b>color</b> <b>fading</b> because the light is determined by the LED's chip rather than the plastic lens.|$|E
50|$|Psathyrella piluliformis is {{a species}} of agaric fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae. It {{produces}} fruit bodies (mushrooms) with broadly convex caps measuring 2 - 5 cm in diameter. The caps are chestnut to reddish brown, the <b>color</b> <b>fading</b> in age and with dry weather. The closely spaced Gills have an adnate attachment to the stipe. They are initially tan until the spores mature, when the gills turn dark brown. Fragments of the partial veil may remain on the cap margin, and as a wispy band of hairs on the stipe. Fruiting occurs in clusters {{at the base of}} hardwood stumps.|$|E
