There’s very little Donald Trump has done or said that Francis didn’t champion a quarter century ago.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>clear</b> <b>now</b> {{that the}} present {{situation}} cannot be allowed to continue. It is evident also that the Stormont government {{is no longer in}} control of the situation. Indeed, the present situation is the inevitable outcome of the policies pursued for decades by successive Stormont governments. It is clear also that the Irish Government can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse. It is obvious that the RUC is no longer accepted as an impartial police force. Neither would the employment of British troops be acceptable nor would they be likely to restore peaceful conditions, certainly not in the long term. The Irish Government have, therefore, requested the British Government to apply immediately to the United Nations for the urgent dispatch of a Peace-Keeping Force to the Six Counties of Northern Ireland and have instructed the Permanent Representative to the United Nations to inform the Secretary General of this request. We have also asked the British Government {{to see to it that}} police attacks on the people of Derry should cease immediately.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} on the website Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, [...] "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] is an alternative metal and gothic metal song, set in common time and performed in moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. It is written in the key of F# minor and Lee's vocals for the song range from the musical note of A#3 to G5. According to IGN's Ed Thompson, Lee sings the lines [...] "It's true we're all a little insane/But it's so <b>clear</b> <b>now</b> that I'm unchained", with her [...] "haunting vocals". Some critics found dark lyrics like [...] "I dream in darkness, I sleep to die, erase the silence, erase my life, our burning ashes darken the day, a world of nothingness, blow me away" [...] accompanied with [...] "rumbling guitars" [...] and a string section. A writer for the website Sputnikmusic found similarities between the songs on Fallen and [...] "Sweet Sacrifice". The main theme for the song is getting over from an abusive relationship. Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian concluded that Lee sings the lines [...] "You know you live to break me" [...] and [...] "Are you still too weak to survive your mistakes?" [...] to Evanescence's past guitarist Ben Moody. That sentiment was echoed by Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone, {{who said that the}} lyrics [...] "One day I'm gonna forget your name/And one sweet day, you're gonna drown in my lost pain" [...] are aimed at Moody.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by Paul R. Brown was filmed in Burbank, California between March 9 and March 10, 2007. The music video leaked onto the Internet on April 4, 2007, after briefly being available for digital download on iTunes Store. It initially premiered on Yahoo! Music on April 5. The video was {{compared with the}} psychological thriller film directed by Tarsem Singh, The Cell (2000). Lee said that the main inspiration is [...] "like we're in the walls of our minds, sort of". During an interview with MTV News, she further revealed {{the concept of the}} video, [...] "It's mostly live performance. It's not so much fluff and flying and tricks and wolves and stuff. It's more really just about the song, and that is unique for us. We usually do crazy stuff. It's gonna be sort of like a video within the video. Since the song is our heaviest single, we really wanted to focus on mostly performance but still have something about it that's really unique. And I think [...] really {{hit the nail on the}} head." [...] The video starts with Lee laying on a couch and as the song progresses, she starts singing the lyrics [...] "It's true, we're all a little insane, but it's so <b>clear</b> <b>now</b> that I am unchained" [...] while getting up from it. She wears a red dress and [...] red make-up on her face. Later another scenes, show her singing in a room similar to The Cell, while the band is performing in another room.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin {{was best}} {{described}} as an agnostic. Her lack of religious faith apparently did not stem from anyone's influence, rather from her own inquisitive mind. She developed her scepticism as a young child. Her mother recalled that she refused {{to believe in the}} existence of god, and remarked, [...] "Well, anyhow, how do you know He isn't She?"

50|$|As visitation to the Paluma Range increased, {{lobbying}} for the gazettal of a township continued, {{and with the}} head of works on the road still two miles from Paluma, the first auctions of lots were held in December 1934.

2500|$|Several {{songs from}} the album would later be sampled by other artists. Kanye West's song [...] "Stronger" [...] from the album Graduation {{features}} a vocal sample of [...] "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger". [...] "Stronger" [...] was later performed live at the 2008 Grammy Awards with Daft Punk in their trademark pyramid while Kanye West was on stage rapping.

2500|$|In 1954, the 42-rank Moller organ was {{installed}} in the main auditorium. The $50,000 for the organ had been donated by the Grand Lodge of New Jersey in 1930. The marble staircases {{between the first and}} second floors were also completed, and the fifth floor with its Royal Arch Masonry room was almost finished as well. The memorial association now began reconsidering some of its plans. It was <b>clear</b> <b>now</b> that there was no need for a [...] "States Remembrance Room" [...] on the fourth floor, and that the eighth floor did not have enough space to hold all the Washingtoniana in the possession of the Alexandria-Washington Lodge. [...] So the association resolved to make the fourth floor a Washington museum, while leaving the eighth floor open.|$|E

40|$|Studies on the {{relationship}} between infl ammation and tumor {{can be traced back to}} the 19 th century.

5000|$|The musical {{direction}} {{was also}} <b>clearer</b> <b>now</b> {{and could be}} described as high energy punk rock with noise and melodies.

60|$|Shortly afterwards, Dick {{went down}} {{the bank of the}} gutter and began to wade across.
