5|$|Flann {{was chosen}} as the High King of Ireland, also known as King of Tara, {{following}} the death of his first <b>cousin</b> <b>and</b> stepfather Áed Findliath on 20 November 879.

Flann was more successful than most kings of Ireland. However, rather than the military and diplomatic successes of his reign, it is his propaganda statements, in the form of monumental high crosses naming him and his father, as kings of Ireland, that are exceptional.|$|E
