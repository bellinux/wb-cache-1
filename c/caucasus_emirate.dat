25|$|Since 2000, Russia {{has also}} {{experienced}} {{a string of}} suicide bombings that killed hundreds {{of people in the}} Caucasian republics of Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia, as well as in Russia proper including Moscow. Responsibility for most of these attacks were claimed by either Shamil Basayev's Islamic-nationalist rebel faction or, later, by Dokka Umarov's pan-Islamist movement <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> which is aiming to unite most of Russia's North Caucasus as an emirate since its creation in 2007. Since the creation of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate,</b> the group has abandoned its secular nationalist goals and fully adopted the ideology of Salafist-takfiri Jihadism which seeks to advance the cause of Allah on the earth by waging war against the Russian government and non-Muslims in the North Caucasus, such as the local Sufi Muslim population, whom they view as mushrikeen (polytheists) who do not adhere to true Islamic teachings. In 2011, the U.S. Department of State included the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> on its list of terrorist organisations.|$|E
25|$|In February and March 2011, Russian law {{enforcement}} agencies conducted special operations against members of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> in Ingushetia, during which they arrested several associates of Magomed Yevloyev, including Islam and Ilez Yandiyev.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{investigation}} {{indicated that}} the bombings were perpetrated by the militant Islamist <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> group. On March 31, <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> leader Doku Umarov claimed responsibility for ordering the attacks in a video released on the internet. He also stated that such attacks in Russia would continue unless Russia grants independence to Muslim states in the North Caucasus region. The man who brought the suicide bombers to Moscow was arrested in July 2010. The Anti-Terror Committee of Russia confirmed in August 2010 that Magomedali Vagabov, along with four other militants, {{was killed in an}} operation in Dagestan. He is believed to be a militant behind the bombings, a close associate of Doku Umarov and the husband of Mariam Sharipova, one of the two suicide bombers.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, Suleimanov {{rejoined the}} insurgency, {{where he would}} serve as both the Qadi of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate's</b> Vilayat Dagestan branch, and the {{military}} commander of Vilayat Dagestan's Mountain Sector, which included his home village of Gimry.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010 Shameyev was {{identified}} as the Emir of the Chegem sector west of Nalchik, but he would then be promoted to Emir of the entire southwestern sector of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate's</b> Vilayat of Kabarda, Balkaria and Karachay.|$|R
50|$|Rustam Asildarov (Aselderov) (9 March 1981 - 3 December 2016), {{also known}} as Emir Abu Muhammad Kadarsky, {{was the leader of}} the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) North Caucasus branch, and a former leader of the militant <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate's</b> Vilayat Dagestan wing.|$|R
25|$|Some {{commanders of}} the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> in Chechnya and Dagestan {{switched}} their allegiance to ISIL in late 2014 and early 2015. On 23 June 2015, ISIL spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani accepted the pledges of allegiance and {{announced a new}} Caucasus Province (Wilayat al-Qawqaz) {{under the leadership of}} Rustam Asildarov.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> {{immediately}} denied {{responsibility for}} the attack, saying that they planned attacks on economic targets inside Russia, but not against civilians. However, the attack followed a warning from Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov the prior month of his intent to spread the Caucasian insurgency to Russian cities.|$|E
25|$|The Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, {{the former}} separatist {{government}} in exile (which split {{from the other}} half which would become the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> in 2007), released a statement sending condolences to the victims, suggesting the attackers may have been desperate, traumatized and hopeless, and strongly condemning the bombing.|$|E
50|$|In June 2011, {{in a video}} {{released}} on the internet, a silent Byutukayev appeared {{at the side of}} Dokka Umarov, as the latter claimed responsibility for the assassination of Yuri Budanov, a former Russian Colonel, who kidnapped, murdered and allegedly raped an 18-year-old Chechen girl during Second Chechen War.In July 2011, {{at a meeting of the}} <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate's</b> Sharia Court, Umarov appointed Byutukayev to his deputy in the newly created Western Sector of Vilayat Nokhchicho.|$|R
50|$|In late 2014, the Saudi-dominated faction Green Battalion swore {{allegiance}} to JMA leader Salahuddin Shishani and {{became part of}} the group. In mid-2015, Shishani was deposed from the leadership following an internal dispute with the Saudi head of JMAâ€™s sharia committee, Mu'atassim Billah al-Madani. Al-Madani subsequently became the new leader of JMA, while Shishani and his North Caucasian loyalists formed a new independent group called Jaish al-Usrah, and swore {{allegiance to}} the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate's</b> then leader, Magomed Suleymanov.|$|R
50|$|Asildarov {{grew up in}} the Kadar {{region of}} the Buynaksky District in Russia's {{republic}} of Dagestan. During the late 1990s, the area became a regional center of Salafism and had de facto independence, before military operations in September 1999 brought it back {{under the control of the}} Russian state. Asildarov became the leader of Vilayat Dagestan's Central Sector in May 2010, and on 8 August 2012, <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate's</b> leader, Dokka Umarov, appointed Asildarov as the overall leader of Vilayat Dagestan, following the death of Ibragimkhalil Daudov.|$|R
25|$|On 11 November 2013, {{four men}} {{received}} jail terms for the offences including commissioning {{an act of}} terror, murder and attempted murder. Islam and Ilez Yandiyev and Bashir Khamkhoyev were sentenced to life terms in a penal colony, while Akhmed Yevloyev was jailed for 10 years as he was a minor {{at the time of}} the attack. The government's investigators said that the bombing was carried out by Magomed Yevloyev, Akhmed's brother, on the orders of the leader of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate,</b> Doku Umarov. The convicted were accused of sheltering the bomber in Nazran, Ingushetia, providing him with money and putting him on a bus to Moscow in preparation for the attack. The investigators also said that his attack was plotted at a camp run by the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> in Ingushetia.|$|E
25|$|The Mujahideen of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> Province of Dagestan, the Caucasian Islamist {{organization}} in both Chechnya and Dagestan, denied any {{link to the}} bombing or the Tsarnaev brothers and stated that it was at war with Russia, not the United States. It also said that it had sworn off violence against civilians since 2012.|$|E
25|$|Umarov {{denied that}} Chechen {{separatism}} {{is linked to}} al-Qaeda or any other international jihadi groups, saying that the rebels' priority is liberty and independence from Russia and peace for the Caucasus. Prior to his 2007 declaration of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate,</b> Umarov was commonly viewed as a staunch Chechen nationalist and had been expected to rather curb the pan-Islamist tendencies in the Chechen separatist movement.|$|E
5000|$|Nevertheless, on 17 February, the Russian {{state agency}} RIA Novosti agency wrote that Zakayev {{allegedly}} announced his intentions {{to return to}} Chechnya and [...] "work for a lasting peace" [...] in the republic. According to the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate's</b> mouthpiece Kavkaz Center, Zakayev, who may be granted amnesty, stated his readiness to return and [...] "contribute to a long-term peace in the region" [...] in an interview for Ekho Moskvy on the same day. Kavkaz Center - which supports Umarov - has called Zakayev [...] "the head of a telephone government," [...] referring {{to the fact that}} Zakayev has little influence on the insurgents on the ground.|$|R
50|$|On 9 June 2010, the Russian {{authorities}} {{announced that}} Taziev {{had been captured}} after voluntarily giving himself up to Ingush police. Russian state media reported that subsequent successes in eliminating prominent insurgent commanders {{in the spring of}} 2011 were likely due to Taziev's knowledge of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate's</b> leadership being tapped by his FSB interrogators.3 years after the announcement of his capture, Taziev's trial began on 13 May 2013 in front of a Russian court in Rostov-na-Donu. On 21 June 2013, the head of Ingushetia, Yunus-bek Yevkurov, appeared at the trial as a victim and a witness. Russian media showed footage of Taziev and Yevkurov debating with each other, with Taziev refusing to ask for forgiveness for anything he is accused of, saying instead that he would only ask for pardon from God. In October 2013, he was sentenced to life imprisonment on terrorism charges.|$|R
50|$|The Chechen-led Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar (JMA), {{which was}} said to be {{cooperating}} with the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front, was mid 2013, according to The Washington Free Beacon, one of the leading recruiters of foreign fighters into the jihad in Syria to fight Assad. Its online forum {{was said to}} show an easy access route, via Turkey, to the battlefield, which brought in more fighters. The Free Beacon also reported that Chechen fighters were bringing with them Russian-made SA-7 anti-aircraft missiles which are shoulder-fired and could be used to target civilian commercial airliners. JMA cut it links to ISIL in late 2013, and continued respecting the Oath of Allegiance they had made to the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate's</b> Dokka Umarov. In September 2015, JMA joined the al-Nusra Front. Besides JMA, numerous other small factions and groups involving Russian-speaking foreign fighters, including some with links to the North Caucasus, are active in parts of Syria and Iraq. One of the more powerful Chechen-dominated militias in Syria was Junud al-Sham, but it fractured in course of 2016. Since then, Ajnad al-Kavkaz has become the most important independent rebel group led by North Caucasians in Syria. The group's leadership consists of Second Chechen War veterans.|$|R
25|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, after Chechnya's first war against Russia, Movladi Udugov's status as war hero {{enabled him to}} take the post of the {{breakaway}} Republic's Security Minister. Between 2006 and 2007, following the death of his predecessor Sheikh Abdul Halim, Umarov became the underground President of Ichkeria of the unrecognized government of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, the post that Umarov eventually abolished himself when he renounced and abandoned Chechen nationalism in favour of regional pan-Islamism and jihadist ideology. The political mantle of Chechen nationalist separatism was formally taken over by the self-exiled Akhmed Zakayev, Umarov's former wartime comrade and friend turned political rival. Having quit the position of Chechen separatist leader, Umarov subsequently became the self-proclaimed Emir of the entire North Caucasus region of Russia, declaring it a putative Islamic state of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate.</b> In 2010, Umarov abortively resigned from the position and appointed Aslambek Vadalov as the new Emir of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate,</b> but soon afterwards issued a statement annulling the previous declaration and stating he would remain in his position and rebel Sharia court ruled in favour of Umarov over the rift, following which most other Russian rebel leaders re-swore allegiance to him.|$|E
25|$|This trend {{ultimately}} {{resulted in}} the October 2007 declaration of <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> by Doku Umarov where he also urged for a global Jihad, and the political schism between the moderates, and the radical Islamists fighting in Chechnya and the neighbouring regions with ties in the Middle East. Some commanders, still fighting along with Doku Umarov, like Anzor Astemirov, have publicly denounced {{the idea of a}} global Jihad, but keep fighting for the independence of Caucasus states.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the region}} has since been far from stable, separatist {{activity}} has decreased, though some foreign fighters remain active in Chechnya. In {{the last months of}} 2007, the influence of foreign fighters became apparent again when Dokka Umarov proclaimed the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> being fought for by the Caucasian Mujahadeen, a pan-Caucasian Islamic state of which Chechnya was to be a province. This move caused a rift in the resistance movement between those supporting the Emirate and those who were in favour of preserving the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.|$|E
5000|$|On 23 July 2011, {{the rebel}} website Kavkaz Center stated that a {{ruling by the}} <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate's</b> Sharia Court had {{resolved}} the nearly year-long dispute between the transnational Islamists led by Umarov and a significant segment of the more localized, traditional anti-Russian Chechen irredentists led by Gakayev. Following the month-long court proceedings, Umarov re-appointed Gakayev his naib (deputy) in the eastern sector of Chechnya, while Vadalov and [...] "a number" [...] of Chechen field commanders who had earlier renounced their bayat (allegiance) instead renewed their loyalty to Umarov. Noticeably absent from the gathering was Gaziyev, and an appeal from Umarov to [...] "mujaheds in the North Caucasus and Chechnya...to put behind you all the disagreements that existed between us and direct all your strength, all your will toward elevating the word of Allah and against our enemy the unbelievers," [...] implied that some Chechen fighters, possibly including Gaziyev and the men he commands, still refuse to acknowledge Umarov's title of supreme commander. In naming Aslan Byutukaev (Emir Khamzat) commander of the western sector of Chechnya, Umarov also abolished the southwestern front previously run by Gaziyev until his dismissal {{in the fall of}} 2010, further evidence that Gaziyev is not presently a part of the reconciliation.|$|R
25|$|Many {{details of}} the clash, the most deadly in Georgia since the 2008 South Ossetia war, still remain unclear. The governments of Georgia and Russia, as well as Russia's Islamic insurgents of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> that abortively claimed that the shadowy armed group belonged to their main forces in Dagestan, accused each other of a provocation. The {{incident}} was also lambasted by Georgian then-opposition (winner of the October 2012 election) coalition Georgian Dream, who accused Saakashvili's United National Movement government of lying about it and promised that {{those responsible for the}} deaths would be punished.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} that Doku Umarov had planned to follow the Domodedovo attack with two additional bombings in Moscow. An attack in Moscow's Red Square was planned for New Yearâ€™s Eve, 2011, but it was foiled when the suicide bomber accidentally triggered the bomb {{in a hotel room}} in Kuzminki District, killing herself in the explosion. Another bombing was to be carried out by a Slavic Russian couple who had converted to Islam, and become members of <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate.</b> However, they were unable to leave Dagestan, and instead committed two separate suicide bombings in the village of Gubden on 14 February 2011, killing two policemen and injuring 27 people.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the fall}} of Grozny and the Russian push into the highlands, Gelayev {{personally}} led {{the defense of the}} mountain village of Shatoy, where he was wounded several times. Mumadi Saidayev then took over the command of the front. During this battle, on May 27, 1995, Gelayev announced that if the aerial bombing of the village continued, a number of captive Russian military aviation officers would be killed every day and, according to the Russian human rights group Memorial, eight Russian POWs were executed as Gelayev carried out this threat. The later President of Ichkeria (and still later the self-proclaimed leader of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate)</b> Dokka Umarov initially served under his command, together with Akhmed Zakayev, before they left it to form their own units.|$|E
25|$|On 18 March 2014, Umarov's {{death was}} {{reported}} by the Caucasus Emirate-associated Islamist website Kavkaz Center, which offered no details but did say his death was confirmed by the Command of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate.</b> He was announced {{to be replaced by}} the Caucasus Emirate's senior Sharia judge Ali Abu Mukhammad, who then officially confirmed the death of Umarov in a video posted on YouTube. Previously, Umarov had been reported killed or captured by Russian forces on numerous occasions, but all these reports later turned out to be incorrect. According to a report posted on Kavkaz Center, Umarov was poisoned on 6 August 2013 and died at dawn on 7 September 2013. On 25 September 2017, Russian media reported that the body of Umarov had possibly been found in a remote mountainous area in Ingushetia.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{abolition}} of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and the proclamation of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> {{by the president of the}} separatist movement Dokka Umarov, the conflict in Chechnya and the rest of the North Caucasus is often referred to as the [...] "War in the North Caucasus". The Russian government has given no new name to the conflict while most international observers still refer to it as a continuation of the Second Chechen War.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> is a {{fundamentalist}} Islamic terrorist group residing {{primarily in the}} North Caucasus of Russia. Created from {{the remnants of the}} Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI) in October 2007, it adheres to an ideology of Salafist-takfiri jihad [...] that seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate within the North Caucasus and Volga region (primarily the republics of Tatarstan and Bashkortostan). Many of their fighters are also present in jihadist battlegrounds such as Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, and throughout Central Asia. Many plots involving Chechen and other indigenous ethnic groups of the North Caucasus have also been thwarted in Europe over the recent years.|$|E
2500|$|The bombings {{were the}} latest in a series of attacks in Russia since 1994, many {{attributed}} to Chechen militants or to the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate.</b> Since 1999, Chechen separatists gradually shifted away from a pro-western approach of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, becoming strongly influenced by Salafi beliefs which placed them at odds not only with Russia and Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, but also with a Dagestani population with strong Sufi traditions. A mujahideen group claim they are fighting a [...] "holy war", and wish to create an [...] "Emirate" [...] in the Caucasus. Over 5,000 people have been killed and wounded in the Caucasus since 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Since 10 March 2011, Umarov {{has been}} on the United Nations Security Council's Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee list of {{individuals}} allegedly associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban for [...] "participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf of, or in support of, recruiting for, supplying, selling or transferring arms and related materiel to and otherwise supporting acts or activities of" [...] his own organizations (the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> and its Brigade of Martyrs suicide attack wing) as well as Uzbekistan's Islamic Jihad Union and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 February 2011, a {{faction of}} the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> led by Doku Umarov claimed {{responsibility}} for the attack, and threatened further attacks. In the video in which Doku Umarov {{claimed responsibility for the}} bombing, he took the opportunity to lash out, calling the major powers in the world [...] "satanic". He criticised the US and Russia for being hypocrites, reasoning that if they actually followed their own principles, they would have to surrender world power to China, due to the senior status of Chinese culture and religion. He said, according to the logic of Russia and America, [...] "China should then rule the world. They have the largest and most ancient cultures". He also attacked the USA, Russia, Britain, and Israel for oppressing Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|On September 7, the Chechen {{language}} department of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Radio Marsho, {{reported that it}} had been contacted by a <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> representative calling himself Abu Khamza, who stated: [...] "All the necessary information is being gathered now. There should be a thorough investigation into the causes that led to such consequences. Only then we can make an official statement with conclusions and assessments of what happened." [...] Chechen secular separatist leader Akhmed Zakayev said that his Chechen Republic of Ichkeria's government-in-exile has already established [...] "a special committee" [...] to investigate the causes of the incident. Zakayev said that [...] "regardless of whether the Georgian side will cooperate with us or not, we have the appropriate resources to the reveal the truth. Afterwards, the Chechen legitimate government will express its position." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{his return}} to the U.S., Tsarnaev created a YouTube channel with {{playlist}} links to two videos which were tagged under a category labeled [...] "Terrorists", including one to Dagestani Islamic militant Amir Abu Dujana (Gadzhimurad Dolgatov, also known as 'Robin Hood', a commander of a small group in the Kizilyurt district, who was killed in battle in late December 2012); the videos were later deleted. CNN and the SITE Institute found a screen grab of one of the videos, which featured members of the militant Islamist group <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> from the North Caucasus. He also linked to jihadi videos on YouTube, including ones by radical cleric Feiz Mohammad; in one video, voices can be heard singing in Arabic as bombs explode. He frequently read extremist sites, including Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's Inspire online magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Doku Umarov was {{regarded}} as the most-wanted man in Russia and was put by the Russian police on Interpol's international wanted list. In March 2008, Chechnya's chief prosecutor, Valery Kuznetsov, launched a criminal case against Umarov for [...] "inciting inter-ethnic hatred and calling for {{the overthrow of the}} Russian government on the Internet" [...] (the penalty for this being just a fine of up to 500,000 rubles and a ban on holding management positions). According to Kommersant, Umarov was earlier on Russia's wanted list, but all the previous and much more serious charges against him (involvement in acts of terrorism, kidnappings for ransom, murders and robberies) were suspended in 2005. [...] The paper noted that the Zakayev-led Chechen spearatist government in exile was investigating Umarov for [...] "attempting to liquidate the independent Chechen state" [...] by declaring the creation of the <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate.</b> The Caucaus Emirate itself has been officially labeled by Russia as a terrorist organization since January 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{analysis}} of the attack {{saw it as a}} [...] "very painful blow" [...] against both Kadyrov and Moscow. Earlier in the month, a quartet of top insurgent field commanders - including Aslambek Vadalov - had renounced their oaths of allegiance to <b>Caucasus</b> <b>Emirate</b> supreme leader Dokka Umarov in order to continue to fight for Chechen independence rather than a pan-Islamic state encompassing the entire North Caucasus; whereas many commentators expected this to weaken the insurgency, the Tsentoroy attack proved decisively that the Chechnya-based fighters were still {{a force to be reckoned}} with. Also in early August, Kadyrov made the outlandish claim that there were a [...] "maximum [...] seventy" [...] Islamist militants remaining in Chechnya; not only did the operation clearly refute that, but it also showed that the rebels still had strategists experienced enough to plan and coordinate a three-pronged attack as well as the types of mid-level commanders capable of carrying it out with minimal casualties.|$|E
