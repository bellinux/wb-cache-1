40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential of pre-treatment techniques to produce high quality back-sawn boards from regrowth messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua L'Herit), which is very prone to <b>collapse</b> and <b>checking.</b> Saturated urea solution, one percent sodium hydroxide, four percent acetic acid, water, urea formaldehyde resin (UF), and polyvinyl acetate glue (PVA) were used. In Chapter 4, the experiment of chemical soaking pre-treatments showed that soaking in sodium hydroxide solution for up to 15 days caused almost double increase of boards' drying rate. However, this technique and soaking in acetic acid solution caused more <b>collapse</b> and <b>checks.</b> In Chapter 5 and 6, the surface coating experiment confirmed that coating with UF resin did not significantly improve the drying properties of the boards. In contrast, PVA coating prevented surface checking and considerably reduced edge <b>checking</b> and <b>collapse.</b> The <b>check</b> value of these P boards was only a quarter the check value of control boards. In Chapter 6, the pre-treatments trial proved that significant reductions of shrinkage and collapse were achieved mainly by urea soaking for eight weeks (SSW boards). Both tangential and radial shrinkages of S 8 W boards were {{less than half the}} shrinkages of control boards. The collapse free boards of S 8 W were almost double amount of that in control boards. However, this pretreatment caused more surface checks. One-day urea soaking followed by eight weeks close stacking (C treatment) reduced checking. The check free boards of C, W, and P were 38...|$|R

40|$|Eucalyptus nitens is a {{hardwood}} plantation species used in cool-temperate {{regions of}} the world. It is mainly used for pulp and paper, although there is increasing interest in using this species for producing high quality appearance and structural timber products. Therefore breeding programs {{need to consider the}} requirements of different markets and breed for a variety of end-uses. The aim of this thesis is to study the genetic control of E. nitens wood properties. The focus is on three different product groupings which are pulp and paper, appearance grade timber, and structural grade timber. Pulp and paper traits studied were wood density, cellulose content, fibre length and fibre coarseness; appearance grade timber traits were <b>collapse,</b> <b>checking</b> and decay; and structural grade timber traits were stiffness and microfibril angle. Genetic parameters and potential genetic gains were estimated using data from 12 year old E. nitens progeny trials grown on three sites. Wood properties were sampled using 12 mm cores taken at a height of approximately 1 metre. Relationships between whole tree wood density and core wood density, and whole tree pulp yield and core cellulose content were investigated. For both traits core samples were good predictors of whole tree values. Methods were developed to assess wood collapse and decay using wood cores. All wood properties except fibre coarseness had significant genetic variation, with heritabilities ranging from 0. 38 to 0. 56. The heritability for stem diameter was 0. 39. Genetic correlations between traits were mostly significant and reasonably high. Adverse correlations occurred between diameter and density, diameter and collapse, diameter and stiffness, and between density and cellulose. Favourable correlations occurred between diameter and cellulose, density and collapse and between density and stiffness. Genotype by environment interactions were sometimes present but were always small. Genetic selection can significantly improve the quality of wood produced for pulp and paper, appearance grade timber and structural grade timber. Of particular importance are the potential gains in <b>collapse</b> (or <b>checking)</b> and stiffness, where genetic selection can potentially lift the quality grades of appearance and structural products. Selecting a deployment population for high decay resistance may minimise the risk of value loss on sites known to have severe decay problems. Breeding goals for all product groupings are reasonably well correlated and improved product quality can be achieved in all product groupings without the need for specialised breeds. Selecting for wood density, as well as growth rate, is a minimum requirement if high grades of timber are to be produced...|$|R

We derive "weaken" versions of both theories in which we use the whole equilibrium coarse-grained distribution function as a constraint instead of the total energy constraint. We use these weaken theories to construct expressions for the conditional probability K_i(τ) that a test particle initially at the phase-space coordinate τ would end-up in the i'th macro-cell at equilibrium. We show that the logarithm of the ratio R_ij(τ) ≡ K_i(τ) /K_j(τ) is directly proportional to the initial phase-space density f_ 0 (τ) for the Lynden-Bell theory and inversely proportional to f_ 0 (τ) for the Nakamura theory.

40|$|Characterization of mass {{transfer}} properties was {{achieved in the}} longitudinal, radial, and tangential directions for four Australian hardwood species: spotted gum, blackbutt, jarrah, and messmate. Measurement of {{mass transfer}} properties for these species was necessary to complement current vacuum drying modeling research. Water-vapour diffusivity was determined in steady state using a specific vapometer. Permeability was determined using a specialized device developed to measure {{over a wide range}} of permeability values. Permeability values of some species and material directions were extremely low and undetectable by the mass flow meter device. Hence, a custom system based on volume evolution was conceived to determine very low, previously unpublished, wood permeability values. Mass diffusivity and permeability were lowest for spotted gum and highest for messmate. Except for messmate in the radial direction, the four species measured were less permeable in all directions than the lowest published figures, demonstrating the high impermeability of Australian hardwoods and partly accounting for their relatively slow drying rates. Permeability, water-vapour diffusivity, and associated anisotropic ratio data obtained for messmate were extreme or did not follow typical trends and is consequently the most difficult of the four woods to dry in terms of <b>collapse</b> and <b>checking</b> degradation. © The State of Queensland, Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, 2012...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} {{finite element models}} and subsequent sensitivity and reliability analyses to evaluate the probability of disproportionate collapse of a twelve-storey case study Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) building, following extreme loading events such as earthquakes. As an initial damage, the methodology mimics event - independent scenarios that include a sudden removal of a vertical loadbearing element. This investigation emphasises on the rotational stiffness (k) of the joints by considering nonlinear dynamic analyses of the structure at global, component and connection levels. The rotational stiffness demand required to prevent disproportionate <b>collapse</b> is <b>checked</b> against the supply {{at all levels of}} structural idealisation. A sensitivity analysis at the sub - frame level shows that an improved structural detailing, to carry tie forces between structural members, as well as adequate thickness of structural elements, are important to prevent disproportionate collapse. The reliability analysis of the optimised structural model proves that the required k value, to develop resistance mechanisms, is too large to be practically achieved by means of common CLT joint detailing, which is provided by angle brackets and screws. As a result, connection detailing and size of members of the case study building need to be re-evaluated in order to avoid disproportionate collapse in the twelve-storey CLT building...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Seismic {{fortification}} intensity {{has been}} adjusted {{in some areas}} which were affected in The Wenchuan-earthquake. It was seismic strengthening {{for most of the}} buildings especially the public buildings after the adjustment. In order to ensure the seismic performance of the structure after reinforcement, the analysis method based on performance is gradually applied in the large and complex engineering structure analysis. The paper uses a large span Sports Training Center under construction as background. According to the situation that the fortification intensity by 6 degrees improved to 7 degrees, the paper uses Push-over method to analysis elastic-plastic of the finite element models,which including the mild steel damper before and after reinforcement,under the action of the rare earthquake of 7 degrees. The paper is studying the internal force,deformation and destruction of the structure in the action of the rare earthquake, comparing the dynamic characteristics and seismic performance of the models, and researching distribution of weak links and plastic hinge of the models under the large earthquake. The results show that the models can meet <b>collapse</b> resistant <b>checks</b> less than 7 degrees of the rare earthquake before and after reinforcement.

Standards have introduced severe limits to guarantee the energy saving in new buildings; however, {{there is a significant}} need of retrofitting existing buildings, because of their large impact on the real estate in continents like Europe. In the framework of a FP 7 European project, a multilayer prefabricated façade panel is proposed as an outdoor solution. It is characterized by an internal EPS layer, 100 mm thick and by two external layers made of textile reinforced concrete (TRC), 12 mm thick. The insulating material is also used to transfer the shear between the external TRC layers. The maximum size of the panel is 1. 50 x 3. 30 m 2; the panel height is properly chosen in order to fasten it to the frame concrete beams. In the paper the design of the panel and the results of tests performed on full scale panels are resumed.

30|$|The {{structural}} non-linear buckling {{static analysis}} was conducted as a buckling and plastic <b>collapse</b> design <b>check.</b> Non-linear analysis required some modifications to the tower model {{that was used in}} the elastic static analysis. The main modifications were to include both geometric imperfections and material non-linearities in the model. The geometric imperfections were included to act as a perturbation to initiate buckling. These imperfections represent the geometric imperfections present in the real structure. In order for the structure to be acceptable, geometric imperfections must be within certain tolerances as specified by the fabrication part of the relevant design code. For the work presented in this paper, two methods were used to create the imperfections in the tower model. In the first method, the mode shapes from an eigenvalue buckling analysis were used to pre-deform the structure. In the second method, an amount of deformation was imposed on the main members, mid-span between the horizontal members. This created an imposed imperfection similar to a sinusoidal form. Limits on the values of imperfections were based on Eurocode 3 [26]. Measurements of out-of-straightness imperfections were made on the actual tower structure. During measurements, the main members were the main focus. The unsupported length for the tower’s main members is 2.5  m, and the out-of-straightness was within the range of 5 to 8  mm. Eurocode 3 [26] requires these imperfections to fall within a length given by L/ 300 (8.3  mm in this case), where L is the unsupported length. Material non-linearity was introduced in the constitutive equations for the tower. The material was modelled as elastic perfectly plastic, exhibiting a linear stress–strain relationship up to the yield point, with a plastic modulus equivalent to zero slope beyond that point.|$|R

40|$|Flooding in the Yellow River basin (YRB) {{has changed}} {{significantly}} {{over the last}} few decades because of climate change and human activities. Determining how the flooding changed and identifying the main driving factors of flood change is crucial to flood risk assessment and water resources planning. However, few studies have been conducted, especially in the whole YRB. To fill this gap, we investigate the spatial and temporal change of the annual maximum flood (AMAXF) in the YRB using observed data from 32 key hydrological stations (including 15 mainstream stations and 17 tributary stations). The Mann-Kendall test combined with trend index method is used to evaluate the trend in precipitation and AMAXF. The trend results indicate the AMAXF over the whole basin is dominated by decreasing trends: 72 % of the stations exhibit significant decreasing trends (at 0. 1 significance level) and 22 % of the stations show no significant decreasing trends in the AMAXF. Both flood trends and abrupt change time exhibit obvious regional differences: the flood decreases is more pronounced in the midstream basins than in the headwater of the basin; the abrupt changes mainly occurred in the early 1990 s for the upper reaches, and in the late 1990 s for the middle reaches. To investigate the causes of flood change, the trends of precipitation extremes are analyzed in relation to the trends of peak floods. The analysis reveals that the decreasing precipitation extremes only results in the AMAXF reduction in the upstream basin. The decreasing AMAXF in the midstream and downstream of the basin are mainly attributable to the impacts of human activities (mainly including dam construction and soil conservation practices). In general, anthropogenic impacts play an increasingly important role in the AMAXF changes in the YRB. According to the possible changes in forcing factors, the AMAXF over the whole basin is expected to further decrease in the near future. However, there are still large flood risks in the tributary basins due to the <b>collapse</b> of <b>check</b> dams caused by extreme storms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, large gully control {{programmes}} have been established in Ethiopia. Based on detailed observations and measurements of 400 check dams in the highlands near Hagere Selam (Tigray, northern Ethiopian Highlands), {{the effectiveness of the}} check dam technique was assessed. In this study, catchment area, slope gradient, technical characteristics and the presence of smectite clays are the main factors controlling dam stability. Simple and logistic regression techniques were used to analyse the data. The frequent collapse of dams (39 % after two years) is strongly associated with drainage area (A) and slope gradient of the soil surface near the gully (S), the product of these factors (S X A) being a proxy for runoff energy. Good functioning dams have a spillway, apron, concave plan form (when looking downslope) and are built at vertical intervals and with heights that result in a negative slope gradient of the line connecting the spillway and the foot of the upstream dam. Therefore, a reverse slope of this line is recommended. Furthermore, if large cracks arc present in smectite-rich soils, the construction of check dams can lead to piping and concentrated flow bypassing the dam. Given that the <b>collapse</b> of some <b>check</b> dams seems inevitable where catchment areas are large or there are steep slopes, it is necessary to repair dams as soon as partial collapse starts and to complement this gully control technique with biological control measures. status: publishe...|$|R

Longitudinal growth stresses varied widely among trees, resulting in log end-splitting and sawlog flitch movement during sawing (spring), which led to crook in sawn timber, substantially reducing timber conversion in some trees. <b>Collapse</b> and internal <b>checking</b> were prevalent in air-dried lumber, and numbers of checks varied widely among trees. Face-checking was found in boards from all trees after kiln-drying and reconditioning, and even those with very few face checks had internal checks. Veneer thickness varied unacceptably, caused probably by incorrect knife- and pressure-bar settings. Veneer splitting also varied among trees, and was worse in butt-log than in second-log veneers. Unsatisfactory pre-heating of billets before peeling may have exacerbated splitting. Knots severely downgraded structural plywood veneer grades, < 8 % of sheets from the second logs being acceptable compared with 87 % of sheets from the pruned butt logs. Stiffness of veneer sheets was successfully measured using a sonic device (Pundit™) to sort veneers for manufacture of laminated veneer lumber...|$|R
30|$|Unlike {{the global}} {{plantation}} estate, eucalypts and other hardwood species {{account for only}} 2 % of the New Zealand plantation area, which is dominated by Pinus radiata D.Don (radiata pine) (90 %) (MPI 2016). Interest in establishing commercial eucalypt plantations {{dates back to the}} late nineteenth century with the introduction and testing of many eucalypt species around that time (Barr 1996; McWhannell 1960; Miller et al. 1992; Miller et al. 2000; Shelbourne et al. 2002; Simmonds 1927). Their work identified various Eucalyptus species that suit New Zealand conditions. However, today E. nitens (H.Deane & Maiden) Maiden is the only Eucalyptus species that is currently grown commercially on a large scale. There are more than 10, 000  ha E. nitens in Southland and Otago (in the southern South Island), but the species suffers from fungal and insect attack in the warmer North Island (McKenzie et al. 2003; Miller et al. 1992). Some small commercial plantings of E. fastigata H. Deane & Maiden and a small amount of E. regnans F.Muell. can also be found (Miller et al. 2000). The development of these three species is supported by breeding programmes: E. nitens (Telfer et al. 2015); E. fastigata (Kennedy et al. 2011); and E. regnans (Suontama et al. 2015). Eucalyptus nitens is currently grown for chip wood export for the pulp industry. Generally, it is possible to manufacture quality LVL from 15 -year old E. nitens, which was reported to have an average MoE of 14.3  GPa and achieving F 17 grade according to AS/NZS 2269 (2012) (Gaunt et al. 2003). This compares favourably to the majority of radiata pine LVL products manufactured in New Zealand, the MoE of which range between 8 and 13  GPa, and which relies on using {{the better part of the}} radiata pine resource. Apart from growth-stress, E. nitens has been reported to suffer from <b>collapse</b> and internal <b>checking</b> during drying (Lausberg et al. 1995; McKenzie et al. 2003; McKinley et al. 2002).|$|R
