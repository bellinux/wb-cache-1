5|$|Digital {{radio in}} the United Kingdom is being {{promoted}} by radio stations and the broadcasting industry {{on the premise that}} it provides superior quality sound over AM, a wider choice of radio stations, is easier to use, and is resistant to the interference which other broadcast media are susceptible to. On the other hand critics say that coverage is not yet sufficient and the quality <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than that of FM.|$|E

Distinguishing between Lactarius and Lactifluus based on morphology alone is quite difficult, as clear synapomorphies for both genera {{have yet to be}} identified. Most field guides treat the two genera together, often because Lactifluus is not yet recognised as a separate genus.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{test results}} {{support the view that}} {{congenital}} amusia is hereditary. It is likely to be influenced by several genes that interact to increase an individual's susceptibility to its development. However, the fact that the offspring have a lower risk of developing congenital amusia shows that it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> prevalent when the musical environment is enriched. This stresses the importance that experience-dependent tuning has in the musical pitch system.|$|E
25|$|Most {{developing}} countries have abundant renewable energy resources, including solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy, and biomass, {{as well as}} the ability to manufacture the relatively labor-intensive systems that harness these. By developing such energy sources {{developing countries}} can reduce their dependence on oil and natural gas, creating energy portfolios that are less vulnerable to price rises. In many circumstances, these investments <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> expensive than fossil fuel energy systems.|$|E

25|$|Flow cytometry {{has several}} {{advantages}} over IHC including: {{the ability to}} define distinct cell populations by their size and granularity; the capacity to gate out dead cells; improved sensitivity; and multi-colour analysis to measure several antigens simultaneously. However, flow cytometry <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> effective at detecting extremely rare cell populations, {{and there is a}} loss of architectural relationships {{in the absence of a}} tissue section. Flow cytometry also has a high capital cost associated with the purchase of a flow cytometer.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the frequency, waveguides can be {{constructed}} from either conductive or dielectric materials. Generally, the lower the frequency to be passed the larger the waveguide is. For example, the natural waveguide the earth forms given by the dimensions between the conductive ionosphere and the ground {{as well as the}} circumference at the median altitude of the Earth is resonant at 7.83Hz. This is known as Schumann resonance. On the other hand, waveguides used in extremely high frequency (EHF) communications <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than a millimeter in width.|$|E
25|$|The term {{can also}} {{refer to the}} {{miniature}} neon glow lamp, developed in 1917, about seven years after neon tube lighting. While neon tube lights are typically meters long, the neon lamps <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than one centimeter in length and glow much more dimly than the tube lights. They are still in use as small indicator lights. Through the 1970s, neon glow lamps were widely used for numerical displays in electronics, for small decorative lamps, and as signal processing devices in circuity. While these lamps are now antiques, the technology of the neon glow lamp developed into contemporary plasma displays and televisions.|$|E

25|$|Radiation fog {{is formed}} by the cooling of land after sunset by {{infrared}} thermal radiation in calm conditions with a clear sky. The cooling ground then cools adjacent air by conduction, causing the air temperature to fall below the dew point, forming fog. In perfect calm, the fog layer <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than a meter thick, but turbulence can promote a thicker layer. Radiation fogs occur at night, and usually doesn't last long after sunrise, but it can persist all day in the winter months especially in areas bounded by high ground. Radiation fog is most common in autumn and early winter. Examples of this phenomenon include the Tule fog.|$|E
25|$|Accuracy {{can always}} be {{improved}} with greater computational cost. Significant errors can present themselves in ab initio models comprising many electrons, due to the computational cost of full relativistic-inclusive methods. This complicates the study of molecules interacting with high atomic mass unit atoms, such as transitional metals and their catalytic properties. Present algorithms in computational chemistry can routinely calculate the properties of molecules that contain up to about 40 electrons with sufficient accuracy. Errors for energies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than a few kJ/mol. For geometries, bond lengths can be predicted within a few picometres and bond angles within 0.5 degrees. The treatment of larger molecules that contain a few dozen electrons is computationally tractable by approximate methods such as density functional theory (DFT).|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} puberty can have {{important}} {{psychological and social}} consequences. Early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends. They have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports. Pubescent boys often {{tend to have a}} good body image, are more confident, secure, and more independent. Late maturing boys <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers. However, early puberty is not always positive for boys; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them. Because they appear older than their peers, pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms; society may view them as more emotionally advanced, despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance. Studies have shown that early maturing boys {{are more likely to be}} sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors.|$|E

25|$|Each team plays {{each other}} team twice, once {{at home and}} once away making a total of 26 matches. Games start out as 50 over matches but if rain affects play they {{can be reduced to}} a minimum of 20 overs. The method for working out reduced targets is to take 3/4 of the first innings run rate off the first innings score for every over that is lost in the second innings. One over is lost for every 7 minutes in the first innings and every 3½ minutes in the second innings. The second innings <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> than 20 overs as long as there were more than 20 overs bowled in the first innings and the team batting second believe they can chase the full total posted in the first innings or the team bowling second believe they can bowl their opponents out in the {{allocated}} overs. If the team batting second get the full total then they win. If the team bowling second bowl out the team batting second then they win. If neither team does this then it is a No Result. For example, Lowerhouse scored 124–7 off their allocated 31 overs. Nelson opted to chase 125 for victory off 12 overs. They ended up on 82–7 so neither team won and it was a no result. 10 points are awarded for a win, 7 points for a tie, 3 points for a no result and 2 points for bowling the opposition out. Up to 5 bonus points are then awarded to the team who lost. If the team that lost bowled second they get 1-point for 5 wickets, 2 for 6 wickets, 3 for 7 wickets, 4 for 8 wickets and 5 for 9 wickets. If they batted second they get 1-point for being within 50 runs, 2 points for being within 40 runs, 3 points for being within 30 runs, 4 points for being within 20 runs and 5 points for being within 10 runs. 1 point is deducted for slow over rate in an innings of more than 40 overs. One over is expected to be bowled in 3¾ minutes. One bowler may bowl up to 17 overs while no other bowlers may bowl more than 14 overs.|$|E
