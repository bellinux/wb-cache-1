40|$|AbstractUsing {{conventional}} grinding wheels, wheel-sided chatter vibration {{is one of}} {{the limiting}} factors in terms of productivity and surface fin-ish. Initial vibration related to the dynamic behavior of the machine tool copy on the grinding wheel and its amplitude amplifies by abra-sion. To ensure high workpiece quality many expensive truing cycles are needed. In this context, we suggest a new set-up for the auto-matic chatter detection and elimination for external <b>cylindrical</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>machines,</b> reducing not only the high amount of true running cycles, but also improving the efficiency. In order to suppress the generation of the waviness on the grinding wheel the effect has to be identified during an early stage of its development. Therefore, a <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> is equipped with different types of sensors, i. e., eddy current, force, acoustic emission, acceleration sensors, and a tactile probe. Experimental results show, that exclusively measuring the displacement at the workpiece is sufficient for online computing wheel's waviness. Based on a model of the grinding process the other redundant sensors are used for validation. In addition, a robust online chatter detector based on the wavelet transformation is developed recognizing an instable grinding process. This model-based detection and estimation of waviness delivers solid results, it should be used for suppression of chatter in further work...|$|R
40|$|At present surface {{roughness}} {{is one of}} the main indications of component quality. During the operation mainly the outer layer of the component is exposed to external action, and depending on the roughness structure conclusions can be drawn about the service properties of the surface. Because <b>cylindrical</b> <b>grinding</b> today is rather widely used and precise method of treatment of bodies of revolution in the field of mechanical engineering the given paper pays attention to the surfaces treated on <b>cylindrical</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>machines,</b> and more exactly to their roughness, determining the possible use of the given surfaces. For the analyses of the roughness parameters the ISO standard ISO 25178 - 2 : 2012 ”Geometrical product specifications (GPS) — Surface texture: Areal — Part 2 : Terms, definitions and surface texture parameters” was used, in which there were determined the texture parameters of the surface. Contrary to other standards, such as ISO 4287, ISO 13565 the new standard allowed to assess real surface properties, since in the given case the surface is being viewed in three-dimension space. During the research three cylindrically ground samples treated at different cutting conditions were chosen. By the help of modern measuring equipment Taylor Hobson Talysurf Intra 50 the topography of the given samples was taken in order to obtain and compare the roughness parameters and for the purpose of setting relation between the cutting regime and roughness parameters, and determining mathematical model of cylindrically ground samples. As a result of research it was stated that the given type of surfaces is characterized by irregular roughness, that is location of micro-peaks regarding their height and shape are irregular and also the correlation function of cylindrically ground surfaces is rapidly diminishing, but the density distribution of ordinates is close to normal.

40|$|Investigating {{high-speed}} {{grinding up}} to 500 m/s had to await {{new developments in}} wheel design, machine design and a balancing system. An efficient realisation of cutting speeds up to 500 m/s requires wheel diameters from 200 mm to 350 mm and spindle speeds of 30. 000 r. p. m. Recording of the vibration behavior of available high-frequency spindles revealed that balancing of the spindle/ grinding wheel system is practical only at operating speed. Power measurements at different peripheral speeds and with various wheel diameters have shown that {{a sharp increase in}} the power losses can be measured particulary in the supersonic range. This occurs because of increasing air friction losses at the surface of the rotating wheel. The smallest possible wheel diameter should always be selected. In addition, there are power losses due to the use of a coolant and wheel cleaning.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{is developed}} for optimal infeed control of cylindrical plunge grinding cycles. Unlike conventional cycles having a few sequential stages with discrete infeed rates, the new methodology allows for continuous {{variation of the}} infeed rate to further reduce the cycle time. Distinctive characteristics of optimal grinding cycles with variable infeed rates were first investigated by applying dynamic programming to a simulation of the grinding cycle. The simulated optimal cycles were found to consist of distinct segments with predominant constraints. This {{provided the basis for}} an optimal control policy whereby the infeed rate is determined according to the active constraint at each segment of the cycle. Accordingly, the controller is designed to identify the state of the cycle at each sampling instant from on-line measurements of power and size, and compute the infeed rate according to the optimal policy associated with that state. The control system to implement the optimization policy is proposed together with provisions to enhance robustness to modeling uncertainty and measurement noise. Robustness provisions include model adaptation by parameter estimation from on-line measurements of size and power, and incorporation of safety margins in the optimization process. Problems associated with practical implementation of the control system, stemming from power limitations and wheel wear, are also discussed.

The motivation of this work is to measure in situ process parameters using integrated sensors in a workpiece in order to characterize the manufacturing process.

40|$|Nowadays {{machining}} {{in manufacturing}} industry {{has become more}} competitive and demanding than ever before. Grinding {{as one of the}} last stages in the manufacturing process {{has been the focus of}} the research studies in the field of manufacturing for quite some time. Grinding process compared to the other machining operations involves in low rates of material removal. The thermal, metallurgical, and mechanical phenomena coupled with the grinding process, make the contact dynamics unpredictable and complicated; hence the grinding wheel life and cycle times cannot be determined from any available standard tables and charts. This is due to the fact that, a large number of parameters are influencing each other in a grinding process. During a grinding process there are undesirable experiences that can be included as thermal effects, chatter vibration, rapid grinding wheel wear, etc. In order to overcome these problems associated with the grinding process a correct understanding of the involving factors in the process is of great significance. This thesis work is focused on design and implementation of a bench scale plain type <b>cylindrical</b> <b>grinding</b> <b>machine</b> for grinding of the rolls in plunge and traverse cut in the laboratory environment.

Nonlinear friction effect as one of the major disturbances affecting the motion control systems is identified for the in-feed axis of the machine tool based on LuGre model. A novel method for grinding force estimation by monitoring of the thrust force in the infeed axis is presented based on the identified friction. The implementation of such an approach benefits the low cost compared to the common methods which use the dynamometer sensors for condition monitoring of the grinding process. A traverse grinding cut model is presented in succeeding chapter to show how this type of vibration can give rise to the grinding force value and make it unstable.
