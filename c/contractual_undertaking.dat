The High Court granted an interdict enforcing a <b>contractual</b> <b>undertaking</b> not to use loud-speaking equipment to broadcast calls to prayer from a suburban mosque. An undertaking not to use any amplification equipment had been given by the respondent in 1986, in the deed of the sale of the land on which the mosque was built. Despite the contract, the respondent started broadcasting amplified calls to prayer through a loudspeaker, and the applicants applied for an interdict to stop it.|$|E

The issues in tort are analyzed through the traditional elements of the action – duty of care, standard of care, proximity, and recognizable loss. Under contract law, the authors examine {{the problems associated with}} consideration and mental capacity when problem gamblers sign a <b>contractual</b> <b>undertaking</b> to be excluded from casinos and other gaming venues. Many of the references cited in this work relate to the Province of Ontario because an earlier article (and report) on the issue of problem gambling posited that Ontario’s gaming venues owed a duty of care to problem gamblers.

40|$|Although {{there is}} no 2 ̆ 2 typical 2 ̆ 2 {{franchise}} contract, the franchise purchaser, or franchisee, is usually required to pay a fee {{for the privilege of}} opening a franchise outlet, and must then rely upon the franchise seller, the franchisor, to provide guidance and support in the operation of the enterprise.

The focus of recent concern over franchising practices has not involved the objection to particular contract provisions so much as the desire to insure that the investing franchisee is aware of the true nature and scope of the risks he is undertaking.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{discusses}} {{what is the}} scope of Umbrella Clauses. State undertakings must satisfy the condition of being investment. That is the first requirement of applicability of investment regime to state undertakings. Despite state undertakings was seen as wide concept (by some tribunals) {{the language of the}} clause and prevailing view support undertakings must be limited to contractual undertakings (in practice some viewed that Umbrella Clause can be extended to municipal law obligations)). However, for the purpose of attribution of contracts under international law, states must be involved. But international obligation only arises when state abuses its <b>contractual</b> <b>undertaking.</b> When contracts are concluded by private parties, the investor must demonstrate that that private party was exercising the element of governmental function when it entered into on behalf of particular state. And also, breach must arise from the exercising of granted public function. This will narrow the types of contractual undertakings to licenses, concessions or stabilization clauses. This means, even though certain commercial contracts can qualify to be an investment does not necessarily elevate these kind of contracts under international law. Because of absence of any exercising of governmental function while entering into such contracts. Those contracts nature just commercial and investor will provide some service for certain amount of pay...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{dissertation}} analyses {{the reasoning}} and verdicts {{of local and}} foreign Courts in cases where a complaint is made that the separate legal personality of a company is abused by a director in order to breach fiduciary duties or escape contractual obligations. In this dissertation contractual obligations {{are discussed in the}} context of contracts in restraint of trade on directors. The facts, law and the judgment of the Court shall be stated in each of the cases analysed. This analysis of the cases shall be confined to instances where a director of company A incorporates company B to use it to breach fiduciary duties he/she owes to company A and where a director has a <b>contractual</b> <b>undertaking</b> to company C but incorporates company D and trades though it thereby escaping restraint of trade obligations owed to company C. The separate legal personality of a company principle is not absolute in law but a general rule hence the exception of piercing of the corporate veil is discussed. The discussion on piercing of the corporate veil commences by first discussing what piercing of the veil actually means and thereafter proceeds to explain the principles applicable in piercing the corporate veil and finally the application of the piercing principles to the various cases discussed. In the analysis of cases where the Courts (local and foreign) adjudicated matters of abuse of separate legal personality of a company by directors, the Courts at times find it unnecessary to disregard the separate existence of a company’s personality but rather elect to identify the company with the director. Notwithstanding the known common law guidelines in English and South African jurisprudence for piercing the corporate veil such as façade, sham, fraud and alter ego, the United Kingdom Supreme Court in a recent case of Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd 1 has streamlined the guidelines into two main principles being the evasion and concealment principles [...] .

40|$|Recent {{strategy}} {{literature suggests}} that intangible resources [...] in particular competencies and relationships [...] are critical drivers of competitive advantage. However, {{there seems to be}} a lack of understanding of when certain types of competencies and relationships are most critical. This paper introduces a framework consisting of three fundamental levels of resource-competition. The framework is illustrated through the pharmaceutical industry. We argue that (1) biotech firms mainly engage in entrepreneurial competition; (2) traditional pharmaceutical firms [...] here referred to as big-pharma [...] increasingly <b>undertake</b> <b>contractual</b> competition and, finally, (3) generic drug makers compete predominantly operationally. The paper argues that intangible resources contribute differently to competitive advantage depending on level of competition. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the bargaining power of the accommodation providers (APs) of the Republic of Cyprus (ROC) when <b>undertaking</b> <b>contractual</b> and non-contractual negotiations with large European tour operators (TOs). Within a tourism and hospitality context there was an insufficient understanding regarding bargaining power, its antecedents, influencing factors and the implications for negotiation in business-to-business (B 2 B) buyer-supplier relationships. Bargaining power is embedded in B 2 B buyer-supplier exchanges, where parties engage in negotiations to exchange resources {{in order to achieve}} their organisational objectives and survive. A qualitative inductive approach was followed and an epistemological interpretivist Grounded Theory methodology and design adopted, combining elements from two versions of Grounded Theory: evolved and classic. Qualitative primary data were collected in two stages: an exploratory stage and a main stage. The exploratory stage was undertaken to better understand the contextual characteristics of the tourism and hospitality industry in the ROC and the actors involved and guide the main stage of primary data collection. Sixteen semi-structured interviews, using a purposive convenience sampling technique, were conducted in the exploratory stage. The main primary data collection stage used purposive snowballing sampling and forty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted. Grounded Theory’s techniques were employed to analyse the data. This study has made contributions to knowledge, theory and practice. First, in terms of contributions to knowledge this study has extended the bargaining power concept within a tourism and hospitality context. As a result, it has advanced current knowledge of power relations between B 2 B buyers and suppliers. In addition, extending the resource-dependence perspective in the tourism and hospitality context assisted in determining dependence patterns that can influence various aspects of B 2 B buyer-supplier relationship, including negotiations. This study has also contributed to knowledge by advancing understanding regarding the role of emotions in B 2 B buyer-supplier negotiations. Further, it has contributed to B 2 B pricing management knowledge by identifying that B 2 B pricing in tourism buyer- supplier negotiations is also influenced by culture, relative bargaining power and relational factors (emotions) and relationship constructs, and not solely by rationality and market characteristics as frequently accepted by economic models. Second, a contribution was made to theory through the development of a substantive theory combining three core categories, resources, relational factors and market characteristics, in order to fully explain the bargaining power interactions in negotiations between tourism buyers and suppliers, from the weaker party’s perspective. Third, the practical contribution was made in terms of the explanation of bargaining power interactions and the implications for the contractual and non- contractual negotiations of the APs with the TOs. This knowledge can aid perceived weaker parties such as APs to take more informed decisions in negotiations as well as to better manage their relationship with the large perceived powerful TOs. These were developed into recommendations for APs, TOs and Government...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} {{is based on}} works carried out in 5 distinct phases throughout a career at the University of Surrey spanning 36 years but with a 20 month gap in 1982 where I worked at Wimpey Laboratories undertaking research work on lightweight concretes. Initially, I was employed on an EPSRC NETCEM contract awarded to Prof Dave Hannant and Dr Jeff Keer where I developed and tested {{a replica of the}} Big 6 asbestos cement sheet. There was then a period where I was then employed on an advanced polymer composites contract awarded to Prof Len Hollaway. Although I had no specific technical knowledge of advanced polymer composites at this time I did have considerable expertise in conventional engineering materials and in experimental techniques. Within the period of this contract I gained sufficient knowledge and understanding to co-author a follow up contract. Additionally, I was able to contribute to the supervision of experimental techniques and the numerical modelling of structures undertaken by the PhD students in the research group at that time. Once taken on as a member of staff, albeit on a <b>contractual</b> basis, I <b>undertook</b> supervision and co-supervision of contracts that I had co-authored. I also applied for EPSRC starter funding available at the time. Whilst the application was not successful, Prof Len Hollaway and I were invited to take the principles of the application for reinforcing and strengthening conventional construction materials further and to expand them into a full application where we were subsequently awarded an EPSRC contract. Prof Len Hollaway and I were also requested by Prof Chris Clayton (then Head of Civil Engineering) to include other members of staff onto our contract applications. The first application included Prof Gerry Parke (then Reader in the Department of Civil Engineering) and the second application included a new member of staff Dr Toula Onoufriou (Reader in the Department of Civil Engineering). Both EPSRC applications were successful and resulted in fruitful contracts. We further included other new members of staff, albeit not successfully, on EPSRC applications for novel composite concrete beam configurations for which I took the principal investigator roll. I have since taken a proactive roll in investigating new areas of research, firstly with a PhD studentship in Electronic Engineering with Prof Graham Reed (then Reader in Silicon Wave Guide Applications in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering) and then with the Composites Group in the Materials Department. This link with Prof Steve Ogin incorporated Graham’s expertise for our investigations into measurements in composite materials and then damage detection in composite materials. The major thrust in all of the work throughout this latter period of my career has been in the development and application of FRP composites through research into aspects of applied physics, optoelectronics, materials science and engineering and structural mechanics. It has been made possible through grants and contracts to which I have acted as co-investigator and co-supervisor of PhD students. This has been through both my own research effort and through my participation in an inter-disciplinary research group of staff in the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences spanning across the underpinning engineering disciplines. For the first 16 years, I was the primary member of this group with specific expertise in numerical modelling and simulation of engineering structures under mechanical and environmental loading conditions. Whilst I have been the primary lead in these areas over this period it has always been necessary to choose the Principal Investigator carefully to suit the funds applied for. In this early stage of the development into the research area we have been investigating fundamental materials research based on the formative crack density work conducted by Prof Steve Ogin, Prof Paul Smith and Dr Lynne Boniface. It was thus necessary to install Steve as the Principal Investigator over either Graham or myself for the applications to be successful...|$|R
