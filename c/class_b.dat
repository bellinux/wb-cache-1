5|$|In 1896, Adolph Ochs bought The New York Times, a money-losing {{newspaper}}, {{and formed}} the New York Times Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger family, {{one of the}} United States' newspaper dynasties, has owned The New York Times ever since. The publisher went public on January 14, 1969, trading at $42 a share on the American Stock Exchange. After this, the family continued to exert control through its ownership {{of the vast majority}} of <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> voting shares. Class A shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights while <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> shareholders are allowed open voting rights.|$|E
5|$|In biochemistry, {{heavy metals}} are {{sometimes}} defined—on {{the basis of}} the Lewis acid (electronic pair acceptor) behaviour of their ions in aqueous solution—as <b>class</b> <b>B</b> and borderline metals. In this scheme, class A metal ions prefer oxygen donors; <b>class</b> <b>B</b> ions prefer nitrogen or sulfur donors; and borderline or ambivalent ions show either class A or B characteristics, depending on the circumstances. Class A metals, which tend to have low electronegativity and form bonds with large ionic character, are the alkali and alkaline earths, aluminium, the group 3 metals, and the lanthanides and actinides. <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> metals, which tend to have higher electronegativity and form bonds with considerable covalent character, are mainly the heavier transition and post-transition metals. Borderline metals largely comprise the lighter transition and post-transition metals (plus arsenic and antimony). The distinction between the class A metals and the other two categories is sharp. A frequently cited proposal to use these classification categories instead of the more evocative name heavy metal has not been widely adopted.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{recommended}} that the FAA revise the procedures for ATC facilities {{in the area to}} facilitate the process for VFR traffic that wishes to transit <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> airspace. This included establishing procedures to coordinate such requests between facilities; requiring controllers to instruct pilots to self-announce on the VFR corridor frequency if they are unable to immediately enter <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> airspace; adding information to area Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcasts reminding pilots to use the self-announce frequency; and ensuring that pilots are provided with traffic advisories if they are in contact with a controller.|$|E

5|$|The Nashville Baseball Club {{was formed}} as a charter member of the newly {{organized}} <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> Southern Association in 1901. The team did not receive their official moniker, the Nashville Volunteers, until 1908. However, the team was, and is, {{commonly referred to as}} the Vols. Their last season in the Southern Association was 1961. After sitting out the 1962 season, the Vols returned for a final season {{as a part of the}} South Atlantic League in 1963. Over their 62-year existence, the Vols competed at four class levels: <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> (1901), Class A (1902–1935), Class A1 (1936–1945), and Double-A (1946–1961, 1963). They served as a farm club for eight major league teams.|$|E
5|$|The mouse {{reference}} genome has {{at least}} 21 distinct Mup genes (with open reading frames), and a further 21 Mup pseudogenes (with reading frames disrupted by a nonsense mutation or an incomplete gene duplication). They are all clustered together, arrayed side by side across 1.92 megabases of DNA on chromosome 4. The 21 functional genes have been divided into two sub-classes based on position and sequence similarity: 6 peripheral Class A Mups, and 15 central <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> Mups. The central <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> Mup gene cluster formed {{through a number of}} sequential duplications from one of the Class A Mups. As all the <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> genes are almost identical to each other, researchers have concluded that these duplications occurred very recently in mouse evolution. Indeed, the repetitive structure of these central Mup genes means {{they are likely to be}} unstable and may vary in number among wild mice. The Class A Mups are more different from each other and are therefore likely to be more stable, older genes but what, if any, functional differences the classes have are unknown. The similarity between the genes makes the region difficult to study using current DNA sequencing technology. Consequently, the Mup gene cluster is one of the few parts of the mouse whole genome sequence with gaps remaining, and further genes may remain undiscovered.|$|E

40|$|The {{popularity}} of trucks {{in the class}} 2 category [...] that is, those with a 6, 000 to 10, 000 pounds (lbs) {{gross vehicle weight rating}} (GVWR) [...] has increased since the late 1970 s/early 1980 s. The purpose of this research is to identify and examine vehicles in the upper portion of the class 2 weight range (designated as vehicle <b>class</b> 2 <b>b)</b> and to assess their impact. Vehicles in <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> (8, 500 - 10, 000 lbs GVWR) include pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and large vans (i. e., not minivans). Oak Ridge National Laboratory researched each individual truck model to determine which models were <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks and arrived at four methodologies to derive sales volumes. Two methods [...] one for calendar year and one for model year sales [...] were recommended for producing believable and reliable results. The study indicates that 521, 000 <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks were sold in calendar year 1999 [...] 6. 4 % of sales of all trucks under 10, 000 lbs. Eighty-two percent of <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks sold in 1999 were pickups; one third of <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks sold in 1999 were diesel. There were 5. 8 million <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks on the road in 2000, which amounts to 7. 8 % of all trucks under 10, 000 lbs. Twenty-four percent of the <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> truck population is diesel. Estimates show that <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks account for 8 % of annual miles traveled by trucks under 10, 000 lbs and 9 % of fuel use. Data on <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks are scarce. As the Tier 2 standards, which apply to passenger vehicles in the 8, 500 - 10, 000 lb GVWR category, become effective, additional data on <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks may become available [...] not only emissions data, but data in all areas. At the moment, distinguishing <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks from <b>class</b> 2 trucks in general is a substantial task requiring data on an individual model level...|$|R

5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' <b>class</b> <b>B</b> shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
