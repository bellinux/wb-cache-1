40|$|Leaf area index (LAI), {{specific}} leaf area (SLA) {{and leaf}} {{dry matter content}} (LDMC) are plant/crop physiological variables {{which could be used}} to differentiate among and select maize cultivars suitable for specific environmental conditions, particularly in rain-fed agriculture. The leaf area index, SLA, LDMC and total dry matter (TDM) were estimated for the three rain-fed maize cultivars (Golden Crystal, Mamaba and Obatanpa) during the major and minor cropping seasons. The experimental design used was the completely randomized block design in four replicates, with maize cultivars as treatments. This study was undertaken to assess differences or similarities in the time course of LAI, SLA and LDMC as an assessment of the response of the three maize cultivars to rain-fed conditions during the major and minor cropping seasons in a coastal savannah agro-ecological environment. Additionally, the linear correlation analysis was used to assess the association between LAI and SLA, LAI and LDMC, SLA and LDMC, SLA and LDMC, TDM and LAI as well as between TDM and LDMC for the three rain-fed maize cultivars. Generally, Obatanpa and Mamaba maize cultivars produced comparatively higher LAI which peaked at about 1. 30 and 2. 00 on 84 DAE during the major and minor cropping seasons, respectively. The maize cultivars had mean peak SLA values of 1. 20 m^ 2 g^- 1 on 14 DAR and 1. 60 m^ 2 g^- 1 on 28 DAE during the major and minor cropping seasons, respectively. With regards to LCMD, all the maize cultivars had peak values on 28 DAE, with the value of Golden Crystal being 0. 70 g g^- 1 during the major season and 0. 65 g g^- 1 for Mamaba during the minor cropping season. During the major cropping season the linear regression between SLA and LDMC for Obatanpa (R = 0. 948) and for Mamaba (R = 0. 222) were positive but positive and poor for Golden Crystal (R = 0. 059). For the minor cropping season, the correlation between SLA and LDMC remained positive and fairly good for Obatanpa (R = 0. 702), Mamaba(R = 0. 861) and positive but poor for Golden Crystal (R = 0. 363). However the <b>combined</b> <b>cropping</b> seasons, R value was positive and good for Obatanpa (R = 0. 701) and Mamaba (R = 0. 861) while that for Golden Crystal was poor (R = 0. 363). Such a poor linear correlation between SLA and LDMC for Golden Crystal is an indication that the maize cultivar is poorly adapted to the rain-fed coastal savannah agro-ecological environment and, therefore, not suitable for the cropping environment. Additionally, the correlation between TDM and LAI was positive but poor in all the crop growing seasons, with R values ranging from 0. 423 for Obatanpa, 0. 524 for Mamaba and 0. 562 for Golden Crystal. Furthermore, R value was 0. 507 for the <b>combined</b> <b>cropping</b> seasons and all the maize cultivars.

40|$|Grain sorghum is {{the major}} dryland summer crop {{produced}} in the subtropical region of Australia. Production variability is great and the consequent uncertainty about likely production restricts marketing options and contributes to instability in grain price. Improved methods for predicting regional production would assist marketing decisions for farmers and grain traders. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether reliable regional grain sorghum production predictions could be generated by <b>combining</b> <b>crop</b> simulation and geographic information system technologies. We used historical shire production data to test the approach using hindcasting. Geographical data bases of landscape and soil attributes were used to define arable land boundaries and soil properties. Geographical data bases of daily rainfall and climate were overlaid and used to drive a spatial simulation of sorghum production for all shires in Queensland for the period 1977 - 1988. The results of the simulation were compared with production statistics at the shire and aggregate state levels. The spatial integrity of the prediction system was examined by comparing maps of predicted and reported shire production for specific years. There was a general tendency for the simulated yields per unit area to be greater and more variable (from year to year) than the historical shire production data. This probably reflected the fact that the simulation assumed perfect management and pest-free conditions. The relatively coarse spatial interpolation of rainfall would likely also contribute to this outcome. Linear regression relationships were developed between historical and simulated data at the shire scale to calibrate the simulated yields. Estimates of total production for each shire (in any year) were derived from the predicted yield per unit area, which was derived from the regression correction of the simulated yield, and the reported area planted. Excellent agreement between predicted and reported production occurred both at the individual shire and aggregate state (r = 0. 96) scales. This approach was compared with use of mean shire yield as the estimate of predicted yield per unit area to examine the contribution of the yield simulation procedure to production prediction. Significant improvement in production prediction was attributed to the yield simulation. The spatial distribution of shire production estimates was examined by categorising and mapping shire production predictions. Comparisons with reported production estimates showed the integrity of the spatial distribution was largely retained. Hence, we conclude that reliable shire and state sorghum production estimates can be generated by <b>combining</b> <b>crop</b> simulation and geographic information system technologies.
