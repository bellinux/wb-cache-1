5|$|As {{the player}} makes <b>choices</b> {{throughout}} the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, {{the outcome of}} entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) can be manipulated {{to a certain extent}} based on player <b>choices.</b> These <b>choices</b> are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardize the mission by forcing one of the guards to commit suicide. <b>Choices</b> also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.|$|E

40|$|This paper derives a {{trick to}} account for {{variation}} in <b>choice</b> set size in Random Regret Minimization (RRM) models. In many <b>choice</b> situations the <b>choice</b> set size varies across <b>choice</b> observations. As in RRM models regret level differences increase with increasing <b>choice</b> set size, not accounting for variation in <b>choice</b> set size results in RRM models to predict relatively deterministic <b>choice</b> behaviour in observations where the <b>choice</b> set is large and relatively random <b>choice</b> behaviour in observations where the <b>choice</b> set is small. Such variation in <b>choice</b> consistency across observations is behaviourally unrealistic and leads to inferior performance of RRM models {{in the context of}} data sets with varying <b>choice</b> set sizes. The proposed trick resolves this in an econometrically pragmatic and behaviourally meaningful way by rescaling the regret levels {{as a function of the}} <b>choice</b> set size. The trick can be applied in the estimation phase when the <b>choice</b> set size varies across <b>choice</b> observations as well as in the forecasting phase when forecasts are made over <b>choice</b> sets of varying sizes.
