5|$|The Front of the Stage is open'd, and the Band of 24 Violins, {{with the}} Harpsicals and Theorbo's which {{accompany}} the Voices, are plac'd between the Pit and the Stage. While the Overture is playing, the Curtain rises, and discovers a new Frontispiece, joyn'd {{to the great}} Pylasters, {{on each side of}} the Stage... Behind this is the Scene, which represents a thick <b>Cloudy</b> <b>Sky,</b> a very Rocky Coast, and a Tempestuous Sea in perpetual Agitation. This Tempest (suppos'd to be rais'd by Magick) has many dreadful Objects in it, as several Spirits in horrid shapes flying down amongst the Sailers, then rising and crossing in the Air. And when the Ship is sinking, the whole House is darken'd, and a shower of Fire falls upon 'em. This is accompanied with Lightning, and several Claps of Thunder, to the end of the Storm.|$|E
5|$|After {{making her}} way to New York, West Gate took on 6,700 tons of cargo that {{included}} locomotives, steel rails, and other materiel for the United States Army and departed in a convoy for France on 28 June. The ship soon developed engine trouble and {{dropped out of the}} convoy to head to St. John's, Newfoundland, for repairs. While headed to St. John's in moderate seas under a <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky,</b> West Gate was attacked by two German submarines at 19:15 on 3 July. One U-boat surfaced in front of the cargo ship, crossing to starboard. As West Gate quickly turned to port to evade the U-boat, a second U-boat surfaced one point to starboard. While West Gates radio operator sent out a preemptive SOS, her gunners opened fire on the two submarines. Though her gunners made hits on neither boat, both were bracketed with fire, quickly submerged, and apparently departed the scene. West Gate arrived at St. John's at 18:00 on 7 July without any further contact with enemy vessels.|$|E

25|$|Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 116 x 88.8cm (45 3/8 by 35 in), signed Metzinger (lower right). The work—consistent in style with other works by Metzinger created circa 1905-1906, such as Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat)—represents two nude women, one {{seen from the}} rear and the other from a more frontal position, in a lush, tropical, or subtropical setting. The landscape contains {{a wide variety of}} exotic geometrized elements (trees, bushes, flowers, a lake or river, a mountain range and a partly <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky).</b> Metzinger's use of color in Two Nudes is extremely Fauve; quasi-pure reds, greens, blues and violets, juxtaposed in groups as if randomly.|$|E
25|$|The {{background}} forms a semi-urban {{landscape that}} possesses both rural and semi-industrial components, consistent with Courbevoie of the 1910s (except {{perhaps for the}} rock-like outcrops), a village or town with delicate smokestacks or factory chimneys billowing smoke that blends into the <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky.</b> Evidence that factories were already located on the Seine (billowing smoke) {{can be seen in}} Gleizes' Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie of 1908. The statuesque nudes themselves are highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves, yet they are graceful, balletic and elegant. The source of light, rather than beaming down from one particular direction, appears to emanate from within the canvas itself, with an intensification {{in the vicinity of the}} bathers.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} {{shot on the}} streets of Los Angeles and in a studio soundstage. It begins with Frusciante {{standing}} alone on a pedestal wearing a red-and-white-striped collared shirt, brown khaki pants, brown shoes, and a purple, green and multicolored chullo, with white stitched wolves in the middle. He plays a 1966 Ocean Turquoise Fender Jaguar behind the backdrop of a desert and an inverted <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky.</b> His shadow is projected on the left and right of where he stands. Frusciante's then-girlfriend, Toni Oswald, selected his clothes that day. Frusciante remembers Van Sant's surprised, though favorable, reaction: [...] "when I got [...] Gus Van Sant was just looking at me and going 'God I'm so glad you wore that hat. I'm so glad you wore that shirt. Oh! Those pants are so great I'm so glad you wore those'". The video marks a significant shift in Frusciante's on-camera behavior; he no longer wished to jump around fervently as he had done in the band's prior music videos.|$|E

2500|$|Much of {{the winter}} {{variability}} in this region is due to clouds. [...] Since there is no sunlight, the thermal radiation emitted by the atmosphere is one of this region's main sources of energy in winter.

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} here is {{that the}} Jewish calendar was based not on astronomical calculation but on observation. It is possible to establish the phase of the moon on a particular day two thousand years ago but not whether it was obscured by clouds or haze. Including the possibility of a <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky</b> obscuring the moon, and assuming that the Jewish authorities would be aware that lunar months can only be either 29 or 30 days long (the time from one new moon to the next is 29.53 days), then the Friday requirement might also have been met, during Pontius Pilate's term of office, on 11 April AD27. [...] Another potential date arises if the Jewish authorities happened to add an irregular lunar leap month to compensate for a meteorologically delayed harvest season: this would yield one additional possibility during Pilate's time, which is Newton's favoured date of 23 April AD34. Colin Humphreys calculates but rejects these AD27 and AD34 dates on the basis that the former is much too early to be compatible with Luke 3:1-2, and spring AD34 is probably too late to be compatible with Paul's timeline.|$|E
2500|$|The Van Gogh Museum's Wheat Field with Crows {{was made}} in July 1890, in the last weeks of Van Gogh’s life, many have claimed it was his last work. [...] Others have claimed Tree Roots was his last painting. [...] Wheat Field with Crows, made on an {{elongated}} canvas, depicts a dramatic <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky</b> filled with crows over a wheat field. The wind-swept wheat field fills {{two thirds of the}} canvas. [...] An empty path pulls the audience into the painting. [...] Jules Michelet, one of Van Gogh's favorite authors, wrote of the crow: [...] "They interest themselves in everything, and observe everything. [...] The ancients, who lived far more completely than ourselves in and with nature, found it no small profit to follow, in a hundred obscure things where human experience as yet affords no light, the directions so prudent and sage a bird." [...] Of making the painting Van Gogh wrote {{that he did not have}} a hard time depicting the sadness and emptiness of the painting, which was powerfully offset by the restorative nature of the countryside. [...] Erickson, author of Eternity's Gate: The Spiritual Vision of Vincent van Gogh, cautious of attributing stylistic changes in his work to mental illness, finds the painting expresses both the sorrow and the sense of his life coming to an end. [...] The crows, used by Van Gogh as symbol of death and rebirth or resurrection, visually draw the spectator into the painting. [...] The road, in contrasting colors of red and green, is thought to be a metaphor for a sermon he gave based on Bunyan's [...] "Pilgrim's Progress" [...] where the pilgrim is sorrowful that the road is so long, yet rejoicing because the Eternal City waits at the journey's end.|$|E
