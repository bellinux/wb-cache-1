Armed with her special katana, Saya embarks on a journey with her family, allies, and her chevalier Haji, to rid the world of the <b>Chiropteran</b> threat and recover her identity.

Set {{during the year}} between episodes 32 and 33, after Riku's death, the game alternates between an [...] "Active Demo" [...] section where the player can make decisions that change the story line, and full action sequences where the player, as Saya, fights with her sword to collect <b>chiropteran</b> crystals.|$|E
5000|$|The promotional {{video for}} [...] "Aozora no Namida" [...] was {{directed}} by AT, and, like her previous two, was filmed at an unknown location. The PV starts off with the main character of Blood+, Saya Otonashi, preparing to fight a <b>Chiropteran.</b> The scene suddenly changes to Hitomi waking up on a staircase, looking around, and then walking down the staircase. The scene changes again to Saya killing the <b>Chiropteran,</b> the scene also constantly switching from Hitomi to this scene as Hitomi continues to [...] "search" [...] around the place. As the PV progresses, Hitomi stumbles upon Saya fighting another <b>Chiropteran,</b> with Saya losing control of her sword. Also, other scenes of Hitomi can be seen; Hitomi sitting on a bunch of rocks with steam around her, and Hitomi singing in a subway-like setting (this is also where {{the fight against the}} second <b>Chiropteran</b> takes place). Hitomi grabs the sword and kills the <b>Chiropteran</b> causing Saya to disappear with a smile. The end of the PV features Hitomi walking out onto a cliff to view a city being ravaged by more Chiroptera, her eyes glowing red.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chiropterans</b> in {{education}} of zoology at {{elementary and high}} schools" This rigorous thesis {{can be considered as}} an extension and completion of the graduation thesis with the same name (finished by author on Charles University in April 2008), which processes the topic of <b>Chiropterans</b> and focuses on its use {{in education}} of biology at elementary and high schools. The main goal of the rigorous thesis is to verify usage of the topic at school praxis. The thesis consists of two main parts. Theoretical part provides basic inforrnation about <b>Chiropterans,</b> their characteristic signs, habits and way of life. Attention is focused especially on species of bats living in Czech Republic. The chapter deals with the factors threatening <b>Chiropterans</b> and problems of their protection in Czech Republic are addressed as well. Special chapter relate to the history of Czech Chiropterology. Practical part of this work processes excursions to winter roosting sites of the bats and also proposes summer excursions to their hunting-grounds with the use of electronic device to monitor active bats. The same chapter deals with didactic and methodic too. Special attention is focused on verification of practical usage of the topic at schools.

Major reason for choosing this topic is lack of zoological excursions at elementary and high schools. It is because zoological excursions are considered to be complicated to organize and difficult to prepare. Therefore students don't have a possibility to observe animals in their nature sites. Excursions to winter roosting sites provide good opportunity to change this situation. Another reason for choosing {{the topic of}} this thesis is the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{identify}} potential zoonotic reservoirs of pathogenic leptospires in the Peruvian Amazon basin, wild mammals {{were trapped}} from July 1997 to December 1998 {{near the city}} of Iquitos. After extraction of nucleic acids from animal kidneys, DNA of pathogenic leptospires was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays using one of two primer sets, one amplifying a region of the 23 S rRNA gene, and the other amplifying a gene fragment specific for Leptospira spp (G 1 /G 2 primers). Overall, 29 % (40 of 136) of the mammals tested showed evidence of renal infection by Leptospira spp., including 20 % (13 of 64) of the rodents, 39 % (20 of 51) of the marsupials, and 35 % (7 of 20) of the <b>chiropterans</b> (bats). Marsupials and <b>chiropterans</b> were implicated as more significant reservoir hosts of leptospires pathogenic to humans than previously recognized...|$|R

50|$|Several bat {{species are}} known from this locality, {{including}} the similarly large Witwatia species, which are directly contemporary to Aegyptonycteris, {{suggesting that this}} environment supported several large sized <b>chiropteran</b> species.

50|$|At {{the time}} he arrived in the region, only 21 species of mammals were {{considered}} native to Somalia. Following his explorations, that number grew to 87.

50|$|The {{fossil record}} of bats extends {{back at least}} to the early Eocene, and <b>chiropteran</b> fossils are known from all continents except Antarctica. Icaronycteris, Archaeonycteris, Hassianycetris, and Palaeochiropteryx, unlike most other fossil bats, have not been {{referred}} to any extant family or superfamily. These Eocene taxa are known from exceptionally well-preserved fossils, and they have long formed a basis for reconstructing the early evolutionary history of Chiroptera.|$|E
50|$|Aegyptonycteris {{is notable}} both its large size, {{comparable}} to the larger modern bat species, as well due to its omnivorous diet, {{as opposed to the}} mostly insectivorous diets of other Eocene bats (and the majority of modern species). This makes it a remarkable example of early <b>chiropteran</b> speciation, having not only attained a rather large size but also specialised towards a drastically different ecological niche from its contemporaries.|$|E

One of them, David, begins to brief Saya on another mission, while the other, Louis, discovers that the man Saya has just killed was probably not a <b>chiropteran.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some <b>Chiropterans</b> consume nectar instead, {{for which}} they have {{acquired}} specialized adaptations. These bats possess long muzzles and long, extensible tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. However, because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than {{any other type of}} bat.|$|R
