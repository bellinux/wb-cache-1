2500|$|The National Labor Relations Act {{provides}} {{protection to}} employees {{who wish to}} join or form a union and those who engage in union activity. The act also protects employees who engage in a [...] "concerted activity." [...] Most employers set forth their workplace rules and policies in an employee handbook. A <b>common</b> <b>provision</b> in those handbooks is a statement that employment with the employer is [...] "at-will." [...] In 2012, the National Labor Relations Board, the federal administrative agency responsible for enforcing the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), instituted two cases attacking at-will employment disclaimers in employee handbooks. The NLRB challenged broadly worded disclaimers, alleging that the statements improperly suggested that employees could not act concertedly to attempt to change the at-will nature of their employment, and thereby interfered with employees’ protected rights under the NLRA.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, we have," [...] I returned; and I tried, once more, as I {{have tried}} so often with Americans, {{to explain how}} the heavenly need of giving the self {{continues}} with us, but on terms that do not harrow the conscience of the giver, as self-sacrifice always must here, at its purest and noblest. I sought to make her conceive of our nation as a family, where every one was secured against want by the <b>common</b> <b>provision,</b> and against the degrading and depraving inequality which comes from want. The [...] "dead-level of equality" [...] is what the Americans call the condition in which all would be as the angels of God, and they blasphemously deny that He ever meant His creatures to be alike happy, because some, through a long succession of unfair advantages, have inherited more brain or brawn or beauty than others. I found that this gross and impious notion of God darkened even the clear intelligence of a woman like Mrs. Strange; and, indeed, it prevails here so commonly that {{it is one of the}} first things advanced as an argument against the Altrurianization of America.|$|E
60|$|There are {{two lines}} of {{reasoning}} that go to establish a longer duration for marriage. The first of these rests upon the general necessity for a home and for individual attention {{in the case of}} children. Children are the results of a choice between individuals; they grow well, as a rule, only in relation to sympathetic and kindred individualities, and no wholesale character-ignoring method of dealing with them has ever had a shadow {{of the success of the}} individualised home. Neither Plato nor Socrates, who repudiated the home, seems ever to have had to do with anything younger than a young man. Procreation is only the beginning of parentage, and even where the mother is not the direct nurse and teacher of her child, even where she delegates these duties, her supervision is, in the common case, essential to its welfare. Moreover, though the Utopian State will pay the mother, and the mother only, for the being and welfare of her legitimate children, there will be a clear advantage in fostering the natural disposition of the father to associate his child's welfare with his individual egotism, and to dispense some of his energies and earnings in supplementing the <b>common</b> <b>provision</b> of the State. It is an absurd disregard of a natural economy to leave the innate philoprogenitiveness of either sex uncultivated. Unless the parents continue in close relationship, if each is passing through a series of marriages, the dangers of a conflict of rights, and of the frittering away of emotions, become very grave. The family will lose homogeneity, and its individuals will have for the mother varied and perhaps incompatible emotional associations. The balance of social advantage is certainly on the side of much more permanent unions, on the side of an arrangement that, subject to ample provisions for a formal divorce without disgrace in cases of incompatibility, would bind, or at least enforce ideals that would tend to bind, a man and woman together for the whole term of her maternal activity, until, that is, the last born of her children was no longer in need of her help.|$|E

Supermajority requirements for tax increases have been criticized as [...] "deeply flawed" [...] by a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report, since such requirements make it difficult to close tax loopholes, empower a minority of legislators, make it difficult to fund transportation infrastructure, and may encourage pork-barrel spending as a trade-off to ensure passage of a tax increase (see logrolling).|$|E

40|$|Sick pay is a <b>common</b> <b>provision</b> in most labor contracts. This paper employs an {{experimental}} gift-exchange environment to explore two related questions using both managers and undergraduates as subjects. First, do workers reciprocate sick pay {{in the same}} way as they reciprocate wage payments? Second, do firms benefit from offering sick pay? Firms may benefit in two different ways: directly, from workers reciprocating higher sick pay with higher efforts; and indirectly, from self-selection of reciprocal workers into contracts with higher sick pay. Our main finding is that the direct effect is rather weak in terms of effort and negative in terms of profits. However, when there is competition among firms for workers, sick pay can become an important advantage. Consequently, competition leads to a higher provision of sick pay relative to a monopsonistic labor market. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Building and Construction Law Journal [© Thomson Reuters on behalf of Lawbook Co. ]. Introduced as a measure to improve security of payment, the requirement that a head contractor provide proof that it has paid its subcontractors as a condition precedent to its own entitlement to be paid by the principal has for some time been a <b>common</b> <b>provision</b> in Australian standard form construction contracts. Recognising that allegations of some head contractors swearing false statutory declarations in relation to their contractual proof of payment obligations have been longstanding, the New South Wales Parliament has recently enacted a statutory requirement for head contractors to provide proof of payment in the building and construction industry. By examining the statutory provisions, and analysing their likely implications, this article investigates whether the proof of payment requirements are likely to have more “bite” than their contractual cousins and therefore be more effective at improving security of payment and reducing insolvencies in the building and construction industry...|$|E
40|$|Sick-pay is a <b>common</b> <b>provision</b> {{in labor}} contracts. It insures workers against a sudden {{loss of income}} due to {{unexpected}} absences and helps them smooth consumption. Therefore, many governments find sick-pay socially desirable and choose to mandate its provision. But sick-pay {{is not without its}} problems. Not only it suffers from moral hazard but more importantly it is subject to a potentially serious adverse selection problem (higher sick-pay attracts sicker workers). In this paper we report results of an experiment which inquires to the extend and the severity of the adverse selection when sick-pay is voluntary versus when it is mandatory. Theoretically, mandating sick-pay may be effective in diminishing adverse selection. However, our data provide clean evidence that counteracting effects are more salient. Mandatory sick pay exacerbates moral hazard problems by changing fairness perceptions and, as a consequence, increases sick pay provision far above the mandatory levels. sick pay; sick leave; experiment; gift exchange. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{builds a}} {{tractable}} {{model of a}} patent pool, an agreement among patent owners to license a set of their patents to one another or to third parties. It first provides a necessary and suñcient condition for a patent pool to enhance welfare. It shows that requiring pool members {{to be able to}} independently license patents matters if and only if the pool is otherwise welfare reducing, a property that allows the antitrust authorities to use this requirement to screen out unattractive pools. The paper then undertakes a number of extensions. It evaluates the external test' according to which patents with substitutes should not be included in a pool; analyzes the welfare implications of the reduction in the members' incentives to invent around or challenge the validity of each other's patents; looks at the rationale for the (<b>common)</b> <b>provision</b> of automatic assignment of future related patents to the pool; and, last, studies the intellectual property owners' incentives to form a pool or to cross-license when they themselves are users of the patents in the pool. ...|$|E
