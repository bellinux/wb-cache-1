5|$|Like {{many other}} light {{anti-tank}} guns, the M3 was {{widely used in}} the infantry support role and as an anti-personnel weapon, firing high-explosive and <b>canister</b> rounds.|$|E
5|$|The CS spray used {{by police}} forces {{is in the}} form of a {{hand-held}} aerosol <b>canister</b> containing a 5% solution of CS dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone and propelled by pressurized nitrogen. The CS spray used by UK police is generally more concentrated than that used by American police forces (5% vs 1%). The liquid stream is directed where the user points the <b>canister,</b> being accurate up to 4 metres. They are also trained in helping the incapacitated person recover once successfully restrained.|$|E
5|$|The Dnepr rocket {{assigned}} to launch CryoSat-2 {{arrived at the}} Baikonur Cosmodrome by train on 29 December 2009. On 12 January 2010, the first two stages of the rocket were loaded into the launch <b>canister,</b> and the <b>canister</b> was prepared for transportation to the launch site. On 14 January, it was rolled out to Site 109/95, where it was installed into its silo. The next day saw the third stage transported to the silo, and installed atop the rocket.|$|E
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{produced}} 55 <b>canistered</b> waste forms containing simulated {{waste glass}} {{during the four}} Waste Qualification campaigns of the DWPF Startup Test Program. Testing of the gas within the free volume of these <b>canisters</b> for dew point, internal gas pressure, and chemical composition was performed {{as part of a}} continuing effort to demonstrate compliance with the Waste Acceptance Product Specifications. Results are presented for six glass-filled <b>canisters.</b> The dew points within the <b>canisters</b> met the acceptance criterion of < 20 {degrees}C for all six <b>canisters.</b> Factors influencing the magnitude of the dew point are presented. The chemical composition of the free volume gas was indistinguishable from air for all six <b>canisters.</b> Hence, no foreign materials were present in the gas phase of these <b>canisters.</b> The internal gas pressures within the sealed <b>canisters</b> were < 1 atm at 25 {degrees}C for all six <b>canisters</b> which readily met the acceptance criterion of an internal gas pressure of less than 1. 5 atm at 25 {degrees}C. These results provided the evidence required to demonstrate compliance with the Waste Acceptance Product Specifications...|$|R
25|$|In Sweden in 1984, {{carbonic}} acid supplier Sydbrand, primarily a supplier of fire equipment, was sued successfully by SodaStream for trademark infringement for refilling SodaStream-labelled CO2 <b>canisters.</b> In 2006, SodaStream lost {{a suit against}} the resale of its Alco2jet brand <b>canisters</b> on eBay {{on the grounds that}} the <b>canisters</b> were only lent, not sold.|$|R
50|$|SCE {{decided on}} Holtec International {{to design the}} dry storage <b>canisters.</b> The <b>canisters</b> will be five-eighths of an inch thick {{compared}} to most <b>canisters</b> in the U.S. being half of an inch thick. These steel-lined concrete monoliths {{right next to the}} Pacific Ocean exceed California’s earthquake requirements and Edison says they are designed to withstand fire and tsunamis.|$|R
5|$|The M3 {{utilized}} fixed ammunition. Projectiles were {{fitted with}} a 37x223R cartridge case, designated Cartridge Case M16. Available projectiles included armor-piercing, high-explosive and <b>canister.</b>|$|E
5|$|The second {{explosive}} <b>canister,</b> {{lying on}} the bottom, exploded close to the Austrian freighter Wien, resulting in her sinking.|$|E
5|$|Traveling {{down the}} rows of Austrian battleships, the two men {{encountered}} Viribus Unitis at around 4:40am. Rossetti placed one <b>canister</b> of TNT on the hull of the battleship, timed to explode at 6:30am. He then flooded the second <b>canister,</b> sinking it on the harbor floor close to the ship. This second <b>canister</b> exploded close to the Austrian freighter Wien, resulting in her sinking. The men had no breathing sets, and therefore had to keep their heads above water. They were discovered and taken prisoner just after placing the explosives under the battleship's hull. The two-man team were captured and taken aboard Viribus Unitis, where they informed the new captain of the battleship {{what they had done}} but did not reveal the exact position of the explosives. Admiral Vuković then arranged for the two prisoners to be taken safely to the sister ship , and ordered the evacuation of the ship. The explosion did not happen at 6:30 as predicted and Vuković returned to the ship with many sailors (believing mistakenly that the Italians had lied). He therefore remained on his ship and went down with her and 300–400 of her crew when the mines exploded shortly afterwards at 6:44. Following the explosion, the battleship sank in 15 minutes.|$|E
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{produced}} {{a total of}} fifty-five <b>canistered</b> wasteforms during four campaigns for the Waste Qualification Program to Radioactive Operations. These <b>canistered</b> wasteforms contained borosilicate glasses, which were non-radioactive simulants of the predicted DWPF radioactive glass compositions. Testing of these <b>canisters</b> has been performed {{as part of a}} continuing effort to demonstrate compliance with the Waste Acceptance Product Specifications...|$|R
2500|$|Butane is {{also used}} as lighter fuel for a common lighter or butane torch and is sold bottled as a fuel for cooking, {{barbecues}} and camping stoves. Butane <b>canisters</b> are almost exclusively manufactured in South Korea with the only exception being one manufacturer in Houston, Texas. Butane <b>canisters</b> manufactured in South Korea contain butane from Saudi Arabia, while the American manufacturer fills <b>canisters</b> with domestic butane.|$|R
50|$|The TLAM-D {{contains}} 166 sub-munitions in 24 canisters: 22 <b>canisters</b> {{of seven}} each, and two <b>canisters</b> of six each {{to conform to}} the dimensions of the airframe. The sub-munitions are the same type of Combined Effects Munition bomblet used in large quantities by the U.S. Air Force with the CBU-87 Combined Effects Munition. The sub-munitions <b>canisters</b> are dispensed two at a time, one per side. The missile can perform up to five separate target segments which enables it to attack multiple targets. However, in order to achieve a sufficient density of coverage typically all 24 <b>canisters</b> are dispensed sequentially from back to front.|$|R
5|$|With La Haye Sainte captured, Ney {{then moved}} skirmishers and horse {{artillery}} up towards Wellington's centre. French artillery began to pulverise the infantry squares at short range with <b>canister.</b> The 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses {{that they had}} to combine to form a viable square.|$|E
5|$|During the Pakistan and Canada warm-up {{match at}} Sir Frank Worrell Memorial Ground, the sight screen was knocked {{down and the}} game was delayed by over 70 minutes and reduced to 48 overs. Additionally, a tear gas <b>canister</b> {{exploded}} at the Trinidad hotel where the Pakistan, South Africa, Canada and Ireland teams were staying. The hotel had to be evacuated but no injuries were reported.|$|E
5|$|Exploration of {{the docks}} reveals a strange <b>canister</b> filled with {{swirling}} liquid. Thinking the <b>canister</b> contains healing or energizing properties, the Shaper breaks the seal and absorbs the contents. Instead the contents absorb into the Shaper's body, strengthening and changing it. The changes become visibly apparent, the player character's skin smoothens and glows slightly. The canisters also affect the user's mental state, causing a more violent and arrogant temperament. Serviles {{remain on the}} island, having been abandoned when the island was Barred. They are intelligent creations of Shapers, designed to serve them without question or hesitation. These Serviles have had no contact with Shapers for two centuries, and have separated into three groups with differing philosophies regarding their creators. The Obeyers are still faithful to the Shapers, the Awakened believe {{that they should be}} treated as equals. The Takers have rejected Shapers completely and view the sect as oppressors to be fought.|$|E
25|$|The M90 {{series of}} shells were ballistically matched {{to make it}} easier to use {{different}} types without losing accuracy. Ammunition was shipped in 25-round metal <b>canisters.</b> There were 6 metal <b>canisters</b> per wooden crate (150 rounds).|$|R
40|$|Drift-emplaced waste <b>canisters</b> {{are under}} {{consideration}} for the long-term storage of high-level spent fuel in the proposed underground repository at Yucca Mountain. These <b>canisters</b> will be placed on pedestals above {{the floor of the}} drifts and exchange heat with the walls of the drift and with air circulating through the repository. To assess the requirements of the repository ventilation system, values of the dimensionless convective heat transfer coefficient and the pressure drop across individual <b>canisters</b> were measured in a experimental model of a drift. The results were curvefitted as functions of the spacing between the <b>canisters</b> and the Reynolds number of the flow. Both natural and forced convection effects were investigated...|$|R
40|$|Selected fuel {{elements}} stored in both ``good fuel`` and ``bad fuel`` <b>canisters</b> in K East Basin were extracted and visually examined full length for damage. Lower end {{damage in the}} ``bad fuel`` <b>canisters</b> {{was found to be}} more severe than expected based on top end appearances. Lower end damage for the ``good fuel`` <b>canisters,</b> however, was less than expected based on top end observations. Since about half of the fuel in K East Basin is contained in ``good fuel`` <b>canisters</b> based on top end assessments, the fraction of fuel projected to be intact with respect to IPS processing considerations remains at 50 % based on these examination results...|$|R
5|$|In Israel, CS gas was {{reported}} to be the cause of death of Jawaher Abu Rahmah on 31 December 2010; other reports suggest that he was killed by the impact of a high-velocity CS gas <b>canister</b> to the chest. In Egypt, CS gas {{was reported}} to be the cause of death of several protesters in Mohamed Mahmoud Street near Tahrir square during the November 2011 protests.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} {{ammunition}} were available, each for different uses: round shot (cannonballs) against ship hulls, chain shot against masts and rigging, and <b>canister</b> shot (wooden cylinders filled with metal balls or fragments), {{which had a}} devastating effect on tightly packed groups of men. For boarding actions Kronan was equipped with 130 muskets and 80 matchlock or flintlock pistols. For close combat there were 250 pikes, 200 boarding axes and 180 swords. During the excavations, large-caliber firearms were found – hakebössor, similar to blunderbusses; they were equipped with a small catch underneath the barrel which allowed them to be hooked over a railing {{to allow it to}} absorb the recoil of the charges. One hakebössa was still loaded with a small <b>canister</b> containing 20 lead balls that would have been used to clear enemy decks before boarding.|$|E
5|$|During the retreat, Montcalm, still mounted, {{was struck}} by either <b>canister</b> shot from the British {{artillery}} or repeated musket fire, suffering injuries to the lower abdomen and thigh. He {{was able to make}} it back into the city, but his wounds were mortal and he died early the next morning. He was buried in a shell crater left in the floor of the Ursuline chapel by a British shell. The battle resulted in similar numbers of casualties {{on both sides of the}} field; the French had 644 men killed or injured, while the British were left with 658 killed or wounded.|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitivity}} {{analysis was conducted}} to identify and evaluate potential destructive interactions between the materials in US Department of Energy (USDOE) spent nuclear fuels (SNFs) and their storage/disposal <b>canisters.</b> The technical assessment {{was based on the}} thermodynamic properties as well as the chemical and physical characteristics of the materials expected inside the <b>canisters.</b> No chemical reactions were disclosed that could feasibly corrode stainless steel <b>canisters</b> to the point of failure. However, the possibility of embrittlement (loss of ductility) of the stainless steel through contact with liquid metal fission products or hydrogen inside the <b>canisters</b> cannot be dismissed. Higher-than-currently-permitted internal gas pressures must also be considered. These results, based on the assessment of two representative 90 -year-cooled fuels that are stored at 200 °C in stainless steel <b>canisters</b> with internal blankets of helium, may be applied to most of the fuels in the USDOE's SNF inventory...|$|R
40|$|Onsite {{storage of}} <b>canisters</b> of {{solidified}} high-level waste {{generated by the}} commercial fuel reprocessing plants (FRP) may be required prior to shipping these <b>canisters</b> to a Federal repository. The most likely storage concept is to hold the waste-filled <b>canisters</b> in water storage basins. In the Retrievable Surface Storage Facility conceptual design studies, air-cooled and water-cooled storage of solidified high-level wastes has been considered. The studies of water-cooled storage included design considerations, {{as part of the}} conceptual design of the <b>canisters</b> and water storage basins, that would apply also to the conceptual design of similar facilities at an FRP. These similar considerations include: types of corrosion likely to develop on <b>canisters</b> stored in water, conditions that promote stress corrosion cracking (SCC), prevention of SCC, routine basin water cleanup, cleanup of a grossly contaminated water basin, effluent discharge discussions, storage basin integrity, and designing for decommissioning.

50|$|Due to {{conflicts}} with black bears, in 2015 the Forest Service implemented {{a requirement for}} all overnight campers to carry bear-resistant <b>canisters.</b> <b>Canisters</b> are required year-round in the Wilderness Area and south {{of it to the}} Blue Ridge Parkway.|$|R
5|$|Henry's men, {{the entire}} left wing, descended a bluff into {{the midst of}} several hundred Sauk and Fox warriors, and a desperate bayonet and musket battle followed. Women and {{children}} fled the fight into the river, where many drowned immediately. The battle continued for 30 minutes before Atkinson came up with Dodge's center element, cutting off escape {{for many of the}} remaining Native warriors. Some warriors managed to escape the fight to a willow island, which was being peppered with <b>canister</b> shot and gunfire by Warrior.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a <b>canister</b> containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her {{white blood cell count}} halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E
5|$|On an {{examining}} table, {{one of the}} kidnappers, Eric Swan (James Marsters), strips Taylor, harshly washes {{her with}} a course brush, and photographs her. The picture is sent to Watts, who is seen looking at it while supervising the crime scene. Black is also at the scene, and experiences a vision of Operation Desert Storm. Evidence is found of military-style tyre and boot tracks; these lead the FBI to an address where they find the second kidnapper murdered—Black and Watts clash over whether the Group or Swan are responsible. Back in the examination room, Swan exposes Taylor to a substance contained in a <b>canister.</b>|$|E
50|$|The getaway bridge, {{which was}} capable of holding 12 <b>canisters,</b> made its maiden flight on STS-61-C. The {{aluminum}} bridge fit across the payload bay of the orbiter and offered a convenient and economic way of flying several GAS <b>canisters.</b>|$|R
25|$|Testing {{showed that}} the two Gnome engines gave {{insufficient}} power, with the aircraft being unable to climb above 8,000ft (2,438m) carrying the required three <b>canisters</b> of 24 1lb (.5kg) Ranken darts. The weapon load was therefore reduced to two <b>canisters.</b>|$|R
40|$|Over 250 fuel {{assemblies}} {{stored in}} sealed <b>canisters</b> in the K West Basin were extracted and visually examined for damage. Substantial damage was expected based on high cesium levels previously measured in water samples taken from these <b>canisters.</b> About 11 % {{of the inner}} elements and 45 % of the outer elements {{were found to be}} failed in these examinations. <b>Canisters</b> that had cesium levels of I curie or more generally had multiple instances of major fuel damage...|$|R
5|$|The TDRS-1 {{program was}} overall less successful, with the {{satellite}} suffering several computer failures and an overall loss of telemetry for several hours. In all, the orbiter {{was able to}} use the satellite for 65 of the planned 89 orbits, and could make successful use of the connection on about forty. The Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System equipment functioned as planned, processing several hundred times more material than would have been possible on Earth, and the Asahi Shimbun crystal experiment, flown for the second time, was able to produce snow crystals after the <b>canister</b> was redesigned.|$|E
5|$|The {{incendiary}} liquids of {{the ancient}} and medieval periods were also developed, and have their modern equivalents. World War I saw {{the development of the}} flamethrower, a modern version of the Byzantine siphons, which used gas under pressure to squirt a mixture of inflammable oil and petrol, ignited by a burning taper. Similarly, the carcass projectile found new use in the Livens Projector, a primitive mortar that could throw a large <b>canister</b> of inflammable liquid (it was soon used for poison gas instead).|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} {{ammunition}} {{could be used}} for different purposes: plain spherical shot of stone or iron smashed hulls, spiked bar shot and shot linked with chains would tear sails or damage rigging, and <b>canister</b> shot packed with sharp flints produced a devastating shotgun effect. Trials made with replicas of culverins and port pieces showed that they could penetrate wood the same thickness of the Mary Rose's hull planking, indicating a stand-off range of at least 90m (295ft). The port pieces proved particularly efficient at smashing large holes in wood when firing stone shot and were a devastating anti-personnel weapon when loaded with flakes or pebbles.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} (Volume 1) is {{the preliminary}} design specification for the <b>canisters</b> to be used during the handling, storage, transportation, and repository disposal of Department of Energy (DOE) spent nuclear fuel (SNF). This document contains no procurement information, such {{as the number of}} <b>canisters</b> to be fabricated, explicit timeframes for deliverables, etc. A companion document (Volume 2) provides background information and design philosophy in order to help engineers better understand the established design requirements for these DOE SNF <b>canisters...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{objective}} of Rip-Off {{is to prevent}} computer-controlled enemies from stealing eight <b>canisters</b> set {{in the center of}} the screen. One or two players control tank-like vehicles while game-controlled [...] "pirate" [...] tanks rush onto the field and attempt to drag the <b>canisters</b> off the edge of the screen. Enemies can be defeated by shooting or colliding with them. The game speed and difficulty increase with each successive wave until all the <b>canisters</b> have been taken ("ripped off").|$|R
40|$|Activated {{charcoal}} <b>canisters</b> {{have been}} used successfully for the past 20 years in government and private industry radon measurement programs. Both the open face and diffusion barrier charcoal <b>canisters</b> were evaluated and were listed by EPA after they passed the EPA radon proficiency testing. Today, charcoal <b>canisters</b> are used by many professional testers listed by both NEHA and NRSB. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to set aside the myth and the misleading information that charcoal <b>canisters</b> are not as accurate as other radon measuring devices. Part of the blame falls within EPA which initially evaluated its open face <b>canisters</b> in limited and selective tests under extreme conditions. That myth was perpetuated for many years, even while EPA developed and evaluated a diffusion barrier charcoal adsorber that showed excellent results in both laboratory and field environments where the radon concentration was varied by more than 10 to 1 and at humidity ranging from 20 % to 85 %. Althoueh, EPA published the standard operating procedures for radon measurement using diffusion barrier charcoal <b>canisters</b> (EPA 520 / 5 - 90 - 032, November 1990).
