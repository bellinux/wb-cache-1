40|$|Rail {{terminals}} in port {{container terminals}} {{play an important}} role for transshipping <b>containers</b> between <b>rail</b> <b>wagons</b> and port <b>container</b> terminals. This paper addresses a case study for designing a new rail terminal which is planned to be constructed in a port container terminal. A design process including an analytical calculation and a simulation study was proposed. The analytical approach was used to estimate the facility size and the simulation was used to evaluate proposed design alternatives in more detail. Design parameters were the number of transshipment lanes, the number of cranes, and the traffic flows inside the rail terminal. ...|$|R
30|$|Today {{two general}} types of rolling stock {{are used for}} Swiss Split: {{standard}} flat wagons with wooden floors and conventional <b>container</b> <b>wagons.</b> Both types include two and four axle versions. The big difference between these vehicle types is that <b>container</b> <b>wagons</b> have no floor. This means loading and unloading equipment (e.g., forklifts) is unable to operate on these <b>container</b> <b>wagons.</b> Thus, additional equipment such as moveable ramps is required to load/unload the containers. Therefore a moveable ramp replaces the missing floor of the <b>container</b> <b>wagons.</b>|$|R

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} when replacing conventional flat <b>wagons</b> with standard <b>container</b> <b>wagons</b> is that <b>container</b> <b>wagons</b> (width: 2438  mm; height: 1155  mm) are narrower and lower than flat wagons (width: 2650  mm; height: 1230 to 1260  mm). Since the new wagons had to be designed to meet customers’ needs, the authors visited 18 Swiss Split customer sidings in Switzerland to measure the ramp height and vertical distance on site. They also studied operations and discussed the wagon requirements with company logistic managers.|$|R

30|$|SBB Cargo has {{developed}} a new business model for the Swiss Split service that integrates {{all parts of the}} process chain into a single product. This means that the entire distribution process from the hinterland terminal to the end customer including the return of the empty container to a depot is optimized. In the new model terminal operations, container movements and <b>container</b> <b>wagons</b> are dispatched from a single source. This will improve efficiency by, for example, increasing the number of round trips per week for <b>container</b> <b>wagons</b> used in Swiss Split from one to two or three a week in future.|$|R
