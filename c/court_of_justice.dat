5|$|On 11 November 2009, Wiens {{was found}} guilty of the murder of El-Sherbini and the {{attempted}} murder of Okaz, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Judge Birgit Wiegand stated that the court had also found that Wiens's deeds constituted a heinous crime, because they were committed in front of a child, against two people, in a court of law, and fulfilled the murder criterion of treacherousness, such as hatred against foreigners. It meant that Wiens received the maximum sentence for this crime. Wiens appealed the conviction; however, the appeal was rejected by the Federal <b>Court</b> <b>of</b> <b>Justice.</b> In a decision published on 18 June 2010, the fifth criminal division of the <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>justice</b> in Leipzig stated that the appeal on points of law was unfounded and confirmed the verdict and sentence of the regional court as final matter of criminal law.|$|E
