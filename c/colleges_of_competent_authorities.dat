Only 20 % had specific provisions for ships regarding quarantine, while a smaller proportion of new Member States (MS) have specific legislation in comparison with old MS (p = 0. 01).

About 30. 5 % <b>of</b> the <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> declared that they require submission of MDH by all arriving ships, but 28. 8 % only from affected areas, and 11. 9 % never require MDH.

40|$|The European Union hosts {{approximately}} 8500 {{industrial sites}} that are considered major hazards due to the potential accident risk associated {{with the presence of}} dangerous substances as defined by the Seveso II Directive. Approximately, half of these sites are classified as so-called lower tier sites because the quantity of the dangerous substances exceeds the lower threshold quantity stipulated in the Directive. Theoretically, the Seveso II Directive imposes a lower regulatory burden on lower tier sites than upper tier sites, whose quantity of dangerous substances exceed the higher threshold quantity given in the Directive. This lower burden is manifested particularly in Article 7, designed to apply exclusively to lower tier sites. In 2008 - 2009, on behalf of the Committee <b>of</b> Seveso <b>Competent</b> <b>Authorities</b> (CCA), the regulatory committee established by the Directive, the European Commission¿s Joint Research Centre (JRC) undertook a study of Seveso implementation in lower tier sites, through administration of a survey <b>of</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> and subsequently co-organization of a workshop on the topic with DG-Environment and the Czech Republic.
