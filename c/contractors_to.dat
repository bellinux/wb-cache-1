5|$|In mid-2016, Narayan's {{former home}} in Mysore was {{converted}} to a museum in his honor. The original structure was built in 1952. The house and surrounding land was acquired by real estate <b>contractors</b> <b>to</b> raze down and build an apartment complex in its stead but citizens groups and the Mysore City Corporation stepped in to repurchase the building and land and then restore it, subsequently converting it to a museum.|$|E
5|$|The Manhattan District {{accepted}} that {{wages and salaries}} had to be high enough to allow <b>contractors</b> <b>to</b> hire and retain good workers. It generally allowed wages and salaries to be paid by contractors as they saw fit, subject to limits imposed by wartime national wage and price controls intended to limit inflation.

5|$|The railway was {{constructed}} by the South Eastern Railway in the early 1850s across the difficult terrain of the High Weald. Supervision of {{the building of the}} line was lax, enabling <b>contractors</b> <b>to</b> skimp on the lining of the tunnels. These deficiencies showed up after the railway had opened. Rectifications led to a restricted loading gauge along the line, requiring the use of dedicated rolling stock.|$|E
5|$|The {{society was}} {{successful}} in raising the necessary funds by 1845. By April 4, 1845, bids were called for <b>contractors</b> <b>to</b> build the new school and library facility, and the bids were to be submitted to the society by May 24. On that date, the land was deeded for the new school. Construction commenced that year, and the building and its grounds cost approximately $8,000 to complete.|$|E

5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites against blacks. ADDSCO {{management}} had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense <b>contractors</b> <b>to</b> integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping them away for their safety.|$|E

5|$|Now Sunderland {{found out}} {{how hard it is}} to score against this terrific defence of ours.

What can I say to do justice to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green?

5|$|Specific design {{elements}} of the GCV were contracted out, though the Army designed the architecture and retained overall responsibility for synchronization. This contrasted with the former FCS manned ground vehicles program where contractors had {{more control over the}} design. The GCV was to be networked and offer improved survivability, while using the state-of-the-art mobility and power management functions. The military released classified details of the FCS Manned Ground Vehicles program to interested <b>contractors</b> <b>to</b> be utilized in design proposals for the GCV. The GCV family was to be built around a common chassis.|$|E
5|$|To {{supervise}} {{the construction of}} the pipeline, Alyeska appointed two construction management <b>contractors</b> <b>to</b> oversee all the other subcontractors in the project. Bechtel Corporation, from San Francisco, was named the management contractor for the pipeline itself. Fluor Alaska Inc., a division of Fluor Corp., was named the management contractor for the pumping stations and Valdez Marine Terminal, which was the most complex single section of the pipeline, since it involved the transfer of oil from the pipeline to seagoing oil tankers.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} US Department of Labor’s (DOL) governmentwide {{implementation}} of the Davis-Bacon Act, federal regulations require that all laborers and mechanics who work for a contractor or subcontractor on federally financed construction contracts over $2,000 must be paid wages not less than those the DOL established for the project location (i.e., the prevailing wage). This Compliance Requirement was created to assure that recipients oblige <b>contractors</b> <b>to</b> comply with the Davis-Bacon Act, by including in their construction contracts with a contractor or subcontractor a clause or requirement {{to comply with the}} Davis-Bacon Act and the DOL regulations. The clause should also include a requirement for the contractor or subcontractor to submit to the recipient weekly (e.g., for each week in which any contract work is performed) a copy of the construction payroll accompanied by statement of compliance. This report is commonly referred to as “certified payrolls”, and is often done using Optional Form WH-347 (OMB No. 1215-0149), a standard form pre-designed by the OMB.|$|E

5|$|By late 1962 a {{decision}} {{on whether or not}} to deploy Zeus was looming. Bell began considering a replacement for the Zeus missile that would operate at much shorter ranges, and in October, sent out study contracts to three <b>contractors</b> <b>to</b> be returned in February. Even before these were returned, in January 1963 McNamara announced that the construction funds allocated for Zeus would not be released, and the funding would instead be used for development of a new system using the latest technologies. The name Nike-X was apparently an ad hoc suggestion by Jack Ruina, the director of ARPA, who was tasked with presenting the options to the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC). With the ending of Zeus, the ZMAR radar effort was renamed MAR, and plans for an even more powerful version, MAR-II, became {{the central part of the}} Nike-X concept.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{instituted a}} series of reforms. He {{installed}} phone lines for the Supervising Construction Quartermasters, demanded weekly reports on progress, ordered that reimbursement vouchers be processed within a week, and sent expediters to sites reporting shortages. He ordered his <b>contractors</b> <b>to</b> hire whatever special equipment they needed and to pay premium prices if necessary to guarantee quick delivery. Instead of allowing construction of camps to proceed in whatever order the contractors saw fit, Groves laid down priorities for completion of camp facilities, so that the troops could begin moving in even while construction was still under way. By mid-December, {{the worst of the}} crisis was over. Over half a million men had been mobilized and essential accommodations and facilities for two million men were 95 per cent complete. Between 1 July 1940 and 10 December 1941, the Construction Division let contracts worth $1,676,293,000 ($ with inflation), of which $1,347,991,000 ($ with inflation), or about 80 per cent, were fixed-fee contracts.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{members of}} the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit {{conducted}} a measured survey of the monument. In 2005, Ashbee noted {{that he had found}} evidence of recent metal detectoring activity at the site. On 15 May 2007, the Kentish archaeologist Brian Philp was conducting his regular inspection of the monument when the property owner, Mrs Bygrave, pointed out to him an area where the road was beginning to subside. He alerted Kent County Council, who organised for <b>contractors</b> <b>to</b> investigate the reason for the subsidence, which proved to be decades of rabbit burrowing beneath the tarmac. Archaeologists from Kent Archaeological Unit visited the site during the work, discovering a buried sarsen; comparison with older records revealed that this stone had once been upright but had been buried where it stood in the 19th century by workmen who were replacing the trackway with a paved road.|$|E
40|$|While {{the control}} {{mechanisms}} of incentive contracts {{have been widely}} studied, this study attempts to determine the optimal control over a cost-plus percentage contract of a construction project. Cost-plus percentage contract shifts some risk from the <b>contractor</b> <b>to</b> client, thus offering little incentive for the <b>contractor</b> <b>to</b> control costs. The owner requires additional management over the construction project to ensure that only necessary costs are spent. The data are collected through documentation and interviews with both the owner and contractor. Empirical results indicate that multiple control mechanisms are necessary to manage properly {{the total cost of}} the projects. The owner cannot rely entirely on the <b>contractor</b> <b>to</b> control costs in a cost-plus percentage contract...|$|R

5|$|In 2004 the {{commander}} of the F-FDTL formed a team, which included international <b>contractors,</b> <b>to</b> develop a long-term strategic vision document for the military. This study was supported by the Australian Government. The resulting Force 2020 document was completed in 2006 and made public in 2007. The document sets out an 'aspirational' vision {{for the development of the}} F-FDTL to 2020 and beyond and is of equivalent status to a defence white paper. It proposes expanding the military to a strength of 3,000 regular personnel in the medium term through the introduction of conscription. It also sets longer-term goals such as establishing an air component and purchasing modern weapons, such as anti-armour weapons, armoured personnel carriers and missile boats, by 2020.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the United States {{provided}} {{funding for}} DynCorp International and Pacific Architects & Engineers, private military <b>contractors,</b> <b>to</b> train a new 4,000-man Liberian military. DynCorp was made responsible for individual training and PA unit training. In June–July 2005 the projected force strength {{was reduced to}} 2000 men. DynCorp and the U.S. Embassy scrutinized the personnel for the new armed forces thoroughly. Recruits had to pass a literacy test, an aptitude test, a drug test and an HIV test, and their names and faces were put on posters which are distributed {{to try to make}} sure none have a history of war crimes or other human rights violations. A new batch of 500 screened personnel started to arrive at the Camp Ware base at VOA Careysburg, inland from Monrovia, for initial training in early November 2007, joining 608 others who had graduated earlier.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, 2009, an {{apartment}} building at 1772 Second Avenue was evacuated by the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB) after {{it was determined that}} the building was in danger of collapse. The evacuation of the building, as well as a mixed use building at 1768 Second Avenue/301 East 92nd Street on June 29, 2009, had delayed the contractor's plan to use controlled blasting to remove bedrock in the southern section of the launch box. Until the blasting permits could be issued, MTA required <b>contractors</b> <b>to</b> use mechanical equipment to remove the bedrock, which is slower than blasting out the rock. , one building had been shored up, and work was in progress on the second; MTA had rescheduled blasting to begin during the week of November 2.|$|E
