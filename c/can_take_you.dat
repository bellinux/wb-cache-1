The conversation that was produced by this question impressed Munroe's mother {{to such a degree}} that she wrote it down. Though Munroe later stated that his question was rather meaningless, he used it as an example of how [...] "thoroughly answer a stupid question <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to some pretty interesting places".|$|E

The song opens with Bieber using a lower-register and breathy vocals while rapping, [...] "If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go/ I <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> places you ain’t never been before/ Baby, take a chance or you’ll never ever know/ I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow/ Swag, swag, swag on you/ Chillin' by the fire while we eatin’ fondue." [...] As the chorus follows, he adopts a Michael Jackson similar falsetto, and sings about being [...] "everything you want".|$|E

500|$|Of {{working with}} Stewart and The-Dream, Lopez stated that: [...] "What I love about great {{producers}} and writers {{is that they}} <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> and transport you right into this moment, but not change you. And that's what I feel like Tricky and Dream did with this record. They took that 'Jenny from the Block' side of me, which {{is still very much}} a part of who I am and will always be, and they put it right there on that track". According to Scott Shetler of PopCrush, [...] "Run the World" [...] contains an optimistic message and upbeat melody. Shetler particularly noted the lyric [...] "Our love could run the world" [...] as a good example of the optimism in the song.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from their}} protests, Theroux {{found them to}} be quite kind, and commented, [...] "It shows you what strange avenues the {{religious}} impulse <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> down. I think another part of the answer is that parts of the Christian Bible are pretty weird. There's a lot of weird stuff in there and when you take that and you add this angry, domineering kind of a father figure, which is Gramps, and you add that he has sort of separated them off from other people, other families and driven them to achieve a lot, and he was kind of a charismatic guy, and still is up to a point. He was a very verbal, very persuasive, an extremely compelling speaker. All these things added together combined to make a powerful influence." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{psychedelic}} rock version by the Misunderstood {{was recorded}} in 1966 and released as the B-side to the [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> to the Sun" [...] single on Fontana Records. [...] Author Dave Thompson writes, [...] "The Misunderstood pumped it up but kept it short, psychedelic sound effects, heart attack drums, [...] eerie harmonics". [...] Misunderstood guitarist Glenn Ross Campbell reworked [...] "Who Do You Love" [...] with his later band, Juicy Lucy, which reached number 14 in the UK Singles Chart in 1970. [...] The song features Campbell's psychedlic steel guitar lines, which Thompson describes [...] "as fast and mean and dirty as any record could have been, a breakneck tour through the bayou swamps and dirt-track roads of the American South, powered by a guitar to make your fingers bleed".|$|E

He championed their music throughout his career; in 1968, he described their 1966 single [...] "I <b>Can</b> <b>Take</b> <b>You</b> to the Sun" [...] as [...] "the best popular record that's ever been recorded." [...] and shortly before his death, he stated, [...] "If I had to list the ten greatest performances I've seen in my life, one would be The Misunderstood at Pandora's Box, Hollywood, 1966 ... My god, they were a great band!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The track's ambient, sparse and pitched-down {{production}} contains minor sound bursts {{and finger}} clicks, comprising percussion instrumentation, drum machines, a transparent and airy synthesizer, and minimalistic bass. Its production was noted to recall Rocky's discography, namely At.Long.Last.A$AP. According {{to the music}} sheet published at Musicnotes.com by The Royalty Network, the song is composed in the common time signature and {{is set in the}} key of F minor, having a moderate tempo of 89 beats per minute. It follows a basic sequence of Fm–A–B–Fm–E as its chord progression, except in the bridge, which has a sequence of C♯m and the lyrics [...] "Trust me, I <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> there / Trust me, I / Trust me, I / Trust me, I", and during Rocky's verse, where the chords of C, E and D are repeated in sequence. Gomez solicits a slightly raspy, deliberate, slow and breathy vocal in the song, while making use of mumbling, crooning and cooing techniques, and a plaintive timbre. Her vocal range spans the low note of C3 to the high note of B4. Her voice was compared to that of Imogen Heap, Lana Del Rey, and Lorde; she clips her enunciation and breaks her vowels on words such as [...] "good" [...] which she phrases as [...] "guh-eeed".|$|E

He met a {{stranger}} in a pub who said [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> to some digs but I wouldn't recommend them exactly," [...] and then led Pinter to the house where he stayed. Pinter told his official biographer, Michael Billington, I went to these digs and found, in short, a very big woman who was the landlady and a little man, the landlord. There {{was no one else}} there, apart from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... I slept in the attic with this man I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic and there was a sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from which hairs and dust fell continuously.
