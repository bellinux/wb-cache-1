2500|$|Since 2010, {{there has}} been {{extensive}} international media coverage on Stuxnet and its aftermath. In early commentary, The Economist pointed out that Stuxnet was [...] "a new kind of cyber-attack."

In that piece, Kim Zetter claimed that Stuxnet's [...] "cost–benefit ratio is still in question." [...] Later commentators {{tended to focus on}} the strategic significance of Stuxnet as a cyber weapon. Following the Wired piece, Holger Stark called Stuxnet the [...] "first digital weapon of geopolitical importance, it could change the way wars are fought." [...] Meanwhile, Eddie Walsh referred to Stuxnet as [...] "the world's newest high-end asymmetric threat." [...] Ultimately, some claim that the [...] "extensive media coverage afforded to Stuxnet has only served as an advertisement for the vulnerabilities used by various <b>cybercriminal</b> groups." [...] While that may be the case, the media coverage has also increased awareness of cyber security threats.|$|E

50|$|In April 2017, it was {{reported}} that a <b>cybercriminal</b> had stolen the first ten episodes of the fifth season in a security breach of a post-production company. Netflix failed to respond to ransom demands, and the <b>cybercriminal</b> leaked the episodes online. Netflix confirmed the security breach and an ongoing investigation by federal law enforcement. Multichannel News reported that demand for the series significantly increased over the seven-day period following the leak of the episodes.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an overview of}} some of the tools that <b>cybercriminals</b> employ to trade securely. It will look at the weaknesses of these tools and how the behavior of <b>cybercriminals</b> will sometimes lead them to use tools in a nonoptimal manner, creating opportunities for law enforcement to identify and apprehend them. The criminal domain this article focuses on is carding, the online trade in stolen payment card details and the consequent criminal misuse of such data. However, these findings could be applied more broadly, as many of the analyzed tools are used across (cyber) criminal domains. This article is a continuation of earlier work, in which a crime script analysis of 25 carding tutorials presented the tools that <b>cybercriminals</b> use to cash-out stolen payment card details while remaining anonymous. We use these tutorials and an analysis of the literature to identify how they can be used incorrectly and create a typology of potential behavioral and technological pitfalls in these tools. Finally, we conclude that finding pitfalls in the usage of tools by <b>cybercriminals</b> has the potential to increase the efficiency of disruption, interception, and prevention approaches. However, in future work, interviews with law enforcement experts and convicted <b>cybercriminals</b> or still active users should be used to analyze the operational security of <b>cybercriminals</b> in more depth...|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>cybercriminals</b> be assessed in terms of their criminal attributes, which include skills, knowledge, resources, access and motives (SKRAM). <b>Cybercriminals</b> usually have a high degree of these attributes and this is why SCP may prove more useful than traditional approaches to crime.

50|$|Sextortion via {{the use of}} webcams is also a concern, {{especially}} for those who use webcams for flirting and cybersex. Often this involves a <b>cybercriminal</b> posing as someone else - such as an attractive person - initiating communication of a sexual nature with the victim (about 95% of victims are male). Often, the <b>cybercriminal</b> simply shows a pre-recorded video of a performer from a cybersex webcam site which they are sufficiently familiar with to message the victim at points in the video where the performer appears to be typing on the keyboard, to give the illusion to the victim that it is actually the performer in the video messaging them. The victim is then persuaded to undress {{in front of a}} webcam, and may also be persuaded to engage in sexual behaviour, such as masturbation. The video is recorded by the <b>cybercriminal,</b> who then reveals their true intent and demands money or other services (such as more explicit images of the victim, in cases of online predation), threatening to publicly release the video and send it to family members and friends of the victim if they do not comply. A video highlighting the dangers of sextortion has been released by the National Crime Agency in the UK to educate people, especially given the fact that blackmail of a sexual nature may cause humiliation to a sufficient extent to cause the victim to take their own life, in addition to other efforts to educate the public on the risks of sextortion.|$|E
40|$|Credit card fraud {{has seen}} rampant {{increase}} in the past years, as customers use credit cards and similar financial instruments frequently. Both online and brick-and-mortar outfits repeatedly fall victim to <b>cybercriminals</b> who siphon off credit card information in bulk. Despite the many and creative ways that attackers use to steal and trade credit card information, the stolen information can rarely be used to withdraw money directly, due to protection mechanisms such as PINs and cash advance limits. As such, <b>cybercriminals</b> have had to devise more advanced monetization schemes to work around the current restrictions. One monetization scheme that has been steadily gaining traction are reshipping scams. In such scams, <b>cybercriminals</b> purchase high-value or highly-demanded products from online merchants using stolen payment instruments, and then ship the items to a credulous citizen. This person, who has been recruited by the scammer under the guise o...|$|R
40|$|We {{set out to}} {{understand}} the effects of differing language {{on the ability of}} <b>cybercriminals</b> to navigate webmail accounts and locate sensitive information in them. To this end, we configured thirty Gmail honeypot accounts with English, Romanian, and Greek language settings. We populated the accounts with email messages in those languages by subscribing them to selected online newsletters. We hid email messages about fake bank accounts in fifteen of the accounts to mimic real-world webmail users that sometimes store sensitive information in their accounts. We then leaked credentials to the honey accounts via paste sites on the Surface Web and the Dark Web, and collected data for fifteen days. Our statistical analyses on the data show that <b>cybercriminals</b> are more likely to discover sensitive information (bank account information) in the Greek accounts than the remaining accounts, contrary to the expectation that Greek ought to constitute a barrier to the understanding of non-Greek visitors to the Greek accounts. We also extracted the important words among the emails that <b>cybercriminals</b> accessed (as an approximation of the keywords that they searched for within the honey accounts), and found that financial terms featured among the top words. In summary, we show that language plays {{a significant role in the}} ability of <b>cybercriminals</b> to access sensitive information hidden in compromised webmail accounts...|$|R

Even if an antivirus firm locates the <b>cybercriminal</b> behind {{the creation of}} a particular virus or piece of malware or form of cyber attack, often the local authorities cannot take action due to lack of laws under which to prosecute. Authorship attribution for cyber crimes and cyber attacks is a major problem for all law enforcement agencies.|$|E
50|$|On June 5, 2017, {{a message}} from a {{believed}} to be <b>cybercriminal</b> stated that eight episodes of this series were already online.

However, ABC had no public comment about the piracy of the show, which was not expected to affect the show's viewership because the target audience was considered unlikely to use piracy websites.|$|E
50|$|The broad {{diffusion}} of <b>cybercriminal</b> activities {{is an issue}} in computer crimes detection and prosecution.According to Jean-Loup Richet (Research Fellow at ESSEC ISIS), technical expertise and accessibility no longer act as barriers to entry into cybercrime. Indeed, hacking is much less complex {{than it was a}} few years ago, as hacking communities have greatly diffused their knowledge through the Internet. Blogs and communities have hugely contributed to information sharing: beginners could benefit from older hackers' knowledge and advice. Furthermore, Hacking is cheaper than ever: before the cloud computing era, in order to spam or scam one needed a dedicated server, skills in server management, network configuration, and maintenance, knowledge of Internet service provider standards, etc. By comparison, a mail software-as-a-service is a scalable, inexpensive, bulk, and transactional e-mail-sending service for marketing purposes and could be easily set up for spam. Jean-Loup Richet explains that cloud computing could be helpful for a <b>cybercriminal</b> as a way to leverage his attack - brute-forcing a password, improve the reach of a botnet, or facilitating a spamming campaign.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to easily}} exploitable laws, <b>cybercriminals</b> use {{developing}} countries {{in order to}} evade detection and prosecution from law enforcement. In developing countries, such as the Philippines, laws against cybercrime are weak or sometimes nonexistent. These weak laws allow <b>cybercriminals</b> to strike from international borders and remain undetected. Even when identified, these criminals avoid being punished or extradited to a country, such as the United States, that has developed laws that allow for prosecution. While this proves difficult in some cases, agencies, such as the FBI, have used deception and subterfuge to catch criminals. For example, two Russian hackers had been evading the FBI for some time. The FBI set up a fake computing company based in Seattle, Washington. They proceeded to lure the two Russian men into the United States by offering them work with this company. Upon completion of the interview, the suspects were arrested outside of the building. Clever tricks like this are sometimes {{a necessary part of}} catching <b>cybercriminals</b> when weak legislation makes it impossible otherwise.|$|R
