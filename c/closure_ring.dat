5000|$|When fitting new {{piston rings}} or {{breaking}} them in within an engine, {{the end gap}} is a crucial measurement. In order that a ring may be fitted into the [...] "grooves" [...] of the piston, it is not continuous but is broken at one point on its circumference. The ring gap may be checked by putting the ring into the bore/liner (squared to bore) and measuring with a feeler gauge. End gap should be within recommended limits for size of bore and intended [...] "load" [...] of engine. Metals expand with a rise in temperature, so too small a gap may result in overlapping or bending when used under hot running conditions (racing, heavy loads, towing) and, even at normal temperatures, a small ring gap may lead to ring gap <b>closure,</b> <b>ring</b> breakage, bore damage and possible seizure of the piston. Too large a gap may give unacceptable compression and levels of blow-by gases or oil consumption. When being measured in a used bore, it may indicate excessive bore wear or ring wear. (Radial wear on ring face reduces thickness of used/worn ring (face wear in bore) essentially decreasing face circumference of ring and thereby increasing size of ring end gap.) ...|$|E

40|$|Results {{of tests}} of drum-type RAM {{packages}} employing conventional clamp-ring closures have caused {{concern over the}} DOT 6 M Specification Package. To clarify these issues, {{a series of tests}} were performed to determine the response of the clamp-ring closure to the regulatory Hypothetical Accident Condition (9 m) drop tests, for packages at maximum allowable weight. Three enhanced closure designs were also tested: the Clamshell, plywood disk reinforcement, and J-Clip. The results of the tests showed that the standard closure was unable to retain the top for both Center-of-Gravity-Over-Corner and Shallow Angle cases, for the standard package, at its maximum allowed weight. Similar results were found for packages dropped from a reduced height. The Clamshell design provided the best performance of the enhanced closures. It was concluded that the <b>closure</b> <b>ring</b> design employed on the 6 M is inadequate to retain the top during the regulatory test sequence, for packages at the maximum allowed weight. For large heavy packages, the Center-of-Gravity- Over-Corner case is more challenging than the Shallow Angle case.

40|$|A {{sectional}} {{view of the}} HI-STORM dry storage system has been presented earlier (see Figure 1. 2. 1). The system consists of a sealed MPC situated inside a vertical ventilated storage overpack. Air inlet and outlet ducts that allow for air cooling of the stored MPC are located {{at the bottom and}} top, respectively, of the cylindrical overpack. The SNF assemblies reside inside the MPC, which is sealed with a welded lid to form the confinement boundary. The MPC contains an all-alloy honeycomb basket structure with square-shaped compartments of appropriate dimensions to allow insertion of the fuel assemblies prior to welding of the IPC lid and <b>closure</b> <b>ring.</b> Each box panel, with the exception of exterior panels on the MPC- 68 andMPC- 32, is equipped with a Boral (thermal neutron absorber) panel sandwiched between an alloy steel sheathing plate and the box panel, along {{the entire length of the}} active fuel region. The MPC is backfilled with helium up to the design-basis initial fill level (Table 1. 2. 2). This provides a stable, inert environment for long-term storage of the SNF. Heat is rejected from the SNF in the HI-STORM System to the environment by passive heat transport mechanisms only. The helium backfill gas is an integral part of the MPC thermal design. The helium fills all the spaces between solid components and provides an improved conduction medium (compared to air) fo...|$|E

Electron donating groups on the imine facilitate this step, while electron-withdrawing groups impede the attack.

In each case where <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> occurs, a metal CO is ultimately substituted by the side chain functional group. Photoacoustic calorimetry studies reveal that <b>ring</b> <b>closures</b> occur with rate constants faster than 10 7 s- 1 or between 10 6 – 10 7 s- 1, {{or in some cases}} the <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> is biphasic with rate constants in both ranges. The enthalpies of CO dissociation followed by <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> for 2 and 3 are the same (12 kcal/mol) and more favorable than those for 4 - 6 (25 - 15 kcal/mol). Studies of 1 - 3 by transient ps to µs infrared spectroscopy further indicate biphasic dynamics for 2 and 3 : <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> occurs immediately (k> 5 x 10 9 s- 1) and at slower rates (k = 10 8 – 10 6 s- 1). We propose that some <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> occurs before solvent coordination and that the remaining <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> is much slower resulting in the displacement of solvent. The relationships of the rates and energetics of <b>ring</b> <b>closure</b> to structure and quantum yields are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Glass lined {{reactor vessel}} for mixing and storage {{has a unique}} {{advantage}} of higher corrosion resistance, retention of product flavour and purity, improved heat transfer and less frequent cleaning. Welding close to the glass-lined surface is at times the unavoidable need. However, such needs are to be dealt critically as {{the rise in the}} temperature of the glass-lined surface can lead to a failure of glass-lining. This failure results in considerable delay as rework in lining the glass takes 5 - 7 days and it involves considerable extra cost of reworking. The glass lined reactor vessels are provided with jacket for thermal insulation. The jacket is welded to main vessel by a <b>closure</b> <b>ring.</b> CO 2 welding in the root run and Sub-merged Arc Welding (SAW) process for subsequent passes. The cooling time of 15 to 20 minutes is provided between the successive SAW passes so that the shell surface cools down and temperature does not exceed the failure limit of glass-lining. The temperature measurements were initially measured with infrared pyrometer and Results are compared with thermal analysis by FEA. We see in the final pass of SAW process the temperature exceeds 100 ˚C though the cooling time of 15 - 20 minutes is provided between the successive passes and temperature does not exceeds the failure limit of 150 ˚C as well as the 3 - 4 ˚C/min temperature difference in heating and cooling rates...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the drop test {{results for the}} 9975 radioactive material shipping package being dropped 30 feet onto a unyielding surface followed by a 40 -inch puncture pin drop. The purpose of these drops was {{to show that the}} package lid would remain attached to the drum. The 30 -foot drop was designed to weaken the lid closure lug while still maintaining maximum extension of the lugs from the drum surface. This was accomplished by angling the drum approximately 30 degrees from horizontal in an inverted position. In this position, the drum was rotated slightly so as not to embed the closure lugs into the drum {{as a result of the}} 30 -foot drop. It was determined that this orientation would maximize deformation to the <b>closure</b> <b>ring</b> around the closure lug while still maintaining the extension of the lugs from the package surface. The second drop was from 40 inches above a 40 -inch tall 6 -inch diameter puncture pin. The package was angled 10 degrees from vertical and aligned over the puncture pin to solidly hit the drum lug(s) in an attempt to disengage the lid when dropped. Tests were performed in response to DOE EM- 76 review Q 5 inquires that questioned the capability of the 9975 drum lid to remain in place under this test sequence. Two packages were dropped utilizing this sequence, a 9974 and 9975. Test results for the 9974 package are reported in WSRC-RP- 97 - 00945. A series of 40 -inch puncture pin tests were also performed on undamaged 9975 and 9974 packages...|$|E

40|$|DOT, DOE and NRC Type A and Type B {{radioactive}} material (RAM) transport packages routinely use industrial or military specification drums with conventional clamp <b>ring</b> <b>closures</b> as an overpack.
