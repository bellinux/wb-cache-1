5|$|The Brooklyn Free School holds a weekly, {{mandatory}} Democratic Meeting on Wednesday mornings. The meeting {{runs the}} school, and {{students and teachers}} alike have equal votes. Students {{are not required to}} pay attention. Meeting topics range from disciplinary grievances to admissions to <b>computer</b> <b>use.</b> A meeting chair is chosen {{at the beginning of the}} meeting and the floor is opened for propositions. Anyone wishing to discuss a school issue can call schoolwide meetings.|$|E
5|$|RNC {{hosts the}} UK's first VI Sports Academy, having begun {{as the home}} of the first {{football}} academy for visually impaired players and the England blind football team. It hosted the 2010 World Blind Football Championship and also served as a training facility for participants in the 2012 Paralympic Games. The college is actively involved in the development of assistive technology, including student participation in the Tech Novice Cafe, run for members of the public who are not confident in <b>computer</b> <b>use.</b> Two notable devices were developed at RNC; the Mountbatten Brailler, an electronic braille writer, and the T3, a talking tactile device that helped with the reading of maps and diagrams.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} system is distributed as a Live CD and Live USB (full X11 flavour available) that boots into a complete DragonFly system. It includes the base {{system and a}} complete set of manual pages, and may include source code and useful packages in future versions. The advantage of this is that with a single CD you can install the software onto a <b>computer,</b> <b>use</b> a full set of tools to repair a damaged installation, or demonstrate the capabilities of the system without installing it. Daily snapshots are available from the master site {{for those who want to}} install the most recent versions of DragonFly without building from source.|$|E

5|$|A Folding@home {{participant}} installs {{a client}} program {{on their personal}} computer. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. The client connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home {{with the ability to}} efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} {{developments}} {{were included in the}} Alto, which added the now familiar Stanford Research Institute (SRI) developed mouse, unifying into a single model most aspects of now-standard personal <b>computer</b> <b>use.</b> The integration of Ethernet prompted the development of the PARC Universal Packet architecture, much like today's Internet.|$|E
25|$|By the 2010s, the {{circumstances}} of computer crime had changed along with legitimate <b>computer</b> <b>use.</b> Criminals {{were more likely to}} use the Internet to facilitate their crimes, and as such needed to remain online most of the time. To do so, and still keep their activities discreet, they used computer security features like lock screens and password protection.|$|E

25|$|Cyberslacking {{can become}} a drain on {{corporate}} resources; the average UK employee spent 57 minutes a day surfing the Web while at work, according to a 2003 study by Peninsula Business Services. Internet addiction disorder is excessive <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> that interferes with daily life. Nicholas G. Carr believes that Internet use has other effects on individuals, for instance improving skills of scan-reading and interfering with the deep thinking that leads to true creativity.|$|E
25|$|As a {{response}} to a possible drop in academic performance due to non-academic use of the laptops during the school day, <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> was for the first time restricted for all students in the 2005–06 academic school year.

Kildall's final business venture, known as Prometheus Light and Sound (PLS) and based in Austin, Texas, developed a home PBX system that integrated land-line telephones with mobile phones.|$|E
25|$|A system {{widely used}} in Europe known as the Mullard–Philips tube designation, also {{extended}} to transistors, uses a letter, followed {{by one or more}} further letters, and a number. The type designator specifies the heater voltage or current (one letter), the functions of all sections of the tube (one letter per section), the socket type (first digit), and the particular tube (remaining digits). For example, the ECC83 (equivalent to the 12AX7) is a 6.3V (E) double triode (CC) with a miniature base (8). In this system special-quality tubes (e.g., for long-life <b>computer</b> <b>use)</b> are indicated by moving the number immediately after the first letter: the E83CC is a special-quality equivalent of the ECC83, the E55L a power pentode with no consumer equivalent.|$|E
25|$|Just as the {{development}} of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it made possible much more complex ciphers. Furthermore, computers allowed for the encryption {{of any kind of}} data representable in any binary format, unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts; this was new and significant. <b>Computer</b> <b>use</b> has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography, both for cipher design and cryptanalysis. Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on binary bit sequences (sometimes in groups or blocks), unlike classical and mechanical schemes, which generally manipulate traditional characters (i.e., letters and digits) directly. However, computers have also assisted cryptanalysis, which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity. Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis; it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient (i.e., fast and requiring few resources, such as memory or CPU capability), while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger, and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher, making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.|$|E

In 2015 Kaspersky and Kaspersky Lab discovered a group of hackers known as Carbanak that were stealing money from banks. They also exposed Equation Group, which {{developed a}}dvanced spyware for monitoring <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> and {{was believed to be}} affiliated with the National Security Agency in the U.S. According to The Economist, it was these discoveries, Kaspersky's [...] "relentless salesmanship" [...] and the company's anti-virus product that made Kaspersky Lab uncommon as an internationally recognized Russian company.|$|E
500|$|Like all BOINC projects, Rosetta@home {{runs in the}} {{background}} of the user's computer, using idle computer power, either at or before logging into an account on the host operating system. [...] The program frees resources from the CPU as they are needed by other applications so that normal <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> is unaffected. [...] Many program settings can be specified via user account preferences, including: the maximum percentage of CPU resources the program can use (to control power consumption or heat production from a computer running at sustained capacity), the times of day during which the program can run, and many more.|$|E
500|$|The {{high quality}} of the {{animation}} in Madlax was generally acknowledged. On the negative side, the episodes that involve <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> and hacking received criticism for their lack of realism. In terms of soundtrack, Madlax has not become as innovative as Noir, with critics suggesting its OST to be a blend of Noir and [...]hack//Sign styles. Nevertheless, the reviewers acknowledged its superiority over the majority of contemporary works. The English translation released by ADV Films was praised for preserving most of the series' original stylistic aspects and inviting veteran voice actors for the dub. Reviewers {{went as far as}} to suggest that several English voices (especially Mike Kleinhenz's) match the characters better than the Japanese ones. Others, however, criticized the dub, e.g. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network in his 2009 review of the series rated the performance as [...] "wildly uneven, ranging from good... to plain amateurish", citing [...] "delivery issues" [...] as main problem of the dub.|$|E

2500|$|In Polish, such a mark {{is known}} as a kreska (...) and is an {{integral}} part of several letters: four consonants and one vowel. When appearing in consonants, it indicates palatalization, similar to the use of the háček in Czech and other Slavic languages (e.g. sześć [...] "six"). However, in contrast to the háček which is usually used for postalveolar consonants, the kreska denotes alveolo-palatal consonants. In traditional Polish typography, the kreska is more nearly vertical than the acute accent, and placed slightly right of center. A similar rule applies to the Belarusian Latin alphabet Lacinka. However, for <b>computer</b> <b>use,</b> Unicode conflates the codepoints for these letters with those of the accented Latin letters of similar appearance.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{children}} fail {{to exercise}} {{because they are}} spending time doing immobile activities such as computer usage, playing video games or watching television. Technology has a large factor on the children's activeness. Researchers provided a technology questionnaire to 4,561 children, ages 14, 16, and 18. They discovered [...] children were 21.5% {{more likely to be}} overweight when watching 4+ hours of TV per day, 4.5% more likely to be overweight when using a computer one or more hours per day, and unaffected by potential weight gain from playing video games. A randomized trial showed that reducing TV viewing and <b>computer</b> <b>use</b> can decrease age-adjusted BMI; reduced calorie intake was thought to be the greatest contributor to the BMI decrease.|$|E
