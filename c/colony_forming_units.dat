To do so, the HSC pool size has to be maintained by HSC self-renewing divisions. PRDM 3 and PRDM 16 have been documented to regulate HSC self-renewal, maintenance and function. We found Prdm 11 to have similar expression patterns in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartments as Prdm 3 and Prdm 16. Therefore, we undertook experiments to test if PRDM 11 regulates HSC self-renewal, maintenance and function by investigating the Prdm 11 −/− mice. Our data shows that phenotypic HSPCs are intact in bone marrow (BM) of one-year-old Prdm 11 −/− mice. In addition, Prdm 11 −/− mice were able to fully regenerate the hematopoietic system upon BM transplantation (BMT) into lethally irradiated mice with a mild drop in lymphoid output only. Taken together, this suggests that PRDM 11, in contrast to PRDM 3 and PRDM 16, is not directly involved in regulation of HSPCs in mice...|$|R
