40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>China</b> <b>and</b> <b>India’s</b> relationship {{within the}} ambit of the G 20 {{process and the}} autonomous BRICS institutional architecture. The evolving relationship {{of each of these}} two emerging powers within these different institutional settings demonstrates a degree of agentic commonality <b>and</b> distinction. <b>China’s</b> <b>and</b> <b>India’s</b> approaches to both the G 20 and the BRICS summit processes high-light a combination of status-seeking and hedging behaviour. While China’s cautious approach is complemented by assertive leadership in matters of national interest, India’s leadership has a very specific orientation towards developmental issues. Whereas China’s approach focuses on the United States {{and the rest of the}} West, India’s approach is increasingly positioned as a response to China...|$|R

5|$|He helped broker the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an {{international}} treaty designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

5|$|Academic {{study of}} Barbadian music remains limited.

Due {{to a lack of}} archaeological and historical records, the island's indigenous music is unknown. Since the 1970s, an increase in general interest in Barbadian culture has spurred greater study of music, and given an incentive to radio and television stations to create and maintain archives of cultural practices.|$|E

Countries that were considered to be developing, such as <b>China</b> <b>and</b> <b>India,</b> were not required to approve the treaty because they were more concerned that restricting emissions would further restrain their development.|$|E

The complexity of Malagasy meals can range from the simple, traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers, to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island's 19th-century monarchs. Although the classic Malagasy meal of rice and its accompaniment remains predominant, over the past 100 years other food types and combinations have been popularized by French colonists and immigrants from <b>China</b> <b>and</b> <b>India.</b> Consequently, Malagasy cuisine is traditional while also assimilating newly emergent cultural influences.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the {{sustained}} rise {{in oil prices}} had only a limited impact on demand. It was a good year across all segments of the tanker market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the tanker shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five tanker freight indices dropped during 2006. Product tanker demand increased in 2006 due to economic expansion in Asia, especially <b>China</b> <b>and</b> <b>India,</b> however, average time charter equivalent earnings for these ships decreased compared with the two prior years.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Timothy Searchinger, {{a lawyer}} from Environmental Defense Fund, {{concluded}} that ILUC affects {{the life cycle}} assessment and that instead of saving, both corn and cellulosic ethanol increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively. Ethanol from Brazilian sugarcane performed better, recovering initial carbon emissions in 4 years, while U.S. corn ethanol required 167 years and cellulosic ethanol required a 52 years payback period. The study limited the analysis a 30-year period, assuming that land conversion emits 25 percent of the carbon stored in soils and all carbon in plants cleared for cultivation. Brazil, <b>China,</b> <b>and</b> <b>India</b> were considered among the overseas locations where land use change would occur {{as a result of}} diverting U.S. corn cropland, and it was assumed that new cropland in each of these regions correspond to different types of forest, savanna or grassland based on the historical proportion of each converted to cultivation in these countries during the 1990s.|$|E

However, DOE's SunShot Initiative has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices {{to be in the}} range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt. Other sources identify similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 for the different market segments in the U.S., and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014. In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $2.90 per watt. Costs for utility-scale systems in <b>China</b> <b>and</b> <b>India</b> were estimated as low as $1.00 per watt.|$|E
