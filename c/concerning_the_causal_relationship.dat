The availability of these services can affect the value of children's time and, concomitantly, household decisions concerning how this time is allocated between school and work. This paper investigates the link between child labour and water and electricity access in five countries – El Salvador, Ghana, Guatemala, Morocco and Yemen. Employing an econometric methodology based on propensity scores {{for dealing with the}} potential endogeneity of access to water and electricity, average treatment effects for water and electricity access on children's activities are presented. The marginal effects of water and electricity access on children's activities obtained by estimating a bivariate probit model are also examined.

40|$|Computing {{applications}} for among others well-being and health become increasingly advanced {{as a result}} of their sensor-based awareness of the context in which they are used. Context-aware applications have the potential of providing enriched services to their users, i. e. services that are appropriate for the context at hand. A challenge for the design of context-aware applications is to identify and develop service enrichments which are effective and useful while not being overly complex and costly. It is hard to imagine, both for the designer and end-user, all possible relevant contexts and best possible corresponding enriched services. An enriched service which is not appropriate for the context at hand can irritate or even harm the user, and (eventually) leads to avoiding the use of the service. This paper discusses a model-driven approach that incorporates domain knowledge <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between context factors and human conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background Sarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} disease of unknown etiology, in which granulomas develop in various organs, including the skin, lungs, eyes, or heart. It {{has been reported}} that patients with sarcoidosis are more likely to develop panic disorder than members of the general population. However, there are many unknown factors <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between these conditions. Case presentation We present the case of a 57 -year-old woman who appeared to have panic disorder, as she experienced repeated panic attacks induced by transient complete atrioventricular block, associated with cardiac sarcoidosis. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy were not effective in the treatment of her panic attacks. However, when we implanted a permanent pacemaker and initiated steroid treatment for cardiac sarcoidosis, panic attacks were ameliorated. Based on these findings, we diagnosed the patient 2 ̆ 019 s symptoms as an anxiety disorder associated with cardiac sarcoidosis, rather than panic disorder. Conclusions This report highlights the importance of considering cardiac sarcoidosis in the differential diagnosis of panic disorder. This cardiac disease should be considered especially in patients have a history of cardiac disease (e. g., arrhythmia) and atypical presentations of panic symptoms. Panic disorder is a psychiatric condition that is typically diagnosed after other medical conditions have been excluded. Because the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is difficult in some patients, caution is required. The palpitations and symptoms of heart failure associated with cardiac sarcoidosis can be misdiagnosed as psychiatric symptoms of panic disorder. The condition described in the current case study appears to constitute a physical disease, the diagnosis of which requires significant consideration and caution...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{two major}} topics which have recently received considerable {{attention in the}} financial econometrics literature: (i) long memory GARCH models and (ii) GARCH-in-Mean models with nonparametric specifications. Chapter 1 contains an introduction. Chapter 2 {{is concerned with the}} Fractionally Integrated GARCH(p,d,q) model of Baillie et al. (1996). We derive conditions on the parameters of the FIGARCH(p,d,q) process which guarantee the nonnegativity of the conditional variance. The conditions are necessary and sufficient for p {{less than or equal to}} two and sufficient for p greater than two. In Chapter 3 we turn to the Long Memory GARCH process of Karanasos et al. (2004). We derive convenient representations for the impulse response function which can be used to measure the persistence of shocks to the conditional variance. Chapters 4 and 5 are concerned with the empirical application of dual long memory models. In a first step, ARFIMA-FIGARCH models are applied to analyze the dynamics of European and international inflation data. In a second step, Granger methods are used to test several hypotheses <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between inflation, nominal uncertainty and output growth. Chapter 6 deals with the GARCH-in-Mean model of Engle et al. (1987). In this model the risk premium is usually assumed to be either a linear or logarithmic function of the conditional variance or conditional standard deviation. We propose a specification test for the functional form of the risk premium in the GARCH-in-Mean model. The test statistic employs a nonparametric estimate of the shape of the risk premium...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Education {{plays an}} {{important}} role in improving Chinese rural laborers' non-farm incomes. However, in Chinese western rural area, the level of return to education is very low due to the underdeveloped economy and the condition of the education system. For improving the schooling returns level, Chinese central government is paying great attention to the condition of education in the rural western area. To date, no research has examined what educational style is more favorable for improving western rural laborers' non-farm incomes. To answer this question, the purpose of this paper is to compare the treatment effect of high school education and secondary vocational education on their non-farm incomes. That will provide significant evidence for the government to carry out educational policy. Design/methodology/approach - Base on the Mincer model, several methods is used to estimate the average return to a year education on western rural labors' non-farm income, including OLS, IV and Heckman tow-steps method, to accounting for the ability endogenous and self-selection bias. And the propensity score matching method is used in estimate the treatment effects of high school education and secondary vocational education. Findings - The results from Mincer model showed that the schooling returns in Chinese western rural area were estimated to range from 2. 7 to 3. 9 percent, that were lower than the average levels in Chinese whole rural area that are estimated in the other recent studies. By using propensity score matching to roll out the heterogeneous bias, show that the treatment effect from high school education was higher than that from secondary vocational education, indicating that the secondary vocational education is better. Originality/value - Studies <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between schooling (high school education and secondary vocational education) and non-farm earnings in the western region of China remain very limited, even empty. This paper will make an update contribution to the literature in the area of education earnings in China...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} <b>concerned</b> with <b>the</b> <b>causal</b> <b>relationship</b> between traffic {{interventions}} and road safety. It focuses on two {{issues that have}} been overlooked in the existing empirical literature: {{the establishment of a}} causal link between traffic interventions and road traffic accidents, and the application and development of formal causal approaches, which have not yet been applied in the field of road safety. In the past decades substantial studies have been conducted to investigate the risk factors contributing to road accidents. It has been shown that the frequency and severity of road accidents are associated with various factors, including traffic characteristics, road environment and demographic characteristics. However, the existence of a causal link between traffic interventions and road accidents remains unclear due to the complex character of traffic interventions. Meanwhile, the lack of formal causal models makes it difficult fully to address issues such as confounding effects and regression to the mean bias. This thesis begins by reviewing and discussing different types of traffic interventions in order to demonstrate the chains through which traffic interventions are related to road safety. To address the shortcomings in empirical literature, three models for causal inferences are discussed: the difference-in-difference method, the propensity score matching method and Bayesian methods. These formal causal approaches are then applied to three empirical studies: the London congestion charging scheme, speed limit enforcement cameras, and the road network design. The conventional models are also employed and compared with formal causal models. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|A large {{literature}} documents {{a substantial}} rise in U. S. wage inequality and educational wage differentials during the 1980 s and early 1990 s and concludes that these wage structure {{changes can be}} accounted for by shifts in the supply of and demand for skills reinforced by the erosion of labor market institutions supporting low- and middlewage workers. Drawing on an additional decade of data, several “revisionist ” studies reject this consensus to conclude that (1) the rise in wage inequality was an “episodic ” event of the first-half of the 1980 s, (2) this rise was mainly caused by a falling minimum wage, and (3) increased residual wage inequality since the mid- 1980 s reflects the confounding effects of labor force composition. We reexamine these claims using data from the Current Population Survey for 1963 to 2005 and find only limited support. A slowing of the growth of overall wage inequality in the 1990 s hides a divergence in the paths of upper-tail (90 / 50) and lower-tail (50 / 10) inequality. Uppertail wage inequality has been increasing steadily since 1980 even after adjusting for labor force composition changes. Lower-tail wage inequality increased sharply in the first-half of the 1980 s but has flattened or narrowed since the late 1980 s.

The present paper first reviews the evidence in favour of the three most influential of these (Leiter and Maslach's model (1988); Golembiewski, Boudreau, Munzenrider, 2 ̆ 6 amp; Luo's (1996) phase model; and Lee and Ashforth's model (1993)). These three models, and our own model (which integrates of two of them, and includes feedback effects of depersonalization on emotional exhaustion) are then compared with each other using structural equation modelling, drawing on longitudinal data from two Dutch samples (total N= 1185). The review revealed that none of the seven previous studies on this issue provided any convincing support for any particular causal order proposed so far. In contrast, our own study showed that high levels of exhaustion were associated with high levels of depersonalization over time across both samples. Further, higher levels of depersonalization led to higher levels of emotional exhaustion and lower levels of personal accomplishment. To our knowledge, the present research is the first to provide reliable longitudinal evidence for the conceptualization of burnout as a developmental process, although the effects are not large enough to be of practical use in the recognition of burnout...|$|R
