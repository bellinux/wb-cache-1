40|$|ELEVEN INTRABONY PERIODONTAL LESIONS in five {{volunteer}} patients received surgical debridcmenl followed hy sile implantation of a porous paniculate polymeric composite i HTR polymer). These {{patients were}} observed over lime periods varying from 4 weeks to 2 d weeks. At the end ol the individual observation periods, treated sites were surgically removed in block for histologic analysis. Clinical observations indicated {{a reduction in}} pocket depth following treatment which consisted of both gingival recession and gain in clinical closure. No untoward effects were observed clinically in any treated patient during the observation periods. Histologic responses varied from gain in <b>closure</b> <b>by</b> epithelial <b>adhesion</b> to new attachment of varying magnitude. Such varied responses were seen within the same patient and between patients. Graft particles were present at sites from 4 weeks to 2 (S weeks after implantation and were surrounded by connective tissue capsules. At the periphery of some particles, limited bone formation was present. The alveolar bed was remodeling, at times surrounding specific particles. In our sample, HTR polymer, therefore, {{appeared to be a}} well tolerated synthetic graft material when im-planted in human intrabony lesions [...] / Periodontol 1990; 61 : 269 - 274...|$|R
40|$|I'Kiin INTRABONY LESIONS [N FOUR PATENTS {{were removed}} en bloc 3 to 8 months after {{periodontal}} flap debridemcnt. At {{the time of}} debridement. {{the position of the}} gingival margin and the most apically located calculus were notched to serve as reference points. All lesions received "Synlhograft" " implants and lesions healed uneventfully. Even though these were severely involved periodontal sites, clinical measurements at time of block removal demonstrated gingival recession (average = 2. 9 mm) and a gain in clinical closure (average = 2. 6 mm). Historically, graft particles were preseni in each specimen. They were walled off by collagen and did noi appear to enhance new attachment nor did they induce an inflammatory infiltrate Thus, they seemed to act as nonirritating fillers. Microscopically, closure of the lesions demonstrated repair with limited evidence of new connective tissue attachment. Histologjc expression of the clinical gain in closure was the result of <b>closure</b> <b>by</b> long epithelial <b>adhesion</b> (long junctional epithelium) and possible linkage of dentinal collagen with gingival fibers at areas of dentinal resorption. These variations in closure were often seen within the same clinical site...|$|R
