40|$|The <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> Gyps coprotheres {{is listed}} as a {{globally}} threatened species, because of threats posed by, inter alia, poisoning, loss of habitat, food shortages, electrocutions and drowning in high-walled farm reservoirs. The <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> has undergone major decline in South Africa, including the Eastern Cape. A detailed investigation into the causes of this decline is vital to ensure {{the survival of the}} species. Since it is known that electrocution on powerlines is a major cause of mortality of the griffons in the Eastern Cape, the study therefore focuses on this factor in this region. More specifically, the overall aim or objective of the study is to investigate, through the application of appropriate GIS techniques, the use of descriptive, empirical, habitat and foraging models to prioritise powerline networks, in the Eastern Cape, for mitigation to prevent electrocution of Cape Griffons Gyps coprotheres. The specific activities associated with the aim of the study are: (1) to identify the broad habitat types used by the griffons, (2) to determine the mean daily foraging range size of the griffons, (3) to map currently active foraging ranges and to categorise them according to their role, and the level of importance, in the foraging and breeding behaviour of the species, (4) to map the locations of networks of griffon-unfriendly powerline networks, and (5) to integrate the outcomes of (1) to (4) above, to produce a spatially explicit product that ranks griffon-unfriendly powerline networks according to their priority level for mitigation. The study uses simple descriptive models to investigate, spatially, the threat posed by griffon-unfriendly powerlines to the <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> in the Eastern Cape. The modelling approach includes a broad level simple habitat model (Categorical model), a Maxent model, a spatial foraging model and an electrocution model. Several map outputs were produced from the analyses. <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> habitat was successfully modelled using ecological input variables: biome, vegetation xvii type (suitable/unsuitable for griffon foraging), stock (cattle, sheep and goats), and stock farming types (commercial & communal). All outputs were modelled {{through the use of a}} Geographical Information System (GIS). Opportunistic sightings data were used for the study, which means that the data were collected on a non-systematic basis and are therefore considered incomplete. In ecology and zoogeography, incomplete datasets are common. To address this issue, a maximum entropy (Maxent) model was applied to the available dataset. Maxent produces predictions or conclusions from incomplete information, and was therefore useful for this study. The mean daily foraging area (coverage) of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> in the study area was estimated from published and unpublished marked bird studies conducted elsewhere, but in generally similar habitats. Based on all the data from these studies, it was considered appropriate to use a circular area, with a radius of 40 km, to represent the mean daily foraging range of the <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> in the Eastern Cape. It was considered appropriate to use a roughly circular area to depict the daily foraging area, given that the <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> qualifies as a central place forager. This means that the griffons are tied to a permanent site (roosting site or breeding site) and forage within a certain area around that central site. The mean daily foraging area (40 km) was applied to the currently active griffon sites: breeding sites, regular roosting sites, seasonal/occasional sites, and roosting sites (uncertain status). This produced four foraging area types, which formed the basis for the creation of two spatial foraging area models: Hierarchical Foraging Area Model (HFAM) and the Intersecting Foraging Area Model (IFAM). The HFAM produced three outputs: Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Foraging Areas. These three areas represent the hierarchical presentation of the relative importance of the four foraging area types. The outcome was areas of different predicted griffon occurrence: ‘high’, ‘medium’, ‘low’. The IFAM is essentially an extension of the HFAM, which represents a single area where foraging ranges based on all four types are intersected. The outcome represents the area of predicted highest griffon occurrence. The identified areas of different predicted griffon occurrence, or density (outputs of the HFAM and IFAM), were individually intersected with the layer that indicates the locations of the ‘unsafe’ powerlines. These intersects are depicted in hierarchical mode and expressed according to a number of four risk categories (very high, high, medium and low). The final spatial output of the study is a map that identifies priority powerlines for mitigation against griffon mortality caused by electrocutions and collisions with powerline infrastructur...|$|E
40|$|Vulture (Accipitridae) poisonings are {{a concern}} in South Africa, with {{hundreds}} of birds dying annually. Although some of these poisonings are accidental, {{there has been an}} increase in the number of intentional baiting of poached rhinoceros (Rhinocerotidae) and elephant (Elephantidae) carcasses to kill vultures that alert officials to poaching sites by circling overhead. The primary chemicals implicated are the organophosphorous and carbamate compounds. Although most poisoning events can be identified by dead vultures surrounding the scavenged carcass, weak birds are occasionally found and brought to rehabilitation centers for treatment. The treating veterinarian needs to make an informed decision on the cause of illness or poisoning prior to treatment. We established the reference interval for serum and plasma cholinesterase activity in the <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> Vulture (Gyps coprotheres) as 591. 58 – 1, 528. 26 U/L, providing a clinical assay for determining potential exposure to cholinesterase-depressing pesticides.

40|$|Diclofenac, a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID), kills vultures (Gyps spp.) that consume tainted carcasses. As a result, vulture {{populations in}} India, Nepal, and Pakistan have been devastated. Studies on meloxicam and ketoprofen {{demonstrated that the}} toxicity of the NSAIDs is unpredictable, thereby necessitating individual testing of all available NSAIDs. Because {{it is no longer}} practical to use vultures for toxicity testing, we evaluated the Pied Crow (Corvus albus) as a model. Pied Crows (n 56) were exposed to a dose of 0. 8 and 10 mg/kg of diclofenac, with no signs of toxicity, and a rapid half-life of elimination. Using primary renal cell and hepatocyte cultures, a high tolerance was demonstrated at the cellular level. Meta-analysis of pharmacokinetic data for the Domestic Chicken (Gallus gallus) and the African White-backed (Gyps africanus), <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> (Gyps coprotheres), and Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura) showed a trend toward toxicity when the half-life of elimination increased. We conclude that the crow is not susceptible to diclofenac and, more important, that toxicity in the Gyps species is probably related to zero-order metabolism.

40|$|In {{a safety}} study, <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> {{vultures}} (Gyps coprotheres) were dosed with ketoprofen at single doses of ~ 1 mg/kg (n = 5) and 5 mg/kg (n = 11). No toxicity {{was reported in}} the 1 mg/kg group, with the AUCinf, V z and Cl being 10. 42 μg/ml h, 0. 37 l/kg and 0. 10 l/h kg, respectively. Toxicity occurred in the 5 mg/kg group, with 7 of the 11 birds dying. Clinical signs of toxicity included depression, loss of appetite and apparent coma. Animals died within 48 h of dosing. The AUCinf, V z and Cl in the birds that survived were 52. 26 μg/ml h, 0. 45 l/kg and 0. 10 l/h kg, respectively. The AUCinf, Vz and Cl in the birds those died were 207. 90 μg/ml h, 0. 26 l/kg and 0. 02 l/h kg, respectively. Based on the increase in the AUCinf and Cmax in the birds that died, we surmise that toxicity resulted from saturation of the metabolic process. While the exact metabolic pathway remains unknown in these vultures, we believe that toxicity may be due to pharmacogenomic differences in the cytochrome P 450 pathway. The study was also approved by Gauteng Nature Conservation (GDACE) in accordance with the National Biodiversity Act. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|SouthAfrica {{is home to}} 9 vulture species, {{of which}} 7 are endangered. While {{the cause of the}} {{population}} declines remains largely speculative, a vast amount of effort has been dedicated towards the protection of populations by ensuring sustainable and safe food sources for the various colonies. Limited focus was placed in the past on efforts related to the rescue and/or rehabilitation (R&amp;R) of injured birds and the release of these birds back into the wild. This paper provides an overview of the causes, the impact and success of 3 organisations involved in R&amp;R efforts of vultures in the Magaliesberg mountain range and surrounding areas over a period of 10 years. Study material included 162 <b>Cape</b> <b>griffon</b> (CGV) and 38 African white-backed (AWBV) vultures.

The R&amp;R data clearly indicate that the major cause of injuries was birds colliding with overhead pylons, as a high number of soft tissue and skeletal injuries were observed.

40|$|Human and {{veterinary}} drug development addresses absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and toxicology (ADMET) of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) {{in the target}} species. Metabolism {{is an important factor}} in controlling circulating plasma and target tissue API concentrations and in generating metabolites which are more easily eliminated in bile, faeces and urine. The essential purpose of xenobiotic metabolism is to convert lipid-soluble, non-polar and non-excretable chemicals into water soluble, polar molecules that are readily excreted. Xenobiotic metabolism is classified into Phase I enzymatic reactions (which add or expose reactive functional groups on xenobiotic molecules), Phase II reactions (resulting in xenobiotic conju-gation with large water-soluble, polar molecules) and Phase III cellular efflux transport processes. The human–fish plasma model provides a useful approach to understanding the pharmacokinetics of APIs (e. g. diclofenac, ibu-profen and propranolol) in freshwater fish, where gill and liver metabolism of APIs have been shown to be of importance. By contrast, wildlife species with low metabolic competency may exhibit zero-order metabolic (pharmacoki-netic) profiles and thus high API toxicity, as in the case of diclofenac and the dramatic decline of vulture populations across the Indian subcontinent. A similar threat looms for African <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> vultures exposed to ketoprofen and meloxicam, recent studies indicating toxicity relates to zero-order metabolism (suggesting P 450 Phase I enzyme system or Phase II glucuronida-tion deficiencies). While all aspects of ADMET are important in toxicity evaluations, these observations demonstrate the importance of methods for predicting API comparative metabolism as a central part of environmental risk assessment.

40|$|Three Gyps vulture {{species are}} {{on the brink of}} {{extinction}} in South Asia owing to the veterinary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac. Carcasses of domesticated ungulates are the main food source for Asia's vultures and birds die from kidney failure after consuming diclofenac-contaminated tissues. Here, we report on the safety testing of the NSAID ketoprofen, which was not reported to cause mortality in clinical treatment of scavenging birds and is rapidly eliminated from livestock tissues. Safety testing was undertaken using captive non-releasable <b>Cape</b> <b>griffon</b> vultures (Gyps coprotheres) and wild-caught African white-backed vultures (G. africanus), both previously identified as susceptible to diclofenac and suitable surrogates. Ketoprofen doses ranged from 0. 5 to 5 mg kg− 1 vulture body weight, based upon recommended veterinary guidelines and maximum levels of exposure for wild vultures (estimated as 1. 54 mg kg− 1). Doses were administered by oral gavage or through feeding tissues from cattle dosed with ketoprofen at 6 mg kg− 1 cattle body weight, before slaughter. Mortalities occurred at dose levels of 1. 5 and 5 mg kg− 1 vulture body weight (within the range recommended for clinical treatment) with the same clinical signs as observed for diclofenac. Surveys of livestock carcasses in India indicate that toxic levels of residual ketoprofen are already present in vulture food supplies. Consequently, we strongly recommend that ketoprofen is not used for veterinary treatment of livestock in Asia and in other regions of the world where vultures access livestock carcasses. The only alternative to diclofenac that should be promoted as safe for vultures is the NSAID meloxicam...|$|E
40|$|The National Zoological Gardens of South Africa (NZG) is {{involved}} in the ex situ conservation of Gyps coprotheres, the <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> vulture (CGV) and houses 24 birds in a 100 -yr-old aviary. Following the death of one vulture with high liver lead concentrations, an investigation was launched to ascertain the source(s) and consequences of lead toxicity in this breeding colony. Whole blood from 24 CGV, paint from the enclosure, water, and soil sampled at various locations within the enclosure were evaluated for their lead concentration, and data were gathered from NZG’s medical records. The lead concentration in the paint, water, and enclosure soil was 5, 100 lg/g, 0. 5 lg/dl, and 72. 48 6 21. 83 lg/g, respectively. The whole-blood lead concentrations were 56. 58 6 11 lg/dl. The breeding history of six pairs within the contaminated enclosure since 2002 showed 45 eggs laid, of which 44 % were infertile and 24 % successfully reared. The medical records revealed evidence of osteodystrophy despite adequate nutrition. As intervention measures, six birds were treated with Ca 2 þEDTA and the topsoil inside the enclosure was replaced. As a result, the lead concentration in the enclosure soil dropped to 14. 74 6 14. 39 lg/g, and the whole-blood lead concentrations declined to 42. 75 6 11. 64 lg/dl. It was concluded that lead concentrations in whole blood in excess of 100 lg/dl leads to clinical signs of lead toxicity in the CGV. Lower levels appear to interfere mainly with reproductive potential. This project was funded by in part by the WWF South Africa and the Ernest Oppenheimer and Son Trust. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Seven of {{the nine}} vulture species in South Africa are listed as {{endangered}} on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. From these, the <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> vulture (Gyps corprotheres) is the most endangered species in the region. Although inadequate nutritional support has been blamed on the constant decline in populations, the process of vulture restaurants has failed to improve the population status over the last twenty years. One possible reason for the decline may be an underlying reproductive disorder as described in endocrine disruptive syndromes. Both DDT and p,p 0 -DDE have been detected previously at very high concentrations in the mid 1980 s, with lower concentrations still being detectable as late as 2001. To establish the effect of DDT and DDE, the vulture estrogen receptor a (ERa) was sequenced from two species using 50 and 30 rapid amplification cDNA ends (RACE). Using transient transfected mammalian cell assays, vulture ERa estrogen-dependent transcription activity was validated using various estrogens and DDT derivatives. The receptor assay was sensitive to p,p 0 -DDT, o,p 0 -DDT and p,p 0 -DDE with EC 50 of 2. 41 x 10 - 6, 3. 47 x 10 - 7 and 3. 81 x 10 - 5 M. When compared to results obtained from human, zebrafish, chicken, salamander and turtle, the vulture ERa showed high sensitivity to o,p 0 -DDT and intermediately responsive to p,p 0 -DDE. Vulture ERa is, however, not responsive to the DDT and DDE levels reported in the plasma of vultures from the last population survey, indicating that the Southern African vulture are not currently exposed to disruptive levels of these contaminants...|$|E
40|$|D. Phil. The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the population genetic structure of African Whitebacked Vultures (Pseudogyps africanus) and to compare values to those previously documented for the <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> Vulture (Gyps coprotheres). The percentage of polymorphic. loci (P = 34. 15 %, 0. 99 criterion) and average heterozygosity (17 = 0. 108, ± 0. 032) calculated for P. africanus, confirm low levels of genetic -variation as reported for G. coprotheres. Blood samples' obtained from Lappetfaced (Torgos, tracheliotos) and Egyptian (Neophron percnopterus) Vultures enabled an evaluation of the genetic differentiation among the four southern African vulture species from allele frequency data assessed at 19 presumptive gene loci. Six (31. 58 %) of the 19 shared loci were polymorphic. Values of 1. 26 (10. 1), 26. 32 % and 0. 076 (± 0. 047) for P. 'africanus, 1. 21 (± 0. 1), 21. 05 % and 0. 097 (± 0. 045) for T. tracheliotos, 1. 11 (± 0. 7), 21. 05 %. and 0. 053. (± 0. 053) for N: percnopterus and 1. 05 (± 0. 5), 5. 26 % and 0. 044 (± 0. 047) for G. coprotheres were obtained for the mean number of alleles per locus, P and Ti respectively. An average between-population fixigion index (FsT) value of 0. 322 was obtained, which is indicative of significant (P < 0. 01) differentiation between the four accipitrid species studied. Reference values for some haematological and plasma chemical parameters were established in 33 apparently normal, free-living, African Whitebacked Vulture nestlings. This. information can be. used in future ornithological research. A total of 27 variables. were examined, which include: leucocyte and erythrocyte counts, haemoglobin concentration,. haematocrit, haematimetric indices, glucose, creatinine, urea, total prOtein, albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, cholesterol, total lipids, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, cholinesterase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, chloride, potassium, sodium and osmolarity. Only five parameters exhibited statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences between the two populations assayed. The Sandveld population showed elevated mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration and alkaline phosphatase levels relative to the Dronfield population, whereas, the latter group displayed higher erythrocyte counts and potassium and sodium values than birds from the Sandveld community. Gaschromatography was used to establish the presence of quantifiable. residues. of 14 persistent chlorinated hydrocarbon pollutants in whole blood, clotted blood, heart, kidney, liver, bone, fat and muscle samples obtained from individual African Whitebacked, <b>Cape.</b> <b>Griffon</b> and Lappetfaced Vultures from different localities in South Africa. Concentrations of seven essential elements (Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) and four toxic metals (Al, Ni, Pb and Sr) were, furthermore, measured. The levels of pollutants measured in whole blood samples of live specimens were compared between nestlings from two natural breeding colonies, adults from a wildlife area and birds held in captivity. Statistically significant differences between populations were detected in geometric means calculated for y-BHC, a-chlordane and a-endosulfan. Five of the organochlorine contaminants displayed significant variations between concentrations detected in the clotted blood, organs and muscles excised from vulture carcasses. This includes residues ofy-BHC, a-chlordane, dieldrin,, 8 -endosulfan and heptachlor epoxide. Values of the respective organochlorines obtained in vulture samples were generally low in comparison to results documented for a number of avian species. Levels of the, majority of metals analysed differed significantly- between two or more of the sampling localities, between adults and nestlings, and between captive and wild individuals. Metals which did not occur in such distinctly defining concentrations were Sr, Cu and Fe. Birds from Moholoholo maintained the highest overall blood metal burden, while nestlings from Dronfield were the least contaminated Significant differences were present between two or more tissues types for all the metals. The predominant sites for metal accumulation in vultures were the fatty tissues and bones. Most of the levels of metals measured in vultures compared well with concentrations reported for other avian species, and were generally within the range documented for species devoid of deleterious symptoms induced from heavy metal poisoning. However; certain individuals exhibited potentially toxic concentrations of specific metals such as Cu, Fe, Ni, and Pb. Continual monitoring of breeding colonies is recommended. The suitability of African Whitebacked Vulture nestlings as basic bioindicatori is highly advocated. The genetic data from this study can be used to compare levels of genetic diversity remaining in captive and wild vulture populations. An assessment of the amount and pattern of genetic variation of current populations of vulture species is an essential step towards ensuring the longterm survival of these birds. The phylogenetic conclusions found in. this study through allozyme electrophoresis correspond to results obtained from nucleotide sequence studies of the mitochondrial cytochrome b. gene. This points to an extent of positive corroboration between the two techniques. The haematological profile established for African Whitebacked Vulture nestlings constitutes a set of reference values that was previously unavailable for southern African vulture species. This data can assist in diagnosing and monitoring pathological and clinical' incidents detected in vultures. Values for a number of organochlo?ine pesticides and heavy metals, which have not been analysed in vulture species in the past, are documented. These values can serve as guidelines for future research, as well as control values for monitoring the occurrence and distribution of these contaminants within the habitats of vulture species. This study, therefore, presents information for research fields directly related to the survival of vulture populations. These factors must be included in future vulture management and reintroduction programmes as they will serve to enhance the success of conservation attempts...|$|E
40|$|Diclofenac has {{previously}} {{been shown to be}} toxic in three species of Gyps vultures (G. bengalensis, G. tenuirostris, and G. indicus) on the Indian subcontinent. Due to the devastating effect on the population of vultures (> 99. 9 % species mortality), numerous efforts were initiated {{in order to protect the}} species. One such effort involved the removal of further threats to the species. At present the major threat identified has been the other non-steroidal drugs (NSAIDs) available for veterinary use. From research on ketoprofen and meloxicam (the former toxic and the latter safe), it was evident that toxicity was not general for the class of NSAIDs and that other factors played a role in toxicity. This unfortunately meant that each drug had to be tested individually in the vulture. While possible, the endangered status of vulture globally makes this approach unethical. As a result an alternate method of testing needed to be validated or sought. It was believed that a surrogate model could be the answer. The aim of this study was to establish if the crow could serve as such a surrogate model. The toxic effect of diclofenac in crows (n= 6) was evaluated in a two cross over studies at doses of 0. 8 and 10 mg/kg. No signs of toxicity were evident during the period of clinical monitoring, or necropsy or clinical pathology. In addition the drug was barely detectable in the birds and was described by a half-life of elimination of approximately 2. 5 hours. To better explain the absence of observable toxicity, a follow-up study was initiated using freshly harvested renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cells and hepatocytes in a cell culture assay previously validated for cytotoxicity and reactive-oxidative generation. In general, the in vitro study results showed the hepatocytes and RTE cells to be tolerant to the presence of diclofenac, with cell viability remaining in the region of 80 %. In contrast meloxicam appeared to be more toxic as previously seen with chicken primary RTE cells. Based on the in vivo and in vitro culture results, it was speculated that the absence of toxicity in the crow was due to a combination of rapid half-life of metabolism in combination with low susceptibility of the cells to toxicity. To further explain the role of metabolism in toxicity, meta-analysis of pharmacokinetic data for the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus</i.), African White-backed (Gyps africanus), <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> (Gyps coprotheres) and Turkey vultures (<i<Cathartes aura) were evaluated for trends in toxicity. The data clearly showed a trend toward toxicity when the half-life of elimination increased. It was therefore concluded that toxicity in Gyps species is probably related to zero-order metabolism, and therefore cannot be predicted by a surrogate model due to inter-species differences in metabolism. The crow is therefore not a surrogate model for toxicity testing in the place of the vulture. CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012. Paraclinical Sciencesunrestricte...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, three species of Gyps {{vultures}} on the Asian subcontinent have declined dramatically in population numbers, some {{as much as}} 97 to 99 %. Although the initial cause {{was believed to be}} infectious, it was later shown to be due to an inadvertent exposure to diclofenac via the food chain. In order to protect the remaining wild vultures, diclofenac needed to be removed from the food chain. Unfortunately the Indian government was reluctant to ban diclofenac until an alternate veterinary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was both safe in vultures and effective in cattle could be identified. Although meloxicam was tentatively identified as this drug, toxicity testing still needed to be undertaken. Using a previously validated model, two studies were undertaken to determine the acute toxic effect of diclofenac in vulture as well as to ascertain if the drug had the potential to accumulate. In the first study, meloxicam in formulation was shown to be safe as a single oral dose up to 2 mg/kg in African White Backed-Vultures (Gyps africanus). To further demonstrate the safety of food borne meloxicam, vultures were exposed to meat rich in meloxicam residues, with once again no signs of toxicity being evident. In the second study the drugs ability to accumulate was evaluated pharmacokinetically in <b>Cape</b> <b>Griffon</b> Vultures (Gyps corprotheres). From this study meloxicam was shown to have a very short half-life of elimination, making it unlikely that the drug could be a cumulative toxin. This was subsequently confirmed clinically by the absence of toxicity in birds receiving repeated doses of meloxicam. Although meloxicam was shown to be adequately safe, the safety of other veterinary NSAIDs still required elucidation. While further testing in vultures would have been possible, the small population size of the various vulture species made this unethical. Therefore a surrogate species needed to be identified. With the domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus) being commonly available, attempts were made to validate the chicken as a model. Although the dosed chickens did show similar toxicity patterns from clinical pathology to histopathology, a major problem was their higher tolerance making it impossible to use them as a surrogate. It was, however, concluded that the domestic chicken may be used in mechanistic studies in an attempt to establish an in vitro model. From the mechanistic studies both diclofenac and meloxicam were directly toxic to chicken and vulture renal tubular epithelial cells following 48 h of incubation. It was later shown that this toxicity was associated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could be temporarily ameliorated by pre-incubation with uric acid due to its anti-oxidant activity. When cultures were incubated with either drug for only two hours, meloxicam showed no toxicity in contrast to the cellular toxicity present for diclofenac. In both cases no increase in ROS production was evident. In addition diclofenac influenced the excretion of uric acid by interfering with p-amino-hippuric acid channels. The effect on uric acid excretion persisted after the removal of the diclofenac. It was therefore concluded that vulture susceptibility to diclofenac results from a combination of an increase in cellular ROS, a depletion of intracellular uric acid concentration and most importantly the drug’s long half-life in the vulture. Unfortunately the importance of the drug’s half-life in the toxicodynamics makes it unlikely that in vitro testing will be possible.

40|$|In the 1990 s, {{diclofenac}} {{was responsible}} for the inadvertent deaths of over ten million vultures on the Asian subcontinent. While the pathology associated with their deaths was clearly evident as visceral and articular gout, the mechanism behind their death remains an enigma. In one of the supposition proposed on a potential mechanism of toxicity, it was postulated that the acute necrosis of the proximal convoluted tubules was caused by ischaemia. More specifically, toxicity was related to the avian renal vascular anatomy, whereby a renal portal blood supply exists viz. venous blood originating from the hind-quarters co-perfuses the kidney with arterial blood from the aorta. A further uniqueness of this system, is the presence of the renal portal valve in the v. iliaca communis, which appears to control the shunting of venous blood from the hind limbs to the vena cava, thereby bypassing the cranial renal lobe in times of stress. In the theory put forward, it was suggested that the valve could be under prostaglandin control and that diclofenac (a potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor) would potentially induce a change in the valve functionality with the net effect being the shunting of blood away from the cranial renal lobe resulting in hypoperfusion, ischaemia and necrosis of this lobe. While the theory appears plausible, the valva renalis portalis has only been described in a small number of other bird species such as the chicken (Gallus domesticus) and ostrich (Struthio camelus), which actually has six valvae renales (de Carvalho, et al. 2007). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the renal anatomy and related vasculature of the <b>Cape</b> <b>griffon</b> vulture (Gyps coprotheres) (CGV), which is senstive to the toxic effects of diclofenac. Special attention is also being given to comparisons with the anatomy of the domestic chicken. This study made use of 13 CGVs. Six specimens were freshly perfused with formalin within minutes of being euthansed. In all cases, the birds were euthanised on the recommendation of the treating veterinarian due severe orthopaedic injuries. The birds were otherwise deemed to be healthy. For the histological portion of the study, evaluations were made of both stored samples in the bank at the Section of veterinary pathology of the University of Pretoria, while renal and associated vascular tissue from two of the freshly fixed birds were prepared using standard H&E techniques. The other seven were recovered dead in the field. Of these four were prepared for skeletal evaluation, and the remainder used for vascular casting. The kidneys of the CGV were present within the fossae renales and were well attached to the synsacrum and the ilium, and was trilobular. While this was similar to the chicken, the divisions with their connective tissue capsule in the vulture was much more prominent than in the chicken. The vasculature was also almost identical to the domestic chicken, with the only differences being at the entrance of the v. portalis renalis caudalis and the exit of the v. renalis caudalis into the v. iliaca communis on the right. The valva renalis portalis was also present in same location described in the chicken with a similar appearance viz. the valve was present in the v. iliaca communis between the v. renalis caudalis and the v. renalis cranialis and appeared as conical shaped, with finger-like processes. Histologically, the CGV kidney was similar to that to other avian spp, with reptilian, mammalian and intermediate nephrons being evident. The kidney also had the expected appearance with the cortex consisting of the glomeruli and the medulla being made up of medullary cones. On cross-section the renal portal valve was composed of smooth muscle finger-like projections that protruded into the lumen of the lumen of the v. iliaca communis. The valve was well vascularised and was associated with a nerve plexus. While the plexus could not be conclusively associated with the valve, the renal portal valve is the only intravascular smooth muscle structure that has been described to have sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. Based on the findings of this study, the proposed mechanism of toxicity of diclofenac is anatomically possible. The similarity of the chicken and vulture in their anatomical structure may also explain previous finding that the chicken could serve as a physiological model of the study of the pathophysiology of diclofenac s toxicity.
