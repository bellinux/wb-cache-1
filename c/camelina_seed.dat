40|$|Health {{care systems}} and health related {{studies in the}} western world have focused on “development-driven” {{diseases}} for the past several decades. To tackle these health issues, results from both basic and applied research have recommended nutritional therapy and physical exercise as effective and widely accepted interventions. The demand for omega- 3 fatty acids has been increasing due to their many health benefits. Nonetheless, other sources than the most used marine oils are needed to increase sustainability and prevent heavy metals intake. A potential sustainable source of omega- 3 fatty acids is the underutilized <b>camelina</b> <b>seed.</b> Therefore, the goal of this research was to extract and characterize the lipids in <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> using a green extraction method, and to utilize the oil and its lecithin. ^ Extraction of omega- 3 rich <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> oil by conventional methods is challenging due to oxidation. Additionally, concerns regarding organic solvent based extractions are increasing because of their immediate danger in handling and the potential long-term health problems. Thus, interest in supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) as a green technology to extract bioactive rich oils, such as <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> oil, has been rising. This research thus consisted of initially optimizing SC-CO 2 and ethanol-modified SC-CO 2 extraction conditions, and examining their advantages as compared to traditional methods. Extraction using pure SC-CO 2 allowed oil recovery of 88 % relative to hexane extraction, whereas ethanol modified SC-CO 2 resulted in an oil yield that was comparable to hexane extraction. In addition, using ethanol as a modifier increased the polar fraction of the oil. A study on the oxidation of <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> oil extracted using different techniques demonstrated that modifying SC-CO 2 with 10 % (w/w) ethanol resulted in the highest stability. Subsequently, stable <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> oil emulsions were formed to improve delivery of the omega- 3 fatty acids and results revealed that emulsions fabricated at 30 MPa and a higher number of passes resulted in smaller particle sizes and higher physical and oxidative stability. Lastly, the chemical composition and emulsifying property of enzymatically degummed lecithin recovered from <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> oil was studied and demonstrated that the lecithin was rich in phosphatidylinositol (PI) and lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) and had good emulsifying potential. ...|$|E
40|$|With {{its high}} seed oil content, the mustard family plant Camelina sativa has gained {{attention}} {{as a potential}} biofuel source. As a bioenergy crop, camelina has many advantages. It grows on marginal land with low demand for water and fertilizer, has a relatively short life cycle, and is stress tolerant. As most other crop seed oils, <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> triacylglycerols (TAGs) consist of mostly long, unsaturated fatty acyl moieties, which is not desirable for biofuel processing. In our efforts to produce shorter, saturated chain fatty acyl moieties in <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> oil for conversion to jet fuel, a 12 : 0 -acyl-carrier thioesterase gene, UcFATB 1, from California bay (Umbellularia californica Nutt.) was expressed in camelina seeds. Up to 40 % of short chain laurate (C 12 : 0) and myristate (C 14 : 0) were present in TAGs of the seed oil of the transgenics. The total oil content and germination rate of the transgenic seeds were not affected. Analysis of positions of these two fatty acyl moieties in TAGs {{indicated that they were}} present at the sn- 1 and sn- 3 positions, but not sn- 2, on the TAGs. Suppression of the camelina KASII genes by RNAi constructs led to higher accumulation of palmitate (C 16 : 0), from 7. 5 % up to 28. 5 %, and further reduction of longer, unsaturated fatty acids in seed TAGs. Co-transformation of camelina with both constructs resulted in enhanced accumulation of all three medium-chain, saturated fatty acids in <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> oils. Our results show that a California bay gene can be successfully used to modify the oil composition in <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> and present a new biological alternative for jet fuel production...|$|E

The experiment was conducted on 600 Hybro PN broilers during the age period 7 – 42 days. The broilers were assigned to 3 groups, a control group © and two experimental groups (E 1 and E 2), each with 200 broilers (3 groups  3 replicates  100 broilers). Three (phase-feeding) compound feeds formulations were used. The control diet consisted mainly of corn, full fat soybean, soybean meal and corn gluten. <b>Camelina</b> <b>seeds</b> (10 %) replaced full fat soybean in the experimental groups, while additionally, in E 2 the classical premix with synthetic vitamins and minerals was replaced by buckthorn meal.

In the present study, an orthogonal array design was used to optimize the biodiesel production from <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> oil using ultrasonic-assisted transesterification. Four relevant factors are investigated: methanol to oil ratio, catalyst concentration, reaction time and temperature to obtain maximum fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) yield of biodiesel. An OA 25 matrix was employed to study {{the effect of the}} four factors, by which the effect of each factor was estimated using statistical analysis. Based on the results of the statistical analysis after the orthogonal experiments, maximal biodiesel FAME yield (98. 6 %) was obtained under the conditions of 8 : 1 methanol to oil molar ratio, 1. 25 wt. % catalyst concentration (KOH), 50 min reaction time, and 55 ℃ reaction temperature.

40|$|Seed oils of many Cuphea sp. contain. 90 % of medium-chain fatty acids, such as {{decanoic acid}} (10 : 0). These seed oils, which {{are among the}} most compositionally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from {{specialized}} fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain fatty acids in the sn- 2 and sn- 3 positions of seed triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT 1 -type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT 1, from the transcriptome of C. avigera var pulcherrima developing seeds. Microsomes of camelina (Camelina sativa) seeds engineered for CpuDGAT 1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10 : 0 -CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4 -fold higher than that in <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> microsomes lacking CpuDGAT 1. In addition, coexpression in camelina seeds of CpuDGAT 1 with a C. viscosissima FatB thioesterase (CvFatB 1) that generates 10 : 0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10 : 0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT 1 and CvFatB 1 with the previously described CvLPAT 2, a 10 : 0 -CoA-specific Cuphea LPAT, increased 10 : 0 amounts to 25 mol % in <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10 : 0 in the sn- 2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB 1 and CvLPAT 2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10 : 0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these seeds. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10 : 0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to generate 10 : 0 -rich seed oils...|$|E

L) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; 2. 36. 1. 0. 18. g, 30 fish/tank) were fed one of five diets containing solvent-extracted camelina meal (SECM) at dietary inclusion levels of 0, 50, 100, 150 or 200. g/kg. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of fish fed 200. g/kg SECM were significantly lower than those fed 0 and 50. g/kg SECM. The protein efficiency ratio (PER) of fish fed 50. g/kg SECM (2. 4) was significantly higher than fish fed 0, 150 and 200. g/kg SECM (all 2. 1). There were no significant differences among treatments for total feed consumption or FCR, although during earlier periods of the trial, fish fed 150 and 200. g/kg SECM had higher FCR than fish fed 0 and 50. g/kg SECM (P. 0. 05). Although there were a few negative effects on performance in fish fed 200. g/kg <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> and HORM early in the trial, this did not remain consistent for the entire trial. The maximum dietary inclusion threshold of these camelina products in juvenile rainbow trout diets is likely between 100 and 200. g/kg, although further research will be required to determine more definite values.

Especially {{the role of}} bacteria, archaea, fungi and protozoa in mediating the lipid effects is unclear. In the present in vitro study, archaea, fungi and protozoa were selectively inhibited by specific agents. This was fully or almost fully successful for fungi and protozoa as well as archaeal activity {{as determined by the}} methyl-coenzyme M reductase alpha subunit gene. Five different microbial treatments were generated: rumen fluid being intact (I), without archaea (-A), without fungi (-F), without protozoa (-P) and with bacteria only (-AFP). A forage-concentrate diet given alone or supplemented with crushed full-fat oilseeds of either safflower (Carthamus tinctorius) or poppy (Papaver somniferum) or camelina (Camelina sativa) at 70 g oil kg- 1 diet dry matter was incubated. This added up to 20 treatments with six incubation runs per treatment. All oilseeds suppressed methane emission compared to the non-supplemented control. Compared to the non-supplemented control, -F decreased organic matter (OM) degradation, and short-chain fatty acid concentration was greater with <b>camelina</b> and safflower <b>seeds.</b> Methane suppression per OM digested in -F was greater with <b>camelina</b> <b>seeds</b> (- 12 vs. - 7 % with I, P = 0. 06), but smaller with poppy seeds (- 4 vs. - 8 % with I, P = 0. 03), and not affected with safflower <b>seeds.</b> With -P, <b>camelina</b> <b>seeds</b> decreased the acetate-to-propionate ratio and enhanced the methane suppression per gram dry matter (18 vs. 10 % with I, P = 0. 08). Hydrogen recovery was improved with -P in any oilseeds compared to non-supplemented control. No methane emission was detected with the -A and -AFP treatments. In conclusion, concerning methanogenesis, <b>camelina</b> <b>seeds</b> seem to exert effects only on archaea and bacteria. By contrast, with safflower and poppy seeds methane was obviously reduced mainly through the interaction with protozoa or archaea associated with protozoa. This demonstrated that the microbial groups differ in their contribution to the methane suppressing effect dependent on the source of lipid. These findings help to understand how lipid supplementation and microbial groups interact, and thus may assist in making this methane mitigation tool more efficient, but await confirmation in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Fossil fuels {{have been}} {{the main source of}} energy for a long period but due to growing {{concerns}} over climate change, oil depletion and energy security, the development of renewable sources of energy such as biofuels have been flourishing over the past few decades. Despite the fact that biofuels are perceived to be more sustainable than fossil fuels, three important issues should be considered if agricultural products are used to produce fuel. First, the environmental impacts of producing biofuels vary greatly with feedstock type and growing location. The second issue is the dilemma between food and fuel such that if food crops are used to make biofuels, food prices can increase dramatically. Third, if there is an increase in demand for a particular crop, non-agricultural land (e. g. forest, grassland, peatland) can be converted to agricultural land which increases the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) due to land use change (LUC). In order to capture the effect of regional factors on life cycle assessment of biofuels, agroecosystem process-based models which can model soil emissions and predict yield can be used. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a systematic set of procedures for compiling and examining the inputs and outputs of materials and energy and the associated environmental impacts directly attributable to the functioning of a product or service system throughout its life cycle. In the first objective of this study, the effect of regional factors on LCA of <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> production and camelina methyl ester production was assessed. While general conclusions from LCA studies point to lower environmental impacts of biofuels, it has been shown in many studies that the environmental impacts are dependent on location, production practices and even local weather variations. A cradle to farm gate and well to pump approaches were used to conduct the LCA. To demonstrate the impact of agro-climatic and management factors (weather condition, soil characteristics, and management practices) on the overall emissions for four different regions including Corvallis, OR, Pendleton, OR, Pullman, WA and Sheridan, WY, field emissions were simulated using the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model. openLCA v. 1. 4. 2 software was used to quantify the environmental impacts of <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> and camelina methyl ester production. The results showed that GHG emissions during camelina production in different regions vary between 49. 39 to 472. 51 kg CO 2 -eq. /ha due to differences in agro-climatic and weather variations.

This paper describes an optimization study on the production of biodiesel from <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> oil using alkaline transesterification. The optimization was based on sixteen well-planned orthogonal experiments (OA 16 matrix). Four main process conditions in the transesterification reaction for obtaining the maximum biodiesel production yield (i. e. methanol quantity, reaction time, reaction temperature and catalyst concentration) were investigated. It was found that the order of significant factors for biodiesel production is catalyst concentration>reaction time>reaction temperature>methanol to oil ratio. Based on the results of the range analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA), the maximum biodiesel yield was found at a molar ratio of methanol to oil of 8 : 1, a reaction time of 70 min, a reaction temperature of 50 °C, and a catalyst concentration of 1 wt. %. The product and FAME yields of biodiesel under optimal conditions reached 95. 8 % and 98. 4 %, respectively.

40|$|Camelina (Camelina sativa), a Brassicaceae oilseed, has {{received}} recent interest as a biofuel crop and production platform for industrial oils. Limiting wider production of camelina for these uses {{is the need}} to improve the quality and content of the seed protein-rich meal and oil, which is enriched in oxidatively unstable polyunsaturated fatty acids that are deleterious for biodiesel. To identify candidate genes for meal and oil quality improvement, a transcriptome reference was built from 2047 Sanger ESTs and more than 2 million 454 -derived sequence reads, representing genes expressed in developing camelina seeds. The transcriptome of approximately 60 K transcripts from 22 597 putative genes includes camelina homologues of nearly all known seedexpressed genes, suggesting a high level of completeness and usefulness of the reference. These sequences included candidates for 12 S (cruciferins) and 2 S (napins) seed storage proteins (SSPs) and nearly all known lipid genes, which have been compiled into an accessible database. To demonstrate the utility of the transcriptome for seed quality modification, seed-specific RNAi lines deficient in napins were generated by targeting 2 S SSP genes, and high oleic acid oil lines were obtained by targeting FATTY ACID DESATURASE 2 (FAD 2) and FATTY ACID ELONGASE 1 (FAE 1). The high sequence identity between Arabidopsis thaliana and camelina genes was also exploited to engineer high oleic lines by RNAi with Arabidopsis FAD 2 and FAE 1 sequences.

Moderate heat stress occurs when temperatures exceed the optimum, inhibiting photosynthesis and decreasing productivity. In the present study, the temperature response of photosynthesis {{and the potential for}} heat acclimation was evaluated for Camelina sativa, a bioenergy crop. The temperature optimum of net CO 2 assimilation rate (A) under atmospheric conditions was 30 - 32 °C and was only slightly higher under non-photorespiratory conditions. The activation state of Rubisco was closely correlated with A at supra-optimal temperatures, exhibiting a parallel decrease with increasing leaf temperature. At both control and elevated temperatures, the modeled response of A to intercellular CO 2 concentration was consistent with Rubisco limiting A at ambient CO 2. Rubisco activation and photochemical activities were affected by moderate heat stress at lower temperatures in camelina than in the warm-adapted species cotton and tobacco. Growth under conditions that imposed a daily interval of moderate heat stress caused a 63 % reduction in <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> yield. Levels of cpn 60 protein were elevated under the higher growth temperature, but acclimation of photosynthesis was minimal. Inactivation of Rubisco in camelina at temperatures above 35 °C was consistent with the temperature response of Rubisco activase activity and indicated that Rubisco activase was a prime target of inhibition by moderate heat stress in camelina.

The following characteristics in <b>Camelina</b> sativa <b>seeds</b> oil were determined. The refractive index was 1. 4774 at 20 °C, the peroxide value of fresh oil was 0. 03 meq H 2 O 2 /kg, saponification value 185. 8 mg KOH/g, iodine value 143. 33 g J 2 and acidic value 6. 27 mg KOH /g. Carotenoid was determined as 16. 77 mg %, by spectrometry in <b>Camelina</b> sativa <b>seeds</b> oil. The analysis of fatty acids composition showed that there are 12. 5 % saturated and 87. 5 % unsaturated fatty acids.

40|$|Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz, (Brassicaceae), {{commonly}} known as false flax, leindotter and gold of pleasure, is a fall or spring planted annual oilcrop species (Putman et al. 1993). This versatile crop has been cultivated in Europe since the Bronze Age. <b>Camelina</b> <b>seed</b> {{was found in the}} stomach of Tollund man, a 4 th century bce mummy recovered from a peat bog in Denmark (Glob 1969). Anthropologists postulate that the man’s last meal had been a soup made from vegetables and seeds including barley, linseed, camelina, knotweed, bristle grass, and chamomile. The Romans used camelina oil as massage oil, lamp fuel, and cooking oil, as well as the meal for food or feed. Camelina, like many Brassicaceae, germinates and emerges in the early spring, well before most cereal grains. Early emergence has several advantages for dryland production including efficient utiliza-tion of spring moisture and competitiveness with common weeds. In response to the resurgent interest in oil crops for sustainable biofuel production, the Montana State Uni-versity (MSU) Agricultural Research Centers have conducted a multi-year, multi-specie oilseed trial. This trial included nine different oilseed crops (sunflower, safflower, soybean, rapeseed, mustard, flax, crambe, canola, and camelina). Camelina sativa emerged from this trial as a promising oilseed crop for production across Montana and the Northern Great Plains. Evaluation parameters included input costs, production costs, harvest costs, and yield. Camelina sativa was not always the highest yielding oilseed crop but it was the most economical crop to produce due to minimal input requirements. GREAT NORTHERN GROWER COOPERATIVE MSU worked with Montana Producers to establish a grower cooperative to produce, process, and distribute camelina. As a result of this collaboration camelina production in Montana rapidly escalated from 0 commercia...|$|E

The potential to use camelina (Camelina sativa L.) as a bioenergy crop has increased {{the need to develop}} management practices that would improve sustainable production. This study evaluated the effects by cultivars (Blaine Creek, Pronghorn, and Shoshone) and three spring seeding dates on the performance of camelina grown under rain-fed conditions in northern Wyoming. Results showed significant effects of cultivar and/or seeding dates on camelina establishment, phenology, yield, seed protein, oil content, and estimated biodiesel yield. Growing degree-day (GDD) requirements for plant emergence, flowering, and maturity were 34, 417, and 998, respectively. Among the three cultivars studied, Blaine Creek and Pronghorn had better establishment and subsequent seed yield in both years. Averaged across the 2 yr, seed yield of Blaine Creek and Pronghorn were 931 and 963 kg ha⁻¹, respectively, greater than that of Shoshone (826 kg ha⁻¹). Seeding date had no effect on seed yield in 2013. However, in 2014, early seeding increased <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> yield. Early seeding in 2014 resulted in a general increase in plant height, harvest index, protein yield, oil content, and estimated biodiesel yield, but reduced protein content. Our findings showed seeding camelina early resulted in good plant establishment, increased seed yield, oil content, and the estimated biodiesel yield. Nonetheless, early seeding could be restrained by wet field conditions prevalent in the spring in most regions of the Great Plains. Hard frost can also be problematic for young spring camelina seedlings...|$|E
40|$|Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz is a promising, biodiesel-producing oilseed {{that could}} {{potentially}} be implemented as a low-input alternative crop for production in the arid southwestern USA.

Camelina experiments were conducted for 2 years (January to May in 2008 and 2010) in Maricopa, Arizona, {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} previously developed heat unit and remote sensing basal crop coefficient (Kcb) methods for predicting camelina crop evapotranspiration (ET) and irrigation scheduling. Besides Kcb methods, additional treatment factors included two different irrigation scheduling soil water depletion (SWD) levels (45 and 65 %) and two levels of seasonal N applications within a randomized complete block design with 4 blocks. Soil water content measurements taken in all treatment plots and applied in soil water balance calculations were used to evaluate the predicted ET. The heat-unit Kcb method was updated and validated during the second experiment to predict ET to within 12 – 13 % of the ET calculated by the soil water balance. The remote sensing Kcb method predicted ET within 7 – 10 % of the soil water balance. Seasonal ET from the soil water balance was significantly greater for the remote sensing than heat-unit Kcb method and significantly greater for the 45 than 65 % SWD level. However, final seed yield means, which varied from 1, 500 to 1, 640 kg ha- 1 for treatments, were not significantly different between treatments or years. Seed oil contents averaged 45 % in both years. Seed yield was found to be linearly related to seasonal ET with maximum yield occurring at about 470 – 490 mm of seasonal ET.

The lipid content of the oilseed of a novel transgenic, DHA-producing land plant, Camelina sativa, containing microalgal genes able to produce LC omega- 3 oils, contained 36 % lipid by weight with triacylglycerols (TAG) as the major lipid class in hexane extracts (96 % of total lipid). Subsequent chloroform-methanol (CM) extraction recovered further lipid (~ 50 % polar lipid, comprising glycolipids and phospholipids) and residual TAG. The main phospholipid species were phosphatidyl choline and phosphatidyl ethanolamine. The % DHA was: 6. 8 % (of total fatty acids) in the TAG-rich hexane extract and 4. 2 % in the polar lipid-rich CM extract. The relative level of ALA (α-linolenic acid, 18 : 3 ω 3) in DHA-camelina seed was higher than the control.

The objectives of the following study were to characterize the production potential of camelina in two environments of central (Pisa, Tuscany) and northern (Bologna, Emilia Romagna) Italy, traditionally devoted to cereal and sunflower cultivation. Results showed that seed and oil yield were higher in Pisa than in Bologna. This was probably due to differences in the sowing dates. In fact, previous experiments showed that winter sown camelina can be damaged by frost in the initial vegetative growth stages. The harvest index found in Pisa was significantly higher than in Bologna due to the lower dry matter accumulation in the vegetative tissues in spring sown crops during the 2 nd and 3 rd year of field trial. Very high amounts of GLs were found, with significant variation among years and environments; the values reached in both environments were among the highest between those found in the literature. This study highlights the good crop adaptability, seed and oil yield, protein and GL content of camellia under the pedo-climatic conditions of central and northern Italy, evidencing a clear effect of location and climate on seed yield and its quality.

40|$|With {{increased}} {{emphasis on}} bio-diesel fuels, the influence of spring planting on development of brown mustard (Brassica juncea cv. Arid), canola (B. napus cv. Hyola 401) and camelina (Camelina sativa cv. Boa) has become important. Field trials were conducted at Scottsbluff, NE, in 2005 and 2006 at planting dates of 24 February, 24 March, 7 April, 21 April and 5 May, and 3 March, 3 April, 10 April, 27 April, 11 May, and 2 Jun, respectively. Emergence time was shorter with later planting. Flowering date was later with later planting but occurred within a range of degree days (P-days). Fruiting was affected by date and P-days, but seed maturity was not affected by planting date and was unrelated to P-days. Fleabeetle (Phyllotreta spp.) damage was very high in brown mustard and canola. Bird, primarily house finch (Carppodacus mexicanus), feeding was a major problem with brown mustard planted before mid April and in canola, only with the first planting. Camelina was not affected by either. Planting in April gave the best yields, and canola could yield over 2200 kg ha− 1. Oil content of the Brassica was highest when planted from late March and later. For camelina, planting date had no effect. In brown mustard and canola, 60 – 65 % of oil was C 18 : 1, in camelina, about 15 %. Later planting increased C 18 : 1 content for the three crops. The second fatty acid was C 18 : 2 with 20 % in brown mustard, 18 % in canola and 20 % in camelina. Later planting increased C 18 : 2 in camelina only. The major fatty acid in camelina was C 18 : 3 at 32 – 37 %; earlier planting increased the content of C 18 : 3. In Camelina, C 20 : 1 comprised about 12 % of the oil and was highest with April planting.

Crantz) has received worldwide attention in recent years as a biofuel crop and as a broadleaf option in cereal-based cropping systems. The objective of our 3 -year study was to determine <b>camelina</b> <b>seed</b> yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) as affected by six applied nitrogen (N) rates at four rainfed sites in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United States. An N + sulfur (S) variable was also included. Seed oil content as affected by applied N and S was also evaluated in 2010. The four sites and their average annual crop-year precipitation during the three years were Lind, WA (228 mm); Pendleton, OR (421 mm); Moscow/Pullman, ID (695 mm); and Corvallis, OR (1085). The majority of precipitation occurs in the winter and summers are comparatively dry. Camelina responded differently to applied N among sites based upon precipitation and available soil N. Seed yield did not respond to N rate treatments at Lind, presumably due to sufficient soil residual N and limited precipitation. Seed yield increased with applied N at Pendleton, Moscow/Pullman, and Corvallis. Optimum applied N rates ranged from 0 to 90 kg ha- 1 depending on annual precipitation and soil available N. Maximum seed yield increases attributable to applied N ranged from 19 % at Pendleton to 93 % at Moscow/Pullman. Camelina NUE was greatest at Moscow/Pullman although it decreased gradually with increasing applied N rates at all sites. Lind, Pendleton, and Corvallis had the same NUE of - 0. 06 kg seed for every kg of available N. Camelina did not respond to applied S at any site. Seed oil content was not affected by applied N or S. Based upon the results of this study, camelina requires about 12 kg N ha⁻¹ per 100 kg of expected seed yield...|$|E
40|$|Vegetable oils are {{important}} sources of food, feed and fuel. The value and usage {{can be enhanced}} by increased production of vitamin E and wax esters in the oil. To this end, this thesis explored the vitamin E and wax ester biosynthetic pathways in oil seed crops like soybean and camelina. Vitamin E consists of tocopherols, tocotrienols and provides oxidative stability to vegetable oils. Due to high antioxidant nature and limited occurence, production of tocotrienols in dicotyledonous oil seeds is expexted to improve oil functionality. Also, high alpha tocochromanols in vegetable oils enhances nutritional value. We generated soybean seeds with 6. 5 - to 7. 1 - fold increases in vitamin E, mainly through tocotrienols production by transgenic expression of barley homogentisate geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT). Also, generated seeds with 5. 4 - and 16 -fold increase in total vitamin E and alpha tocochromanols respectively by co-expressing soybean γ-tocopherol methyltransferase (γ-TMT/VTE 4) with barley HGGT. Further, introgression of high vitamin E trait into stearidonic rich soybean had improved oxidative stability of oil. We also, addressed the limitation of homogentisate production for increased vitamin E, using metabolic engineering strategies in <b>camelina.</b> <b>Seed</b> specific expression of down regulated homogentisate oxygenase (HGO) and de-regulated synthesis genes, Arabidopsis hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxigenase (HPPD) and Eschericia coli bi-functional chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydrogenase (TyrA) alone or in combination resulted drastic increase in homogentisate with limited increase in vitamin E content. Where as, in presence of HGGT expression, tremendous increase in homogentisate and total vitamin E content suggests that homogentisate is not a limiting factor for vitamin E synthesis, except in lines expressing HGGT and HGGT/HGO RNAi where free HGA was not accumulated. ^ Similarly, by exploring wax biosynthetic pathway we generated camelina lines producing novel wax esters with reduced chain length, mainly C 42 and C 44 consisting of C 20 and C 22 fatty acids and fatty alcohols, by co-expressing fatty acid reductase (FAR), wax synthase (WS) from jojoba with fatty acid elongase (FAE 1) from carmbe. In summary, we conclude that enhanced vitamin E increaed the oxidative stability of polyunsaturated fatty acids and increased alpha forms improves nutritional value of soybean oil. Also, wax esters with reduced chain length improve stability and functionality. ...|$|E

Diets were randomly assigned to 8 fermenters (1, 200 – 1, 250 mL) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square with four 10 -day experimental periods that consisted of 7 days for diet adaptation and 3 days for sample collection. Treatments were: (1) no CS at 5 % ether extract (EE, NCS 5); (2) no CS at 8 % EE (NCS 8); (3) 7. 7 % CS at 5 % EE (CS 5); and (4) 17. 7 % CS at 8 % EE (CS 8). Megalac was used as a control to adjust EE levels. Diets contained 55 % orchardgrass hay and 45 % concentrate, and fermenters were equally fed a total of 72 g/day (DM basis) twice daily. The bacterial community was determined by sequencing the V 4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequencing data were analyzed using mothur and statistical analyses were performed in R and SAS. The most abundant phyla across treatments were the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, accounting for 49 and 39 % of the total sequences, respectively. The bacterial community composition in both liquid and solid fractions of the effluent digesta changed with CS supplementation but not by dietary EE. Including CS in the diets decreased the relative abundances of Ruminococcus spp., Fibrobacter spp., and Butyrivibrio spp. The most abundant genus across treatments, Prevotella, was reduced by high dietary EE levels, while Megasphaera and Succinivibrio were increased by CS supplementation in the liquid fraction. Correlatively, the concentration of acetate was decreased while propionate increased; C 18 : 0 was decreased and polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 18 : 3 n- 3, were increased by CS supplementation. Based on the correlation analysis between genera and fermentation end products, this study revealed that CS supplementation could be energetically beneficial to dairy cows by increasing propionate-producing bacteria and suppressing ruminal bacteria associated with biohydrogenation. However, attention should be given to avoid the effects of CS supplementation on suppressing cellulolytic bacteria...|$|E

This study was carried out to identify the major proteins of the oil-free residue (meal) of C. sativa (camelina) while investigating their structural and physicochemical properties. Canola (Brassica napus L.) {{was used as the}} control in the study. <b>Camelina</b> <b>seeds</b> were treated with Viscozyme® (0. 1 mL/g) to remove mucilage. The mucilage free meal contained 51. 3 % protein (dwb, %N× 6. 25) which was greater than in canola. Both camelina and canola meals shared similar profiles for polypeptides and amino acids. At acidic pHs, canola meal had higher soluble protein content than did camelina meal, but the opposite was observed when the pH moved toward alkaline. A pH of 4. 5 identified as the apparent isoelectric point (pI) of the protein from these two meals, which is presumably a cruciferin-napin complex. The 11 S and 2 S proteins of both seed types were isolated and purified using liquid chromatography. The purified 11 S protein from camelina and canola contained predominantly cruciferin with minor contamination with non-targeted storage proteins. Of the non-cruciferin contamination of camelina, vicilin (7 S) found to be abundant. The purified 2 S protein from camelina contained napin and a noticeable amount of late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein, whereas non-napin contamination was minor in canola. In camelina, cruciferin, napin and vicilin expressed from eleven, four and six genes, respectively, were identified. The oil body proteins were also isolated and several isoforms of oleosin were found in camelina and canola, whereas putative isoforms of caleosin and steroleosin were found only in camelina. The structural and physicochemical properties of cruciferin and napin were studied in response to changing pH and temperature. The predominance of beta-structure and α-helix content in the 2 ˚ structure of cruciferin and napin, respectively, was confirmed for both camelina and canola. Cruciferin from camelina and canola exhibited acid-induced structural unfolding at the 3 ˚structure level. Cruciferin was not completely unfolded and assumed an intermediate state, plausibly a molten globule. Napin structure was not as sensitive as cruciferin to changing medium pH or an increase in temperature. Cruciferin exhibited high thermal stability (> 80 ˚C) at neutral and alkaline pH, whereas the opposite was observed at acidic pH. Results showed that the cruciferin and napin responded differently to changing pH and temperature.
