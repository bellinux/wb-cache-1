30|$|In circuit quantum electrodynamics, the {{controllable}} {{interaction of}} <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> {{is a highly}} desirable resource for quantum computation and quantum simulation experiments. The most common method is a static capacitive or inductive coupling between cavities and/or qubits. In such a system, exchange of excitations can be controlled by either tuning the <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> {{in and out of}} resonance or using sideband transitions [1 – 4]. While this approach has proven to be useful for few coupled <b>circuit</b> <b>elements,</b> it seems impracticable for larger systems, where it is hard to provide sufficient detunings between all <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> [5]. Therefore, one may alternatively use tunable coupling elements such as qubits [6 – 9] or SQUIDs [10 – 15]. One particular example for an interesting application of such actively coupled <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> are quantum simulations of bosonic many-body Hamiltonians [16 – 20]. In such a scenario, the bosonic degrees of freedom can be represented by networks of (possibly nonlinear) superconducting resonators. For this quantum simulator, a tunable coupler would constitute an important control knob. A more general scope of this device is the controllable routing of photonic states on a chip, which is interesting for quantum information as well as quantum simulation experiments.|$|R
25|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} at HP Labs announced a working memristor, a fourth basic passive <b>circuit</b> <b>element</b> whose existence only had been theorized previously. The memristor's unique properties permit {{the creation of}} smaller and better-performing electronic devices.|$|E
25|$|In his 1971 paper, Chua {{extrapolated}} {{a conceptual}} symmetry between the non-linear resistor (voltage vs. current), non-linear capacitor (voltage vs. charge) and non-linear inductor (magnetic flux linkage vs. current). He then inferred {{the possibility of}} a memristor as another fundamental non-linear <b>circuit</b> <b>element</b> linking magnetic flux and charge. In contrast to a linear (or non-linear) resistor the memristor has a dynamic relationship between current and voltage including a memory of past voltages or currents. Other scientists had proposed dynamic memory resistors such as the memistor of Bernard Widrow, but Chua attempted to introduce mathematical generality.|$|E
25|$|Resistance {{thermometers}} and thermistors {{are generally}} used in two ways. First, {{they can be}} used as thermometers: By measuring the resistance, the temperature of the environment can be inferred. Second, {{they can be used}} in conjunction with Joule heating (also called self-heating): If a large current is running through the resistor, the resistor's temperature rises and therefore its resistance changes. Therefore, these components {{can be used in a}} circuit-protection role similar to fuses, or for feedback in circuits, or for many other purposes. In general, self-heating can turn a resistor into a nonlinear and hysteretic <b>circuit</b> <b>element.</b> For more details see Thermistor#Self-heating effects.|$|E

40|$|Since the #rst {{reported}} #oating-gate {{structure in}} 1967, #oatinggate transistors {{have been used}} widely to store digital information for long periods in structures suchasEPROMs and EEPROMs. Recently, #oating-gate devices have found applications as analog memories, analog and digital <b>circuit</b> <b>elements,</b> and adaptive processing elements. Floating-gate devices have found commerical applications, e. g. ISD, for long-term non-volatile information storage devices for analog applications. The focus of #oating-gate devices has been towards fabrication in standard CMOS processes, {{as opposed to the}} specialized processes for fabricating digital nonvolatile memories. Floating-gate circuits can be designed at any or all of three levels: analog memory <b>elements,</b> capacitive-based <b>circuit</b> <b>elements,</b> and adaptive <b>circuit</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R
25|$|In general, neither {{impedance}} nor admittance can be {{time varying}} {{as they are}} defined for complex exponentials for –∞ < t < +∞. If the complex exponential voltage–current ratio changes over time or amplitude, the <b>circuit</b> <b>element</b> cannot be described using the frequency domain. However, many systems (e.g., varicaps {{that are used in}} radio tuners) may exhibit non-linear or time-varying voltage–current ratios that appear to be linear time-invariant (LTI) for small signals over small observation windows; hence, they can be roughly described as having a time-varying impedance. That is, this description is an approximation; over large signal swings or observation windows, the voltage–current relationship is non-LTI and cannot be described by impedance.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{original}} 1971 definition, the memristor was the fourth fundamental <b>circuit</b> <b>element,</b> forming a non-linear relationship between electric charge and magnetic flux linkage. In 2011 Chua argued for a broader definition that included all 2-terminal non-volatile memory devices based on resistance switching. Williams argued that MRAM, phase change memory and RRAM were memristor technologies. Some researchers argued that biological structures such as blood and skin fit the definition. Others argued that the memory device under development by HP Labs {{and other forms of}} RRAM were not memristors but rather part of a broader class of variable resistance systems and that a broader definition of memristor is a scientifically unjustifiable land grab that favored HP's memristor patents.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, a team at HP Labs {{claimed to}} have found Chua's missing memristor based on an {{analysis}} of a thin film of titanium dioxide thus connecting the operation of RRAM devices to the memristor concept. The HP result {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature. Following this claim, Leon Chua has argued that the memristor definition could be generalized to cover all forms of two-terminal non-volatile memory devices based on resistance switching effects. There are, however, some serious doubts as to whether the memristor can actually exist in physical reality. Additionally, some experimental evidence contradicts Chua's generalization since a non-passive nanobattery effect is observable in resistance switching memory. Chua also argued that the memristor is the oldest known <b>circuit</b> <b>element,</b> with its effects predating the resistor, capacitor and inductor.|$|E

25|$|Pure monocrystalline silicon is used {{to produce}} silicon wafers used in the {{semiconductor}} industry, in electronics, and in some high-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor, which means that unlike metals, it conducts electron holes and electrons released from atoms by heat; silicon's electrical conductivity increases with higher temperatures. Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a resistivity) {{to be used as}} a <b>circuit</b> <b>element</b> in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge (positive or negative) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for transistors, solar cells, semiconductor detectors, and other semiconductor devices used in the computer industry and other technical applications. In silicon photonics, silicon can be used as a continuous wave Raman laser medium to produce coherent light, though it is ineffective as an everyday light source.|$|E

40|$|A {{low noise}} RF signal phase {{comparator}} comprised of two high stability driver buffer amplifiers driving a double balanced mixer which operate {{to generate a}} beat frequency between the two RF input signals coupled to the amplifiers from the RF sources is described. The beat frequency output from the mixer is applied to a low noise zero crossing detector which is the phase {{difference between the two}} RF inputs. Temperature stability is provided by mounting the amplifiers and mixer on a common circuit board with the active <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> located on one side of a circuit board and the passive <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> located on the opposite side. A common heat sink is located adjacent the circuit board.
