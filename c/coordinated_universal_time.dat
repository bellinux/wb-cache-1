5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the <b>Coordinated</b> <b>Universal</b> <b>Time</b> (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E

40|$|Geocentric {{tracking}} station coordinates and short-period Earth-orientation variations {{can be measured}} with Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. Unless calibrated, geocentric coordinate errors and changes in Earth orientation can lead to significant deep-space tracking errors. Ground-based GPS estimates of daily and subdaily changes in Earth orientation presently show centimeter-level precision. Comparison between GPS-estimated Earth-rotation variations, which are the differences between <b>Universal</b> <b>Time</b> 1 and <b>Universal</b> <b>Coordinated</b> <b>Time</b> (UT 1 -UTC), and those calculated from ocean tide models suggests that observed subdaily variations in Earth rotation are dominated by oceanic tidal effects. Preliminary GPS estimates for the geocenter location (from a 3 -week experiment) agree with independent satellite laser-ranging estimates to better than 10 cm. Covariance analysis predicts that temporal resolution of GPS estimates for Earth orientation and geocenter improves significantly when data collected from low Earth-orbiting satellites {{as well as from}} ground sites are combined. The low Earth GPS tracking data enhance the accuracy and resolution for measuring high-frequency global geodynamical signals over time scales of less than 1 day...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. MICROTOPS II is a five-channel, {{handheld}} Sun photometer {{that can}} be configured to measure total ozone, total water vapor, or aerosol optical thickness at various wavelengths. The instrument measures 10 3 20 3 4. 3 cm and weighs 600 g. A principal design goal was the measurement of total ozone to within 1 % of ozone measurements made by much larger, heavier, and more expensive Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers. This goal has been met for a maximum air mass of up to; 2. 5, as demonstrated by comparisons of MICROTOPS II and its immediate predecessor, Supertops, with Dobson and Brewer instruments at various locations. Conventional interference filters are subject to gradual and unpredictable degradation. MICROTOPS II avoids these problems by using highly stable ultraviolet filters manufactured with an ion deposition process. The 2. 4 nm (FWHM) band pass of the UV filters was selected to balance noise and ozone measurement performance. The optical collimators and electronics of the instrument were carefully designed to optimize pointing accuracy, stray light rejection, thermal and long-term stability, signal-to-noise ratio, and data analysis. An internal microcomputer automatically calculates the total ozone column based on measurements at three UV wavelengths, the site’s geographic <b>coordinates,</b> and <b>universal</b> <b>time,</b> altitude, and pressure. The coordinates can be entered manually or by a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. A built-in pressure transducer automatically measures pressure. MICROTOPS II saves in nonvolatile memory up to 800 scans of the raw and calculated data. Measurements can be read from a liquid crystal display or transferred to an external computer. 1...|$|R
