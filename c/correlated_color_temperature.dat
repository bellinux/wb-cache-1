25|$|To {{deal with}} the problem of having to compare light sources of {{different}} <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> (CCT), the CIE settled on using a reference black body with the same <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> for lamps with a CCT of under 5000K, or a phase of CIE standard illuminant D (daylight) otherwise. This presented a continuous range of <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> to choose a reference from. Any chromaticity difference between the source and reference illuminants were to be abridged with a von Kries-type chromatic adaptation transform.|$|R
25|$|The CRI of a {{light source}} does not {{indicate}} the apparent color of the light source; that information is {{under the rubric of}} the <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> (CCT). The CRI is determined by the light source's spectrum. The pictures on the right show the continuous spectrum of an incandescent lamp and the discrete line spectrum of a fluorescent lamp; the former lamp has the higher CRI.|$|E
25|$|D50 is {{scientific}} {{shorthand for}} a standard illuminant: the daylight spectrum at a <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of 5000K. Similar definitions exist for D55, D65 and D75. Designations such as D50 {{are used to}} help classify color temperatures of light tables and viewing booths.

25|$|Color {{temperature}} can be {{indicated in}} kelvins or mireds (1 million {{divided by the}} color temperature in kelvins). The color temperature of a light source is the temperature of a black body that has the same chromaticity (i.e. color) as the light source. A notional temperature, the <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature,</b> the temperature of a black body which emits light of a hue which to human color perception most closely matches {{the light from the}} lamp, is assigned.|$|E

40|$|The {{covalent}} attachment {{of organic}} fluorophores in mesoporous silica matrices for usage as energy down converting phosphors without employing inorganic transition or {{rare earth metals}} is reported in this article. Triethoxysilylpropyl-substituted derivatives of the blue emitting perylene, green emitting benzofurazane, and red emitting Nile red were synthesized and applied in the synthesis of mesoporous hybrid materials by postsynthetic grafting to commercially available MCM- 41. These individually dye-functionalized hybrid materials are mixed in variable ratios to furnish a powder capable of emitting white light with CIE chromaticity coordinates of x = 0. 33, y = 0. 33 and an external quantum yield of 4. 6 % upon irradiation at 410 nm. Furthermore, as a proof of concept two different device setups of commercially available UV light emitting diodes, are coated with silica monoliths containing the three triethoxysilylpropyl-substituted fluorophore derivatives. These coatings are able to convert the emitted UV light into light with <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> of very cold white (41100 K, 10700 K) {{as well as a}} greenish white emission with <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> of about 5500 K...|$|R
25|$|The <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> {{of factory}} {{installed}} automotive HID headlamps is between 4100K and 5000K while tungsten-halogen lamps are at 3000K to 3550K. The spectral power distribution (SPD) of an automotive HID headlamp is discontinuous and spikey while the SPD of a filament lamp, {{like that of}} the sun, is a continuous curve. Moreover, the color rendering index (CRI) of tungsten-halogen headlamps (98) is much closer than that of HID headlamps (~75) to standardized sunlight (100). Studies have shown no significant safety effect of this degree of CRI variation in headlighting.|$|E
25|$|In simpler terms, the SPD of the studied {{daylight}} samples can {{be expressed}} as the linear combination of three, fixed SPDs. The first vector (S0) is the mean of all the SPD samples, {{which is the best}} reconstituted SPD that can be formed with only a fixed vector. The second vector (S1) corresponds to yellow–blue variation, accounting for changes in the <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> due to presence or absence of clouds or direct sunlight. The third vector (S2) corresponds to pink–green variation caused by the presence of water in the form of vapor and haze.|$|E
25|$|Many other light sources, such as {{fluorescent}} lamps, or LEDs (light emitting diodes) emit light {{primarily by}} processes other than thermal radiation. This {{means that the}} emitted radiation does not follow {{the form of a}} black-body spectrum. These sources are assigned what is known as a <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> (CCT). CCT is the color temperature of a black-body radiator which to human color perception most closely matches the light from the lamp. Because such an approximation is not required for incandescent light, the CCT for an incandescent light is simply its unadjusted temperature, derived from comparison to a black-body radiator.|$|E
2500|$|The CRI is {{calculated}} {{by comparing the}} color rendering of the test source {{to that of a}} [...] "perfect" [...] source, which is a black body radiator for sources with <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> under 5000K, and a phase of daylight otherwise (e.g., D65).

50|$|Early LED lamps varied {{greatly in}} {{chromaticity}} from the incandescent lamps they were replacing. A standard was developed, ANSI C78.377-2008, that specified the recommended color ranges for solid-state lighting products using cool to warm white LEDs with various <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperatures.</b> In June 2008, NIST announced {{the first two}} standards for solid-state lighting in the United States. These standards detail performance specifications for LED light sources and prescribe test methods for solid-state lighting products.|$|R
2500|$|Black-body {{radiators}} are {{the reference}} {{by which the}} whiteness of light sources is judged. A black body can be described by its color temperature, whose hues are depicted above. By analogy, nearly Planckian light sources such as certain fluorescent or high-intensity discharge lamps can be judged by their <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> (CCT), the color temperature of the Planckian radiator that best approximates them. For light source spectra that are not Planckian, color temperature is not a well defined attribute; the concept of <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> was developed to map such sources as well as possible onto the one-dimensional scale of color temperature, where [...] "as well as possible" [...] is defined {{in the context of}} an objective color space.|$|E
2500|$|Although the CCT can be {{calculated}} for any chromaticity coordinate, the result is meaningful only if the light sources are nearly white. The CIE recommends that [...] "The concept of <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> {{should not be used}} if the chromaticity of the test source differs more than [...] from the Planckian radiator." ...|$|E

5000|$|While {{the curve}} {{has been used}} as a guide to design {{artificial}} lighting for indoor spaces, with the general suggestion to use sources with low <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> at low illuminances, Kruithof did not describe the method of evaluation, the independent variables, nor the test sample that were used to develop the curve. Without these data, nor other validation, the conclusions should not be considered credible. The relationship between illuminance and CCT was not supported by subsequent work.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> (CCT) is {{a measure}} of the [...] "shade" [...] of {{whiteness}} of a light source compared with a blackbody. Typical incandescent lighting is 2700 K, which is yellowish-white. Halogen lighting is 3000 K. Fluorescent lamps are manufactured to a chosen CCT by altering the mixture of phosphors inside the tube. Warm-white fluorescents have CCT of 2700 K and are popular for residential lighting. Neutral-white fluorescents have a CCT of 3000 K or 3500 K. Cool-white fluorescents have a CCT of 4100 K and are popular for office lighting. Daylight fluorescents have a CCT of 5000 K to 6500 K, which is bluish-white.|$|E

B {{served as a}} representative of noon sunlight, with a <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> (CCT) of 4874K, while C represented average day light with a CCT of 6774K. Unfortunately, they are poor approximations of any phase of natural daylight, particularly in the short-wave visible and in the ultraviolet spectral ranges. Once more realistic simulations were achievable, Illuminants B & C were deprecated in favor of the D series:.

Besides the , other color indices can be used as well. The color temperature (as well as the <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> defined above) may differ largely from the effective temperature given by the radiative flux of the stellar surface. For example, the color temperature of an A0V star is about 15000 K compared to an effective temperature of about 9500 K.|$|E

2500|$|CFLs emit {{light from}} a mix of phosphors, each {{emitting}} one band of colour with some bands still in the ultraviolet range {{as can be seen}} on the light spectrum. This is the reason why additional UV filtering, for example double-envelope, is required to reduce damage to the retina. [...] Modern phosphor designs balance the emitted light color, energy efficiency, and cost. Every extra phosphor added to the coating mix improves color rendering but decreases efficiency and increases cost. Good quality consumer CFLs use three or four phosphors to achieve a [...] "white" [...] light with a color rendering index (CRI) of about 80, where the maximum 100 represents the appearance of colors under daylight or other sources of black-body radiation such as an incandescent light bulb (depending on the <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature).</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} approximations {{assume a}} display device at gamma 2.2, using the sRGB color space. The further a display device deviates from these standards, the less accurate these swatches will be. Swatches {{are based on}} the average measurements of several lots of single-pigment watercolor paints, converted from Lab color space to sRGB color space for viewing on a computer display. Different brands and lots of the same pigment may vary in color. Furthermore, pigments have inherently complex reflectance spectra that will render their [...] greatly different depending on the spectrum of the source illumination; a property called metamerism. Averaged measurements of pigment samples will only yield approximations of their true appearance under a specific source of illumination. Computer display systems use a technique called chromatic adaptation transforms to emulate the <b>correlated</b> <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of illumination sources, and cannot perfectly reproduce the intricate spectral combinations originally seen. In many cases, the perceived color of a pigment falls outside of the gamut of computer displays and a method called gamut mapping is used to approximate the true appearance. Gamut mapping trades off any one of lightness, hue, or saturation accuracy to render the color on screen, depending on the priority chosen in the conversion's ICC rendering intent.|$|E
