40|$|Following recent court rulings, {{cross-border}} loss {{compensation for}} multinational firms {{will likely be}} introduced, at least in Europe. This paper analyzes the effects of introducing a <b>coordinated</b> <b>cross-border</b> tax relief in a setting where multina-tional firms choose {{the size of a}} risky investment and host countries endogenously choose tax rates. We show that <b>coordinated</b> <b>cross-border</b> loss compensation is likely to intensify tax competition when, following current international practice, the parent firm’s home country bases the tax rebate for a loss-making subsidiary on its own tax rate. In equilibrium, tax revenue losses will then be even higher than is implied by the direct effect of the reform. In contrast, tax competition will be mitigated when the home country bases its loss relief on the tax rate in the subsidiary’s host country...|$|R

40|$|European power {{markets have}} become more {{integrated}} and the implementation of market coupling has reinforced the efficiency of cross-border trading. This paper investigates empirically the impact of renewables growth in Germany on German and French power price volatility. We find that renewables depress power prices on average and increase volatility not only domestically but also across borders. We also leverage market resiliency data to investigate the impact of increases in interconnection capacity. We find that power price volatility would decrease in France despite some contagion effects of volatility from German renewables production. Our findings have important policy implications as they demonstrate the need to <b>coordinate</b> <b>cross-border</b> support policies for renewables in order to mitigate the impact of volatility on power prices in coupled power markets...|$|R

40|$|In Germany and beyond, various {{capacity}} {{mechanisms are}} currently being discussed {{with a view to}} improving the security of electricity supply. One of these mechanisms is a strategic reserve that retains generation capacity for use in times of critical supply shortage. We argue that strategic reserves have specific advantages compared to other capacity mechanisms {{in the context of the}} European energy transition. To date, however, the debate on capacity mechanisms has largely been restricted to national contexts. Against this background, we discuss the feasibility and potential benefits of <b>coordinated</b> <b>cross-border</b> strategic reserves to safeguard electricity supply and aid the energy transition in Germany and neighboring countries at large. Setting aside strategic reserve capacity which is deployed only in the event of extreme supply shortages could improve the security of electricity supply without distorting the EU's internal electricity market. In addition, overall costs may decrease when reserve procurement and activation are coordinated among countries, particularly if combined with flow-based market coupling...|$|R
40|$|Cross-border {{regions in}} the European Union {{represent}} an extraordinary governance environment. Located peripherally at the interface of national planning systems and their various administrative levels, they contain multiple spatial dimensions of decision-making that don’t always match across borders. Domestic regulations often lack <b>cross-border</b> considerations. Similarly, <b>coordinated</b> international approaches to regulate cross-border development are rarely in place. This legal limbo together with weak enforcement and intentional undermining of existing regulations {{has led to the}} perpetuation of highly complex and merely non-transparent decision-making processes. In such a context, spatially relevant projects are frequently subject to international bargaining and informal power struggles that bear high potential for conflicts and hegemonies as recent developments such as the localization of large-scale retail businesses along the Luxembourgish border illustrate. This paper argues that institutionalized planning processes are frequently accompanied or even replaced by new and informal actor relationships where actors capitalize on cross-border inequalities and inconsistencies. Drawing on examples of retail development in the Greater Region it proposes an extended understanding of ‘governance’ that goes beyond integrating multiple spatial scales and acknowledging growing interdependences between government and non-government actors to incorporate multiple actors, informal interactions and new power relationships in border regions...|$|R

Additionally, several KIIs were conducted with money traders in the hawala system, wholesalers of goods (including humanitarian assistance), and researchers. A total of 91 key informants in Turkey and Syria were interviewed during the assessment including 25 key NGO informants from 14 NGOs, 33 community informants from 7 locations, 25 local council informants from 5 locations, and 8 others including donors, money transfer agents, and a wholesaler. Key informants were identified in consultation with the Cash-Based Response Technical Working Group (CBR-TWG) for <b>cross-border</b> humanitarian assistance <b>coordinated</b> from the Turkey hub. KIIs were conducted in person in Arabic or English depending on respondent preference. A notetaker was present, and at the conclusion of each interview, the interviewer and notetaker reached consensus on {{the final version of the}} notes. Key informant interview data were analyzed using content analysis methods with the aim of identifying key themes, consensus viewpoints, and viewpoints of a minority (within groups) or that were unique to certain contexts or locations.|$|R

5|$|It was {{not until}} 2 September 1870 that the new lieutenant-governor Adams George Archibald arrived and set about the {{establishment}} of civil government. Without an amnesty, and with the Canadian militia beating and intimidating his sympathisers, Riel fled {{to the safety of}} the St. Joseph's mission across the Canada–US border in the Dakota Territory. However the results of the first provincial election in December 1870 were promising for Riel, as many of his supporters came to power. Nevertheless, stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness—perhaps a harbinger of his future mental afflictions—that prevented his return to Manitoba until May 1871. The settlement now faced a possible threat, from <b>cross-border</b> Fenian raids <b>coordinated</b> by his former associate William Bernard O'Donoghue. Archibald proclaimed a general call to arms on 4 October. Companies of armed horsemen were raised, including one led by Riel. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel's hand, signaling that a rapprochement had been affected. This was not to be—when this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the Canada First movement whipped up anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec-Ontario relations and so he did not offer an amnesty. Instead he quietly arranged for Taché to offer Riel a bribe of $1,000 to remain in voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional £600 from Smith for the care of Riel's family.|$|R
40|$|Cross-border {{regional}} planning raises particular planning issues {{due to the}} different planning philosophies and mechanisms used in neighbouring state jurisdictions. This paper explores cross-border {{regional planning}} issues emerging in two rapidly urbanising adjacent regions on Australia‟s east coast: South East Queensland (SEQ) and Far North Coast New South Wales (FNC NSW). Using literature review and documentary research, the paper examines contemporary regional planning for these two regions in several contexts, including the rise of regional planning in Australia; conceptions of „central‟ and „remote‟ regions; and international comparison. The paper investigates the limited progress towards <b>coordinated</b> <b>cross-border</b> regional planning in an historical context in which a formerly rural border has become an urban border within one of Australia‟s fastest growing emerging “global city regions” (Simmonds and Hack 2000; Scott 2002). Current regional planning approaches differ markedly, with the SEQ Regional Plan defining a regional network of „TODs‟ (Queensland Government 2009) and the FNC Regional Strategy planning for “a region of villages” (NSW Government 2007). Comparisons are made with regional planning in other city regions where suburban expansion spills across state borders, in Australia and in Portland, Oregon and Clark County, Washington (USA) and the international borders between San Diego and Tijuana. It is concluded that the different conceptions of centrality and remoteness of the two Australian regions {{play a major role}} in the different regional planning approaches exhibited on the two sides of the state border...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the EU policy on {{electricity}} markets integration by reviewing {{the experience of the}} Electricity Regional Initiatives. The regional approach to market integration delivered important results in areas such as coordination among national transmission system operators, implementation of market-based mechanisms for cross-border transmission capacity allocation and transparency. Furthermore, the inclusive governance process lead by ERGEG gave voice to all relevant stakeholders. However, there are indications that the regional model reached its limit when faced with the objective of coordinating day-ahead and real-time markets. The unanimity approach at the regional level made the intra-regional decision-making process extremely slow. Further, inter-regional integration issues have not been solved yet and attempts to tackle them by prioritising projects in some Regions weakened the pluralistic attributes of the regional model. The Third Legislative Energy Package has the potential to overcome some of these shortcomings by empowering pan-European institutions (ENTSO and ACER) and by involving Member States in the decision making process. Some weaknesses of the second-package, though, persist in the new framework. First, there are no provisions ensuring that ENTSO will have appropriate incentives to act in the interest of European consumers. Second, the Third Package perpetuates the separation between within-country congestion management – which remains a national issue – and cross-border congestion management – to be dealt with at the EU level. This two-tier approach is inconsistent with the highly meshed nature of the European network and is likely to result in inefficient market design. Further, the implementation of <b>coordinated</b> <b>cross-border</b> and national congestion management mechanisms requires considering geographically differentiated prices within countries, a politically unattractive result for most Member States. retail competition, electricity regulation...|$|R
40|$|In 1925, the British {{government}} sent {{a delegation}} to the Fifth Session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law. The Hague Conference had met sporadically since 1893, 1 {{but this was the}} first time the British government sent a delegation to The Hague to discuss the possibility of a diplomatic convention to reach international agreement on uniform rules on what continental Europeans called “private international law” — matters of jurisdiction, applicable law and procedure. The British delegation held limited authority from the Home Office: it could participate only in deliberations on a possible convention on bankruptcy law, and then only along the instructions provided to it. Given these narrow directions, it is perhaps not surprising that the British delegation left the 1925 conference before it ended and without agreement on a bankruptcy convention. It is, however, surprising today to realize that conversations about conflicts of law rules in international bankruptcies have been going on for almost 90 years. It is even more surprising that the contours of that discussion contain lessons that remain timely. This Article reviews the history of the 1925 Hague Conference proceedings on bankruptcy. My goal is both to reveal this history and to consider it in light of more recent transnational instruments <b>coordinating</b> <b>cross-border</b> bankruptcy proceedings, including the EU Regulation, UNCITRAL’s Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, and current proposals pending before the UN’s Commission on International Trade Law to consider the drafting of an international instrument to address certain conflicts of law rules applicable in cross-border insolvency proceedings. The paper proceeds in four parts. Part I provides a brief history of the beginnings of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, including Britain’s reticence to participate in this Conference. Part II discusses several initiatives on the topic of international bankruptcy presented before and by the International Law Association (ILA), especially a paper presented at the ILA’s 1924 session by an influential British solicitor, E. Leslie Burgin. Burgin’s efforts are emphasized because he seemed to have succeeded in convincing His Majesty’s Government to attend the Hague Conference on the topic of international bankruptcy law. Part III details preparations for participation in the 1925 conference by Great Britain’s Board of Trade. Part IV considers the proceedings of this Hague Conference on bankruptcy. A final section reflects, with the passage of time, on important lessons learned in this experience, with emphasis on the importance of the form of uniform ruleson conflicts of law in this context...|$|R
