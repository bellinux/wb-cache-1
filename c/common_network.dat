25|$|The Hopewell {{tradition}} {{was not a}} single culture or society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations, who were connected by a <b>common</b> <b>network</b> of trade routes, known as the Hopewell Exchange System. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Southeastern United States into the southeastern Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Within this area, societies participated in a high degree of exchange; most activity was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes. The Hopewell exchange system traded materials from all over the United States.|$|E

This observation suggests that executive function is mediated by dynamic and flexible networks that are characterized using functional integration and effective connectivity analyses. The complete circuit underlying executive function includes both {{a direct and}} an indirect circuit. The neural circuit responsible for executive functioning is, in fact, located primarily in the frontal lobe.

25|$|Currently most {{operating}} systems support {{a variety of}} networking protocols, hardware, and applications for using them. This means that computers running dissimilar {{operating systems}} can participate in a <b>common</b> <b>network</b> for sharing resources such as computing, files, printers, and scanners using either wired or wireless connections. Networks can essentially allow a computer's operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local computer. This includes everything from simple communication, to using networked file systems or even sharing another computer's graphics or sound hardware. Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently, such as SSH which allows networked users direct access to a computer's command line interface.|$|E

In 2008 both operations showed a positive EBITDA. In Sweden the mobile network is shared with Telenor, except for cities like Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmo, Lund and Karlskrona where they handle their own 3G networks, but this practise is not allowed in Denmark. In the spring 2011 3 started, without Telenor, to build their own 3G Network on the UMTS 900-band which will give a bigger coverage. UMTS 900 and LTE 800 is rolled out using the same base stations. Today 3 Sweden covers about 98.5% of the Swedish population. In May 2012, 3 Sweden launched it first LTE services. It uses the TDD2600, FDD2600 and FDD800 bands. According to ZTE, this is the world's first LTE network to use both FDD and TDD at the same time. At the beginning of 2014, 3 Sweden was Sweden's fastest growing mobile operator.|$|E
