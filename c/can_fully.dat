The total amount of GPUs is 13. The video cards together bring 12 teraflops of computing power. Four of the six GTX 295 video cards have 2 PCBs, while the other two have only 1 PCB.|$|E
5|$|Kaminsky {{stands up}} Incanto while he waits at a restaurant. He leaves, murdering a {{slightly}} overweight prostitute who injures {{him in a}} struggle. Incanto is forced to flee before he <b>can</b> <b>fully</b> dissolve the body. At the autopsy, Scully finds that the body's airways are choked with the same substance that dissolved Lauren. The State Genetic Lab report reveals that the skin under the victim's nails contains no oils or fatty acids, convincing Mulder that the killer is sucking body fat from his victims.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} temples within Phlan, each {{dedicated}} to different gods. Each temple can heal {{those who are}} wounded, poisoned, or afflicted, and <b>can</b> <b>fully</b> restore deceased comrades for a high price. The party can also visit the hiring hall and hire an experienced NPC adventurer to accompany the party. Encounters with NPCs in shops and taverns offer valuable information. Listening to gossip in taverns can be helpful to characters, although some tavern tales are false and lead characters into great danger.|$|E

5|$|The Decepticons {{learn from}} NSA Chief Galloway that Megatron is buried {{deep in the}} Laurentian Abyss. Starscream {{disables}} the Deep-6 aircraft carriers that guard Megatron's remains in the Laurentian Abyss, allowing the Decepticons {{to gain access to}} Megatron's remains. Megatron is revived, and the Decepticons return to the east coast. Megatron disables Optimus Prime and has Starscream destroy a museum that Sam entered, but he is not among the ruins. They learn he was transported to Cairo, Egypt via a space bridge created by Jetfire. Megatron arrives on the outskirts of Cairo and engages Autobots in combat. Jetfire and Bumblebee challenge him, but are defeated. Elsewhere, Long Haul destroys the Axion Gun that the Autobots gave to the NEST Troops. Megatron learns that The Fallen has betrayed him by promising to make him a Prime, learning that Primes are born, not made. Megatron then destroys him before he <b>can</b> <b>fully</b> activate the Sun Harvester, later hearing from Starscream that Optimus Prime has deactivated the machine. Victorious, he begins plans to form an army of new Decepticons.|$|E

25|$|At {{the rate}} {{technology}} is changing, no firm <b>can</b> <b>fully</b> keep {{up in the}} innovations needed to compete. Instead, smart firms are drawing {{on the power of}} mass collaboration to involve participation of the people they could not employ. This also helps generate continual interest in the firm in the form of those drawn to new idea creation as well as investment opportunities.|$|E

25|$|In Buddhism, {{women can}} openly aspire to and {{practice}} for {{the highest level of}} spiritual attainment. Buddhism is unique among Indian religions in that the Buddha as founder of a spiritual tradition explicitly states in canonical literature that a woman is as capable of nirvana as men and <b>can</b> <b>fully</b> attain all four stages of enlightenment. There is no equivalent in other traditions to the accounts found in the Therigatha or the Apadanas that speak of high levels of spiritual attainment by women.|$|E

25|$|In the Philippines, amulets {{are called}} agimat or anting-anting. According to folklore, the most {{powerful}} anting-anting is the hiyas ng saging (directly translated as pearl or gem of the banana). The hiyas must come from a mature banana and only comes out during midnight. Before the person <b>can</b> <b>fully</b> possess this agimat, he must fight a supernatural creature called kapre. Only then will he be its true owner. During Holy Week, devotees travel to Mount Banahaw to recharge their amulets.|$|E
25|$|Slug, or land slug, is {{a common}} name for any {{apparently}} shell-less terrestrial gastropod mollusc. The word slug is also often used {{as part of the}} common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, a very reduced shell, or only a small internal shell, particularly sea slugs and semislugs (this is in contrast to the common name snail, which applies to gastropods that have a coiled shell large enough that the animal <b>can</b> <b>fully</b> retract its soft parts into the shell).|$|E

25|$|Digital piano - Electronic {{keyboards}} {{designed to}} sound {{and feel like}} an ordinary acoustic piano. They typically contain a amplifier and loudspeaker built into the instrument. In most cases they <b>can</b> <b>fully</b> replace acoustic pianos and provide several features, such as recording and saving files to a computer. Many digital pianos can imitate the sounds of several instruments, including a grand piano, electric piano, pipe organ, Hammond organ and harpsichord.

25|$|The Fragility of Goodness {{confronts the}} ethical dilemma that {{individuals}} strongly committed to justice are nevertheless vulnerable to external {{factors that may}} deeply compromise or even negate their human flourishing. Discussing literary as well as philosophical texts, Nussbaum seeks {{to determine the extent}} to which reason may enable self-sufficiency. She eventually rejects the Platonic notion that human goodness <b>can</b> <b>fully</b> protect against peril, siding with the tragic playwrights and Aristotle in treating the acknowledgment of vulnerability as a key to realizing the human good.|$|E
25|$|Popping {{results are}} {{sensitive}} to {{the rate at which the}} kernels are heated. If heated too quickly, the steam in the outer layers of the kernel can reach high pressures and rupture the hull before the starch in the center of the kernel <b>can</b> <b>fully</b> gelatinize, leading to partially popped kernels with hard centers. Heating too slowly leads to entirely unpopped kernels: the tip of the kernel, where it attached to the cob, is not entirely moisture-proof, and when heated slowly, the steam can leak out of the tip fast enough to keep the pressure from rising sufficiently to break the hull and cause the pop.|$|E
