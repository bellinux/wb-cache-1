50|$|Over time, {{there were}} three {{governmental}} administrations within the Batavia region. The initial authority, (Hoge Regering; High Government), was established in 1609. This became the colonial government, consisting of the Governor-General and the Council of the Indies. The urban or civil administration {{of the city of}} Batavia, (College van Schepenen; Council of Aldermen), was formed in 1620. On 24 June 1620 two Company officials and three free citizens or burghers were appointed to the first College van Schepenen <b>College</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aldermen.</b> The local rural administration, (College van Heemraden; District Council), was formed in 1664 but became fully functional in 1682.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} {{is operated}} in a two-tier system.

Municipalities are responsible for education, spatial planning and social security, within the bounds prescribed by the national and provincial government. They are governed by the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Mayor and <b>Aldermen.</b> The Mayor is appointed by the national Cabinet and responsible to the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. The Aldermen are appointed by, and responsible to the Municipal Council, which is elected by direct suffrage. Local government on the Caribbean Netherlands is formed by three public bodies sometimes called special municipalities who do not fall within a province.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{influence}} of a new regulatory framework (approved in 2010) concerning strategic management in the Flemish municipalities. Particularly, the paper’s focus is on the impact of the introduction of the policy and management cycle on the management team’s (MT) role in the formulation, execution and evaluation of local policy. The empirical analysis is mainly based on two surveys performed in 2008 and 2013 among municipal secretaries. Statistical regression analysis suggests the varying implementation and use of this new regulatory framework has an important influence on the role MT’s play in the policy cycle. MT’s play a more important role in the municipal policy cycle when more policy goals are formulated. Also the involvement of the MT’s members in preparing the strategic multi-annual budgets is of importance. In sum, the added variables concerning strategic management in 2013 affords a model with far greater explanatory power. Furthermore, the MT’s role depends on the prevailing organizational culture: in municipalities where heads of department and the mayor and <b>college</b> <b>of</b> <b>aldermen</b> cooperate on equal basis and where the note of agreement between MT and college is considered more important, MT’s have more influence. By contrast, the municipal context variables have a far less explanatory power. status: publishe...|$|E
5000|$|Article 125 {{indicates}} the main administrative organs {{of the lower}} territorial administrative bodies: {{in the case of}} the provinces these are the States-Provincial; the municipalities are administrated by the municipal councils. Their sessions are public, except in cases regulated by formal law; delegation is allowed (Subarticle 1). The sessions of the States-Provincial are presided by the Commissioner of the King, those of the municipal councils by the mayor (Subarticle 3). The Commissioner of the King is also part of the provincial administration as are the Deputised States; the mayor is also part of the municipal administration, as is the <b>College</b> <b>of</b> Mayor and <b>Aldermen</b> (Subarticle 2). In this system the administrative organs exert the function of both the executive and legislative (Article 127); however, to form the daily administration they appoint Deputised States (for provinces) or the <b>Colleges</b> <b>of</b> Mayor and <b>Aldermen</b> (municipalities). In 2002 the system underwent a major revision the [...] "aldermen" [...] (wethouders) and States Deputised were no longer allowed to be members of the municipal councils or States Provincial respectively. This makes their function designation a misnomer, although the etymology of the word [...] "wethouder" [...] or [...] "deputised" [...] is no longer commonly understood. The Commissioner of the King and the mayor are officials, appointed by Royal Decree (Article 131). A proposed revision to introduce an elected mayor, recently was rejected by the Senate. The mayor has some legal executive powers of his own, mainly regarding the protection of public order, but these have no direct constitutional basis, they are delegated by the national legislator. Article 126 states, however, that formal law may determine that instructions regarding his office may be given to the Commissioner of the King by the national government. For cases of gross neglect of administrative duty, formal law will regulate the kind of provisions to be made in deviation of Articles 125 and 127 (Article 132, sub 4) ...|$|R
