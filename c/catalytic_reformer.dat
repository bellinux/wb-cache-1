Pure ammonia burns poorly at the atmospheric pressures found in natural gas fired water heaters and stoves.

40|$|Catalytic {{reforming}} of naphtha {{for improving}} its characteristics {{is one of}} the most important petroleum refining catalytic processes. Modern <b>catalytic</b> <b>reformers</b> utilize dual function platinum-based catalysts which during operation are exposed to the formation of carbonaceous deposits causing gradual deterioration of their activity and alteration of their selectivity. In-situ regeneration has proved to be adequate practice in restoring a catalyst's activity as well as its selectivity. Hence, optimization of regeneration is a vital step of the reforming process. This is usually done under conditions of a general nature that have been recommended by catalyst manufacturers and/or suppliers. Results of thorough laboratory investigations on the thermal behavior of used reforming catalyst (spent samples) revealed that the amount and complexity of the chemical nature of carbonaceous deposits on reforming catalysts are directly related to its life on stream and severity of operating conditions. Optimal regeneration of the catalyst requires specific conditions that take into consideration behavior and combustibility of carbonaceous deposits on its surface.

The oil obtained after condensing the reformulated gas is named as WEOZ. To know the suitability of using the WEOZ as alternate fuel for IC engines, the different properties of WEOZ were determined. The different properties include specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, flash and fire point, gross calorific value, pour point, density. The properties of WEOZ were compared to that of diesel fuel. All the fuel properties are closer to that of the neat diesel fuel. The FTIR analysis was also be conducted for diesel and WEOZ. The result of FTIR analysis was compared to that of diesel fuel. The FTIR result revealed that the major transmittance spectrums peak for diesel and WEOZ were alkanes and the presence of the hydrocarbon was clearly seen in the WEOZ. Based on this investigation, it was suggested that WEOZ has a potential to be used as alternate fuel for diesel engine.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{computational model}} {{for the design of}} methane catalytic partial oxidation monolith reactors for hydrogen production has been developed and tested with respect to available experimental data. Allowing a simplified description of the heat release mechanism associated with the reforming process, the model represents a useful tool to address performances and durability issues in the design process of full scale <b>catalytic</b> <b>reformers.</b> The characteristic temperature peak along the catalyst channels, which is experimentally observed {{as a result of the}} competitive action of fuel complete oxidation and steam reforming is, in fact, a fundamental parameter to be controlled during the design process and is a complex function of catalyst formulation, mixture composition, and actual operating conditions. To address this issue in the present paper the heat release law mechanism has been studied with a new approach named heat release curves model (HRCM), which decouples the thermofluid dynamic analysis of real geometries from the modeling of heterogeneous chemistry. The model uses heat release curves extrapolated from detailed heterogeneous chemistry calculation or experimental measurements as the basis of a simplified, although still predictive, evaluation of the heat released, which allows a substantial reduction in computational costs. Validation of HRCM model (including heat release profiles approximation) with respect to more detailed simulations and available experimental data shows very good predictive capabilities with a maximum error lower than the 4 % over a wide number of analyzed cases (accounting for several O/C ratios, inlet velocities, channel dimensions, and mean temperatures).
