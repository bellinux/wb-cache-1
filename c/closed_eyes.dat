5|$|Potbelly sculptures are {{generally}} rough sculptures that show considerable variation {{in size and}} {{the position of the}} limbs. They depict obese human figures, usually sat cross-legged with their arms upon their stomach. They have puffed out or hanging cheeks, <b>closed</b> <b>eyes</b> and are of indeterminate gender.|$|E
5|$|The chicks hatch 12–14days after {{incubation}} begins. Like all passerines, {{the chicks}} are altricial; they are hatched naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey down, and <b>closed</b> <b>eyes.</b> The mother bird feeds her young regurgitated seeds and insects as they grow. The hatchlings develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing {{the growth of}} olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11–15days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up to three weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.|$|E
5|$|One {{theory is}} that the sculptures {{represent}} deceased individuals with bloated bodies, <b>closed</b> <b>eyes,</b> distended bellies and puffed out faces. The position of the limbs on some monuments, although following the natural contours of the boulder, give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that Pasaco Monument 2 and the potbelly from San Juan Sacatepéquez portray the placement of a jade bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains. One of these is a ceramic potbelly from Colha in Belize, the others are from Chalchuapa and Kaminaljuyu. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.|$|E

5|$|The {{eggs are}} {{incubated}} {{for an average}} of 11days (range 10–16). Both adults incubate, although only the female stays on the nest at night. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with <b>closed</b> <b>eyes,</b> and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 11–12days after hatching, leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two or three weeks. If the nest is threatened, the non-incubating bird gives an alarm call so that the sitting parent and chicks stay still and quiet. A male blackcap may mob a potential predator, or try to lure it away with disjointed runs and flaps on the ground. The blackcap normally raises just one brood, but second nestings are sometimes recorded, particularly in the milder climate of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic islands; triple brooding has been observed once, the female laying a total of 23 eggs in the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} breeding {{habitat in}} Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting; despite its name, gardens are rarely occupied by this small passerine bird. The clutch {{of four or}} five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust cup-shaped nest built near the ground and concealed by dense vegetation. The eggs are incubated for 11–12days. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with <b>closed</b> <b>eyes,</b> and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10days after hatching. Only about a quarter of young birds survive their first year. The garden warbler is strongly migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. A wide range of habitats are used in Africa, but closed forest and treeless Sahel are both shunned. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, although fruit predominates when birds are fattening prior to migration, figs being a particular favourite where available. These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and fruit in their African wintering grounds.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with <b>closed</b> <b>eyes</b> {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E

25|$|Mating between hyenas {{involves}} {{a number of}} short copulations with brief intervals, unlike canids, who generally engage in a single, drawn out copulation. Spotted hyena cubs are born almost fully developed, with their eyes open and erupting incisors and canines, though lacking adult markings. In contrast, striped hyena cubs are born with adult markings, <b>closed</b> <b>eyes</b> and small ears. Hyenas do not regurgitate food for their young and male spotted hyenas play no part in raising their cubs, though male striped hyenas do so.|$|E
25|$|The {{gestation}} period lasts 90–91 days. Striped hyena cubs {{are born with}} adult markings, <b>closed</b> <b>eyes</b> and small ears. This is {{in marked contrast to}} newborn spotted hyena cubs which are born almost fully developed, though with black, unmarked coats. Their eyes open after 7–8 days, and the cubs leave their dens after one month. Cubs are weaned at the age of 2 months, and are then fed by both parents. Despite the males' assistance, female hyenas are very protective of their cubs, and will chase their mates away from the cubs if they approach too closely. By autumn, the cubs are half the size of their parents. In the wild, striped hyenas can live for 12 years, while in captivity they have been known to reach 23.|$|E

25|$|The Transcendental Meditation {{technique}} {{is a specific}} form of mantra meditation developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. It {{is often referred to}} as Transcendental Meditation or simply, TM. The meditation practice involves the use of a mantra, and is practiced for 15–20 minutes twice per day, while sitting with <b>closed</b> <b>eyes.</b> It is reported to be one of the most widely practiced, and among the most widely researched, meditation techniques, with hundreds of studies published. The {{technique is}} made available worldwide by certified TM teachers in a seven step course and fees vary from country to country. Beginning in 1965, the Transcendental Meditation technique has been incorporated into selected schools, universities, corporations and prison programs in the U.S.A., Latin America, Europe, and India. In 1977, the TM technique and the Science of Creative Intelligence were deemed religious activities as taught in two New Jersey public schools. Subsequently the TM technique has received some governmental support.|$|E

500|$|When {{necessary}} physicians, surgeons and pathologists download {{information about}} patients' species into their minds from [...] "Educator tapes", {{recordings of the}} memories of great practitioners in the appropriate species. However, in addition to medical knowledge, the educator tapes also capture the personalities of the medical experts who recorded them. Thus having an educator tape active threatens the recipient with multiple personality disorder. The new personality is from a vastly different species, often with very different behavior codes and sexual preferences, and, to make matters worse, the donors were often very dominant personalities. The mildest symptom of such conflicts is a running gag in which users of these tapes are often seen in the Sector General's cafeteria, eating a bland-looking sandwich with <b>closed</b> <b>eyes.</b> On the other hand, [...] the risk of finding members of other species sexually attractive is a serious concern.|$|E
500|$|Bates {{suggested}} {{closing the}} eyes for {{minutes at a}} time to help bring about relaxation. He asserted that the relaxation could be deepened in most cases by [...] "palming", or covering the <b>closed</b> <b>eyes</b> with the palms of the hands, without putting pressure on the eyeballs. If the covered eyes did not strain, he said, they would see [...] "a field so black {{that it is impossible to}} remember, imagine, or see anything blacker", since light was excluded by the palms. However, he reported that some of his patients experienced [...] "illusions of lights and colors" [...] sometimes amounting to [...] "kaleidoscopic appearances" [...] as they [...] "palmed", occurrences he attributed to his ubiquitous [...] "strain" [...] and that he claimed disappeared when one truly relaxed.

500|$|The nest {{consists}} of grass stems, strips of bark, and other fibrous material which is bound and woven together with spider web. Even hair from pet {{dogs and cats}} may be used. It has also been observed attempting to take hair from a pet goat. An alpaca breeder in the Mudgee District of New South Wales has observed alpaca fleece in the nests of willy wagtails (the results of scraps of fleece not picked up at shearing time). The female lays two to four small cream-white eggs with brownish markings measuring , and incubates them for 14days. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial and nidicolous; they are born naked and helpless with <b>closed</b> <b>eyes,</b> and remain in the nest. Both parents take part in feeding the young, and may {{continue to do so}} while embarking on another brood. Nestlings remain in the nest for around 14days before fledging. Upon leaving, the fledglings will remain hidden in cover nearby for one or two days before venturing further afield, up to [...] away by the third day. Parents will stop feeding their fledglings {{near the end of the}} second week, as the young birds increasingly forage for themselves, and soon afterwards drive them out of the territory.|$|E
500|$|The first {{eggs are}} laid in late April in {{southern}} Germany, early May in northwest Europe, and late May in Finland. The season is prolonged with some birds nesting {{as late as}} July. The clutch is typically four or five eggs (range two to six), which are usually whitish or buff with grey, purple and brown blotches. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated for 11–12days by both adults, although only the female stays on the nest at night. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with <b>closed</b> <b>eyes,</b> and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10days after hatching (range 9–12), leaving the nest shortly before {{they are able to}} fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two weeks, and the family may stay together for a few days after that. The short incubation and fledging times may be a result of predation pressure, the rapid development of the chicks enabling them to leave the vulnerable nest as early as possible, even while still flightless. This avoids the possible loss of an entire brood, but means that the adults must provide food to the young for a significant period until they can fend for themselves. [...] One brood per year is normal, although a few second broods are known.|$|E
