2500|$|Sucralose {{is found}} in many food and {{beverage}} products, used {{because it is a}} no-calorie sweetener, does not promote dental cavities, is as safe for consumption by diabetics and nondiabetics, and does not affect insulin levels, although the sucralose-based sweetener product Splenda contains 95% (by volume) bulking agents dextrose and maltodextrin that do affect insulin levels. Sucralose is used as a replacement for, or in combination with, other artificial or natural sweeteners such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium or high-fructose corn syrup. Sucralose is used in products such as candy, breakfast bars and soft drinks. [...] It is also used in <b>canned</b> <b>fruits</b> wherein water and sucralose take the place of much higher calorie corn syrup-based additives. Sucralose mixed with maltodextrin or dextrose (both made from corn) as bulking agents is sold internationally by McNeil Nutritionals under the Splenda brand name. In the United States and Canada, this blend is increasingly found in restaurants, in yellow packets, in contrast to the blue packets commonly used by aspartame and the pink packets used by those containing saccharin sweeteners; in Canada, though, yellow packets are also associated with the SugarTwin brand of cyclamate sweetener.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the dental health of 12 -year-old children from households that are supplied with sweetened <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> from local factories. METHODS: The DMFS and DMFT indices were determined for 12 -year-old pupils from 6 schools, 3 {{of which are}} situated in communities with <b>fruit</b> <b>canning</b> factories. Subjects were questioned about the workplace of household members and supplies of sweetened <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> from factories. To compare indices we used a two-way analysis of variance, for multiple comparisons the Bonferroni Test and for proportions the Chi-Squared Test. Fluoride content of the drinking water was measured for each school. RESULTS: The fluoride content for all schools was less than 0. 1 ppm. In only 2 schools were the majority of pupils from households that were supplied regularly with <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> from factories. An analysis of the DMFT data {{of the children in}} all the schools showed that there were significantly fewer children with a DMFT = 0 and significantly more with a DMFT = 4 + in the 2 schools. The mean DMFS and DMFT of children in households supplied with <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> were significantly higher than those children without the supply. CONCLUSION: The supply of sweetened <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> to households may be an added risk to dental health for the children in that household. Articl...|$|R

"There {{was work}} in plenty there, making the tin cans in which salmon and other fish is packed, and as I was industrious I soon had a shop of my own, and {{supplied}} cans to the packers. The shop grew to {{be a great}} factory, employing hundreds of men. Then I bought up the factories of my competitors, so as to control the market, and as I used so much tin-plate I became interested in the manufacture of this product, and invested a good deal of money in the production and perfection of American tin. My factories were now scattered all along the coast, even to California, where I made the cans for the great quantities of <b>canned</b> <b>fruits</b> they ship from that section every year.

40|$|Graduation date: 1953 Approximately 200 raw prunes were {{harvested}} {{from each of}} five Italian prune trees near Corvallis every three days for nine consecutive harvest dates. Forty individual fruit from each tree were drawn at random and subjected {{to a series of}} fresh fruit quality tests. For each quality factor which was measured, the experiments were set up as nine by five factorial analysis of variance studies with the numbers of observations in a replication depending upon the factor being studied. The correlation of each objective and subjective test with <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> flavor was then calculated. The regression line, standard error of estimate, and 90 percent confidence limits were calculated for each tests which had a correlation of 0. 80 or better with <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> flavor. Several objective tests were used on raw prunes such as soluble solids-acid ratio, pressure test, percent soluble solids, titratable acidity and color of raw prune flesh measured by the Hunter Color-Color Difference Meter in the order named are significantly correlated with the flavor of the canned Italian prune. Analysis of variance and L. S. D. was used to determine that the first two of these tests show good three-day precision as a guide to harvest maturity. The others appear suitable for longer time intervals. Certain objective tests such as pH values and fresh fruit weight are of little value to predict <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> flavor and show poor three-day precision as a guide to harvest maturity. The subjective grading of raw prunes by outer skin appearance {{does not seem to be}} a precise way to predict <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> quality. The three-day precision as a guide to harvest maturity is poor. Respiration of the fresh fruit shows a definite climacteric and the climacteric appeared at approximately the same time the fruit harvested exhibited optimum <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> flavor and color. The remaining lot of fruit after the fresh fruit samples were removed was placed in 32 °F. cold storage and held for processing the next day. Fruit from each tree each harvest date were processed in twelve No. 2 <b>fruit</b> enameled <b>cans</b> for use in <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> analysis studies. Several canned prune quality factors such as percent transmittance of the <b>canned</b> juice, <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> skin color as measured by the Hunter Color-Color Difference Meter and titratable acidity of the canned prune pulp can be used to predict or specify the <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> flavor. Other objective tests used on canned prunes such as pH values, cut-out soluble solids and cut-out soluble solids-acid ratio are not highly correlated with <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> flavor. Subjective tests used on canned prunes were color and flavor of the fruit. These factors were judged by a statistically selected panel of judges. The correlation between color and flavor of the <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> was the highest of the study (r= -. 9458). The subjective color measurement seems to be very precise in predicting <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> flavor. Every subjective and objective test carried out on the raw and canned prunes were correlated with <b>canned</b> <b>fruit</b> flavor because this factor was felt to be of singular importance in canned prune quality.
