2500|$|The Stanfield-led Progressive Conservatives {{lost the}} 1974 {{election}} to the Pierre Trudeau-led Liberals, leading to Stanfield's resignation as leader. [...] Mulroney, despite never having run for elected office, entered the contest to replace him. Mulroney and provincial rival Claude Wagner were both seen as potentially able to improve the party's standing in Quebec, which had supported the federal Liberals for decades. Mulroney had played the lead role in recruiting Wagner to the PC party a few years earlier, and the two wound up as rivals for Quebec delegates, {{most of whom were}} snared by Wagner, who even blocked Mulroney from becoming a voting delegate at the convention. In the leadership race, Mulroney spent an estimated $500,000, far more than the other candidates, and earned himself the nickname 'Cadillac candidate'. At the 1976 leadership convention, Mulroney placed second on the first ballot behind Wagner. However, his expensive campaign, slick image, lack of parliamentary experience, and vague policy positions did not endear him to many delegates, and he was unable to build upon his base support, being overtaken by eventual winner Joe Clark on the second ballot. Mulroney {{was the only one of}} the eleven leadership candidates who did not provide full financial disclosure on his <b>campaign</b> <b>expenses,</b> and his campaign finished deeply in debt. Following the convention, Mulroney turned down the offer of a shadow cabinet portfolio in Clark's caucus.|$|E

50|$|The {{total number}} of first {{preference}} votes received by the seven independent candidates was reasonable at 2131, particularly given that the independent candidates campaigned on a shoe-string budget. There was no television, radio or print advertising available to the “No Rodeo” independent candidates as funds simply did not permit. The major <b>campaign</b> <b>expense</b> was the purchase of election posters, yet the {{total number of}} election posters used by the “No Rodeo” candidates was still only 400. This small number of posters was divided between the seven candidates. Even without deliberate sabotage, such a poster campaign was dwarfed by the number of posters in use by minor and major parties.|$|R

Interviews with 14 civically involved Londoners were conducted, in addition to an analysis of voter turnout, <b>campaign</b> <b>expense,</b> municipal budget, and neighbourhood demographic data over 10 years to identify any patterns that may have arisen. The findings reveal that municipal government improved as a result of ward realignment, but the success of government is entirely dependent on the effectiveness of the representatives elected to office...|$|R
