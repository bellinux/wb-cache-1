5000|$|With {{the opening}} of the Meishin Expressway between Nagoya and Kobe in 1965 and the Tomei Expressway between Tokyo and Nagoya in 1968, JNR faced {{increasing}} competition for freight transport from road hauliers. JNR therefore developed the [...] "10000 series" [...] freight wagons (KoKi 10000 and KoKiFu 10000 <b>container</b> <b>flat</b> wagons, ReSa 10000 and ReMuFu 10000 refrigerated wagons, and WaKi 10000 bogie vans) capable of operating at 100 km/h. Express freight services formed of these wagons were introduced on the Tokaido Main Line and Sanyo Main Line from October 1966 using Class EF65-500 electric locomotives built in 1965. These locomotives were designed to be used in pairs hauling 1,000-tonne freight trains, but as pairs of locomotives drew excessive current from the overhead wires, 1,000-tonne freight trains had to be split into 600-tonne and 400-tonne sections when operating on the Sanyo Main Line. This led to the need for a new locomotive design that would be capable of hauling 1,000-tonne trains singly.|$|E

40|$|Since {{ordinary}} electrograms do {{not reveal}} electrical {{activity of the}} sinus node satisfac-torily, it is only with techniques employing microelectrodes that such activity may be faithfully disclosed. A number of workers, us-ing this method, have studied the genesis of spontaneous activity in the sinus node, but on-ly a few reports relating to the propagation of excitation from the node have appeared. Thus, Hoffman and Cranefield 1 and Paes de Carvalho- have described propagation from the sinus node to the atrioventricular node, but these reports include little information about passage of excitation from the sinus node to surrounding atrial muscle. One group of investigators including Horibe 8 and Miyau-chi 4 has studied this problem in detail. Never-theless, many important features of excitation in this region are not well known and this study was done to provide additional infor-mation on this problem. Methods The rabbit heart was isolated and placed in oxy-genated Tyrode solution kept at 35 °C in a glass <b>container.</b> <b>Flat,</b> thin, muscle strips of various sizes, including the sinus node, were excised from the heart and mounted in a muscle chamber. This was filled with about 40 to 50 ml of Tyrode solution, kept at 35 °C. Oxygen was constantly supplied to the Tyrode solution and muscle {{by means of a}} bubbling device in the chamber. In most of the experiments, two rigidly mount-ed microelectrodes were employed simultaneous-ly. One microelectrode was used to search for the sinus node and other particular points in its vicinity. The other microelectrode was used for time reference and was inserted into a convenient point, usually in the atrium near the sinus node. Attempts were made to keep this electrode at the same point throughout the experiment. To estimate the arrival time of the excitation wave at each point, the steepest rise of the actio...|$|E

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} Ramsey Cattle Mart {{specials}} and {{the transport of}} materials for projects such as the completion of an airfield {{in the north of}} the island, freight trains rarely operated. Most freight was conveyed by attaching freight wagons, loose coupled, to the rear of passenger trains. A practice that was contrary to UK regulations, but acceptable on the Isle of Man, due to its independent status. The consequent shunting often delayed passenger trains at intermediate stations, but was cost effective for the railway. A miscommunication while detaching a van from a Douglas train at Union Mills was a contributory factor to the 22 August 1925 accident at Douglas. Freight traffic ceased in the 1960s, as road transport was much more effective over the short distances on the Island. Ailsa's manager, Sir Philip Wombwell did try to bring container traffic to the railway in 1967/8 (Hendry and Hendry, op. cit.) and stripped 12 carriages from the F50-75 series of the bodies to act as <b>container</b> <b>flats.</b> The experiment proved to be unsuccessful as clearance issues prevented containers being carried north of Douglas, and the double transshipment of containers at Castletown - from ship to lorry and from lorry to train - made the traffic uneconomic. Some of the underframes from this project eventually found their way to the Ffestiniog Railway where they were placed on two foot gauge bogies and used as the basis for some of the [...] "Barn" [...] carriages running on the FR. A far more successful was a contract to haul oil between Peel and Milntown (Ramsey) for the Electricity Board. Three 'M' series wagons were fitted with tanks, and the oil was worked as tail traffic until passenger trains ceased in September.
