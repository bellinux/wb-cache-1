5|$|MD36 {{passes through}} the Georges Creek Valley, which {{has a long history}} of coal mining. In {{recognition}} of this, the MDSHA has designated MD36 as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway. Coal mining was a major industry in western Maryland in the 19th century, with railroads being the major route connecting the coal mines to markets outside the Georges Creek Valley. Deep mining, which was the primary mining method used in western Maryland, declined in use after World WarII, replaced primarily by surface mining. Although Maryland <b>coal</b> <b>production</b> is now only a small fraction of total U.S. <b>coal</b> <b>production,</b> coal from the Georges Creek Valley is used to power the AES Warrior Run power plant in Cumberland.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As the low safety {{production}} {{level and}} efficiency greatly restrict the efficient functioning of <b>coal</b> mine <b>production</b> logistics in our country, it is urgently necessary to combine with the complex feature of <b>coal</b> mine <b>production</b> logistics to evaluate its internal control. First, {{on the basis}} of management entropy and management dissipative theory, this paper expounds the evolution rules of <b>coal</b> mine <b>production</b> logistics internal control. Second, establish a set of index system reflecting the internal control system of <b>coal</b> mine <b>production</b> logistics and build the evaluation model of <b>coal</b> mine <b>production</b> logistics internal control based on management entropy. At last, verify the applicability of the model through empirical research, and provide a theoretical basis for the comprehensive analysis of the whole operation status and internal control problems in <b>coal</b> mine <b>production</b> logistics system...|$|R

5|$|From the 18th century onwards, Royton's {{economy was}} closely tied {{with that of}} Britain's textile {{manufacture}} during the Industrial Revolution, particularly the cotton spinning sector. However, Royton also lies on the Oldham Coalfield, and coal mining had an economic role for the area in {{as early as the}} 17th century. Mining peaked in the 19th century with over 200collieries in the town. Royton's pits were prone to repeated flooding, and owners began to close them. <b>Coal</b> <b>production</b> began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry, with the last pit closing in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge's economy {{developed}} from drift mines opened by Nicholas Sheran in 1874 and the North Western Coal and Navigation Company in 1882. North Western's president was William Lethbridge, from whom the city derives its name. By {{the turn of}} the century, the mines employed about 150 men and producing 300 tonnes of coal each day. In 1896, local collieries were the largest coal producers in the Northwest Territories, with production peaking during World War I. An internment camp was set up at the Exhibition Building in Lethbridge from September 1914 to November 1916. After the war, increasing oil and natural gas production gradually replaced <b>coal</b> <b>production,</b> and the last mine in Lethbridge closed in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{generally}} {{performed well}} {{at the end of}} the medieval period, helped by buoyant demand for manufactured and luxury goods. Cornish tin production plunged during the Black Death itself, leading to a doubling of prices. Tin exports also collapsed catastrophically, but picked up again over the next few years. By the turn of the 16th century, the available alluvial tin deposits in Cornwall and Devon had begun to decline, leading to the commencement of bell and surface mining to support the tin boom that had occurred in the late 15th century. Lead mining increased, and output almost doubled between 1300 and 1500. Wood and charcoal became cheaper once again after the Black Death, and <b>coal</b> <b>production</b> declined as a result, remaining depressed for the rest of the period – nonetheless, some <b>coal</b> <b>production</b> was occurring in all the major English coalfields by the 16th century. Iron production continued to increase; the Weald in the South-East began to make increased use of water-power, and overtook the Forest of Dean in the 15th century as England's main iron-producing region. The first blast furnace in England, a major technical step forward in metal smelting, was created in 1496 in Newbridge in the Weald.|$|E

5|$|By 1987 Pittston Coal {{had dropped}} {{from being the}} seventh largest coal {{operator}} in the United States to the 15th, and <b>coal</b> <b>production</b> was at an all-time low. The Pittston Coal Company had worked with the Bituminous Coal Operators (BCOA), which regulated health and retirement benefits offered to Pittston workers. The Pittston mines continued to lose money, though, and in 1987 the Pittston Coal Company terminated its contract with the BCOA to establish its own health and retirement benefit contract with the UMWA. Through collective bargaining, the UMWA and the Pittston Coal Company established two different retirement plans for the miners: one for those who retired before 1974 and one for those who retired after 1974, {{in the hopes that}} this would help the company gain a profit.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh coal {{industry}} employed 1,500 workers in 1800; {{and as the}} industry expanded, the workforce rose to 30,000 by 1864, and to 250,000 by 1913. As employment became available, many people moved {{to the area of}} the South Wales Coalfield; between 1851 and 1911 the population increased by 320,000. By 1913 the Welsh collieries were extracting 56.8million long tons of coal (63.6million short tons) a year, up from 8.5million long tons (9.5million short tons) in 1854; collieries in the region mined a fifth of all coal produced in the UK, and employed a fifth of its miners in the mid-nineteenth century.

5|$|In 1874–75, {{after labor}} unrest {{disrupted}} <b>coal</b> <b>production,</b> the Union Pacific Coal Department hired Chinese laborers {{to work in}} their coal mines throughout southern Wyoming. Even so, the Chinese population rose slowly at first; however, where there were Chinese immigrants, they were generally concentrated in one area. At Red Desert, a remote section camp in Sweetwater County, there were 20 inhabitants, of whom 12 were Chinese. All 12 were laborers who worked under an American foreman. To the east of Red Desert was another remote section camp, Washakie. An American section foreman lived there amongst 23 others, including 13 Chinese laborers and an Irish crew foreman. In the various section camps along the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad, Chinese workers far outnumbered any other nationality. Though the 79 Chinese in Sweetwater County in 1870 represented only 4% of the total population, they were, again, concentrated. In Rock Springs and Green River, the largest towns along the UP line, there were no Chinese residents reported in 1870.|$|E

Moreover, the impulse response analysis confirmed that the impact of coal usage on GDP and employment was generally negative.
