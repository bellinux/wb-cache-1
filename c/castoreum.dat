5|$|In May 2008, a joint {{application}} {{submitted by}} the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) and the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) {{was approved by the}} Scottish Government allowing for a trial reintroduction of the European beaver to the Knapdale Forest in Mid-Argyll. If the trial is successful then the European beaver will be the first mammal to be reintroduced to the United Kingdom. Beavers have been extinct in Scotland since the 16th century, when they were hunted for their pelt, meat and medicinal properties (use of <b>castoreum).</b>|$|E
5|$|The Fringe {{division}} tracks down {{a series}} of deaths of wives shortly after the passing of their respective husbands. Discovering traces of the husbands' DNA on {{the bodies of the}} wives, Walter Bishop (John Noble) suspects that the killer is using pheromones taken from the husbands to get close to the wives, using the substances as a perfume. Further identifying <b>castoreum</b> within the pheromone mix, they identify the murderer as Anson Carr (Michael Massee), a former and disgruntled employee of a perfume company inflicted with a rare skin disease. They arrive at Carr's home to find another husband, already dead, in a dehydration chamber, and race to protect his wife, Dianna (Ona Grauer). When no attack comes at the wife, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) realizes that her husband may have been having an affair, and races to the mistress' home, stopping Carr before he can kill her. As he is taken away, he admits he was trying to discover what love was, scientifically, so that he could reproduce it and allow the entire world to share in it.|$|E
25|$|European beavers (Castor fiber) were {{eventually}} hunted nearly to extinction {{in part for}} the production of <b>castoreum,</b> which was used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic. <b>Castoreum</b> was described in the 1911 British Pharmaceutical Codex for use in dysmenorrhea and hysterical conditions (i.e. pertaining to the womb), for raising blood pressure and increasing cardiac output. The activity of <b>castoreum</b> has been credited to the accumulation of salicin from willow trees in the beaver's diet, which is transformed to salicylic acid and has an action very similar to aspirin. <b>Castoreum</b> continues to be used in perfume production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Castoreum</b> {{can be used}} as an {{enhancer}} of vanilla, strawberry and raspberry flavorings. It {{is sometimes}} added to frozen dairy, gelatins, candy, and fruit beverages. Due to the difficulty and expense in obtaining <b>castoreum,</b> it is only very rarely used in common food products.|$|E

25|$|The beaver's fur {{consists}} of long, coarse outer hairs and short, fine inner hairs (see Double coat). The fur has {{a range of}} colors, but usually is dark brown. Scent glands near the genitals secrete an oily substance known as <b>castoreum,</b> which the beaver uses to waterproof its fur.|$|E
25|$|Beavers {{maintain}} and defend territories, which are areas for feeding, nesting and mating. They invest much energy in their territories, building their dams and becoming {{familiar with the}} area. Beavers mark their territories by constructing scent mounts made of mud, debris and <b>castoreum,</b> a urine based substance excreted through the beavers castor sacs between the pelvis and base of the tail. These scent mounts are established {{on the border of}} the territory. Once a beaver detects another scent in its territory, finding the intruder takes priority, even over food.|$|E
25|$|Both beaver {{testicles}} and <b>castoreum,</b> a bitter-tasting secretion with {{a slightly}} fetid odor contained in the castor sacs of male or female beaver, have been articles of trade for use in traditional medicine. Yupik medicine used dried beaver testicles like willow bark to relieve pain. Dried beaver testicles were also used as contraception. Beaver testicles were used as medicine in Iraq and Iran during the tenth to nineteenth century. Aesop's Fables comically describes beavers chewing off their testicles to preserve themselves from hunters, which is not possible because the beaver's testicles are inside its body. This belief, also recorded by Pliny the Elder, persisted in medieval bestiaries.|$|E
2500|$|Territorial Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) {{presented}} with a two-way choice sniffed both <b>castoreum</b> and anal gland secretion from a stranger longer than from a neighbour. [...] Furthermore, beavers responded aggressively (stood on the mound on their hind feet, pawing and/or overmarking) longer to <b>castoreum,</b> but not to anal gland secretion, from a stranger than from a neighbour. When the mounds containing the scents were allowed to remain overnight and the beavers' responses measured the following morning, the beavers' responses were stronger to both <b>castoreum</b> and anal gland secretion from a stranger than from a neighbour.|$|E
2500|$|Philosopher Gary Steiner {{argues that}} it is not {{possible}} to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are [...] "deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society". Animal products in common use include albumen, allantoin, beeswax, blood, bone char, bone china, carmine, casein, <b>castoreum,</b> cochineal, elastin, emu oil, gelatin, honey, isinglass, keratin, lactic acid, lanolin, lard, rennet, retinol, shellac, squalene, tallow/sodium tallowate, whey and yellow grease. Some of these are chemical compounds that can be derived from animal products, plants, or petrochemicals. Allantoin, lactic acid, retinol and squalene, for example, can be vegan. These products and their origins are not always included in the list of ingredients.|$|E
2500|$|The beaver {{was trapped}} out and almost extirpated in North America because its fur and <b>castoreum</b> were highly sought after. The beaver furs {{were used to}} make {{clothing}} and beaver hats. In the United States, extensive trapping {{began in the early}} 17th century, with more than 10,000 beaver per year taken for the fur trade in Connecticut and Massachusetts between 1620 and 1630. From 1630 to 1640, around 80,000 beavers were taken annually from the Hudson River and western New York. From 1670 onwards, the Hudson's Bay Company sent two or three trading ships into the bay every year to take furs to England from Canada. Archaeological and historical evidence suggests that beaver ponds created [...] "moth-hole like" [...] habitats in the deciduous forest that dominated eastern North America. This nonforest habitat attracted both Native American and early colonial hunters to the abundant fish, waterfowl, and large game attracted to the riparian clearings created by these aquatic mammals. The first colonial farmers were also attracted to the fertile, flat bottomlands created by the accumulated silt and organic matter in beaver ponds.|$|E
2500|$|The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) {{was nearly}} hunted to {{extinction}} in Europe, both for fur and for <b>castoreum,</b> a secretion from its scent gland {{believed to have}} medicinal properties. However, the beaver is now being re-introduced throughout Europe. Several thousand live on the Elbe and the Rh√¥ne and in parts of Scandinavia. A thriving community lives in northeast Poland, and the Eurasian beaver also returned to the Morava River banks in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. They have been reintroduced in Scotland (Knapdale), Bavaria, Austria, Netherlands, Serbia (Zasavica bog), Denmark (West Jutland) and Bulgaria and are spreading to new locations. The beaver became extinct in Great Britain in the sixteenth century: Giraldus Cambrensis reported in 1188 (Itinerarium ii.iii) that {{it was to be}} found only in the Teifi in Wales and in one river in Scotland, though his observations are clearly second hand. In 2001, Kent Wildlife Trust successfully introduced a family of beavers at Ham Fen, the last remaining ancient fenland in the county close to the town of Sandwich; these are now established and are breeding. In October 2005, six Eurasian beavers were reintroduced to Britain in Lower Mill Estate in Gloucestershire; in July 2007 a colony of four Eurasian beavers was established at Martin Mere in Lancashire, and a small population of probably Eurasian beavers is being monitored in Devon. [...] A trial re-introduction occurred in Scotland in May 2009. Feasibility studies for a reintroduction to Wales are at an advanced stage and a preliminary study for a reintroduction of beavers to the wild in England has recently been published.|$|E

60|$|With some animals, as {{with the}} notorious skunk of America, the {{overwhelming}} odour which they emit appears to serve exclusively as a defence. With shrew-mice (Sorex) both sexes possess abdominal scent-glands, and {{there can be little}} doubt, from the rejection of their bodies by birds and beasts of prey, that the odour is protective; nevertheless, the glands become enlarged in the males during the breeding-season. In many other quadrupeds the glands are of the same size in both sexes (9. As with the <b>castoreum</b> of the beaver, see Mr. L.H. Morgan's most interesting work, 'The American Beaver,' 1868, p. 300. Pallas ('Spic. Zoolog.' fasc. viii. 1779, p. 23) has well discussed the odoriferous glands of mammals. Owen ('Anat. of Vertebrates,' vol. iii. p. 634) also gives an account of these glands, including those of the elephant, and (p. 763) those of shrew-mice. On bats, Mr. Dobson in 'Proceedings of the Zoological Society' 1873, p. 241.), but their uses are not known. In other species the glands are confined to the males, or are more developed than in the females; and they almost always become more active during the rutting-season. At this period the glands {{on the sides of the}} face of the male elephant enlarge, and emit a secretion having a strong musky odour. The males, and rarely the females, of many kinds of bats have glands and protrudable sacks situated in various parts; and it is believed that these are odoriferous.|$|E
60|$|Those who are {{acquainted with}} the {{existing}} systems of medical education will observe that, long as is the catalogue of studies which I have enumerated, I have omitted to mention several that enter into the usual medical curriculum of the present day. I have said not a word about zoology, comparative anatomy, botany, or materia medica. Assuredly this is from no light estimate of the value or importance of such studies in themselves. It may {{be taken for granted}} that I should be the last person in the world to object to the teaching of zoology, or comparative anatomy, in themselves; but I have the strongest feeling that, considering the number and the gravity of those studies through which a medical man must pass, if he is to be competent to discharge the serious duties which devolve upon him, subjects which lie so remote as these do from his practical pursuits should be rigorously excluded. The young man, who has enough {{to do in order to}} acquire such familiarity with the structure of the human body as will enable him to perform the operations of surgery, ought not, in my judgment, to be occupied with investigations into the anatomy of crabs and starfishes. Undoubtedly the doctor should know the common poisonous plants of his own country when he sees them; but that knowledge may be obtained by a few hours devoted to the examination of specimens of such plants, and the desirableness of such knowledge is no justification, to my mind, for spending three months over the study of systematic botany. Again, materia medica, so far as it is a knowledge of drugs, is the business of the druggist. In all other callings the necessity of the division of labour is fully recognised, and it is absurd to require of the medical man that he should not avail himself of the special knowledge of those whose business it is to deal in the drugs which he uses. It is all very well that the physician should know that castor oil comes from a plant, and <b>castoreum</b> from an animal, and how they are to be prepared; but for all the practical purposes of his profession that knowledge is not of one whit more value, has no more relevancy, than the knowledge of how the steel of his scalpel is made.|$|E
