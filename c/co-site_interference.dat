50|$|Early {{practical}} {{examples of}} the technology used discharge tubes to contain the plasma and {{are referred to as}} ionized gas plasma antennas. Ionized gas plasma antennas can be turned on and off and are good for stealth and resistance to electronic warfare and cyber attacks. Ionized gas plasma antennas can be nested such that the higher frequency plasma antennas are placed inside lower frequency plasma antennas. Higher frequency ionized gas plasma antenna arrays can transmit and receive through lower frequency ionized gas plasma antenna arrays. This means that the ionized gas plasma antennas can be co-located and ionized gas plasma antenna arrays can be stacked. Ionized gas plasma antennas can eliminate or reduce <b>co-site</b> <b>interference.</b> Smart ionized gas plasma antennas use plasma physics to shape and steer the antenna beams without the need of phased arrays. Satellite signals can be steered and/or focused in the reflective or refractive modes using banks of plasma tubes making unique ionized gas satellite plasma antennas. The thermal noise of ionized gas plasma antennas is less than in the corresponding metal antennas at the higher frequencies. Solid state plasma antennas (also known as plasma silicon antennas) with steerable directional functionality that can be manufactured using standard silicon chip fabrication techniques are now also in development. Plasma silicon antennas are candidates for use in WiGig (the planned enhancement to Wi-Fi), and have other potential applications, for example in reducing the cost of vehicle-mounted radar collision avoidance systems.|$|E
40|$|Developments of {{frequency}} reconfigurable antennas in the wireless communication systems have attracted {{a lot of}} attention recently. Most reported antennas have narrowband to narrowband reconfiguration and multiband to multiband reconfigurations. In this research, a slot dipole antenna has been introduced with the ability to produce a multiband to narrowband reconfiguration. This type of antenna can suppress the problem of <b>co-site</b> <b>interferences.</b> Thus, two types {{of frequency}} reconfigurable antennas are studied and discussed which are switchable and tunable multiband antennas. The switchable multiband antenna is reconfigured by using Radio Frequency (RF) switches. The proposed antenna is capable to reconfigure from multiband to dual and/or single band. By having seven configurations of switches, this antenna can operate at 2. 4 GHz, 3. 5 GHz and/or 5. 2 GHz. The antenna is able to have three states of single-band, three states of dual-band and one state of tripleband. Meanwhile, the tunable multiband antenna is reconfigured by using variable capacitors. The proposed antenna is capable to have a wide frequency tunability range for dual or single band operation (1. 5 GHz - 4. 5 GHz, ratio of 3 : 1). Each antenna has been successfully designed, fabricated and tested. The simulation and measurement results were analysed and presented in terms of reflection coefficient, radiation pattern and gain. The simulation and measurement results have been compared and a very good agreement was achieved. The reflection coefficient average accuracies of 98 % has been achieved. These proposed antennas are suitable for future multi-mode applications such as cognitive radio systems...|$|R
30|$|Various channel {{assignment}} schemes {{have been widely}} investigated with a goal to maximize the frequency reuse. The {{channel assignment}} schemes in general can be classified into three strategies: fixed channel assignment (FCA), dynamic channel assignment (DCA) and the hybrid channel assignment (HCA) [4, 5]. In FCA, a set of channels are permanently allocated to each cell based on pre-estimated traffic intensity. In this case, the co-channel interference (Transmission on same frequency), adjacent channel interference (Transmission on close frequencies), and the <b>co-site</b> channel <b>interference</b> lead to the main problem, i.e., it does not adapt to changing traffic conditions and user distribution. Moreover, the frequency planning becomes more difficult in a microcellular environment as {{it is based on}} the accurate knowledge of traffic and interference conditions. The main problem of FCA is the poor channel utilization wherein some users are unable to find any channel to use.|$|R
30|$|The overall {{objective}} is to serve the maximal number of network users over limited transmission resources. The transmission resource is an available radio spectrum which consists of {{a limited number of}} frequencies or (channels). Channel assignment problem involves assigning frequencies to each radio cell {{in such a way that}} a set of constraints is satisfied [13]. These include the limited number of available frequencies in the radio spectrum as well as the traffic constraints corresponding to the minimum number of frequencies indispensable for covering communication between mobile devices moving in a particular cell. In addition, the electromagnetic compatibility constraints (EMC) may happen between channels in the same cell (<b>co-site</b> channel constraint), <b>interference</b> between neighboring cells (adjacent channel constraint) and interference between other cells utilizing the same channel (co-channel constraint) [14].|$|R
40|$|With the {{increase}} {{of the number of}} radios and antennas on today’s systems, the risk of <b>co-site</b> <b>interference</b> is very high.

The thesis investigates some features of a radio system, like antenna types, receiver parameters, intermodulation products and isolation, and suggests how this knowledge can be used to minimize the risk of <b>co-site</b> <b>interference.</b> The goal is to maximize the isolation between the antennas, by good frequency planning, the use of filters and taking great care in antenna placement. A first version of an analysis software was developed where transmitters and receivers can be paired and evaluated. An intermodulation product calculator was also implemented, to easily find which products are an issue and where they originate. The goal of the software is to be simple to use and easy to adapt to different setups and situations. It should also be easy to upgrade with new features...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} provide for the safe {{integration}} of unmanned aircraft systems into the National Airspace System, the control and non-payload communications (CNPC) link connecting the ground-based pilot with the unmanned aircraft must be highly reliable. A specific requirement is that it must operate using aviation safety radiofrequency spectrum. The 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC- 12) provided a potentially suitable allocation for LOS CNPC spectrum in C-Band at 5030 - 5091 MHz band which, when combined with a previous allocation in L-Band (960 - 1164 MHz) may satisfy the LOS spectrum requirement and provide for high reliability through dual-band redundancy. However, the LBand spectrum hosts a number of aeronautical navigation systems which require high-power transmitters on-board the aircraft. These high-power transmitters co-located with sensitive CNPC receivers operating in the same frequency band have the potential to create <b>co-site</b> <b>interference,</b> reducing the performance of the CNPC receivers and ultimately reducing the usability of the L-Band for CNPC. This paper examines the potential for <b>co-site</b> <b>interference,</b> as highlighted in recent flight tests, and discusses the impact on the UAS CNPC spectrum availability and requirements for further testing and analysis...|$|E

40|$|The current {{air traffic}} {{management}} (ATM) system in civil aviation is globally standardized, well-established and highly reliable. However, it still relies on techniques which have been developed several decades ago. With the continuously and rapidly growing demand for air transportation, it is predicted that the ATM system will reach its capacity limit in the near future. A major ATM modernization process including communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS) technologies is currently ongoing under SESAR in Europe and NextGen in the US. For the future aeronautical communications, analog voice shall be replaced by digital data to support more complicated information exchange as well as higher capacity. L-band Digital Aeronautical Communication System (LDACS) is the proposal for the future ATM data link. In this system, multicarrier OFDM signals with 500 kHz effective bandwidth per channel are used for transmission. With respect to aeronautical navigation, the performance and capacity of the legacy systems, e. g. distance measurement equipment (DME), are limited {{and will not be}} able to catch up with the growing demand for higher precision and more efficient flight-route management. The future navigation system will heavily rely on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Despite the far superior performance, the main concerns for the satellite-based approach are availability, continuity and integrity. The fundamental problem for satellite-based systems is the weak receiving power because of the large distance between the satellites and the aircraft. As a result, the satellite-based navigation system can be easily interfered, either intentionally or unintentionally. There is a need for a parallel backup navigational infrastructure to ensure availability, continuity and integrity. This backup is commonly referred to as alternative positioning, navigation and timing (APNT). The solutions for APNT are mostly ground-based systems as the sources of error would be different from that of satellite-based systems. Intensifying and enhancing the already existing DME system is the most commonly discussed and most-ready solution. The major drawback of this solution is that DME is using the precious aeronautical spectrum very inefficiently. Intensifying DME usage would even increase this inefficiency and would finally block the L-band spectrum for any other future CNS system â€“ a consequence which shall be considered thoroughly. Aiming at efficient spectrum usage, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has proposed to consider LDACS as APNT solution. Although the LDACS system is primarily designed for communications, the navigational function can be added without any major modifications. The network of LDACS ground stations can be used as pseudolites for estimating the aircraft positions. Additionally, LDACS has capability to be operated in parallel with DME, and therefore it is possible to combine the range calculation from both systems. Two LDACS flight trials to assess the usability of the system as APNT solution were conducted by DLR in November 2012 and November 2013. The goal of the first campaign was to implement a core structure of the LDACS system for navigation and test its performance in a realistic scenario with an airborne receiver. The results confirmed that the LDACS signal is a good ranging source for navigation. Multipath propagation and <b>co-site</b> DME <b>interference</b> were identified as significant factor on the performance. More understanding of their impact in different scenarios and developing techniques for mitigating these effects can significantly improve the ranging performance. As a result, the second measurement campaign was performed in November 2013. This contribution will focus on the measurement setup and the LDACS ranging results from this campaign. In this campaign, only one ground station (LDACS transmitter) was considered, therefore the results are assessed by ranging performance. The main goal was to verify the LDACS ranging performance in diverse flight scenarios. Several flight scenarios such as flying in different altitudes from FL 100 to FL 380, circling around the ground station in low altitude and flying in a strong in-band DME interference environment were performed with the measurements aircraft (LDACS receiver). The LDACS ranging performance is analyzed based on the measurement data and several mitigation techniques are investigated. We propose particle filtering and the Doppler smoothing filter to improve the ranging performance as well as mitigating the interference from the multipath propagation and DME. The results show that the proposed algorithms can greatly improve the ranging performance with reasonable computational complexity...|$|R
40|$|The communications, {{navigation}} and surveillance (CNS) technologies in {{air traffic management}} for civil aviation are currently undergoing a major modernization process. The legacy systems, which were established over several decades ago, such as analog voice communication systems, distance measuring equipment (DME) and VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) may not meet the continuously growing demands in the near future. In communications, L-band digital aeronautical communication system – type 1 (LDACS 1) {{is one of the}} most promising candidates for the future air traffic management data link. Using digital communication systems, more complex information can be exchanged between pilots and controllers as well as high-capacity data transfer can be achieved. In navigation, the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is foreseen to be the primary means for high precision {{navigation and}} complex flight trajectories. However, there are still concerns about possible GNSS outages due to intentional or unintentional interference. As a result, a parallel backup navigational infrastructure commonly-referred to as alternative positioning navigation and timing (APNT) is needed. The proposed APNT solutions mainly focus on utilizing ground-based navigational systems because their source of errors would be different from that of GNSS. Several works have been done on the extension of LDACS 1 functionality toward navigation and surveillance, and the LDACS 1 system has been proposed as one of the APNT solutions. The LDACS 1 system was not primarily designed for ranging application but only a few minor modifications are needed to exploit its navigation functionality. LDACS 1 is a ground-based cellular system. The networks of LDACS 1 ground stations can be used for an aircraft to estimate its position using trilateration. At the moment, enhancing and intensifying the use of the DME system is the most favoured solution for APNT. The major disadvantages for this option are the cost of installing additional DME infrastructure and its inefficient use of L-band spectrum. One of the advantages of using LDACS 1 as APNT is that the deployment of LDACS 1 ground stations is planned for the future aeronautical communication systems, and navigational functionality can be added without installing any additional infrastructure. Another key advantage of LDACS 1 is its spectral deployment, the LDACS 1 signal has 500 kHz effective bandwidth and is planned to be allocated in the same frequency band as DME, i. e. the lower part of L-band (960 - 1164 MHz), using inlay approach. The 500 kHz LDACS 1 channels will be placed in the 1 MHz spectral gaps between two adjacent DME channels. The LDACS 1 system is planned to be able to work in parallel with DME, and therefore both systems can work together as APNT solutions by combining the range calculation in the situations where either of the systems does not have a sufficient number of ground stations available. It is important to ensure the good performance for both systems and several studies on this topic are ongoing. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) has conducted two measurement campaigns in 2012 and 2013 to assess the usability of the LDACS 1 system as APNT solution. Several flight scenarios were performed to evaluate the LDACS 1 ranging performance and the analysis of the measurement data gave the conclusion that LDACS 1 signals offer an excellent ranging source [1], [2]. One of the measurement scenarios recorded during the 2013 measurement campaign focused on the impact of DME interference on the LDACS signals. During this scenario, the measurements aircraft (LDACS 1 receiver) flew at FL 250 directly over a testing DME station. To test the feasibility of LDACS 1 inlay deployment, similar flight route was flown twice and the DME channel is tuned to 500 kHz and then 1. 5 MHz away from the tested LDACS 1 carrier frequency. Different signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can be observed along the flight paths. Additionally, the <b>co-site</b> DME <b>interference,</b> i. e. the interrogating DME signal transmitted from the aircraft, were visible at the receiver in most of the flight scenarios. This event occurred with a very low duty cycle but the damage to LDACS 1 received signal can be very severe as the on-board DME transmitted power is much higher than the LDACS 1 received power from the ground. The worst case scenario occurs when the LDACS 1 received signal is heavily faded due to banking as the view of the LDACS 1 receiving antenna was blocked. The LDACS 1 ranging performance with the presence of DME interference is analyzed based on the measurement data and mitigation techniques are investigated. The in-band DME interference can be suppressed using methods based on pulse blanking. These methods have been studied and proved to be effective for the interference mitigation in the case of LDACS 1 communication systems [3]. In this work similar approaches are adopted for the LDACS 1 ranging applications. Since the LDACS 1 ranging errors caused by DME interference occur in bursts with low duty cycle, the ranging algorithms that accommodate prior information in the range estimation are suitable methods to suppress this type of error bias. In this work, we propose the use of particle filtering and Doppler smoothing filter for the DME interference mitigation. Particle filtering is a variant of sequential Bayesian filter where the dynamic of the estimated parameters is taken into account in the estimation. Doppler smoothing filter is one interpretation of a well-known Hatch filter. This method uses the Doppler information to smooth the raw LDACS 1 range estimates from maximum likelihood algorithm or particle filtering and, as a result, sudden error bursts can be suppressed.

40|$|Scope and Pln'pose [...] -With the {{enormous}} growth of mobile communication demands, the frequency spectrum {{is becoming a}} more scarce resource. Hence, it is a vital issue to use the spectrum more efficiently. An efficient way of increasing frequency spectrum utilization in a mobile communication network is the cellular structure approach which divides spatially geographical region {{into a number of}} cells. This approach makes the reuse of frequency spectrum possible, and thus an efficient method of reusing the spectrum is essential. In fact, for a fixed frequency spectrum assigned and a specific multiplexing technology used, the traffic carrying capacity of a cellular radio network depends on how the spectrum is reused in different cells. In this article, we suggest two heuristic algorithms to efficiently reuse the frequency spectrum efficiently. Abstract [...] In this article, two efficient heuristic algorithms are suggested for the channel allocation problem which minimizes the average blocking probability of the whole network subject to the co-ebannel, adjacent-site and <b>co-site</b> <b>interference</b> constraints, given the number of available channels. We convert this problem into a convenient form using the piecewise linearization technique and the concept of pattern, and apply Lagrangean relaxation and subgradient optimization techniques. Computational experiments show that this procedure provides bigh-qnality solutions with information about their error ranges for networks with special competibility matrices. We also suggest a general procedure using a GOS (grade of service) updating scheme, and provide encouraging computational results. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd 1...|$|E
