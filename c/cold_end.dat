5|$|For {{much of the}} Middle Ages, England's climate {{differed}} from that in the 21st century. Between the 9th and 13th centuries England went through the Medieval Warm Period, a prolonged period of warmer temperatures; in the early 13th century, for example, summers were around 1°C warmer than today and the climate was slightly drier. These warmer temperatures allowed poorer land to be brought into cultivation and for grapevines to be cultivated relatively far north. The Warm Period was followed by several centuries of much cooler temperatures, termed the Little Ice Age; by the 14th century spring temperatures had dropped considerably, reaching their coldest in the 1340s and 1350s. This <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> to the Middle Ages significantly affected English agriculture and living conditions.|$|E
5|$|The AV-8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack {{aircraft}} {{of metal}} and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with horizontal stabilizers and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent anhedral (downward slope). The aircraft {{is powered by a}} single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine. Two of these nozzles are located near the forward, <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> of the engine and two are near the rear, hot end of the engine. This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine nozzles only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller valve-controlled nozzles in the nose, tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.|$|E
5|$|The liquid thermal {{diffusion}} process {{was based on the}} discovery by Carl Ludwig in 1856 and later Charles Soret in 1879, that when a temperature gradient is maintained in an originally homogeneous salt solution, after a time, a concentration gradient will also exist in the solution. This is generally known today as the Soret effect. David Enskog in 1911 and Sydney Chapman in 1916 independently developed the Chapman–Enskog theory, which explained that when a mixture of two gases passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier gas tends to concentrate at the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> and the lighter gas at the warm end. This was experimentally confirmed by Chapman and F.W. Dootson in 1916.|$|E

5|$|The thermal {{diffusion}} process was based on Sydney Chapman and David Enskog's theory, which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> and the lighter one at the warm end. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this {{can be used as}} a means of isotope separation. This process was first demonstrated by H. Clusius and G. Dickel in Germany in 1938. It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.|$|E

25|$|The gamma {{configuration}} has two cylinders: one {{containing a}} displacer, {{with a hot}} and a <b>cold</b> <b>end,</b> {{and one for the}} power piston; they are joined to form a single space with the same pressure in both cylinders; the pistons are typically in parallel and joined 90 degrees out of phase on a crankshaft.|$|E

30|$|The {{performance}} of our nano-submicron-stripe dual-beam Pd sensors is further verified on a testing platform. To avoid temperature increase at the <b>cold</b> <b>ends</b> of the sensors while applying heating {{power at the}} sensing region, ideally, the <b>cold</b> <b>ends</b> should be {{far away from the}} hot zone. Also, on one measurement chip, a sensor array should be fabricated to allow multiple measuring spots. These two requirements lead to a large size of the testing platform. To reduce the cost and fabrication complexity, we have used a hybrid process that combines electron-beam lithography and photolithography techniques for patterning the wafer-size platform with nano-submicron sensors.|$|R

25|$|The beta {{configuration}} has {{a single}} cylinder with a hot end and a <b>cold</b> <b>end,</b> containing a power piston and a 'displacer' that drives the gas between the hot and cold ends. It is typically used with a rhombic drive to achieve the phase difference between the displacer and power pistons, {{but they can be}} joined 90 degrees out of phase on a crankshaft.|$|E
25|$|To summarize, the Stirling engine {{uses the}} {{temperature}} difference between its hot end and <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> {{to establish a}} cycle of a fixed mass of gas, heated and expanded, and cooled and compressed, thus converting thermal energy into mechanical energy. The greater the temperature difference between the hot and cold sources, the greater the thermal efficiency. The maximum theoretical efficiency is equivalent {{to that of the}} Carnot cycle, but the efficiency of real engines is less than this value because of friction and other losses.|$|E
25|$|A beta Stirling has {{a single}} power piston {{arranged}} within the same cylinder on the same shaft as a displacer piston. The displacer piston is a loose fit and does not extract any power from the expanding gas but only serves to shuttle the working gas between the hot and cold heat exchangers. When the working gas is pushed to the hot end of the cylinder it expands and pushes the power piston. When it is pushed to the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> of the cylinder it contracts and {{the momentum of the}} machine, usually enhanced by a flywheel, pushes the power piston the other way to compress the gas. Unlike the alpha type, the beta type avoids the technical problems of hot moving seals, as the power piston is not in contact with the hot gas.|$|E
40|$|Silicide {{formation}} of wires during hot-wire {{chemical vapor deposition}} (HWCVD) of silicon based coatings is a key challenge which has to be overcome before HWCVD can be transferred successfully into industry. Silicide {{formation of}} tungsten wires is not occurring at temperatures of approximately 1900 degrees C and above when maintaining a silane partial pressure below approximately 1 Pa. Proceeding silicide formation at the <b>cold</b> <b>ends</b> where the wires are electrically contacted was completely prevented by continuously moving the <b>cold</b> <b>ends</b> of the wires into the hot deposition zone, resulting in a retransformation of the tungsten phase. Thus the maintenance period of a HWCVD manufacturing tool can be freed from wire lifetime...|$|R

England's environment continued to be shaped throughout the period, through the building of dykes to drain marshes, tree clearance and the large scale extraction of peat. Managed parks for hunting game, including deer and boars, were built as status symbols by the nobility from the twelfth century.|$|E
2500|$|Broadly, modern glass {{container}} factories are three-part operations: the batch house, the hot end, and the <b>cold</b> <b>end.</b> The batch house handles the raw materials; the hot end handles the manufacture proper — the forehearth, annealing ovens, and forming machines; and the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> handles the product-inspection and [...] -packaging equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Glass {{containers}} typically receive two surface coatings, {{one at the}} hot end, {{just before}} annealing and one at the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> just after annealing. At the hot end a very thin layer [...] of tin(IV) oxide is applied either using a safe organic compound or inorganic stannic chloride. Tin based systems {{are not the only}} ones used, although the most popular. Titanium tetrachloride or organo titanates can also be used. In all cases the coating renders the surface of the glass more adhesive to the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> coating. At the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> a layer of typically, polyethylene wax, is applied via a water based emulsion. This makes the glass slippery, protecting it from scratching and stopping containers from sticking together when they are moved on a conveyor. The resultant invisible combined coating gives a virtually unscratchable surface to the glass. Due to reduction of in-service surface damage, the coatings often are described as strengtheners, however a more correct definition might be strength-retaining coatings.|$|E

30|$|Another {{potential}} {{problem is that}} the temperature rises in the <b>cold</b> <b>ends</b> of TFTCs. In a TFTC built-in IC chip, because of the excellent thermal conductivity of silicon substrate when the IC circuit has been run for a long time, joule heat generated from the running current may heat up the entire chip, causing a remarkable rise of temperature at the <b>cold</b> <b>ends</b> of the TFTCs, thus causing a huge error in temperature readings. It seems that in this case, on-chip sensors of diodes or transistors can provide better temperature reading [24]. However, there are at least four defects which limit the development of these methods and why many endeavors were made in developing new ways of temperature sensing in IC chips.|$|R
2500|$|The primary {{effect of}} {{regeneration}} in a Stirling engine {{is to increase}} the thermal efficiency by 'recycling' internal heat that would otherwise pass through the engine irreversibly. As a secondary effect, increased thermal efficiency yields a higher power output from a given set of hot and <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> heat exchangers. These usually limit the engine's heat throughput. In practice this additional power may not be fully realized as the additional [...] "dead space" [...] (unswept volume) and pumping loss inherent in practical regenerators reduces the potential efficiency gains from regeneration.|$|E
2500|$|The {{division}} of the MAUD Committee at Liverpool was led by Chadwick, who was assisted by Frisch, Rotblat, Gerry Pickavance, Maurice Pryce and John Riley Holt. The division at Liverpool also controlled a small team at the nearby University of Bristol that included Alan Nunn May and Cecil Frank Powell. At Liverpool they focused on the separation of isotopes through thermal diffusion as was suggested in the Frisch-Peierls memorandum. The {{was based on the}} fact that when a mixture of two gases passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier gas tends to concentrate at the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> and the lighter gas at the warm end. That this can be used as a means of isotope separation was first demonstrated by Klaus Clusius and Gerhard Dickel in Germany in 1938, who used it to separate isotopes of neon. They used an apparatus called a [...] "column", consisting of a vertical tube with a hot wire down the centre. The advantage of the technique was that it was simple in design and there were no moving parts. But it could take months to reach equilibrium, required a lot of energy, and needed high temperatures that could cause a problem with the uranium hexafluoride.|$|E
60|$|I {{made the}} last of my journey in the <b>cold</b> <b>end</b> of December, in a mighty dry day of frost, and who should be my guide but Patey Macmorland, brother of Tam! For a tow-headed, bare-legged brat of ten, he had more ill tales upon his tongue than ever I heard the match of; having drunken betimes in his brother's cup. I was still not so old myself; pride had not yet the upper hand of curiosity; and indeed it would have taken any man, that cold morning, to hear all the old clashes of the country, and be shown all the places by the way where strange things had fallen out. I had tales of Claverhouse as we came through the bogs, and tales of the devil as we came {{over the top of the}} scaur. As we came in by the abbey I heard {{somewhat}} of the old monks, and more of the free-traders, who use its ruins for a magazine, landing for that cause within a cannon-shot of Durrisdeer; and along all the road the Duries and poor Mr. Henry were in the first rank of slander. My mind was thus highly prejudiced against the family I was about to serve, so that I was half surprised when I beheld Durrisdeer itself, lying in a pretty, sheltered bay, under the Abbey Hill; the house most commodiously built in the French fashion, or perhaps Italianate, for I have no skill in these arts; and the place the most beautified with gardens, lawns, shrubberies, and trees I had ever seen. The money sunk here unproductively would have quite restored the family; but as it was, it cost a revenue to keep it up.|$|E
