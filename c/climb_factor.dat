50|$|In February 1951, it {{went down}} at Richmond, Virginia, and was badly damaged. Again, in February 1962, the {{aircraft}} crashed. In March 1977, the aircraft suffered yet another crash. According to the summarized National Transportation Safety Board narrative from report number SEA77FYE12:There were 2 fatalities. Incident occurred at 13:46 hours. The airframe was destroyed. Incident occurred at Olympia Municipal Airport, Olympia, Washington. The aircraft Ground looped or water swerved during the takeoff run. Stalled or mushed during the initial <b>climb.</b> The <b>factors</b> included; unapproved modification. FAA examiner remarks include: Partially completed dual control modification.|$|R
50|$|An alpine {{grading system}} {{adapted from the}} grades used in the Aoraki/Mt Cook Region is widely used in New Zealand for alpine routes in the North and South islands. Grades {{currently}} go from 1-7. The grading system is open ended; harder <b>climbs</b> are possible. <b>Factors</b> which determine grade are (in descending order of contributing weight): technical difficulty, objective danger, length and access.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Many {{natural areas}} {{are now in}} the process of {{developing}} cliibing management plans in order-to control management factors associated with the growth of rock <b>climbing.</b> These <b>factors</b> may include limiting areas of use and limiting the type of climber utilizing the resource. The purpose of this study was to further develop and operationalize the concept of recreation specialization as it relates to rock climbing. This study also examined preferences for the physical characteristics of rock climbing routes and the general recreational setting. Management implications of this study include the development of a heuristic management tool to categorize and rate climbers into a continuum of specialization from general to specific users that in turn would display different environmental preferences for the environment in which the sport of rock climbing takes place...|$|R
40|$|One-sided {{variations}} on path length in a trie (a sort of digital trees) are investigated: They include imbalance <b>factors,</b> <b>climbing</b> under different strategies, and key sampling. For the imbalance factor accurate asymptotics for the mean are derived for a randomly chosen {{key in the}} trie via poissonization and the Mellin transform, and the inverse of the two operations. It is also shown from {{an analysis of the}} moving poles of the Mellin transform of the poissonized moment generating function that the imbalance factor (under appropriate centering and scaling) follows a Gaussian limit law. The method extends to several variations of sampling keys from a trie and we sketch results of climbing under different strategies. The exact probability distribution is computed in one case, to demonstrate that such calculations can be done, at least in principle...|$|R
40|$|The Motivation to Mountain Climbing and Mountaineering The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{investigate}} motivational aspects of mountaineering the most successful Czech mountainners today, and compare these results with international research, undertaken in the past. Furthermore, we focused on Measuring motivation to exercise and its comparison {{with the kinds of}} motives. Methods: In our work we chose the method of controlled polostrukturovan√©ho interview together with a standardized questionnaire survey questionnaire LMI (motivation to power). The results were statistically processed in Microsoft Excel Results: We found that the motivation for <b>climbing</b> affects five <b>factors,</b> which are partially carbonated external incentives and partly by internal motives. These factors are called "Experience," "attractiveness," "Quality of climbing activities," "rivalry" and "Social recognition". These factors include your own motivational categories that have been more specific. Furthermore, we found that climbing activity shows signs of volitional processes, the state of "flow" while we measured a high degree of motivation to perform. Key words: Mountaineering, Performance, Motivation, Will, Ris...|$|R
2500|$|The second {{incident}} occurred on 20 July 1975. It involved {{another of the}} company's Handley Page Dart Heralds (registration: G-APWF) in a runway accident while departing London Gatwick on a scheduled flight to Guernsey. According to eye-witness reports, the aircraft lifted off from runway 26 after a ground run of [...] and appeared airborne for [...] with its landing gear retracting before the rear underside of the fuselage settled back on to the runway. None of the 45 occupants, including the 41 passengers who were safely evacuated via the aircraft's crew entrance door by the two cabin crew members on the instructions of the flight's commander, were hurt in that accident. The subsequent investigation concluded that this accident had been caused by the landing gear being retracted before the aircraft had been properly established in its initial <b>climb.</b> Other contributory <b>factors</b> included a mistaken wing flap configuration and the resulting inadequate airspeed at rotation. The aircraft itself sustained substantial damage and required extensive repairs {{in order to be}} restored to an airworthy condition.|$|R
40|$|A method {{employed}} in the simulation of jettison of stores from aircraft involving small scale wind-tunnel drop tests from {{a model of the}} parent aircraft is described. Proper scaling of such experiments generally dictates that the gravitational acceleration should ideally be a test variable. A method of introducing a controllable artificial component of gravity by magnetic means has been proposed. The use of a magnetic artificial gravity facility based upon this idea, in conjunction with small scale wind-tunnel drop tests, would improve the accuracy of simulation. A review of the scaling laws as they apply to the design of such a facility is presented. The design constraints involved in the integration of such a facility with a wind tunnel are defined. A detailed performance analysis procedure applicable to such a facility is developed. A practical magnet configuration is defined which is capable of controlling the strength and orientation of the magnetic artificial gravity field in the vertical plane, thereby allowing simulation of store jettison from a diving or <b>climbing</b> aircraft. The <b>factors</b> involved in the choice between continuous or intermittent operation of the facility, and the use of normal or superconducting magnets, are defined...|$|R
40|$|Some basic {{concepts}} of physiology {{are presented in}} relation to bean cultivation, and the external and internal factors affecting crop development and production are described: the environment (edaphic and climatic factors), photosynthesis and factors that affect it (light, CO 2, O, temp., wind and water) photorespiration and photoperiod. In beans a great variation exists between the different lines and var. {{with regard to their}} response to the photoperiod. Adaptation is determined by: (a) insensitivity to the photoperiod, (b) a stable growth habit, (c) insensitivity to temp. during flowering, (d) drought tolerance, and (e) tolerance to excess moisture. Growth habits in beans are determinate, indeterminate, semi-climbing indeterminate and <b>climbing</b> indeterminate. Other <b>factors</b> are described such as the period of growth and development (emergence, appearance of the 1 st trifoliated leaf, flowering, complete flowering, beginning of pod formation, development of the bean and maturity). Yield components (morphological, physiological, leaf area and LAD) and simplified yield, including biological and economic yield and growth, are analyzed. Abscission is studied by plant maps and 3 ideotypes are proposed to improve yields by the selection of desirable morphological and physiological characters. (CIAT...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for climbing-related injuries of the upper extremities in recreational climbers. A total of 426 recreational climbers were recruited from indoor climbing halls. The baseline questionnaire included questions on potential risk <b>factors</b> for <b>climbing</b> injuries: personal <b>factors,</b> climbing-related factors and upper extremity injuries that had occurred in the previous 12 months. Follow-up questionnaires collected information on new injuries that occurred during the follow-up period. The incidence of climbing-related injuries during one-year follow-up was 42. 4 % with 13 injuries per 1000 h of climbing. The finger was the most frequently affected injury location (36. 0 %). The following risk factors were associated with the occurrence of upper extremity injuries: higher age (OR 1. 03, 95 %CI 1. 01; 1. 05), performing a cooling-down (OR 2. 02, 95 %CI 1. 28; 3. 18), climbing with campus board (OR 2. 48, 95 %CI 1. 23; 5. 02), finger strength middle finger (OR 1. 12, 95 %CI 1. 05; 1. 18) and previous injuries (OR 3. 05, 95 %CI 2. 01; 4. 83). Climbing injuries of the upper body extremities are very common among recreational climbers in indoor halls and several risk factors can be identified that are related to a higher injury risk...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to determine}} the type of best plants vine of the long pepper as cuttings material and {{to determine the}} effectiveness of cow urine fertilizer in improving growth of cuttings. Research conducted {{during the dry season}} 2008 in the Demangan village Bangkalan district with 20 - 50 m height above sea level (asl), 25 - 33 o C temperature and soil pH 5, 5 - 6, 5. Research designed factorial, consisting of 2 factors and 3 times replications using Random Design Group. The first factor is the type of vine cuttings consisting of: soil vine cutting (S 1), climbing vine cuttings (S 2), fruit vine cutting (S 3) and the second factor is the application of cow urine fertilizer consisting of: no cow's urine (P 0), fresh cow's urine (P 1), cow urine was fermented with EM 4 (P 2) each with a dose of 2 ml/ 20 ml water / plant given every 2 weeks until the cuttings was 12 weeks after planting (MST). The observed parameters include the bud emerge, amount of leaves and leaf area of plants, amount of roots and total plant dry weight. The results showed that th ere are interaction s between the 2 factors tested against the number of roots and total plant dry weight, leaf area parameters are influenced only by vine cuttings type while the bud emerge and amount of leaves was not influenced by either <b>factor.</b> <b>Climbing</b> vine cuttings is the best type of long pepper vine because it has the highest leaf area, amount of roots and total dry weight. Cow urine fertilizer g iving positive effect on the growth of cuttings, which fermented cow urine have better effect than fresh cow urine. </span...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{has sought to}} shed light on decision making among climbing groups while on expedition by identifying and correlating the major factors that affect it. Perspectives from the psychology of group dynamics and decision-making provide the theoretical basis for investigation. All data were gathered from climbers during actual mountain expeditions. The study is thus a naturalistic one rather than being laboratory based. The main study investigated young mountain climbers from the standpoint of how they perceived themselves and how they perceived the operation of the whole group of which they were a member. A picture was constructed on the basis of three factors: Incentive or what draws the climber to the top; Risk, or what limits the response to that incentive, and Situation, or what real world constraints are operative at the time. To provide a psychological profile of the climber while actually undertaking an expedition an intervention method of data gathering was implemented. This consisted of questions administered on four occasions: one: while still at base "setting out"; two: "en route" after {{a significant part of the}} expedition had been completed; three: on the summit, or when the objective or goal had been achieved, and four: when the group had returned to base. Subjects were between the ages of 13 years to 18 years from 14 schools. Data were collected over a period of 10 weeks during weeklong residential outdoor activity courses. A comparison of ratings of the three concepts, Risk, Incentive, and Situation over the stages of the climb both for the Individual and the Group highlighted several findings: 1. Climbers' feelings about the strength/importance of risk acceptance and of incentive concepts increased as the climb progressed, but dipped at the completion of the <b>climb.</b> Situational <b>factors</b> varied throughout the climb. 2. The climbers backgrounds had varying influences on their responses across the climb. Some explanatory variables, such as level of experience, ability and fitness provided no differentiation, while others such as group status, commitment, risk level and weather conditions made a consistent contribution. 3. Individuals perceived the group's point of view differently from their own. 4. Incentive, risk and situational similarities between stages for climbers' own ratings varied in strength across the climb. 5. The predictions of responses for the next stage were consistently underestimated or at least mis-estimated, and seemed bound by current - state responses. 6. These predictions were particularly adrift for risk and incentive, though fairly accurate for situational factors. 7. The evaluations made about the group were consistently higher throughout the climb than the evaluations made by climbers about themselves showing that the group was perceived to have higher incentive levels and was more willing to take risks than the individual...|$|R
