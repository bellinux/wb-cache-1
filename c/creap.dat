CRH is a hormone that is involved in the timing of labour, therefore investigation of its regulation is of importance in understanding human parturition. The CRE is a central regulatory element on the CRH promoter and in investigating proteins that bind to this element a novel protein was discovered. <b>CREAP</b> or cAMP Regulatory Element Associated Protein, was initially discovered by its ability to bind to the CRE. Its sequence encodes a unique set of modular domains including two zinc fingers, two leucine zippers, two coiled-coils and an RS-rich domain. These domains point to functions in both DNA binding/transcription and RNA splicing, with the leucine zippers being characteristic of bZIP transcription family and the RS domain characteristic of the SR Protein family of splicing factors, to represent a new protein family. In this thesis, molecular reagents were produced for the study of <b>CREAP</b> together with a polyclonal antibody. This antibody was used in western blotting to detect a 58 kDa full-length <b>CREAP</b> protein and a shorter 25 - 30 kDa truncated splice variant. <b>CREAP</b> was localised to the nucleus and to intranuclear splicing speckles, with co-localisation and co-immunoprecipitation with the splicing factor SC 35, strongly suggesting a role in splicing. To test the transcriptional activity of <b>CREAP,</b> specifically if it regulates CRH expression, luciferase reporter studies were conducted. However, <b>CREAP</b> showed negligible effect on CRH or CRE promoter activities suggesting that it is not involved in CRH regulation. <b>CREAP</b> did however react with a large number of transcription factors in an in vitro assay, mostly from the bZIP and zinc finger families. siRNA mediated knockout of <b>CREAP</b> was conducted and the effect on genome-wide expression analysed using a microarray. <b>CREAP</b> knockdown caused an over-representation of genes from the protein transport, metabolism, signal transduction and transcription factor processes. Overall, <b>CREAP</b> appears to be a multifunctional protein that is ubiquitously expressed, and is involved in both splicing and transcriptional processes...|$|E
40|$|S. Vattam (Under the {{direction}} of Donald Nute) The central theme {{of this research is}} simple: people are able to cope with complexities of the real world because of their ability to improvise, which makes them more flexible and adaptable. Most artificial intelligence systems are rigid, do not scaleup to challenges of the real world, and do not exhibit improvisational behavior. If we acknowledge the benefits of improvisation methods for people, then we can also acknowledge that similar benefits apply to artificial intelligence systems. Therefore, if we can build systems that can improvise we are better-off. Based on this simple theme, we have proposed a novel architecture that combines a traditional planner with an analogy-based improvisation component in order to craft planning systems that respond intelligently in complex and little-known environments. <b>CREAP</b> (CREative Action Planner) is an intelligent agent embodying our architecture. Situated in a simulated environment of its own, <b>CREAP</b> is designed to plan and act in ways that achieve certain prespecified goals. Experiments conducted on <b>CREAP</b> show that our architecture is capable of producing improvisational behavior, thus lending flexibility to our agent in responding to less familiar situations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{contains}} {{a case study}} describ-ing {{the development of a}} software tool to prove a con-cept for use in design to inventory scenarios. The tool was developed by Master’s students at the University of South Australia. The case study, designed as a reference for similar activities in other academic institutions, con-tains a list of lessons learned on the project. All the lessons learned {{have to do with the}} non-technical as-pects of the project. Even though the project was small, many of the attributes of large projects were seen. BACKGROUND Today’s requirements engineering processes do not have very effective checks to ensure that system re-quirements are feasible. In the main, this is because the feasibility of requirements is governed by domain knowledge (application or technology) which is lacking in the writers of the requirements. The Communications Requirements Evaluation & Assessment Prototype (<b>CREAP)</b> project constructed a prototype software package that provided a tool that was able to integrate military communications domain expertise and re-quirements engineering practice in order to ensure the feasibility of requirements imposed on communications systems. The <b>CREAP</b> is an implementation of a subsection of the Frame-Based Approach to Requirements Engineer-ing (FIBRET) initiative at the Systems Engineering an...|$|E

So that problems such as stress corrosion, cracking and fatigue of steam turbine casing, In this work the thermo mechanical analysis of steam turbine casing will be established by finite element method. In this work the temperature and stress distributions for turbine inner casing were calculated by finite element analysis. The three dimensional model of the Steam Turbine Casing was created using the CATIA software. The model was meshed using software HYPERMESH.
