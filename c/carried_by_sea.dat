About 90% of its trade {{with the rest of}} the world is <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea</b> and around 40% of its internal trade is <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea.</b> The EU has a coastline twice that of Russia and three times that of the US so it is acutely aware of maritime safety and environmental issues.

50|$|In the {{building}} of the line, its designers did not pay much attention {{to the needs of the}} territory through which it was built but instead mainly took into account military considerations and the political purposes of the new Kingdom of Italy. As most transport in the area, both passenger and freight was mainly <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea,</b> the selected route ran virtually at sea level, closely following the coast and, where possible the Via Aurelia, linking more than 40 villages that had previously been difficult to reach by land. In 1885, the line was integrated into the new Società per le Strade Ferrate del Mediterraneo (Mediterranean System), which was taken over by the Ferrovie dello Stato in 1905.|$|E

[...] About {{a quarter of all}} oil <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea</b> passes through the Strait, mainly from Persian Gulf suppliers to Asian markets. In 2007, an estimated 13.7 million barrels per day were transported through the strait, increasing to an estimated 15.2 million barrels per day in 2011. In addition, {{it is also one of}} the world's most congested shipping choke points because it narrows to only 2.8 km (1.5 nautical miles) wide at the Phillips Channel (close to the south of Singapore).|$|E

50|$|The {{case for}} Shisr being Omanum Emporium has been {{questioned}} by recent research. Nigel Groom commented in an article “Oman and the Emirates in Ptolemy's Map” published in 2007, that Ptolemy’s map of Arabia contained many wild distortions. The word “Emporium” in the original Greek meant a place for wholesale trade of commodities <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea,</b> and was sometimes an inland city where taxes were collected and trade conducted. Thus the term {{could be applied to}} a town that was some distance from the coast. This, Groom suggests, may have been the case with Ptolemy’s ’Omanum Emporium’. He suggested that the Hormanus River, the source of which is marked on Ptolemy’s map as being north-east of Omanus Emporium, was in fact the Wadi Halfrain which rises some 20 kilometres north east of Izki in modern-day central Oman. Thus, Groom concludes, Omanum Emprorium was likely to have been located at Izki, possibly Nizwa, or in their vicinity.|$|E

5000|$|At common law, when {{goods are}} <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>sea</b> by a “common carrier” (a public carrier), then, if the {{contract}} of carriage does not contain an exception clause relating to seaworthiness, there is an absolute undertaking that the vessel is seaworthy. Liability is “strict”**, meaning the carrier is liable {{even in the absence}} of negligence, as in Liver Alkali v Johnson. This does not mean the vessel need be capable of encountering any peril. The test of seaworthiness may be [...] "that the ship should be in a condition to encounter whatever perils of the sea a ship of that kind, and laden in that way, may be fairly expected to encounter in the voyage to be performed". However, the strict liability at common law is invariably modified in contracts of affreightment. In charter parties the shipowner may negotiate an express clause excluding his liability for unseaworthiness or he may, as it more usual, agree to incorporate the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 into the charter.|$|E

50|$|A {{dangerous}} task <b>carried</b> out <b>by</b> <b>Sea</b> Kings was {{to act as}} decoys, {{to deflect}} sea-skimming missiles away from surface ships. This was achieved by hovering close to the ship and as the radar seeker could not resolve targets in azimuth, the ship/helicopter combination appeared as a single target. If the helicopter was not too high the missile guidance system would aim for the centroid of its apparent target and hopefully pass between the two. Prince Andrew at one point flew his helicopter as an Exocet missile decoy. Chaff rockets aim to seduce a missile with a similar technique by increasing the apparent length of the target.|$|R
