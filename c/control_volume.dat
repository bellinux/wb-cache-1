25|$|The law of {{moment of}} {{momentum}} states that {{the sum of the}} moments of external forces acting on a fluid which is temporarily occupying the <b>control</b> <b>volume</b> is equal to the net change of angular momentum flux through the <b>control</b> <b>volume.</b>|$|E
25|$|Conservation of momentum: Newton's second law {{of motion}} {{applied to a}} <b>control</b> <b>volume,</b> is a {{statement}} that any change in momentum of the fluid within that <b>control</b> <b>volume</b> will {{be due to the}} net flow of momentum into the volume and the action of external forces acting on the fluid within the volume.|$|E
25|$|For example, the {{assumption}} that mass is conserved means that for any fixed <b>control</b> <b>volume</b> (for example, a spherical volume) – enclosed by a control surface – {{the rate of change}} of the mass contained in that volume is equal to the rate at which mass is passing through the surface from outside to inside, minus the rate at which mass is passing from inside to outside. This can be expressed as an equation in integral form over the <b>control</b> <b>volume.</b>|$|E

However, for some typical discharge demand change operating conditions of canal, if the <b>controlled</b> <b>volume</b> algorithm of whole canal pool is still adopted, then it certainly will cause some unnecessary regulation, and consequently increases the disturbed canal reaches. Therefor, the idea of <b>controlled</b> <b>volume</b> operation method of continuous canal pools was proposed, and its algorithm was designed. Through simulation to practical project, the results indicate that the new <b>controlled</b> <b>volume</b> algorithm proposed for typical operating condition can comparatively obviously reduce the number of regulated check gates and disturbed canal pools for some typical discharge demand change operating conditions of canal, thus the control efficiency of canal system was improved.

According to critics, the album's five major producers (Large Professor, DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Q-Tip and L.E.S) extensively {{contributed to the}} cohesive atmospheric aesthetic that permeated the album, while still retaining each's individual, trademark sound.' For instance, DJ Premier's production on the album is noted by critics for his minimalist style, which featured simple loops over heavy beats. Charles Aaron of Spin wrote of the producers' contributions, [...] "nudging him toward Rakim-like-rumination, they offer subdued, slightly downcast beats, which in hip hop today means jazz, primarily of the '70s keyboard-vibe variety". Q magazine noted that [...] "the musical backdrops are razor sharp; hard beats but with melodic hooks and loops, atmospheric background piano, strings or muted trumpet, and samples ...

30|$|In {{our case}} the {{transition}} from the beam model to the Cosserat continuum is on a local scale. First we map, in an energetically consistent manner that assumes the Cosserat continuum structure, the stress and deformation fields on the discrete beam level onto spatially continuous fields defined on <b>control</b> <b>volumes</b> that are characteristic of the particular microstructure. Determination of stresses and deformations is independent, and elastic constants are identified by seeking an optimum match between stress and conjugate strain variables through linear mappings on average over the ensemble of local <b>control</b> <b>volumes.</b> The approach {{used in the present study}} is contingent upon several conditions. (i) The material of the beam system must be isotropic. This is, for instance, not the case for an additively manufactured cellular structure where the deposition process imposes a preferential direction on the matrix material. (ii) The geometry of the individual <b>control</b> <b>volumes</b> (the cells) must be statistically isotropic. This feature is inherent in our construction of the beam network, which is based upon an isotropic honeycomb reference structure from which irregular structures are obtained via radial displacements of the cell seeds. (iii) The correlations between different <b>control</b> <b>volumes</b> must be statistically isotropic. In our construction of the beam network this is ensured by making the displacements of the cell seeds statistically independent and isotropic. (iv) There are no long-ranged geometrical correlations in the beam network. In fact, our construction method for the beam structure ensures that the shape fluctuations of different <b>control</b> <b>volumes</b> shapes are mutually uncorrelated beyond the nearest neighbors. This absence of correlations ensures that we can infer directly from the local behavior to the system scale behavior – which would be impossible if geometrical correlations between different <b>control</b> <b>volumes</b> were present.|$|R

The “nozzle” has time-varying geometry and is modeled to allow transition from choked to non-choked flow. The well-filling process is modeled via expansion of the compressed gas from the high-pressure reservoir into the well through this “nozzle. ” When the pressures in the well and reservoir equalize, the “passive” part of the compression process is taken to be complete. At this point, the gas in the well {{is assumed to be}} fully-mixed and the two <b>control</b> <b>volumes</b> are subsequently considered as one. Then the “active” part of compression takes place.

2500|$|In {{elementary}} {{fluid mechanics}} utilizing ideal gases, a shock wave {{is treated as}} a discontinuity where entropy increases over a nearly infinitesimal region.
