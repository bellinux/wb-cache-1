5|$|<b>Charitable</b> trusts in English law are {{a form of}} {{express trust}} {{dedicated}} to <b>charitable</b> goals. There {{are a variety of}} advantages to <b>charitable</b> trust status, including exception from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust. To be a valid <b>charitable</b> trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a <b>charitable</b> purpose and a public benefit. Applicable <b>charitable</b> purposes are normally divided into categories for public benefit including the relief of poverty, the promotion of education, the advancement of health and saving of lives, promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by the law. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.|$|E
5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; <b>charitable</b> trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have {{purposes}} that are not <b>charitable</b> (unless these are ancillary to the <b>charitable</b> purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for <b>charitable</b> trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. <b>Charitable</b> trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries. This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a <b>charitable</b> trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E

5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show <b>charitable</b> intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general <b>charitable</b> intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and <b>charitable</b> intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E

5|$|Tax {{law also}} makes special {{exemptions}} for <b>charitable</b> trusts. They are {{free from the}} income tax paid by individuals and companies, and also the corporation tax paid by incorporated and unincorporated associations. There is no requirement for <b>charitable</b> trusts to pay capital gains tax or council tax, although they are obliged to pay VAT. This freedom from tax liability applies not just to <b>charitable</b> trusts, but also to people who donate to them. Individuals who donate via Gift Aid are free from paying tax on that amount, while companies who give gifts to charity can claim tax on the amount back from HM Revenue & Customs.|$|E

5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} {{is the idea}} that, where a <b>charitable</b> trust's purposes are impossible or cannot be fulfilled for whatever reason, the funds should be reapplied to purposes {{as close as possible}} to the trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the trustees, either to the High Court of Justice or the Charity Commission. This doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy près comme possible (as close as possible), It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; <b>charitable</b> gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the <b>charitable</b> gift failed, this would not be guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the testator's original goals.|$|E
5|$|The group {{retains a}} high profile largely because of their {{outrageous}} costumes, {{but also because of}} their frequent work for <b>charitable</b> organizations. The Hogettes have appeared in a national advertising campaign for VISA, and they provide support for many charities, including Children's Miracle Network, Ronald McDonald House, and March of Dimes. They have raised over US$100 million for these and other <b>charitable</b> causes. Despite their philanthropic work, the Hogettes are disliked by some and have even been attacked by fans of opposing teams.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard express trust has a relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries; this does not apply to <b>charitable</b> trusts, partially because of the special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual beneficiaries identified in a <b>charitable</b> trust. Instead, the Attorney General of England and Wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce a <b>charitable</b> trust. Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; the beneficiaries have no direct control. <b>Charitable</b> trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the rule against perpetuities. The trustees are also not required to act unanimously, only with a majority.|$|E

5|$|United in Charity, a general, {{unrestricted}} endowment fund, {{was introduced}} at the 2004 Supreme Council meeting {{to support and}} ensure the overall long-term <b>charitable</b> and philanthropic goals of the Order.
