500|$|The first step, {{where the}} wort is {{prepared}} by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, {{is known as}} [...] "mashing". Hot water (known as [...] "liquor" [...] in brewing terms) is mixed with <b>crushed</b> <b>malt</b> or malts (known as [...] "grist") in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in {{a process known as}} [...] "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} ordered by Samuel Whitbread in 1784 {{to replace a}} horse wheel at the Chiswell Street {{premises}} of his London brewery. It was installed in 1785, the second steam engine to be installed in a brewery, and enabled Whitbread to become the largest brewer in Britain. The horse wheel was retained for many years, serving as a backup in case the steam engine broke down.The drive gear of the engine, still evident today, was connected {{to a series of}} wooden line shafts which drove machinery within the brewery. Connected machinery included rollers to crush malt; an Archimedes' screw, that lifted the <b>crushed</b> <b>malt</b> into a hopper; a hoist, for lifting items into the building; a three-piston pump, for pumping beer; and a stirrer within a vat. There was also a reciprocating pump connected to the engine's beam, used to pump water from a well to a tank {{on the roof of the}} brewery.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ingredients}} used are: equal {{measures of}} maize meal, <b>crushed</b> mealie <b>malt</b> (corn <b>malt)</b> and <b>crushed</b> sorghum <b>malt.</b> The maize malt provides a lighter-toned beer with a mellower flavour. The sorghum malt provides a darker beer.|$|R
50|$|Juniper {{is used in}} the {{traditional}} farmhouse ales of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. In Norway, the beer is brewed with juniper infusion instead of water, while in the other countries the juniper twigs are mainly used in the mash, as filters to prevent the <b>crushed</b> <b>malts</b> from clogging the outlet of the mashing tun.|$|R
50|$|Advanced homebrewers {{forgo the}} use of {{concentrated}} extract and instead extract sugars from the grains themselves. The wort is made by making a mash from <b>crushed</b> <b>malted</b> barley (or alternative grain adjuncts such as unmalted barley, wheat, oats, corn or rye) and hot water. This requires a vessel known as a mash tun, which is often insulated. The process {{is often referred to}} as all grain brewing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{watermill}} was {{in operation}} from 1784 to 1895 or 1896 for <b>crushing</b> <b>malt</b> and {{to power the}} pumps throughout the manufacturing and storage complex. It had a far more limited life as a cornmill for grinding wheat, from 1784 to about 1798, as recorded by the wife and mother of the owners, the diarist Mary Hardy. [...] Briefly a ginger beer factory from 1896 to 1906, the complex then ceased all manufacturing. It was converted to housing 2013-15.|$|R
50|$|The saddle quern is {{produced}} by rocking or rolling the handstone using parallel motions (i.e., pushing and pulling the handstone), which forms a shape looking like a saddle. These are the most ancient and widely used type of quern-stone. The handstones for saddle querns are generally either roughly cylindrical (not unlike a rolling pin) and used with both hands, or rough hemispheres and used with one hand. This provides a crushing motion, not a grinding action and is more suitable for <b>crushing</b> <b>malted</b> grain. It {{is not easy to}} produce flour from a saddle quern with unmalted grain. The handstone is also referred to as a 'rubber' or 'mouler'.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally Eskimo lollies {{or fruit}} puffs are used, which are like firm, but soft and chewy marshmallows. Chopped lollies {{are added to}} the base mixture, which {{consists}} of <b>crushed</b> plain <b>malt</b> biscuits combined with melted butter and sweetened condensed milk. The mixture is usually pressed into a log shape and rolled in coconut, and then refrigerated until set and sliced. Other ingredients can be added or substituted. Lolly cakes are very similar to the Northern Ireland traybake confections known as fifteens.|$|R
40|$|<b>Crushing</b> the <b>malted</b> grain in {{the process}} of milling enables {{extractive}} substances of malt to become available for water which accelerates dissolving and other chemical and physical processes during the time of mashing. The aim of this work was at the basis of performed analyses to evaluate to what extent the grist composition with regard to different proportion of meal fraction affects the amount of extract and other technological parameters of malt. Analyzed malt was made from four varieties of malting barley as are Nitran, Ebson, Malz and Xanadu coming from the harvest year 2009. Composition of malt grist in great extent influenced the entire process of mashing, lautering and the amount of extract. The highest values of extract were measured by all varieties at the variant III. with the highest content (50 %) of the softest fraction meal + powder meal. The difference between variant I. with 10 % content of the softest fraction and variant III. with 50 % content, was already 3 %. The most significant increase of this parameter was found out by varieties Ebson and Malz. Mashing and lautering parameters have not been significantly influenced by the milling variants. More significant differences were found out with regard to wort turbidity. Only variety Malz showed out the turbidity up to 4 EBC units, measured by turbidity meter under the angle 90 Â°. The highest turbidity was measured by variant I. with the lowest proportion of the fraction meal + powder meal. doi: 10. 5219 / 111 </div...|$|R
