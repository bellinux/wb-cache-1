Increased dietary oxalate intake and/or intestinal absorption may provide the critical quantity of additional oxalate that triggers the formation of kidney stones. The accurate determination of food oxalate is highly dependent on oxalate extraction, the first step in oxalate analysis. Potential problems include the possibility of elevated oxalate due to in vitro conversion from various oxalate precursors such as ascorbate and failure to dissolve all pre-existing calcium oxalate crystals. The primary objective was to compare the efficiency of the hot and <b>cold</b> <b>extraction</b> methods in extracting oxalate from 50 dry herb and 10 fresh fruit samples.

Fatty acid lipid profiles were also determined by derivatisation of the fatty acids (FA) into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and analyzing them. The relative amounts were used to create the lipid profile. Comparison between ultrasonic bath <b>extraction</b> and <b>cold</b> column <b>extractions</b> were done and the results of the <b>cold</b> column <b>extractions</b> showed better recoveries than the USB extractions, while an USB extraction gives more uncertainties in the method due to lower recoveries and some cross contaminations in the method.

40|$|Special issueTannins {{have shown}} {{antifungal}} effects {{and have been}} considered a potential natural compound for wood preservation. Extracts produced from softwood bark contain both tannins and non-tannin compounds, which may reduce the effectiveness of tannin used as a wood preservative.

Different extraction and postextraction scenarios of tannin production are compared using the life-cycle assessment method.

The results show that the extract drying process is the primary contributor to the environmental impact of tannin production.
