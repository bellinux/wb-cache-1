5000|$|After the First World War, {{at the end}} of the Deutsche Zollverein, {{the local}} {{viniculture}} went into the decline, which lasted until well after the Second World War. To Ahn as well as the whole Moselle River Valley, land management played even greater its important role in the viniculture. The vintners had come to recognize that this might be their opportunity to set the quality as well as the quantity. For that, Ahn was already by the Fifties going through voluntary reorganization with the exchange of little parcels. So it was natural that the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vineyards</b> <b>of</b> Ahn was the first, which was realized by the <b>Consolidation</b> Act <b>of</b> 25 May 1964. For this consolidation to work, the whole zone had to be aligned. By the labors, which lasted for something like five years, the earth had to be moved and leveled, new roads had to be built with retaining walls, water pipes had to be installed for the total amount of 156 million francs. The partial planting of the new channels cost more than 618,000 francs per hectare, of which the National Agrarfong in Brussels, which had founded the Channel Construction Cooperative Riewenubau Genossenschaft specifically for that, paid a great part. The results were: ...|$|R
25|$|The early 20th century {{brought a}} period of much {{political}} and domestic instability in Portugal, continuing until the ascension of António de Oliveira Salazar as dictator of the Estado Novo or Second Republic of Portugal. During Salazar's 40-year reign, the entire Portuguese wine industry was revamped beginning with {{the founding of the}} Junta Nacional do Vinhos (JNV) in 1937. The JNV encouraged the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> small <b>vineyard</b> landowners into co-operative wine producers. While the rise of co-operatives brought more order and structure to the Portuguese wine industry, it also had the negative effect of curbing creativity and free enterprise. As co-operatives rose to nearly absolute power in several wine regions, the winemaking and hygiene standards of some of the more lax co-operatives declined, which cast a pale reputation on the whole of the Portuguese wine industry. The lone bright spot during this period was the international success of a style of mass-produced, sweet, slightly sparkling rosés that came out of Portugal. Following World War II, brands such as Mateus and Lancer marketed this style of wine to great success in British supermarkets and around the globe. Outside port, these wines also came to be readily associated with Portuguese wine.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> {{services}} {{is a widely}} accepted technique for IaaS Cloud providers to reducing energy consumption and improving the utilization of their resources. This technique is based on distributing all services in the minimum amount of servers. This way, the overall energy consumption of the datacenter is reduced, as less servers are needed to be active. Traditionally, {{research has focused on}} strategies for <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> Virtual Machines (VMs), but containers are changing the landscape of Cloud services. Containers are expected to optimize the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> services by reducing the amount of needed resources, thus allocating more services using less servers. However, while multiple research works have been produced in the Energy Efficiency (EE) achieved through <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> VMs, there is yet no experimental work on how <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers affects EE, when assuming a given Quality-of-Service (QoS) to the user. In this paper we show an experimental analysis on the effects <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers in the QoS and EE, compared to the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> VMs. We demonstrate that the <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> containers is indeed more optimal than the one of VMs, both in terms of QoS and EE. Consecutively, we analyze how the degradation of the service is produced both in QoS and EE, and we show how QoS is the variable which is more affected by consolidation. This work provides the necessary scientific background on <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> two widely used virtualization technologies, and we believe it is useful for future works on the optimization of resources in datacenters...|$|R
