40|$|Abstract Bone {{substitutes}} – In {{trauma and}} orthopedic surgery {{the use of}} autograft is a first choice therapy for filling bone defects. Due to drawbacks {{in the use of}} autografts (for example donor site morbidity and limited amount of bone tissue) there is an increasing interest in the use of (artificial) bone substitutes. This article provides an overview of the basic science of bone substitution. For optimal ingrowth of bone a transplant should have osteogenic, osteoinductive and osteoconductive characteristics. Bone substitutes are mostly osteoconductive and provide a scaffold for bone regeneration. Osteoconductivity is mainly determined by pore size, porosity and cristallinity. Calcium phosphates represent a group of bone substitutes that is being used mostly, and this group of products has been extensively studied.

Here, the effect of Ca(NO), Mg(NO), MgSO and CaSO on the surface properties of Cu-activated sphalerite was studied using contact angle (CA) measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and zeta potential measurements. The CA measurements show that the hydrophobicity of sphalerite developed after copper activation, but the presence of 30 mM Ca(NO) or Mg(NO) or MgSO decreased its hydrophobicity: CA reduced from 67 °to 48 °. The presence of 30 mM of Ca and SO ions in solutions reduced CA further to 42 °.

Zeta potential measurements confirmed the presence of calcium and magnesium ions on the sphalerite surface.

As minor species, they commonly contain reduced sulphur compounds (RSC) (sulfoxyanions with sulphur in the oxidation state below (VI) such as SO 32 -, S 2 O 32 -, S 2 O 52 -, and S 4 O 62 -), cations of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, frothing molecules, residual chemical reagents and products of their degradation. Tailing ponds also host communities of chemolithotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms which {{play an important role in}} dictating their aqueous and solid phase chemical speciation. Consequently, the key step towards developing scientific approaches of recycling of the tailing waters is elucidation of how, in what extent, and why the tailing water components, taken singly or jointly influence flotation of sulphides. In this work, the influence of main process water components of <b>calcium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> on chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrite flotation has been investigated through Hallimond flotation, zeta-potential and diffuse reflectance FTIR spectroscopy measurements using pure mineral samples as well as bench scale flotation tests using complex sulphide ore. The significance of process water species in flotation has been assessed using deionised water, process water and simulated water containing <b>calcium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> ions in experiments. In addition, the effect of temperature in bench scale flotation tests has also been examined. Hallimond flotation indicated depression of chalcopyrite, galena and sphalerite and activation of pyrite in the presence of <b>calcium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> ions with potassium amyl xanthate as collector. Calcium ions have significant influence on zeta-potential characteristics and xanthate adsorption behaviour of chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrite compared to sulphate ions. FTIR studies revealed the presence of surface oxidised sulfoxy species and surface iron and calcium carbonates on chalcopyrite in the presence of process water and water containing calcium ions, surface oxidised sulfoxy and carbonate species on galena in the presence of deionised water, process water and water containing <b>calcium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> ions, hydrated surface oxidised species and surface iron and calcium carbonates on pyrite in the presence of process water and water containing calcium ions all at pH 10. 5 in which the surface species influenced xanthate adsorption. The presence of surface oxidised sulfoxy and carbonate species on sphalerite were also revealed at pH 11. 5 in the presence of deionised water, process water and water containing <b>calcium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> ions in which surface species does not influence xanthate adsorption. Bench scale flotation using two different complex sulphide ores showed that chalcopyrite recovery is better in process water than tap water and general depression of chalcopyrite at temperatures lower than 22 oC in either tap water or process water, activation of chalcopyrite at all temperatures in process water and depression of chalcopyrite when tap water containing <b>calcium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> ions was used at 22 oC.
