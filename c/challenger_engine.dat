50|$|While {{attending}} the Naval Academy, Iwuji started drag racing at Capitol Speedway in Crofton, Maryland, driving a Chrysler 300. After his graduation from the Naval Academy, he raced a Dodge Challenger. Four years later, {{he participated in}} the Mojave Mile speed trial; for the event, he upgraded his <b>Challenger's</b> <b>engine</b> to a horsepower of 1,100. With the new engine, Iwuji ran at a speed of 200.9 mph, becoming the fifth modern Mopar driver to accomplish the feat at the Mojave Mile. Afterwards, he joined the Naval Postgraduate School staff in southern California, where {{he was involved in}} road racing - driving a Chevrolet Corvette - before making the transition to stock cars.|$|R
50|$|STS-51-L Mission {{timeline}} is {{a detailed}} timeline of events from the ignition of <b>Challenger's</b> main <b>engines</b> to the remote {{destruction of the}} two solid rocket boosters, and includes a transcript of crew conversations from the cockpit voice recorder on board the Orbiter.|$|R

5000|$|The Curtiss Robin, {{introduced}} in 1928, was a high-wing monoplane with a 90 hp (67 kW) OX-5 eight-cylinder engine {{built by the}} Curtiss-Robertson Airplane Manufacturing Company. It was later fitted with the more powerful <b>Challenger</b> <b>engine,</b> which developed between 170 and 185 hp (127 and 138 kW). NOTE: Model B (90 hp/67 kW Curtiss OX-5 engine), Model C-1 (185 hp/138 kW Curtiss <b>Challenger</b> <b>engine),</b> and Model J-1 (165 hp/123 kW Wright J-6 Whirlwind 5 engine) ...|$|E
50|$|Believing {{the design}} to have {{commercial}} potential, Curtiss developed the Model 51 {{as a civil}} equivalent powered by the less powerful Curtiss <b>Challenger</b> <b>engine.</b> The company operated 109 of these aircraft in its own air taxi service, the Curtiss Flying Service during the 1930s. A number of these aircraft were experimentally fitted with the same Wright engines used in their military counterparts as the J-1 and J-2, but these were not produced in quantity. Another experimental variant, the reduced-wingspan Fledgling Junior was produced {{to the extent of}} a single prototype only. A number of Model 51s were exported to foreign military services for evaluation: four to Canada and one to Czechoslovakia, but these did not lead to any purchases. Curtiss also delivered at least seven N2C-1 kits to Turkey in 1933, as part of an agreement to produce the Curtiss Hawk Model 35 under licence in Turkey. These N2C-1s were used as trainers and liaison aircraft by the Turkish Air Force until 1945. At least one N2C-1 is thought to have been given to Iran as a gift from the Turkish Air Force.|$|E

50|$|Named {{after his}} two sons (and a play on the Rolls-Royce name that meant quality products), this 2-seat biplane {{received}} US ATC number 323 in September 1929. the Ken-Royce was powered by a 170HP Curtiss <b>Challenger</b> radial <b>engine.</b> Only one known example of the type exists today.|$|R
50|$|While on the pad, {{problems}} were detected with <b>Challengers</b> main <b>engines</b> and repairs were begun. During this time, a severe storm caused contamination of TDRS-1 {{while it was}} in the Payload Change-out Room on the Rotating Service Structure at the launch pad. Consequently, the satellite had to be taken back to its checkout facility, where it was cleaned and rechecked. Challenger finally lifted off from Launch Complex 39A of the Kennedy Space Center at 18:30:00 GMT on April 4, 1983.|$|R
50|$|STS-51-F's first launch {{attempt on}} July 12, 1985 was halted with the {{countdown}} at Tâˆ’3 seconds after main engine ignition, when a malfunction {{of the number}} two Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) coolant valve caused the shutdown of all three main <b>engines.</b> <b>Challenger</b> launched successfully on its second attempt on July 29, 1985, at 17:00 EDT, after a delay of 1 hour 37 minutes due to {{a problem with the}} table maintenance block update uplink.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Challenger {{was built}} around a rectangular cross-section chrome-molybdenum steel frame and given an oval cross-section by bulkheads. The cabin region was plywood skinned; aft, formers and stringers were fabric covered. One of the three , six-cylinder Curtiss <b>Challenger</b> radial <b>engines</b> was in the nose under a wide-chord fairing. The other two were mounted uncowled on the wing bracing struts, assisted by more struts between engine and upper fuselage and others between the struts. The pilots occupied an enclosed cockpit, placed high and {{just ahead of the}} wing leading edge, with side-by-side seating and dual control. A passageway connected the cockpit and the windowed, well furnished passenger cabin. Cabin and cockpit were accessed by a door on the port side, equipped with a built-in ladder, via a compartment containing a curtained-off lavatory and a luggage space.|$|R
50|$|Vision Racing was a race team {{formerly}} having {{competed in}} the NASCAR Xfinity Series. The team currently fields the No. 17 Toyota Camry for Benny Gordon in the NASCAR Xfinity Series. The team previously used Dodge <b>Challenger</b> cars and <b>engines</b> previously run by Team Penske before 2012, as well as Toyotas from Joe Gibbs Racing. After Tanner Berryhill failed to qualify Daytona Xfinity race in 2015, the team decided to shut down {{due to lack of}} sponsorship, running its final race at Talladega in May with Benny Gordon.|$|R
50|$|Electric powertrains have {{advantages}} over combustion engines in power delivery and vehicle dynamics (especially on motorbikes), but still have range disadvantages in longer races (note that combustion engine vehicle {{often have to}} refill energy supply also, e.g. Isle of Man TT bikes refill every two laps). Early electric <b>challengers</b> to combustion <b>engine</b> vehicles are therefore typically in shorter more intensive races such as hill climbs or other limited distance races, or simply in fastest lap times (e.g. around the Isle of Man Snaefell circuit). Nevertheless, for endurance racing, hybrid electric powertrains have also proven their {{advantages over}} pure combustion engine powertrains, with recent years at the 24 Hours of Le Mans all won by the hybrid electric Audi R18 e-tron quattro.|$|R
50|$|Late in {{the year}} Ford {{introduced}} their new <b>engine</b> <b>challenger,</b> the SOHC 427 Cammer, Though it is not documented it is believed a few may have found their way onto the street. (This engine was only available to racers through the dealer network or from the manufacturer, none were ever factory installed) Rated at over 600 hp (447 kW), this is possibly the most powerful engine ever fitted to a production car by an American manufacturer. NASCAR changed the rules, however, requiring (instead of hundreds) thousands of production examples in service {{to qualify for the}} next season, and Ford decided against producing the Cammer in that quantity. Fears of liability concerns and the bad publicity possibilities in giving the public a car that was so dangerously powerful are often cited as reasons, but it might simply have been that Ford doubted that an engine so unsuited to street use could sell in such numbers.|$|R
5000|$|The Fairlane's {{standard}} {{engine was}} the 170 CID (2.8 L) six, {{but as an}} option, it introduced Ford's new, lightweight Windsor V8, initially with a displacement of 221 CID (3.6 L) and 145 hp (108 kW); a 260 CID (4.2 L) [...] "Challenger" [...] version was added at mid-year, with an advertised [...] The Sports Coupe option dÃ©buted mid-year and featured bucket seats and a small floor console. The trim level supplemented the Fairlane and Fairlane 500 trim levels (the 500 model had more decorative trim, such as a wider chrome stripe down the side and three bullets on the rear quarter panels). The <b>Challenger</b> 289 CID <b>engine</b> was introduced in mid-1963, with solid lifters and other performance pieces helping the engine produce an advertised however, it was equipped with single exhaust like the less powerful engines. This engine was coded [...] "K" [...] in the vehicle identification number. Exterior identification was by fender-mounted [...] "V" [...] badges that read [...] "289 High Performance". That same year, station wagons arrived, called the Ranch Wagon and Ranch Custom Wagon. All 1962 Fairlanes had [...] "B" [...] posts despite {{the popularity of the}} pillarless hardtop and convertible styles in that era.|$|R
