40|$|BACKGROUND: In <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers,</b> {{the balance}} of {{vasoactive}} substances is in favour of vasoconstrictors with relatively insufficient nitric oxide. Endothelial dysfunction has been documented in <b>cirrhotic</b> rat <b>livers</b> leading to a lower activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase but {{this might not be}} sufficient to explain the low nitric oxide presence. We compared the amount of all nitric oxide synthase isoforms and other factors that influence nitric oxide bioavailability in livers of two portal hypertensive rat models: prehepatic portal hypertension and carbon tetrachloride induced cirrhosis, in comparison with healthy controls. RESULTS: Endothelial nitric oxide synthase was the solely detected isoform by Western blotting in all <b>livers.</b> In <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers,</b> the amount of endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein was lower than in healthy controls, although an overlap existed. Levels of caveolin- 1 messenger RNA were within the normal range but endothelin- 1 messenger RNA levels were significantly higher in <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers</b> (p < 0. 05). A markedly lower superoxide dismutase activity was observed in <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers</b> as compared to healthy controls (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to prehepatic portal hypertension, <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers</b> had decreased endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein and enhanced endothelin- 1 messenger RNA amount. We hypothesise that a vasodilator/vasoconstrictor imbalance may be further aggravated by the reduced activity of superoxide dismutase. Decreased activity allows enhanced superoxide action, which may lead to breakdown of nitric oxide in liver sinusoids. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion {{injury is}} an {{inevitable}} consequence during liver surgery. The outcome is particularly poor in <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers,</b> {{which are more}} prone to hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury. We aim to study whether FTY 720 could attenuate hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury both in normal and in <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers.</b> We applied a 70 % liver-ischemia (60 min) model in rats with normal or <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers.</b> FTY 720 was given 20 min before ischemia and 10 min before reperfusion (1 mg/kg, i. v.). Liver tissues and blood were sampled at 20 min, 60 min, 90 min, 6 h and 24 h after reperfusion for detection of MAPK-Egr- 1, Akt pathways and caspase cascade. Hepatic ultrastructure and apoptosis were also compared. FTY 720 significantly improved liver function in the rats with normal and <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers.</b> Akt pathway was activated at 6 and 24 h after reperfusion. FTY 720 significantly down-regulated Egr- 1, ET- 1, iNOS and MIP- 2 accompanied with up-regulation of A 20, IL- 10, HO- 1 and Hsp 70. MAPK (Raf-MEK-Erk) pathway was down-regulated. Hepatic ultrastructure was well maintained and fewer apoptotic liver cells were found in the FTY 720 groups. In conclusion, FTY 720 attenuates ischemia-reperfusion injury in both normal and <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers</b> by activation of cell survival Akt signaling and down-regulation of Egr- 1 via Raf-MEK-Erk pathway. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Human liver tissue was obtained from livers procured from multiorgan donors and from <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers</b> of patients. To assess tissue viability, perfusate glutamate-oxalacetate-transaminase (GOT), glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase (GPT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were determined. To assess tissue functionality, the uptake of taurocholic acid and phase I and II metabolism of lidocaine and 7 -hydroxycoumarin were determined. Uptake of a drug-targeting preparation was studied with Dexa(10) -HSA, which is designed for targeting of dexamethasone to nonparenchymal cells in the liver. During a 90 -min perfusion period, no elevation of either GOT, GPT, or LDH was found. Both healthy control <b>livers</b> and <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers</b> showed phase I and II drug metabolism and functional taurocholic acid uptake. Studies with Dexa(10) -HSA revealed that 60 min after administration, 40 % of the dose had been taken up by control livers and only 5 % by <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers.</b> In control livers, Kupffer and endothelial cells had taken up Dexa(10) -HSA, whereas in <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers</b> only Kupffer cells were responsible for the uptake.

The livers were then characterized hemodynami-cally: intrahepatic shunting (IHS) was determined by micro-spheres and sinusoidal capillarization by measuring the extra-vascular albumin space (EVA) by a multiple indicator dilution technique. The intrinsic clearance was determined by assaying {{the activity of the}} rate-limiting enzymes in vitro. Hepatocellu-lar volume (HCV) was measured by morphometry. ABT and SBA, but not GBT, differentiated <b>cirrhotic</b> from normal <b>liver.</b> IHS ranged from normal to 10 %; all <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers</b> showed evidence of sinusoidal capillarization (reduced EVA). The <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers</b> showed a bimodal distribution of HCV, HCV being decreased in 50 % of the <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers.</b> Multivariate analysis showed EVA and portal flow to be the main determinants of microsomal (ABT) and cytosolic (GBT) clearance function; SBA, by contrast, were determined solely by IHS.

A rat colon cancer cell line, RCN- 9, was used to inoculate rat livers. Treatment with conditioned media of Kupffer cells isolated from CCl 4 -induced <b>cirrhotic</b> rat <b>livers</b> (<b>cirrhotic</b> KCM) significantly reduced the incidence of hepatic colonization of RCN- 9 cells. In vitro cytotoxicity of Kupffer cells and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) on RCN- 9 cells was evaluated using [3 H]-release assay. RCN- 9 cells were resistant to cytotoxicity mediated by cirrhotic Kupffer cells, but were sensitized to TIL-mediated killing after treatment with cirrhotic KCM. The specific killing induced by TILs was FasR-mediated, as it was inhibited by ZB 4, an antagonistic anti-FasR antibody. In agreement, cirrhotic KCM increased recombinant Fas ligand-induced apoptosis of RCN- 9 cells, and up-regulated FasR expression on RCN- 9 cells as evaluated by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. These findings suggest that Kupffer cells in <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers</b> sensitize metastatic colon cancer cells to FasR-mediated apoptosis by up-regulating the receptors, which thus prepare them to be eliminated by infiltrating lymphocytes. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|R

There are no published systematic population studies on NRH and our current knowledge is limited to case reports and case series. NRH may develop via autoimmune, hematological, infectious, neoplastic, or drug-related causes. It is associated with rheumatoid arthritis, Felty syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, liver, kidney and bone marrow transplantation, cytotoxic drugs like azathioprine, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, antiretroviral drugs for HIV like didanosine and vitamin A. The disease is usually asymptomatic, slowly or non-progressive unless complications of portal hypertension develop. Accurate diagnosis is made by histopathology, which demonstrates diffuse micronodular transformation without fibrous septa. Lack of perinuclear collagen tissue distinguishes NRH from typical regenerative nodules in the <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>liver.</b> While the initial treatment is to address the underlying disease, ultimately the therapy is directed to the management of portal hypertension.

40|$|AbstractFrom a hemodynamic {{point of}} view, hepatic {{vascular}} resistance and portal inflow determine {{the level of}} portal pressure. Factors that determine hepatic vascular resistance include both structural and dynamic components. Among the structural components are histological characteristics such as steatosis, fibrosis, regeneration nodules, and neo-angiogenesis. Dynamic structures include cells with contractile properties such as hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and Kupffer cells. The contributions of the interactions between four cells in <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers</b> resulted in hepatic endothelial dysfunction, hepatic microcirculatory dysfunction, hepatic venous dysregulation, hepatic fibrogenesis, and subsequently increased intrahepatic resistance and portal hypertension in cirrhosis. The pathogenic mechanisms that trigger the associated abnormalities in hepatic microcirculations include persistent endotoxemia, increased hepatic oxidative stress, activated endocannabinoids substances, pathogenic sinusoidal remodeling, and hypoperfusion in <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers.</b> Cumulative data suggested that various therapeutic strategies targeting hepatic microcirculation provided effective improvement of the systemic abnormalities of cirrhosis.

AIM: We studied the immunohistochemical expression of hnRNPK and Claudin- 4 in HCV induced early HCC (eHCC) and adjacent liver tissue in Egyptian patients to improve eHCC detection in <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers</b> with better curative therapy options. METHOD: We studied the immunohistochemical expression of hnRNPK and Claudin- 4 in 100 Egyptian patients resection specimens of HCV induced early HCC (eHCC) and adjacent liver tissue, {{in order to}} improve eHCC detection in <b>cirrhotic</b> <b>livers,</b> thus improving their therapeutic options. RESULTS: Early HCC grade significantly directly correlated with nuclear hnRNPK/ 5 HPFs count and inversely correlated with Claudin- 4 expression %, with a converse correlation between hnRNPK and Claudin- 4. Moreover in eHCC, combined hnRNPK ³ 30 / 5 HPFs & Claudin- 4 ³ 40 % significantly distinguished low grade eHCC (G 1) from high grade eHCC (G 2 &G 3), with sensitivity 97 % & specificity 69. 7 % for hnRNPK ³ 30 / 5 HPFs, and with sensitivity 70 % & specificity 94. 3 % for Claudin- 4 ³ 40 %.
