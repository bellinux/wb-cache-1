40|$|The {{choice of}} {{substrates}} for vegetable and ornamental plant production is {{an aspect of}} basic importance. Because of its overall appropriate characteristics, peat is the main substrate used in the nurseries. However, because of peat high water retention, other substrate components are sometimes added {{in order to improve}} its hydraulic properties. Because of the increasing price of peat and environmental concerns related with its extraction, researchers have been searching for materials that can replace it, at least partially, in the substrates. In this perspective, rice hulls appear to be potentially interesting because they are a cheap organic by-product and because of their capacity to increase porosity in growing media mixes. In this research, substrates containing 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of rice hulls in substitution of peat moss were chemically characterized. Whenever possible, the analytical CEN methods for substrates were used. Then, in order to evaluate the suitability of these mixes as substrates for transplant production, experiments were carried out on one cultivar of tomato and pepper and two cultivars of chicory. Plants were grown in a greenhouse with daily fertigation. The chemical profile showed that all the substrates could be employed for cultivations in nursery as features as pH, electrical conductivity and organic carbon are compatible with literature recommendations. Some concerns can rise from the unbalanced nutrients content. Regarding the agronomic experiment, different responses were observed among species. Pepper and tomato were negatively influenced by increased % of rice hulls in the substrates and rice hulls then not suitable for peat replacement in substrate with these plants. Differently, despite varietal differences, chicory appeared to be better suited to the <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> <b>substrates</b> containing rice hull.

The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the modulation of chondrocyte phenotype by <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> polymer <b>substrates</b> containing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG).

On these surfaces, chondrocytes also expressed focal adhesion and signaling proteins indicative of cell attachment, spreading, and FA turnover, including RhoA, focal adhesion kinase, and vinculin. The switch to a dedifferentiated chondrocyte phenotype correlated with integrin expression.

In contrast to other acetic acid strains, no exocellulose formation has been measured. Considerable differences in metabolite yields have been observed {{with regard to the}} carbohydrate source. It was shown that glucose was inadequate for EPS production since most of this substrate (0. 84 C-mol/C-mol) was oxidized into gluconic acid, 2 -ketogluconic acid, and 5 -ketogluconic acid. In contrast, sucrose and fructose supported a 0. 35 C-mol/C-mol gluconacetan yield. In addition, growing G. xylinus on sucrose produced a 0. 07 C-mol/C-mol levan yield. The composition of EPS remained unchanged {{during the course of the}} fermentations. Levan sucrase activity was found to be mainly membrane associated. In addition to levan production, an analysis of levan sucrase's activity also explained the formation of glucose oxides during fermentation on sucrose through the release of glucose. The biosynthetic pathway of gluconacetan synthesis has also been explored.

After MSC <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> PET <b>substrates</b> we made a cytotoxicity evaluation, an optic and confocal microscopic evaluation (cells adhesion, cells polarization [...] .) and tests to optimize cell differentiation towards osteogenic fate. Results. PET is a highly suitable thermo-plastic material, able to sustain the necessary methods to obtain nanostructured <b>substrates.</b> MSCs cultivated <b>on</b> nanostructured PET rapidly align with the direction of the nanostructure itself without any cytotoxic effects. After the <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> the nanostructures, MSCs sustained cytoskeleton changes suggesting the activation of intracellular signaling (mechanotrasduction) promoting osteogenesis. Conclusions. The mechanisms by which nanotopographic cues influence stem cell proliferation and differentiation appear to involve changes in cytoskeletal organization and structure, potentially in response to the geometry and size of the underlying features of the ECM by a process called mechanotrasduction. Integrating nanotopographical cues is especially important in engineering complex tissues that have multiple cell types and require precisely defined cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions at the nanoscale. Thus, in the next-generation regenerative engineering approaches, nanoscale materials/scaffolds are expected to play a parimary role in controlling MSC fate and the consequent regenerative capacity...|$|R
40|$|Auricularia polytricha is an edible mushroom, {{also known}} as black jelly. In Indonesia, {{although}} A. polytricha has been extensively cultured on the wood meal substrates, information is very limited on effects of wood meal from various tree species used for <b>cultivation</b> <b>substrates</b> <b>on</b> A. polytricha <b>cultivation</b> characteristic. An investigation, therefore, is needed to find suitable tree species for the substrate of A. polytricha cultivation. In this study, wood meals of 3 tropical hardwood species (Falcataria moluccana, Shorea sp., and Tectona grandis) from Indonesia were used as basal cultivation substrates. The fastest mycelia growth {{was found in the}} substrate made of Shorea sp., and the highest glucosamine content was found in the substrates made of Shorea sp. and F. moluccana. No significant difference in the period of time to the first harvest was found between F. moluccana (23 days) and Shorea sp. (25 days), whereas a significant difference was found in the interval between the following harvesting periods (7 and 10 days for substrates made of F. moluccana and Shorea sp., respectively). Over the entire cultivation period, the substrates made of F. moluccana produced the highest fruiting body yield, greatest biological conversion, and greatest weight loss from the substrate. These results indicate that F. moluccana wood meal is the appropriate basal substrate for A. polytricha cultivation...|$|R
40|$|Shortages in {{supply of}} {{nutrients}} and freshwater {{for a growing}} human population are critical global issues. Traditional centralized sewage treatment can prevent eutrophication and provide sanitation, but is neither efficient nor sustainable in terms of water and resources. Source separation of household wastes, combined with decentralized resource recovery, presents a novel approach to solve these issues. Urine contains within 1 % of household waste water up to 80 % of the nitrogen (N) and 50 % of the phosphorus (P). Since microalgae are efficient at nutrient uptake, growing these organisms in urine might be a promising technology to concomitantly clean urine and produce valuable biomass containing the major plant nutrients. While state-of-the-art suspension systems for algal cultivation have mayor shortcomings in their application, immobilized <b>cultivation</b> <b>on</b> Porous <b>Substrate</b> Photobioreactors (PSBRs) might be a feasible alternative. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a robust process for nutrient recovery from minimally diluted human urine using microalgae on PSBRs. The green alga Desmodesmus abundans strain CCAC 3496 was chosen for its good growth, after screening 96 algal strains derived from urine-specific isolations and culture collections. Treatment of urine, 1 : 1 diluted with tap water and without addition of nutrients, was performed at a light intensity of 600 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1 with 2. 5 % CO 2 and at pH 6. 5. A growth rate of 7. 2 g dry weight m-² day- 1 and removal efficiencies for N and P of 13. 1 % and 94. 1 %, respectively, were determined. Pre-treatment of urine with activated carbon was found to eliminate possible detrimental effects of pharmaceuticals. These results provide a basis for further development of the technology at pilot-scale. If found to be safe in terms human and environmental health, the biomass produced from three persons could provide the P for annual production of 31 kg wheat grain and 16 kg soybean, covering the caloric demand in food for almost one month of the year for such a household. In combination with other technologies, PSBRs could thus be applied in a decentralized resource recovery system, contributing to locally close the link between sanitation and food production...|$|R
