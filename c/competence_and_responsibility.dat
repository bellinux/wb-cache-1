40|$|The ethical {{dimension}} of dialogue represents {{a major concern}} {{in the context of}} current research in intercultural responsibility. In this paper, I discuss the modalities in which the notion of competence is used to conceptualise responsibility and the relationship between self and other in intercultural research, in order to critique the Cartesian presuppositions of intercultural communication theory. I argue that models of <b>competence</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> that are employed to design intercultural training operate within the paradigm of the autonomous rational agent that informs Kantian ethical thinking. I contrast the model of the competent intercultural speaker that emerges in intercultural research with the distinction proposed by Levinas between the saying and the said (le dire and le dit, meaning the event of speech and the content of speech), to suggest two scenarios of intercultural interaction that show two different approaches to responsibility, one operating in the {{dimension of}} the said and the other in the dimension of the saying. Thus, in this paper, I discuss the implications of Levinas’s reflection on the nature of language for the development of an ethical framework that addresses the limitations of current conceptualisations in intercultural communication theory of <b>competence</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility...</b>|$|E

Foreseeably, the medical participants argue that physicians are prepared, or can be easily prepared, to handle all relevant aspects of medical ethics. The contrary position is sustained by the philosophically trained participants, who believe that physicians do not, in fact cannot, sufficiently manage medico-ethical problems. This paper sees a role for both parties. Medical ethicists should properly be involved in medical education and in analytical and systematic study of medical ethics. They should not generally be involved in clinical medico-moral decision-making, which is properly the realm of patient and (ethically competent) doctor...|$|E

The temperament of daughters moderated the relation between paternal autonomy support and resistance to peer pressure, as well.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to contribute to better collaboration between ABUP and school nurses. My wish is that the findings will benefit the users of the services and that they will be useful to others involved in interdisciplinary work. The issues for this study has been how school nurses experience collaborating with ABUP, what expectations and wishes they have in relation to this collaboration, what thoughts they have about their own <b>competence</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in relation to ABUP's <b>competence</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> if there is a connection between the school nurses' thoughts on collaboration and the organization of services for children and young people.

Membership in various international bodies has given a special priority to this government. In the centre {{of this paper is}} the analysis of fiscal decentralization of local government, specifically addressing the priorities, <b>competences</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> assigned to this government during this complex process. Local government is regarded as government closer to citizens, and for this the increasing of its <b>competence,</b> financial resources <b>and</b> an active community participation in decision making, will increase the responsibilities of power. This treatment is based on the legal framework of local government, taking a look at its changes over the years, analyzing and decentralization strategy.

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{describe}} <b>and</b> analyse perceived <b>competence</b> <b>and</b> perceived <b>responsibility</b> among healthcare assistants (HC assistants), {{caring for}} patients with home mechanical ventilation (HMV) and other advanced caring needs, adjusted for socio-demographic and workplace background factors. DesignA cross-sectional study was conducted including 128 HC assistants employed in Stockholm County, Sweden. MethodsThe HC assistants responded to a study-specific questionnaire on perceived <b>competence</b> <b>and</b> perceived <b>responsibility,</b> provided socio-demographic <b>and</b> workplace background data, {{as well as information}} on the patient characteristics for the understanding of their work situations. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were performed. ResultsEighty per cent of the HC assistants rated their perceived <b>competence</b> as high, <b>and</b> fifty-nine per cent rated their perceived responsibility as high. Fifty-five per cent lacked formal healthcare training, and only one in five of the HC assistants had a formal training equivalent with a licensed practical nurse (LPN) examination. Males lacked formal training {{to a greater extent than}} females <b>and</b> rated their <b>competence</b> accordingly. On-the-job training was significantly associated with high ratings on both perceived <b>competence</b> <b>and</b> perceived <b>responsibility,</b> <b>and</b> clinical supervision was associated with high rating on perceived responsibility. ConclusionsHC assistants with limited formal training self-reported their <b>competence</b> as high, <b>and</b> on-the-job training was found to be important. Also, clinical supervision was found important for their perception of high responsibility. In Sweden, HC assistants have a 24 -hour responsibility for the care and safety of their patient with HMV and other advanced caring needs. The study results point out important issues for further research regarding formal training requirements as well as the needs for standardised workplace training and supervision of HC assistants. The consequences of transfer of responsibility by delegation from healthcare professionals to paraprofessionals within advanced home care also need further study.

The increasing complexity of topics and information require interdisciplinary cooperation and careful outlining, structuring and linking of professional <b>competences</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> within the SD field. The experience gained in a couple of recent diploma works identified GIS as an appropriate instrument for linking data, visualizations, assessment of alternative scenarios to base decision-making upon.
