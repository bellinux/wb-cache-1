The following features were revealed. The shunting current increases with increasing <b>transport</b> <b>current</b> and with increasing crack size. At low voltage where shunting current is low, the <b>transport</b> <b>current</b> of cracked sample normalized {{with respect to the}} <b>transport</b> <b>current</b> in non-cracked state is described with the modified ratio of non-cracked area to overall cross-sectional area of superconducting layer. At high voltage where the shunting current is high, the normalized <b>transport</b> <b>current</b> becomes higher than the modified ratio of non-cracked area. The increase in shunting <b>current</b> with <b>transport</b> <b>current</b> (and voltage) leads to a decrease in n-value at high current (voltage). This phenomenon is enhanced by crack extension...|$|R

50|$|Sandy shores, {{also called}} beaches, are coastal shorelines where sand accumulates. Waves and {{currents}} shift the sand, continually building and eroding the shoreline. Longshore currents flow {{parallel to the}} beaches, making waves break obliquely on the sand.

40|$|Multifilamentary Bi 2223 {{tapes are}} exposed to the {{longitudinal}} magnetic field as well as the transverse one in some electrical power apparatuses such as multilayer power transmission cables. Here, we define the longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields as the field components parallel and perpendicular to the tape axis, respectively. If the filament-bundle is twisted, it can couple to the AC longitudinal magnetic field to generate the longitudinal magnetization loss. Furthermore, the AC <b>transport</b> <b>current</b> flowing spirally in the twisted filament-bundle possibly influences the longitudinal magnetization. The longitudinal magnetization loss was measured in a twisted multifilamentary Bi 2223 tape exposed to longitudinal magnetic field and carrying the <b>transport</b> <b>current.</b> The measured longitudinal magnetization loss in the twisted tape exposed to the longitudinal magnetic field is larger than that in another untwisted tape. Supplying the AC <b>transport</b> <b>current</b> changes the longitudinal magnetization loss in the twisted tape exposed to the AC longitudinal magnetic field. The influence of the <b>transport</b> <b>current</b> depends on the phase relation between the longitudinal magnetic field and the <b>transport</b> <b>current.</b> If their phase difference is 0 °, the longitudinal magnetization loss decreases remarkably with increasing amplitude of the <b>transport</b> <b>current.</b> It means that the change in the current distribution due to the <b>transport</b> <b>current</b> results in the decrease in the power flow from the magnet power supply. But, a preliminary measurement of the transport loss shows that the total loss increases with increasing <b>transport</b> <b>current.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Although {{there are}} several {{criticism}} from the local and international press regarding the lower-than-expected economic results achieved during her first term ahead {{of the government and}} the measures taken to solve it, Rouseff's approval rates reached levels higher than any other president {{since the end of the}} military regime until a wave of protests struck the country in mid 2013 reflecting insatisfaction from the people with the <b>current</b> <b>transport,</b> healthcare and education policies, among other issues that affected the popularity not only of the president, but several other governors and mayors from key areas in the country as well.|$|E
5|$|Distance {{from the}} sea is another {{important}} geographic factor. Owing {{to the shape of}} the country, the close proximity to the ocean means that most of the country, excluding the north is moderated by the surrounding oceans, leading to lower thermal amplitudes than comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The two main currents that impact the climate of Argentina are the Brazil Current from the north and the Malvinas Current from the south (a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current). The Brazil <b>Current</b> <b>transports</b> warm subtropical waters southwards while the Malvinas <b>Current</b> <b>transports</b> cold, subantarctic waters northwards. The Malvinas Current cools the coastal areas, particularly during winter when the current is more stronger. Thus, coastal areas of the Pampas have cooler summers and a longer frost period owing to the cold Malvinas Current. As well, it is the main factor in making Tierra del Fuego colder than at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since it is influenced by the cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{influence}} of current distribution on the <b>transport</b> <b>current</b> loss in vertically stacked high-Tc superconductor (HTS) tapes was evaluated. AC loss was analyzed {{as a function}} of current distribution by introducing a current distribution parameter through a numerical method (finite element analysis). AC loss under non-uniform current distribution is always higher than that for a uniformly distributed <b>transport</b> <b>current</b> in a conductor. Although the effect of non-uniformity is relatively insignificant in low <b>transport</b> <b>current,</b> AC loss increases substantially in high <b>transport</b> <b>current</b> regions as non-uniformity is enlarged.
