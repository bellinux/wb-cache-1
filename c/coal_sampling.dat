Firstly, the scheme of secondary carbonization was designed, and then, according to it, the heat transmission and the temperature field evolvement rule were analyzed in the process of carbonization. Finally, the secondary carbonization experiment of <b>coal</b> <b>sample</b> preparation was conducted, and the <b>coal</b> <b>sample</b> was obtained successfully. The results show that the temperature rise velocity in the center of <b>coal</b> <b>sample</b> is from fast to slow in the process of secondary carbonization, and the reasonable calefaction time is about 15000 seconds...|$|R

The optimum temperature to run the decarboxylation experiments was determined as 150 °C and 2 % Cr 3 + or Fe 3 + loadings for the raw <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> and 1 % Cr 3 + or Fe 3 + metal loadings for the demineralized <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> were found to be the optimum values to obtain the highest calorific value coal after decarboxylation reactions. Addition of Cr 3 + or Fe 3 + to raw and/or demineralized <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> decreased the activation energies of the decarboxylation reactions by about 40 % (raw <b>coal</b> <b>samples)</b> and 30 % (demineralized <b>coal</b> <b>samples).</b> Activation energies calculated for experiments with Cr 3 + loaded <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> were lower than those for Fe 3 + loaded <b>coal</b> <b>samples,</b> indicating higher catalytic activity of Cr 3 + as a catalyst...|$|R
30|$|The {{calorific values}} {{of all the}} <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> are high enough {{and can be used}} for power generation. The Shankodi-Jangwa <b>coal</b> <b>sample</b> with the highest heating value of 6, 502.70 [*]cal/g may be the best for heating and power generation, but it may require sulphur {{reduction}} prior to use. The lower sulphur contents of both Tai and Garin Maiganga <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> make them more suitable for smokeless fuel production, heating of residential buildings, firing kiln for cement production, raising steam for power generation and in foundry coke production without any concern of sulphur pollution. The <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> may be used for liquefaction because lignitic, sub-bituminous and high-volatile bituminous coals are potentially good for liquefaction to produce synthetic crude oil and tar[23]. For coal gasification, the Shankodi-Jangwa <b>coal</b> <b>sample,</b> being bituminous, is the only <b>coal</b> <b>sample</b> with potentials for hydro-gasification to produce methane, even though there may be a problem of caking because bituminous coals are known to cake on gasification[23].|$|R
5000|$|Sampling of coal is an {{important}} part of the process control in the CPP. A grab sample is a one-off sample of the coal at a point in the process stream, and tends not to be very representative. A routine sample is taken at a set frequency, either over a period of time or per shipment. <b>Coal</b> <b>sampling</b> consists of several types of sampling devices. A [...] "cross cut" [...] sampler mimics the [...] "stop belt" [...] sampling method specified by a standard originally published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). A cross cut sampler mounts directly on top of the conveyor belt, the falling stream sampler is placed at the head section of the belt. There are several points in the wash plant that many coal operations choose to sample. The raw coal, before it enters the plant. The refuse, to see what the plant missed. Then the clean coal, to see exactly what is being shipped. The sampler is set according to Tons per hour, Feet per minute and top size of the product on the actual belt. A sample is taken then crushed, then sub sampled and returned to the main belt. The sample is sent to an Independent lab for testing where the results will be shared with the buyer as well as the supplier. The buyer in many cases will also sample the coal again once it is received to [...] "double check" [...] the results. Continuous measurement of ash, moisture, kCal (BTU), sulfur Fe, Ca, Na, and other element constituents of the coal are reported by cross belt elemental analyzers. This information can be calibrated periodically to the lab data per ASTM methods.|$|E

40|$|Coal {{spontaneous}} combustion (CSC) generally induces fire disasters in underground mines, thus causing serious casualties, environmental pollution, and property loss around the world. By using six P-containing additives to process three typical <b>coal</b> <b>samples,</b> {{this study investigated}} the variations of the self-ignition characteristics of the <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> before and after treatment. The analysis was performed by combining thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TG/DSC) Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and low temperature oxidation. Experimental results showed that P-containing inhibitors could effectively restrain the heat emitted in the combustion of <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> and therefore the ignition temperature of the <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> was delayed at varying degrees. The combustion rate of the <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> was reduced as well. At the temperatures ranging from 50 °C to 150 °C, the activation energy of the <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> after the treatment was found to increase, which indicated that the <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> were more difficult to be oxidized. After being treated with phosphorus flame retardants (PFRs), the content of several active groups represented by the C-O structure in the three <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> was proved to be obviously changed. This suggested that PFRs could significantly inhibit the content of CO generated by the low temperature oxidation of coal, and the flame-retardant efficiency grew with the increasing temperature. At 200 °C, the maximal inhibition efficiency reached approximately 85 %...|$|R

In this paper, <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> from Wucaiwan in Xinjiang were pretreated with HNO 3 followed by mixed acids/ultrasound treatment. The depolymerized <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> obtained under different pH conditions were then separated by fractional washing. The structures and properties of the resulting <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> were studied by elemental analysis, FT-IR, XRD, TG–DTA, TEM, UV–Vis, and PL. The results showed that when pH =  0.012, the obtained <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> were fragments stripped off from the raw <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> by ultrasound in strong acid conditions, aliphatic hydrocarbons linked with oxygen-containing groups such as nitro group, a small amount of small aromatic molecules and mineral salts; when pH =  1.99 – 4.09, the obtained <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons linked with oxygen-containing groups such as nitro group,possessing the annulus wall of multilayer graphene fragment structures built up by sp 2 carbons, and they are typical fluorescent substances of carbon nanoparticle structure.

40|$|Run-of-mine (ROM) <b>coal</b> <b>sampling</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors in determining the disposition of ROM coal for an overall emission control strategy. Determination of the amount of sample, or still better, the frequency of ROM <b>coal</b> <b>sampling</b> is thus essential to the analysis of overall emission control strategies. A simulation model of a portion of the Upper Freeport coal seam in western Pennsylvania was developed employing conditional simulation. On the simulated deposit, different mining methods were simulated to generate ROM coal data. ROM coal data was statistically analyzed to determine the sampling frequency. Two schemes were suggested: (1) the use of geostatistical techniques if there is spatial correlation in ROM coal quality, and (2) the use of classical statistics if the spatial correlation in ROM coal quality is not present. Conditions under which spatial correlation in ROM coal quality can be expected are also examined. To link the ROM coal and coals from other sources to coal stockpiles and subsequently to solve coal blending problems, where varying qualities of stockpiled coals are normally used, an interactive computer program was developed. Simple file-handling, for stockpiling problems, and multi-objective goal programming technique, for blending problems, provided their solutions. The computer program was made suitable for use on both minicomputer and microcomputer. Menu-driven and interactive capabilities give this program a high level of flexibility that is needed to analyze and solve stockpiling and blending problems at the power plant...|$|E
40|$|Gy 2 ̆ 7 s {{sampling}} theory (Gy, 1982) can {{be applied}} to <b>coal</b> <b>sampling</b> problems to calculate the dependence of sampling variance on both the intrinsic coal properties (size distribution and washability) and the variations in coal stream properties with time (characterised by the corrected variogram). The theory has not been widely used by the coal industry in Australia, perhaps {{because of a lack of}} understanding of Gy 2 ̆ 7 s exposition. An explanation of the theory is given in simple terms, and equations useful to the coal sampler are presented and their use illustrated. Further, the application of the theory to the handling of data from on-line ash measurement instrumentation is discussed and illustrated. It is demonstrated that an on-line ash gauge can be used to characterise the time variations in coal properties in terms of a variogram which can, in turn, be corrected for gauge accuracy and then used in design calculations for a mechanical sampling system...|$|E

Eleven of 19 types of samples (58 %) demonstrated formaldehyde concentrations higher than the World Health Organization exposure limit (a 30 -min average of 100 μg m− 3). Different positive significant correlations between glyoxal/methylglyoxal and formaldehyde/acetaldehyde concentrations were observed, suggesting possible different characteristics in emissions between two pairs of carbonyl compounds. A sample in the highest inhalation risk shows 29. 2 times higher risk than the lowest sample, suggesting different <b>coal</b> <b>sampling</b> locations could contribute to the variation of inhalation risk. Inhabitants in Xuanwei also tend to spend more time cooking and more days per year indoors than the national average. The calculated cancer risk ranged from 2. 2 – 63 × 10 − 5, which shows 13 types of samples at high-risk level. Cumulative effect in combination with different carbonyls could have contributed to the additive actual inhalation cancer risk.

This paper reports progress towards development of a more comprehensive and robust model. The data base consists of partitioning parameters developed using density tracers and conventional <b>coal</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis techniques, together with recordings of parameters such as cyclone dimensions, feed pressure, medium size distribution and product media densities. These data were drawn from 15 Australian coal preparation plants. To eludicate the effects of important operating parameters on medium behaviour and on the partitioning of large particles a series of pilot scale tests were also conducted. The present model consists of eight sub-models which relate to particular aspects of dense medium cyclone operation such as medium flowrates and densities, or size-by-size separation densities and Eps. The model structure follows a logical progression which clearly demonstrates the importance of understanding medium behaviour before attempting to predict partitioning performance. The model also attempts to define {{the conditions under which}} yield losses due to unstable “surging” discharge may occur. An example of application of the model is presented with a comparison of observed and predicted performance parameters.

Coal {{samples were collected}} from Karharbari Top seam and Karharbari Bottom seam. Their megascopic characterization was performed by using the scheme proposed by Diessel (1965) and macroscopic seam profiles were constructed. For the microscopic study coal samples were crushed to 18 mesh size (< 1  mm size particles). The polished particulate coal mounts were prepared by using cold mounting epoxy resin without pressure. The study was carried out on an advanced petrological microscope equipped with MSP 200 photometry system and fluorescence attachment. The maceral nomenclature applied, followed the ICCP system (1971, 1998, 2001). For the microlithotype analysis, a 20 point Kötter graticule was used. The line to line and {{point to point distance}} was maintained 0.4  mm for both maceral and microlithotype analysis. The maceral and microlithotype counting was done simultaneously. The reflectance measurement was carried out as per the ISO standard (ISO 7404 - 5 1994). For the precise assessment of liptinite and dark vitrinite microscopic examination of macerals was carried out both under the white incident light as well as under blue light excitation. The International Committees for coal Petrology (1971) devised certain rules for the characterization of maceral association. According to which, the minimum dimension of a band to be called a microlithotype, should be 50  ×  50  mm, and the 5  % rule. The 5  % rule demonstrates that a microlithotype can have 5  % accessory macerals due to the very fact that neither the monomaceral nor the bimaceral microlithotypes are constituted exclusively of the macerals of one group or two groups respectively. Therefore, they can have 5  % accessory macerals which will have no role in their nomenclature or characterization. ICCP recommendation has been followed during the characterization of microlithotype. All the coal samples were subjected to proximate (BIS 2003) and petrographic analysis.|$|E

H., Faculty of Health Sciences, 2008 Introduction The Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) in South Africa {{issued a}} Directive B 7, titled “A Guideline for the Ventilating of Mechanical Miner Sections” to the coal mining industry. The {{main purpose of}} this {{directive}} was to reduce respirable dust exposures at the coal face with the long term objective of reducing the incidence of Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis (CWP). This study attempts to evaluate {{the appropriateness of the}} DME approach by comparing respirable coal dust results from personal samples from occupations at the coal face to the results obtained from engineering samples at the continuous miner. Objectives The objectives of this study are to: • Describe personal respirable coal dust concentrations of the occupations within the continuous miner Homogeneous Exposure Group (HEG) in five underground coal mines in Mpumalanga from January 2005 to December 2006. • Describe environmental engineering respirable coal dust concentrations of the continuous miner operator position in five underground coal mines in Mpumalanga from January 2005 to December 2006. • Compare personal respirable coal dust concentrations to Environmental Engineering Dust (EED) concentrations in five coal mines in Mpumalanga from January 2005 to December 2006. Methodology This study is descriptive in nature and was carried out utilizing historical respirable coal dust data from underground coal bord and pillar production sections. Data was supplied by Collieries Environmental Control Services (CECS) who provided a <b>coal</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis service to South African collieries. Data provided was from five large underground coal mines in the Mpumalanga coal fields. The study population consisted of occupations within the HEG of workers deployed at the coal face who were linked to Continuous Miner (CM) production activities and results from EED sampling. Results When comparing the personal sampling results to EED sampling results for each individual mine, it is evident that all the mines had lower personal sampling results than EED results, thus establishing a definite trend. When combining all the mines in the two data sets it is also evident that EED sampling results are significantly higher than personal sampling results confirming the trend observed on individual mines. Correlation tests carried out between the two data sets indicated that there is no correlation between the personal and EED sampling results. The poor correlation between the two data sets indicates that the EED sampling position is not ideal and does not take account of the actual contaminant levels leaving the coal-winning heading. Discussion and conclusion The DME directive by way of a simple calculation took the countries personal Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL) of 2 mg/m 3 and formulated a limit of 5 mg/m 3 for EED sampling results. Simple extrapolation of the EED results indicates that personal exposure is exceeded more than two-fold and thus the limit of 5 mg/m 3 as set by Directive B 7 cannot be compared to the personal respirable coal dust OEL of 2 mg/m 3. The basis of the initial calculation used to derive the 5 mg/m 3 limit assumed that the shift lengths were in the region of 8 hours and cutting times around 40...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Ülkemizde kömür ithalatı, 1970 ’li yıllarda özellikle sanayinin ihtiyacı nedeniyle başlamıştır. İlk defa ev yakıtı olarak kömür ithalatı ise 1980 yılı başlarında Zonguldak’tan yeterli kömürün gelememesi nedeniyle yapılmıştır. Mozambik’ten İstanbul’a getirilen kömür, şehrin bir miktar ihtiyacını karşılamıştır. Kömürlerin gittikçe artan sanayi ve ev yakıtı olarak kullanım ihtiyacı nedeniyle de 1990 yıllarında ithalatının artmaya başladığı görülmektedir. Özellikle Sovyet Bloku, diğer deyişle eski Demir Perde ülkelerinden yüksek kalorili ve düşük kükürtlü parça kömürler ithal edilerek ülkemizdeki hava kirliğinin önlenmesi amaçlanmıştır. Kömür ticaretinin hızla gelişmesine karşın, kalite belirlemesinde önemli rol oynayan “standartlara göre numune alma” konusunun taşıdığı önemin anlaşılması epeyce zaman almıştır. SGS’ deki çalışmalar ve diğer gözetme firmalarının da daha sonra katılımı ve desteği ile önce standartlar elde edilmiş ve ardından yurt dışında çalışma ve teknik eğitimlerle bu konu öğrenilmiş ve bilahare geliştirilmiştir. Yine bu çalışmada numunenin nasıl alınması gerektiği ve hazırlanması hususlarındaki standartların uygulanması ile ilgili ayrıntılı bilgiler sunulmuştur. Kömürlerin yurdumuza ithalinde karşılaşılabilecek kalite, ebat ve miktar problemlerinde nasıl hareket edilmesi gerektiği anlatılmıştır. Ayrıca ithalatta problemlerle karşılaşıldığında, gözetme firmalarının talimatlandırılarak bu tespitlerin sağlıklı ve isabetli bir şekilde yapılması hakkında bilgiler verilmiştir. Bu nedenle kömürden numune alma ve hazırlamanın yöntemleri ile ilgili bilgiler örneklerle beraber verilmiştir. Böylelikle kömür ticareti yapan/yapacak firmaların ithalat kontrollerinde bağımsız denetimcilerin çalışmalarını makul bir şekilde takip etmeleri de sağlanmak istenmiştir. Bu şekilde kömür ticaretiyle uğraşan firmaların standartlara uygun numune alım ve hazırlama ile doğru kalite teşhis ve tespitini kolaylıkla yapmaları amaçlanmıştır. Son yıllarda ithal edilen kömürlerin tek ocak ürünü olmaması ve ihracatçıların gerek sanayi gerekse ev yakıtı parça kömürlerde karışık ocak kömürlerini gemilere yüklemesi nedeniyle kömürden numune alımı ve hazırlanması konusu gayet önem kazanmıştır. Mağdur duruma düşen ithalatçıların bilimsel tespitlerle kömürdeki kalite problemlerini ortaya çıkarması için bağımsız uluslararası gözetim firmalarından ne şekilde yararlanacağı hakkında bilgiler de çalışma içerisinde yer almaktadır. Bununla beraber kömürlerin Türkiye’ye ithalinde Çevre ve Şehircilik Bakanlığı’nın en son uygulanmakta olan genelgesine göre yapılacak işlemler ve ithal edilecek kömürlerde aranacak özelliklerden bahsedilmiştir. Sonuç olarak; kömür ticaretinde, kömürün yükleme ve tahliye limanlarında ne gibi hususlara dikkat edilmesi gerektiği, oluşabilecek problemlerin ne şekilde çözümleneceği yönünde yol gösterici bir çalışma hazırlanması amaçlanmıştır. Coal import in Turkey {{began in}} the 1970 s {{especially}} due to the requirement of the industry. Coal was first imported as residential fuel in the early 1980 s due to failure of Zonguldak to provide sufficient coal. Coal imported from Mozambique to Istanbul partially met the need of the city. It is seen that the coal importation increased in the 1990 s to meet increasing demand for use of coal as industrial and residential fuel. Aimed at preventing air pollution, especially, high-calorie and low sulphurous coal was imported from the Soviet Block, {{also known as the}} Iron Curtain, countries. In spite of the rapid growth in coal trade, it took time to understand the importance of ‘sampling in accordance with the standards’, which plays a crucial role in quality control. First, the standards are obtained, and then this subject is learned by studies and trainings abroad with my personal efforts and then participation of other supervision firms. Besides the quality determination of the coal, it has been aimed to give short information about the physical and chemical parameters of the coal. Also important role of the inspection companies mentioned for coal trade. It is important to inform coal traders in order to be sure about the quality of coal. Also information has been provided for coal production and coal trade in World and Turkey. Sampling at the mine site, at stock and during discharge from the vessel or from the wagon/truck is explained in detail. Coal which imported for home heating has named regarding their size therefore such given names (i. e nut coal, orange coal etc.) and explained to coal trader that today coal purchase is effected with those names. In addition to those information some terms which are used for coal has been given. Also in this study, brief information is provided on coal formation and its types, and <b>coal</b> <b>sampling</b> locations and sampling methods are explained. This study also offers detailed information on complete definition of sample and standard practices of sampling and preparation. Coal imported for industry has even more importance and therefore sampling and sample preaparation is critical for quality determination. Industrial coal transactions have huge quantities and is loaded generally by mixing different quality of coal. Therefore sampling must occure for each sub-lot and sample preparation must be effected for each lot separately in order to define exact quality of product. Therefore lot system sampling is explained according to the international standard in this study. Coal for home heating generally imported in larger sizes has also another importance due to Turkish market consumption. Mostly home heating coal has big size unable to be be sampled with the recommended standard scoop. Due to their size, special iron frame is used for sampling of big size coal and sampling with this frame is also explained in the study. The international sampling standard was prepared for size below 75 mm. However home heating coal contains coal generally 300 mm in size which can not be sampled with standard scoop. This study also mentions that the nominated coal sampler must be experienced in order to visually determine the percentage of coal which is lower than 75 mm and bigger than 75 mm in size, during sampling operation. This will help the sampler to mix those fraction of coal sampled by frame, according to their fraction. Furthermore, information is provided on the courses of actions to be conducted for the problems related to quality, size, and amount, which may be encountered during coal importation, and on how to instruct supervision firms for sound and accurate controls when encountered with such issues. For this purpose, correct sampling methods are specified with conducted examples. Thus, it is aimed to inform the coal trading companies to follow works of independent inspectors during import controls in an informed manner. Most of all, it is aimed to have the coal trading companies to sample and prepare samples in accordance with the standards and to make accurate quality controls. Recently <b>coal</b> <b>sampling</b> and preparing samples have become more important owing to the fact that imported coal is not from a single colliery and that exporters ship mixed coals from different collieries either for industrial fuel or residential lump coal. Also in this study detailed information is provided on sample preparation including place, apparatus and some physical test regarding screening for size determination, HGI,and moisture test. This study also includes information on how coal importers suffer from such issues may benefit from independent international supervision firms in order to detect quality issues for coal with correct evaluations. Also, procedures and required specification for coal to be imported are mentioned pursuant to the recent applicable memorandum of the Ministry of Environment and Urban Planning. In this study information is provided to the coal purchasers on actions to take when low quality coal is received. The calorific value is most important factor generally considered for coal imported for industrial use. Fines and foreign matters such as shist and stones, in imported coal for home heating are not accepted. Therefore the study explains the role of inspection companies for claiming such items to supplier. In addition to the quality, safety transportation and stocking of the coal and associated burning risk are explained in details. Some information has given about the oxidation and self combustion of coal. The factors which are the reason of self combustion are mentioned in details in order to take necessary precautions. Also it has been mentioned how it can be detected in early stages. As a case study, one burning of the coal case in the vessel holds during transportation is examined. Also standards which declared in the IMO regulation for the vessel which is carried coal are mentioned in details. On the other hand it has been mentioned how coal must be stocked in order to prevent burning. It also emphaises the stock height for each size of the coal types mentioned. In the light of above explanation it is remarked again that inspection company and inspectors must have experiment for sampling and sample preparation of coal for determination of quality in coal trading. In conclusion, it is aimed to be a guiding study for issues to be taken into consideration in the port of loading and port of discharge, and for solution of problems, which may arise during coal trade.

40|$|Coal is {{the prime}} fossil fuel in India and {{continues}} to {{play a vital role}} in the energy sector. Coal accounts for 60 % of the commercial energy needs and 70 % of electrical power in India comes from coal. Indian coals being of drift origin, contains large quantities of impurities which are intimately mixed, and poses serious challenges during utilization in industries. Coal is the least clean fossil fuel with respect to both local and global environment issues. The environmental impacts include those of the mining industry and coal transportation – on the landscape, rivers, water tables and other environmental media. Beneficiation of coal helps in not only improving the performance of power plants, but also reduces the transportation cost besides reducing the adverse effect on environment. In the present work, an attempt has been made to study the washability characteristics of different Indian coals by carrying out float-and-sink analysis. A total of 10 number of <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> were collected from different coalfields using the channel sampling procedure. In addition, the proximate analysis, calorific value and hardgrove grindability index has also been determined in the laboratory by following standard procedures. It was found that Most of the <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> contain high percentage of ash except the <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> from NEC., which has the lowest ash content. The calorific value of the coal was increased after carrying out the float-and-sink method of coal washing. The MCL- 2 and MCL- 5 <b>coal</b> <b>sample</b> may be used without cleaning. At low specific gravities the yield of clean coals for most of the <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> are very low. The amount of near gravity material present for most of the coals except NEC <b>Coal</b> <b>sample</b> is also very high, which makes the washing problem difficult to extremely difficult. The NEC <b>coal</b> <b>sample</b> is simple to moderate to wash compared to other <b>coal</b> <b>samples</b> used in this study.
