2500|$|The {{farmhouse}} {{was constructed}} amid towering elm trees, from hand-hewn lumber on a fieldstone foundation {{and finished with}} masonry stucco and lath work. Its architectural features included pine and wood pegged floors, walnut window trims, a main floor ceiling over three metres (10 feet) in height, a low-pitched gabled roof, a gingerbread trim-styled front veranda {{as well as a}} bathtub and shower equipped washroom fitted to an attic or <b>ceiling</b> <b>level</b> rainfall cistern —installed by the younger Bell at a time when few homes in the region had any fixed bathtubs at all. [...] Its shower and oversized bathtub (likely chosen for the younger Alexander's large frame) drew hot and cold water from piping leading to both a <b>ceiling</b> <b>level</b> cistern and to a hot water heater in the basement. The home's layout featured a central hallway plan and its ten rooms included a large kitchen, large dining room, parlour, study plus four bedrooms on its upper floor. A greenhouse conservatory with a workroom at its rear were also added by the Bells {{to the side of the}} house, off of its parlour.

Four components of reading skill were assessed: word recognition, nonword decoding, text reading accuracy and text comprehension. Overall, levels of word and nonword reading and text reading accuracy fell within average range although reading comprehension was impaired. However, there was consid-erable variability across the sample with performance on most tests ranging from floor to <b>ceiling</b> <b>levels.</b> Some chil-dren read accurately but showed very poor comprehension, consistent with a hyperlexia reading profile; some children were poor at reading words and nonwords whereas others were unable to decode nonwords, despite a reasonable level of word reading skill.

40|$|Purpose: Clinical grammar markers {{are needed}} for {{children}} with SLI older than 8 years. This study followed children studied earlier on sentences with omitted finiteness to determine if affected children continue to perform at low levels and to examine possible predictors of low performance. This is the first longitudinal report of grammaticality judgments of questions. Method: Three groups of children participated: 20 SLI, 20 age controls and 18 languagematched controls, followed from ages 6 - 15 years. An experimental grammaticality judgment task was administered with BE copula/auxiliary and DO auxiliary in Wh- and Yes/No questions for 9 times of measurement. Predictors were indices of vocabulary, nonverbal intelligence, and maternal education. Results: Growth curve analyses show that the affected group performed below the younger controls at each time of measurement, for each variable. Growth analyses show linear and quadratic effects for both groups across variables, {{with the exception of}} BE acquisition which was flat for both groups.

40|$|Discrimination of a word-final stop {{consonant}} voicing contrast, /bid/-/bit/, by 12 infants (6 - 8 and 10 - 12 months) and 6 adults {{was investigated}} in a category-change conditioned headturn procedure across three stimulus conditions: full cue (FC), burst and closure cues neutralized (BCCN), and vowel duration neutralized (VDN). Adults performed at <b>ceiling</b> <b>levels</b> for all three conditions. No infant age differences were observed. However, there was some evidence that infants benefitted from the presence of redundant acoustic cues (FC $>$ BCCN, but FC $ le$ VDN). Infants performed significantly better with the VDN stimuli indicating that final release burst information is more salient to infants than vowel duration differences for this /bid/-/bit/ contrast. This result differs from findings of prior research on adult and infant perception of such contrasts which showed a prominent use of the preceding vowel duration cue. This finding suggests that vowel duration becomes useful as a cue to final stop voicing with linguistic sophistication...|$|R
40|$|The Technique of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can {{be applied}} {{in the study of}} various {{problems}} relating to the smoke filling process and smoke movement in buildings. However, developing CFD software requires prohibitive resources and commercial packages are very expensive. However, with recent reductions in costs of CFD packages, it is now possible to apply them more frequently in more significant projects. In this project, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package PHOENICS is applied to study a forced ventilation fire. In these applications, the thermal stratified layer induced by fires in a forced-ventilation compartment might not be stable. The positions of the fresh air intake and exhaust and the ventilation rates are the important factors affecting the stability of the smoke layer and the burning process of materials involved. If hot gases cannot rise due to the strong air flow induced by the ventilation fans, those sprinkler heads and fire detectors installed at the <b>ceiling</b> <b>levels</b> might not be activated.

40|$|The {{propensity}} of humans {{to engage in}} prosocial behavior is unlike {{that of any other}} species. Individuals will help others even when it comes at a cost to themselves, and even when the others are complete strangers. However, to date, scant empirical evidence has been forthcoming on young children’s altruistic tendencies. To investigate this 45 4 -year-olds were presented with a task in which they had opportunity to help an adult confederate retrieve a reward from a novel box. In a control condition children were given no information about the effect of potential helping behavior. Alternatively they were informed that helping would either cost them (i. e., they would miss out on getting the reward) or benefit them (i. e., they would get the reward). It was hypothesized that children would be less likely, and slower, to help in the cost condition, compared to the other two conditions. This hypothesis was not supported: children across all conditions provided help at near <b>ceiling</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

A section across a re-entrant and underlying solution canyon shows a rough hour-glass shape. Solution canyons are related genetically to solutional vertical shafts, forming where {{removal of the}} impermeable sandstone caprock permits the vertical descent of water through jointed limestone. Surface runoff concentrates along re-entrant thalwegs where a large quantity of water goes underground.

Solution by water seeping down these joint planes forms solution canyons...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the {{multilateral}} trading system is to enhance the stability and predictability of the environment in which traders operate. Binding tariffs at the WTO reduces the scope for their discretionary use. But, countries have bound tariffs at <b>ceiling</b> <b>levels</b> often substantially above the level of applied tariffs. Therefore, whether the ceiling rate at which countries have committed at the WTO is sufficient to diminish trade policy volatility is an empirical question. Using a recently built database on applied tariffs covering over 100 countries for the period 1996 to 2009, we find evidence that countries do vary tariffs. Most importantly, we find evidence that applied tariffs of tariff lines that are bound {{are more likely to be}} decreased and less likely to be increased, and that this taming effect of the binding decreases with the level of the water (i. e. the gap between bound and applied tariff). This finding is robust to controlling for political economy determinants of tariffs and to factors related to the economic cycle...|$|R

In addition, the research highlights some possible imperfections in the water policies that can result in an inherent inefficiency of a water utility. The developed model can assist in setting <b>ceiling</b> <b>levels</b> for utility's water assets and labour, to ensure efficiency. The model is generic and can be applied to any country or community, and can be used to configure water utilities for the poor. The Model utilised "Matlab Fuzzy Tool Box student version 2009 a" software as a tool to develop the Fuzzy Inference Engine for Utility Efficiency.

40|$|We apply {{coupling}} and cohesion metrics {{to various}} decompositions {{of a large}} telecommunications system. Several findings emerge: 1) There is a baseline level of coupling and cohesion that represents the average connectedness of any pair of files in the system. 2) As would be expected, measures of cohesion are greater than this baseline in well-defined subsystems. 3) Interestingly, and contrary to intuition, measures of coupling for such subsystems tend also to be greater than the baseline and to increase as cohesion increases. 4) It is possible to easily calculate upper bounds for coupling and cohesion that no subsystem in a given system can exceed. 5) Measuring quality by subtracting coupling from cohesion, as has been proposed in the literature, gives anomalous results since coupling and cohesion are frequently not on the same scale. We propose improved coupling, cohesion and quality metrics that normalize for the baseline and <b>ceiling</b> <b>levels</b> in a given system.

Brief microstimulation of IL paired with conditioned tones, designed to mimic neuronal tone responses, reduces the expression of conditioned fear to the tone. In the present study we used microstimulation to investigate the role of additional mPFC subregions: the prelimbic (PL), dorsal anterior cingulate (ACd), and medial precentral (PrCm) cortices in the expression and extinction of conditioned fear. These are tone-responsive areas that have been implicated in both acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear. In contrast to IL, microstimulation of PL increased the expression of conditioned fear and prevented extinction. Microstimulation of ACd and PrCm had no effect. Under low-footshock conditions (to avoid <b>ceiling</b> <b>levels</b> of freezing), microstimulation of PL and IL had opposite effects, respectively increasing and decreasing freezing to the conditioned tone. We suggest that PL excites amygdala output and IL inhibits amygdala output, providing a mechanism for bidirectional modulation of fear expression...|$|R
