40|$|Visual {{estimation}} of object stability is an ecologically important judgment that allows observers {{to predict the}} physical behavior of objects. A natural method {{that has been used}} in previous work to measure perceived object stability is the {{estimation of}} perceived “critical angle ” – the angle at which an object appears equally likely to fall over versus return to its upright stable position. For an asymmetric object, however, the critical angle is not a single value, but varies with the direction in which the object is tilted. The current study addressed two questions: (1) Can observers reliably track the change in critical angle as a function of tilt direction? (2) How do they visually estimate the overall stability of an object, given the different critical angles in various directions? To address these questions, we employed two experimental tasks using simple asymmetric 3 D objects (skewed <b>conical</b> <b>frustums)</b> : settings of critical angle in different directions relative to the intrinsic skew of the 3 D object (Experiment 1), and stability matching across 3 D objects with different shapes (Experiments 2 & 3). Our results showed that (1) Observers can perceptually track the varying critical angle in different directions quite well; and (2) Their estimates of overall object stability are strongly biased toward the minimum critical angle (i. e., the critical angle in the least stable direction). Moreover, the fact that observers can reliably match perceived object stability across different 3 D shapes suggests that perceived stability is likely to be represented along a single dimension...|$|R

40|$|Results are {{presented}} demonstrating the e ect of inductive coil geometry and current sheet trajectory on the exhaust velocity of propellant in conical theta pinch pulsed induc- tive plasma accelerators. The electromagnetic coupling between the inductive coil of the accelerator and a plasma current sheet is simulated, substituting a <b>conical</b> copper <b>frustum</b> for the plasma. The variation of system inductance {{as a function}} of plasma position is obtained by displacing the simulated current sheet from the coil while measuring the total inductance of the coil. Four coils of differing geometries were employed, and the total inductance of each coil was measured {{as a function of}} the axial displacement of two sep- arate copper frusta both having the same cone angle and length as the coil but with one compressed to a smaller size relative to the coil. The measured relationship between total coil inductance and current sheet position closes a dynamical circuit model that is used to calculate the resulting current sheet velocity for various coil and current sheet con gura- tions. The results of this model, which neglects the pinching contribution to thrust, radial propellant con nement, and plume divergence, indicate that in a conical theta pinch ge- ometry current sheet pinching is detrimental to thruster performance, reducing the kinetic energy of the exhausting propellant by up to 50 % (at the upper bound for the parameter range of the study). The decrease in exhaust velocity was larger for coils and simulated current sheets of smaller half cone angles. An upper bound for the pinching contribution to thrust is estimated for typical operating parameters. Measurements of coil inductance for three di erent current sheet pinching conditions are used to estimate the magnetic pressure as a function of current sheet radial compression. The gas-dynamic contribution to axial acceleration is also estimated and shown to not compensate for the decrease in axial electromagnetic acceleration that accompanies the radial compression of the plasma in conical theta pinches...|$|R
