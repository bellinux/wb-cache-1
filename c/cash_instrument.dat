40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of two different interest rate futures instruments in hedging interest rate changes in short-term loans. In this case, the hedge ratio was obtained by using the empirical method of regressing changes in the price of the spot instrument against changes in the price of the futures. The interest rates on each of the short term loans to be hedged were based on the prevailing 90 -day T-Bill or CD rates. The terms of the loans were one month or three months. The hedging instruments used were T-Bill futures and Eurodollar futures contracts. This resulted in eight different types of hedges. Three methods were used to compare and assess the perfonnance of the various hedging instruments: the Standard Distance from Optimal Method, the Percentage Hedged Classification Method, and the Variation/Percentage Hedged Matrix. The Standard Distance from Optimal Method measures the average number of basis points that the hedging instrument leaves exposed in the 35 -month period. The Percentage Hedged Classification Method assigns points to a hedge by classifying its perfonnance as Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. The Variation/Percentage Hedged Matrix takes the results from the Percentage Hedged Classification method and relates them to the variability of the <b>cash</b> <b>instrument.</b> Given these means of evaluation, its was deternlined that the optimal hedging strategy with the studied hedging and cash instrumenls is as follows.

The results of this study indicate that further research is warranted to investigate the relatively higher performance of longer-term hedging instruments with short-term loans. T-Bill...|$|E

50|$|Liquidity {{risk and}} {{maturity}} mismatchLiquidity risk generally {{refers to the}} risk that a company may not have sufficient funding to satisfy its short-term needs, either through its cash flows, maturing assets, or assets salable at prices equivalent to book value, or through its ability to access funding markets. For example, if a company holds assets that are illiquid or that are subject to significant decreases in market value during times of market stress, the company {{may be unable to}} liquidate its assets effectively in response to a loss of funding. In order to assess liquidity, the Council may examine a nonbank financial company's assets to determine if it possesses <b>cash</b> <b>instruments</b> or readily marketable securities, such as Treasury securities, which could reasonably be expected to have a liquid market in times of distress. The Council may also review a nonbank financial company's debt profile to determine if it has adequate long-term funding, or can otherwise mitigate liquidity risk. Liquidity problems also can arise from a company's inability to roll maturing debt or to satisfy margin calls, and from demands for additional collateral, depositor withdrawals, draws on committed lines, and other potential draws on liquidity.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. M. (Finance & Investment)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, Graduate School of Business Administration, 2012. Research {{indicates}} that investment in un-securitised private {{real estate in}} both developed and emerging economies exhibits inflation hedging potential and provides diversification benefits for mixed-asset portfolios, {{reducing the risk of}} portfolios that contain mostly common stocks and bonds. This paper examines the risk diversification potential of securitised property funds for investment portfolios comprising traditional asset classes such as common stocks, bonds and <b>cash</b> <b>instruments</b> in the South African context – to establish if they exhibit the same characteristics as un-securitised private real estate. The results indicate that including securitised property funds in a portfolio comprised of traditional assets reduces unsystematic risk in a portfolio by a significant amount. We also assess the affecters of variability in returns of PUT and PLS funds. The results suggest that the variability in PUT and PLS returns can be explained by both the variability in the equity and debt markets (measured by the ALSI and ALBI), and the variability in direct property returns. Importantly, we find that PUT and PLS market pricing is representative of the underlying asset class pricing (direct real estate prices) ...|$|R

The estimation results highlight the importance of distinguishing between the determinants of the value and volume of noncash transactions. It is found in fact that the volume of these transactions is generally affected by changes in the determinants more strongly than their value, and that variables such as the interest rate have a different impact on the volume and the value of the transactions. The findings also suggest that past habits play a dominant role in the intensity of use of noncash payment instruments. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} reviews the risk {{financing}} techniques {{employed in the}} insurance markets {{and looks at the}} changing field of the risk management arena. The overarching view is that apart from the traditional channels of financing risk, alternative routes should be explored. The latter is strengthened with the surfacing of off-balance sheet instruments in modern financial markets. The paper extends the discussion to the layered risk financing approach and reinforces its importance. That is, <b>cash</b> flow engineering <b>instruments</b> are employed to match different segments of the loss distributions. The role of insurance risk capital to assume extreme losses is further discussed, while reinsurance still remains a form of capital restructuring. Taken all together, the intention is that risk financing should be able to release assets committed to liabilities, and should reduce the cost of risk capital in sponsoring all-purpose equity. Finally, risk management platforms are redefined, while the securitisation of insurance risk is explored along with its effectiveness and possible caveats.

We introduce necessary theory from quantitative finance related to asset price dynamics and security pricing. Further, interest rate related instruments are handled by the LIBOR Market Model (LMM), while equity prices are modeled as geometric Brownian motions. We use implied volatilities for instruments where they are available, and historical for the rest. We implement a risk model and make daily and quarterly market risk estimates between 2000 - 2008 for the portfolios. We choose some central events from the last quarter of 2008, a critical phase of the ongoing financial crisis, and analyze how the portfolios and the corresponding risk estimates are affected.
