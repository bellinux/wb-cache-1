40|$|A <b>trading</b> <b>ratio</b> is {{required}} for water quality trading that involves nonpoint sources {{to compensate for the}} difficulty of determining nonpoint loadings, the stochastic characteristics of nonpoint loadings, and the uncertainty inherent in nonpoint source pollution control strategies. Compensating for risk and uncertainty is one of the primary justifications that a <b>trading</b> <b>ratio</b> greater than one is commonly considered. However, the appropriate specific value of a <b>trading</b> <b>ratio</b> remains unclear because of qualitative differences between point and nonpoint sources. This study addresses a growing concern with the analytical underpinnings of point/nonpoint <b>trading</b> <b>ratios</b> in water quality trading programs. This paper considers a basic spatial-temporal optimal control model assuming that the goal of the decision maker is to maximize ecological services from the watershed over a 10 -year planning horizon given a predetermined budget each year to treat acid mine drainage problems. The level of pollution is assumed to be known but declining slightly over time as the acid mine drainage sources evolve. Resources are assumed to be spent on remediation projects that produce long term but declining treatment results. The primary goal of the model is to distribute the available resources over the basin by investing in restoration projects for targeted streams each year that will maximize the ecological return on this investment. The model reflects both the spatial reality of variations in flow, in pollution, in treatment, and in the ecological benefits produced and the intertemporal constraints of limited resources and the inability to move remediation programs once the initial investment is made. The resulting optimal temporal and spatial investment strategies are derived from solutions to a mixed integer programming problem obtained using the GAMS/CPLEX mixed integer programming package. The optimal results are then manipulated to evaluate <b>trading</b> <b>ratios.</b> A hypothetical acidity trading scenario is proposed in which a point source (a new coal mine operation subject to TMDL rules) uses credits generated through remediation projects at other sites from treatment of nonpoint sources within the same basin over the 10 -year planning horizon. The <b>trading</b> <b>ratio</b> is the ratio of the expected amount of pollutant removed by treating the nonpoint source divided by the amount of additional pollution allowed from the new point source. Our results indcate that point/nonpoint <b>trading</b> <b>ratios</b> in proposed <b>trading</b> scenarios greater than one can be justified. For example, for a point/nonpoint trade between sources in adjacent stream segments, the appropriate <b>trading</b> <b>ratio</b> is 3. 66 (or 3. 66 to one). We note that current regulations give a lower bound for point/nonpoint <b>trading</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1 : 1. The upper bound for point/nonpoint <b>trading</b> <b>ratio</b> depends on technical aspects of the relative costs of treating the point source or treating nonpoint sources and reflects the limit of how much one is willing to pay for credits. A variety of factors determine <b>trading</b> <b>ratios.</b> First, to encourage trades with less uncertainty, trades in which the credit seller and buyer are in close proximity, and in which the credit seller is upstream, lower <b>trading</b> <b>ratios</b> are recommended. Second, <b>trading</b> <b>ratios</b> should be adjusted to favor trades that contribute to strategic restoration goals such as the improvement or maintenance of water quality in a particular basin. Reduced ratios provide incentives to promote the generation of credits in priority locations. Finally, <b>trading</b> <b>ratios</b> for same-pollutant <b>trades</b> should be lower than those for cross-pollutant trades. Three separate trading currencies would be used to account for same-pollutant acid mine drainage trades: pounds of iron, aluminum, and manganese. There would be little uncertainty in the outcome of a trade if the credit generator and buyer were affecting the same pollutant. In contrast, cross-pollutant trades that use a common currency such as ecological indices would be measured based on their ecological effect, which is one step removed from the actual changes in pollutant loads. The higher <b>trading</b> <b>ratio</b> required for cross-pollutant trades reflects this greater uncertainty. All potential trades considered in this study are interspatial trades; trades occur in the same basin; trades could be cross-pollutant trades within acid mine draiange and same-pollutant trades as well; and the credit buyer is the new coal mining operation; credit generators could be government agencies or nonprofit organization; and abandned mine lands and bond forfeiture sites can be sites where credits are generated. point-nonpoint water quality <b>trading,</b> <b>trading</b> <b>ratio,</b> acid mine drainage, spatial-temporal optimization, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen from non-point sources {{reacts with}} the {{environment}} during flow to the waterway. These reactions cause decay of the pollutant. There is a question regarding whether pollution trades between point sources and non-point sources that involve nitrogen should consider this decay. The failure to consider this decay may cause trades to fail to achieve their environmental goal or to inefficiently achieve their environmental goal. Additionally, planners may consider the decay to target reductions and improve efficiency of trading programs. ^ The dissertation uses a geographic information system (GIS) and the finite segment method to evaluate {{the need for the}} use of a <b>trading</b> <b>ratio</b> to consider decay. It uses GIS, principles of process engineering, and principles of hydrology to model the distribution of the nitrogen in the watershed with and without decay. Additionally, it compares the predictions of the concentrations with and without decay.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine how a {{depreciation}} in the exchange rate affects the trade balance in an economy over time. The outcomes of a depreciation are possible to analyze through the J-curve phenomenon that shows {{the relation between the}} exchange rate and the trade balance both in the short-run and the long-run. The data used in this thesis cover 39 countries and their quarterly changes in exchange rate between 1982 and 2005. The largest depreciation for each country during these years was detected and is the base for this research. In this thesis, focus is on the <b>trade</b> <b>ratio</b> rather than the trade balance for empirical purposes. The relation between the largest depreciations and its effect on the <b>trade</b> <b>ratio</b> are examined in two sets of regressions. The results show no evidence of a J-curve in neither one of the sets of regressions, even though the <b>trade</b> <b>ratio</b> is positively affected by the depreciation. When testing only for significantly large depreciations in the exchange rate the affect on the <b>trade</b> <b>ratio</b> is stronger, all else equal. According to the findings in this thesis, a depreciation in the real effective exchange rate causes the <b>trade</b> <b>ratio</b> to increase immediately and then decrease over time.

By utilizing this property, we design a trading-ratio system (TRS) of tradable discharge permits for water pollution control.

40|$|The optimal {{pollution}} permit trading system is examined when the regulator, faced with incomplete information on firms' abatement costs and delivery coefficients, seeks to minimize expected total abatement costs {{to meet an}} ex ante pollution target. Intuitively, {{we find that the}} optimal <b>trading</b> <b>ratio</b> and permit cap are set such that there will be more pollution when abatement costs are high and less pollution when abatement costs are low. Surprisingly however, even when the delivery coefficients are known with certainty, the optimal <b>trading</b> <b>ratio</b> will not necessarily equal the delivery coefficient, nor will it be optimal for the total permit quantity to equal the given pollution target. Instead, the <b>trading</b> <b>ratio</b> will tend to be larger when there is negative correlation between firms' abatement costs and/or there is positive correlation between abatement costs and the delivery coefficient. The result that the optimal permit trading system under these circumstances depends on the regulator's information on firm's abatement costs contrasts sharply with a previously well-established attribute of permit trading systems: no information on firms' abatement costs is needed in order to design an optimal policy and achieve the least cost of reaching a pollution target (ex post). Our results demonstrate that whether an ex ante or ex post pollution target is used has fundamental implications for the design of the permit trading system.
