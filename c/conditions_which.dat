5|$|Adolf Hitler summoned Lieutenant-General Kurt Student of the 7. Flieger-Division (7th Air Division) {{to discuss}} the assault. It was first {{suggested}} that a conventional parachute drop be made by airborne forces to seize and destroy the forts' guns before the land units approached. Such a suggestion was rejected as the Junkers Ju 52 transports were too slow and {{were likely to be}} vulnerable to Dutch and Belgian anti-aircraft guns. Other factors for its refusal were the weather <b>conditions,</b> <b>which</b> might blow the paratroopers away from the fort and disperse them too widely. A seven-second drop from a Ju 52 at minimum operational height led to a dispersion over 300metres alone.|$|E

5|$|Eye <b>conditions</b> <b>which</b> {{affect the}} Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a {{heritable}} condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E
5|$|If two {{cells of}} the same type meet in this phase, they cross-fertilise to a diploid zygote through the fusion of protoplasms and nuclei. The <b>conditions</b> <b>which</b> trigger this are not known. The diploid zygote becomes a multinucleated {{plasmodium}} through multiple nuclear divisions without further cell division. If the resulting cells were peritrichous, they change their shape before the fusion from the peritrichous form to the myxamoeba. For {{the production of a}} zygote, cells of different mating types (heterothallic) are required.|$|E

Despite the Sultan's disapproval, Amir became more heavily involved in the nationalist movement, bringing him under increasing Dutch scrutiny. He continued to publish in Poedjangga Baroe, including a series of five articles on Eastern literatures from June to December 1934 and a translation of the Bhagavad Gita from 1933 to 1935. His legal studies, however, were delayed, and by 1937 he had still not graduated.|$|E
