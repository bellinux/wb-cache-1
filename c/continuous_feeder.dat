50|$|A TXDOT {{study is}} {{currently}} underway for Segment D of the Grand Parkway. The study includes looking {{at ways to}} reduce traffic in the original segment of the non-tolled portion of the freeway; this includes the possibility of adding <b>continuous</b> <b>feeder</b> roads. This segment has been open since 1994 and population, and thus traffic, in the surrounding area has increased exponentially. There is no timetable on when or if any new projects {{will come out of}} this study.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of funding}} constraints, two {{sections}} of the freeway inside Beltway 8 were not built to full freeway standards: a half-mile section over Greens Bayou and an approximately mile-long section east of Normandy Street. As of December 2012, only the feeder roads have been constructed, with space reserved in the median for future freeway mainlanes. Unlike most new freeway extensions in the Houston area built in recent decades, the Crosby Freeway is not tolled. Also unlike most of Houston's existing freeways and tollways, the Crosby Freeway does not have <b>continuous</b> <b>feeder</b> roads.|$|E
5000|$|The {{entire length}} of Allen Parkway is {{considered}} a limited-access parkway and closely follows the south bank of Buffalo Bayou. Memorial Drive, another limited-access parkway, closely follows the north bank of the bayou. Allen Parkway passes under Studemont Street/Montrose Boulevard, Waugh Drive, and Shepherd Drive. At the Waugh Drive and Studemont/Montrose interchanges, which have exit and entrance ramps and feeder roads on each side, Allen Parkway is below grade. The south side (eastbound) has <b>continuous</b> <b>feeder</b> roads, the north side (westbound) has discontinuous feeder roads. Access is not controlled at Dunlavy Street, where traffic to or from Allen Parkway can cross the median. A continuous green T-intersection at Taft Street, allowing controlled access for westbound traffic, with a stoplight for eastbound traffic existed prior to 2015 where {{the conversion of the}} westbound lanes to parking spaces (east of Montrose Boulevard) eliminated the intersection where the Taft and Gillette Street intersections have traffic signals.|$|E

40|$|The optimum {{efficiency}} of a leaky cable as a support for radio communications in tunnels involves {{a compromise between}} high leakage fields and a low increase of the coaxial mode attenuation. The latter is an important disadvantage of <b>continuous</b> leaky <b>feeders.</b> To obviate this, short leaky sections can be inserted in an otherwise well-shielded coaxial cable. These sections act as mode converters or radiators. A theoretical analysis based on coupled line theory enables us to determine the optimum characteristics of the leaky sections.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the acceptance of concentrates containing increasing levels of citrus pulp (7, 14, 21 and 28 %) and the most preferred level of inclusion, observing the first action and the palatability using the preference test. Ten healthy mares, averaging 500 kg live weigh (LW), were housed in individual pens, where the four experimental concentrates were offered simultaneously, in a linear and <b>continuous</b> <b>feeder</b> for horses, for a period of 15 min. During this period, the first action (smelling or eating), the first choice (first concentrate effectively ingested) and the intake ratio (intake of each concentrate in relation to the total concentrate intake) were observed. Effect of inclusion on first action was observed (P 0. 05), however the concentrate with 7 % was the most preferred (36. 67 %). Citrus pulp can be used as concentrate feed for horses. Therefore, low levels of inclusion in the concentrate, close to 7 %, are recommended when the concentrate is based on corn, wheat bran, soybean meal, with no flavour agents like molasses...|$|E
40|$|At the University of Pretoria's Fluoropolymer Laboratory, an {{important}} long-term {{project is the}} development of a waste polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) depolymerisation process where TFE can be produced, purified and polymerised to reproduce pure PTFE. At the start of this project, the process consisted of a batch depolymerisation system, a sub-zero distillation column, and a polymerisation reactor system. The batch depolymerisation system could not produce enough gas per session to operate the downstream processes efficiently. The main aim of this investigation was to adapt the batch depolymerisation system to enable continuous depolymerisation by designing, implementing and testing a continuous PTFE screw feeder. With the screw feeder in place, the operating limits, with regard to temperature, pressure, and Teflon® PTFE 807 N feed rate, were determined. The effects of temperature and pressure on the tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), hexafluoropropylene (HFP) and octafluorocyclobutane (OFCB) fractional composition were examined and the optimum operating conditions to maximise these products were determined statistically. An investigative approach was used in designing the hopper system. The optimum hopper wall angle and Teflon® PTFE 807 N feed mixture was determined experimentally by testing four hopper angles, pure Teflon® PTFE 807 N, and two Teflon® PTFE 807 N mixtures (Teflon® PTFE 807 N mixed with larger, compressed Teflon® PTFE 807 N, particles in a 70 : 30 wt % and 50 : 50 wt % ratio) and two motor speeds. At all of the hopper angles and Teflon mixture configurations, rat-hole formation prevented the feeder from producing a constant flow rate. A hopper wall angle of 20 ° (to the vertical) together with plain Teflon® PTFE 807 N were selected, as these two variables together helped to delay the formation of rat-holes the most. A stirrer was inserted in the hopper to negate the rat-holing problem. The <b>continuous</b> <b>feeder</b> was successfully designed, manufactured, calibrated, and installed. The feeder consists of a wedge-shaped hopper with a constant pitch, a tapered shaft screw and is capable of providing a maximum Teflon® PTFE 807 N flow rate of approximately 20 g·min- 1 for up to 40 min. Experimental test runs of the continuous depolymerisation system indicated that the minimum operating reactor temperature was 650 °C due to heat transfer and or rate of reaction limitations. The maximum flow rate of Teflon® PTFE 807 N was determined to be 11 g·min- 1 for the current reactor system. The maximum operating temperature and pressure were limited to 750 °C and 40 kPa, respectively, to avoid operating conditions that could lead to the increased production of PFIB. A three-level full factorial experimental design was used to determine the temperature and pressure effects on the fractional distribution of TFE, HFP, and OFCB under steady operating conditions. For pressure control purposed no carrier gas was used. The PTFE flow rate and experimental run time were kept constant at 11 g·min- 1 and 15 min, respectively. The pressure in the system was regulated manually by constricting the flow of product gas out of the system. A maximum TFE mole percentage of 97 % was achieved at operating conditions of 650 °C and 2 kPa. The maximum HFP mole percentage (31 %) was observed at operating conditions of 750 °C and 20 kPa. A maximum of 55 % was observed at 750 °C and 40 kPa for OFCB. Statistical analysis of the continuous depolymerisation results indicate that TFE formation is highly sensitive to changes in pressure, with higher TFE yield fractions achieved at low pressures. The production of OFCB is highly sensitive to pressure, whereas the formation of HFP is equally affected by pressure and temperature changes. However, changes in pressure have a larger effect on the HFP production than temperature when operating at pressures lower than approximately 20 kPa. At higher pressures the sensitivity has the inverse affect, with temperature having a larger effect. As opposed to TFE, an increase in temperature and pressure leads to an increase in the HFP and OFCB concentration. To achieve a TFE mole percentages of 95 % and higher, the operating temperature of the system has to be kept in the range of 650 °C 720 °C, together with a system pressure of 2 kPa or less. Within the operating range of 730 °C 750 °C and 35 kPa 40 kPa a mole percentage of 50 % and higher can be expected for OFCB. A mole percentage of 19 % and higher can be expected for HFP in the operating range of 744 °C 750 °C and 32 kPa 40 kPa. It was determined through a kinetic analysis of the system, that the residence time of the product gas in the reactor has a large effect on the production of HFP, with an increase in residence time leading to a sharp increase in the HFP concentration and a decrease in the OFCB and TFE concentrations. Analysis of the determined product specific kinetics indicate that the predominant HFP production pathway at low residence times (&# 060 3 s) is via the reaction of TFE with difluorocarbenes. At higher residence times the dominant reaction pathway is the dissociation OFCB. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017. Chemical EngineeringMEngUnrestricte...|$|E
40|$|In a 10 day {{cross over}} design experiment, six Friesian cows, in late lactation, were fed either white clover or white clover plus maize silage on a 50 : 50 DM basis in {{metabolism}} cages from <b>continuous</b> <b>feeders.</b> Data for intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance, milk production and rumen pH, {{volatile fatty acids}} (VFA), ammonia, fluid flow rate, pool sizes and protozoa population were collected. Replacing 50 % of white clover with maize silage reduced nitrogen intake significantly (P< 0. 001) and increased neutral detergent fibre (NDF) intake (P< 0. 01) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) intake (P< 0. 05). Digestibility was reduced significantly as follows: dry matter digestibility (P< 0. 05), organic matter, NDF, and ADF digestibilities (P< 0. 01) and crude protein digestibility (P< 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference}} between diets for dry matter intake (DMI), organic matter intake (OMI) or digestible organic matter intake (DOMI). Milk yield and composition were similar for both diets. Rumen fluid ammonia concentration and urea nitrogen in urine were reduced significantly (both at P< 0. 001) by adding maize silage to white clover. There was no significant difference in nitrogen in milk or nitrogen balance. Rumen protozoa population increased significantly in the cows fed white clover plus maize silage diet due to an increase in Entodinium, No/ml (P< 0. 05) and total protozoa No/ml (P< 0. 01). There was no significant difference in rumen fluid VFA, pH, or fluid flow rate. It was concluded that feeding white clover with maize silage improves the efficiency of utilization of nitrogen in white clover which potentially can increase milk production per cow and/or per hectare without changing the milk composition or altering the rumen environment.

40|$|Teleost fishes occupy {{virtually}} every aquatic habitat {{on earth and}} as a group face {{a wide range of}} environmental challenges in their natural habitats, as well as during their life histories. In order to survive and thrive {{in the face of these}} challenges, it is essential for them to maintain homeostasis, as well as to acquire and assimilate energy. For this to occur the gastrointestinal tract must function effectively and efficiently, which is achieved through a wide range of processes including tightly regulated gastrointestinal motility and blood flow responses. The overall aim of this thesis was to provide further insight into the importance of gastrointestinal motility and blood flow in teleosts by focusing on their role during digestion and osmoregulation. Using a combination of methods, a range of propagating and non-propagating in vivo intestinal motility patterns were documented in shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Pre-prandially, both species of teleosts displayed a rhythmic, anally propagating motility pattern resembling and most likely sharing a similar 'housekeeper' function as mammalian migrating motor complexes. Following the ingestion of food, this motility pattern was reduced and replaced by irregular contractile activity in the shorthorn sculpin, whereas it persisted in the rainbow trout, which most likely reflects the differences in feeding strategy between the two species (i. e. intermittent vs. <b>continuous</b> <b>feeders,</b> respectively). Gastrointestinal motility also plays an important role in osmoregulation. Euryhaline rainbow trout rapidly initiated a drinking response in order to maintain water balance when transitioning from freshwater to seawater. To promote water absorption in the intestine, imbibed seawater was substantially desalinated in the oesophagus. This was followed by a gradual increase in the contractile activity of the intestine, which plateaued after ~ 2 days to remain at a significantly elevated level in fully seawater-acclimated individuals. It seems that the teleost analogue of the mammalian migrating motor complexes may also play an osmoregulatory role, as their frequency was significantly higher in seawater. This motility pattern may be necessary for transporting and mixing imbibed seawater in an optimal manner for ion and water absorption, as well as preventing the mucosal accumulation of carbonate precipitates taking place in the intestine of teleosts living in the sea. Furthermore, a raft of circulatory modifications occurs in rainbow trout heading to sea. Gastrointestinal blood flow, cardiac output and stroke volume began to increase after ~ 2 days in seawater and reached a level two-fold higher than in freshwater after 4 days, which was maintained in fully seawater-acclimated trout. The up-regulation of these cardiovascular processes is most likely essential for the maintenance of osmotic homeostasis and acid-base balance for teleosts living in the sea. My findings also suggest that the increased blood flow is mainly required for the transportation of products such as ions, water and metabolic wastes, as standard metabolic rate was not significantly affected. Furthermore, seawater-acclimated trout were still able to further increase gastrointestinal perfusion following a meal, although there were strong indications that these individuals were approaching their maximum threshold. In conclusion, the findings of this thesis enable a greater insight into the importance of gastrointestinal motility and blood flow during the processing of food and maintenance of osmotic homeostasis, which ultimately underlies the relative fitness of marine and euryhaline teleosts living in the sea...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{development}} of advanced coal-fired power conversion system often requires reliable and efficient cleanup devices that can remove particulate and gaseous pollutants from high-temperature, high- pressure gas streams. A novel filtration concept for particulate cleanup {{has been developed}} at the U. S. Department of Energy`s Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC). The filtration system consists of a fine metal screen filter immersed in a fluidized bed of granular material. As the gas stream passes through the fluidized bed, a layer of the bed granular material is entrained and deposited at the screen surface. This material provides a natural granular filter to separate fine particles from the gas stream passing through the bed. Since the filtering media is the granular material supplied by the fluidized bed, the filter is not subjected to blinding like candle filters. Because only the in-flowing gas, not fine particle cohesive forces, maintains the granular layer at the screen surface, once the thickness and permeability of the granular layer are stabilized, it remains unchanged {{as long as the}} in-flowing gas flow rate remains constant. The weight of the particles and the turbulent nature of the fluidized bed limits the thickness of the granular layer on the filter leading to a self-cleaning attribute of the filter. The granular filtration testing system consisted of a filter, a two-dimensional fluidized bed, a <b>continuous</b> powder <b>feeder,</b> a laser-based, in-line particle counting, sizing, and velocimeter (PCSV), and a continuous solid feeding/bed material withdrawal system. The two-dimensional, transparent fluidized bed allowed clear observation of the general fluidized state of the granular material and the conditions under which fines are captured by the granular layer...|$|R
40|$|Pressure feeder chutes are {{pieces of}} {{equipment}} used in sugar cane crushing {{to increase the amount}} of cane that can be put through a mill. The <b>continuous</b> pressure <b>feeder</b> was developed with the objective to provide a constant feed of bagasse under pressure to the mouth of the crushing mills. The pressure feeder chute is used in a sugarcane milling unit to transfer bagasse from one set of crushing rolls to a second set of crushing rolls. There have been many pressure feeder chute failures in the past. The pressure feeder chute is quite vulnerable and if the bagasse throughput is blocked at the mill rollers, the pressure build-up in the chute can be enormous, which can ultimately result in failure. The result is substantial damage to the rollers, mill and chute construction, and downtimes of up to 48 hours can be experienced. Part of the problem is that the bagasse behaviour in the pressure feeder chute is not understood well. If the pressure feeder chute behaviour was understood, then the chute geometry design could be modified in order to minimise risk of failure. There are possible avenues for changing pressure feeder chute design and operations with a view to producing more reliable pressure feeder chutes in the future. There have been previous attempts to conduct experimental work to determine the causes of pressure feeder chute failures. There are certain guidelines available, however pressure feeder chute failures continue. Pressure feeder chute behaviour still remains poorly understood. This thesis contains the work carried out between April 14 th 2009 and October 10 th 2012 that focuses on the design of an experimental apparatus to measure forces and visually observe bagasse behaviour in an attempt to understand bagasse behaviour in pressure feeder chutes and minimise the risk of failure...|$|R
