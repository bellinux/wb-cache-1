40|$|Current legal {{responses}} {{to the problem of}} human trafficking often reflect a deep reluctance to address the socioeconomic root causes of the problem. Because they approach trafficking as an act (or series of acts) of violence, most responses focus predominantly on prosecuting traffickers, and to a lesser extent, protecting trafficked persons. While such approaches might account for the consequences of trafficking, they tend to overlook the broader socioeconomic reality that drives trafficking in human beings. Against this backdrop, this article seeks to reframe trafficking as a migratory response to current globalizing socioeconomic trends. It argues that, to be effective, countertrafficking strategies must target the underlying conditions that impel people to accept dangerous labor migration assignments. The article recommends that existing counter-trafficking strategies be assessed with a view to assessing their potential for long-term effectiveness. It also advocates strategic use of the nondiscrimination principle to promote basic economic, social, and <b>cultural</b> rights, the <b>deprivation</b> of which has sustained the trafficking phenomenon.

40|$|Background: From the mid- 1990 s, UK governments {{developed}} partnerships {{to tackle}} drugs nationally and locally. Over time, increased resources focused on communities and localities in greatest need. This reflected {{growing awareness of}} the concentration of problems in deprived areas, with social and spatial segregation being a feature of post-industrial urban areas. Methods: A review of English drug policy since the 1990 s, drawing on:- analysis of documents; a review of sociological studies; an illustrative case-study of one northern town; interviews with local policy players; statistical analysis of key indicators {{with some of these}} data presented using Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping. Results: In-depth sociological studies demonstrate interconnections between historical patterns, socio-economic change, <b>cultural</b> complexity, <b>deprivation,</b> limited opportunities and illicit drugs. At local level, there are links between concentrated multiple deprivation, poor health, acquisitive crime and problematic drug use. Partnership policies, encouraged by the provision of ring-fenced funds, have been effective in containing problems. Underlying issues of inequality are however neglected in political debates. The article argues that post-industrial towns and cities are characterised by an increase in problems related to poverty and drugs. Both the real shape and perceptions of what is the problem change over time. In England, the profile of the problem drug user was described in a number of sociological studies conducted from the 1980 s onwards. Key features were the concentration of problems in certain social groups (such as the poorly educated or unemployed) and in certain areas (inner cities or outer estates). Responding to rising public concern, national drug strategies developed and the New Labour Government after 1997 prioritised the issue of drugs, directing increased resources to drug treatment with tight control over the use of these new monies through target setting and measurement of performance. The emphasis was on the most dangerous drugs and most disadvantaged areas. Conclusion: There is local variation in the pattern of problems and in implementation of national policies. In UK after 1997, New Labour policy aimed to promote a fair and cost-effective distribution of resources and improved availability and quality of treatment services and local policing. Tensions appeared between the drive to meet national targets and local perceptions of need. Ideas of localism, promoting market solutions and flexibility in provision, are now gaining ground in English social policy with the arrival of a Coalition (Conservative/Liberal Democrat) Government. These, together with an emphasis on abstinence and recovery, raise questions about the future adequacy of (a) attention to marginalised problems and stigmatised groups and (b) the distribution of resources in a context of severe fiscal restraint...|$|R
40|$|Migrants {{comprise}} a growing share of European populations. However, {{all too often}} their situation is compounded by immigration and citizenship regulations, socio-economic <b>deprivation,</b> <b>cultural</b> differences, language barriers and problems in realizing their human rights and in accessing health and other basic services. There {{is a need for}} tailored health policies, but robust data on the health needs of migrants and how best to meet them are scarce, partly because routine data on migrant health are only available in few European countries and understandings of who constitutes a migrant differ widely. Furthermore, the number of countries in Europe with well developed policies on the health of migrants is still small. This workshop will start bridging this information gap by presenting preliminary findings of a European research project undertaken in 2010 – 11 by the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, the EUPHA Section on Migrant and Ethnic Minority Health, and the International Organization for Migration. The project brings together available evidence on the health needs of migrants in the European Union and how these can be met most effectively. Particular attention is being paid to the health needs of the most vulnerable groups of migrants who also face the highest barriers to accessing services, such as asylum seekers, refugees, undocumented migrants and victims of trafficking. The workshop will explore four key topics of migration and health in the European Union. It will start with a review of the legal rights of migrants to health care and their implementation. This will be followed by an analysis of migrants’ access to health care. The last two presentations explore current migrant health policies in the European Union and examples of best practice of health care for migrants.

40|$|Brown rot {{can lead}} to {{considerable}} fruit losses in peach orchards and cultural practices likely to contend this major disease have to be promoted. In order to limit peach brown rot incidence in a three-year-old mid-season maturing peach orchard of the cultivar 'Ruby Bright', four combinations of irrigation and soil management treatments were assessed: conventional (Cony) irrigation (I) and soil management (S) (Convl+ConvS); modified (Mod) irrigation and soil management (Modl+ConvS); conventional irrigation and modified soil management (Convl+ModS); and modified irrigation and soil management (ModI+ModS). Conventional irrigation and soil management in the tree row consisted of irrigation scheduling using tensiometer readings and herbicide use, respectively. Modified irrigation and soil management in the tree row consisted of water deprivation during stage III of fruit development and ground cover with white clover, respectively. For four consecutive years (2010 - 2013), in {{the conditions of the}} Middle Rhone Valley in France, the lowest and highest brown rot incidence were detected under (Modl+ModS) and (Convl+ConvS), respectively, whereas brown rot incidence under (Modl+ConvS) and (Convl+ModS) was intermediate. This lower brown rot incidence under the modified treatments occurred from one to two weeks before fruit maturity and was still observed for several days in post-harvest storage. Ground cover with white clover was shown to limit water availability in the soil after heavy rainfall compared to bare soil, probably limiting peach growth variations, well-known as a possible source of detrimental micro cracks at the fruit surface. This suggests that under our conditions appropriate <b>cultural</b> practices, water <b>deprivation</b> and a clover crop cover in the tree row possibly decrease peach disease sensitivity, which might lead to the reduced use of pesticide sprays to control brown rot in the orchard...|$|R

The film was {{screened}} at the Berlin International Film Festival and was acclaimed and well received in West Germany {{as well as}} abroad. Years of Hunger takes place between 1953 and 1956, the formative years of the West German Wirtschaftswunder and [...] "portrays years of an emotional starved adolescent, Ursula Scheuner, {{growing up in the}} 'golden Fifties' in the midst of plenty." [...] Moreover, the film, again fictionalized autobiographic, [...] "precisely maps the complex cultural landscape of Brückner's youth: the nation's denial of the Nazi past, its division into East and West, the cold war, anticommunism, sexual repression, and bulimic consumerism." [...] The film focuses on two topics around the protagonist Ursula. On the one hand the mother-daughter relationship {{and on the other hand}} the difficulties of her in dealing with her restrictive environment. She is confronted with the sexual norms of her mother and with the mother's disgust with her own body. We witness the development of the protagonist's estranged relationship toward her body and her sexuality; Kosta describes this as [...] "the emergence of a self-destructive, self-hating female subjectivity". This alienation leads to self-mutilation, mutism and finally, to a suicide attempt by overeating. The film is inweaved with Brückner's own voice-over, inner monologues, poems and fantasies to illustrate the protagonist's inner life. Another formal play is the disruption of the narrative unity by documentary footage such as newsreels and photos from the period. A strong picture in this film is the shot of a bloody sanitary napkin. [...] "It is an emblem of all those things in women's lives that cannot be shown."

40|$|Excerpt] Although {{it is now}} {{two decades}} since the United Nations’ International Year of Disabled People, {{disabled}} people across the world still encounter severe economic, <b>cultural</b> and social <b>deprivations.</b> The problem is generally worse for those living in rural areas and is especially acute for all disabled people living in low income states. Clearly, health and rehabilitation {{can no longer be}} understood solely in terms of orthodox medical interventions and conventional notions of ‘care’. These centre almost exclusively on the perceived limitations of individuals rather than on society’s failure to accommodate disabled peoples’ needs. There is, therefore, an urgent need for an approach that cares not simply about disabled people but also about society and the way it is organized. Responding to this insight, the WHO ‘Rethinking Care’ initiative and Conference brought together disabled people and other stakeholders from high and low income countries to identify key issues and propose recommendations for member states to address this need. Recommendations included the recognition that member nations must adopt a holistic approach that includes the introduction of policies to eliminate poverty and secure equal access to all community based services and facilities. These include medical services, education, employment, housing, transport, public amenities etc. This must be accompanied by the introduction of comprehensive and enforceable anti-discrimination laws and policies to secure the active and meaningful involvement of disabled people and their organizations in all future policy developments. States must adopt a truly inclusive approach to these issues that addresses the needs of all disabled people equally. This includes disabled women, disabled children, and people with complex and/or multiple impairments with potentially high dependency needs. Access to medical and related services is a basic human right must not be determined by the ability to pay. With this in mind several important and practical recommendations were devised for the future implementation of the first four UN Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities. These concern medical, rehabilitation, and support services and awareness raising campaigns. Finally, the responsibility for introducing and financing these developments rests with national governments. But where necessary high-income states, international monetary institutions and transnational organizations, should make resources available to the governments of low-income countries to secure the successful implementation of these initiatives...|$|R
40|$|Mwanza Region in {{northern}} Tanzania {{is one of}} the poorest regions of the country. The economy of this region is mainly dependent on two industries: fishing and mining. Since both of these industries are confined in nature and won’t last forever, the city’s economy is in need of an additional industry that will provide the inhabitants of Mwanza with enough job opportunities for the city to sustain itself and hopefully develop further. Since Tanzania’s main export product is tourism and Mwanza lies only two hours away from the most visited safari attraction of the country: Serengeti National Park, tourism would be a good option. If managed in the right way, tourism could even create opportunities for the poorest of the poor, such as the street children and lepers in Mwanza. Up till now Mwanza has been missing out on the benefits of the thousands of tourists coming to Tanzania every year. So far Mwanza {{has not been able to}} compete with booming tourist destinations like Arusha and Zanzibar but within the city and its surroundings lay great opportunities for Mwanza to become one of the top tourist destinations in Tanzania. However, tourism does not only bring benefits to the local people. It can also do a lot of harm to the community, its culture and the environment. Examples from other countries and cities show us that revenues from tourism attractions often leak back to developed countries and only a very small percentage stays in the hosting country. There are examples to be found of tourism leading to <b>cultural</b> and economical <b>deprivation.</b> Therefore, it is important that the development of the tourism industry of Mwanza is guided in the right direction, in a way that makes sure the local people, including the poor, benefit first. During this study research has been conducted regarding the opportunities and obstacles that can be found in Mwanza City and its direct surroundings in respect of pro-poor tourism. The main research question has been: Which steps have to be taken to create a pro-poor tourism industry in Mwanza City and Mwanza Region? For the larger part the research has been an exploratory study so necessarily qualitative in nature. In depth interviews and observations have been used in order to get an image of the existing situation in Mwanza and the main opportunities and obstacles the tourism industry is facing. A number of case studies provide an insight in the lives of stakeholders of tourism in Mwanza. For the quantitative part short questionnaires have been used in order to find out the capacity of the attractions and facilities and the demand of the tourists. 	It has been found that the tourism industry in Mwanza, though still in its infancy, already holds the basis for a variety of attractions that could be developed into pro-poor tourist attractions. Moreover, there are a significant number of stakeholders present in Mwanza who are eager to change the situation. In this study a intervention-oriented roadmap has been developed that focuses on the creation of networks between stakeholders, improvement of education and training of stakeholders, revision of existing supply chains, innovation and development of new pro-poor attractions and routes, lobbying for governmental change, improvement of the regional infrastructure and building of a tourist friendly and pro-poor reputation...|$|R

Riesman's estimate, based on the proportion of the population designated as lower class, indicates that {{one out of every three}} school children is culturally deprived (Riesman, 1962). This emphasis on social class as a cause of <b>cultural</b> <b>deprivation</b> is also made by Davis and Havighurst (1946, p. 699) who state that "socio-economic status is believed to define and systematize different learning environments for children of different classes". These two excerpts from the literature reflect what is probably a wide spread concern in society, especially among those who are involved with problems of poverty, discrimination and ill­ness. Given an equalitarian, ethical basis of social action, it is essential, from a research point of view, to document the relation­ship between various aspects of childhood environment (such as <b>cultural</b> <b>deprivation,</b> socio-economic status) and achievement (such as academic grades, social and personal adjustment). Before these relationships can be studied, however, it is necessary to deal with the methodological problem of developing adequate measures. Neff (1928, p. 732) has stated that we possess "no standard and carefully worked up measure of this variable" (socio-economic status). Past measures have been inadequate in that they have dealt almost exclusively with economic factors [...] a decidedly superficial and often inaccurate approach, especially in the day of "take-now-pay-later" plans. People of vastly different earning power now own many of the same luxury items.

40|$|After a {{long period}} of neglect in American {{education}} the so-called disadvantaged or culturally deprived child has received, in recent years, his fair share of the discourse although perhaps not enough of the action. Riessman maintains that one third of the nation falls under this deprived category. Many writers use the term synonymously with the lower class, although Deutsch claims that <b>cultural</b> <b>deprivation</b> cuts across class lines, and he finds greater correlation of school with specific kinds of deprivation than with social class. The term cultural derivation is rejected by many because of its implication that a certain group has no culture. The American culture has common frames of reference of which one is the standards of the public school system. These standards happen to coincide with middle class values rather than lower class ones. Berelter declares that lower class values have not been promulgated in the schools because this "would be conceived as a means of depriving the poor of a chance to acquire cultural benefits necessary for improvement of their status. " <b>Cultural</b> <b>deprivation,</b> then, calls attention to those disadvantages considered as obstacles to educational goals. Whether or not we want to use this term, it is useful to bear in mind this middle class orientation to education and reflect upon how far we should extend it. Given that we are forced into a cumulative school-failure of so many children, we need to reevaluate our present approaches and restructure education so that everyone can benefit from It. This necessitates a study of intellectual development, the school environment and Its congruence with home values, and various theories about learning, and creation of a viable philosophy.

The attempted application of theory and postapplication analysis often bring these assumptions to the fore.

In this paper an effort is made to delineate some aspects of the relationship between applied social research and theory through the use of <b>cultural</b> <b>deprivation</b> theorizing and investigations. t appears that a part of the reluctance of more theoretically. JL oriented social scientists to engage in applied or policy-related research is the mistaken belief that such research is devoid of theory. If it is granted that such research is guided by theory, the theory is seen as being superficial and mindless, or at best inadequate for immediate application to the solution of a given social problem. This view of the relationship between applied research and social theory is only partially correct. While it is true that there is the use of rather superficial theory by some applied researchers, {{it is also true that}} much of such theory is also expounded by social researchers who do not engage in applied research. ’ The possibility of the application of theory may also cause researchers to engage in the use of more rigorous standards for assessing the adequacy of theory than those used by researchers who do not anticipate immediate application.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{attempts}} {{to explain why}} and how the Indian state {{has been successful in}} managing the militant form of Islamic fundamentalism in India, despite favourable internal and external conditions for such militancy. Internally, it includes such factors as the relative material and <b>cultural</b> <b>deprivation</b> of Indian Muslims, the context of Hindutava and the communal riots, and externally, the Islamic radical movements abroad. Varied literatures have emphasized these factors for the growth of Islamic fundamentalism and Islamic militancy across the Muslim world. However, India has not witnessed large-scale Islamic militancy, despite the growth in Islamic fundamentalist organizations. The article offers a theoretical perspective that takes into consideration the interplay of the nation-building process, the constitutional framework of minority rights, the doctrine of Indian secularism, and the democratic political process. This interplay explains the absence of large-scale militancy and violence, either on the part of Islamic fundamentalist groups/institutions or the Muslim population in India...|$|E

Since leisure boredom is consistently associated with different emotional and societal problems, concerns about the occurrence of leisure boredom {{are an integral part of}} this interest. Against that background, this paper studies social variation in boredom during leisure time and its consequences for life satisfaction among pupils following secondary education in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium; N = 1598). In general girls, younger pupils and pupils who are enrolled in vocational education experience leisure boredom more often. In-depth analyses, however, show interesting interaction effects between these characteristics. In addition, leisure boredom correlates positively with a weak social network and a lack of parental monitoring. After taking these characteristics into account there remains no direct relationship between material and <b>cultural</b> <b>deprivation</b> and the occurrence of leisure boredom. We also find that leisure boredom, even after taking into account many other characteristics of young people’s social, economic and cultural living environment, significantly predicts low life satisfaction. In the conclusion we discuss the implications of our findings...|$|E
