50|$|In the Middle Ages {{the area}} was used for archery practice.

40|$|Abstract. An {{enduring}} {{mystery in}} biology {{is how a}} physical entity simple enough to have arisen spontaneously could have evolved into the complex life seen on Earth today. Cairns-Smith has proposed that life might have originated in <b>clays</b> which <b>stored</b> genomes consisting of an arrangement of crystal monomers that was replicated during growth. While a clay genome is simple enough to have conceivably arisen spontaneously, it is not obvious how it might have produced more complex forms {{as a result of}} evolution. Here, we examine this possibility in the tile assembly model, a generalized model of crystal growth that has been used to study the self-assembly of DNA tiles. We describe hypothetical crystals for which evolution of complex crystal sequences is driven by the scarceness of resources required for growth. We show how, under certain circumstances, crystal growth that performs computation can predict which resources are abundant. In such cases, crystals executing programs that make these predictions most accurately will grow fastest. Since crystals can perform universal computation, the complexity of computation {{that can be used to}} optimize growth is unbounded. To the extent that lessons derived from the tile assembly model might be applicable to mineral crystals, our results suggest that resource scarcity could conceivably have provided the evolutionary pressures necessary to produce complex clay genomes that sense and respond to changes in their environment. ...|$|R

5000|$|One {{byproduct}} of the extraction process is <b>clay,</b> which is <b>stored</b> in settling ponds and eventually comprises 30%-40% of a mine site. Some of these ponds can measure thousands of acres. Rain drains slower through these clay-laden ponds than typical soil. Critics argue that this, in turn, reduces baseflow to the Peace River. Some {{studies have indicated that}} reclaimed lands actually provide a more consistent baseflow because the sandier soils of the reclaimed land provide faster baseflow, while the clay provides a slower steady flow, creating more flow during dry periods than native land. Since the 1960s, the average annual flow of the middle Peace River has declined from [...] to [...] per second (38.23 to 22.65 m³/s). Critics argue that this flow reduction is due to phosphate mining, but studies by the Southwest Florida Water Management District have shown that the reduction in flow is due to multidecadal oscillation in Atlantic Ocean temperatures.|$|R

Approximately once a week, the pesticide waters are pumped from the sumps into a mobile spray rig and sprayed onto a 15-20 acre plot on the Stoker site {{consisting of a}} dirt road leading to the airstrip. During the 1960s and 1970s, Stoker released approximately 300 gallons of waste water per day, but the California Regional Water Quality Control Board recently estimated that this was reduced to 100 gallons. The wash water has been determined to be non-hazardous. [...] On May 9, 1988 a pond located at a nearby residence near the site suffered a fish and bird kill. Numerous dead fish (shad and catfish) and ten dead birds (Snowy Egrets) were found {{around the perimeter of}} the pond. Upon necropsy, the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) determined the fish tissue was contaminated by high levels of several different pesticides. The CDFG analyzed the pond and concluded that high winds blew pesticides from the Stoker airplane cleaning activities into the pond. [...] After the discovery of dead birds and fish, the pond was closed to public activities due to the belief of contamination. Later in 1988, an on-site warehouse that contained pesticide supplies caught fire and burned to the ground.

40|$|Clays {{have been}} implicated in the origin of {{terrestrial}} life since the 1950 's. Originally they were considered agents which aid in selecting, concentrating and promoting oligomerization of the organic monomeric substituents of cellular life forms. However, more recently, {{it has been suggested}} that minerals, with particular emphasis on clays, may have played a yet more fundamental role. It has been suggested that clays are prototypic life forms in themselves and that they served as a template which directed the self-assembly of cellular life. If the clay-life theory is to have other than conceptual credibility, clays must be shown by experiment to execute the operations of cellular life, not only individually, but also in a sufficiently concerted manner as to produce some semblance of the functional attributes of living cells. Current studies are focussed on the ability of <b>clays</b> to absorb, <b>store</b> and transfer energy under plausible prebiotic conditions and to use this energy to drive chemistry of prebiotic relevance.

50|$|Where {{water is}} pumped or {{siphoned}} from {{a river of}} variable quality or quantity, bank-side reservoirs may be built to store the water. Such reservoirs are usually formed partly by excavation and partly by building a complete encircling bund or embankment, which may exceed 6 km (4 miles) in circumference. Both {{the floor of the}} reservoir and the bund must have an impermeable lining or core: initially these were often made of puddled clay, but this has generally been superseded by the modern use of rolled <b>clay.</b> The water <b>stored</b> in such reservoirs may stay there for several months, during which time normal biological processes may substantially reduce many contaminants and almost eliminate any turbidity. The use of bank-side reservoirs also allows water abstraction to be stopped for some time, when the river is unacceptably polluted or when flow conditions are very low due to drought. The London water supply system is one example of the use of bank-side storage: the water is taken from the River Thames and River Lee; several large Thames-side reservoirs such as Queen Mary Reservoir can be seen along the approach to London Heathrow Airport.|$|R

40|$|Influence {{of storage}} {{conditions}} on geotechnical properties of Ariake clay {{and on its}} chemical stabilization is investigated {{to make use of}} the surplus clay as construction materials. The influence factors in lime and cement stabilization including salts, diatom and clay minerals were studied. The experiments were set up by mixing clays with various proportions of studied factors. As a result, for Bangkok clay, Kaolin and Bentonite, the factors improving the unconfined compressive strength of cement-stabilized clay are diatom content, cement content, CaCl 2 and NaCl in descending order. Conversely, Kaolin and Bentonite are detrimental factors for Bangkok clay. For Ariake clay, the positive factors are only cement content and diatom content. In case of lime stabilization, for Ariake clay, the positive factors are only lime content and 5 % of NaCl. The different characteristics between Ariake and Bangkok clays after treating with various admixtures may be due to the differences in chemical properties. Sometimes, due to soil containing high organic, the soil stabilized by lime cannot yield high strength enough for construction. Organic matters have the tendency to coat the soil particles, causing the obstruction or delay of the pozzolanic reaction when the lime is introduced. However, the test results indicated that when sodium salt (NaCl) or calcium salt (CaCl 2) is added to the lime-organic clay mixture, the strength of mixture increases with increasing salt concentration. Finally, to investigate the effect of oxidation and drying on soil properties during storage, two series of laboratory testing on oxidation and drying effects were performed on Ariake <b>clays</b> that <b>stored</b> in the different conditions and periods. The results show that after storage, the properties of all samples were changed by oxidation or drying effect.

40|$|The {{development}} of effective sediment control or management strategies is heavily dependent upon {{identification of the}} main source or sources of the sediment causing the siltation, and/or the removal of sediment from the system. One of these management strategies is the regeneration and construction of wetlands to provide downstream sediment storage. This study investigates the proportions of potential sediment sources contrasting to the floodplain of the River Fal, under a range of floodplain management scenarios (e. g. Section 1 : dense vegetation; Section 2 : sparse woodland; Section 3 - 4 : intensive grazing, Section 5 rough grassland, and a Wetland). The sources; (1) china clay; (2) channel banks; (3) cultivated; and (4) pasture sediments were analysed using XRF (X-ray Fluorescence Analysis), statistically scrutinized to compile a unique sediment fingerprint, and then run with a mixing model to determine source proportions of the floodplain. The findings confirm {{the potential of the}} fingerprinting approach for establishing the proportions of china clay within a mined catchment, with a high contribution of china clay across the floodplain. Comparing floodplain management scenarios, china clay proportions varied from 60 ± 3 to 62 ± 4 % in Sections 1 & 2, 48 ± 2 to 34 ± 1 in sections 3 & 4 and 46 ± 2 within the wetland. It was found that the principle parameter determining china <b>clay</b> proportions <b>stored</b> was topography, in comparison to vegetation type/amount, which largely effected flow velocity and sediment deposition rates. Restoring a wetland could therefore reduce the proportional capability of Sections 1 & 2 in <b>storing</b> china <b>clay</b> sediments.

Therefore, to predict the effects of wetland regeneration on china clay and other sediment sources, it is imperative that sediment accretion data are obtainedFaculty of Science & Technolog...|$|R
40|$|The {{soil cover}} of the world stores more carbon than that present in biomass and in the atmosphere, so the depth and {{distribution}} of soil organic matter (SOM) might be important in point of carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. Texture, among several other factors, {{plays an important role}} in the distribution of SOM. Most national and the main international soil classification systems (Soil Taxonomy, World Reference Base for Soil Resources) have a separate unit for high clay content soils on the highest level of classification, as Vertisols. Due to the high swelling clay content, these soils open deep cracks when they are dry. During the process called “pedoturbation”, the high SOM content surface material falls into the cracks, where it accumulates and mixes with subsoil, and enhances the accumulation of SOM in great depth. Although the effect of texture on the stabilization, distribution and properties of SOM have been investigated, only little information is available on SOM distribution in high clay content soils. The objective of the present study was to analyze the vertical distribution of SOM in high clay content soils of Hungary. Our results, based on the investigations of the Hungarian TIM database supported the hypothesis that high <b>clay</b> content soils <b>store</b> significantly more SOM and in greater depth than other soils under similar climatic conditions...|$|R
