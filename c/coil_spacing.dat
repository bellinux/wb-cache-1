40|$|Inductive {{powering}} for implanted medical devices, such as implantable biosensors, is a {{safe and}} effective technique that allows power to be delivered to implants wirelessly, avoiding the use of transcutaneous wires or implanted batteries. Wireless powering is very sensitive {{to a number of}} link parameters, including coil distance, alignment, shape, and load conditions.

This paper presents an optimum frequency tracking (OFT) method, in which an inductive power link is driven at a frequency that is maintained at an optimum value to ensure that the link is working at resonance, and the output voltage is maximised.

The OFT method does not require the use of variable capacitors or inductors. When tested at frequencies around a nominal frequency of 5 MHz, the OFT method provides up to a twofold efficiency improvement compared to a fixed frequency drive.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{environmental}} assessment of industrial areas {{is required to}} minimize the risk of soil and groundwater contamination. The survey of wide areas (e. g., some hectares) provides a high economical and complex logistical impact when random strategies of soil sampling are adopted. Recently, geophysical methods had been successfully adopted to drive the process of the spatial sampling of the soil. Approach: The main goal was to verify the reliability of the geophysics for the detection of buried wastes in an industrial area previously involved in the vehicle demolition. Two geophysical methods were applied (1) the electromagnetic frequency domain, using a multi-frequency broadband system with a fixed spacing between the transmitter and receiver coils (2 m) to observe the soil electrical conductivity and in-phase response (2) the electrical resistivity and chargeability tomographies, performed along several transects. We applied the Kriging method to map the conductivity and the in-phase response. Standard inversion procedure was adopted to interpret the resistivity and chargeability data. Results: We found a very similar response of the electromagnetic survey in range between 2000 and 40. 000 Hz: The investigation depth (3 - 4 m) was mainly related to the <b>coil</b> <b>spacing.</b> The survey pointed out some anomalies caused by bio-geochemical activity in the active waste deposits. The resistivity and chargeability sections confirmed that the electromagnetic anomalies were related to the waste. The high chargeability values (up to 100 mV/V) were associated to the leakages of metals of the wastes. Conclusion: The electromagnetic survey, even if sensitive to the presence of cultural noise (fence, metallic object on the ground), permitted to detect the industrial waste; the electrical resistivity and chargeability data pointed out the main contaminated zones with good accuracy. The further development may focus on the relationship between the nature of waste and the geophysical response...|$|E

This {{is evident in}} the hundreds of sinkholes, a well-developed epikarst surface, and by the presence o f caves and springs in the area. Groundwater probably moves primarily through conduits and fissures in the bedrock in a complex groundwater flow system. The City of Columbia Municipal Landfill is located in, or on the edge of, this karst area. The landfill, primarily containing construction waste, is being closed, and monitoring wells need to intercept any landfill leachate. The area around the landfill was initially investigated by mapping fractures from rock exposures, sinkhole orientations, and lineaments. Major fractures trend approximately N 60 °E and N 40 °W. Electrical geophysical methods were then employed to locate subsurface fractures that might be good locations for monitoring wells. Electromagnetic (EM) profiling with horizontal loops (vertical dipole) and a 33 ft (10 m) <b>coil</b> <b>spacing</b> recorded conductivity anomalies o f about 5 to 15 mS/m elongated in approximately N 60 °E or N 40 °W directions. Using coils oriented vertically (horizontal dipole) with a 33 ft (10 m) spacing (which “ sees” only about half as deep) these northeast- and northwest-trending anomalies do not show up. This suggests the vertical dipole anomalies are from enlarged fractures at, or just below the bedrock surface, and not from shallow soil structure or waste outside the landfill. An electrical resistivity 2 -D cross-section shows an undulating bedrock surface between the low resistivity soil (40 - 50 Qm) and the high resistivity limestone (over 1000 fim) with increased depth to bedrock in the conductive zones mapped with EM methods.

HCC uses a continuous absorber inside superconducting magnets which produce solenoidal field superimposed with transverse helical dipole and helical gradient fields.

This paper presents the design issues of the high field section of HCC with coil separation. The effect of <b>coil</b> <b>spacing</b> on the longitudinal and transverse field components is presented {{and its impact on}} the muon cooling discussed. The paper also describes methods for field corrections and their practical limits. The magnetic performance of the helical solenoid with coil separation was discussed in this work.

The design that is currently being considered is the one that has the poorest magnetic performance because it presents ripples in all three components, in particular in the helical gradient which could be quite large. Moreover, the average gradient could be off, which could affect the cooling performance. This work summarized methods to tune the gradient regarding the average value and the ripple. The coil longitudinal thickness and the helix period can be used to tune G. Thinner coils tend to reduce the ripples and also bring G to its target value. However, this technique reduces dramatically the operational margin. Wider coils can also reduce the ripple (not as much as thinner coils) and also tune the gradient to its target value.

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors William Beckman and Sanford Klein; 255 pp. The use of simulations can greatly aid in optimizing the design of natural convection heat exchangers (NCHEs) in solar domestic hot water (SDHW) systems. Fraser et al. (1992) presented a NCHE model that {{is used in the}} WATSUN solar simulation program, that requires experimental measurements of the heat exchanger thermal performance and shear pressure losses. Two TRNSYS models are here presented for a NCHE in a SDHW loop. The simple model, based on Fraser et al. 's work, requires experimental testing on the particular heat exchanger. The simple model can be used for optimizing SDHW system parameters (i. e. pipe lengths and diameters, collector areas, tank volume etc.) excluding the NCHE itself which is represented by the experimental curves. A detailed model, based upon cross flow correlations, requires geometric specifications of the NCHE being simulated and is applicable to shell and coil and counterflow configurations. By varying heat exchanger geometric parameters (such as the number of helices, diameters of helices, diameter and length of the heat exchanger shell) the detailed model can be used to design an optimum NCHE. Results comparing the detailed model with Fraser et al. 's experiments show reasonable agreement. Using the detailed model and the least cost savings economic analysis, simulations were performed to discover the optimal shell and coil NCHE geometry. It was found that considerably reducing the heat exchanger size led to enhanced economic performance over a 10 year period of economic analysis. <b>Coil</b> <b>spacing</b> and tube diameter had a lesser impact upon system performance than heat exchanger shell length and number of helices. Thermo Dynamics Inc. manufactures a shell and coil NCHE that contains 4 coils and is 0. 635 m. The optimal heat exchanger design contains 2 helices and is 0. 45 m long. For a given set of system parameters, a SDHW system containing the optimally designed heat exchanger would save the consumer an extra $ 110 in initial equipment cost, and $ 52 over a 10 year period. Heat exchanger designs were subject to variations in system parameters, such as collector area, hot water draw, location and glycol flow rate. Although each set of system parameters suggested a different optimal design, overall, the optimal design found for the initial set of system parameters remained adequate. As different economic assumptions will lead to differing optimal heat exchanger lengths, this work can serve as a guide for those who desire to optimize a shell and coil NCHE based upon a prevailing set of economic assumptions...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic {{induction}} (EMI) is {{a popular}} technique which has been intensively used for more than 30 years for rapid and non invasive characterisation of soil physico-chemical properties through the measurement of soil apparent electrical conductivity. Soil apparent electrical conductivity is influenced by several factors, mainly soil water content, clay content, salinity and temperature, and to a lower extent, mineralogy, porosity, structure, cation exchange capacity, organic matter and bulk density. This integrative dimension of soil apparent electrical conductivity makes EMI useful {{for a wide range}} of environmental applications implying the assessment of one or several of these soil properties and their spatiotemporal distribution at the field scale. The vertical spatial sensitivity of the EMI sensor to soil electrical conductivity and the depth of investigation are key factors for quantitative analyses in such studies. Classically, the response signal of the instruments is processed using an asymptotic approximation of Maxwell’s equations valid for low-induction-number (LIN) conditions, corresponding to a very small value of the ratio between the transmitter-receiver coil separation and the skin depth (i. e., the depth at which the primary magnetic field has been attenuated to 1 /exp of its original strength). Under the LIN assumption, the ratio of the secondary magnetic field to the primary magnetic field is linearly proportional to the soil apparent electrical conductivity, and the sensor vertical spatial sensitivity and investigation depth only depend on <b>coil</b> <b>spacing</b> and orientation (i. e., vertically or horizontally oriented). However, divergences from LIN conditions are likely to arise in moderately high conductive soil areas and the preceding statements may not hold anymore. In particular, influences of the soil electrical conductivity and frequency on the vertical spatial sensitivity and investigation depth are theoretically possible in such situations, leading to erroneous analyses and data interpretation if not properly accounted for. We conducted synthetic experiments in order to investigate and quantify the effects of the different factors likely to affect EMI sensor vertical spatial sensitivity and investigation depth and to identify conditions for which the LIN approximation holds. The EMI signal was modelled from an exact solution of the three-dimensional Maxwell’s equations for wave propagation in a horizontally multilayered medium. For this analysis, we examined different configurations for a two-layered subsurface, considering contrasted values for the two layer electrical conductivities within the range encountered for soils and varying the thickness of the first layer. For each of these configurations, several frequencies and transmitter-receiver coil separations were studied, encompassing the ranges of corresponding parameters found for the current EMI systems. Moreover, the effects of the orientation and of the height of the instrument above the soil surface were also analysed. These results bring interesting insights on the influence of both soil and sensor characteristics on the sensitivity with depth of the EMI signal and on the investigation depth, and point out situations for which the LIN approximation should be carefully considered. This study situates in the framework of the development of a new EMI approach, based on zero-offset co-planar coils and full-waveform inversion for exact parameter retrieval...|$|E

In species with a wide, open umbilicus, such as the heath snail (Helicella itala), the spiral of the whorls can be clearly viewed by looking into the umbilicus.|$|R
40|$|Mulher de 60 anos, com angina progressiva e revascularização do miocárdio, há oito anos, com ponte de veia safena para coronária direita e anastomose de artéria mamaria esquerda para artéria descendente anterior. Submetida a implante de stent Gianturco-Roubin II em terço {{proximal}} da ponte de veia safena para artéria coronária direita, com resultado insatisfatório pela persistência de lesão residual, provavelmente, decorrente de prolapso para dentro da luz de material aterosclerótico através dos coils. Foi implantado outro stent (Palmaz-Schatz biliar) dentro do stent GRII com sucesso e ótimo resultado angiográfico. Um 2 º stent Palmaz-Schatz biliar foi implantado em lesão distal no corpo da ponte, ultrapassando os dois stents, anteriormente implantados, com sucesso. Em algumas situações, implante de stent dentro de outro stent é recurso útil para otimização de resultado angiográfico do implante de um stent. A 60 year-old {{woman with}} progressive angina {{who had been}} submitted to saphenous bypass-graft to right coronary artery and a left mammary artery graft to anterior descending artery eight years previously, underwent implantation of a Gianturco Roubin II stent in the proximal third of the saphenous vein graft. The result was suboptimal by persistence of a residual stenosis probably due to prolapse of atherosclerotic material through the <b>coil</b> <b>spaces.</b> Another stent (Palmaz-Schatz biliar stent) was implanted at the previously stented site with no residual stenosis. Another Palmaz-Schatz biliar stent was successfully implanted in the distal body of the graft to treat another lesion (passing through the previously stents without difficulty). Stenting a stent, in selected situations, is a useful tool to optimize the angiographic result of stent implantation...|$|R
