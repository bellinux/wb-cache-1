Monazite is commonly present as accessory mineral in low-CaO peraluminous granitoids, from diorites, micaceous granites to pegmatites. The reason of the low <b>CaO</b> <b>content</b> is probably that melts with high <b>CaO</b> <b>content</b> promotes the formation of apatite and allanite but not monazite. It is commonly formed from the magmatism involving carbonatic melts but not mafic plutons or lavas. Those rocks usually host economic REE ore deposits, making monazite geochronology important in mining exploration.|$|E

Thermal analysis, XRD, dissolution, EDX, density, H-NMR and ion release studies were conducted in order to compare the data obtained from both groups.

30|$|Thus, {{a second}} level of {{explanation}} {{relates to the}} technology of amphora production in the workshop and its evolution through time. Clay bodies are seldom made from a naturally occurring single source of clay sediment. Sometimes quite numerous and complex paste preparation steps are introduced in the chaîne opératoire of the ceramic product. Amphora production is generally regarded as involving minimal paste preparation since the quantities of raw materials needed to ensure a large output would be considerable. Potters are thus supposed to select the most convenient clay material available i.e. one that needs little or no preparation. Nevertheless, this rather simplistic view should not dismiss the fact that addition or removal of non-plastics and clay mixing might have taken place, sometimes in sizeable proportions, which would greatly affect chemical results.

Pyrometallurgical processing currently offers the most attractive routes to perform the initial separation before the usual hydrometallurgical refining steps to produce high purity metals and compounds. There is a lack of information on the way valuable metals in WEEE behave during smelting because the combination of metals in WEEE is frequently different to that found in natural ores. In this first paper the slag/metal distribution ratio of tin between FeOx-CaO-SiO 2 slags and copper was examined at an oxygen partial pressure of 10 - 8 MPa (10 - 7 atm) and at 1300 C.

Six type of mortars used in the Roman settlement of Thamusida (50 km north of Rabat, Morocco) were investigated through X-ray powder-diffraction and Rietveld refinement, optical microscopy, image analysis, scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and combined differential thermal, and thermo-gravimetric analysis (DT-TGA).

40|$|Metasomatism of the lithospheric mantle by subduction-related fluids/melts is {{recorded}} in the Early Cretaceous Xinkailing high magnesium andesites (HMAs) from Western Liaoning. Olivine -hosted melt inclusions within the Xinkailing HMAs are alkaline and record a much lower SiO 2 content and higher Al 2 O 3 and <b>CaO</b> <b>contents</b> than the sub-alkaline bulk rock compositions. These observed compositional differences between bulk rocks and melt inclusions suggest that a crustally derived, high-SiO 2 melt was incorporated in the Xinkailing HMAs within the pre-eruptive magma chamber. The process of this incorporation accounts for the compositional differences between upper (HMAs) and lower (high magnesium basalts) successions of the Yixian Formation.

Based {{on the fact that}} bulk rocks record low Ni contents, whereas olivine crystals record a steep correlation between Fo and Ni and low <b>CaO</b> and CaO/FeO <b>contents,</b> in addition to the likely considerable depression of the olivine liquidus temperature, we argue that a hydrous (2 - 6 % H 2 O) orthopyroxene-rich pyroxenite source was formed by the reaction between subducted slab-released SiO 2 -rich fluids and overlying mantle peridotite. We further propose that during a series of Phanerozoic successive subduction events around the Eastern NCC, a significant amount of water may have been transported to the lithospheric mantle, thus lowering its viscosity and ultimately destabilizing the cratonic lithosphere.

It consists of two distinct pumice populations (‘A’- and ‘B’-type) that can be recognized only by detailed geochemical work. The pumice and the host ignimbrite have a similar mineral assemblage involving quartz, plagioclase, biotite and sporadic Kfeldspar. Zircon, allanite, apatite and ilmenite occur as accessory minerals. The distinct pumice types are recognized by their different trace element compositions and the different <b>CaO</b> <b>contents</b> of their groundmass glasses. Plagioclase has an overlapping composition; however, biotite shows bimodal composition. Based on trace element and major element modeling, a derivation of ‘A’-type rhyolite magma from the ‘B’-type magma by fractional crystallization is excluded. Thus, the two pumice types represent two isolated rhyolite magma batches, possibly residing in the same crystal mush. Coeval remobilization of the felsic magmas might be initiated by intrusion of hot basaltic magma into the silicic magma reservoir The rapid ascent of the foaming rhyolite magmas enabled only a short-lived interaction and thus, a syn-eruptive mingling between the two magma batches...|$|R

Indium was inferred to be present in slag as InO 1 ? 5. The activity coefficient of InO 1 ? 5 was calculated and presented as iso-activity coefficient curves on the copper-saturated FeOx-CaO- SiO 2 phase diagram. Volatilisation of indium under the oxidising conditions used in this work was insignificant, and it was shown that this is consistent with theoretical expectations. Only in much lower oxygen partial pressure environments can indium volatilisation be expected...|$|E
40|$|A petrological {{study was}} carried out on Mg-skarn-bearing dunite cumulates {{that are part of}} the Neo-Proterozoic Ioko-Dovyren {{intrusion}} (North Baikal region, Russia). Skarn xenoliths contain brucite pseudomorphs after periclase, forsterite and Cr-poor spinel. Fine-grained forsterite-spinel skarns occur with the brucite skarns or as isolated schlieren. Field relationships reveal that the Mg-skarns formed from silica-poor dolomitic xenoliths by interaction with the mafic magma of the Ioko-Dovyren intrusion. Rapid heating of dolomitic xenoliths by the mafic magma caused the decomposition of dolomite into calcite + periclase, releasing much CO 2. Further heating quantitatively melted the calcite. A periclase-rich restite was left behind after extraction of the low-density, low-viscosity calcite melt. The extracted calcite melt mixed with the surrounding mafic melt. This resulted in crystallization of olivine with <b>CaO</b> <b>contents</b> up to 1. 67 wt %. A local decrease in the silica concentration stabilized CaAl 2 SiO 6 -rich clinopyroxene. Brucite/periclase-free forsterite-spinel skarns probably originated by crystallization from the mafic melt close to the xenoliths at elevated fO(2). The high fO(2) was caused by CO 2 -rich fluids released during the decomposition of the xenoliths. The above case study provides the first evidence for partial melting of dolomite xenoliths during incorporation by a mafic magma...|$|R
40|$|Ne•v {{data are}} {{presented}} concerning the petrography and geochemistry of the Paleoproterozoic Hotazel iron-formation f the Kalahari manganese fi ld, South Africa. Mineralogically and texturally, the Hotazel iron-formation {{is very similar}} to Paleoproterozoic banded iron-formations of the Superior type, comprising laminae of chert, iron oxides (magnetite, hematite), iron silicates (greenalite, minnesotaitc, stilpnomelane, riebeckite, Fe mica), carbonates (calcite, ankerite, minor siderite), and pyrite. The major chemical constituents of the Hotazel rocks are SiOs, Fe oxides, CaO, and MgO, whereas MnO, AlsO. •, Na• 20, and K.,O contents are negligible (below 1 wt %). Elements of detrital derivation (Ti, Zr, Rb) and transition metals such as Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, and V are present in low concentrations, on the order of a few tens of parts per million. Stratigraphically higher, the Hotazel banded iron-formation shows aconspicuous increase in <b>CaO</b> <b>contents</b> that is coupled with a subtle decrease inbulk-rock Fe number ratios (FeZ+/(Fe •'+ + Fe 3 +)), implying a gradual transition to a more oxidizing environment. Shale-normalized rare earth dement (REE) patterns {{are similar to those of}} older banded iron-formations of the Transvaal Supergroup, exhibiting light REE depletion and negative Ce anomalies comparable tomodern shallow-level seawater. Occasional weak positive Eu anomalies in iron sificate-rich rocks indicate minor admixtures of a hydrothermal component below the chemocline...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSpinel-bearing lherzolite xenoliths {{from the}} Hosséré Garba (1272 m. a. s. l) volcano on the Adama-wa Plateau, {{is located in}} Likok village, at about 35 km to WSW of Ngaoundéré. These xenoliths (~ 11 cm size) have been sampled into the host basaltic lava flows from the NE flank of the Hosséré Garba volcano. These xenoliths {{characterized}} by porphyroclastic texture consisted of olivine (~ 55 vol. %), orthopyroxene (~ 19 vol. %) and clinopyroxene (~ 21 vol. %) crystals. Spinel crystals (~ 5 vol. %) are red brown and interstitial between the crystals of olivine and pyroxenes. <b>CaO</b> <b>contents</b> are low (< 0. 08 wt%) in olivine and similar to those estimated (CaO: 0. 05 - 0. 1 wt%) for the mantle origin. The values of Al VI /Al IV ratio range between 1. 1 and 1. 3 for the Cr-diopside crystals from Hosséré Garba xenoliths. The constant value of the volumes V(Cell) and V(M 1) for clinopyroxene compositions, indicates the similar pressures. Hosséré Garba represents a residual sequence is-sued from partial melting of a mantle source. Similar compositions have been recorded in miner-als of ultramafic xenoliths from other ultramafic xenoliths domains of the Cameroon Line and the Adamawa Plateau...|$|R
