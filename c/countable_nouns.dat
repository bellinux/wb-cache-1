2500|$|The {{singular}} and plural {{forms of}} loanwords from other languages where <b>countable</b> <b>nouns</b> used attributively are, unlike English, plural and {{come at the}} end of the word are sometimes modified when entering English usage. For example in Spanish, nouns composed of a verb and its plural object usually have the verb first and noun object last (e.g. the legendary monster [...] chupacabras, literally [...] "sucks-goats", or in a more natural English formation [...] "goatsucker") and the plural form of the object noun is retained in both the singular and plural forms of the compound (i.e. singular el chupacabras, plural los chupacabras). However when entering English, the final s of chupacabras was treated as a plural of the compound (i.e. the monster) rather than of the object of the verb (i.e. the goats), and so [...] "chupacabra" [...] without an s is the singular in English, even though in Spanish chupacabra could literally be construed as a creature that sucks only one single goat.|$|E
50|$|The Spanish {{language}} has nouns that express concrete objects, groups and classes of objects, qualities, feelings and other abstractions. All nouns have a conventional grammatical gender. <b>Countable</b> <b>nouns</b> inflect for number (singular and plural). However, {{the division between}} uncountable and <b>countable</b> <b>nouns</b> is more ambiguous than in English.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} entitled “Nouns in English and Tetun Language (Contrastive Analysis) {{is written}} {{to fulfill the}} requirement in finish the study in English Department, Faculty of Humanities Sam Ratulangi University. The aims of this research are to classify and describe kinds of nouns that contain in English and Tetun language. The researches of nouns in English are common nowadays, people can find them easily on grammar book or in internet, while the research of nouns in Tetun language is not common. Therefore, by this research, people {{can learn more about}} nouns in Tetun language that is contrasted with English. The theories that used in this research are from Frank (1972) and Lado (1979) concept. In this case, data classification and description, the kind of nouns explained as follows: proper noun, concrete or abstract <b>noun,</b> <b>countable</b> or noncountable <b>noun</b> and collective noun. The result of this research shows that the nouns in English and Tetun language are the same; they have the same kinds of nouns looking from the meaning. But, there is also a difference between these two languages. The difference is at the <b>countable</b> <b>noun.</b> In English, a <b>countable</b> <b>noun</b> show by addition –s in the end of the word to show the plural, while in Tetun language, the <b>countable</b> <b>noun</b> show by number. There are similarities and differences of kinds of nouns between these two languages that found in this research. So that, the writer suggest to all the readers who interest to learn more about Tetun language can read this research or do a research in Tetun language further. _______________________...|$|R
5000|$|Set partitives contain plural <b>countable</b> <b>nouns</b> {{in their}} {{embedded}} noun phrase (NP), {{and can be}} combined with quantifier determiners such as [...] "many", and specific numbers such as [...] "three". Entity partitives can contain either singular <b>countable</b> <b>nouns</b> or mass nouns (and sometimes even plural <b>countable</b> <b>nouns),</b> combining with determiners such as ‘much’, or those with a fractional meaning, like ‘half’. Other determiners can be combined with either type of partitive, including ‘some’, ‘many’, and ‘all’. The following {{is a list of}} different quantifier determiners in English and their classification as either participating in entity partitives, set partitives, or both: ...|$|E

2500|$|A suffix -j {{following}} the noun or adjective suffixes -o or -a makes a word plural. Without this suffix, a <b>countable</b> <b>noun</b> {{is understood to}} be singular. Direct objects take an accusative case suffix -n, which goes after any plural suffix. (The resulting sequence -ojn rhymes with English coin, and -ajn rhymes with fine.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Chad {{refers to}} {{fragments}} sometimes created when holes {{are made in}} a paper, card or similar synthetic materials, such as computer punched tape or punched cards. [...] "Chad" [...] has been used both as a mass noun (as in [...] "a pile of chad") and as a <b>countable</b> <b>noun</b> (pluralizing as in [...] "many chads").|$|R
500|$|The term comics {{refers to}} the comics medium when used as an {{uncountable}} noun and thus takes the singular: [...] "comics is a medium" [...] rather than [...] "comics are a medium". [...] When comic appears as a <b>countable</b> <b>noun</b> it refers to instances of the medium, such as individual comic strips or comic books: [...] "Tom's comics are in the basement." ...|$|R
5000|$|The numeral [...] "one" [...] {{also has}} a plural form, used with pluralia tantum: одни джинсы/одни часы [...] "one pair of jeans, one clock". The same form is used with <b>countable</b> <b>nouns</b> in meaning [...] "only": Кругом одни идиоты [...] "There are only idiots around".|$|E
50|$|Nouns can {{be divided}} into those that are {{countable}} and those that are not. In general, this correlates with the possibility for plural marking: <b>Countable</b> <b>nouns</b> can be marked for dual or plural; if not so marked, they are assumed to be singular. Uncountable nouns cannot be pluralized.|$|E
50|$|Count nouns or <b>countable</b> <b>nouns</b> {{are common}} nouns {{that can take}} a plural, can combine with numerals or {{counting}} quantifiers (e.g., one, two, several, every, most), and can take an indefinite article such as a or an (in languages which have such articles). Examples of count nouns are chair, nose, and occasion.|$|E
50|$|As in many east Asian languages, {{classifiers}} or measure {{words are}} required when using numerals (and sometimes other {{words such as}} demonstratives) with nouns. There are many different classifiers in the language, and each <b>countable</b> <b>noun</b> generally has a particular classifier associated with it. Informally, however, it is often acceptable to use the general classifier 个 個 ge in place of other specific classifiers.|$|R
50|$|In linguistics, a count <b>noun</b> (also <b>countable</b> <b>noun)</b> is a noun {{that can}} be {{modified}} by a numeral and that occurs in both singular and plural forms, and that co-occurs with quantificational determiners like every, each, several, etc. A mass noun has none of these properties, because it cannot be modified by a numeral, cannot occur in plural, and cannot co-occur with quantificational determiners.|$|R
5000|$|The name {{given to}} a {{grammatical}} category (as an uncountable noun) is generally also used (as a <b>countable</b> <b>noun)</b> to denote any of the possible values for that category. For example, the values available in a given language for the category [...] "tense" [...] are called [...] "tenses", the values available for the category [...] "gender" [...] are called [...] "genders", and so on.|$|R
50|$|Wichita <b>countable</b> <b>nouns</b> {{are divided}} into those that are {{collective}} {{and those that are}} not. The collective category includes most materials, such as wood; anything that normally comes in pieces, such as meat, corn, or flour; and any containers such as pots, bowls, or sacks when they are filled with pieces of something.|$|E
50|$|The {{indefinite}} article a (before a consonant sound) or an (before a vowel sound) is {{used only}} with singular, <b>countable</b> <b>nouns.</b> It {{indicates that the}} referent of the noun phrase is one unspecified member of a class. For example, the sentence An ugly man was smoking a pipe does not refer to any specifically known ugly man or pipe.|$|E
50|$|Some {{can also}} be used with {{singular}} <b>countable</b> <b>nouns,</b> as in There is some person on the porch, which implies that the identity of the person is unknown to the speaker (which is not necessarily the case when a(n) is used). This usage is fairly informal, although singular countable some {{can also be}} found in formal contexts: We seek some value of x such that...|$|E
5000|$|In English, {{such words}} {{are almost always}} mass nouns. Some {{uncountable}} nouns can be alternatively used as count nouns when meaning [...] "a type of", and the plural means [...] "more than one type of". For example, strength is uncountable in Strength is power, {{but it can be}} used as a <b>countable</b> <b>noun</b> to mean type of strength as in My strengths are in physics and chemistry. Some words, especially proper nouns such as the name of an individual, are nearly always in the singular form because there is only one example of what that noun means.|$|R
5000|$|The {{languages}} of the Tanoan family have three numbers - singular, dual, and plural - and exhibit an unusual system of marking number, called [...] "inverse number" [...] (or number toggling). In this scheme, every <b>countable</b> <b>noun</b> has {{what might be}} called its [...] "inherent" [...] or [...] "expected" [...] numbers, and is unmarked for these. When a noun appears in an [...] "inverse" [...] (atypical) number, it is inflected to mark this. Therefore, Jemez nouns take the ending -sh to denote an inverse number; there are four noun classes which inflect for number as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|The prop-word {{one takes}} {{the place of}} a <b>countable</b> <b>noun</b> in a noun phrase (or {{determiner}} phrase), normally in a context where it is clear which noun it is replacing. For example, in a context in which hats are being talked about, the red one means [...] "the red hat", and the ones we bought means [...] "the hats we bought". The prop-word thus functions somewhat similarly to a pronoun, except that a pronoun usually {{takes the place of}} a whole noun (determiner) phrase (for example, [...] "the red hat" [...] may be replaced by the pronoun it).|$|R
5000|$|Nouns are {{sometimes}} classified semantically (by their meanings) as proper nouns and common nouns (Cyrus, China vs. frog, milk) or as concrete nouns and abstract nouns (book, laptop vs. heat, prejudice). A grammatical distinction is often made between count (<b>countable)</b> <b>nouns</b> such as clock and city, and non-count (uncountable) nouns such as milk and decor. Some nouns can function both as countable and as uncountable {{such as the}} word [...] "wine" [...] (This is a good wine, I prefer red wine).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Countable</b> <b>nouns</b> {{generally}} have singular and plural forms. In {{most cases the}} plural is formed from the singular by adding -es (as in dogs, bushes), although there are also irregular forms (woman/women, foot/feet, etc.), including cases where the two forms are identical (sheep, series). For more details, see English plural. Certain nouns {{can be used with}} plural verbs even though they are singular in form, as in The government were ... (where the government is considered to refer to the people constituting the government). This is a form of synesis; it is more common in British than American English. See [...]|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "universal packager" [...] {{likewise}} {{describes how}} mass nouns are understood {{when they are}} used as <b>countable</b> <b>nouns.</b> In this case, the plural noun may be understood as naming individual servings or [...] "packages" [...] (e.g. two coffees may mean [...] "two cups of coffee"), or as naming abstract kinds (two coffees can also refer to e.g. Colombian coffee and Indonesian coffee). Some scholars use the phrase universal packager to refer to both the concrete and abstract understanding of plural nouns; others use it to refer only to the concrete sense, and use universal sorter for abstract meaning.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1700s and early 1800s, during the French Revolution, [...] "civilization" [...] {{was used in}} the singular, never in the plural, and meant the {{progress}} of humanity as a whole. This is still the case in French. The use of [...] "civilizations" [...] as a <b>countable</b> <b>noun</b> was in occasional use in the 19th century, but has become much more common in the later 20th century, sometimes just meaning culture (itself in origin an uncountable <b>noun,</b> made <b>countable</b> in the context of ethnography). Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a [...] "medieval civilization", which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron.|$|R
5000|$|The Gay Daleks: A {{series of}} crass {{interactions}} between two Michael Portillo obsessed, gay Daleks, travelling in a space/time machine called [...] "The Turdis" [...] (a {{play on the}} TARDIS and [...] "turd", a <b>countable</b> <b>noun</b> {{for a piece of}} faeces), during the sketches, the pair treat their relationship with an argumentative, tense approach which often is ridden with their addressing relationship problems, crude bickering, and finally becoming so turned on by their arguing, that they begin to orgasm, leading to a variation of the classic Dalek catchphrase [...] "Exterminate", now [...] "Exsperminate". In the pilot episode, dubbed clips from the 1979 serial Destiny of the Daleks were used. A later attempt at reviving the Gay Daleks as an animated series was blocked by the Terry Nation Estate.|$|R
5000|$|Chinese nouns require {{classifiers}} (also termed measure words, in Chinese 量词量詞 liàngcí) {{in order}} to be counted. That is, when specifying the amount of a <b>countable</b> <b>noun,</b> a classifier must be inserted, and the classifier has to agree with the noun. Hence one must say 两头牛 兩頭牛 liǎng tóu niú [...] "two head of cattle" [...] for [...] "two cows", with tóu being the unit of measurement, or measure word. (This phenomenon is common in East Asian languages. In English, some words, as in the cited example of [...] "cattle", are often paired with a noun used much like the Chinese measure word. Bottle in [...] "two bottles of wine" [...] or piece in [...] "three pieces of paper" [...] are further examples.) However, certain nouns (representing units of measurement, time or currency) are themselves classifiers, and can therefore be counted directly.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{people say}} that [...] "none" [...] should always take a {{singular}} verb, even when talking about <b>countable</b> <b>nouns</b> (e.g. five friends). They argue that [...] "none" [...] means [...] "no one", and [...] "one" [...] is obviously singular. They say that [...] "I invited five friends but none has come" [...] is correct and [...] "I invited five friends but none have come" [...] is incorrect. Actual usage evidence does not support this view. [...] "None" [...] {{has been used for}} hundreds of years with both a singular and a plural verb, according to the context and the emphasis required.|$|E

5000|$|Suffixes often carry a {{specific}} gender. For example, in German, diminutives with the suffixes -chen and -lein (meaning [...] "little, young") are always neuter, {{even if they}} refer to people, as with Mädchen ("girl") and Fräulein ("young woman") (see below). Similarly, the suffix -ling, which makes <b>countable</b> <b>nouns</b> from uncountable nouns (Teig [...] "dough" [...] → Teigling [...] "piece of dough"), or personal nouns from abstract nouns (Lehre [...] "teaching", Strafe [...] "punishment" [...] → Lehrling [...] "apprentice", Sträfling [...] "convict") or adjectives (feige [...] "cowardly" [...] → Feigling [...] "coward"), always produces masculine nouns. And the German suffixes -heit and -keit (comparable with -hood and -ness in English) produce feminine nouns.|$|E

40|$|This book aims {{to enhance}} and {{challenge}} {{our understanding of}} language and literacy as social practice {{against the background of}} heightened globalisation. Juffermans presents an ethnographic study of the linguistic landscape of The Gambia, arguing that language should be conceptualised as a verb (languaging) rather than a <b>countable</b> <b>noun</b> (a language, languages). He goes on to argue that sociolinguistics should not be defined as the study of ‘who speaks what language to whom, and when and to what end’ (as Fishman defined it), but as the study of who uses which linguistic features under particular circumstances in a particular place and time. The book is therefore in part an exercise to unpluralise language, which Juffermans argues is necessary for a more realistic understanding of what language is, what it does, and what people do with it. The book will be of interest to sociolinguistics researchers, especially those focusing on Africa and the global South...|$|R
