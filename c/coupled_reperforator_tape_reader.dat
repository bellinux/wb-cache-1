50|$|The DX paper <b>tape</b> <b>readers</b> {{operate at}} any speed up to 360 {{characters}} per second via external timing, except EIA. EIA <b>tape</b> <b>readers</b> operate at 120 {{characters per second}} if internal timing is used, and up to 314 characters per second if external timing is used. All of the DX paper <b>tape</b> <b>readers</b> are adjustable-level, reading 5, 6, 7 or 8-level fully punched or chadless paper tape. The DX series of paper <b>tape</b> <b>readers</b> were available in table-top and rack mount models, with an optional verifier data output for use by an external verifier logic to guarantee the accuracy of each character read.|$|R
50|$|The Model 28 <b>Tape</b> <b>Readers,</b> {{also known}} as a transmitter-distributors, are transmitting-only five, six, seven or eight level devices that {{automatically}} converts chadless or fully perforated paper tape into electrical impulses. These devices are self-contained and motor-driven and operate at speeds up to 200 words-per-minute. In some equipment, these electrical signals are transmitted sequentially over a single telegraph channel to local or remote receiving stations. In other cases, the <b>tape</b> <b>readers</b> will provide output on a parallel-wire basis. The Model 28 family of <b>tape</b> <b>readers</b> includes the fixed head single contact transmitter-distributor (LXD), pivoted head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LAXD), fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LBXD), pivoted and fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LCXD) and <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> parallel-wire transmitter (LX).|$|R
50|$|Paper tape {{could be}} read into {{computers}} at up to 1000 characters per second.The Danish company Regnecentralen developed a paper <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> called RC 2000 that could read 2000 characters per second. It was introduced in 1963. Later they increased the speed further, up to 2500 cps. As early as World War II, the Heath Robinson <b>tape</b> <b>reader,</b> used by Allied codebreakers, was capable of 2000 cps while Colossus could run at 5000 cps using an optical <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> designed by Dr Arnold Lynch.|$|R

A less-common <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> had a four-position START/AUTO/STOP/FREE lever. In the AUTO position {{it could be}} commanded on and off remotely. The tape punch is the unit directly behind the reader. As it exits the machine, the tape passes under a triangular lip that allows the tape to be easily torn by lifting against the sharp edge of the lip.|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s, {{computer-aided}} manufacturing equipment often used paper tape. Paper tape {{was a very}} important storage medium for computer-controlled wire-wrap machines, for example. A paper <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> was smaller and much less expensive than hollerith card or magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>readers.</b> Premium black waxed and lubricated long-fiber papers, and Mylar film tape were invented so that production tapes for these machines would last longer.|$|R
50|$|Older {{controls}} frequently had no port {{capable of}} receiving {{programs such as}} an RS232 or RS422 connector. In these cases, a device known as a Behind The Reader or BTR card was used. The connection between the control's <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> and the internal processor {{was interrupted by a}} microprocessor based device which emulated the paper <b>tape</b> <b>reader's</b> signals, but which had a serial port connected to the DNC system. As far as the control was concerned, it was receiving from the paper tape unit as it always had; in fact it was the BTR or Reader Emulation card which was transmitting. A switch was frequently added to permit the paper <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> {{to be used as a}} backup.|$|R

Data could be read from the paper <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> or from the Teletype keyboard. Output was either printed to the Teletype or sent to the paper tape punch. Early versions had no facility for on-line storage of programs or data.|$|R

5000|$|When a Teletype 33 ASR {{equipped}} with the automatic paper <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> received a Control-S (XOFF, an abbreviation for transmit off), it caused the <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> to stop; receiving Control-Q (XON, [...] "transmit on") caused the <b>tape</b> <b>reader</b> to resume. This technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a [...] "handshaking" [...] signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique. On some systems Control-S retains its meaning but Control-Q {{is replaced by a}} second Control-S to resume output. The 33 ASR also could be configured to employ Control-R (DC2) and Control-T (DC4) to start and stop the tape punch; on some units {{equipped with}} this function, the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was TAPE and TAPE respectively.|$|R
