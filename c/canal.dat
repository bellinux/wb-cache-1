5|$|In north Somerset, mining in the Somerset {{coalfield}} was {{an important}} industry, and {{in an effort to}} reduce the cost of transporting the coal the Somerset Coal <b>Canal</b> was built; part of it was later converted into a railway. Other canals included the Bridgwater and Taunton <b>Canal,</b> Westport <b>Canal,</b> Grand Western <b>Canal,</b> Glastonbury <b>Canal</b> and Chard <b>Canal.</b> The Dorset and Somerset <b>Canal</b> was proposed, but very little of it was ever constructed.|$|E
5|$|The Newport Pagnell <b>Canal</b> {{had opened}} in 1817 between the Grand Junction <b>Canal</b> at Great Linford and Newport Pagnell. The <b>canal</b> carried a {{reasonable}} level of traffic, but in 1845, the LNWR attempted {{to buy the}} <b>canal,</b> using it for a potential railway line. The offer was refused for two decades, until 1862, when the LNWR was able to purchase the <b>canal</b> for £9000. The <b>canal</b> closed in 1864. Despite this, the railway when built did not run on {{the line of the}} old <b>canal.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{connection}} to the Rochdale <b>Canal</b> was eventually built in 1839 via the Manchester and Salford Junction <b>Canal,</b> which was {{funded in part by}} the proprietors of the MB <b>canal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Suvorov {{military}} <b>canals</b> (Suvorov <b>canals)</b> is {{a series}} of four open <b>canals</b> on Saimaa lake in Finland. The four <b>canals</b> of Kutvele, Käyhkää, Kukonharju and Telataipale are located in Puumala, Ruokolahti and Sulkava. They were built between 1791-1798 as part of the South-Eastern Finland fortification system and are the oldest <b>canals</b> in Finland. The <b>canals</b> are named after general Alexander Suvorov who ordered their construction.|$|R
25|$|Irrigation <b>canals</b> are {{classified}} into principal <b>canals</b> (Rayah), main <b>canals</b> (first level <b>canals),</b> branch <b>canals</b> (second level <b>canals),</b> distribution <b>canals</b> (Mesqas, or third level <b>canals)</b> and irrigation ditches (Merwas). Flow in {{the principal and}} main <b>canals</b> is continuous; in the branch and distribution <b>canals</b> it is on a rotation basis. However, the government supports a process of converting some of the lower-level <b>canals</b> gradually to continuous flow. Farmers pump water from the mesqas to irrigate fields (lift: about 0.5-1.5 m). A Mesqa typically serves an area of 50 to 200 feddan (20 to 80 hectares). In areas {{where there is no}} formal operational structure for proper water distribution, the tail-end users usually are not getting enough water to maintain crops. Water user associations have been formed beginning in the 1990s to better distribute water among farmers on a mesqa and to rationalize pumping, with the aim of reducing water abstraction, pumping costs and to increase yields.|$|R
50|$|<b>Canals</b> with a {{freezing}} {{system were}} built to replicate historic <b>canals.</b> The <b>canals</b> were constructed {{on the old}} Memorial Auditorium site and were completed in 2014. The <b>canals</b> have water {{in the spring and}} summer and ice in the winter for skating and ice biking.|$|R
5|$|A {{separate}} <b>canal,</b> the St. Johns-Indian River Barge <b>Canal,</b> {{was planned}} {{to link the}} river with the Intracoastal Waterway; the project never broke ground, and was canceled soon after the Cross Florida Barge <b>Canal</b> was suspended.|$|E
5|$|Access to the {{navigation}} was improved for traditional <b>canal</b> boats {{with the opening}} of the Runcorn and Weston <b>Canal,</b> which was completed in 1859. The <b>canal</b> left the Weston <b>Canal</b> at Weston Point, and provided a link to Runcorn Docks, near which two flights of locks connected to the Bridgewater <b>Canal.</b> This link was severed in 1966, when the Runcorn to Widnes road bridge was constructed. Half of the Runcorn and Weston <b>Canal</b> was filled in at the same time.|$|E
5|$|After the Ashton <b>Canal</b> {{closed in}} the 1960s, {{it was decided to}} turn the Portland Basin {{warehouse}} into a museum. In 1985, {{the first part of the}} Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the Ashton <b>Canal,</b> the Huddersfield Narrow <b>Canal</b> and the Peak Forest <b>Canal</b> meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for Coronation Street, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the <b>canal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In mature compact bone {{most of the}} {{individual}} lamellae form concentric rings around larger longitudinal <b>canals</b> (approx. 50 µm in diameter) within the bone tissue. These <b>canals</b> are called haversian <b>canals.</b> Haversian <b>canals</b> are contained within osteons, which are typically arranged along the long axis of the bone in parallel to the surface. The <b>canals</b> and the surrounding lamellae (8-15) form the functional unit, called a haversian system or osteon.|$|R
50|$|Volkmann's <b>canals,</b> {{also known}} as {{perforating}} holes or channels, are atomic arrangements in cortical bones. Volkmann's <b>canals</b> are inside osteons. They interconnect the haversian <b>canals</b> {{with each other and}} the periosteum. They usually run at obtuse angles to the haversian <b>canals</b> and contain anastomosing vessels between haversian capillaries. They were named after German physiologist Alfred Volkmann (1800-1878).Volkmann's <b>canals</b> are any of the small channels in the bone that transmit blood vessels from the periosteum into the bone and that communicate with the haversian canals.The perforating <b>canals</b> provide energy and nourishing elements for osteons.|$|R

5|$|Although the Chester <b>Canal</b> was not {{a success}} as traffic was sparse, this changed once it was {{connected}} to the Ellesmere <b>Canal.</b> The Ellesmere company expected to carry limestone from the quarries at Llanymynech and Trevor, iron from the ironworks at Ruabon and Bersham, and coal from mines at Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham to Chester, Liverpool and Shrewsbury. The <b>canal</b> to Bersham and Wrexham was not built, and that to Shrewsbury was built much later on, but trade in coal, limestone, lime and building materials developed within the network of canals, and traffic between the canals and Liverpool increased steadily, much of it passing along the former Chester <b>Canal.</b> Receipts for the Ellesmere <b>Canal</b> were £12,568 in 1807 and £15,707 just two years later.|$|E
5|$|An 1891 Ordnance Survey {{map shows}} that the arm on the Rochdale <b>Canal</b> had been filled in and the complex's <b>canal</b> basin had been retitled as a reservoir, {{suggesting}} that the <b>canal</b> had ceased {{to be used as}} a way of transporting goods to and from the complex. By 1902, the <b>canal</b> basin had been filled in, however exactly when it was filled in is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Around 1840, the <b>canal</b> commissioners of a <b>canal</b> on the West Branch Susquehanna River {{received}} {{instructions to}} extend the <b>canal</b> {{as far as the}} mouth of Tangascootack Creek.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>canals</b> {{attempted}} to keep changes in level {{down to a}} minimum. These <b>canals</b> known as contour <b>canals</b> would take longer, winding routes, along which the land was a uniform altitude. Other, generally later, <b>canals</b> took more direct routes requiring the use of various methods {{to deal with the}} change in level.|$|R

5|$|At Briton Ferry, the <b>canal</b> ends {{under the}} M4 {{motorway}} at a scrapyard, {{but there are}} plans to refurbish Brunel's Briton Ferry dock, just to the south, and a short extension to it would provide a good terminus. In Neath itself, a masterplan for the <b>Canal</b> Green area, developing both the river frontage and <b>canal</b> sides, {{has the potential to}} provide a <b>canal</b> basin and moorings for Neath.|$|E
5|$|Between 1793 and 1800 the Grand Junction <b>Canal</b> was built, {{connecting}} London to the Midlands. The <b>canal</b> {{followed the}} course of the River Bulbourne through the Chilterns, and included a branch to Aylesbury. For the first time the coal and industrial products of northern England and London could be cheaply supplied to Buckinghamshire, and grain and timber from Buckinghamshire's farms could easily be shipped to market. The route taken by the Grand Junction <b>Canal</b> ran through the east of the county, leaving the Chiltern towns of southern Buckinghamshire isolated. When Robert Stephenson's London and Birmingham Railway opened in 1838 it paralleled the route of the <b>canal</b> through Buckinghamshire. Although the short 1839 Aylesbury Railway linked Aylesbury to the London and Birmingham Railway, the rest of central Buckinghamshire remained unconnected to the railway and <b>canal</b> networks.|$|E
5|$|Boating on the <b>canal</b> is encouraged, {{although}} {{the lack of}} a link to the River Parrett at Bridgwater is restrictive. At this point, the Parrett is a salt water river, and is laden with silt, whereas the <b>canal</b> contains fresh water. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the <b>canal,</b> but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh, as the <b>canal</b> is still used for the transport of drinking water for the population of Bridgwater. The <b>canal</b> forms part of the local flood relief system, in winter taking water from the River Tone at Taunton and discharging it into the Parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of Bridgwater, near the Bridgwater Canalside Centre.|$|E
40|$|A mandibular second premolar {{with four}} <b>canals</b> is an {{interesting}} example of anatomic variations. This report describes {{a case of a}} mandibular second premolar with three roots and four <b>canals</b> (one mesiobuccal, two distobuccal and one lingual). The <b>canals</b> were prepared using K-files and irrigated with NaOCl (5. 25 %) and normal saline as the final irrigant. The <b>canals</b> were filled laterally with gutta percha and AH 26 sealer (De Trey, Dentsply, Switzerland).

40|$|Presented {{here is a}} {{case where}} 8 <b>canals</b> were located in a mandibular first molar. A patient with {{continuing}} pain in mandibular left first molar even after completion of biomechanical preparation was referred by a dentist. Following basic laws of the pulp chamber floor anatomy, 8 <b>canals</b> were located in three steps with 4 <b>canals</b> in each root. In both of the roots, 4 separate <b>canals</b> commenced which joined into two <b>canals</b> and exited as two separate foramina. At 6 mon follow-up visit, the tooth was found to be asymptomatic and revealed normal radiographic periapical area. The case stresses on the fact that understanding the laws of pulp chamber anatomy and complying with them while attempting to locate additional <b>canals</b> can prevent missing <b>canals...</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite {{commercial}} traffic ceasing in 1907, the infrastructure was maintained in good order, and the <b>canal</b> {{was used for}} the transport of potable water from 1962. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for Somerset County Council to start the restoration of the <b>canal</b> as a leisure facility, which was completed in 1994, when the <b>canal</b> was reopened throughout. Bridgwater Docks have been restored as a marina, but there is no navigable connection to the River Parrett, as the <b>canal</b> still transports drinking water for the people of Bridgwater.|$|E
5|$|During {{the life}} of the <b>canal,</b> there were several {{proposals}} to link the <b>canal</b> to the Basingstoke <b>Canal,</b> to provide an inland route between London and Southampton. The first was in 1788, and was initiated by the Basingstoke <b>Canal</b> company, six months after they started work on their main line. A survey for a proposed route was made, but no further progress occurred.|$|E
