5|$|Beads {{made from}} {{meteoric}} iron in 3500BC or earlier {{were found in}} Gerzah, Egypt by G. A. Wainwright. The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities. Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools. For example, a dagger made of meteoric iron {{was found in the}} tomb of Tutankhamun, containing similar proportions of iron, cobalt, and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower. Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500BC. Meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily forged by <b>cold</b> <b>working</b> but may get brittle when heated because of the nickel content.|$|E
25|$|Often {{intermediate}} anneals {{are required}} to counter the effects of <b>cold</b> <b>working,</b> and to allow more further drawing. A final anneal may also be used on the finished product to maximize ductility and electrical conductivity.|$|E
25|$|During the {{operation}} coolant is pumped between the rill plates because the high pressure between the plates and friction creates considerable heat. The high pressure {{applied to the}} balls also induces <b>cold</b> <b>working,</b> which strengthens the balls.|$|E
50|$|Ammonium sulfite can be {{included}} in lubricants for <b>cold</b> metal <b>working.</b> The lubricants are intended to reduce friction to keep heat production down and keep impurities out of the metals.|$|R

25|$|Examples {{of parts}} made by this process are: wheel hub unit bearings, {{transmission}} gears, {{tapered roller bearing}} races, stainless steel coupling flanges, and neck rings for LP gas cylinders. Manual transmission gears are an example of automatic hot forging {{used in conjunction with}} <b>cold</b> <b>working.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cold {{extrusion}} is done at {{room temperature}} or near room temperature. The advantages of this over hot extrusion are the lack of oxidation, higher strength due to <b>cold</b> <b>working,</b> closer tolerances, better surface finish, and fast extrusion speeds if the material is subject to hot shortness.|$|E
25|$|The area {{now known}} as West Virginia was a {{favorite}} hunting ground of numerous Native American peoples {{before the arrival of}} European settlers. Many ancient earthen mounds constructed by various mound builder cultures survive, especially in the areas of Moundsville, South Charleston, and Romney. The artifacts uncovered in these give evidence of a village society having a tribal trade system culture that practiced the <b>cold</b> <b>working</b> of copper to a limited extent. As of 2009, over 12,500 archaeological sites have been documented in West Virginia (Bryan Ward 2009:10).|$|E
50|$|Caribou is {{supposed}} to have derived its name from a drink consisting of a mixture of caribou blood and whisky which was consumed by hunters and loggers in colonial times to stave off the <b>cold</b> when <b>working.</b>|$|R

40|$|The present work {{is aimed}} at the {{description}} of experimental results on the drop fraction of high-power electrical vacuum discharge and analysis of processes, which take place in <b>cold</b> cathodes <b>working</b> in microsecond range of pulses, and also {{on the influence of}} the material of a cold cathode on the operating mode of the pulse high-current vacuum diode...|$|R
25|$|Tube {{drawing is}} a process to size a tube by {{shrinking}} a large diameter tube into a smaller one, by drawing the tube through a die. This process produces high-quality tubing with precise dimensions, good surface finish, and the added strength of <b>cold</b> <b>working.</b> For this reason this process is established for many materials, namely metalworking but also glass. Because it is so versatile, tube drawing is suitable for both large- and small-scale production. The large-scale production of glass typically uses a one step process where glass is directly drawn into a tube from a melting tank.|$|E
25|$|Laser peening {{typically}} uses {{high energy}} (10 to 40 Joule), 10 to 30 nanosecond pulse, flashed laser systems to generate gigawatts of {{power on the}} surface of a part by focusing the laser beam down to a few millimeters in diameter. Laser peening is unlike the other manufacturing processes in that it neither heats or adds material; it is a mechanical process of <b>cold</b> <b>working</b> the metallic component to impart compressive residual stresses. Laser peening is widely used in gas fired turbine engines in both aerospace and power generation for component damage tolerance improvement and fatigue life and strength increase.|$|E
25|$|Rotary swaging {{is usually}} a <b>cold</b> <b>working</b> process, used to reduce the diameter, produce a taper, or add a point to a round workpiece. It can also impart {{internal}} shapes in hollow workpieces {{through the use of}} a mandrel (the shape must have a constant cross-section). Swaging a bearing into a housing means either flaring its groove's lips onto the chamfer of the housing, or flaring the housing's material over the edge of the bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around the hole and are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way. Grease is often used to lubricate this swaging process, which is also called roller swaging.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} was the {{optimization}} of wire drawing process parameters. Design/methodology/approach: The hard binding material determined according to American standard ANSI/AWSA 5. 8 - 92 as High-temp 095 was chosen to the analysis of wire drawing process. It is hard solder with high fluidity properties. Findings: Wires, bars and strips are the most often use forms of this solder on the base of copper with low deformability properties, which shows crack sensitivity during <b>cold</b> plastic <b>working</b> processes so there was the necessity to determining optimal parameters of initial material use to the later <b>cold</b> plastic <b>working</b> processes. Research limitations/implications: To the numerical analysis of Hi-temp 095 wire drawing process the Drawing 2 d programme based of finite element method, has been use, for initial materials obtained on the casting and extrusion way. Practical implications: The optimal properties of basic material use for further plastic working processes were determined. Originality/value: The rheology of materials after casting and extrusion processes were determined...|$|R

25|$|Forging is a {{manufacturing}} process involving {{the shaping of}} metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of <b>cold</b> <b>working),</b> warm forging, or hot forging (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons. Forging {{has been done by}} smiths for millennia; the traditional products were kitchenware, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, and jewellery. Since the Industrial Revolution, forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever a component requires high strength; such forgings usually require further processing (such as machining) to achieve a finished part. Today, forging is a major worldwide industry.|$|E
500|$|Copper occurs {{naturally}} {{as native}} metallic copper and {{was known to}} some of the oldest civilizations on record. The history of copper use dates to 9000 BC in the Middle East; a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to 8700 BC. Evidence suggests that gold and meteoric iron (but not iron smelting) were the only metals used by humans before copper. The history of copper metallurgy is thought to follow this sequence: First, <b>cold</b> <b>working</b> of native copper, then annealing, smelting, and, finally, [...] lost-wax casting. In southeastern Anatolia, all four of these techniques appear more or less simultaneously {{at the beginning of the}} Neolithic c. 7500 BC.|$|E
500|$|When A-10 {{full rate}} {{production}} was first authorized the planned service life was 6,000 hours. A small reinforcement {{to the design}} was quickly adopted when the A-10 failed initial fatigue testing at 80% of testing; with the fix, the A-10 passed the fatigue tests. 8,000 flight hour service lives were becoming common at the time, so fatigue testing of the A-10 continued with a new 8,000 hour target. Fatigue testing for the new target quickly discovered serious cracks at Wing Station 23 (WS23) where the outboard portions of the wings are joined to the fuselage. The first production change was to add <b>cold</b> <b>working</b> at WS23 to address this problem. [...] Soon after that, the Air Force determined that the real world A-10 fleet fatigue was more harsh than estimated forcing them to change their fatigue testing, introducing [...] "spectrum 3" [...] equivalent flight hour testing.|$|E

50|$|Fedora was the codename for Aleksy Isidorovich Kulak (1923-1983), a KGB-agent who {{infiltrated}} the United Nations {{during the}} <b>Cold</b> War. While <b>working</b> in New York, Kulak contacted the FBI and offered his services. Kulak told his American handlers {{there was a}} KGB mole working at the FBI, leading to a decades-long mole hunt that seriously disrupted the agency. It's not clear whether Kulak was acting as a double agent supplying false information or whether his information was legitimate.|$|R
500|$|Spectrum 3 {{fatigue testing}} started in 1979. This round of testing quickly {{determined}} that more drastic reinforcement would be needed. [...] The second change in production, starting with aircraft #442, was {{to increase the}} thickness of the lower skin on the outer wing panels. [...] A tech order was issued to retrofit the [...] "thick skin" [...] to the whole fleet, but the tech order was rescinded after roughly 242 planes, leaving about 200 planes with the original [...] "thin skin". [...] Starting with aircraft #530, <b>cold</b> <b>working</b> at WS0 was performed, and this retrofit was performed on earlier aircraft. [...] A fourth, even more drastic change was initiated with aircraft #582, again to address the problems discovered with spectrum 3 testing. [...] This change increased the thickness on the lower skin on the center wing panel but it required modifications to the lower spar caps to accommodate the thicker skin. [...] The Air Force determined that it was not economically feasible to retrofit earlier planes with this modification.|$|E

40|$|Remote {{delivery}} tubes (RDTs) in Collins {{and similar}} types of helium liquefiers interconnect the liquefier with the storage dewar. In these liquefiers the Joule-Thompson (J-T) valve is separately {{situated in the}} liquefier cryostat. Therefore there is a regime of J-T heating during the initial cool down of the liquefier, since {{there is a time}} lag in reaching the inversion temperature for the J-T valve. The note describes the design, fabrication, and testing of a RDT with an integral J-T valve. A demountable copper <b>cold</b> seal <b>working</b> at a pressure of 15 bar was successfully tested. The J-T valve seat made of Cu-Cr-Zr alloy provided excellent sealing with the stainless-steel valve tip at liquid-helium temperatures. The testing of this RDT with integral J-T showed substantial reduction in cool down time for the liquefier as well as better control of the dewar pressures. ...|$|R

2500|$|Wire {{drawing is}} a {{metalworking}} process {{used to reduce}} the cross-section of a wire by pulling the wire through a single, or series of, drawing die(s). [...] There are many applications for wire drawing, including electrical wiring, cables, tension-loaded structural components, springs, paper clips, spokes for wheels, and stringed musical instruments. [...] Although similar in process, drawing is different from extrusion, because in drawing the wire is pulled, rather than pushed, through the die. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified as a <b>cold</b> <b>working</b> process, {{but it may be}} performed at elevated temperatures for large wires to reduce forces.|$|E
2500|$|Drawing is a {{metalworking}} {{process which}} uses tensile forces to stretch metal or glass. As the metal is drawn (pulled), it stretches thinner, into a desired shape and thickness. Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and wire, bar, and tube drawing. The specific definition for sheet metal drawing {{is that it}} involves plastic deformation over a curved axis. For wire, bar, and tube drawing the starting stock is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. Drawing is usually done at room temperature, thus classified a <b>cold</b> <b>working</b> process, however it may be performed at elevated temperatures to hot work large wires, rods or hollow sections {{in order to reduce}} forces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wire drawing}} process is quite simple in concept. The wire is {{prepared}} by shrinking {{the beginning of}} it, by hammering, filing, rolling or swaging, {{so that it will}} fit through the die; the wire is then pulled through the die. As the wire is pulled through the die, its volume remains the same, so as the diameter decreases, the length increases. Usually the wire will require more than one draw, through successively smaller dies, to reach the desired size. The American wire gauge scale is based on this. This can be done on a small scale with a draw plate, or on a large commercial scale using automated machinery. [...] The process of wire drawing changes material properties due to <b>cold</b> <b>working.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this paper, RBD palm stearin, {{which is}} one of the refined {{products}} of palm oil, was tested as <b>cold</b> metal <b>working</b> lubricant by plane strain extrusion. Whole experiments were carried out at room temperature 20 Â°C. Pure aluminum A 1050 was used as a workpiece. In these experiments, the extrusion loads were measured and the surface conditions of workpieces were observed. The distribution of relative velocity was calculated in the deformation zone of workpiece by applying the visioplasticity method. Similar experimental and analytical investigations were carried out for a conventional lubricant, paraffinic mineral oil, and the results were compared to those of the RBD palm stearin. Present investigation confirms that lubrication effect of RBD palm stearin reducing the frictional constraint in the cold metal forming is similar to that of mineral base lubricating oil. However, the existence of RBD palm stearin in solid state at around room temperature affects the surface condition of workpiece, and coarser roughness condition is observed in cold extrusion...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Rendering of an Ericsson engine. A <b>cold</b> gaseous <b>working</b> fluid, such as {{atmospheric}} air (shown in blue), enters the cylinder via a non-return valve at the top-right. The air is compressed by the piston (black) as the piston moves upward. The compressed air {{is stored in}} the pneumatic tank (at left). A two-way valve (gray) moves downward to allow pressurized air {{to pass through the}} regenerator where it is preheated. The air then enters the space below the piston, which is an externally heated expansion-chamber. The air expands and does work on the piston as it moves upward. After the expansion stroke, the two-way valve moves upward, thus closing off the tank and opening the exhaust port. As the piston moves back downward in the exhaust stroke, hot air is pushed back through the regenerator, which reclaims most of the heat, before passing out the exhaust port (left) as cool air.|$|R
