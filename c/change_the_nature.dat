Later that year, President Jimmy Carter (for whom Rodham had been the 1976 campaign director of field operations in Indiana) appointed her {{to the board of}} directors of the Legal Services Corporation, and she served in that capacity from 1978 until the end of 1981. From mid-1978 to mid-1980, she was the chair of that board, the first woman to have the job. During her time as chair, funding for the Corporation was expanded from $90 million to $300 million; subsequently, she successfully fought President Ronald Reagan's attempts to reduce the funding and <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the organization.|$|E

Some types of soluble fibers bind to bile acids in the small intestine, making them less likely to re-enter the body; this in turn lowers cholesterol levels in the blood from the actions of cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Urban Land Institute {{recommended}} redeveloping L'Enfant Promenade {{to create}} a more tourist-friendly environment as well as creating a link with the southwest waterfront. Although this concept garnered little attention at the time, it proved to be the genesis of a major plan that emerged around 2010 to radically <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> and look of L'Enfant Plaza. A year later, Sarakreek Holdings replaced the Pei-designed fountain with a glass pyramid skylight over the center section of La Promenade.|$|E

Transhumanists who foresee this massive technological change generally maintain that it is desirable. However, some are also concerned with the possible dangers of extremely rapid technological change and propose options for ensuring that advanced technology is used responsibly.

His thesis involved the nature of political parties. Studying {{at the same time as}} Cañas were other national political luminaries, such as Rodrigo Facio, Carlos Monge, Gonzalo Facio, Jorge Rossi Chavarría, Daniel Oduber, and Hernán González.

25|$|The {{theory of}} LQG is one {{possible}} {{solution to the}} problem of quantum gravity, as is string theory. There are substantial differences however. For example, string theory also addresses unification, the understanding of all known forces and particles as manifestations of a single entity, by postulating extra dimensions and so-far unobserved additional particles and symmetries. Contrary to this, LQG is based only on quantum theory and general relativity and its scope is limited to understanding the quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction. On the other hand, the consequences of LQG are radical, because they fundamentally <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of space and time and provide a tentative but detailed physical and mathematical picture of quantum spacetime.|$|E
25|$|These {{conflicts}} put {{an enormous}} {{strain on the}} resources of the Republic, however, and for that reason the Republic (like its opponent, the France of Louis XIV) was deeply in debt {{at the end of the}} War of the Spanish Succession. The regents of the Republic more or less abandoned its Great-Power pretensions after 1713, cutting down on its military preparedness in a vain attempt to pay down this overhang of public debt. That debt brought a significant rentier class into being that helped <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of the economy from one invested primarily in trade and industry into one in which a significant financial sector played a dominant role. By the end of the 18th century the Republic was the major market for sovereign debt, and a major source of foreign direct investment.|$|E

25|$|Various {{proposals}} to redevelop or eliminate Banneker Park {{in the late}} 1990s and throughout the 2000s also threatened to radically <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of L'Enfant Plaza. By the early 1990s, the park had suffered from lack of maintenance, deterioration {{of some of its}} features, and the fountain had stopped running. In 1996, the nonprofit Washington Interdependence Council won permission from the NPS, which managed the park at the time, to raise $3 million in funds to build a life-size statue of Banneker for the park and to make other improvements (such as bas relief sculptures depicting Banneker's achievements on the limestone circle surrounding the overlook). In 1997, the NPS partially restored the park (including restoring signage, getting the fountain running again, and adding a small interpretive exhibit), and D.C. and federal officials sponsored a rededication ceremony there.|$|E
25|$|Atlantic-style warfare {{based on}} heavily armed sailing ships began to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of naval warfare in the Mediterranean in the 17th century. In 1616, a small Spanish {{squadron}} of five galleons and a patache {{was used to}} cruise the eastern Mediterranean and defeated a fleet of 55 galleys {{at the battle of}} Cape Celidonia. By 1650, war galleys were used primarily in the wars between Venice and the Ottoman Empire in their struggle for strategic island and coastal trading bases and until the 1720s by both France and Spain but for largely amphibious and cruising operations or in combination with heavy sailing ships in a major battle, where they played specialized roles. An example of this was when a Spanish fleet used its galleys in a mixed naval/amphibious battle in the second 1641 battle of Tarragona, to break a French naval blockade and land troops and supplies. Even a purely Mediterranean power like Venice began to construct sail only warships {{in the latter part of}} the century. Christian and Muslim corsairs had been using galleys in sea roving and in support of the major powers in times of war, but largely replaced them with xebecs, various sail/oar hybrids, and a few remaining light galleys in the early 17th century.|$|E

500|$|Waugh's {{conversion}} to Catholicism did not noticeably <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of his next two novels, Black Mischief (1934) and A Handful of Dust (1934), but, {{in the latter}} novel, the elements of farce are subdued, and the protagonist, Tony Last, is recognisably a person rather than a comic cipher. Waugh's first fiction with a Catholic theme was the short story [...] "Out of Depth" [...] (1933) about the immutability of the Mass. From the mid-1930s onwards, Catholicism and conservative politics were much featured in his journalistic and non-fiction writing before he reverted to his former manner with Scoop (1938), a novel about journalism, journalists, and unsavoury journalistic practices.|$|E

Ravel is pleased with The Nameless One's answer because he offers his own thoughts; she claims she has killed many men in the past who, instead of giving their own answers, tried to guess what her answer might be. As the conversation progresses, Ravel explains that, in a past life, The Nameless One {{had asked her to}} make him immortal; however, the ritual she performed was flawed, causing him to lose his memory each time he died. She reveals that the mortality she separated from him was not destroyed, and that {{as long as he was}} alive, his mortality must still be intact. She does not know where his mortality is, but suggests that the fallen deva Trias might.|$|E
500|$|But his {{philological}} concerns {{now were}} {{only a small part}} of a much larger project to make sense of the nature of the Greek culture itself. His work in this period shows a theoretical sophistication far beyond his earlier efforts, extending his theory of literacy toward a theory of culture itself. He said of the Dipylon inscription, a poetic line scratched into a vase and the earliest Greek writing known at the time, [...] "Here in this casual act by an unknown hand there is announced a revolution which was destined to <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> of human culture." [...] It is this larger point about the differences between oral and literate culture that represents Havelock's most influential contribution. Walter J. Ong, for example, in assessing the significance of non-oral communication in an oral culture, cites Havelock's observation that scientific categories, which are necessary not only for the natural sciences but also for historical and philosophical analysis, depend on writing. These ideas were sketched out in Preface to Plato but became central to Havelock's work from Prologue to Greek Literacy (1971) onward.|$|E
