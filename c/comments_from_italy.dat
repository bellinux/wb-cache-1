Lichen species diversity declines about 15 % <b>from</b> <b>Italy</b> to Norway but 50 % <b>from</b> <b>Italy</b> to Greenland, a much lower percentage than for vascular plants (92 %!). The S&oslash;rensen coefficient and an NMDS-ordination display geographic groups well: Italy, Austria and Germany, Finland, Sweden and Norway and finally Greenland. Denmark as the only country without mountains lacks saxicolous species and differs from the other countries. About half of the lichen species grow on rock, followed by bark, except for Greenland, there soil. Diversity and composition of lichen floras on bark and wood are rather homogeneous <b>from</b> <b>Italy</b> to Scandinavia, on soil even <b>from</b> <b>Italy</b> to Greenland. Diversity is higher on acidic than calcareous rock and soil, a contrast to observations from vascular plants. The diversity loss in &ldquo;southern&rdquo; calciphytic species in the northern countries is compensated by additional &ldquo;nordic&rdquo; species on acidic substrate. From Greenland even more acidophytic terricolous lichen species are known than <b>from</b> <b>Italy.</b> The reasons for the pH dependent diversity patterns are, same as for vascular plants, not known...|$|R
