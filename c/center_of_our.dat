By 1987, the year in which he organized the Harmonic Convergence event, Arguelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology. He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a [...] "galactic synchronization beam" [...] that emanated from the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> galaxy, that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 tuns (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in [...] "total synchronization" [...] and [...] "galactic entrainment" [...] of individuals [...] "plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery" [...] by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon. Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas.|$|E
