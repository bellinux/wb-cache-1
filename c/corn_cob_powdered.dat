We investigated the feasibility of <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> <b>powder</b> as a substrate for production of pigments by Monascus purpureus KACC 42430 in solid-state fermentation.

The use of rice straw negatively correlated with yield; however, it can still be increased {{by the addition of}} a certain proportion (50 %) of <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> to rice straw, such as used in formula  11. For instance, formula  11 (110.00 [*]±[*] 11.41  g) showed a yield increase of 246.45 % compared with formula  4 (31.75 [*]±[*] 3.61  g), which had rice straw alone, and showed a yield increase of 13.72 % compared with the control group (Table  2). Therefore, in places where the rice resources are rich, adding an appropriate proportion of <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> to replace sawdust can achieve the same effect in G. frondosa cultivation. Soybean straw and corn straw in a reasonable mixture ratio, or combined with substrates such as <b>corn</b> <b>cob,</b> can also replace sawdust to achieve the same effect in cultivation. When the yield is considered the priority indicator in the production of G. frondosa, using <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> <b>powder</b> as the main cultivation substrate substitute for sawdust will not only increase the yield but also increase the single-fruiting-body area.|$|R

By replacing traditional cooking fuels with charcoal, one can significantly reduce a user's exposure to the particulate matter responsible for the detrimental health effects. The MIT D-Lab has have developed a method of creating charcoal using agriculture wastes such as bagasse and corncobs. However, it has been found that corncob charcoal produces dangerously high levels of carbon monoxide and as a result is unable to be burned directly and must be briquetted. In conjunction with this, an organization in Lima, Peru called Enlace Solidario makes coal briquettes in a configuration that optimizes the burning performance. They have entered in a partnership with the nearby orphanage of Segrada Familia to produce cooking fuel at no cost. However, Segrada Familia must supply their own ground charcoal to be briquetted. Thus, there is a clear need for a charcoal grinding machine. This thesis developed a successful grinding mechanism based on a peanut sheller design developed by the Full Belly Project. Though it needs to be scaled up to achieve the required throughput, this mechanism successfully limits the user's exposure to charcoal dust created during the grinding process and provides a means to produce <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> <b>powder</b> necessary to briquette charcoal. by Ashely Elizabeth Thomas.

Nevertheless, there are many management issues {{that need to be}} addressed in order to efficiently store and remove <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> from the field with minimum damage to subsequent crops and soil health. The current practices include the storage of loose <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> mixed with <b>corn</b> residue as piles and bales at the edge of harvested fields over winter for later use in ethanol production.

Some bacteria {{have been reported to}} produce xylanases using defferent kinds of agricultural wastes as a substrate. The objective of this experiment was to optimize the concentration of <b>corn</b> <b>cobs</b> as a carbon source and liquid tofu waste as nitrogen source on xylanase production by Bacillus subtilis AQ- 1. A 22  central composite experimental design was performed to optimize the <b>corn</b> <b>cobs</b> and liquid tofu waste concentration. A second order quadratic model and a response surface method showed that the optimum condition for xylanase production was 1. 1 % (w/v) <b>corn</b> <b>cobs</b> and 0. 00198 % (v/v) total N of liquid tofu waste with the highest xylanase production of 122. 99 U/ml. Key words: bacillus subtilis AQ- 1, xylanase, <b>corn</b> <b>cob,</b> liquid tofu wast...|$|R
40|$|Carboxymethylcellulases (CMCases) of Arachniotus citrinus were {{produced}} under solid state fermentation on different carbon sources including wheat bran, <b>corn</b> <b>cob,</b> alkali treated <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> and mixture of wheat bran and alkali treated <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> at 30 o C for 15 days. In this case, mixture of wheat bran and <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> was observed {{to be the}} best carbon source as maximum specific activity (4. 2 U mg- 1 proteins) for crude CMCases was obtained on it. CMCases were partially purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation. The onset of CMCases precipitation occurred at 35 % and completed at 75 % saturation of ammonium sulphate at 0 o C. The purification after ammonium sulphate precipitation was 1. 72 -fold while 86 % CMCases were recovered. After dialysis, specific activity of CMCases was 7. 29 U mg- 1. CMCases were found resistant against chymotrypsin and subtilisin as residual activity of CMCases against these proteases was 85 and 70 % after 70 min, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the livestock unit of the University for Development Studies (UDS) to determine the effect of <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> {{on the performance of}} grasscutters (Thryonomys swinderianus). A total twelve weaned grasscutters of about 6 to 8 weeks old were assigned to two treatments, T 0 containing 0 % <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> (control) and T 1  containing 15 % <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> (CC). The experiment lasted for 8 weeks during the dry season. Data on feed intake and weight gain were collected over the period. Feed and feacal samples were collected from each treatment and their proximate composition analysed at the Spanish Laboratory of the UDS. There was no significant difference (P> 0. 05)  between the two diets for crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), Feed intake and final weight gain of the animals on the corn-cob based diets were similar to those on the non-corn cob base diet. It is concluded that <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> could be included up to 15 % in grasscutter diet without any detrimental effect on digestibility...|$|R
