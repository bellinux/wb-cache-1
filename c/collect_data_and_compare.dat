Technology options may include a number of pollution control alternatives: retrofits with more efficient equipment, fuel switching and/or process change to electrotechnologies, or advanced gas-fueled technologies. In some cases, a plant {{may be able to}} purchase emissions reduction credits (ERCs) in lieu of changing equipment, as would be the case in Southern California if the proposed RECLAIM regulations are adopted. In such cases, ERCs could also be sold by plants that achieve emissions reductions, offsetting the costs of their technology investments.

40|$|Background: Patients {{undergoing}} {{surgery for}} low rectal cancer often recieve a simultaneous {{construction of a}} temporary ileostomy, {{and most of them}} keep their stoma for at least 8 - 12 weeks. Late reversal of a temporary ileostomy is associated to low mortality, but up to 20 - 33 % of morbidity. Some of the most common complications are small bowel obstruction (0 - 15 %), wound infections (0 - 18, 3 %), anastomotic leaks (0 - 8 %) and stoma site hernias (5 %). A few prospective studies have investigated the morbidity and mortality of an early closure of the ileostomy, which is considered to be 2 weeks after the first surgery. Even though it {{did not seem to be}} associated with higher rates of neither of them, it is still unknown when the best moment for the closure is. Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the complications related to the closure of ileostomy, both in the stoma site and the rectum.

Technology options may include a number of pollution control alternatives-retrofits with more efficient equipment, fuel-switching and/or process change to electrotechnologies, or advanced gas-fueled technologies. In some cases, a plant may be able to purchase emission allowances in lieu of changing equipment or adding controls, as would be the case in Southern California with the existing RECLAIM regulations. In such cases, emission allowances could also be sold by plants that achieve emission reductions, offsetting the costs of their technology investments. This paper explores an exhaustive list of compliance options for the manufacturing sector (SICs 20 - 39).

The title abstract usually gives the order of seniority for the deeds related to the tract being surveyed and should be used if available. After this <b>data</b> is gathered <b>and</b> analyzed the field survey may commence. The initial survey operations should be concentrated on locating monuments. In urban regions, monuments should be sought initially; but {{in the absence of}} monuments, property corners marked by iron pins, metal survey markers, iron pipes, and other features possibly establishing a line of possession should be located. When the approximate positions for the boundaries of the property have been located, a traverse is run around the property. While the control traverse is being run, ties should be measured and all details relevant to the boundaries should be acquired. This includes but is not limited to locating the property corners, monuments, fences, hedge rows, walls, walks, and all buildings on the lot. The surveyor then takes this <b>collected</b> <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>compares</b> it to the records which were received.

40|$|The Mediterranean basin has an {{impressive}} amount of millenarian urban structures {{which have been}} modelled along centuries. Unfortunately, they are sometimes damaged due to both {{the passage of time}} as well as bad preservation criteria. In order to avoid these situations or reduce their effects, new preservation criteria have arisen in the last decades. These criteria aim to revitalize the historical value of these architectural remains from a cultural and economic perspective. In this line of research, the “Archaeology of Architecture” applies the theoretical principles of the archaeology to study buildings and streets, offering new methodologies of analysis. An important part of these methodologies incorporates new technologies, such as 3 D scanners, robotic total stations, or virtual and augmented reality, to the <b>data</b> acquisition <b>and</b> processing tasks. The application of these technologies in the area of Historical Heritage results in a breakthrough in the graphic documentation of monuments and archaeological remains, which allows the development of new preservation strategies. Among all these new technologies, this abstract proposes the use of an autonomous robot to help identifying elements inside a building. The robot navigates through the environment, <b>collects</b> <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>compares</b> them against well-known historical and architectural archetypes, to find a set of candidates for each perceived pattern. The advantages of the proposed system when compared against current state-of-the-art techniques are the following: (i) the robot explores the environment autonomously using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) algorithms and acquires colour and depth information; (ii) no special markers, such as the targets or spheres usually employed by robotic total stations, are required; (iii) the system uses advanced image processing methods to automatically provide a first characterization of perceived borders, that will help in different identification processes, from single elements to more complex structures; (iv) obtained data are <b>compared</b> against historical <b>and</b> architectural archetypes included in a data base; (v) evaluation of the object position inside the stratigraphic sequence of the wall.

Because of this, {{exploring}} new techniques of early heart disease detection and more advanced treatment options continues to be of paramount importance. Today, detection and diagnosis of heart disease can be done through both invasive and non-invasive measures, including lipid panels, catheterizations, and advanced imaging techniques amongst more traditional methods such as patient demographics and overall weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. The problem we now face is that traditional methods of detection can only go so far, with 40 - 50 % of heart attack victims exhibiting no signs of disease, {{and most of these}} people not willing to undergo a painful or expensive procedure without the signs of disease being present. With that being said, new imaging techniques could provide an avenue for doctors to diagnose heart related diseases, as imaging of the heart is relatively quick, non-invasive, and could possibly have costs covered by medical insurances.

40|$|Backround: The {{final year}} {{engineering}} project is {{widely seen as}} the capstone experience in engineering programs. For four year engineering programs aspiring to AQF 8 accreditation, {{it is essential that}} the final year projects provide students the opportunity to demonstrate many of the descriptors for Bachelor Honours degrees. However there is wide variation in both the type of project that students undertake and the level and style of support that they receive from their academic supervisors. This paper presents one set of guidelines to emerge from a national project focused on the assessment and supervision of final year projects. The guidelines are focused on best supervision practice. Purpose: This paper provides academic staff good practice guidelines on how to provide appropriate support to students through the final year project experience. Support provided should give the student an opportunity to demonstrate their ability to ‘provide solutions to complex problems with intellectual independence’ and to ‘design and use research in a project’ while maximising the chance of student success. The intention of the guidelines is to enhance academic project advisor capacity to ensure students meet the requirements of AQF 8 outcomes. Design/Method: The wider project methodology was largely qualitative, adopting a case study approach. Data was gathered from 16 universities across Australia (from all states and territories) and included university documentation such as subject outlines, rubrics and student guidelines. Additionally, interviews were conducted with 16 coordinators of final year project courses. Within these interviews, participants were asked specifically about supervision practices <b>and</b> challenges. Additional <b>data</b> was gathered from participants during a conference workshop designed to explore understandings of AQF 8. The guidelines presented in this paper were developed by analysing these <b>collected</b> <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>comparing</b> good practice outcomes with the AQF 8 descriptors. Literature regarding the design process, project based-learning facilitation and the systems engineering approach also informed the framework. Results: This paper reports on one outcome from an Office for Learning and Teaching (OLT) sponsored projecton final year engineering projects. The framework and subsequent guidelines describe the process that the student will navigate and the behaviours that the student and the advisor should exhibit at each stage of the process in order to give the student an optimal chance to successfully complete their project while still demonstrating the level of independence characteristic of the AQF 8 graduate. Conclusions: Final year engineering projects are a pivotal part of all engineering degrees. There is wide variation in the types of projects and levels of support that academic advisors provide to students throughout this process. The guidelines presented in this paper will assist academic advisors and final year project coordinators to provide quality support to students to meet AQF 8 outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the cost savings {{attributable to the}} implementation of a continuous monitoring system in a medical-surgical unit, and to determine the return on investment (ROI) associated with its implementation. Design: ROI analysis. Setting: A 316 -bed community hospital. Patients: Medicine, surgery or trauma patients admitted or transferred to a 33 -bed medical-surgical unit. Intervention: Each bed was equipped with a monitoring unit, with <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> <b>and</b> <b>compared</b> in a nine-month pre-implementation period to a nine-month post-implementation period. Measurements and main results: Two models were constructed: a base case model (A) in which we estimated the total cost savings of intervention effects, and a conservative model (B) in which we only included the direct variable cost component for the final day of length of stay and treatment of pressure ulcers. In the 5 -year ROI model, the monitoring system saved between 3, 268, 000 (Conservative Model B) and 9, 089, 000 (Base Model A), given an 80...|$|R
