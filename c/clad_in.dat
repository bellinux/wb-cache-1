5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Traktor, and was developed as an independent video from the film but contained Bond influences. It depicts Madonna as a prisoner in a torture chamber, alternating with scenes of a fencing duel between good (<b>clad</b> <b>in</b> white) and evil (<b>clad</b> <b>in</b> black) personas of the singer. Wounds inflicted on both fencers are mirrored on the imprisoned Madonna, {{and in the end}} she escapes being electrocuted in the chamber. The usage of Jewish religious texts and objects in the music video led to controversy, with scholars of Judaism deeming it sacrilegious. Madonna has included the song on two of her world tours; the first being the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour and again as a video interlude on the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour.|$|E
5|$|A brick privy with a {{gabled roof}} <b>clad</b> <b>in</b> {{corrugated}} asbestos sheeting is located {{to the north}} of the cottage building. It was probably constructed circa 1930. Further north is the workshop building, which also housed the electricity generators at one point, dating from the 1950s. It features a flat and skillion roof, and concrete mounting blocks. Its most recent use was as a fishermen's cabin.|$|E
5|$|During the Song period Buddhism {{saw a small}} revival {{since its}} {{persecution}} during the Tang dynasty. This {{could be seen in}} the continued construction of sculpture artwork at the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan province. Similar in design to the sculptures at Dazu, the Song temple at Mingshan in Anyue, Sichuan province features a wealth of Song era Buddhist sculptures, including the Buddha and deities <b>clad</b> <b>in</b> lavish imperial and monastic robes.|$|E

40|$|The {{task was}} to compute the maximum aluminum-oxide and oxide-coolant {{temperatures}} of assemblies <b>cladded</b> <b>in</b> 99 + percent aluminum. The assemblies considered were the Mark VB, VE, V 5, 15 and 25. These assemblies consist of nested slug columns with individual uranium slugs <b>cladded</b> <b>in</b> aluminum cans. The CREDIT code was modified to calculate the oxide film thickness and the aluminum-oxide temperature at each axial increment. This information in this report {{will be used to}} evaluate the potential for cladding corrosion of the Mark 25 assembly...|$|R
5|$|In Traverse City, Michigan, Mary Lefante {{goes to a}} local {{pharmacy}} to get her passport photo taken. Realizing she {{has forgotten}} her wallet, she returns to her car and finds that her boyfriend has been murdered. The killer, <b>clad</b> <b>in</b> a hooded raincoat, renders Lefante unconscious with a hypodermic needle, then kidnaps her. Meanwhile, in the pharmacy, the elderly clerk peels open Lefante's developed photo, which shows her screaming amidst a distorted background.|$|E
5|$|It {{became a}} game, with Feiffer {{trying to draw}} things the way he wanted, and Juster trying to {{describe}} things that were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromise—one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third exactly like the first two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, <b>clad</b> <b>in</b> a toga.|$|E
5|$|Madeline Smith, {{who played}} Miss Caruso, sharing Bond's {{bed in the}} film's opening, was {{recommended}} for the part by Roger Moore after he had appeared with her on TV.

5000|$|<b>Cladding</b> <b>in</b> {{optical fibers}} is {{one or more}} layers of {{materials}} of lower refractive index, in intimate contact with a core material of higher refractive index. The cladding causes light to be confined {{to the core of}} the fiber by total internal reflection at the boundary between the two. Light propagation <b>in</b> the <b>cladding</b> is suppressed <b>in</b> typical fiber. Improving transmission through fibers could by applying a <b>cladding</b> was discovered <b>in</b> 1953 by Dutch scientist Bram van Heel. Some fibers can support <b>cladding</b> modes <b>in</b> which light propagates <b>in</b> the <b>cladding</b> as well as the core.|$|R

5|$|The Cambrian Mountains {{run from}} {{northeast}} to southwest and occupy {{most of the}} central part of the country. These are more rounded and undulating, <b>clad</b> <b>in</b> moorland and rough, tussocky grassland. In the south of the country are the Brecon Beacons in central Powys, the Black Mountains (Y Mynyddoedd Duon) spread across parts of Powys and Monmouthshire in southeast Wales and, confusingly, Black Mountain (Y Mynydd Du), which lies further west on the border between Carmarthenshire and Powys.|$|E
5|$|The Centre's main feature, {{the bronze}} {{coloured}} dome which covers the Donald Gordon Theatre, is <b>clad</b> <b>in</b> steel that {{was treated with}} copper oxide. It was designed to withstand the weather conditions on the Cardiff Bay waterfront and will look increasingly better with age. The architect, Jonathan Adams, decided not to use copper and aluminium as they would both change colour with age and weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Old Vicarage, {{previously}} {{the east}} {{wing of the}} vicarage, was originally a timber-framed building built about 1600. It was <b>clad</b> <b>in</b> brick in the 18th century (after the vicarage had been extended west in 1722) and a third storey added early in the 19th century. The 1722 west-wing extension became 8 The Square and is listed separately.|$|E
50|$|In {{high-rise}} {{commercial and}} multi-family residential construction, CFSF is typically used for interior partitions {{and support of}} exterior walls and <b>cladding.</b> <b>In</b> many mid-rise and low-rise applications, the entire structural system can be framed with CFSF.|$|R
5000|$|EM2 {{utilizes}} passively {{safety systems}} designed to safely shutdown using only gravity and natural convection in emergency conditions. [...] Control rods and drums are automatically inserted during {{a loss of}} power incident via gravity. Natural convection flow is used to cool the core during whole site loss of power incidents. No external water supply is necessary for emergency cooling. The use of silicon carbide as a safety-enhanced fuel <b>cladding</b> <b>in</b> the core ensures no hydrogen production during accident scenarios and allows {{an extended period of}} response when compared to the use of Zircaloy metal <b>cladding</b> <b>in</b> current reactors, which are reactive and not as heat resistant as the ceramics in EM2.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} from the 16th or 17th century, with later additions. The ground floor is in brick while the upper floor is of timber framed {{construction}} with tile <b>cladding.</b> <b>In</b> 1987 the house was designated as Grade II* listed.|$|R
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the building is <b>clad</b> <b>in</b> multi-coloured slate collected from Welsh slate quarries. Narrow windows are built into the layers of slate {{to give the impression}} of rock; strata they depict the different stone layers in sea cliffs. The purple slate came from the Penrhyn Quarry, the blue from Cwt y Bugail Quarry, the green from the Nantlle Valley, the grey from Llechwedd quarry, and the black from the Corris Quarry.|$|E
5|$|The library {{block is}} {{predominantly}} <b>clad</b> <b>in</b> glass, fitted with horizontal fins, on its frontage {{with the main}} road. The alfresco café had a street frontage and was spread into the shared forecourt. The roof of the community building resembles the leaves of a palm tree, and covers the community club's rooftop basketball court. The court's location on the roof level was {{a departure from the}} norm, as in other community centres then, the basketball court occupies space on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|The skin of {{crocodilians}} {{is thick}} and cornified, and is <b>clad</b> <b>in</b> non-overlapping scales known as scutes, arranged in regular rows and patterns. These scales are continually being produced by cell {{division in the}} underlying layer of the epidermis, the stratum germinativum, and the surface of individual scutes sloughs off periodically. The outer surface of the scutes consists of the relatively rigid beta-keratin while the hinge region between the scutes contains only the more pliable alpha-keratin.|$|E
40|$|This {{effort is}} {{designed}} to be a preliminary study to determine the appropriateness of lightly contacting SNF with zirconium-based <b>cladding,</b> <b>in</b> wet storage, for the purpose of taking safeguards measurements. Contact will likely consist of an initial impact followed by a light tensile load on the exterior surface of the SNF <b>cladding.</b> <b>In</b> the past, concerns have been raised that contacting SNF <b>cladding</b> could result <b>in</b> a loss of long-term mechanical integrity due to crack initiation, uncontrolled crack propagation, and a mechanical exfoliation of the protective oxide layer. The mechanical integrity concerns are addressed with an analytic model that evaluates the threshold impact limits for degraded, but undamaged SNF cladding. Aqueous corrosion concerns, associated with exfoliation of the protective oxide layer, are addressed with a qualitative argument, focusing on the possible corrosion mechanisms of zirconium-based cladding...|$|R
