30|$|In this section, we {{analyze the}} BER of the THCL system {{employing}} the relay processing schemes considered in section 3, when BPSK baseband modulation is assumed. Our analysis {{is based on}} the assumptions that the S-R <b>channels,</b> the MA <b>channels</b> and BC <b>channels</b> for information exchange, and the R-D <b>channels</b> experience independent fading. Specifically, the S-R <b>channels</b> experience the independent and identically distributed (iid) Nakagami-m fading, the same occurs with the MA/BC <b>channels</b> and the R-D <b>channels.</b> However, the fading parameters characterizing the S-R <b>channels,</b> MA/BC <b>channels</b> and the R-D <b>channels</b> may be different. Additionally, we consider the special cases, where the S-R and R-D <b>channels</b> experience Nakagami-m fading, while the MA/BC <b>channels</b> are AWGN <b>channels,</b> in order to demonstrate that the energy spent for relay cooperation cannot be ignored even in this over-optimistic communication environments.|$|R
25|$|Like {{voltage-gated}} sodium <b>channels,</b> voltage-gated calcium <b>channels</b> {{are also}} integral membrane proteins {{found in the}} plasma membrane. Voltage-gated calcium <b>channels</b> generate action potentials by the same mechanisms as voltage-gated sodium <b>channels.</b> Various voltage-gated calcium <b>channels</b> {{have been identified in}} neurons. N- and P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium <b>channels</b> are the primary subtypes found to support synaptic transmission. These <b>channels</b> are concentrated at nerve terminals. T-type and R-type voltage-gated calcium <b>channels</b> have been found in basal dendrites, and it is thought that the activation of these <b>channels</b> during action potential bursts lead to the generation of dendritic calcium spikes.
