40|$|Various {{aspects of}} embryonic, larval and {{juvenile}} {{development in the}} <b>common</b> <b>gudgeon</b> (Gobio gobio L.) * as well as hatching {{and the use of}} hormonal stimulation of spawning were already described by Peňáz and Prokeš (1978). Prokeš and Peňáz (1979) also published a description of the larval and ju-venile period. Kouřil et al. (2000) studied hormo-nally induced ovulation in gudgeon females using the carp pituitary and GnRH analogue. Similarly, Kestemont (1988) carried out artificial stripping in the gudgeon. Data on the rate of fertilization, unsticking of fish eggs and subsequent rearing of the gudgeon are, however, missing. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the suitabil-ity of <b>common</b> <b>gudgeon</b> in embryo-larval tests. Even though OECD (1992 or 1998) methods 210 and 212 do not mention the gudgeon as a model species for embryonic and embryo-larval tests of toxicity, the importance of its use lies in cyto-genetic studies evaluating chromosomal aberra-tions. Regarding the relatively large chromosome...|$|E
40|$|Distribution data on many {{freshwater}} fish species in Croatia are scarce and species identifications are difficult, requiring further detailed studies. This paper presents {{a report of}} the Italian gudgeon Romanogobio benacensis from the Mirna River in the Istra Peninsula in Croatia, in the south-east from its previously known distribution range. The identification of R. benacensis in Croatia was supported by a morphological comparison with R. benacensis from Italy and Slovenia, the <b>common</b> <b>gudgeon</b> Gobio gobio, and the Danubian gudgeon Gobio obtusirostris from geographically close locations. A combination of character states (number of scales between anus and anal-fin origin, branched pectoral-fin rays, lateral-line scales, total, abdominal, and caudal vertebrae, and the size and number of lateral blotches) distinguishes R. benacensis from both G. gobio and G. obtusirostris. The phylogenetic analyses using mitochondrial sequences of cytochrome b gene confirmed that specimens from the Mirna River belong to R. benacensis. Also, Reka River system (Adriatic Sea basin) in Slovenia is inhabited by a possibly introduced Danubian gudgeon, G. obtusirostris, and not by R. benacensis...|$|E
40|$|Diel {{changeover}} of fish assemblages in inshore habitats of lowland rivers is a world-wide phenomenon. Predator avoidance, resources partitioning {{and differences}} in food availability are usually given as main drivers of variation observed in fish presence. Researches performed in different European rivers have led to contradictory results, indicating either nocturnal or diurnal increase in species richness and abundance. It has been hypothesized that relative differences in availability of certain type of habitats (inshore vs. offshore) resulting from various size (discharge) of rivers might explain these discrepancies. We performed a series of 24 -h samplings at three rivers differing in discharge: Vistula (~ 120 m 3 s- 1), Nida (~ 22 m 3 s- 1), and Czarna Nida (~ 5 m 3 s- 1). Fish were caught by fine-meshed beach seine nets (6 × 2 m or 15 × 3 m) every 3 h in May, July/August and November 2014 and February 2015. We caught 1792 specimens classified into 24 species. In all instances the communities were dominated by small-sized cyprinids (dace, bleak, <b>common</b> <b>gudgeon,</b> whitefin gudgeon, and roach). NMDS ordination indicated {{a clear distinction between}} diurnal and nocturnal samples. PERMANOVA supported significance of time of day on the structure of fish assemblages. Despite seasonal modifications, in all three rivers an uniform pattern of diel changes in the composition of fishes occurred. Both species richness and abundance noticeably increased just after the dusk, then consecutively decreased towards the dawn and remained at constantly lower levels during the daytime. This suggests that overall changeover of fish assemblage reflects interspecific interactions ongoing in a given stream section and species composition might explain differences observed between various rivers better than the river discharge...|$|E

50|$|The gudgeon inhabits {{all kinds}} of fresh-water {{habitats}} with sandy bottoms. It is a gregarious species, and feeds on benthic invertebrates. Its life span is up to five years. Gudgeons are usually smaller than 12 cm, rarely over 15 cm long. The <b>common</b> name <b>gudgeon</b> may also refer to other species of fish.|$|R
50|$|The {{river is}} a habitat {{for a variety}} of fish {{including}} brown trout, <b>common</b> dace, the <b>gudgeon</b> gobio gobio, stone loach and common minnow. There is an unusual isolated population of dormice in the Wych Valley, {{as a result of an}} introduction of animals in 1996/7.|$|R
50|$|Aquatic fauna once {{included}} {{fish species}} such as short-finned eel, <b>common</b> galaxias, flat-headed <b>gudgeon</b> and small-mouth hardyhead. These may still survive in refuges such as Pirron Yaloak creek and various freshwater springs flowing from the stony rises on the south {{west side of the}} lake. Springs on the south east side have dried - possibly due to over exploitation of the Warrion Aquifer for irrigation. More recently the fauna included brine shrimp and a species of isopod.|$|R
50|$|The common galaxias (Galaxias maculatus) or inanga (from the Māori īnanga) {{is a very}} {{widespread}} Southern Hemisphere fish in {{the family}} Galaxiidae. It is slim, narrow fish with a forked tail and a mottled, spotty pattern, typically about 10 cm long when fully grown. It lives in fresh water, but spawns at river mouths and spends {{the first six months}} of its life at sea, returning en masse in spring. Its vernacular names include cowfish, jollytail, <b>common</b> jollytail, eel <b>gudgeon,</b> inaka, native trout, pulangi, slippery tarki, spotted minnow and whitebait.|$|R
50|$|The park {{is highly}} {{representative}} of Chuvashia's animal life. Over 90% {{of the species}} found in the Chuvash Republic are found in Chavash Vermane. Records indicate 40 species of mammals, 170 species of birds (90 of which are nesting or breeding in the park), 16 species of amphibians or reptiles, and 19 species of fish. The types of animals expected {{to be found in}} pine and broadleaf temperate forest are found in the territory: hare, squirrel, badger, polecat, mink, marten, pond frogs, etc. Since establishment of the park, hunting has been prohibited and brown bear, wolves, and beaver have returned. A count of the fish in the rivers and floodplain lakes showed nine species - Chub, Dace, Striped bystranka, <b>Common</b> roach, <b>Gudgeon,</b> Tench, Ide, Loach, and Trout - accounting for 95% of the catch. In recent years, the park reports crayfish in the rivers, described as an indicator of improving water cleanliness. Birds of prey include the near-threatened Pallid harrier and the vulnerable Greater spotted eagle.|$|R
40|$|An {{invasive}} species {{is defined as}} an alien (or introduced or non-native) species whose establishment and spread threaten ecosystems, habitats or species with harm. Such threats to UK lake fish communities have long been appreciated and this review assembles case histories, including new data, from the largest lakes of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and England to examine the hypothesis {{that at least some}} of these introductions have become invasive. Loch Lomond in Scotland has experienced six introductions [chub (Leuciscus cephalus), common bream (Abramis brama), crucian carp (Carassius carassius), dace (Leuciscus leuciscus), gudgeon (Gobio gobio) and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) ], of which the most significant has been that of the percid ruffe, which has been implicated in a recent decline of the native coregonid whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). In Northern Ireland, the introduction of the cyprinid roach (Rutilus rutilus) to Lough Neagh has apparently had a negative impact on some overwintering waterfowl, although the native coregonid pollan (Coregonus autumnalis) remains abundant. Llyn Tegid in Wales has received three introductions [rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus), ruffe and silver bream (Blicca bjoerkna) ], although no impacts on the native whitefish or other fish populations have been observed. In England, individuals of at least 12 native and non-native fish species have been brought to Windermere for the purpose of live-baiting, although only those of the cyprinids roach and common bream have established abundant populations. At the same time, the native salmonid Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) has declined markedly while the native esocid pike (Esox lucius) has shown changes in abundance, distribution and individual condition, although these developments have not been shown to be causally linked. None of these introductions were sanctioned by appropriate fisheries or other regulatory bodies and almost all of them probably arose from the release or escape of live-bait used by pike anglers. Of the 10 species introductions documented here, four (<b>common</b> bream, <b>gudgeon,</b> roach and ruffe) have established abundant populations and two of these (roach and ruffe) have apparently caused or currently threaten harm, supporting the hypothesis {{that at least some of}} these introductions have become invasive...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{conditions}} (velocity, depth, turbulence) strongly {{influence the}} distribution and abundance of organisms in rivers. A diverse hydraulic environment should foster biodiversity, because organisms have different hydraulic preferences. In fact, the relationship between spatial hydraulic diversity and biodiversity is largely presumed, and not well-supported by empirical studies, but it underpins efforts in river restoration and conservation. This is particularly so at the reach scale, indicating a stream- or river-section with large-scale homogeneous geomorphic and hydrological conditions and smaller-scale habitat patches, as perceived by organisms in the community under study. This thesis considers the factors that create spatial hydraulic diversity, and the ways that fish respond. It presents a method to characterise hydraulic diversity, and uses this to describe temporal and spatial changes between reaches. It also demonstrates the use of hydraulic modelling for comparing reaches. Finally, it assesses the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) as a method to describe hydraulic conditions in a large, open river channel. Swimming ability tests were applied to three small freshwater fish, the pelagic Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni) and common galaxias (Galaxias maculatus) and the demersal flathead gudgeon (Philypnodon grandiceps). The latter species was the weaker swimmer, but the tests indicated that behaviour also should be considered. A laboratory experiment was designed to investigate how two species with contrasting ecological habits (<b>common</b> galaxias, flathead <b>gudgeon)</b> behave in a diverse hydraulic environment. Habitat choices and activity were monitored in a constructed sinuous channel at three discharges over a 3 -hour period. The galaxias favoured the pelagic habitat, and spent 20 - 60 % of the time cruising, whereas the flathead gudgeon preferred the demersal habitat and spent 1. 5 m, but modified instrumentation may overcome this limitation. Six reaches, including weir-pool and free-flowing sections, were compared at two discharges in the River Murray, Australia. Variograms derived from the ADCP data clearly demonstrated spatial differences between the sections, but temporal differences were less well-defined, suggesting that reaches may retain characteristic hydraulic patterns despite changes in discharge. Opportunities for further research include: the issue of optimal levels of hydraulic diversity for fish and other biota; use of variograms {{as a tool for}} field studies of aquatic biota; and measuring reach-scale hydraulic diversity and biodiversity before and after reach manipulation (e. g. the placement of wood), to elucidate the effects of changes in spatial hydraulic diversity on reach biodiversity.
