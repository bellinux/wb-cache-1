For the problem, several heuristic algo-rithms are developed using greedy search methods and simulation. In the heuristic algorithms, the numbers of <b>tool</b> <b>copies</b> for certain <b>tool</b> types are increased until they cannot be increased any more because of the budget limit. Simulation results are used to deter-mine search directions or to select tool types of which the numbers of copies are to be increased.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Good tool {{management}} and job operating strategies {{will result in}} reduction in tool inventory and associated costs. Very little empirical {{research has been conducted}} on a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) as a whole in relation to its performances with tool movement approach, specifically in a dynamic job shop in a tool shared environment. This study evaluated job loading rules and tool selection policies in a tool shared environment with regards to the job shop performance as a whole. This research also examined the relationship between job loading rules and tool selection policies when tool movement approach was employed. A process oriented manufacturing system simulation procedure was used as the theoretical framework for this research, which was pursued in two phases. The first phase was focused on the development of a generalized simulation model and identification of the bottleneck conditions and merits of different simple rules. The second phase, then, was emphasized on development of bi-criterion rules and determining the "best" strategies used for bottlenecks under different simulation models and operating conditions. This research concentrated on heuristic rules. The nature of the study was observational, in which computer simulation outputs were collected and analyzed by multifactor analysis of variance, Fisher's Least Significant Difference method, and non-parametric tests. Experimental designs were used for comparing job loading rules and tool selection policies, as well as shop operating conditions. Significant differences were found among job loading rules, tool duplication levels, and tool selection policies. Furthermore, significant interaction effects were also observed between some independent factors. Job loading rules play the most important role in the system performance, specially with more <b>tool</b> <b>copies.</b> <b>Tool</b> selection policies affect the percent tardy jobs with single <b>tool</b> <b>copy.</b> It is noticed that in the multiple-machine and multiple-tool situations higher machine utilization can be obtained at higher tool duplication levels.

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{under which}} conditions SCD’s work with implementing a lean mindset and behaviour at key suppliers is successful. To help fulfilling the purpose this thesis aims {{to answer the}} question: What affects how the production unit of a Scania key supplier adopts a lean mindset and behaviour with focus on continuous improvements? Methodology An exploratory multiple case study with a qualitative data analysis and inductive approach. The cases consist of five Swedish first-tier suppliers to Scania CV AB, and a pilot case study conducted at Scania, Södertälje. Result The case study resulted in a categorisation of suppliers into three groups based on their characteristics and ability to adopt a lean mindset and behaviour: Group I:  Lack of direction, inconsistent management culture, no deeper understanding or interest in lean, no involvement or responsibility of operators in improvement work, a tendency to <b>copy</b> <b>tools</b> and methods given by external help directly into the organisation. Group II:  Strong sense of direction, strong management culture, a personal interest in lean and improvements, an “us and them” culture between managers and operators, and a strong sense to develop tools and working methods in-house and be very restrictive with applying external thoughts in the organisation. Group III: Clear long-term direction; primarily evident among managers, clear targets on an operational level to guide {{the rest of the}} organisation, a supportive management culture, an expectation on operators to perform improvement work, and openness to external help but a strong sense of filtering and adapting to the own organisation. Conclusion Our conclusion is that SCD is variously successful due to that the same approach has been used despite different needs of the suppliers. The recommendation is to analyse suppliers with tools provided in this research and adapt the development approach to specific supplier needs: Group I: No prioritisation of long-term development of this group. Group II: Provide guiding from experience to management team, focus workshop on operators and their nearest contact points. Group III: Provide possible solutions to specific problems...|$|R

40|$|Typically used to save space, non-lossy data {{compression}} can {{save time and}} energy during communication if the cost to compress and send data {{is less than the}} cost of sending uncompressed data. However, compression can degrade efficiency if it compresses insufficiently or delays the operation significantly, which can depend on many factors. Because predicting the best strategy is risky and difficult, compression (if available) is typically manually controlled, resulting in missed opportunities and avoidable losses. This dissertation describes Datacomp, a general-purpose Adaptive Compression (AC) framework that improves efficiency in terms of time, space and energy for real-world workloads on real-world systems like laptops and smartphones. Prior systems are limited in important ways or rely on external hosts for prediction and compression, reducing their effectiveness or imposing unnecessary dependencies. In contrast, Datacomp is a Local Adaptive Compression system capable of choosing between numerous compressors using system monitors, a novel compressibility estimation technique and a history mechanism. Datacomp wraps system calls with AC capabilities, enabling applications to benefit with little modification. I also built Comptool, an off-line "AC oracle" for investigation and validation. Comptool, which includes LEAP energy-measurement capabilities, identifies the best-case compression strategy for a given scenario, highlighting critical factors for AC and providing a valuable standard against which to compare systems such as Datacomp. I evaluated two Datacomp-enabled utilities: drcp, a throughput-sensitive remote <b>copy</b> <b>tool</b> and dzip, an AC-enabled compression utility. I collected hundreds of megabytes of nine common but distinct classes of data to serve as workloads, including web traces, binaries, email and collections of personal data from volunteers. Experiments were performed using both Comptool and Datacomp while varying the data type, bandwidth, CPU load, frequency, and more. Up to and including 100 Mbit/s, Datacomp consistently came within 1 - 3 % of the best strategy identified by Comptool, improving throughput for realistic types by up to 74 % over no compression, and up to 45 % over zlib compression. Comptool generated strategies that could improve efficiency at gigabit speeds (over no compression) by up to 28 % for Wikipedia data and 14 % for Facebook data...|$|R

40|$|In the {{planning}} process of flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), an FMS must not be designed to fulfill its intended functions only, but also to perform the intended functions successfully. The latter requires the design of reliability into the system. The decisions involving the number of tools and tool redundancies need to be carried and executed in real time. This research discusses FMS tooling reliability {{in the context of}} the machine loading and part assignment problem. As manufacturing systems become more and more complex, competition and cost grow even more rapidly. Flexible manufacturing systems became the means to narrow the gap between the various different pressures. FMS promises more efficient and effective ways of utilizing resources, information and assets, due to its capability to carry a variety of different tools so that it can perform different operations required in the production of a variety of low to mid size part types. Integer-programming models are developed. The formulations consider an objective function with a set of governing constraints. A reliability level is decided for the tooling system, the models then will return with optimum number of <b>tools</b> and <b>tool</b> <b>copies</b> for each <b>tool</b> type. The overall objective is cost minimization while achieving maximum desired tooling system for the FMS under consideration. Two distinct scenarios are studied, the first considers an FMS where tool sharing is not allowed which implies that each tool magazine will be required to carry the required <b>tools</b> and <b>tool</b> <b>copies</b> to achieve the reliability levels decided and to carry the required machining operations on the different parts assigned to it during each production period. The second scenario is where tool sharing is permitted; in this case if a tool is not available on a particular tool magazine it can be borrowed from another magazine or from the tool crib. Two Genetic algorithms are developed and used to solve the two cases, the solutions are compared to solutions obtained by LINGO optimization software and conclusions are derived. The research conducted in this thesis is aimed at developing cost minimization models for the part assignment and tool loading in flexible manufacturing systems with reliability considerations. The thesis of this research states that tooling system reliability can be integrated in FMS planning decisions, and that such models will complement some of the apparent limitations in the existing models. The models aim at assessing decision-maker to decide a minimum tooling system reliability and to optimize overall processing and tooling cost of the part assignment and tool loading of FMS. A solution methodology is also presented in this thesis. The solution takes into account part assignment and tool loading along with tooling system reliability of FMS under consideration.

LOH regions were identified by two methods – using Affymetrix's genotype call software and using Affymetrix's <b>copy</b> number alteration <b>tool</b> (CNAT) software – and both approaches yielded similar results. Non-random LOH regions were found on 10 chromosomal arms (in decreasing order of frequency: 17 p, 9 p, 9 q, 13 q, 17 q, 4 q, 4 p, 3 p, 15 q, and 5 q), including 20 novel LOH regions (10 kb to 4. 26 Mb). Fifteen CNA-loss regions (200 kb to 4. 3 Mb) and 36 CNA-gain regions (200 kb to 9. 3 Mb) were also identified. Conclusion These studies demonstrate that the Affymetrix 10 K SNP chip is a valid platform to integrate analyses of LOH and CNA.

Initial vibration related to the dynamic behavior of the machine <b>tool</b> <b>copy</b> on the grinding wheel and its amplitude amplifies by abra-sion. To ensure high workpiece quality many expensive truing cycles are needed. In this context, we suggest a new set-up for the auto-matic chatter detection and elimination for external cylindrical grinding machines, reducing not only the high amount of true running cycles, but also improving the efficiency. In order to suppress the generation of the waviness on the grinding wheel the effect has to be identified during an early stage of its development. Therefore, a grinding machine is equipped with different types of sensors, i. e., eddy current, force, acoustic emission, acceleration sensors, and a tactile probe. Experimental results show, that exclusively measuring the displacement at the workpiece is sufficient for online computing wheel's waviness. Based on a model of the grinding process the other redundant sensors are used for validation. In addition, a robust online chatter detector based on the wavelet transformation is developed recognizing an instable grinding process. This model-based detection and estimation of waviness delivers solid results, it should be used for suppression of chatter in further work...|$|R
