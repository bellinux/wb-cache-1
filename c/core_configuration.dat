40|$|Recently, {{mitigation}} of blast effects {{has become}} one of the major challenges in structural engineering. In this regard, sandwich panels are considered attractive systems for blast mitigation applications. This is contributed to their considerable energy absorption capability compared to solid panels of the same weight. These sandwich panels can have different inner <b>core</b> <b>configurations</b> to provide adequate stiffness, strength, and energy absorption for resisting different blast loads. This research evaluates numerically the effectiveness of using woven shapes as a new core topology in sandwich panels to act as a suppressive layer for resisting blast loads. The new shape has been studied for both fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) sandwich panels and metallic sandwich panels. The numerical models have been created using nonlinear explicit finite element simulation. Each model has been validated using available data in the literature that uses honeycomb and folded shapes. The results of proposed woven shapes have been compared to those of honeycomb and folded shapes to examine the effectiveness of using woven shape in blast mitigation. Throughout the study, twelve FRP panels with different inner <b>core</b> <b>configurations</b> are proposed to enhance panels' performance by reducing their peak deformation and increasing their energy dissipation. A parametric study was conducted on the best performing inner <b>core</b> <b>configurations</b> to achieve the highest resistance for blast loads. Moreover, the study investigates the effect of filling the FRP sandwich panels with sand, polyurethane foam, and dytherm foam on the panels' blast resistance. In order to generalize the findings of this research, other panels with the new proposed inner <b>core</b> <b>configurations</b> are simulated using stainless steel instead of FRP. Finally, the effect of changing the outer layers' thickness, applying successive blast loads on the same sandwich panels, and changing scaled distance has been investigated for metallic sandwich panels. Comparing woven shapes to honeycomb and folded shapes shows that using sandwich panels with woven shapes provides a better impulsive resistance...|$|R
