25|$|On 29 July 1666, {{by order}} of Mr. du Puy (or Dupuy), subdelegate of Claude Pellot, Intendant of Guyenne in Bordeaux, Louis de Forcade, Seigneur de Caubeyran, Jean de Forcade, Seigneur de Saint-Genest, Jean-Silvestre de Forcade, Seigneur de Lastranencq, Mathieu, Pierre and Bertrand de Forcade, brothers, Squires, were all {{relieved}} of the summons that {{had been given to}} them at the request of Nicolas Catel, commissioner responsible for the research, and maintained in their nobility, after proving their lineage from those mentioned in Jean de Forcade's 1505 testament, and paying 180 livres as a <b>confirmation</b> <b>fee</b> for enjoying the benefit of the letters of rehabilitation accorded to their fathers.|$|E
40|$|We {{have worked}} out {{research}} and development of a system which forms a basis of e-learning for cellular phone users. In order to develop such a system, it is important to analyze present disadvantages of the e-learning system using cellular phone and to supply basic environments to it. Therefore, we have firstly defined our unique learning contents description format, QDF, and secondly developed both a learning management system (LMS) and an application to the mobile phone (i-appli) by employing Java language. The LMS offers functions such as QDF grammatical check, registration and reading of record information on a collection of problems, reading of explanation on QDF, etc., to a producer of problems. It also serves as transmission of a collection of problems, registration of record information and so on, to an e-learner. The application i-appli provides various kinds of functions to the learner, for example, retrieval and answer to the collection of problems, functions of automatic marking, interruption and resuming, and <b>confirmation</b> of utilization <b>fee.</b> We have verified both the originally developed LMS and i-appli are well operated as a learning support system by uploading them to a server. ...|$|R
40|$|Botnets, {{in other}} means zombie {{computers}} that await for instructions to execute, {{are the greatest}} threat in the internet today. They {{are one of the}} leading sources of online crime. Criminals are {{able to take advantage of}} using botnets and threaten online businesses, organizations or any entity in the internet. Criminals design and implement botnets in a complex way in order to hide their identities. Most notably the fact that criminals build command-and-control (C&C) infrastructures to manage their botnets. A botnet command-and-control mechanism (C&C) can be designed in various ways. The key principle behind designing a C&C mechanism is anonymity. Hence, criminals can propagate their instructions to botnets without revealing their identities. Since every new C&C mechanism increases the bar of anonymity, it is getting harder to trace and analyze botnets. In this thesis, we designed and implemented a C&C mechanism, btc-botnet, that runs over Bitcoin network. Btcbotnet has significant features over existing C&C mechanisms such as anonymity and resistance by its nature. We built a library that allows to use Bitcoin network as an underlying infrastructure for C&C mechanism. We evaluate our work and show that its feasibility in terms of metrics such as response time, <b>confirmation</b> time and <b>fees...</b>|$|R
