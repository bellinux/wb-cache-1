40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the results of {{studying}} the impact of discharge <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> on electrode surface area of high-current low-inductance vacuum spark. Iron electrodes were utilized for research. It was discovered that the size of periodic structure cells on a cathode surface decreased from 600 nm (63 kA) to 150 nm (180 kA) as the discharge <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> grew along with switching to the micropinching mode. The discharge <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> exerted no significant impact on the size of structure elements on anode surface (the structure size at all currents was ∼ 400 nm) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{stoichiometric}} {{network analysis}} (SNA) the instability condition is calculated by the <b>current</b> <b>rates.</b> Recently, {{we have shown}} that in the final result the <b>current</b> <b>rates</b> can be substituted by reaction rates, which is a more appropriate value for the examination of instability from experimental point of view. Here, we elaborate the problem of whether the <b>current</b> <b>rates</b> are necessary parameters in the calculation, {{with the aim of}} obtaining the region of instability. All calculations are performed on a model for Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, which has not been examined by SNA...|$|R
40|$|This paper, through {{simulating}} an {{open economy}} model of China, investigates whether the <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> of saving in China is excessive. The model incorporates the major {{factors that influence}} optimal saving, namely demographic change, the catch-up of total factor productivity in China {{to the level of}} high-income OECD countries, and an endogenous world rate of interest. The paper finds that the rate of time preference that would imply the <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> of saving is optimal is very low; in fact, it is negative. Thus, to justify China's <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> of saving, the social planner would have to put a higher weight on the economic welfare of future generations relative to the current generation, indeed up to 19 times the weight. This suggests that the <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> of saving in China is excessive. Saving, China, living standards...|$|R

40|$|We generalize Ohlson (1995) to {{stochastic}} interest rates. Our analysis provides four insights. First, {{the earnings}} capitalization multiple {{depends on the}} lagged <b>rate,</b> not the <b>current</b> <b>rate.</b> Second, the abnormal earnings persistence parameter increases in the <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> and decreases in the lagged rate. Third, {{it is not necessary}} to specify the stochastic process underlying interest rates to relate stock prices and accounting numbers. Finally, only the lagged rate is needed to capitalize current earnings to determine current stock price, while both the lagged and <b>current</b> <b>rates</b> are needed to forecast next-period earnings based on current earning...|$|R
50|$|The {{stochastic}} part {{is purely}} random; it can either help the <b>current</b> interest <b>rate</b> deviate from its long term mean or the reverse. Because this part is {{multiplied by the}} square root of the <b>current</b> interest <b>rate,</b> when the <b>current</b> interest <b>rate</b> is low, its impact is minimum, thus leading to the unlikelihood of the interest rate going below zero, and the interest rate cannot be negative. However, {{the reverse is true}} if the <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> is high.|$|R

30|$|During {{the rate}} performance, the TO/PANI {{composites}} exhibited better capacity retention when the <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> eventually increased to 160  mAg− 1. The capacities of pure TO reduced to 70.1  mAh g− 1 at a <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> of 160  mAg− 1 (at {{the end of}} tenth cycle), which is 30  % retention of this at the initial stage. The TO 10 PA, TO 15 PA and TO 20 PA showed the capacities of 83.1, 123.1 and 85.9  mAh g− 1 respectively which are 42, 44 and 34  % of the capacities of the initial stage at a <b>current</b> <b>rate</b> of 20  mAg− 1. This indicates the improved capacity rate of TO/PANI composites compared with pure TO.|$|R
25|$|The surge <b>current</b> <b>rating</b> of film {{capacitors}} can {{be enhanced}} by various internal configurations. Because metallization is the cheapest way of producing electrodes, optimizing {{the shape of the}} electrodes is one way to minimize the internal resistance and to increase the current-carrying capacity. A slightly thicker metallization layer at the schoopage contact sides of the electrodes results in a lower overall contact resistance and increased surge current handling, without losing the self-healing properties throughout the remainder of the metallization.|$|E

Common Sense Media began allowing studios to use their ratings and endorsements in order to promote family-friendly movies in 2014. The first film to use the endorsement was Disney’s Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.|$|E
25|$|An ammeter shunt is {{a special}} type of current-sensing resistor, having four {{terminals}} and a value in milliohms or even micro-ohms. Current-measuring instruments, by themselves, can usually accept only limited currents. To measure high currents, the current passes through the shunt across which the voltage drop is measured and interpreted as current. A typical shunt consists of two solid metal blocks, sometimes brass, mounted on an insulating base. Between the blocks, and soldered or brazed to them, are one or more strips of low {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) manganin alloy. Large bolts threaded into the blocks make the current connections, while much smaller screws provide volt meter connections. Shunts are rated by full-scale current, and often have a voltage drop of 50 mV at rated current. Such meters are adapted to the shunt full <b>current</b> <b>rating</b> by using an appropriately marked dial face; no change need to be made to the other parts of the meter.|$|E

Discussion is moderated by a user-based moderation system. Randomly selected moderators are assigned points (typically 5) which they can use to rate a comment.

500|$|Psycho {{has been}} rated and re-rated {{several times over}} the years by the MPAA. Upon its initial release, the film {{received}} a certificate stating that it was [...] "Approved" [...] (certificate #19564) under the simple pass/fail system of the Production Code in use at that time. Later, when the MPAA switched to a voluntary letter ratings system in 1968, Psycho was {{one of a number of}} high-profile motion pictures to be retro-rated with an [...] "M" [...] (Mature Audiences). This remained the only rating the film would receive for 16 years, and according to the guidelines of the time [...] "M" [...] was the equivalent of a [...] "PG" [...] rating. Then, in 1984, during the uproar of increased parental concern regarding violence in [...] "PG" [...] films, Psycho was retro-rated again to its <b>current</b> <b>rating</b> of [...] "R". This rating took effect, however, before the institution of the [...] "PG-13" [...] rating by the MPAA that same year, and there are those who have speculated that if the rating had existed at the time, or if Psycho were rated in America today, it would receive a [...] "PG-13".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{technique}} {{to increase the}} surge <b>current</b> <b>rating</b> for film capacitors is a double-sided metallization.
