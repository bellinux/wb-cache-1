Detection of NGF mRNA was also performed by in situ hybridization. Immunoreaction for NGF and the two receptors in articular chondrocytes, chondrocyte-like cells of meniscus and annulus fibrosus, and chondrocytes of the epiglottis demonstrated that they are all expressed in hyaline, fibrous and elastic <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissues,</b> suggesting that they could be involved in cartilage physio-pathology...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cartilaginous</b> <b>tissues,</b> such as {{articular}} cartilage and the annulus fibrosus, exhibit orthotropic behavior with highly asymmetric tensile–compressive responses. Due to this complex behavior, {{it is difficult}} to develop accurate stress constitutive equations that are valid for finite deformations. Therefore, we have developed a bimodular theory for finite deformations of elastic materials that allows the mechanical properties of the tissue to differ in tension and compression. In this paper, we derive an orthotropic stress constitutive equation that is second-order in terms of the Biot strain tensor as an alternative to traditional exponential type equations. Several reduced forms of the bimodular second-order equation, with six to nine parameters, and a bimodular exponential equation, with seven parameters, were fit to an experimental dataset that captures the highly asymmetric and orthotropic mechanical response of cartilage. The results suggest that the bimodular second-order models may be appealing for some applications with <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissues...</b>|$|R
5000|$|A paper {{published}} in 2008 by Fiorelli and Calvo described new {{remains of the}} type species N. terrestris.

The anteriorly directed nares {{and the absence of}} a bony nasal septum (which presumably indicates <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissue</b> serving its place) provide evidence for a trunk-like snout, while striations {{on the surface of the}} nasal bones and the lower jaw most likely acted as attachment points for the nasolabial muscles and the depressor muscle, respectively. Additionally, the authors suggested that a lateral rim on the dentary as well as numerous aligned neurovascular foramina are evidence of soft cheek-like muscular tissue. The function of the trunk was likely used for searching for food by sniffing the ground in a manner similar to extant suids and peccaries, while the cheeks would aid in mastication by preventing food loss.|$|E

50|$|Cartilage {{and bone}} {{development}} {{have proven to}} be dependent upon perlecan expression. The protein becomes visible by immunostaining on day 15 during mouse development, independently from other basement membrane proteins, suggesting that it is simply a part of the ECM of developing chondrocytes, in addition to collagen II and other cartilage markers that are expressed starting on day 12. Taken with the data, that mice lacking the pln gene cannot maintain stable cartilage, it is apparent that perlecan is essential to the maturation and stability of cartilaginous structure. This is supported by a study showing that knockdown of perlecan production inhibits the final stages of chondrogenic differentiation in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts in culture. Bone development, i.e. mineralization of <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissue,</b> correlates with loss of perlecan and heparan sulfate at the chondro-osseous junction (COJ). In an effort to understand how heparan sulfate and perlecan direct mesenchymal stem cells into the osteogenic pathway, human mesenchymal stem cells were treated with heparanase and chondroitinase in culture. This led to increased mineralization and expression of osteocyte markers, supporting the data showing that loss of heparan sulfate at the COJ is a key factor in osteogenesis. It is thought that the driving force behind heparanase and chondroitinase activation of osteogenesis is release of bone morphogenetic protein bound in the heparan sulfate chains.|$|E
40|$|A collagenous {{extracellular}} matrix was previously {{considered to be}} a requirement for classification of true cartilage. Data from the lamprey and hagfish now clearly indicate that both of these jawless craniates have extensive non-collagenous, yet cartilaginous endoskeletons. Non-collagenous cartilages are present in the cephalochordates (amphioxus) and in the invertebrates, although collagen-containing cartilages also are found in the invertebrates. This review summarizes current knowledge of the morphological, biochemical and molecular characteristics of the unusual non-collagenous cartilages in jawless craniates and the <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissues</b> in amphioxus and invertebrates. A least two types of non-collagenous cartilage matrix proteins are found in both the hagfishes and the lampreys, all of which are resistant to digestion by cyanogen bromide (CNBr). Although all four of these matrices show some similarities with each other, suggesting a family of non-collagenous, elastin-like proteins, {{it is clear that the}} major matrix proteins of each are different. New morphological and biochemical information on the <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissues</b> in squid, horseshoe crab and amphioxus reveals the presence of CNBr-insoluble, non-collagenous matrix proteins, potentially extending the jawless craniate family of cartilaginous proteins into the invertebrates. Details of the evolutionary relationships between these non-collagenous matrix proteins and the significance of the occurrence of these proteins as the major components of the <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissues</b> of jawless craniates, amphioxus, horseshoe crab and squid, all of which are capable of producing a variety of collagens in other tissues, remain to be investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the functional properties of <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissues</b> generated by porcine MSCs isolated from different tissue sources, and to compare these properties to those derived from chondrocytes (CC). MSCs were isolated from bone marrow (BM) and infrapatellar fat pad (FP), while CC were harvested from the articular surface of the femoro-patellar joint. Culture-expanded CC and MSCs were encapsulated in agarose hydrogels and cultured in the presence of TGF-? 3. Samples were analysed biomechanically, biochemically and histologically at day 0, day 21 and day 42. After 42 days in free swelling culture, mean GAG content was 1. 50 % w/w in CC seeded constructs, compared to 0. 95 % w/w in FP and 0. 43 % w/w in BM seeded constructs. Total collagen accumulation was highest in FP constructs. DNA content increased with time for all the groups. The mechanical functionality of <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissues</b> engineered using CCs was superior to that generated from either source of MSCs. Differences were also observed in the spatial distribution of matrix components in tissues engineered using CC and MSCs, which appears to have a strong influence on the apparent mechanical properties of the constructs.

5000|$|An endo{{skeleton}} is {{a skeleton}} {{that is on}} the inside of a body. The endoskeleton develops within the skin or in the deeper body tissues. The vertebrate endoskeleton is basically made up of two types of tissues (bone and cartilage). During early embryonic development the endoskeleton is composed of notochord and cartilage. The notochord in most vertebrates is replaced by the vertebral column and cartilage is replaced by bone in most adults. In three phyla and one subclass of animals, endoskeletons of various complexity are found: Chordata, Echinodermata, Porifera, and Coleoidea. An endoskeleton may function purely for support (as in the case of sponges), but often serves as an attachment site for muscle and a mechanism for transmitting muscular forces. A true endoskeleton is derived from mesodermal tissue. Such a skeleton is present in echinoderms and chordates. The poriferan 'skeleton' consists of microscopic calcareous or siliceous spicules or a spongin network. The Coleoidae do not have a true endoskeleton in the evolutionary sense; there, a mollusk exoskeleton evolved into several sorts of internal structure, the [...] "cuttlebone" [...] of cuttlefish being the best-known version.

50|$|According to Padian, eight cervical, {{fourteen}} dorsal, {{three or}} four sacral and twenty-seven or twenty-eight caudal vertebrae are present. The exceptional fourth sacral {{is the first of}} the normal caudal series. The number of caudals is not certain because their limits are obscured by long thread-like extensions, stiffening the tail. The cervical vertebrae are rather long and strongly built, their upper surface having a roughly square cross-section. They carry double-headed thin cervical ribs. The dorsal vertebrae are more rounded with flat spines; the first {{three or four}} carry ribs that contact the sternal ribs; the more posterior ribs contact the gastralia. The first five or six, rather short, caudal vertebrae form a flexible tail base.

The defects were filled with polycaprolactone-polyurethane scaffolds of either 3 or 4 mm in height. Regeneration and repair of the defects were evaluated after 8 (n = 8) and 14 weeks (n = 8). After 8 weeks of implantation, both the 3 - and 4 -mm scaffolds were flush with the native cartilage. The amount of <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissue</b> was similar in both scaffold types. Pores located in the more central zones of the scaffolds contained less <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissue</b> when compared with pores located in the more superficial zones. After 14 weeks, significantly more <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissue</b> was present in 4 mm scaffolds when compared with the 3 -mm scaffolds (p = 0. 03).

Resulting constructs were implanted subcutaneously, at the dorsum of nude mice, for 4 weeks. Macroscopic observation, histological evaluation, gene expression and sulphated-glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) analyses were performed at each time point of 1, 2 and 4 weeks post-implantation. <b>Cartilaginous</b> <b>tissue</b> formation in fibrin/PLGA hybrid construct was confirmed by the presence of lacunae and cartilage-isolated cells embedded within basophilic ground substance.

40|$|Cartilage is {{a tissue}} with only limited reparative capacities. A {{small part of}} its volume is {{composed}} of cells, the remaining part being the hydrated extracellular matrix (ECM) with collagens and proteoglycans as its main constituents. The functioning of cartilage depends heavily on its ECM. Although {{it is known that}} the various (fibro) <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissues</b> (articular cartilage, annulus fibrosus, nucleus pulposus, and meniscus) differ from one each other with respect to their molecular make-up, remarkable little quantitative information is available with respect to its biochemical constituents, such as collagen content, or the various posttranslational modifications of collagen. Furthermore, we have noticed that tissue-engineering strategies to replace <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissues</b> pay in general little attention to the biochemical differences of the tissues or the phenotypical differences of the (fibro) chondrocytes under consideration. The goal of this paper is therefore to provide quantitative biochemical data from these tissues as a reference for further studies. We have chosen the goat as the source of these tissues, as this animal is widely accepted as an animal model in orthopaedic studies, e. g. in the field of cartilage degeneration and tissue engineering. Furthermore, we provide data on mRNA levels (from genes encoding proteins/enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of the ECM) from (fibro) chondrocytes that are freshly isolated from these tissues and from the same (fibro) chondrocytes that are cultured for 18 days in alginate beads. Expression levels of genes involved in the cross-linking of collagen were different between cells isolated from various <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissues.</b> This opens the possibility to include more markers than the commonly used chondrogenic markers type II collagen and aggrecan for cartilage tissue-engineering applications.

40|$|Swelling and {{shrinking}} of <b>cartilaginous</b> <b>tissues</b> is modelled by a four-component mixture theory. This theory {{results in}} a set of coupled non-linear partial differential equations for the electrochemical potentials and the displacement. For the sake of local mass conservation these equations are discretised in space by a mixed finite element method. Integration in time by backward Euler leads to a non-linear system of algebraic equations. A subtle solution strategy for this system is proposed and tested for one-dimensional situations...|$|R
