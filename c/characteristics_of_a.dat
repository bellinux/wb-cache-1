5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm. From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
5|$|Between 1845 and 1847, Belgian-French {{composer}} César Franck {{wrote an}} orchestral piece based on Victor Hugo's poem Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne. The work exhibits <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> symphonic poem, and some musicologists, such as Norman Demuth and Julien Tiersot, consider {{it the first}} of its genre, preceding Liszt's compositions. However, Franck did not publish or perform his piece; neither did he set about defining the genre. Liszt's determination to explore and promote the symphonic poem gained him recognition as the genre's inventor.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{of animals}} and plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent.

5|$|By 1980, Gulf {{exhibited}} {{many of the}} <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> giant {{corporation that}} had lost its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation was bound to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 {{was in the early}} 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.|$|E
5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E

5|$|Initially exhibiting <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> monsoonal low, a mid-level {{ridge to}} the south of Graham caused strong {{westerly}} winds that moved the storm slowly east-southeastward. However, a deep trough eroded the ridge, allowing the cyclone to move more towards the south. According to the JTWC, the storm had intensified late on 28 February, though {{at the same time the}} BoM noted the slight weakening of the storm. Graham reached its peak intensity that day while nearing the coast.|$|E
5|$|Lunar swirls are enigmatic {{features}} found {{across the}} Moon's surface, which {{are characterized by}} a high albedo, appearing optically immature (i.e. the optical <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relatively young regolith), and often displaying a sinuous shape.

5|$|Married people, however, {{are advised}} not to worship Dhumavati.

Thus, Dhumavati's worship is appropriate for world renouncers who roam as lone wanderers and widows who parallel the life of world renouncers. Dhumavati is also described a being partial to single persons and especially partial to widows. Widows are considered the only beings who can withstand her power.|$|E

5|$|Operationally, the National Hurricane Center {{determined}} if the non-tropical {{low that}} absorbed Nicholas {{developed into a}} tropical or subtropical storm, it would be named Odette. In post-season analysis, the center considered classifying the system as an unnumbered tropical depression, though lack of sufficient <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression prevented the classification. If Nicholas had attained hurricane status, {{it would have been}} one of eight tropical cyclones to reach hurricane status in October in the deep tropical Atlantic since 1900.|$|E

5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive.

Domestication was not a single event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled {{a couple hundred}} miles {{southeast}} of Bermuda on October 10. During that day, a strong upper-level trough moved southeastward off the southeast coast of the United States. Due to several factors, including upward motion and strong diffluence—the rate at which a fluid moves—the area became baroclinically unstable. This caused {{the interaction between the}} trough and the front to develop into an extratropical low about 345miles (555km) southeast of Bermuda on October 11. The low moved quickly northward, then northwestward, strengthening quickly due to the instability of the atmosphere. Late on October 11, the system slowed, and the upper-level circulation became aligned with the low-level circulation. The extratropical storm began to develop tropical characteristics late on October 11, including surface temperatures warmer than the surrounding environment, and vertical wind <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone. Based on its organization, the system developed into Subtropical Storm One early on October 12 while located about 35miles (55km) south of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|A {{semi-arid}} desert or a steppe is {{a version}} of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity. These regions feature a semi-arid climate and are less extreme than regular deserts. Like arid deserts, temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts. They share some <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250mm (10in) to 500mm (20in) but this can vary due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition. Semi deserts {{can be found in the}} Tabernas Desert (and some of the Spanish Plateau), The Sahel, The Eurasian Steppe, most of Central Asia, the Western US, most of Northern Mexico, portions of South America (especially in Argentina) and the Australian Outback. They usually feature BSh (hot steppe) or BSk (temperate steppe) in the Köppen climate classification.|$|E
5|$|A strong upper-level trough {{moving through}} the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward, which also {{triggered}} the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated {{that it did not}} have the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone. Therefore, it is not considered to be a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275mi (445km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel. As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones, and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids. By 1972, the National Hurricane Center officially recognized this cyclone category. Subtropical cyclones began to receive names off the official tropical cyclone list in the Atlantic Basin in 2002. They have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones, and exist in areas of weak to moderate temperature gradient.|$|E
