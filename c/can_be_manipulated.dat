5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Captain Martin Walker, who is sent into a post-catastrophe Dubai with an elite Delta Force team on a recon mission. As the game progresses, Walker's mental health deteriorates, {{as he begins}} to experience hallucinations and slowly realizes the horror of war. Players can hide behind cover, vault over obstacles, and shoot enemies while utilizing a variety of gadgets. Sand is a key gameplay mechanic that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>manipulated</b> to defeat enemies. Included with the game is an online multiplayer mode, developed separately by Darkside Game Studios, allowing players to engage in both cooperative and competitive gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Spoken {{language}} {{relies on}} human physical {{ability to produce}} sound, which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of vibrating the ear drum. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box (larynx), and the upper vocal tract– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the {{different parts of the}} speech apparatus, the airstream <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>manipulated</b> to produce different speech sounds.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} ability to quickly grow and the {{relative}} ease with which they <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>manipulated,</b> bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to bioengineer bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.|$|E
5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>manipulated</b> by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E

5|$|Weyard {{is governed}} by the mythological concept of the {{classical}} elements. All matter on Weyard consists of any combination of the four base elements: Venus, Mars, Mercury and Jupiter, or earth, fire, water, and wind, respectively. These four building blocks of reality <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>manipulated</b> by the omnipotent force of Alchemy, which reigned supreme in the world's ancient past. Alchemy was sealed away in the past, however, and {{the world in the}} present age has become seemingly devoid of this power. However, in various places throughout the world, people demonstrate an aptitude to manipulate one of the elements through a form of magic called Psynergy. These wielders of Psynergy, called Adepts, usually refrain from displaying their talents to outsiders.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} makes choices {{throughout}} the game, the gameplay's plot is revealed. Besides affecting dialogue and story developments, {{the outcome of}} entire scenes (and in some cases, the outcome of scenes several chapters later) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>manipulated</b> {{to a certain extent}} based on player choices. These choices are typically moral decisions made through Jodie's dialogue options, interventions with various characters, success or failure in her combat scenes, or psychic actions that the player chooses to have Aiden perform. Examples of choice-based outcomes are the chapter titled The Party, where the player is given the choice of unleashing brutal revenge toward a group of bullies or simply running away, and the chapter titled The Embassy, where the player can either engage in psychic information retrieval or can jeopardize the mission by forcing one of the guards to commit suicide. Choices also determine the finale of Beyond: Two Souls, as any number of possible plot endings can be experienced by the player.|$|E
5|$|Battles in {{the story}} take place on maps divided into a square-based grid. Battle actions are governed by a turn-based system where each unit on both sides is given their chance to move and act. During gameplay, weather and terrain effects appear such as fog of war or {{elements}} of the environment that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>manipulated</b> to one side's advantage, affecting the progress of battle. Units are split between player, enemy and allied non-player character (NPC) units. Each unit's movement range and attack range is displayed when selected. The player must clear a map to advance the story: the objectives for clearing a level can vary from defeating all enemies to capturing strongholds or rescuing NPCs. When engaging a unit, the scene transitions into a battle between the player and enemy unit, with battle animation playing out. When hit with an attack, a character loses health points (HP). For player characters, HP can be restored with items or by units with healing magic; {{it can also be}} regained by standing on forts, gates or castles, or using a special spell that replenishes health based on damage dealt to an enemy.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} Raziel, a disfigured and ghostly vampire. The game {{is normally}} shown from a third-person perspective behind Raziel, but players can rotate the viewpoint around him. Gameplay relies largely on shifting between {{the material and}} spectral planes of existence to progress through areas. Although interaction with objects is limited in the spectral realm, this can be advantageous, because Raziel can phase through otherwise impassable gates there, and water is insubstantial, allowing him to walk on lakebeds; however, blocks, doors, and switches <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>manipulated</b> only in the physical realm. Many puzzles {{are based on the}} differences between the two realms; for example, platforms and environment features in one realm may change form to open new paths in the other. Block puzzles are also common and require the rotation, flipping, and moving of large blocks to progress, often with a time limit and while avoiding enemies.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>manipulated</b> at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E
