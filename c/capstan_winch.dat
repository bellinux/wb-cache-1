50|$|Abandonment/Recovery {{system with}} double <b>capstan</b> <b>winch,</b> 2000 tonne {{capacity}} each.|$|E
50|$|A stage-level locking rail may be {{provided}} with an engaging bar for a portable <b>capstan</b> <b>winch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{military}} specification {{vehicles were}} usually equipped with 15-speed Fuller gearboxes and an 8-tonne <b>capstan</b> <b>winch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{with the}} aid of her steam <b>capstan</b> <b>winching</b> in the cable and 125 men pulling at her tow rope, the Skuzzy made it through Hell's Gate. It took 16 days to make the 16 mile trip to Boston Bar. The Skuzzy became the first sternwheeler to arrive in Lytton.|$|R
50|$|Pionierpanzer 3 Kodiak: A combat {{engineering}} vehicle {{conversion of}} the Leopard 2, the Kodiak is used by Swiss Army (SKodiak), and is on order for the Dutch army and Swedish army. While equipped with a bulldozer, excavator, and dual <b>capstan</b> <b>winches,</b> the Pionierpanzer 3 has no turret instead, a Remote Weapon Station is fitted. It rides on the Leopard 2 chassis with a built-up forward superstructure. The vehicle is used primarily for the clearance of obstacles (including minefields). The Dutch version will have additional bomblet protection for the crew compartments. Spain may procure 24 examples for the Spanish Army from converted Leopard 2A4 hulls. One vehicle has been trialled in Spain.|$|R
50|$|In the {{interest}} of making the carrick bend easier to untie, especially when tied in extremely large rope, the ends may be seized to prevent the knot from collapsing when load is applied. This practice also keeps the knot's profile flatter and can ease its passage over <b>capstans</b> or <b>winches.</b>|$|R
50|$|The use of {{block and}} tackle or <b>capstan</b> <b>winch</b> is common to handle line sets that have {{significantly}} unbalanced loads. Block and tackle sets use the mechanical advantage (e.g., 6 : 1) of multi-purchase blocks to enable a crew to manually raise an imbalanced line set. The standing block is secured at the grid level and the running block to the batten or arbor (whichever is overloaded). Where an engaging bar has been designed into the stage level locking rail, a portable electric <b>capstan</b> <b>winch</b> {{may be used to}} counteract an imbalanced counterweight line set. Pulling on (constricting) a rope wrapped a few times around the capstan, a drum spinning at a constant rate, generates enough traction (through friction) to tug the imbalanced load.|$|E
50|$|Some 101FCs were {{produced}} with a PTO powered Nokken <b>capstan</b> <b>winch</b> {{mounted on the}} chassis at {{the centre of the}} vehicle, allowing winching from either the front or rear. Another variation on a small number of pre-production vehicles was the addition of a trailer with an axle driven from the PTO, creating a 6x6 vehicle, this adaptation was abandoned before full production when it was discovered that the trailer had a propensity to push the vehicle onto its side when driven over rough terrain.|$|E
50|$|The Samson was {{conceived}} {{in the early}} 1970s with the final design entering production in 1978. The hull is an all-welded aluminium construction. It usually carries a crew of three operating a 3.5T <b>capstan</b> <b>winch</b> that can also be utilised in a lifting configuration. It carries suitable equipment to enable a 4:1 mechanical advantage with 228m of winch rope. This winch is capable of recovering up to 12 Tonnes of vehicle. A manually operated earth anchor is situated at the rear to anchor the vehicle while operations are carried out.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ship was}} {{designed}} for a normal speed of 16 knots, having refrigerated cargo capacity of , ventilated cargo capacity of [...] and general cargo capacity of [...] {{for a total of}} [...] with a crew of 95. Propulsion was by three in series Newport News impulse turbines delivering up to a continuous 7,500 shaft horsepower through reduction gears to a single screw of [...] diameter. Electricity for extensive use throughout the ship, including deck windlass, <b>capstans,</b> <b>winches</b> and watertight doors was supplied by three 250 kilowatt General Electric generator sets which also charged a storage battery bank for emergency power in case of main plant failure. Six cargo holds were served by cargo side ports for No. 3 and No. 4 with hatches for the balance with each of the two masts having four 5 ton booms and the foremast an additional 25 ton boom.|$|R
50|$|A {{version of}} the Valuk has been built with a rear ramp with an {{emergency}} door instead of two doors. The vehicle can also be equipped with a <b>capstan</b> type cable <b>winch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Two 150 {{kilowatt}} General Electric turbo-generator sets provided {{lighting and}} power for auxiliary machinery {{with a half}} kilowatt Holtzer-Cabot Electric Company generator providing power for wireless communication with an emergency lighting generator set driven by a gasoline engine on the upper deck. <b>Capstans</b> and <b>winches</b> were all electric including the windlass for the two bower anchors of 5,110 lb each. Steering gear, not electric, was steam driven as were various engineering pumps; main boiler feed pump, auxiliary feed, circulating and air pumps. Two eight ton refrigeration plants were installed forward.|$|R
5000|$|Steam Locomotives used on {{the line}} were mainly {{restricted}} to the lightweight U and Q class along with smaller tank locomotives such as Wa, Wf, F and D classes. The reason being the only turning facilities at Bluff was the [...] "Wye" [...] layout {{that was part of}} the wharf's lighter rail access bridges. Only the tank locomotives could use the wharf trackage and they were assisted by a <b>capstan</b> <b>winch</b> system that could pull wagons into position under ship's cranes, Bluff town wharf never having cranes. The small shunters would also assist with handling rakes of wagons to and from the Ocean Beach freezing works.|$|E
50|$|Although the Seine Boats {{were kept}} in the water for long periods during the Pilchard Season they were hauled out to a {{position}} above high water by a strong Winch when bad weather or storms approached. This would take place day or night. A capstan similar to that visible today in Mullion Cove was used but in the 19th century {{was surrounded by a}} strong wooden framework to assist winching. A <b>capstan</b> <b>winch</b> which has a similar but smaller framework and used for the same purpose, constructed by local miners from Geevor, is still in place today at the little cornish fishing cove of Penberth in the Parish of St. Buryan and can be visited there on foot from Porthcurno.|$|E
50|$|Since the CJ-2A was {{primarily}} intended for farming, ranching, and industrial applications, {{a wide variety}} of extras were available such as: rear seat, center rear-view mirror(Stock CJ-2As came with only a driver side mirror), front passenger seat (Stock CJ-2As only came with a driver seat), canvas top, front PTO, rear PTO, belt pulley drive, <b>capstan</b> <b>winch,</b> governor, rear hydraulic lift, snow plow, welder, generator, mower, disc, front bumper weight, heavy-duty springs, dual vacuum windshield wipers (stock CJ-2As were equipped with a manual wiper on the passenger side and a vacuum wiper on the driver side), dual taillights (Stock CJ-2As had a taillight on the driver side and a reflector on the passenger side), hot-climate radiator, driveshaft guards, heater, side steps, and radiator brush guard.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to examine the}} effects of varying the surface finish of a sailing <b>winch</b> <b>capstan</b> on the {{friction}} between the drum and a standard sailing rope. As a result a sailing winch was designed and manufactured with the aim of having drums which could be interchanged simply. The following four different winch drums were manufactured with varying surface patterns...|$|R
50|$|It is both {{ancient and}} modern {{practice}} for anchor <b>capstans</b> and jib <b>winches</b> to be slightly flared out at the base, rather than cylindrical, to prevent the rope (anchor warp or sail sheet) from sliding down. The rope wound several times around the winch can slip upwards gradually, with little risk of a riding turn, provided it is tailed (loose end is pulled clear), by hand or a self-tailer.|$|R
50|$|The bow {{can easily}} launch an arrow past the vessel, but {{unfortunately}} when even a light line is attached, the arrows fall far short. All is not lost, though, because another crew member manages {{to build a}} large box kite which succeeds in carrying a line to the ship on the first attempt. The men manage to use the light line to pull across successively stronger lines, until they have a heavy rope stretched between the island and the ship. The bo'sun attaches this to a conveniently located boulder while {{the crew of the}} ship attaches the line to the stump of a mast and uses a <b>capstan</b> to gradually <b>winch</b> the ship closer to the island.|$|R
50|$|The UK {{currently}} operates four {{variants of}} the vehicle: The Troop Carrying Variant (TCV) {{capable of carrying}} 2 crew plus 10 passengers; the Command Variant (CV), which carries 2 crew plus up to 8 passengers with the rear cab being designed as an enhanced digital communications platform, the Repair and Recovery Variant (RRV), carrying 4 specialist maintenance vehicle mechanic crewmen and the Ambulance Variant (AV). The rear cab of the RRV carries a HIAB crane, a full mobile workshop, an air compressor and a 9 tonne capacity <b>capstan</b> <b>winch,</b> together with hydraulic anchors. All three variants are fully air-portable under a CH-47 Chinook helicopter, either complete or in two separate front and rear component parts and are also fully amphibious; being capable of swimming in varying sea-states with a full load of passengers and stores.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of the vehicle was developed in competition by Marmon-Herrington and Ford Motor Company. Marmon-Herrington specialized in all-wheel drive vehicles. The Marmon-Herrington prototype's hull formed an integral unibody structure, created by cutting shapes out of steel sheet and welding those together. The Ford entry, however, used a sturdy chassis and internal frame, to which more or less regular automobile type sheet-steel was welded. This construction made the GPA some 400 lb lighter than its competitor. The GPA's design {{was based on the}} Willys MB and Ford GPW standard Jeeps as much as possible, using many of the same parts. The GPA had an interior {{similar to that of the}} MB/GPW jeeps, although the driver's compartment had almost twice as many control levers: 2WD/4WD, hi-range/lo-range, <b>capstan</b> <b>winch</b> (on the bows), propeller deployment and rudder control. After a direct comparison of the two company's prototypes, Ford received a contract for production starting in 1942.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{majority}} (67 %) of hospitalized injuries among Alaska {{commercial fishermen}} {{are associated with}} deck machinery. This paper describes the “Prevention Through Design ” process to mitigate one serious machinery entanglement hazard posed by a capstan deck winch. Methods: After observing that the <b>capstan</b> <b>winch</b> provides no entanglement protection and the hydraulic controls are usually {{out of reach of}} the entangled person, NIOSH personnel met with fishermen and winch manufacturers to discuss various design solutions to mitigate these hazards. Results: An emergency-stop (“e-stop”) system was developed that incorporated a momentary contact button that when pushed, switches a safety-relay that deenergize...|$|E
2500|$|In 1907, Captain Johnson {{was still}} in charge of Mount Royal. On the {{afternoon}} of July 6, [...] he was returning from Hazelton and was steaming through the Kitselas Canyon, when disaster struck. A strong wind pushed her into a large rock formation named Ringbolt Island, wedging her crosswise against the current. Luckily, she held while the passengers and crew scrambled to safety on the shore. Johnson assessed the situation and decided that Mount Royal could be saved and with ten crewmen, he returned aboard. He had decided {{that the best way}} to deal with this problem was to use the <b>capstan</b> to <b>winch</b> the sternwheeler back over Ringboat Island. This proved to be a disastrous decision. The king post broke and rammed through the bottom of Mount Royal and she buckled as the current washed over her, then she rolled upside down and broke into pieces. Although Johnson survived, six of the crewmen drowned, including the first officer. One of the four survivors was rescued by George Little, who would later become the founder of the town of Terrace. George and a companion spotted the wrecked hull as the wreckage floated past the community of Kitselas. Curious, they paddled out to it and saw a hand waving at them from a hole in hull. The survivor was Mount Royals chief engineer, Ben Maddigan, who was trapped in the bilge and filthy, but unhurt. After George Little chopped him out, Little commented that there must have been some air down there. The exhausted engineer replied, [...] "I don’t know about air, but there was one hell of a lot of water!" ...|$|R
40|$|The {{consumer}} market currently offers no options for a low-cost, personal ascending device. The {{purpose of this}} project is to propose a powered ascender, actuated by common power tool components and operating {{on the principle of}} a <b>capstan</b> <b>winch,</b> as a candidate to fill that void. The first objective was to design and construct a working prototype. The second was to explore the feasibility of manufacturing a low cost consumer version of the product. Safety, functionality, and cost drove the design process. The ascender was designed and built around the motor and gearbox from a Dewalt 36 v hammerdrill. Individual components were machined in undergraduate machine shops on the MIT campus and in the MIT Hobby Shop. Testing of the ascender was carried out using standard gym equipment and weights. The completed unit can lift 100 kg at 0. 4 meters per second with an overall efficiency of 8. 5 %. This result was 57 % lower than the predicted speed of 0. 7 meters per second with an expected 14. 7 % efficiency. Analysis revealed a design flaw which can account for most of the discrepancy in the predicted and observed performance and which can easily be remedied. Powered ascenders within the same speed and load range are sold for several thousand dollars, demonstrating the feasibility of a low cost powered ascender as a viable product. by Daniel P. Gillund.
