40|$|Metabolic {{transformations of}} {{malignant}} cells {{are essential to}} the development and progression of all cancers. The understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of cancer requires the establishment of the altered genetic/metabolic factors that {{are essential to the}} development, growth, and proliferation of the malignant cells. Recognition of this important relationship has resulted in a resurgence of interest in the intermediary metabolism of tumor cells. The role of molecular genetics and proteomics and the application of molecular technology in assessing altered cellular metabolism has become a major area of biomedical research. The contemporary generation of biomedical scientists is exceptionally well trained in all areas of molecular biology and molecular technology, which are now important tools to be applied to the regulation of <b>cellular</b> <b>intermediary</b> metabolism. Simultaneously, the didactic and methodological training associated with the principles and operation of metabolic pathways, enzymology, cellular enzyme activity, and associated biochemical implications has been diminished and often eliminated from the pre- and post-doctoral programs. Interpretations and conclusions of alterations in cellular enzyme activity and associated metabolic pathways based on genetic/proteomic changes can and will result in misrepresentation of important metabolic implications in malignancy and other diseases. It is essential that the genetic/proteomic studies be coupled to biochemical/metabolic cellular events to satisfy the axiom: "genetic transformations and proteomic alterations will have little relevancy to disease processes if the genetic/proteomic alterations are not manifested in altered and impaired cellular and metabolic function". The appropriate marriage of molecular genetics/proteomics with the regulation of <b>cellular</b> <b>intermediary</b> metabolism will provide new revelations and understanding of malignancy that could not be achieved in earlier generations...|$|E

Conversely to prokaryotes and inferior eukaryotes, a complete oxida-tion leading to CO 2 and H 2 O formation is mandatory. Our knowledge about oxi-dative phosphorylation is mostly based on simplified in vitro models, i. e., isolated mitochondria where only those parameters included in the experimental systems can be appreciated. However, relationships between mitochondria and the host cell are of major importance in the regulation of the pathway of ATP synthesis and oxygen consumption by the respiratory chain. By determining the respective rate of glucose or fatty acid oxidation, <b>cellular</b> <b>intermediary</b> metabolism affects the ratio between NADH and FADH 2, upstream of the Krebs cycle, thus affecting the yield ATP synthesis. The mechanism for translocating reducing equivalents across the mitochondrial inner membrane (the malate–aspartate and glycerol- 3 -phosphate–dihydroxyacetone phosphate shuttles) also plays an important role. Indeed, because of such characteristics of electron supply to the respiratory chain, oxidative phosphorylation activity also participates in the determination of the ratio of NADH to FADH 2 oxidation, by modulation of the protonmotive force. Be-sides the role of thermodynamic and kinetic constraints applied to the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, it now appears that the supramolecular organization of oxidative phosphorylation and of cellular energy circuits introduces new regu-latory factors of oxidative phosphorylation. 1. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{balance between}} the {{activities}} of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) is an important control point in tissue remodeling. Previous studies have demonstrated elevated expression of the MMPs collagenase and stromelysin- 1 by aged human diploid fibroblasts compared to early-passage cultures. We show here that aging cells display an altered response to transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF beta 1) that selectively affects MMP mRNA expression. In both young and old cells, phorbol myristoyl- 13 acetate (PMA) induced the expression of transcripts of collagenase, stromelysin- 1, gelatinase-B, TIMP- 1, and TIMP- 3. In young cells, TGF beta 1 reciprocally modulated PMA-induced MMP and TIMP gene expression leading to reduced levels of transcripts for the MMPs and augmented accumulation of TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 3 mRNAs. However, repressing effects of TGF beta 1 on collagenase, stromelysin- 1, and gelatinase-B RNA expression were not apparent in old cells, though induction of the TIMP genes was unimpaired. By electrophoretic mobility shift analysis the nuclear transcription factors AP 1 and serum response factor (SRF) showed reduced levels of DNA binding activities in old fibroblasts compared to young cells. A probe for the TGF beta-inhibitory element (TIE) gave equivalent levels of complexes with nuclear extracts from both types of cells, though of different mobilities. We conclude {{that the effects of}} TGF beta 1 on MMP and TIMP gene expression involve different <b>cellular</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> and suggest that altered composition or modification of TIE binding factors in aging cells may underlie the failure of TGF beta 1 -mediated transcription repression. This mechanism may contribute to elevated constitutive expression of MMPs in old cells and to the connective tissue deterioration that accompanies the aging process...|$|R

Our research shows that melanin synthesized by the fungal banana pathogen Mycosphaerella fijiensis acts as a virulence factor through the photogeneration of singlet molecular oxygen O 2 (1 Dg). Using analytical tools, including elemental analysis, ultraviolet/ infrared absorption spectrophometry and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, we characterized both pigment content in mycelia and secreted to the culture media as 1, 8 -dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) -melanin type compound. This is sole melanin-type in M. fijiensis. Isolated melanins irradiated with a Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm produced monomol light emission at 1270 nm, confirming generation of O 2 (1 Dg), a highly reactive oxygen specie (ROS) that causes cellular death by reacting with all <b>cellular</b> macromolecules. <b>Intermediary</b> polyketides accumulated in culture media by using tricyclazole and pyroquilon (two inhibitors of DHN-melanin synthesis) were identified by ESI-HPLC-MS/MS.

40|$|Objective: Alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) is a <b>cellular</b> <b>intermediary</b> {{metabolite}} of Krebs cycle, {{involved in}} energy metabolism, amino acid synthesis, and nitrogen transport. It is available over-the-counter and marketed as a nutritional supplement. There {{is a growing}} body of evidence to suggest that dietary α-KG has the potential to maintain cellular redox status and thus can protect various oxidative stress induced disease states. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the hepatoprotective role of α-KG in acetaminophen (APAP) induced toxicity in rats. Materials and Methods: Animals were divided into three groups of six animals each. Group I (Vehicle control) : Normal Saline, Group II (APAP) : A single intraperitoneal injection of 0. 6 g/kg, Group III (APAP + α-KG) : APAP as in Group II with α-KG treatment at a dose of 2 g/kg, orally for 5 days. Then the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) with oxidative stress markers including malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and histopathology were analyzed. Results: The results indicate that APAP caused significant elevations in ALT, AST, ALP, and MDA levels, while GSH, SOD, and CAT were significantly depleted while co-administration of α-KG showed a significant (P < 0. 05) reduction in the severity of these damages. Histologically, the liver showed inflammation and necrosis after APAP treatment, which were significantly restored with co-administration of α-KG. Conclusion: These results indicate the possible therapeutic potential of α-KG in protecting liver damage by APAP in rats...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} and histologic events in human skin after a single ultraviolet exposure are well documented; and both in vitro and in vivo studies have established immunologic and mutagenic effects of ultraviolet rays on cells. However, {{little is known}} about the ultraviolet damage/repair response at the level of gene induction. This study examines the genetic response in cultured human keratinocytes exposed to a single solar-simulated ultraviolet dose and harvested at 1, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours postirradiation for northern blot analysis using c-DNA probes to well studied stress related genes, heat shock protein 70 and ubiquitin; to a recently cloned gene associated with growth arrest and DNA damage (gadd 153); to c-myc and c-fos, two proto-oncogenes known to be associated with cell growth and differentiation; and to glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, known to be involved in <b>cellular</b> <b>intermediary</b> metabolism, gadd 153 and c-fos mRNA levels are increased early (1 - 4 hours) in keratinocytes, at a time when the cells appear indistinguishable from nonirradiated controls. At the same early time points, the c-myc mRNA level is decreased. Heat shock protein 70 and ubiquitin transcripts are detectable under basal conditions but are not increased by ultraviolet exposure; although at later time points (24 - 48 hours), when there is morphologic evidence of cell damage and downregulation of the otherwise constitutively expressed gene glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, their unchanged steady state levels of mRNA constitute relative over expression. Irradiation of cells with the same solar-simulated ultraviolet dose filtered to remove the shortest and most damaging wavelengths results in a similar pattern of early gene induction, even though cell growth and survival are unaffected. These data suggest that two classes of genes participate in the response to ultraviolet rays: early genes whose mRNA levels are increased (gadd 153, c-fos) or decreased (c-myc) before or independent of any morphologic evidence of cell damage and late genes that are relatively increased (heat shock protein 70, ubiquitin) or decreased (glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase) in expression when morphologic cell damage is present. The early events may be a direct response to ultraviolet irradiation, whereas the late events may represent a secondary response to stress. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{wide variety}} of soluble {{signaling}} substances utilize the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway to regulate <b>cellular</b> behaviors including <b>intermediary</b> metabolism, ion channel conductivity, and transcription. A growing literature suggests that integrin-mediated cell adhesion may also utilize PKA to modulate adhesion-associated events such as actin cytoskeletal dynamics and migration. PKA is dynamically regulated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM). Furthermore, while some hallmarks of cell migration and cytoskeletal organization require PKA activity (e. g. activation of Rac and Cdc 42; actin filament assembly), others are inhibited by it (e. g. activation of Rho and PAK; interaction of VASP with the c-Abl tyrosine kinase). Also, cell migration and invasion can be impeded by either inhibition or hyper-activation of PKA. Finally, a number of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) serve to associate PKA with various components of the actin cytoskeleton, thereby enhancing and/or specifying cAMP/PKA signaling in those regions. This review discusses the growing literature that supports the hypothesis that PKA plays {{a central role in}} cytoskeletal regulation and cell migration...|$|R
40|$|Vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (VISA) is {{generated}} from vancomycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus by multiple spontaneous mutations. We previously reported that sequential acquisition of mutations in the two-component regulatory systems vraSR and graRS {{was responsible for}} the VISA phenotype of strain Mu 50. Here we report on the identification of a novel set of regulator mutations, a deletion mutation in two-component regulatory system walRK (synonyms, vicRK and yycFG), and a truncating mutation in a proteolytic regulatory gene, clpP, responsible for the raised vancomycin resistance in a laboratory-derived VISA strain, LR 5 P 1 -V 3. The contributory effect of the two mutations to vancomycin resistance was confirmed by introducing the walK and clpP mutations into the vancomycin-susceptible parent strain N 315 LR 5 P 1 by a gene replacement procedure. The vancomycin MIC of N 315 LR 5 P 1 was raised from 1 to 2 mg/liter by the introduction of the walK or clpP mutation, but it was raised to 4 mg/liter by the introduction of both the walK and clpP mutations. The vancomycin MIC value of the double mutant was equivalent to that of strain LR 5 P 1 -V 3. Like VISA clinical strains, LR 5 P 1 -V 3 and the double mutant strain LR 5 P 1 walK*clpP* exhibited a thickened cell wall, slow growth, and decreased autolytic activity. Transcriptional profiles of the mutants with gene replacements demonstrated that introduction of both the walK and clpP mutations could alter expression of dozens or hundreds of genes, including those involved in cell envelope and <b>cellular</b> processes, <b>intermediary</b> metabolism, and information pathway. A mutation prevalence study performed on 39 worldwide clinical VISA strains showed that 61. 5, 7. 7, 10. 3, and 20. 5 % of VISA strains harbored mutations in walRK, clpP, graRS, and vraSR, respectively. The mutation of walRK was most frequently carried by VISA strains. Together, these results suggested that the mutations of walK and clpP identified in LR 5 P 1 -V 3 constitute a new combination of genetic events causing vancomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus...|$|R
40|$|The {{differences}} and similarities between aquatic and terresfial mammals {{have been the}} subjects of several investigations (1 - 3). Studies of the gross and hlstologic anatomy of the lungs of several marine mammals have disclosed some structural modifications peculiar to these species (4, 5). The problems of adaptation of physical structure to an aquatic environment have been discussed by Kellogg (6) and the physiology of respiration of diving animals has been reviewed by Irving (7). The mechanisms for controlling the oxygen supply to the tissues {{and the ability of}} many marine mammals to undergo long periods of submergence have been of great interest. Irving, Scholander, and Grinnell (8) studied the respiration of dolphins during rest and diving and found that the resting oxygen consumption was less than that for seals but somewhat greater than for man per unit of weight. They reported that the lactic acid content of the muscle tissue of dolphins did not change significantly during the dive and that blood lactate values were not altered during or after diving, in contrast to the results obtained on rats and ducks (9) and on seals (8) in which lactic acid increased in the muscle during diving and in the blood during recovery. With some information on the over-all physiology of the dolphin at hand, it was of interest to study the <b>intermediary</b> <b>cellular</b> metabolism, since fundamental differences in the metabolism of aquatic and terrestial mammals must certainly reflect variations in enzymatic processes.

40|$|The {{phytohormone}} {{abscisic acid}} (ABA) is an endogenous messenger in plant abiotic stress responses. Drought stress increases {{the level of}} ABA triggering the fastest adaptive physiological response of plants- closure of stomata, individual pores surrounded by two guard cells {{on the surface of}} leaves. Understanding gene/protein expression involved in stomatal closure has great importance to genetic modification of plants to survive under severe climatic conditions. However, systems level information that defines the communication pattern of the related network of cellular molecules is not yet properly understood. Stomatal closure, in broad terms, is a combined result of organic and inorganic ion regulation to release water from the guard cells through osmosis (reduction of turgor) and the rearrangement of the cell structure to facilitate stomatal movement. This study integrated fragmentary information collected from the literature to define the dynamics of ABA signalling in the rapid closure of stomata through three computational approaches (synchronous Boolean, asynchronous Boolean and normalized HillCube models). Our network consists of 56 nodes and their interaction dynamics (127 interactions) defined in accordance with the past experimental results. In our network, the input node represents the ABA signal to the system. Intermediary nodes represent proteins, second messengers, small molecules, plant lipids and several <b>cellular</b> conditions. These <b>intermediary</b> nodes link the system signal to the global cellular response (stomatal closure) through a series of interconnected network edges (reactions), predominantly representing enzyme catalysis, various post-translational modification activities and ion transport. The first main task was to update and extend the existing ABA network, with the addition of 22 elements and 84 reactions. After completing the network topology with the available biological knowledge, we then studied the topological properties of the ABA signalling network and found that the network displays scale-free properties with RbOH, SLAC 1, Ca²⁺, PP 2 C, PA, Depolarization and Actin as network hubs to define the functional modules of the system. The first modelling attempt in this study was to check the system dynamics of the ABA signalling system with a synchronous Boolean model and compare the model results with the current mathematical model available in the literature. Our model resulted rapid stomatal closure with in several arbitrary time steps and then converged the system dynamics to eight limit cycle attractors. These eight attractors represented the synchronous steady state dynamics of the ABA signalling system and provided the evidence for experimentally observed Ca²⁺ oscillations in the guard cells. We found that the advancement of network topology improved the understanding of network functioning while preserving the core behaviour observed in the Li et al. (2006) ᵇ model. The study was mainly conducted to identify the essential components of ABA signalling as the most important regulators of the system were decided by the topology. The results revealed that destruction of the ABA receptor complex (PYR/PYL, PP 2 C and SnRK 2 proteins) made the stomata insensitive to closure {{as the result of a}} disruption of signal transmission to downstream regulators. It was identified that the plasma membrane outward ion channels, GORK and SLAC 1, are crucial for pumping out water to facilitate guard cell turgor reduction. Inhibition of MAPK kinases (an important regulator of SLAC 1), cytosolic alkalization (pH) and membrane depolarization also had a drastic effect on stomatal closure. Loss of the function of actin rearrangement resulted in loss of stomatal closure as structural rearrangements of the guard cells are necessary to facilitate cell shrinkage. Disruption of reactive oxygen species or their regulators (RBOH, PA, PLD or RCN 1), plant-specific actin binding protein SCAB 1 and overexpression of AtRAC 1 showed drastic effects on structural rearrangements. Perturbation analysis revealed that the number of elements crucial to stomatal closure comprised about 30 % of the network and, thus, stomatal closure was robust against perturbation to the other 70 % of network elements. These results were in agreement with experimental findings and indicated a potential redundancy and/or the secondary role of a large percentage of elements with respect to stomatal closure. The second major modelling attempt was to incorporate time delays into the network updating method to study the steady state dynamics of the ABA signalling network through an asynchronous Boolean model. The study was mainly conducted to identify the biologically reliable dynamics of ABA signalling system as the synchronous Boolean model lacks the temporal order of state transitions in the system. Results of this study revealed that the model successfully captured the temporal hierarchy of ABA signalling events, as observed in the experimental literature. The system achieved the stomatal closure within five minutes at the earliest and reached limit cycle attractors during steady state dynamics. Biologicaly most reliable attractor identified by the model resembled experimentally-observed oscillatory behaviour of Ca²⁺ with the measured frequency and transient periods. The model explained that the attractor was a result of the regulatory activities of 14 non-stationary nodes (defined by Ca²⁺) and the frozen states of the remainder of the network nodes. Evaluation of the role of Ca²⁺ in the ABA signalling network found that redundancy of [Ca²⁺]cyt signalling within the ABA signalling system during stomatal closure played a large role in protecting the system against various disturbances and accelerating stomatal closure by the fast regulation of SLAC 1 channel. Our model further predicted that if ABA enhance the sensitivity of the network regulatory proteins to [Ca²⁺]cyt, ABA can hand over the system regulation to [Ca²⁺]cyt under the condition that [Ca²⁺]cyt can independently regulate the enzyme, PLC. This finding corresponded with the biological hypothesis in the literature that ABA enhances the Ca²⁺sensitivity of some proteins. The third modelling attempt of the research was to identify the minimal model to represent steady state dynamics of the system and model it with continuous dynamics using the normalized HillCube approach to better understand the properties of the system. The transformation of the Boolean dynamics of the core model (consisting of attractor nodes) into continuous dynamics successfully reproduced the limit cycle attractor of the ABA signalling system with defined parameters, such as 10 minute transient periods and the peak height of Ca²⁺ oscillations equals to 400 - 600 nM. The model found that the ABA system oscillations were sensitive to small changes in the regulation of Ca²⁺ efflux systems. It further revealed that the system attractor has the potential to decode the Ca²⁺ signature to achieve steady state regulation of downstream effectors through Ca²⁺ sensor proteins, which could be important and probably used for the maintenance of stomatal closure. The model was able to predict the kinetic parameters for downstream regulations of CDPK to achieve their steady state regulation for maintenance of stomatal closure...|$|R
