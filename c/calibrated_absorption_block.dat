40|$|Nitrous acid, HONO, is a {{significant}} source of atmospheric HOx and the production of HONO may be responsible for the recycling of deposited NOy back into the atmosphere in active form. Many current techniques rely on wet-chemical extractive methods, but are potentially prone to interferences and have not always shown good agreement with optical techniques 1. Spectroscopy offers an alternative method with greater specificity, however, the rotational-vibrational transitions of HONO in the mid-infrared region are not well studied. We present results from an experiment using a new tunable continuouswave quantum cascade laser absorption spectrometer. We measured the cis-HONO spectra between 1659 and 1660 cm- 1 and the trans-HONO spectra near 1275 cm− 1 (both at a resolution of about 0. 001 cm− 1). Absolute mixing ratios of total HONO were determined by catalytic conversion to NO followed by <b>calibrated</b> <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy. The effective line-strengths for cis-HONO near 1660 cm− 1 were about a factor of 2. 5 smaller than those listed in the ATMOS database, but line-strengths for trans-HONO around 1275 cm− 1 agreed well with reported values...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{trace element}} copper (Cu) is a {{cofactor}} for biochemical functions ranging from energy generation to iron (Fe) acquisition, angiogenesis, and free radical detoxification. While Cu {{is essential for}} life, the molecules that mediate dietary Cu uptake have not been identified. Ctr 1 is a homotrimeric protein, conserved from yeast to humans, that transports Cu across the plasma membrane with high affinity and specificity. Here we describe the generation of intestinal epithelial cell-specific Ctr 1 knockout mice. These mice exhibit striking neonatal defects in Cu accumulation in peripheral tissues, hepatic Fe overload, cardiac hypertrophy, and severe growth and viability defects. Consistent with an intestinal Cu <b>absorption</b> <b>block,</b> the growth and viability defects can be partially rescued by a single postnatal Cu administration, indicative of a critical neonatal metabolic requirement for Cu that is provided by intestinal Ctr 1.

The experiments were performed using the high energy X-ray source available at the Museum Research Laboratory of the Getty Conservation Institute, Los Angeles (GCI) and the experimental setup developed through by a collaboration between the GCI and the University of Bologna. By changing the distance between the sample, the GOS screen, and camera the setup makes it possible to optimize the resolution of the measured images even for large objects.

Two of fifteen antibodies examined (20 - 8 - 4, anti-Kb,Kd,r,s and 34 - 1 - 2, antiKd,Dd,Kb,r,s,q,p) were observed to detect an antigen determined by gene(s) mapping {{to the right of}} H- 2 D.

Thus, these data demonstrate serological cross-reactivity between a Class I MHC antigen and a differentiation antigen determined by genes linked to H- 2. It seems likely that the gene responsible for this new antigen is one of the numerous Class I-like sequences detected by DNA hybridization analyses, but previously undefined in terms of tissue expression.

H 2 O and CO 2 contents in experimental glasses {{were determined by}} bulk analytical methods and FTIR spectroscopy. For the quantification of volatile concentrations by IR spectroscopy we have <b>calibrated</b> the <b>absorption</b> coefficients of water-related and carbon-related bands for phono-tephritic compositions. The determined absorption coefficients are 0. 62 ± 0. 06 L mol- 1 cm- 1 for the band at ~ 4500 cm- 1 (OH groups) and 1. 02 ± 0. 03 L mol- 1 cm- 1 for the band at ~ 5200 cm- 1 (H 2 O molecules). The coefficient for the fundamental OH stretching vibration at 3550 cm- 1 is 63. 9 ± 5. 4 L mol- 1 cm- 1. CO 2 is bound in the phono-tephritic glass as CO 32 - exclusively; its concentration was quantified by the peak height of the doublet near the 1500 cm- 1 band with the <b>calibrated</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient of 308 ± 110 L mol- 1 cm- 1. Quench crystals were observed in glasses with water contents exceeding 6 wt% even when using a rapid quench device, limiting the application of IR spectroscopy for water-rich glasses. H 2 O solubility in the ultrapotassic melts (7. 52 wt% K 2 O) {{as a function of}} pressure is similar to the solubility in basaltic melts up to 400 MPa (~ 8 wt%) but is higher at 500 MPa (up to 10. 71 wt%). At 500 MPa and 1200 °C, the CO 2 capacity of the phono-tephritic melt is about 0. 82 wt%. The high CO 2 capacity is probably related to the high K 2 O content of the melt. At both 200 and 500 MPa, the H 2 O solubility shows a non linear dependence on XfH 2 O in the whole XfH 2 O range. The variation of CO 2 solubility with XfCO 2 displays a pronounced convex shape in particular at 500 MPa, implying that dissolved H 2 O promotes the solubility of CO 2. Our experimental data on CO 2 solubility indicate that the interaction between phono-tephritic magma and carbonate rocks occurring in the Alban Hills magmatic system may result in partial dissolution of CO 2 from limestone into the magma. However, although the CO 2 solubility in phono-tephritic melts is relatively high compared to that in silicic to basaltic melts, the capacity for assimilation of limestone without degassing is nevertheless limited to < 1 wt% at the P-T conditions of the magma chamber below Alban Hills...|$|R

40|$|Membranoproliferative nephritis in {{children}} is frequently {{associated with a}} hypocomplementemia produced {{at least in part}} by C 3 breakdown mediated by a circulating anticomplementary factor known as C 3 nephritic factor (C 3 NeF). C 3 breakdown by this factor in vitro requires the presence of a pseudoglobulin cofactor and magnesium. The present study provides evidence that properdin factor B (C 3 proactivator) is activated in the nephritic factor reaction and is the direct mediator of C 3 breakdown by C 3 NeF. Depletion of factor B from mixtures of normal human serum (NHS) and plasma from a patient with membranoproliferative nephritis (MPP), either by heating or by immune equivalence <b>absorption,</b> <b>blocks</b> C 3 breakdown by C 3 NeF. Addition of purified factor B to these mixtures restores the anticomplementary effect. When purified factor B is added to mixtures of MPP and purified C 3, breakdown also occurs. Associated with the C 3 breakdown is a change in the electrophoretic mobility of factor B from the beta to the gamma position, a shift which has been associated with cleavage activation of the molecule. Further, serum factor B levels are often low in patients with membranoproliferative nephritis and bear a rough inverse correlation with C 3 NeF levels. It thus appears that factor B is the previously described heat-labile C 3 NeF cofactor. Whether the C 3 NeF reaction proceeds via a pathway comparable to that activated by the cobra venom factor or via that activated by zymosan or inulin cannot be determined from the present data...|$|R
40|$|The low {{frequency}} radio emission of starburst galaxies is informative, {{but it can}} be absorbed in several ways. Most importantly, starburst galaxies are home to many H II regions, whose free-free <b>absorption</b> <b>blocks</b> {{low frequency}} radio waves. These H II regions are discrete objects, but most multiwavelength models of starbursts assume a uniform medium of ionized gas, if they include the absorption at all. I calculate the effective absorption coefficient of H II regions in starbursts, which is ultimately a cross section times the density of H II regions. The cross sections are calculated by assuming that H II regions are Strömgren spheres. The coefficient asymptotes to a constant value at low frequencies, because H II regions partially cover the starburst, and are buried part way into the starburst's synchrotron emitting material. Considering Strömgren spheres around either OB stars or Super Star Clusters, I demonstrate the method by fitting to the low frequency radio spectrum of M 82. I discuss implications of the results for synchrotron spectrum shape, H II region pressure, and free-free emission as a star-formation rate indicator. However, these results are preliminary, and could be affected by systematics. I argue that there is no volume-filling warm ionized medium in starbursts, and that H II regions {{may be the most important}} absorption process down to 10 MHz. Future data at low and high radio frequency will improve our knowledge of the ionized gas. Comment: Accepted by MNRAS, 26 pages, 10 figures. See note added in proof to correct for error in IMF.

The spectrum exhibits bright emission lines of the H- and He-like ions of Ne, Mg, Si and S, as well as Fe XVIII to Fe XX and Fe XXV lines. Line fluxes have been measured. The RGS and e pi c spectra have been simultaneously fitted to obtain self-consistent temperatures, emission measures, and elemental abundances. Strong absorption by the dense WR stellar wind and the interstellar medium (ISM) is observed equivalent to N-H = 7 x 10 (21) cm(- 2). Multi-temperature (DEM) fitting yields two dominant components around temperatures of 7. 0 and 32 MK, respectively. The XMM intrinsic (i. e. unabsorbed, corrected for the stellar wind absorption and the absorption of ISM) X-ray luminosity of WR 25 is L-x(0. 5 - 10 keV) = 1. 3 x 10 (34) erg s(- 1), and L-x(0. 5 - 10 keV) = 0. 85 x 10 (34) erg s(- 1), (when correcting for the ISM only) assuming d = 3. 24 kpc. The obtained chemical abundances are subsolar, except for S. This may be real, but could equally well be due to a weak coupling to the continuum, which is strongly influenced by the absorption column density and the subtracted background.

Studies have also shown that there are some key beliefs by farmworkers that may exacerbate pesticide exposure, including the belief that “pesticides must be felt, seen, tasted, or smelled to be present; the skin <b>blocks</b> <b>absorption</b> and body openings facilitate it; exposure occurs only when a pesticide is wet;…and acute, not low-level chronic exposure is the primary danger.” ...|$|R
