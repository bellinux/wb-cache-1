25|$|Following dredging, {{in areas}} of the canal where {{contamination}} has permeated the underlying sediment, EPA will cap with multiple layers of <b>clean</b> <b>material.</b> The multi-layer cap consists of an “active” layer made of a specific type of clay that will remove contamination that could well up from below, an “isolation” layer of sand and gravel that will ensure that the contaminants are not exposed, and an “armor” layer of heavier gravel and stone to prevent erosion of the underlying layers from boat traffic and canal currents. Finally, sufficient clean sand will be placed on top of the “armor” layer to fill in the voids between the stones and to establish sufficient depth in order to restore the canal bottom as a habitat. In the middle and upper segment of the canal where the native sediment is contaminated with liquid coal tar, the EPA will stabilize that sediment by mixing it with concrete or similar materials. The stabilized areas will then be covered with the multiple layer cap as described above.|$|E

While conceptual design work with the Hemingways continued apace, the considerable challenges of achieving a workable remediation scheme were tackled by AIG and Arup in negotiation with the Environment Agency. The central question was whether residential development could take place without removal {{of all of the}} underlying contaminated material. After much investigation and testing of the existing ground, a remediation scheme was prepared which removed the isolated hotspots of contamination and cut off pathways from the remaining lower level contamination to the surface and adjoining river, involving a further regrading and capping exercise using <b>clean</b> <b>material</b> imported into the site.|$|E

50|$|The main subprocesses of sensor-based sorting are {{material}} conditioning, material presentation, detection, {{data processing}} and separation. Material conditioning includes all operations which prepare the particles for being detected by the sensor. All optical sensors need <b>clean</b> <b>material</b> {{to be able}} to detect optical characteristics. Conditioning includes screening and cleaning of the feed material. The aim of the material presentation is the isolation of the particles by creating a single particle layer with the densest surface cover possible without particles touching each other and enough distance to each other allowing for a selective detection and rejection of each single particle. There are two types of sensor-based sorters: the chute type and the belt type. For both types the first step in acceleration is spreading out the particles by a vibrating feeder followed by either a fast belt or a chute. On the belt type the sensor usually detects the particles horizontally while they pass it on the belt. For the chute type the material detection is usually done vertically while the material passes the sensor in a free fall. The data processing is done in real time by a computer. The computer transfers the result of the data processing to an ultra fast ejection unit which, depending on the sorting decision, ejects a particle or lets it pass.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Dredged {{material}} and in situ sediments may contain contaminants at sufficient concentrations to degrade the benthic environment. In cases where unacceptable toxicity or bioaccumulation {{is predicted to}} occur, subaqueous capping {{with a layer of}} <b>clean</b> <b>material</b> is often an acceptable management or remediation alternative. This technical note (TN) describes equipment and placement techniques for subaqueous capping projects. The equipment and techniques are applicable to placement of contaminated material to be capped and <b>clean</b> <b>material</b> to be used for capping and include conventional discharge from barges, hopper dredges, and pipelines; submerged discharge from diffusers and tremies; and surface spreading techniques for cap placement. Both granular capping materials such as sediments and soils and geosynthetic fabrics and armoring materials are considered. BACKGROUND: Detailed guidance on engineering considerations for dredged material capping and in situ sediment capping can be found in Palermo et al. (1998 a, 1998 b). These guidance documents include information on equipment and placement techniques used in projects up to about 1994.

40|$|PURPOSE: When dredged {{material}} {{has been determined}} to contain contaminants that open-water placement would potentially cause to degrade the benthic environment, subaqueous capping {{with a layer of}} <b>clean</b> <b>material</b> may provide an acceptable management alternative. Subaqueous capping of in situ contaminated sediments also represents a potentially effective remediation option. For either practice to satisfy the requirement of isolation of the contaminated sediments, design of caps of <b>clean</b> <b>material</b> must account for multiple factors affecting the long-term stability of the cap. The purpose of this technical note is to present guidance on one of these factors, bioturbation, which consists of various processes whereby organisms modify sediment properties or move sediment particles or solutes within the sediment matrix. Specifically, this technical note focuses on estimation of bioturbation profiles, depths, and process rates in relation to subaqueous cap design. BACKGROUND: Detailed guidance on engineering considerations for {{dredged material}} capping and in situ sediment capping can be found in Palermo et al. (1998 a, 1998 b).

30|$|HY-TUF {{steel is}} a {{specific}} class of low-alloy medium-carbon steel that derives its strength from martensitic transformation and precipitation of carbides in a quenched and tempered condition. In HY-TUF steel, compared to other low-alloy medium-carbon steels (such as AISI 4340 steel), C content is maintained at a low level (< 0.26  wt%); the contents of Si and Mn are relatively high (~ 3  wt%), as well as Ni (~ 1.80  wt%). This design of the composition is considered for HY-TUF steel to get superior toughness and resistance to crack propagation as well as ultra-high strength.
