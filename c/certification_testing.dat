5|$|At {{the time}} it was not {{mandatory}} to flight test new variants of existing engines, and <b>certification</b> <b>testing</b> failed to reveal vibration modes that the fan experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the fan was being subjected to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the fan blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000lbf (98kN) from 23,500lbf (105kN). The redesigned fan blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of wind power in Denmark {{has been characterized}} by a close collaboration between publicly financed research and industry in key areas such as research and development, <b>certification,</b> <b>testing,</b> and the preparation of standards. For example, in the 1980s, {{a large number of}} small Danish companies were developing wind turbines to sell to California, and the Danish Risø laboratory provided test facilities and certification procedures. These resulted in reliable products and the rapid expansion of the Danish turbine manufacturing industry. Components are tested at LORC in Odense, and new large prototype turbines between 4-8 MW (including some non-Danish ones) are being tested at Østerild. Limited production turbines (four Siemens 7MW with 66kV cabling) are to be supported at Nissum Bredning at a cost of DKK 300m, partially financed by local people.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Database {{replication}} protocols {{have historically}} been built on top of distributed database systems, and have consequently been designed and implemented using distributed transactional mechanisms, such as atomic commitment. We present the Database State Machine approach, {{a new way to}} deal with database replication in a cluster of servers. This approach relies on a powerful atomic broadcast primitive to propagate transactions between database servers, and alleviates the need for atomic commitment. Transaction commit is based on a <b>certification</b> <b>test,</b> and abort rate is reduced by the reordering <b>certification</b> <b>test.</b> The approach is evaluated using a detailed simulation model that shows the scalability of the system and the benefits of the reordering <b>certification</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pesticides {{can often}} be toxic {{and for this reason}} their methods and {{quantities}} of application are extremely regulated. Pesticide applicators are at risk of permanently damaging their health from exposure to pesticides. In order to ensure that these employees have the proper information to protect themselves, they are required to pass a state <b>certification</b> <b>test.</b> Agriculture, in certain states, relies on a high number of immigrant workers having varying degrees of education, thus making it difficult to efficiently and effectively train each employee in the needed areas. A computer-based training program for pesticide applicators was developed to be used by agricultural workers preparing for the state certification exam. The training program was designed to be effective for people with varying degrees of knowledge and computer experience. Similarly, its design has allowed for a method of training employees in their native tongue. Agricultural workers from a vineyard completed the computer-based training, in their native language of Mexican Spanish, prior to taking the state <b>certification</b> <b>test.</b> Nine of the sixteen workers passed the training program while none of them passed the state <b>certification</b> <b>test.</b> One participant did not complete either portion of the study, and one participant took the training but 2 did not take the <b>certification</b> <b>test.</b> Although none of the participants passed the <b>certification</b> <b>test</b> there was {{a significant increase in the}} training program scores between the pre-test and post-test.

The outcome of the training and state tests indicates a need to revise the content of the Pesticide Applicator training to better fit the information required for the <b>certification</b> <b>test</b> and account for the institutional bias that is inherent in the testing system.
