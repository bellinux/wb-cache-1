40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} intransitivity, as measured by the total <b>circular</b> <b>triad</b> (TCT) score in the method of paired comparisons, varies across different domains of content and across different groups of subjects. Three paired comparisons instru-ments were administered to 276 high school students and to 358 col-lege students. Results indicated statistically significant (p &le;. 001) correlations among the three TCT indices for both groups of sub-jects. EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT 1975, 35, 865 - 868. THE method of paired comparisons, one application of Thurstone’s (1927) &dquo;law of comparative judgment,&dquo; can be used to obtain pref-erences for a set of stimulus objects. In addition, the method yields an index of response intransitivity which has been termed the &dquo;total cir-cular triad&dquo; score. One of the aspects of the total <b>circular</b> <b>triad</b> score which has been questioned concerns the generality of response intransitivity as measured by the total <b>circular</b> <b>triad</b> score. Does intransitivity occur across instruments or is intransitivity instrument specific? Do relationships among intransitivity indices for one group of subjects replicate for other groups of subjects? Although previous investigations (Gulliksen, 1964; Ace and Dawis, 1972) have obtained intransitivity indices for more than one instru-ment, the generality of intransitivity across subject groups has not been established. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the generality of intransitivity across widely different domains of con-tent and across different groups of subjects...|$|E
40|$|Intransitivity {{associated}} with the method of paired comparisons for scaling stimulus objects has been hypothesized in previous research {{to relate to the}} psychological and/or physical distance between stimulus objects. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine whether paired-comparisons intransitivity is a function of intransitivity {{associated with}} specific stimulus objects rather than a function of the entire set of stimulus objects. Three 190 -item, paired-comparisons instruments with diverse content (i. e., vocational needs, mate preferences, and food preferences) were designed to examine the relationship between Stimulus Circular Triads and the Total <b>Circular</b> <b>Triad</b> score and were administered to 276 high school and 358 college students. Results of univariate correlational analyses and multiple-regression techniques suggested that paired-comparisons intransitivity relates to individual differences variables {{associated with the}} respondent, although there were differences in the absolute level of intransitivity associated with each of the three sets of stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{games and}} {{simulations}} are receiving considerable notice within the Library and Information Science (LIS) community. This study {{adds to the}} depth of knowledge in this area by providing research on the likelihood a hypothetical digital game delivery method for library instruction achieves sufficient adoption to justify its development. Furthermore, this knowledge will assist decision making processes for individuals debating the current or potential role of digital gaming at their institutions. In this mixed methods study, over 300 undergraduates were surveyed about their technology preferences, including digital gaming, for delivery of two forms of academic library instruction. The two forms of library instruction were (a) providing users with spatial information on physical library layout, and (b) educating users on information literacy topics and skills. Observational data was collected during the survey sessions, occurring at face-to-face library instruction sessions. Self-selected survey participants were also interviewed to further probe their survey responses. Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations was the theoretical foundation to this research. The primary innovation of study was the digital game delivery method. Detailed analysis of the survey-based data set included three nonparametric scaling methods: 1) rank-sum scaling; 2) <b>circular</b> <b>triad</b> analysis; and 3) multidimensional preference mapping. Content analysis of the observations and semi-structured interviews also occurred. Major outcomes were 1) the digital game delivery method achieved mediocre preference across both questions; 2) the audiovisual delivery method received the highest overall preference ranking; and 3) overall preference for the audio-only delivery method was remarkably low. The most important theme across the observational data was the participants' waning attention during the face-to-face library instruction sessions. The most important outcome from the semi-structured interviews was interviewees' stated appreciation for useful technologies. Over 95 % of participants were so-called digital natives, that is, born post- 1980. Rogers' assertion that age plays a minor role in predicting technology adoption appears warranted, since the more innovative digital game delivery method achieved mediocre overall preference...|$|E

Microfiche. vii, 177 leaves 28 cmThis work is {{concerned}} with the probability distributions of <b>circular</b> <b>triads</b> and the application of knowledge of these distributions to the study of behavior. Several approximations to distributions {{of the total number of}} <b>circular</b> <b>triads</b> produced by one judge are compared. Formulas for the means and variances of the distributions of <b>circular</b> <b>triads</b> for one object, across judges, are also derived. A computer program written to perform object: and subject scaling based upon <b>circular</b> <b>triads</b> is applied to four kinds of data. Analysis summaries of the results of scaling random data, social desirability word data, alphabetic visual similarity data, and Edwards Personal Preference Schedule data are produced. Research is restricted to the study of complete paired comparisons situations...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the extent to which the classical properties of social dominance describe the pattern of feeder-related displacements with groups of cattle. We also compared the advantages and disadvantages of three dominance indices for describing the competitive success at the feeder. We observed displacements at the feeder within six groups of 12 lactating dairy cows over 72 h per group. We demonstrated that the cattle in our experiment established a quasi-linear hierarchy at the feeder where many dominance relationships were bi-directional (52. 0 +/- 5. 9 %); namely, dominance relationships were significantly linear (P < 0. 05 in five of the six groups) but contained many <b>circular</b> <b>triads</b> (45. 0 +/- 5. 6 %). Dominance rank influenced the milk production (r = 0. 36, P = 0. 002) and the time budget of the animals: high-ranking cows were found spending more time at the feeder during the 120 min following provision of fresh food than low-ranking cows (P = 0. 022), but dominance indices based on the occurrence of displacements at the feeder did not correlate with actual time spent at the feeder. The presence of numerous <b>circular</b> <b>triads</b> and bi-directional relationships suggests that the classical properties of social dominance do not correspond to the pattern of displacements that occur at feeders within small groups of cattle. Instead, the competitive success may also be affected by motivation or persistence by the animal to gain access to the food resource...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{pairwise}} comparison matrix in the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which was proposed by Saaty in 1970 s, consists of elements expressed on a numerical scale. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to propose a consistency test for ordinality of items in the {{pairwise comparison}} matrix. The original of this test is in a sensory test. In a sensory test we use a pick-the-winner ordinal scale to obtain the table of preferences for objects. In 1940 Kendall and Babington Smith proposed a consistency test for the preference table, using the number of <b>circular</b> <b>triads</b> in it. In this paper we show how to apply their test to a pairwise comparison matrix in the binary AHP and to one without a tie for up to nine items in the AHP. This is to test, using a pairwise comparison matrix, whether or not we can accept that items which are factors or alternatives are sufficiently ranked linearly before calculating weights of these items...|$|R
