40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} the question: What are the {{criteria}} that an adequate theory of computation has to meet? 1. Smith's answer: it has to meet the empirical <b>criterion</b> (i. <b>e.</b> doing justice to computational practice), the conceptual <b>criterion</b> (i. <b>e.</b> explaining all the underlying concepts) and the cognitive <b>criterion</b> (i. <b>e.</b> providing solid grounds for computationalism). 2. Piccinini's answer: it has to meet the objectivity <b>criterion</b> (i. <b>e.</b> identifying computation {{as a matter of}} fact), the explanation <b>criterion</b> (i. <b>e.</b> explaining the computer's behaviour), the right things compute criterion, the miscomputation <b>criterion</b> (i. <b>e.</b> accounting for malfunctions), the taxonomy <b>criterion</b> (i. <b>e.</b> distinguishing between different classes of computers) and the empirical criterion. 3. Von Neumann's answer: it has to meet the precision and reliability of computers criterion, the single error <b>criterion</b> (i. <b>e.</b> addressing the impacts of errors) and the distinction between analogue and digital computers criterion. 4. “Everything ” computes answer: it has to meet the implementation theory criterion by properly explaining the notion of implementation. According to computationalists, minds are computational. Before we can judge the plausibility of any particular computationalist theory, we need to understand what notion of computation this theory employs. Although there are extant accounts of computation, any of which may, in principle, serve as a basis for computationalism, it isn’t clear that they’re all equivalent or even adequate as accounts of computation proper. By examining plausible alternatives to Smith’s adequacy criteria, our goal here is to resist his claim that no adequate account of computation proper is possible. ∗ This is a revised preprint of the article appearing in Minds & Machines.

40|$|A novel {{extension}} of the classical signal -adaptive median filter (SAM) is proposed in this paper. It is the so-called morphological signal -adaptive median filter (MSAM). Two modifications are introduced in the SAM filter aiming at: (1) enhancing SAM impulse detection mechanism so that it detects not only impulses of a constant amplitude but randomly-valued impulses as well, (2) employing an anisotropic window adaptation based on binary morphological erosions/dilations with predefined structuring sets. Performance results are reported by evaluating both objective <b>criteria</b> (<b>e.</b> g. SNR, MAE) and subjective <b>criteria</b> (<b>e.</b> g. the perceived quality of the filtered images). The proposed MSAM filter outperforms the classical SAM filter in all cases. 1. INTRODUCTION The corruption of images by noise is a frequently encountered problem in many image processing tasks.

40|$|Abstract. Decision {{trees are}} {{probably}} the most popular and commonly-used classification model.

When this dataset contains numerical attributes, binary splits are usually performed by choosing the threshold value which minimizes the impurity measure used as splitting <b>criterion</b> (<b>e.</b> g. C 4. 5 gain ratio criterion or CART Gini’s index).
