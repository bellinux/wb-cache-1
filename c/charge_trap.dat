40|$|Flash {{memory is}} {{the most widely used}} {{non-volatile}} memory device nowadays. In order {{to keep up with the}} demand for increased memory capacities, flash memory has been continuously scaled to smaller and smaller dimensions. The main benefits of down-scaling cell size and increasing integration are that they enable lower manufacturing cost as well as higher performance. <b>Charge</b> <b>trapping</b> memory is regarded as one of the most promising flash memory technologies as further down-scaling continues. In addition, more and more exploration is investigated with high-k dielectrics implemented in the <b>charge</b> <b>trapping</b> memory.

50|$|This {{structure}} {{takes advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} <b>charge</b> <b>trap</b> layer does not need to be insulated between each control gate, so it need not be etched in the vertical direction.|$|E
50|$|One {{advantage}} of the nitride layer {{is that it is}} less sensitive to high temperature fabrication processing than is the polysilicon used in a floating gate. This simplifies processing of the layers above the <b>charge</b> <b>trap.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a <b>charge</b> <b>trapping</b> flash {{electrons}} {{are stored}} in a trapping layer just as they {{are stored in}} the floating gate in a standard flash memory, EEPROM, or EPROM.

50|$|Like the {{floating}} gate memory cell, a charge trapping cell uses a variable charge between the control gate {{and the channel}} to change the threshold voltage of the transistor.

50|$|In {{a similar}} way, {{one end of}} the charge {{trapping}} cell can be erased by placing the erasing field at one end or the other of the channel, allowing the other end to float as shown in Figure 3.

50|$|Both {{floating}} gate flash and charge trapping flash use a stacked gate structure {{in which a}} {{floating gate}} or charge trapping layer lies immediately above the channel, and below a control gate. The floating gate or charge trapping layer is insulated from the channel by a tunnel oxide layer and from the control gate by a gate oxide layer.

40|$|In this letter, {{we report}} an {{approach}} to quantitative study {{of the relationship between}} the oxide <b>charge</b> <b>trapping</b> over the drain extension due to electrical stress and the off-state drain leakage current. It is found that positive <b>charge</b> <b>trapping</b> over the drain extension leads to a significant increase in the off-state drain current if the edge direct tunneling (EDT) is dominant in the drain current but in contrast, it leads to a reduction in the drain current if the band-to-band tunneling in the Si surface is dominant. A quantitative relationship between the <b>charge</b> <b>trapping</b> and the off-state drain leakage current in the EDT regime is established.
