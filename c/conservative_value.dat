40|$|In {{a sample}} of 677 adolescents, {{extracted}} from 39 classes in 15 different high schools in Trento, Italy, a multilevel analysis was performed to analyze the relations between adolescents' <b>conservative</b> <b>values,</b> {{their perceptions of the}} <b>conservative</b> <b>values</b> their mothers would like to transmit to them (i. e., maternal socialization <b>values)</b> and the <b>conservative</b> <b>values</b> prevalent in their class context (i. e., classmates' and teachers' <b>values).</b> Perceived mothers' <b>conservative</b> <b>values</b> positively predicted adolescents' conservatism, while the mean class conservatism and teachers' conservatism did not. Also the cross-level interaction between mothers' and classmates' <b>conservative</b> <b>values</b> significantly predicted adolescents' <b>conservative</b> <b>values.</b> In particular, the relation between perceived mothers' conservatism and children's conservatism was stronger when adolescents perceived an alignment between their classmates' <b>conservative</b> <b>values</b> and their mothers' expectations of those values.
