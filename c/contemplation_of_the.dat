5|$|In Ancient Judaism, {{his fourth}} major {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion, Weber attempted to explain the factors {{that resulted in the}} early differences between Oriental and Occidental religiosity. He contrasted the innerworldly asceticism developed by Western Christianity with mystical <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind developed in India. Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections. This fundamental characteristic of Christianity (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish prophecy.|$|E
5|$|The {{work for}} which Traherne {{is best known}} today is the Centuries of Meditations, a {{collection}} of short paragraphs in which he reflects on Christian life and ministry, philosophy, happiness, desire and childhood. This was first published in 1908 after having been rediscovered in manuscript ten years earlier. His poetry likewise was first published in 1903 and 1910 (The Poetical Works of Thomas Traherne, B.D. and Poems of Felicity). His prose works include Roman Forgeries (1673), Christian Ethics (1675), and A Serious and Patheticall <b>Contemplation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mercies of God (1699).|$|E

5|$|Traherne was an inconsequential {{literary}} figure {{during his}} lifetime and his works were not known or appreciated until long after his death. As a country priest he led a devout, humble life and {{did not participate in}} literary circles. Only one of his works, Roman Forgeries (1673), was published in his lifetime. Christian Ethicks (1675) followed soon after his death, and later A Serious and Patheticall <b>Contemplation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mercies of God (1699), which was published as the work of an anonymous author whose character and background were discussed in a brief introduction by the publisher. From 1699 until the re-emergence of his work with Bertram Dobell's editions in 1903, Traherne's work fell into obscurity. If not for the chance discovery of an anonymous manuscript, his work and reputation might have been lost.|$|E

The office of Chairman was first introduced relatively late in the museum's history in the 1960s in <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anticipated donation of the Lehman collection to the museum and has since that time, under Brodsky, become the most senior administrative position at the museum.|$|E

25|$|For Schweitzer, mankind had {{to accept}} that {{objective}} reality is ethically neutral. It could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual rationalism, by giving priority to volition or ethical will as the primary meaning of life. Mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization: the world-view must derive from the life-view, not vice versa. Respect for life, overcoming coarser impulses and hollow doctrines, leads the individual {{to live in the}} service of other people and of every living creature. In <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> will-to-life, respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity.|$|E
25|$|In their imaginative use of {{traditional}} iconography the artists {{put us in}} touch with a wealth of theological tradition that had developed over centuries and had marked with its symbols the meditative road into the depth dimension. Behind the pictures in these volumes we meet not only the theology of an individual Christian but also a theology expressive of the collective witness of many generations who drew their strength from the <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> realities to which their symbols pointed. There is nothing that could prevent a miniature from the Hours of Catherine of Cleves from becoming an effective help of Christian meditation today.|$|E
25|$|Stations of the Cross or the Way of the Cross, {{also known}} as Way of Sorrows or Via Crucis, refers {{to a series of}} images {{depicting}} Jesus Christ on the day of his crucifixion and accompanying prayers.

The object of the stations is to help the Christians faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in the churches of many Western Christian denominations, including Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Roman Catholic.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Stafford Betty, {{teacher for}} Religious Studies at California State University, Bakersfield finds common ground between Tolle's worldview {{and that of}} Christian mystics. He notes that [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key {{elements}} in Tolle's teaching is that deep within the mind is absolute stillness in which one can experience 'the joy of Being'". Roman Catholic priest and theologian Richard Rohr credits Tolle for helping to reintroduce ancient Christian mysticism to modern Christians: [...] "Tolle is, in fact, rather brilliantly bringing to our awareness the older tradition ... both {{the ground and the}} process for breaking through to <b>the</b> theological <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> God, and acquired <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> Jesus, <b>the</b> Gospels, and all spiritual things." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} Bachelor´s {{thesis is}} analyzing and comparing <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> Denmark´s and Sweden´s present security policy.

30|$|<b>The</b> time aspect <b>of</b> {{pictorial}} thinking {{differs from}} real time. Vasarhelyi outlines how verbal descriptions have a beginning, middle and end whereas one image can simultaneously show different time frames: “…however complex their contents might be they don’t {{need time to}} start, progress and finish … they transcend time {{in the sense that}} time is only involved in <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> them; <b>the</b> picture itself is non-temporal,” (Vasarhelyi 1981). Vasarhelyi proposes that this facilitates easier access to the unconscious (Vasarhelyi 1990).|$|R
25|$|West and Central African {{religious}} practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies or divinatory rites in {{which members of}} the community, overcome by force (or ashe, nyama, etc.), are excited {{to the point of}} going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic or mantric drumming or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in Gabon and Cameroon is the Okuyi, practiced by several Bantu ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness. When this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, practitioners are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature and sources of pure energy or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, culturally appropriate behavior, thought, and speech. Further, this practice can also give rise to those in these trances uttering words which, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate or diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions which the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal.|$|E

50|$|For Arthur Schopenhauer {{aesthetic}} <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> {{beauty is}} <b>the</b> most free that the pure intellect can be from <b>the</b> dictates <b>of</b> will; here we contemplate perfection of form without {{any kind of}} worldly agenda, and thus any intrusion of utility or politics would ruin <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beauty.

500|$|Accordingly, the Nyssen {{taught that}} due to God's infinitude, a created being can never reach an {{understanding}} of God, and thus for man in both life and the afterlife {{there is a constant}} progression [...] towards the unreachable knowledge of God, as the individual continually transcends all which has been reached before. In the Life of Moses, Gregory speaks of three stages of this spiritual growth: initial darkness of ignorance, then spiritual illumination, and finally a darkness of the mind in mystic <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> God who cannot be comprehended.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an edition <b>of</b> <b>Contemplations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dread and Love of God, a late Middle English devotional prose text {{for which no}} critical edition is currently available. I have transcribed and collated the text from all sixteen extant manuscripts and the 1506 printed edition. An investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> errors and variants according to <b>the</b> classical method <b>of</b> textual criticism has yielded little in <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> conclusive results, and it has therefore not proved possible to construct a stemma <b>of</b> manuscripts from <b>the</b> corpus <b>of</b> evidence as it now exists. My edition therefore uses one manuscript (Maidstone MS Museum 6) as a base; I emend <b>the</b> text <b>of</b> Maidstone where necessary, and cite variants {{from all the other}} witnesses to show all differences of substance. A full critical apparatus is provided, comprising: the text with variants, textual notes and glossary. The introduction includes a full description <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> manuscripts and the two early printed editions, an outline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methods <b>of</b> textual criticism applied and their results, and an explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> base manuscript; information about <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maidstone manuscript and <b>the</b> date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text are also provided, as is an outline of my editorial principles.

500|$|The North Galleries, {{which opened}} to the public in 1975, marked the arrival of modernist {{architecture}} at the National Gallery. In the older rooms, the original classical details were effaced by partitions, daises and suspended roofs, the aim being to create neutral settings which did not distract from <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paintings. But the Gallery's commitment to modernism was short-lived: by the 1980s Victorian style was no longer considered anathema, and a restoration programme began to restore the 19th- and early-20th-century interiors to their purported original appearance. This began with the refurbishment of the Barry Rooms in 1985–6. From 1996 to 1999 even the North Galleries, by then considered to [...] "lack a positive architectural character" [...] were remodelled in a classical style, albeit a simplified one.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} [...] "Judas-pennies", ancient coins {{said to be}} from the {{original}} thirty, were treated as relics in the Middle Ages, and were believed to help in difficult cases of childbirth. [...] As a minor component of the Instruments, and one whose survival was hard to explain given the Biblical account of the use of the money, the relics, and their depiction in art, both appear from the 14th century, later than more important elements like the Crown of Thorns or Spear of Longinus. [...] This was as a result of new styles of devotions, led by the Franciscans in particular, which promoted [...] <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Passion episode by episode, as in the Stations of the Cross. [...] The stone on which the coins were said to have been counted out was in the Lateran Palace in Rome.|$|E
500|$|The centre {{foreground}} shows a {{group of}} five mourners, with three other figures set {{to the right and}} left. In the center group, John the Evangelist supports the Virgin Mary, surrounded by three women. Mary's dramatic swoon in grief pushes her forward in the pictorial space, and according to Smith, places her [...] "closest to the viewer's presumed position". Dressed in an enveloping blue robe that hides most of her face, she collapses and is caught by John, who supports her by her arms. Mary Magdalene kneels to the right, dressed in a white-trimmed green robe and red sleeves. Raising her arms aloft, she clenches her fingers in a distraught, agonised manner. She is the only figure from this group shown to look directly at Christ and serves as one of the key painterly devices to direct the viewer's gaze upwards towards the crosses. The fourth and fifth mourners have been identified as prophesying sibyls, and stand to the far left and right of the centre group. The sibyl to the left faces the cross {{with her back to the}} viewer while the turbaned mourner on the right faces the group and is either the Erythraean or the Cumaean sibyl, both of whom are attributed in Christian tradition with warning the occupying Romans of the cult of redemption that would develop around Christ's death and resurrection. She has an almost indifferent expression that has been interpreted both as satisfaction at seeing her prophesies realised, and as compassionate <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other women's grief.|$|E

50|$|Friedrich created {{another version}} of this {{painting}} titled Two Men Contemplating the Moon, and, as the name suggests, it lacks the female figure.

They are viewing the moon together in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest, signifying an appreciation of and emotional response to nature.

5|$|<b>The</b> {{establishment}} <b>of</b> Christianity from <b>the</b> {{sixth century}} brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories {{of knowledge and}} education, often running schools and providing a small, educated and overwhelmingly male, elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society. Literary life revolved around <b>the</b> <b>contemplation</b> <b>of</b> texts and <b>the</b> copying <b>of</b> manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it demonstrates that the monks were part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainstream <b>of</b> European Christian culture.|$|R
