(Chemistry) Abstract: This study {{developed}} carbon nanocomposite modified on exfoliated graphite electrodes {{that are}} sensitive and selective for the electrochemical detection of mercury and arsenic. This research explores the new material called exfoliated graphite {{for the detection}} of heavy metals in water. The material is relatively cheap and is a promising material {{for the detection of}} heavy metals. The exfoliated graphite was prepared by intercalation of natural graphite flakes with a particle size of 300 μm by soaking them in a mixture of <b>concentrated</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>sulphuric</b> <b>acid</b> and nitric acid in the ratio 3 : 1 respectively. After the intercalation the resulting material was exfoliated. The exfoliation was achieved by subjecting the intercalated graphite to high temperatures of 800 ºC in a furnace for about 30 seconds. The puffed up material was named exfoliated graphite (EG). The EG was compressed into pellets of 5 mm using high pressure hydraulic press. The mercury nanocomposite sensor was designed by incorporation of carbon nanotube/polyaniline (CNT/PANI) composite followed by electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles onto the EG electrode. This electrode was named CNT/PANI/AuNPs-EG. The dispersion of carbon nanotubes onto the polymer was obtained via the in situ polymerization method. This electrode was name CNT/PANI/EG. The electrodeposition of gold nanoparticles was achieved by preparing 5 mM of HAuCl 4 solution and cycling the potential from - 200 mV to 1100 mV for 10 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. this electrode was used for the detection of mercury in water.
