The national consensus (albeit by a frighteningly slim margin) was that this wasn't who we, as a people, wanted to be. But now, four years later, Zero Dark Thirty <b>comes</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> it seems that that we've become so blunted to the horror of what we did and/or are doing at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and Bagram and other places that we can accept it, provided we get a boffo movie out of it.|$|E

500|$|Saadiq's songwriting is {{characterized}} by straightforward romanticism, positive exhortations, pining ballads, and message songs. Christgau interpreted Saadiq's persona on the album to be [...] "a romantic who stays true to the deliberate simplicity" [...] of the song titles, but [...] "never threatens to assume the fetal position if he doesn't get the extreme cuddling he craves." [...] Patrick Varine of the Observer-Dispatch asserted that Saadiq deviates significantly from contemporary R lyrics: [...] "there are no thinly-veiled food-sex metaphors or pimp fantasies". His songwriting also paraphrases classic soul lyrics and, on the album's slower songs, expresses tightly coiled emotions. Saadiq said that some songs were written about his life experiences. He described the album as [...] "basically a series of love songs about music, how falling in love can be easy, but staying true to it can be tricky." [...] He elaborated on this interpretation in an interview for the Chicago Tribune: [...] "You {{have to watch out}} for those curves. [...] music <b>comes</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> how do you stay true to what you love? I’m not saying everything has to sound like a '60s record to stay true, but you should never take the relationship lightly." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the large}} {{success of the}} demo version, Yankovic wanted to put the song {{on one of his}} albums. However, the immensely complex process of getting {{permission}} from George Lucas and the publishers of the Kinks' [...] "Lola" [...] delayed the release of the song for about five years. Eventually, after Lucas gave Yankovic permission, the song's publishers turned Al down. [...] Several versions of why the parody was turned down exist. In a 1985 interview with Spin, Yankovic explained that, [...] "We approached Ray Davies , we've been approaching him every year and a half, two years before each album <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> he's always been a little skeptical, a little afraid because 'Lola' was a very personal song for him. Then just out of the blue he decided this time to let us do it." [...] However, the liner notes to the [...] present a different story. According to the album's notes, the song may have remained unreleased for some time {{had it not been for}} a chance encounter Yankovic had with the song's original songwriter, Ray Davies. When Yankovic asked why he hadn't given him permission, Davies remarked that he had never been asked. Davies immediately gave Yankovic permission to record the song, and the song was later released on Dare to Be Stupid.|$|E
