25|$|There {{are many}} fossils of beetles known from this era, though the beetle fauna of the Paleocene is {{comparatively}} poorly investigated. In contrast, the knowledge on the Eocene beetle fauna is very good. The {{reason is the}} occurrence of fossil insects in amber and <b>clay</b> <b>slate</b> sediments. Amber is fossilized tree resin, that means it consists of fossilized organic compounds, not minerals. Different amber is distinguished by location, age and species of the resin producing plant. For the research on the Oligocene beetle fauna, Baltic and Dominican amber is most important. Even with the insect fossils record in general lacking, the most diverse deposit being from the Fur Formation, Denmark; including giant ants and primitive moths (Noctuidae).|$|E

[47] [...] "Some idea may {{be formed}} {{of the nature}} of these incurvations by [...] supposing the gneiss beds to have been in a plastic state, either [...] from the action of heat or of some other unknown cause, and, while [...] in this state, to have been {{subjected}} to pressure at the two [...] extremities, or in some other parts, according {{to the nature of the}} [...] curvatures. But even this hypothesis (though the best that has been [...] thought of) will scarcely enable us to explain all the contortions [...] which not merely the beds of gneiss, but likewise of mica slate and [...] <b>clay</b> <b>slate,</b> and even greywacke slate, exhibit. There is a bed of [...] <b>clay</b> <b>slate</b> near the ferry to Kerrera, a few miles south of Oban, in [...] Argyleshire.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} use of {{magnetic}} properties {{as an indicator of}} weathering of tropical soils. Soil samples collected across the tropical belt were analysed for magnetic susceptibility and its frequency dependence. Frequency dependence is caused by superparamagnetic (SP) ferrimagnetic nanoparticles, which are commonly attributed to neoformation during soil forming processes. Magnetic properties are compared to the redness rating of soil colour, which is related to the hematite content and is an established proxy for soil weathering. The investigated samples comprise material of different weathering stages from unweathered and weathered rock to subsoil and strongly weathered topsoil. They cover a broad variety of parent materials: ultrabasic, basic, intermediate, acid igneous rocks, <b>clays</b> and <b>clay</b> <b>slates,</b> phyllites and sandstones. The results show that soil reddening, magnetic susceptibility and in particular frequency-dependent susceptibility generally increase with proceeding weathering. However, there is a lithologic overprint and the parent material has to be taken into consideration. Soils stemming from acid igneous rocks, <b>clays,</b> <b>clay</b> <b>slates</b> and phyllites show a positive correlation between reddening and susceptibility or frequency dependent susceptibility, rendering these properties suitable for indicating weathering. In contrast, soils stemming from ultrabasic, basic and intermediate igneous rocks and sandstones show no significant correlation. The reason is the strong lithogenic overprint of ferrimagnetic minerals including SP particles, which commonly occur in these rock types...|$|R

60|$|The elephant-drivers {{appeared}} to have taken us by mistake to the exit of the Chawa, a small stream which joins the Teesta further to the eastward. The descent to the bed of this rivulet, round the first spur of rock we met with, was fully eighty feet, through a very irregular depression, probably the old bed of the stream; it runs southwards from the hills, and was covered {{from top to bottom}} with slate-pebbles. We followed the river to its junction with the Teesta, along a flat, broad gulley, bounded by densely-wooded, steep banks of <b>clay</b> <b>slate</b> on the north, and the lofty bank on the south: between these the bed was strewed with great boulders of gneiss and other rocks, luxuriantly clothed with long grass, and trees of wild plantain, Erythrina and Bauhinia, the latter gorgeously in flower.|$|E
60|$|From this steppe, {{the ascent}} to Punkabaree is sudden and steep, and {{accompanied}} {{with a change}} in soil and vegetation. The mica slate and <b>clay</b> <b>slate</b> protrude everywhere, the former full of garnets. A giant forest replaces the stunted and bushy timber of the Terai Proper; of which the Duabanga and Terminalias form the prevailing trees, with Cedrela and the Gordonia Wallichii. Smaller timber and shrubs are innumerable; a succulent character pervades the bushes and herbs, occasioned by the prevalence of Urticeae. Large bamboos rather crest the hills than court the deeper shade, and of the latter there is abundance, for the torrents cut a straight, deep, and steep course down the hill flanks: the galleys they traverse are choked with vegetation and bridged by fallen trees, whose trunks are richly clothed with Dendrobium Pierardi and other epiphytical Orchids, with pendulous Lycopodia and many ferns, Hoya, Scitamineae, and similar types of the hottest and dampest climates.|$|E

The short divide beyond the far bank of the Sirr is strewn with glittering mica-schist that takes the forms of tree-trunks and rotten wood; and with dark purple-blue fragments of clay-slate looking {{as if they had}} been worked. A counterslope of the same material, which makes excellent path-metal placed us in the Wady Rubayyigh ("the Little Rábigh" [...] or [...] "Green-grown Spring"), a short and proportionally very broad branch draining to the Sirr. Here large outcrops of quartz mingled with the <b>clay</b> <b>slate.</b> A few yards further it abutted upon a small gravelly basin with ruins and a huge white reef of [...] "Mará," [...] which caused a precipitate dismounting. We had marched only four hours (= thirteen miles); but the loss of time has its compensations.

Thandwe is very ancient, and {{is said to have}} been at one time the capital of Rakhine State, then called Arakan. The district has an area of 3784 sq mi. The country is mountainous, the Arakan Mountains sending out spurs which reach the coast. Some of the peaks in the north attain 4,000 and more ft. The streams are only mountain torrents to within a few miles of the coast; the mouth of the Khwa forms a good anchorage for vessels of from 9 to 10 ft. draught.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the predominant minerals in sedimentary rocks using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and chemometric analysis. The chemometric analysis was performed on three types of sedimentary rock samples (claystones, <b>clay</b> <b>slates,</b> and sandstones), each with different predominant mineral components. Chemometric models were created to determine the major minerals of the rock samples studied chlorite, muscovite, albite, and quartz. The FTIR spectra were obtained in transmission mode from pressed pellets of KBr-sample mixtures or by diffuse reflectance from hand-packed mixtures of samples with KBr. Spectral regions measured were 4000 - 3000 and 1300 - 400 cm- 1, which contained important spectral information for the creation of the chemometric models. Principal component analysis was used in the chemometric method, with calibration models being created by a partial least-squares regression method. The mean relative error, standard error of prediction, and relative standard deviation were calculated for the assessment of accuracy, precision, and reproducibility. The value of the mean relative error was 15 - 20 % for most of the calibration models; the value of the standard error of prediction was up to 6 w/w % for most of the calibration models. The values of the standard relative deviation ranged from ∼ 2 to 8 % for calibration models based on diffuse reflectance spectra whereas calibration models based on transmission spectra had values of relative standard deviation of ∼ 15 - 20 %.
