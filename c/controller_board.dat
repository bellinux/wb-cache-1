40|$|A {{document}} concisely {{describes a}} ring bus architecture for a proposed solid-state recorder (SSR) {{that would serve}} as buffer of {{data to be transmitted}} from a spacecraft to Earth. This architecture would afford fault tolerance needed for reliable operation in an anticipated high-radiation environment in which traditional SSRs cannot operate reliably. Features of the architecture include one or more <b>controller</b> <b>boards</b> and multiple memory boards interconnected in a ringlike topology. The interconnections would be high-speed serial links complying with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard 1393 (which pertains to a spaceborne fiber-optic data bus). Accordingly, each <b>controller</b> and memory <b>board</b> would be equipped with an IEEE- 1393 -compliant ring-bus-interface unit. The ringlike topology and the multiplicity of memory boards (and, optionally, of <b>controller</b> <b>boards)</b> would afford the redundancy needed for fault tolerance. Each board would be a fault-containment region. The IEEE 1393 links could be routed so that the SSR would continue to function even in the event of multiple failures. This architecture would also support scalability over a wide range. In a fully redundant configuration, it could accommodate between 1 and 125 memory boards...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} serial {{communication}} bus for a traction vehicle. The first part summarises requirements on a serial bus for a distribution control system inside a traction vehicle. According to requirements a suitable bus controller was chosen. The main effort is concentrated on the definition of a new communication protocol. The protocol is called the Vehicle Local Bus (VLB). It is based on a Controller Area Network. The serial bus supports all necessary data types for a real time control as short period data, short sporadic data, critical-deadline sporadic data, message data. The serial bus can be implemented {{on a wide range of}} microcontrollers or microprocessors because a programming interface is defined in the C language. The results of the thesis are also presented on an actual application for a high speed intercity train. The design of the auxiliary drive control system utilizes three difference <b>controller</b> <b>boards</b> with the VLB interface. All <b>controller</b> <b>boards</b> are based on the INTEL 196 microcontrollers. The design also includes the software for downloading and debugging in real time through the VLB.
