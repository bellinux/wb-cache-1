2500|$|Speaking on the {{possibility}} of more sting operations, Lt. Matthew Stapleton of the Petaluma, California Police Department said: [...] "f we have the resources in the future, absolutely, we might do one. ... I don't think we would do a Dateline sting again, but we established a partnership with Perverted Justice, so they <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>us,</b> if necessary."

Practically such an application could be implemented as a computer-based support system... which would help actors to structure their problems, ideas and information, by recombination and closure of simple components." [...] Furthermore, Jan Kooistra (1988) stipulated the problem of [...] "the absence of a terminology." [...] He noted: ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Metallica recording, the band's songs were written mainly by {{frontman}} James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, with Hetfield being the lyricist. The duo frequently composed together at Ulrich's house in Berkeley, California. Several song ideas and concepts were conceived by {{other members of the}} band, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Jason Newsted. For instance, Newsted wrote the main riff of [...] "My Friend of Misery", which was originally intended to be an instrumental, one of which had been included on every previous Metallica album. The songs were written in two months in mid-1990; the ideas for some of them were originated during the Damaged Justice Tour. Metallica was impressed with Bob Rock's production work on Mötley Crüe's Dr. Feelgood (1989) and decided to hire him to work on their album. Initially, the band members were not interested in having Rock producing the album as well, but changed their minds. Ulrich said, [...] "We felt that we still had our best record in us and Bob Rock <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> make it".|$|E
2500|$|Colvin's first {{involvement}} with international cricket came in August 2005, when the England team {{was preparing to}} face the Australian women's international team at the Hove County Cricket Ground. She was invited to bowl against the English team in the nets to give them practice against a left-arm spinner, who the Australian team was fielding {{in the form of}} Shelley Nitschke. After the practice session, Colvin was asked to be available for the four-day [...] by team coach Richard Bates. Team captain Clare Connor admitted that her inclusion was [...] "pure hunch", believing that the dry, dusty wicket would be favourable to spin bowling. Bates explained to The Times that [...] "the pitch [...] a little worn, and we felt that Holly <b>could</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> exploit it". Colvin made her England debut on 9 August 2005, becoming at 15 years and 336 days the youngest cricketer (of either sex) to play Test cricket for England. She took three wickets in her inaugural game, dismissing Kate Blackwell and Julia Price in two consecutive balls and nearly taking Julie Hayes for a hat-trick. Reminiscing over the experience in February 2008, Colvin remarked that [...] "I think I was fortunate... I had no idea who I was playing against – all these big names that were coming up against me and I had pretty much no idea". She described her near-hat-trick as a [...] "pretty special [...] ".|$|E
