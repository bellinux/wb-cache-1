50|$|When grey-market {{products}} are advertised on Google, eBay or other legitimate web sites, {{it is possible}} to petition for removal of any advertisements that violate trademark or copyright laws. This can be done directly, without the involvement of legal professionals. For example, eBay will remove listings of such products even in countries where their purchase and use is not against the law. Manufacturers may refuse to supply distributors and retailers (and with commercial products, customers) that trade in grey market goods. They may also more broadly limit supplies in markets where prices are low. Manufacturers may refuse to honor the warranty of an item purchased from grey market sources, {{on the grounds that the}} higher price on the non-grey market reflects a higher level of service even though the manufacturer does of course control their own prices to distributors. Alternatively, they may provide the warranty service only from the manufacturer's subsidiary in the intended <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>import,</b> not the diverted third country where the grey-market goods are ultimately sold by the distributor or retailer. This response to the grey market is especially evident in electronics goods. Local laws (or customer demand) concerning distribution and packaging (for example, the language on labels, units of measurement, and nutritional disclosure on foodstuffs) can be brought into play, as can national standards certifications for certain goods.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{conceptual}} framework and methodology for studying virtual water trade. We utilize complex network theory {{to analyze the}} structure of the global virtual water trade associated with the international food trade. In the global virtual water trade network, the nations that participate in the international food trade correspond to the nodes, and the links represent the flows of virtual water associated with the trade of food from the country of export to the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>import.</b> We find that the number of trade connections follows an exponential distribution, except for the case of import trade relationships, while the volume of water that each nation trades compares well with a stretched exponential distribution, indicating high heterogeneity of flows between nations. There is a power law relationship between the volume of virtual water traded and the number of trade connections of each nation. Highly connected nations are preferentially linked to poorly connected nations and exhibit low levels of clustering. However, when the volume of virtual water traded is taken into account, this structure breaks down. This indicates a global hierarchy, in which nations that trade large volumes of water are more likely to link to and cluster with other nations that trade large volumes of water, particularly when the direction of trade is considered. Nations that {{play a critical role in}} maintaining the global network architecture are highlighted. Our analysis provides the necessary framework for the development of a model of global virtual water trade aimed at applications ranging from network optimization to climate change impact evaluations...|$|E

In {{the experiment}}, the meat quality of 1980 pigs was evaluated. The animals were divided into three groups according to <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>import</b> (Slovakia, Hungary and Netherlands). The following pre-slaughter indicators were evaluated: duration of transport, duration of housing, temperature during housing and transport. The meat quality was judged {{on the basis of the}} pH 1 value measured 45 minutes after the slaughter in the musculus longissimus dorsi – pH 1 MLD and in the musculus semimembranosus – pH 1 MSM. The highest frequency of PSE (pale, soft, exudative) meat in the MLD was in the group of pigs imported from Slovakia (24. 13 %). These pigs had also statistically significant (P< 0. 01) the lowest average pH 1 MLD (6. 05) in comparison with other imports. The incidence of PSE meat in the MSM was in all evaluated groups above 10 %. Group of pigs from Slovakia had the lowest value of pH 1 MSM (6. 23) in comparison with other groups of pigs (P< 0. 01). Even though the average length of housing in a slaughterhouse was from 11. 26 to 15. 43 hours high incidence of PSE meat was recorded. However group of pigs with the longest rest period (15. 43 hours - Netherlands) had significantly higher pH 1 MLD and pH 1 MSM compared to other imports (P< 0. 01). From these results can be concluded that the incidence of PSE meat in evaluated groups is relatively high.

40|$|Emphasis on the {{importance}} of halal products is now growing. It is fast becoming a new market force and brand identifier and is now moving into the mainstream market, affecting and changing perception on how business should be conducted, including from a marketing point of view. Halal is no longer just purely a religious issue. It is in the realm of business and trade, and it is becoming a global symbol for quality assurance and lifestyle choice. Halal products are those that are Shariah compliant, i. e. do not involve the use of haram (prohibited) ingredients, exploitation of labor or environment, and are not harmful or intended for harmful use. The realm of halal may extend to all consumables such as toiletries, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and services including finance. Halal is a typical credence process attribute, i. e. a quality characteristic that can hardly be evaluated or ascertained by the individual consumer, even upon or after consuming the food. Nowadays, Muslims are making their presence felt socially and politically and are requesting halal-certified food products. Currently, a certain degree of assurance is provided by halal certification of halal products. There are two types of halal certificates, and their duration depends on the type of food or beverage. Any individual Muslim, Islamic organization or agency can issue a halal certificate, but the acceptability of the certificate depends upon the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>import</b> or the Muslim community served through such certification. With the complexity of manufacturing systems and the utilization of all animal by products, any product consumed by Muslims may be certified, whether the product is consumed internally or applied to the body externally. The halal certification process starts with choosing an organization that meets the needs for the markets to be serviced. The halal logo is an authoritative, independent and reliable testimony to support halal food claims. This conceptually-based paper critically reviews and amalgamates a diverse range of literature concerning Islamic rules. The way that organizations issue halal certificates for halal producers and use of the halal logo on products. In addition, the paper utilizes necessary religion sources and legal documents. The halal concept (especially for foods) is truly from the farm to the table, and requires nutritious items prepared from permissible ingredients in a clean and hygienic manner. Muslim consumers are very similar to any other consumer segments, demanding healthy and quality products, which must also conform to Shariah requirements. Halal certificate can play an important role to assure consumers that the product has got the necessary conditions of halal product...|$|E

In contrast, the estimated effect for export shares is found to be negative suggesting that as a developing <b>country’s</b> share <b>of</b> total UK exports rises, the demand for UK student visas falls.
