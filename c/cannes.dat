50|$|<b>Canne</b> défense means self-defense {{with the}} <b>canne.</b> The basic {{techniques}} {{are similar to}} those used in basic <b>canne,</b> but are expanded to include thrusts, slashes, parries and counter-attacks, neck and handlocks and releases from holds. During <b>canne</b> défense every vulnerable part of the body is considered a legitimate target: the elbow, the knee, the face, etc. It is under heavy development. Because <b>canne</b> défense techniques are more dangerous, there are no <b>canne</b> défense competitions or free sparring, only paired techniques.|$|R

50|$|<b>Canne</b> de combat is a French martial art. As weapon, {{it uses a}} cane or <b>canne</b> (a kind of walking-stick) {{designed}} for fighting. <b>Canne</b> de combat was standardized in the 1970s for sporting competition by Maurice Sarry. The <b>canne</b> is very light, made of chestnut wood and slightly tapered. A padded suit and a fencing mask are worn for protection.|$|R
5|$|Although {{she never}} won a BAFTA, Oscar or <b>Cannes</b> Film Festival award in a {{competitive}} category, all three organisations gave Kerr honorary awards: a <b>Cannes</b> Film Festival Tribute in 1984; a BAFTA Special Award in 1991; and an Academy Honorary Award in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Barton Fink premiered in May 1991 at the <b>Cannes</b> Film Festival. Beating {{competition}} {{which included}} Jacques Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse, Spike Lee's Jungle Fever, and David Mamet's Homicide, the Coen brothers' film won three awards: Best Director, Best Actor, {{and the top}} prize Palme d'Or. This sweep of awards in major categories at <b>Cannes</b> was extremely rare, and some critics felt the jury was too generous {{to the exclusion of}} other worthy entries. Worried that the triple victory could set a precedent which would undervalue other films, <b>Cannes</b> decided after the 1991 festival to limit each movie to a maximum of two awards.|$|E

According to The Guardian, Bardot's photographs in particular turned Saint-Tropez into the beachwear {{capital of the}} world, with Bardot identified as the original <b>Cannes</b> bathing beauty.

5000|$|<b>Canne</b> (stick) is a {{chestnut}} stick {{that comes}} in two versions. First (marked with a green line) is heavier and used for training of basic techniques. <b>Canne</b> used in competitions and advanced training is lighter (marked with a black line). Lighter sticks are faster and safer to use (you can't seriously injure your opponent because the stick breaks first). The length of a <b>canne</b> is 95 cm, weight is ca. 120 g for green and ca. 100 g for the black <b>canne.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Manusardi {{family from}} Milan modified, three generations ago, the French art of <b>Canne</b> de combat and created <b>Canne</b> Italiana. According to Italo Manusardi the French style sacrificed power to achieve speed. <b>Canne</b> italiana is {{slower than the}} French style but more {{powerful}} in its blows. Most moves and techniques {{are similar to those}} used in the handling of the dueling sabre (Sciabola da Terreno) hence <b>Canne</b> Italiana represents useful training for those interested in the dueling sabre. The Manusardi gym also teaches [...] "Bastone Italiano" [...] a form of staff fighting similar to Baton francais.|$|R
50|$|The French {{system of}} la <b>canne</b> is still practised as a {{competitive}} sport. A self-defense adaptation of la <b>canne</b> developed by Swiss master-at-arms Pierre Vigny {{in the early}} 1900s has been revived {{as part of the}} curriculum of bartitsu.|$|R
50|$|<b>Canne</b> {{complains}} bitterly of {{his subsequent}} banishment from Hull. On 2 April 1658, {{when he was}} in the pulpit of the meeting-place in Swan Alley, Coleman Street, the marshal of the city entered and arrested him and seven of the brethren who had protested against their rough treatment of the old man. <b>Canne</b> was brought before the lord mayor, and acknowledged that he was not satisfied with the government, and would like an opportunity to tell the Protector so, but declined to enter upon the question with the magistrate. One of the accused, Wentworth Day, was fined and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. John Clark, who had been acquitted by the jury was fined and imprisoned for six months. <b>Canne</b> and the remainder were released on 25 April 1658. A narrative of the transaction was published. <b>Canne</b> was resident in August 1659 at his house in London and the date of his final retreat from England is not known. <b>Canne</b> was the object of some satirical writings of Samuel Butler, who published 'The Acts and Monuments of our late Parliament,' 1659, under the pseudonym of John <b>Canne.</b>|$|R

5|$|Due to {{a change}} in the rules made for the 79th Academy Awards, the Academy {{published}} a shortlist of nine films on January 15, 2008, prior to the selection of the final five nominees. The Academy engendered controversy with its selections, notably the omission of Romania's 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days, which had won the Palme d'Or at the 2007 <b>Cannes</b> Film Festival, and France's Persepolis, the winner of the Jury Prize at the same <b>Cannes</b> Film Festival. After revealing the shortlist, the Academy released a list of nominees on January 22, 2008. The winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was Austria's The Counterfeiters, which was directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky.|$|E
50|$|In 1640 <b>Canne</b> visited England, and the Broadmead {{congregation}} of baptists having been formed {{he was called}} upon to preach to them. He preached both in church and on the green, and debated with Mr. Fowler, the father of Edward Fowler. <b>Canne</b> returned to Amsterdam in the same year. It is supposed that <b>Canne</b> remained at Amsterdam until 1647. In 1650 he was at Kingston-upon-Hull, and acted as chaplain to the governor, Colonel Robert Overton, whose book, Man's Mortalitie, he had printed at Amsterdam in 1643. <b>Canne</b> was in favour with the soldiers as a preacher {{but he had a}} rival in John Shawe. <b>Canne's</b> friends obtained a grant for him from the council of state as his chaplain's salary. His stay in Hull was not long, but in 1653, when he published at London A Voice from the Temple to the Higher Powers, he denounced Shawe as 'a most corrupt man and hitherto countenanced by men as corrupt and rotten as himself.' Shawe himself had a low opinion of <b>Canne,</b> at this time credited with the possession of great influence with the council of state.|$|R

50|$|During {{a double}} <b>canne</b> bout, the cannists hold sticks in both their {{right and left}} hands.

The thirty-five member band performed at Le Suquet in <b>Cannes,</b> in Nice, {{and in front of}} the Prince's Palace of Monaco. After the inaugural trip, the program was dissolved by the joint national councils due to its high cost and low attendance, which was believed to be caused by a fear of traveling abroad after the September 11 attacks.|$|E
