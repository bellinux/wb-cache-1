For example, the Invoke <b>control</b> <b>pattern</b> {{is used for}} controls that can be invoked (such as buttons) and the Scroll <b>control</b> <b>pattern</b> is used for controls that are scrollable viewports (such as list boxes, list views, or combo boxes). Because each <b>control</b> <b>pattern</b> represents a separate functionality, they can be combined to describe the full set of functionality supported by a particular control.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} the management <b>control</b> <b>patterns</b> within the business governance {{of the traditional}} clannish society in Somalia. The study attempts to understand and report the nature and dynamics of control approaches that are used for business governance in Somalia. A qualitative case study was used to gather the data. Semi-structured interviews with the top executive directors, observation and document analyses were employed to triangulate the data sources. The findings of the study show the role of traditional cultural settings on the control systems in Somaliaâ€™s traditional context. The prevalent <b>control</b> <b>patterns</b> include clannish ownership, paternal leadership, friendship and horizontal relationships, verbal communication and selective employment of owners and staff. These <b>control</b> <b>patterns</b> have promoted centralization of decisions including; performance measurement, incentives management and restricted financial information.

50|$|Three {{principal}} {{attributes of}} the new-age terrorism were held to be their hybrid structure (as opposed to the traditional microscopic command and <b>control</b> <b>pattern),</b> importance given to systemic disruption vis-a-vis target destruction, and sophisticated use of technological advancements (including social media and mobile communications technology). A terrorist network could be designed to be either acephalous (headless like Al-Qaeda after Bin Laden) or polycephalous (hydra-headed like Kashmiri separatists). Social media networks supporting the terrorists are characterized by positive feedback loops, tight coupling and non-linear response propagation (viz. a small perturbation causing a large disproportionate response).|$|E

Multiple or disjoint text spans can be represented by more than one TextPatternRange objects. TextPatternRange supports functionality such as clone, selection, comparison, retrieval and traversal.|$|E

However, their shared ownership {{gives rise to}} complexities involving control issues. We propose an integrated model of joint venture control, which adds relational issues to the TCE framework. By combining transaction and relational characteristics, we argue that three different management control patterns can be distinguished: a content-based <b>control</b> <b>pattern,</b> a consultation-based <b>control</b> <b>pattern,</b> and a context-based <b>control</b> <b>pattern.</b> We empirically examine these three patterns by conducting two exploratory case studies.

40|$|Business process {{modeling}} {{is the first}} and the most important task in business process management (BPM). Business process models are implicitly composed of a set of <b>control</b> flow <b>patterns,</b> such as the Parallel Split, Synchronization, Exclusive Choice, and Simple Merge, etc. Several studies have proposed the concepts and definitions of <b>control</b> flow <b>patterns.</b> But, few analyzed the structure of process models to identify the constituent <b>control</b> flow <b>patterns.</b> This research proposes a three-phased framework to recognize the constituent <b>control</b> flow <b>patterns</b> and their interrelationship for a Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) process model. The conceptual phase first describes the conceptual process for identifying the <b>control</b> flow <b>patterns</b> from a process model.

40|$|A {{new system}} to {{optimize}} both <b>control</b> rod <b>pattern</b> and fuel-loading design {{in boiling water}} reactors is shown. The system is named OCOTH, and {{it is based on}} heuristic techniques such as genetic algorithms, neural networks, and ant colonies. Each heuristic technique is used to design a part of the optimization process. So, the neural network finds an initial fuel loading with a Haling burnup calculation. The ant colony system optimizes full-power <b>control</b> rod <b>pattern</b> of the initial fuel loading. Finally, the genetic algorithm optimizes fuel loading with the optimized <b>control</b> rod <b>patterns.</b> The ant colony system and the genetic algorithm perform an iterative loop until a stop criterion is fulfilled;for example, <b>control</b> rod <b>pattern</b> and fuel-loading convergence.

40|$|The black soil {{region in}} Northeast China is an {{important}} region for cereal grain production in the country. However, several decades of overexploitation and unsustainable land use practices have caused substantial loss of soil and soil productivity. The dominant soil erosion processes in the black soil region are water, wind and meltwater erosion, of which water erosion on the slope farmland is the major contributor to soil erosion. According to landforms and characteristics of soil and water loss, the black soil region of Northeast China can be classified as the rolling hill area, the low mountain hill ravine area, and the farming-pastoral area. As a result, land use strategies, including the Three Defense Lines <b>control</b> <b>pattern,</b> the Pyramid Style <b>control</b> <b>pattern,</b> and the <b>control</b> <b>pattern</b> of Minimum Exploiture and Maximal Protection, are proposed for the three respective areas. Moreover, conservation tillage and participatory management are the promising measures {{that have not been}} widely implemented in the black soil region until now. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Three basic mechanisms are distinguished: control by selection, where the controlled element is coinstantiated with an argument of the selecting head; control by feature percolation, where the interpretation {{is determined by the}} syntactic and pragmatic context; and arbitrary "control", which is treated as non-control, where the understood subject argument is specified for generic or arbitrary reference and, hence, needs no controller.

40|$|Background: A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} executive control {{is the ability}} to limit the adverse effects of interference. Previous studies have shown activation of left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex after the onset of interference, suggesting that interference may be resolved in a reactive manner. However, we suggest that interference control may also operate in a proactive manner to prevent effects of interference. The current study investigated the temporal dynamics of interference control by varying two factors â€“ interference expectancy and fluid intelligence (gF) â€“ that could influence whether interference control operates proactively versus reactively. Methodology/Principal Findings: A modified version of the recent negatives task was utilized. Interference expectancy was manipulated across task blocks by changing the proportion of recent negative (interference) trials versus recent positive (facilitation) trials. Furthermore, we explored whether gF affected the tendency to utilize specific interference control mechanisms. When interference expectancy was low, activity in lateral prefrontal cortex replicated prior results showing a reactive <b>control</b> <b>pattern</b> (i. e., interference-sensitivity during probe period). In contrast, when interference expectancy was high, bilateral prefrontal cortex activation was more indicative of proactive control mechanisms (interference-related effects prior to the probe period).

40|$|Abstract High vocal center (HVC) {{can produce}} single sound {{with one or}} two syllables by the sin-gle-type vocal <b>control</b> <b>pattern</b> in songbirds ruddy bunting (Emberiza rutila). It {{obviously}} shows left-side dominance in controlling double syllables, principal frequency (PF) and increasing sound in-tensity of the evoked calls. Meanwhile, the complex-type <b>control</b> <b>pattern</b> can produce complex calls with multisyllable, and also shows significant left-side dominance in controlling the number of sylla-bles, tone changing and sound intensity. These indicate that left-side HVC controls higher frequen-cy and complicated sentence structure. The basic vocal center, dorsomedial nucleus of the intercol-licular complex (DM), controls the monosyllable sound in songbirds, and shows left-side dominance in controlling both the number of syllable and sound intensity. These results not only provide some direct evidence for left-side dominance in high vocal center, but also indicate that there is some internal connection between the high and basic vocal centers in songbirds...|$|E
