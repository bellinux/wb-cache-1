Metrocargo was originally developed as a technical means necessary for creating a network for the intermodal transport of containers and swap bodies, distributed over a territory. In the process, it proved to be very fast (projections show a 40 wagon train can be unloaded and reloaded in less than one hour), which opened up new business possibilities, typically shuttling load units between ports and dry-ports. The construction technology being modular, equipment can be planned according to available space and number of containers to be handled, and increased as necessary. Today the system is fitted with a stand-alone active safety system detecting human presence in the work area, (which means that sound alarms {{do not have to be}} used). This system has been developed within the VIT project.Metrocargo is perfectly consistent with the goal of minimising environmental impact, because both atmospheric and acoustic pollution are almost totally eliminated by the electrically powered automation system. There are no local GHG emissions other than by trucks servicing the terminal, and noise level is very low.Electro-mechanical parts and plant automation software for load/unload were subjected to an exhaustive stress test under the control of an independent entity with specific knowledge of automated plants: Functionality and performance of all components were analysed and data collected and validated. The two main applications of Metrocargo are distributed intermodality and Port to dry-port shuttling.|$|E

40|$|A new {{improved}} {{investment casting}} technology (IC) {{has been presented}} and compared with the existing IC technology such as lost foam casting (LFC). The effect of thermophysical property and coating thickness on casting solidification temperature field, microstructure and hardness has been investigated. The {{results show that the}} solidification rate decreases inversely with the coating thickness when the coating contains silica sol, zircon powder, mullite powder and defoaming agent. In contrast, the solid cooling rate increases as the coating thickness increases. However, the solidification rate and solid cooling rate of the casting produced by the existing IC and the improved IC are very similar when the coating thickness is 5 mm, so the microstructure and hardness of a container <b>corner</b> <b>fitting</b> produced by the improved IC and the existing IC are similar. The linear regression equation for the grain size (d) and cooling rate (v) of the castings is d= – 0. 41 v+ 206. 1.

The new improved IC can greatly simplify the process and decrease the cost of production compared with the existing IC. Contrasting with LFC, container corner fittings produced by the new improved IC have fewer defects and better properties.

For his Innenprojektionen (Interior Projections; 1968-1970) black-and-white photographs, he started using empty slide projections, creating empty squares of light, projected on a wall or in a darkened, closed-off room. This later evolved to his placing slides covered in copy ink with precisely carved vertical and horizontal lines into the projector and then cast throughout the room. Projecting these lines at various angles throughout a darkened space, at windows, <b>corners,</b> wall <b>fittings</b> and architectural irregularities, offered limitless possibilities for the artist. Knoebel documented these light projections with his camera and displayed the variations in large grids, often with as many as 80 photographs comprising a single work.

Projection X (1970-71) and Projektion X Remake (2005), two versions of the same video concept, are his only videotapes based on these outdoor projections. During a nocturnal drive through the sleeping city of Darmstadt, a large, luminous X-shaped beam of light is projected from the vehicle onto the walls of buildings.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Surface fitting {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} stage of the 3 D reconstruction process, since in this stage the computational model of the real object is obtained. NURBS is a surface fitting method widely used that has become a standard in CAD/CAM system due to its stability, flexibility and local modification properties. Despite of the advantages of fitting with NURBS, it is still necessary improve the representation of sharp features like high curvatures, edges and <b>corners</b> with this <b>fitting</b> method. Find a correct parameterization of the NURBS can contribute to improve the representation of sharp features, even though the manipulation of the NURBS parameters imply deal with non linear problems when fitting. In this paper, a new method for improving NURBS surface sharp feature representation is presented. The method first subdivides the fitting data in clusters, by using SOM. Then, in each cluster uses an evolutionary strategy to obtain the weights of the NURBS so that the error fitting is minimized and the representation of sharp features is improved.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} has been {{dedicated}} {{to the subject of}} reverse engineering techniques using soft computing techniques. It particularly emphasizes on the problems of curve fitting for finding the optimal solutions. A detailed survey has been provided, in the literature review, on the subject reported by various authors (see [1 - 105] in Chapter 1). Although people have worked to find the direct methods for problem solving, yet an extensive study is needed for indirect solutions using heuristic like approaches. In this thesis, new reverse engineering techniques are proposed which utilize three soft computing approaches including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA). Spline functions have also been used to find the optimal solutions for curve fitting problems. These soft computing techniques are used to find the optimal values of shape parameters in the description of the proposed spline functions. The underlying methods of reverse engineering consist of several phases including data extraction of image outlines, detection of <b>corner</b> points, and <b>fitting</b> curve using spline functions to the detected corner points. A total of nine algorithms have been designed and implemented. These algorithms are formulated to explain the process of reverse engineering. The proposed schemes help vectorizing the generic shapes and are demonstrated with various practical examples. The examples presented illustrate very well the outcomes and the robustness of the proposed algorithms. The comparisons of the proposed schemes are made with each other as well as with some existing schemes in the literature...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{reliability}} of the focal mechanism solution, we used the absolute amplitudes of the P-and SH-waves as well as the P-wave polarities. We determined the spectral level and the <b>corner</b> frequency by <b>fitting</b> the Ω 2 model (Boatwright, 1978) with an attenuation correction following the method of Ide et al. (2003), after correcting for the instrument response. We estimated the observed amplitude from the spectral level. The best-fitting focal mechanism solution for each event was determined by minimizing the residual between the observed and theoretical amplitudes. A grid search approach was used to determine the strike, dip, and rake angles at 5 ° intervals. We obtained the focal mechanism solutions for 822 events that satisfied the following two conditions: (1) the number of P -wave polarities was ≥ 12 and (2) the magnitude of the event was ≤ 3.0. In order to calculate the azimuth and take-off angle of the focal mechanisms, we used the relocated hypocenter locations. Then, we applied the amplitude station corrections, according to the procedure reported by Imanishi et al. (2006). We estimated the uncertainty in the focal mechanism solution from the standard deviation of the rotation angles (Kagan, 1991) between the best-fitting solution and all of the solutions for which the residual was less than 1.1 times the minimum residual. The average error of all of the focal mechanisms was 6 °. For earthquakes having magnitudes greater than 3.0, we used the moment tensor solutions of the NIED F-net catalog. Variance reductions (VRs) of the moment tensor solutions {{used in the present study}} are greater than 70 %. According to Fukuyama et al (1998), a moment tensor solution with a VR of greater than 70 % is reliable. The error for P - and T -axes is generally within 5 °.|$|R
40|$|The term tape setback method denotes {{a method}} of {{designing}} and fabricating bonded joints between (1) box beams or other structural members made of laminated composite (matrix/ fiber) materials and (2) metal end fittings used to fasten these structural members to other structural members. The basic idea of the tape setback method is to mask the bonded interface between the metallic end fitting and composite member such that the bond does not extend out to the free edges of the composite member. The purpose served by the tape setback method is to strengthen the joints by decoupling stress concentrations from edge defects, which can cause premature failures. A related prior method that serves a similar purpose, involving the use of tapered adherends at the joints, can be too difficult and costly to be acceptable in some applications. The tape setback method offers an easier, less costly alternative. The structural members to which the method was originally applied were box beams {{in the form of}} composite tubes having flat faces with rounded <b>corners.</b> The end <b>fittings</b> were plugs made of a low-thermal- expansion nickel/iron alloy (see figure). In computational-simulation studies of tensile and compressive loading of members without tape setback, stresses were found to be concentrated at the free end edges of the composite tubes, and inspection of members that had been subjected to real tension and compression tests showed that cracks started at the free end edges. As applied to these members, the tape setback method makes them less vulnerable to initiation of failure at edge defects produced during fabrication. In real tension tests of comparable members without and with tape setback, the average mean tensile strength of the members with tape setback was found to be 1. 9 times that of the members without tape setback...|$|R
