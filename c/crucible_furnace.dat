50|$|The quarter {{played an}} {{important}} part in Sheffield's industrial heritage and examples include the cementation furnace on Doncaster Street and the <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> and buildings at 35 Well Meadow Street.|$|E
50|$|There {{is another}} book by Gingery, not usually counted {{as part of}} the series, {{entitled}} Building a Gas Fired <b>Crucible</b> <b>Furnace,</b> which can be substituted for that describing the charcoal foundry.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively {{they could}} be broken up and melted in a {{crucible}} using a <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> with a flux to become crucible steel or cast steel, a process devised by Benjamin Huntsman in Sheffield in the 1740s.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the site}} became largely derelict, {{most of the}} {{buildings}} survived, and it was established that these included the only remaining large complex of <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces,</b> and the only known remains in the United Kingdom of gas fired <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1873 and 1874, {{a further}} range of <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces</b> was added, {{powered by a}} Siemens gas furnace, with its own gas plant adjoining. This {{was one of the}} first in the city, giving the same {{capacity}} as sixty traditional <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{specialised}} furnaces {{are used}} to heat the metal. Furnaces are refractory-lined vessels that contain the material to be melted and provide the energy to melt it. Modern furnace types include electric arc furnaces (EAF), induction furnaces, cupolas, reverberatory, and <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Furnace choice {{is dependent on the}} alloy system quantities produced. For ferrous materials EAFs, cupolas, and induction furnaces are commonly used. Reverberatory and <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces</b> are common for producing aluminium, bronze, and brass castings.|$|R
50|$|Ahlström officially {{divided the}} {{production}} of Karhula-Iittala products in 1937. Iittala glassworks would concentrate on hand-blown glass while Karhula glassworks would take over all automated glass production. The plans which had been around as early as 1933 were delayed because of WW2, though working methods and furnaces’ were modernized anyways in 1937. Some of the changes at the Iittala glassworks included the conversion of a single special <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> and the old 4 <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> into 6 crucibles. An 8 crucible regenerative furnace was also built but the substantially increased output did not {{change the fact that}} all exported Iittala products were still sold under the Karhula brand and within Finland Iittala products were still sold under Karhula-Iittala. After the taking over of the Viiala glassworks by Karhula Oy and Riihimäen Lasi Oy a separate furnace for blowing electric lamps was built, since the employees, {{as part of the deal}} went to the Iittala glassworks.|$|E
50|$|In 1851 {{he set up}} on his own as a file {{manufacturer}} with premises in Broad Lane {{which were}} named Clyde Works. Within 5 years his company expanded and he rented a six - hole <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> on Carver Street in the city centre, whilst only the following year {{he set up a}} tilt and forge in the Philadelphia district of the city, the new site being named Brookhill Works.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{evidence for}} this claim is an Egyptian outpost established in Buhen around 2600 BC to smelt copper ores from Nubia. Alongside this, a <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> for bronze casting was found dating to 2300-1900 BC at the temple precinct at Kerma, however {{the source of the}} tin is unknown. Over the next millennium Nubians developed great skill in working copper and other known metals (Childs and Killick 1993).|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of foundries specialize {{in a particular}} metal and have furnaces dedicated to these metals. For example, an iron foundry (for cast iron) may use a cupola, induction furnace, or EAF, while a steel foundry will use an EAF or induction furnace. Bronze or brass foundries use <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces</b> or induction furnaces. Most aluminium foundries use either electric resistance or gas heated <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces</b> or reverberatory furnaces.|$|R
50|$|The Darnall Works is {{a former}} {{steelworks}} in the Darnall area of Sheffield in England. The only remaining large complex of <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces,</b> the works opened in the 1835 and were frequently extended and adapted until the late 20th century. Some of the structures at the works are listed buildings, at Grade II* and Grade II, {{and part of the}} site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|R
50|$|After the United States entered World War I, munitions and {{supplies}} became the company's top product. The Reading plant operated on 24-hour shifts, producing everything from tool steels to soldiers' safety razor blades. During the war, the company {{put into operation}} 4 new electric-arc furnaces, which allowed greater control over the melting process than the old <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces.</b> In December 1917, the company manufactured its first high-strength, chemical-resistant stainless steel which was immediately used in airplane engine components, cutlery, and spark plugs.|$|R
5000|$|... 35 Well Meadow Street is {{the site}} of a house, {{attached}} workshops, courtyard complex and a <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace.</b> It is located in the St Vincent's Quarter of the City of Sheffield in England, it is also part of the Well Meadow Conservation Area. Despite its current run down state, the buildings and furnace are grade II* listed buildings because of their importance as part of Sheffield’s industrial heritage and it is regarded as, “One of the most significant of the city’s 19th century industrial monuments”.|$|E
50|$|For the {{steelmaking}} process itself, Roach and Salom selected the new Siemens-Martin open hearth process, which {{differed from the}} more well established Bessemer process by being slower and more easily controlled, allowing for a higher quality of finished product. Roach installed a 10-ton Siemens furnace and an 18-pot Siemens <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace,</b> allowing {{for the production of}} 18,000 tons of steel ingots and 3,000 tons of steel castings per annum. The Works, which commenced production on March 1, 1884, was housed in a 160 x 114 foot building and employed a workforce of 70 hands.|$|E
50|$|During the Winter War and the Continuation War, {{part of the}} Second World War, {{production}} {{came to a halt}} due to {{shortages of}} materials and workforce. Production restarted in 1946 and factory modernization was continued by Antero Järvinen and in 1947 a new gas centre and compressed air system was built. The special single <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> was converted into a day tub and the 6 crucible was upgraded to 8 crucibles. Flame cutting was introduced, allowing for cleaner cuts than the cracking method.Järvinen also started to push an agenda to make design more prominent within the Iittala glassworks. This was continued when Håkan Södermaström became the administrator in 1950 and further pushed the Iittala glassworks to apply design to the entire range of products.|$|E

50|$|In August 1815 James Jackson set a {{steelworks}} near Saint-Étienne at Trablaine.Trablaine {{is on the}} Ondaine, in {{the town}} of Le Chambon-Feugerolles. The Trablaine factory started running in 1816.It included carburizing <b>furnaces</b> and <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces</b> for molten steel. The factory produced molten steel {{for the first time in}} France.In August 1818, James Jackson left Trablaine, following a dispute with his partner, which he continued until he filed for bankruptcy in 1821. He moved to Monthieux in 1819 with his sons William, John, James and Charles, and then in 1820 to Rochetaillée and to Soleil, now Saint-Étienne.|$|R
5000|$|Two of the sons, [...] Mark and Thomas junior {{followed}} in father's footsteps and started work at Sanderson Brothers but in 1842 left {{to set up}} their own business in Charlotte Street, Sheffield, their father joining them shortly afterwards. In ten years their business had grown and it was necessary to find larger premises. With land available they moved to a large site in Savile Street, Sheffield, adjacent to the works set up by [...] John Brown. It was named Norfolk Works and had <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces,</b> a file making shop and what was, at the time, the largest rolling mill in Sheffield.|$|R
5000|$|The Well Meadow {{area was}} {{developed}} from farmland, {{starting in the}} early part of the 19th century as the industrial city of Sheffield expanded in boundaries. The original development consisted of back-to-back houses combined with small industrial works. 35 Well Meadow Street dates from around 1840 and was built by the established industrial firm of Samuel Peace. The firm started in 1787 with premises in nearby Scotland Street and had a wide diversity of products such as files, saws, cutlery and scythes. When they opened the 35 Well Meadow Street premises it was as steel and file manufacturers' and iron merchants. The manufacturing process included primary steel production in the <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> and the finishing of the final product in the adjacent workshop.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Torrefaction is {{a thermal}} process that {{improves}} biomass {{performance as a}} fuel by property enhancements such as decreased moisture uptake and increased carbon density. Most studies to date have used very small amounts of finely ground biomass. This study reports the testing of a <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> retort that was fabricated to produce intermediate quantities of torrefied material and to allow processing of wood chips. Yields ranging from 51 to 96 % were impacted {{to a greater extent}} by differences in temperature than time of treatment. Although temperature-control issues (gradients, slow heating) were experienced with the <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> retort, this equipment proved to be useful for its intended purpose...|$|E
5000|$|Sanderson Brothers began {{producing}} {{steel in}} Sheffield, England in 1776. In 1873, it {{was using a}} gas-fired <b>crucible</b> melting <b>furnace.</b> Sanderson sold its Syracuse operation to Crucible, expanding its English company with the purchase of Samuel Newbould and Company.|$|R
5000|$|Kayser Ellison {{merged with}} Sandersons in 1960, forming Sanderson Kayser. A new main {{building}} {{was completed in}} 1967, incorporating a former stock warehouse, and measuring 500 by 59 ft in plan and more than 18 ft high, with a further 200-foot long bay containing the new heat treatment workshop. This building contained several large furnaces, using butane in a first for the city. This allowed many buildings {{to be put to}} new uses: the south-east crucible shops as stores, the heat treatment workshop as a stock grinding plant, and the steel working shop as an annealing and cleaning plant. [...] The gas-fired <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces</b> and the gas plant were demolished, but English Heritage believe that substantial remains of these exist below ground.|$|R

Temperature and {{velocity}} measurements were {{performed in the}} Aluminium melting process in the cold <b>crucible</b> induction <b>furnace.</b> The results of those experimental investigations are compared with the steady-state 2 D calculations based on RNG k-ε model, {{as well as with}} transient 3 D LES modelling predictions...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} few experiments were conducted to study the enhanced heat transfer rate and increased furnace efficiency in a diesel fired <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> with oscillating combustion. The results of experimental investigations of temperature distribution inside the <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> during oscillating combustion are validated with the numerical simulation CFD code. At first pragmatic study of temperature distribution inside a furnace was carried out with conventional mode of combustion at certain conditions and later transient behavior similar to that is conducted with oscillating combustion mode with the same conditions. There found to be enhanced heat transfer rate, reduced processing time and increased furnace efficiency with visibly clean emissions during the oscillating combustion mode than the conventional combustion mode. In the present paper the temperatures inside the furnace at few designated points measured by suitable K type thermo-couples are compared with the CFD code. The geometric models were created in ANSYS and the configuration was an asymmetric one for computational reason. The experimental and numerical investigations produce similar acceptable results. The presented {{results show that the}} 3 D transient model appeared to be an effective numerical tool for the simulation of the <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> for melting processes...|$|E

40|$|This bachelor’s thesis {{focuses on}} thermal {{calculation}} of electric heating device and related theory. Selected topics in electric heating technology are explained, {{followed by the}} calculation in design of a <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> and its automation using a computer program. The theoretical part first deals with the heat transfer mechanisms and their mathematical description. Further on, the thesis describes how heat is created in resistance and induction heating devices and mentions applications {{of these types of}} heating. The main part of the thesis focuses on the thermal calculation of the resistance <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> for aluminium melting. The calculation relates to a cylinder-shaped model of the furnace with determined structure and deals mostly with heat loss, electric power input, thermal efficiency and design of heating elements. The calculation is achieved only in general and it is subsequently automated in Microsoft Office Excel® application. The computer program, which is also a part of the thesis, allows user to change input parameters and see how it affects results of the calculation. In the last chapter, an example of calculation for specific numeric data is presented. The main goal of the thesis is to automate the calculation. That can save some time while calculating and designing a <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace...</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{site was}} already in {{industrial}} use, as the Don Glass Works, which English Heritage believe were probably already established in 1793, centred on a glass cone. The Sanderson Brothers were able to acquire the site on a 21-year lease for £13/13/0 annual rent. As part of this, it appears that they took over the glassworks, where possible learning technological advances in one industry to develop the other, and perhaps adapting the glass cone into a cementation furnace. Both cementation and <b>crucible</b> <b>furnaces</b> were definitely in use, but the glassworks was sold off during the 1850s to Melling, Carr and Co, who operated it until {{the start of the}} 20th century. Although the glassworks then closed, and there are no above-ground remains, English Heritage consider it likely that there are significant underground structures, along with discarded glass, and this forms part of the justification for the listing of the site as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{is focused on}} studying the density and mechanical properties of iron-chromium composites consolidated by innovative rapid microwave sintering technology against conventionally sintered counterparts using slow heating <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace.</b> Another {{aim of this study}} is to assess the viability of yttria (Y 2 O 3) ceramic particulates as reinforcement to the iron-chromium composites. Fabrication of iron-chromium-yttria composites consolidated in microwave furnace and conventional <b>crucible</b> <b>furnace</b> was successfully accomplished. Improvement of density is evident in microwave sintered composites. The Y 2 O 3 addition significantly increases the hardness of the composite (118 Hv for microwave specimens as opposed to 110 Hv for conventional specimens).
