40|$|Pigeons {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} intramuscular injections of 5. 6 mg/kg BMY 14802, a drug that has relatively high affinity for sigma binding sites, from saline in a two-key operant proce-dure. Many compounds that displace sigma binding failed to produce BMY 14802 -like discriminative stimulus effects; these included (1) -SKF 10, 047, (1) 3 -PPP, DTG and MR 2035; the typical antipsychotic haloperidol; the putative antipsychotics tiospirone, <b>cinuperone</b> and rimcazole; and the uncompetitive NMDA antagonist phencyclidine. In addition, MR 2035 and tiosperone failed to antagonize the discriminative stimulus ef-fects of BMY 14802. The selective D 2 antagonist eticlopride and the norepinephrine uptake blocker and antidepressant desmethylimipramine also failed to evoke substantial BMY 14802 -appropriate responding. In contrast to sigma ligand...|$|E
