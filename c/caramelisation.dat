50|$|Copper is the {{traditional}} material for the boiling vessel, because copper transfers heat quickly and evenly, and because the bubbles produced during boiling, and which would act as an insulator against the heat, do not cling {{to the surface of}} copper, so the wort is heated in a consistent manner. The simplest boil kettles are direct-fired, with a burner underneath. These can produce a vigorous and favourable boil, but are also apt to scorch the wort where the flame touches the kettle, causing <b>caramelisation</b> and making cleanup difficult. Most breweries use a steam-fired kettle, which uses steam jackets in the kettle to boil the wort. Breweries usually have a boiling unit either inside or outside of the kettle, usually a tall, thin cylinder with vertical tubes, called a calandria, through which wort is pumped.|$|E

This modelling technique uses information of reactants and products involved, allowing insightful kinetic parameters estimation and helping in clarifying reaction mechanisms. One example of a complex reaction that occurs in food processing is the <b>caramelisation</b> reaction. <b>Caramelisation</b> is the common name for a group of reactions observed when carbohydrates are exposed to high temperatures. The objective of this work was to apply multiresponse regression in developing a mathematical mechanistic model that describes sucrose thermal degradation and <b>caramelisation</b> products formation in highly concentrated sucrose solutions, with different water contents and under various temperatures. Results demonstrated the usefulness of multiresponse modelling in understanding reaction mechanisms in food matrices. A mechanistic model for the <b>caramelisation</b> reaction was proposed, which successfully described the experimental data of concentrated solutions in the 30. 03 to 12. 20 % (w/w) water content range.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of sugar type on the reaction mechanism for formation of acrylamide and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) during the baking of biscuits at 200 °C using multiresponse modelling. Four types of biscuits were prepared: (1) with sucrose, (2) with glucose and fructose, (3) with fructose only and (4) with glucose only. Experimental data showed that HMF concentration was highest in biscuits with glucose and fructose, whereas acrylamide concentration was highest in biscuits with glucose, also having the highest asparagine concentration. Proposed mechanistic models suggested that HMF is formed via <b>caramelisation</b> and that acrylamide formation follows the specific amino acid route, i. e., reducing sugars react with asparagine to form the Schiff base before decarboxylation, to generate acrylamide without the Amadori rearrangement product and sugar fragmentation.

40|$|Consumers place a {{high level}} of {{importance}} on flavour when assessing the acceptability of food. The flavour of dairy products can be affected by heating both during processing and by consumers during food preparation. Of particular importance to the flavour of heated dairy products is the highly complex network of Maillard reactions. Previously, emphasis has been placed on undesirable flavours generated through the Maillard reaction in dairy products and efforts have been made to minimise the formation of these flavours. However, beneficial flavours are also formed by the Maillard reaction. Dairy products such as ghee are formed by heating and are characterised by their unique flavours; these flavours are generated by the Maillard reaction. The objective of this thesis was to unravel the factors that influence the Maillard and <b>caramelisation</b> reactions that occur during the cooking of ghee. Particular focus was placed on the impact that the structure of the cream had on the reaction, and how manipulation of these parameters could provide an avenue for the control of the Maillard reaction. The development and validation of model reaction systems for the Maillard and <b>caramelisation</b> reactions involved the variation of parameters including cooking time, temperature, pH, phosphate buffers and salt. A group of eleven compounds including acetic acid, furfural, 2 -acetylfuran, butyrolactone, 2 (5 H) -furanone, furfuryl alcohol, maltol, 2 - acetylpyrrole, hydroxymaltol, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and dihydro- 4 -hydroxy- 2 (3 H) - furanone (DHHF) were monitored to determine the impact of these parameter changes. These results provided a starting point {{to assess the impact of}} food structure on these reactions. To assess the impact of food structure a series of matrix structures were designed starting from an aqueous matrix. The first component that was added to the aqueous matrix was fat to generate a two phase structure. Emulsion structures were then formed from the two phase structure using emulsifiers and high pressure homogenisation. Analysis of the volatile compounds formed as the matrix structures were altered was carried out using headspace solid phase microextraction/ gas chromatography mass spectrometry (SPME/GCMS). Results indicated that fat is a key structural component in flavour generation via the Maillard reaction. This could have implications for low fat foods where the flavour developed during cooking is important. The addition of fat indicated a significant impact on the Maillard reaction with a less significant impact seen on the <b>caramelisation</b> reaction. The formation of two emulsions with inverted structures provided a means to alter the ratio of volatile compounds in the cooked samples. The oil in water emulsion generated a volatile compound profile similar to that of the fat containing matrix, whereas the water in oil emulsion produced a different ratio of these same compounds. The results reported in this thesis shed some light on the relationship between food structure and flavour formation during the cooking of milk fat emulsions. These structures will create future opportunities to manipulate the structure of food to control flavour formation...|$|E

Free and total (free + linked to the protein backbone) fluorescence (FIC) due to Maillard compounds in 60 commercial breakfast cereals was evaluated. Pronase was used for efficient release of linked fluorescent Maillard compounds from the protein backbone. Results were correlated with some heat-induced markers {{of the extent of}} the MR or sugar <b>caramelisation</b> during cereal processing, such as hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural, glucosilisomaltol and furosine. The effect of sample composition (dietary-fibre added, protein, etc.) on levels of FIC, expressed as fluorescence intensity (FI) per milligram of sample, is discussed. FIC is significantly correlated to the protein content of the sample and fluorescent Maillard compounds are mainly linked to the protein backbone.

The aim of this work was to evaluate {{the influence of the}} coffee/water ratio on the physico-chemical and sensory quality of espresso coffee. Furthermore, the influence of botanical varieties (Arabica and Robusta) and the type of roast (conventional and torrefacto) on the selection of coffee/water ratio was studied. The relationship between pH and the perception of acidity intensity is discussed in relation to the influence of the coffee/water ratio, type of coffee and roast. The optimisation of other technical parameters in previous studies seemed to minimise the influence of an increase in the coffee/water ratio on the extraction of soluble and solid compounds. In fact, only some sensory attributes, such as bitterness, astringency and burnt, acrid and earthy/musty flavours were proposed as relevant to the selection of 6. 5 g 40 mL(- 1) or 7. 5 g 40 mL(- 1) in conventional roasted coffees (Arabica 100 % and Robusta blend), and 6. 5 g 40 mL(- 1) in torrefacto roasted coffees.

40|$|AbstractStructural {{sections}} of laminated bamboo can be connected using methods common in timber engineering, however the different material properties of timber and laminated bamboo {{suggest that the}} behaviour of connections in the two materials {{would not be the}} same. This study investigates the dowelled connection, in which a connector is passed {{through a hole in the}} material, and load is resisted by shear in the connector and embedment into the surrounding material. Steel dowels were used in a connection between a laminated bamboo member and a steel plate in a central slot in the bamboo, and the behaviour of this connection was compared with a similar connection in timber. The laminated bamboo was made from Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) which had been treated by one of two preservative processes, either bleaching or <b>caramelisation.</b> Following testing, substantial qualitative differences between the bamboo and timber specimens were observed: the bamboo failed most often by the formation of a shear plug whereas the timber failed by a single split. The two preservative treatments resulted in different behaviour: the bleached bamboo had a degree of ductility roughly twice that of the caramelised bamboo. Digital image correlation provided full-field strain measurements, which gave further insight into the differences between the materials, particularly between bamboo and timber. Shear strain is dominant in the bamboo, compared with tensile strain perpendicular to grain in the timber. Numerical modelling showed that this difference in the strain field could be explained by the different orthotropic elastic and frictional properties of the two materials...|$|E
40|$|Many of {{our food}} {{products}} have undergone a heat-treatment before consumption, either {{at home or}} at the food industry. Heat treatments not only bring out desired characteristics of the food products such as flavour, texture, taste and safety aspects but also leads {{to the formation of}} undesired compounds that may have negative impacts for human health. Such undesired compounds that are generated from the Maillard reaction are neo-formed food contaminants (NFC). NFC are present in many common heat-processed foods, such as potatoes-based products, cereal-based products, baby foods, and dairy products. Therefore, effective mitigation measures are being developed to minimize the generation of such undesired compounds while maintaining the organoleptic attributes of the food products as consumer’s demands. This thesis aimed at understanding the mechanistic pathways for the formation of three neo-formed food contaminants: acrylamide, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and NƐ-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), using multireponse kinetic modelling. First, the topic of the Maillard reaction, occurrence and human exposure to the three NFC in heated foods, and multiresponse kinetic modelling is introduced. Then, scientific literature on analytical methods, formation pathways, occurrence in processed foods, and health impacts of CML was reviewed. Based on the literature, an experiment was set up to understand the formation pathway for CML in caseinate-lactose/glucose solutions, each heated at 120 oC and 130 oC. According to the best fitting mechanistic model, the formation of CML in the two model solutions originated from the reaction between lactose/glucose and lysine residues via the Amadori rearrangement product formation. Moreover, glucose and lactose were degraded via Lobry de Bruyn-Alberda van Ekenstein (LA) arrangement. CML seems to be not thermally stable, and may thus not be an optimal indicator for heat damage of foods. Another experiment was done for gaining insights into the formation of acrylamide and HMF in biscuits during baking at 200 oC. Four biscuit recipes were prepared with three sugar types: (1) sucrose (35 g), (2) glucose (17. 5 g) and fructose (17. 5 g), (3) fructose (17. 5 g), and (4) glucose. The molar ratio of total glucose and fructose to asparagine in each type of biscuit was higher than 1. The concentrations of acrylamide and HMF were lowest in the sucrose-prepared biscuits. Kinetic modelling results suggested that during baking of these four kinds of biscuits, acrylamide was formed via the specific amino acid route, i. e., a reducing sugar reacts with asparagine to form the Schiff base without the Amadori product formation (not via Strecker degradation), and that HMF was formed via <b>caramelisation.</b> Fructose {{played a key role in}} the formation of both acrylamide and HMF. In a similar experiment, the effects of different types of wheat flour on acrylamide and HMF formation in sucrose-prepared biscuits during baking at 200 oC were investigated. Four types of wheat flour, which had the most different concentrations of asparagine, and total glucose and fructose (the reducing sugar), were selected for the preparation of four kinds of biscuits. Out of four wheat flour types, two had the molar ratio of reducing sugars to asparagine lower than 1, and the other two had a ratio higher than 1. Results showed that those different molar ratios in wheat flour did not have effects on the pathways leading to the formation of acrylamide and HMF in all four types of biscuits. Acrylamide was formed via the specific amino acid route, and HMF was formed via <b>caramelisation.</b> No clear correlation was found between the concentration of either acrylamide or HMF in biscuits and the concentration of asparagine or the reducing sugars in wheat flour. Asparagine was not a limiting factor for acrylamide generation in biscuits.      The outcomes of this thesis give insights into the actual reaction pathways for the formation of acrylamide and HMF in biscuits during baking at 200 oC and for the formation of CML in the model solutions. These modelling results may help to control the formation of these NFCs in a quantitative way.   ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Pilsner malt, one of {{the main}} {{ingredients}} for the production of beer, is made in a three-step production process which involves subsequent steeping, germination and kilning. Compared to pilsner malt, dark specialty malts are produced at higher temperatures. Depending on the applied drying procedure, dark specialty malts canbe further divided in colour, caramel and roasted malts. In that respect, colour malts are produced in a kiln at higher temperatures compared to pilsner malt, whereas caramel and roasted malts are manufactured in a roasting drum. The elevated temperatures applied during kilning and roasting intensify the non-enzymatic browning reactions, resulting in the formation of colour, flavour and antioxidant components. As the extent of these reactions is influenced by the reaction conditions, the presence and concentration of the previously mentioned compounds in dark specialtymalts depend on the applied processing parameters. When used for the production of beers, these malts can {{have a significant impact on}} the characteristics of the end product. In this research, the main objectives were to identify and characterise flavour components in different types of dark specialty malts and to elucidate the influence of the applied processing parameters on the development of flavour, colour and antioxidant power in caramel malts. Moreover, the evolution of dark specialtymalt flavour components during wort boiling and the influence of these malts on the flavour stability of beer was studied. First, headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography and massspectrometry was used to characterise the volatile fraction of aqueous extracts and dry ground samples of different colour, caramel and roastedmalts. Following this procedure, more than 100 compounds could be identified including oxygen-, nitrogen- and sulphur containing heterocyclic components. Since caramel-like furanones and pyranones could only be extracted out of a dry matrix, an extraction technique was optimised to determine these components in dry ground malts. These results revealed that the malt type, and as a consequence the production process, had an important influence on the presence of components. In that respect, caramel-like flavour components such as maltol and furaneol proved to be present in the highest concentrations in caramel malts, whereas greatest amountsof the roasted-like pyrazines were found in roasted malts. In addition,no clear relationship between the malt colour and the concentration of flavour components could be established. Besides flavour components, malt characteristics such as moisture content, extract content and pH also mainly depended on the type of dark specialty malt. The influence of the time and temperature of the roasting process on the development of malt characteristics was studied during the production of caramel malt. This process comprises an initial saccharification step and a subsequent <b>caramelisation</b> step. During the first phase, the optimal formationof the reducing sugars, glucose and maltose, and free amino acids was closely related to the optimal temperatures of activity of the involved enzymes. As expected, it became clear that the time and temperature of the latter phase had an important influence on the evolution of several malt characteristics such as the moisture content, extract, pH, colour andreducing power. The development of important flavour components was highly influenced by the roasting temperature and the moisture content of the malt kernels. Moreover, the obtained results indicated that flavour development was not linked to the colour formation. The use of darkspecialty malts in the grist proved to have a significant impact on thecolour and the presence of flavour components in the sweet wort. Boiling, however, resulted in an increase of the wort colour and the TBA value, which depended on the used dark specialty malt type. Although a part of the flavour components present in the sweet wort evaporated during boiling, pyrazines proved to be present in a considerable amount in the boiled wort. Branched- 2 -alkenals, however, evaporated almost completely outof the wort, whereas β-damascenone accumulated. If unaltered during fermentation, these components can possibly contribute to the global beer flavour. In a last chapter, the influence of dark specialty malts on the beer flavour stability was studied. On the one hand, these results indicated no significant difference in global appreciation betweenboth fresh beers. On the other hand, a cocoa, caramel flavour was ascribed to the fresh caramel malt beer, whereas marzipan, bread-like flavours characterised the colour malt beer. After thermally forced ageing, caramel and fruity flavours decreased, whereas cardboard and ribes notes increased. The analytical results showed that the concentration of severalknown staling markers increased during ageing. However, few of these components were likely to contribute to the global flavour due to their high flavour thresholds. In conclusion, this work provides new insights in the presence of flavour components in different types of dark specialty malts and the development of these compounds together with some important malt characteristics during the production process of caramel malts. Finally, a light was shed on the behaviour of dark specialty malts during the brewing process and their influence on the flavour stability of beer.

40|$|Prune is an {{important}} product in the dried fruit industry. The production of prunes involves drying of high-moisture fresh plums. Drying is an energy intensive food processing operation, which {{plays a significant role}} {{on the quality of the}} product. Increased competition in today 2 ̆ 7 s global market means that avenues to improve the process efficiency and product quality are desirable. In order to do this it is important to understand the physical and chemical changes occurring during drying. Comprehensive physico-chemical investigations of the drying process of plums were conducted. This would help to establish a scientific basis for suggesting improvements to the commercial dehydration of plums with a view of maintaining or enhancing the quality of the dried product. A computer-based laboratory drier was designed and built to study the kinetics of drying plums under controlled conditions. The effects of the process parameters (i. e., temperature, relative humidity and velocity) on the kinetics of moisture loss were studied to ascertain the major factors controlling the rate of drying plums. Results of the study showed a remarkable influence of the process parameters demonstrating the need for better control of the conditions of the drying air. These together with the ancillary experiments revealed that there may be different rate-controlling mechanisms involved during drying implicating {{an important}} role of the skin layer to moisture transfer. Notable differences between the drying curves of plums dried without skin and those with skin intact corroborated the importance of the skin layer to the drying process. Modelling the drying process has also provided more insight into the mechanisms of mass transfer during drying under different conditions. The proposed models predicted well the drying curves and could serve as descriptive tools in predicting the drying process of plums. This is important for the optimisation process. In addition, the study of using chemical pretreatment based on fatty acid esters further disclosed the significant effects of the skin layer to moisture loss during drying. It showed that dipping pretreatment can be employed to enhance the drying process of plums depending upon the composition of the drying emulsions and the drying conditions. The approach of monitoring the kinetics of changes in the carbohydrate constituents of plums using HPLC has shown dramatic alterations in the amounts of the major carbohydrates present in plums (i. e., fructose, sorbitol, glucose and sucrose) during drying and storage. It unveiled the major carbohydrate degradations occurring during drying including the hydrolysis of sucrose, Maillard reactions and <b>caramelisation.</b> Drying conditions and the pH of the fruit were found to affect the rate and onset of these reactions. The study shows the usefulness of the approach in detecting the progress of the chemical degradation reactions and further manifests the importance of controlling the conditions during drying of plums. It is known that the decomposition of carbohydrates would lead to the generation of wide spectrum of volatile flavours depending upon the type of reaction. A solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique in conjunction with GC-MS was used to characterise and follow the changes of volatile flavours during drying of plums. The study of aroma profiling showed significant changes to the volatile constituents of plums during drying identifying relevant routes leading to the formation of the volatile flavours associated with the carbohydrate degradations. The result demonstrates the importance of aroma profiling in diagnosing further the progress of the chemical degradation reactions, which has important implications for the control of the quality of the product. The impetus of controlling the drying process manifests the need for better knowledge of the conditions in which the fruits are experiencing during commercial dehydration. This information is also important for simulating the commercial drying conditions in laboratory studies. In this respect, a computer-based data acquisition system was developed to monitor the conditions during commercial dehydration of prunes. The monitoring work was found to be useful in identifying anomalies in drying conditions in the tunnel exemplifying the utility of the device in assessing the performance of the tunnel...|$|E

Carbohydrate Research, 83, 263 - 272. Sugars undergo <b>caramelisation</b> reactions at relatively high temperatures but when amino compounds are present, Maillard browning reactions are possible and these occur under less severe conditions. The reaction {{conditions and the}} basic character of the amino compounds determine the range of flavour compounds formed. The first step during Maillard browning is the condensation of a reducing sugar with an amine to form a glycosylamine and this compound may then undergo the Amadori rearrangement to form a 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketose. The pyrolysis of two 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketoses (1 -deoxy- 1 -glycino-D-fructose and 1 -β-alanino- 1 -deoxy-D-fructose) was studied in this investigation to examine their participation in a low energy route to aroma formation. Thermal analysis and parallel chemical investigations showed that the formation of these Amadori compounds facilitates the thermal degradation of their sugar and amino acid moieties. In addition increased quantities of various aroma compounds are produced, compared with the controls. In particular, the toxic compound protoanemonin is formed and a degradation pathway leading to its production is proposed. Most of the work involving the elucidation of degradation pathways during Maillard browning have involved studies in aqueous systems. Browning reactions between glucose and amino acids were also observed during heating in the dry-state in this study. These reactions are very vigorous once initiated and this precluded the study of a glucose plus amino acid control by the techniques used to study the pyrolysis of the 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketoses. Such reactions occur at temperatures below those required for the thermal degradation of the corresponding Amadori rearrangement compound thus questioning the involvement of these compounds in the lowest energy thermolysis pathway in the absence of moisture. The results of experiments designed to investigate the role of Amadori compounds during the browning of sugar-amino acid systems in the dry-state demonstrated however that the reactions reported to occur in aqueous systems can also account for the dry-state processes at temperatures up until the spontaneous decomposition of the 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketose can occur. That the 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketose does not brown by itself or in the presence of glucose as readily as a glucose plus amino acid system is presumably a basicity effect. The stronger base (the amino acid) may promote a solid-state enolisation of the glucose and hence initiate browning at a somewhat lower temperature. The results of these experiments also demonstrate the stability of the 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketoses and show that their formation is not a rate-limiting step during browning. In the third section of this thesis the effect of changing the amine moiety on the degradation pattern of 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketoses is assessed. Previous research has indicated that glucose by itself and Amadori compounds formed from weak primary bases degrade via an initial 1, 2 enolisation step to form mainly 2 -furaldehydes and pyrrole derivatives while 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketoses containing a strong basic moiety (usually formed from a secondary base) degrade via a 2, 3 enol intermediate and give rise to fragrant caramel aroma compounds. Several 1 -amino- 1 -deoxy-ketoses were prepared using primary and secondary bases covering a range of pkb values. These compounds were pyrolysed and their decomposition characteristics monitored by thermal analysis methods. Parallel analysis of the volatiles produced and a comparison of the results from previous investigations generally endorsed the reported hypotheses on the degradation of Amadori compounds. It was found that the structure of the base and functional groups present influenced the degradation phenomena as well as the basicity. The thermal decomposition of amino acid - derived Amadori compounds for instance, did not fit into the pattern of that observed for 1 -amino- 1 -deoxyketoses derived from other bases. The amino acid influences the degradation traits by promoting 1, 2 enolisation and charring rather than aiding 2, 3 enolisation similar to bases of comparable pkb...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of this project, acidic, basic, metal, and photo {{catalysts}} were applied to carbohydrate melts. We aimed to find chemical reactions converting carbohydrates in a selective and efficient way into fine chemicals in this screening process. The present study revealed that under basic conditions carbohydrates isomerise via well-known keto-enediol intermediates which are in equilibrium. Besides, observed decomposition reactions were also unselective. The addition of amines led to random Maillard products. <b>Caramelisation</b> products occurred constantly, especially at high temperatures. Furthermore, we could show that carbohydrates were not converted by applying metal catalysis, with the focus on oxidation reactions, or photo catalysis. Often, glucosylurea was formed during the reaction. Acid catalysed reactions provided the most promising results. In choline chloride melts, acids catalyse the elimination of water molecules which leads to furfural derivatives, important organic platform chemicals. We illustrated the synthesis of 5 -hydroxmethylfurfural (5 -HMF) from L-sorbose and 5 -(α-D-glucosyloxymethyl) furfural (GMF) from isomaltulose. In general, glycosylureas are produced in sugar-urea melts from different aldohexoses as well as from ketohexoses under acidic conditions. They are remarkably stable and are stereoselectively formed in high yields and short reaction times. Slightly acidic conditions are sufficient to make them the preferred product. Thus, we could improve existing syntheses of glycosylureas by implementing a method using environmentally benign bulk chemicals without the need of a solvent. Accordingly, reactions times were reduced and yields were increased. Summing up, we concluded that sugars show similar reaction behaviour in melts as in solution. Aggressive growth accompanied by rapid metastasis makes the malignant melanoma a kind of cancer with a low rate of survival in an advanced stage. The melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) protein reduces the cell contacts to the extracellular matrix and facilitates metastasis. Remarkably, MIA protein is exclusively expressed in malignant melanoma cells and chondrocytes. In comparison to other chemotherapeutic agents, anti metastatic agents (substances which inhibit the functional activity of MIA protein) would thus prevent the spreading of these cells and reduce the side effects of systemic chemotherapy dramatically. MIA protein is functionally active after formation of dimers. Small compounds which prevent this assembly would be very interesting drugs in the treatment of cancer. Short peptides consisting of three to eighteen amino acids were assessed in a screening process to inhibit the dimerisation of MIA protein in vitro and in vivo. The major drawback of proteins and peptides as drugs is their poor in vivo stability and the resulting low plasma concentration which is often below the effective dose. Currently, the poor pharmacokinetic properties of proteins often require daily injections which entail high costs and are a burden to the treated patients. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to increase the in vivo stability of MIA inhibiting peptides and thus to achieve adequate drug levels in plasma. It was attempted to achieve this goal by simple modifications of the molecular structure of the known inhibitors, with the focus on modifications of the peptide backbone. The synthesised peptide mimetics were methylated at the nitrogen atom of the amide bond of the peptide chain, transformed to N-substituted glycines (peptoids), or cyclised in a head-to-tail fashion. Subsequent in vitro tests (HTFP assay, Western Blot analysis) of the derivatives showed that their activity was significantly reduced in comparison to the original compounds. This was attributed to a conformational change of the mimics due to variations in the chemical structure. The results implicate that their conformation differs strongly from the bioactive conformation, thus reducing the potency. As the structural variation of lead compounds is often connected with the risk of losing activity, a second approach was pursued. By applying drug delivery systems the molecular structure can be retained. Furthermore, these devices should ideally release a drug selectively at the site of action over a predetermined period of time. Consequently, a constant plasma concentration might be maintained leading to a reduced frequency of application and overall in an improved therapy. Covalent attachment of polymers like poly(ethylene glycol) is a convenient method to increase the circulation time by reducing the rate of renal and hepatic clearance and metabolic degradation of the drugs. PEGylation of small MIA inhibitors led to highly active compounds, as in vitro tests showed. Future experiments will have to elucidate their pharmacokinetic properties. Sustained release devices are also suitable alternatives to reduce the drug administration frequency. A new formulation of biocompatible triglyceride implants released the incorporated peptide almost completely within 24 hours which provided no improvement over the current application method. For this reason, highly biocompatible PEG hydrogels were applied as slow-releasing matrices. The applicability of hydrogels in sustained release systems is still limited as incorporated compounds are rapidly released. It was observed that the incorporated model peptide was released within five days from PEG hydrogels. In conclusion, first steps to increase the in vivo stability of MIA inhibitors by different approaches have been made within the scope of this thesis. Certainly, many experiments will still be necessary in order to obtain a marketable product for the treatment of malignant melanoma. First steps {{have been made in the}} challenging field of peptide delivery. The knowledge attained in this work contributes significantly to future work of optimising the molecular structure of the drug or the drug carrier system. ...|$|E
