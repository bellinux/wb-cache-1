50|$|The spatial {{location}} of the B5 station itself is stated as “Grid Epsilon coordinates: 470/18/22.” This came about because Straczynski was touched by an outpouring {{of support from the}} GEnie Science Fiction and Fantasy RoundTable (SFRT) community in regards to a potential letter-writing campaign that {{turned out not to be}} needed after all. He was still grateful, however, and asked how he could show his appreciation. An SFRT participant suggested placing the station at the 3D spatial coordinates corresponding to the GEnie Page (#470, for original SFRT), CATegory (#18, for Non-Trek SFTV Series), and TOPic (#22, for Babylon 5) of the then-only official B5 Topic on GEnie (the strange capitalization of CATegory and TOPic refers to the fact that GEnie was command-line-based and allowed commands to be abbreviated to three letters). Straczynski agreed and added that info to the series bible used by episode writers. The “Grid Epsilon” part was his own touch, based on the first two initials (which were usually both <b>capitalized)</b> <b>of</b> GEnie itself it was originally a GE (General Electric).|$|E

Results show that the removal efficiency were (93. 95, 97. 18 and 95. 26) % for heavy metal (Mg, Mn and Mo) respectively from aquatic solution decreased with increasing of initial concentration and flow rate while the removal efficiency increased with increasing absorbance material bed height, pH and feeding temperature. Statistical model is achieved to find an expression relates the overall operating parameters with the removal efficiency for each metal ions used in this investigation in a general equation (each one alone).

Different benefits possess which are: remove the three toxic heavy metals ions contaminated the water, get rid of agricultural waste (IRH), in the same time, produce light and more benefit hydrocarbons from n-heptane isomerization using a type Y-zeolite catalyst synthesis from remaining (IRH) and prepare a cheap and active rodenticide...|$|E
