5|$|Rothenberg's {{legacy is}} not only the generations of {{scholars}} he prepared, but also his vast historiographical <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> the Revolutionary era. For many years, his Army of Francis Joseph (1976) was the standard and the only English language analysis of the Habsburg Army in the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic wars. He changed the widespread perception of Archduke Charles' military acumen. A masterful historian, Rothenberg was known furthermore as an eminently fair scholar. After publishing a critique of a publication, the author contacted him, and proved the critique unjust; Rothenberg immediately wrote to a review retracting the criticism, and the two scholars remained friends for the remainder of his life.|$|E

500|$|Goffman is {{sometimes}} credited with having in 1957 {{coined the term}} [...] "total institution", though Fine and Manning note {{that he had heard}} it in lectures by Everett Hughes in reference to any type of institution in which people are treated alike and in which behavior is regulated. Regardless of whether Goffman coined the term [...] "total institution", he popularized it with his 1961 book, Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates. The book has been described as [...] "ethnography of the concept of the total institution". [...] The book {{was one of the first}} sociological examinations of the social situation of mental patients in psychiatric hospitals and a major <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> of social aspects of mental illness.|$|E

500|$|While imprisoned, Kemper {{has participated}} {{in a number of}} interviews, {{including}} a segment in the 1982 documentary The Killing of America, as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary Murder: No Apparent Motive. His interviews are notable for their <b>contribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>understanding</b> the mind of serial killers, with FBI profiler John E. Douglas describing Kemper as [...] "among the brightest prison inmates" [...] he ever interviewed and capable of [...] "rare insight for a violent criminal." [...] Kemper is also forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has said that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; stating {{at the end of his}} Murder: No Apparent Motive interview: [...] "There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing, it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts." [...] He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.|$|E
