In Israel, families that do not kasher their ovens can bake cakes, casseroles, and even meat on the stovetop in a Wonder Pot, an Israeli invention consisting of three parts: an aluminium pot shaped like a Bundt pan, a hooded cover perforated with venting holes, and a thick, round, metal disc with a <b>center</b> <b>hole</b> which is placed between the Wonder Pot and the flame to disperse heat.|$|E
25|$|Unwilling {{to accept}} and license Columbia's system, in February 1949 RCA Victor, in {{cooperation}} with its parent, the Radio Corporation of America, released the first 45rpm single, 7inches in diameter with a large <b>center</b> <b>hole.</b> The 45rpm player included a changing mechanism that allowed multiple disks to be stacked, much as a conventional changer handled 78s. The short playing time of a single 45rpm side meant that long works, such as symphonies, had to be released on multiple 45s instead of a single LP, but RCA claimed that the new high-speed changer rendered side breaks so brief as to be inaudible or inconsequential. Early 45rpm records were made from either vinyl or polystyrene. They had a playing time of eight minutes.|$|E

25|$|The 45rpm discs {{also came}} in a variety known as {{extended}} play (EP), which achieved up to 10–15 minutes play {{at the expense of}} attenuating (and possibly compressing) the sound to reduce the width required by the groove. EP discs were cheaper to produce, and were used in cases where unit sales were likely to be more limited or to reissue LP albums on the smaller format for those people who had only 45rpm players. LP albums could be purchased one EP at a time, with four items per EP, or in a boxed set with three EPs or twelve items. The large <b>center</b> <b>hole</b> on 45s allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms. EPs were generally discontinued by the late 1950s in the U.S. as three- and four-speed record players replaced the individual 45 players. One indication of the decline of the 45rpm EP is that the last Columbia Records reissue of Frank Sinatra songs on 45rpm EP records, called Frank Sinatra (Columbia B-2641) was issued on December 7, 1959. The EP lasted considerably longer in Europe, and was a popular format during the 1960s for recordings by artists such as Serge Gainsbourg and the Beatles.|$|E

2500|$|Replicated CDs are mass-produced {{initially}} using {{a hydraulic}} press. Small granules of heated raw polycarbonate plastic are {{fed into the}} press.

2500|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} through the 1960s, in the U.S. the common home record player or [...] "stereo" [...] (after the {{introduction}} of stereo recording) would typically have had these features: a three- or four-speed player (78, 45, , and sometimes rpm); with changer, a tall spindle that would hold several records and automatically drop a new record {{on top of the}} previous one when it had finished playing, a combination cartridge with both 78 and microgroove styli and a way to flip between the two; and some kind of adapter for playing the 45s with their larger <b>center</b> <b>hole.</b> The adapter could be a small solid circle that fit onto the bottom of the spindle (meaning only one 45 could be played at a time) or a larger adaptor that fit over the entire spindle, permitting a stack of 45s to be played.|$|E

2500|$|Terms such as [...] "long-play" [...] (LP) and [...] "extended-play" [...] (EP) {{describe}} multi-track {{records that}} play {{much longer than}} the single-item-per-side records, which typically do not go much past four minutes per side. An LP can play for up to 30 minutes per side, though most played for about 22 minutes per side, bringing the total playing time of a typical LP recording to about forty-five minutes. Many pre-1952 LPs, however, played for about 15 minutes per side. The 7-inch 45rpm format normally contains one item per side but a 7-inch EP could achieve recording times of 10 to 15 minutes {{at the expense of}} attenuating and compressing the sound to reduce the width required by the groove. EP discs were generally used to make available tracks not on singles including tracks on LPs albums in a smaller, less expensive format for those who had only 45rpm players. The large <b>center</b> <b>hole</b> on 7-inch 45rpm records allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms. The term [...] "album", originally used to mean a [...] "book" [...] with liner notes, holding several 78rpm records each in its own [...] "page" [...] or sleeve, no longer has any relation to the physical format: a single LP record, or nowadays more typically a compact disc.|$|E

40|$|Each of {{two parts}} has K {{coordination}} holes with the intent that each hole on one part is paired and to be pinned with a corresponding hole on the other part. While the nominal <b>hole</b> <b>centers</b> for each <b>hole</b> pair are identical, the actual <b>hole</b> <b>centers</b> will deviate from their nominal values in some random fashion reflecting the inherent <b>hole</b> <b>centering</b> accuracy of the drilling process.
