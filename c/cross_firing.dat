500|$|Two years later, Byrd hired Jim Tatum as {{football}} coach. The year prior at Oklahoma, Tatum fielded {{a winning}} team, but {{the athletic department}} ran up a huge deficit and some players were paid in violation of conference rules, which resulted in university president George <b>Cross</b> <b>firing</b> athletic director Jap Haskell. The media blamed Tatum for his termination. Tatum told Cross to refute Tatum's role in the matter, and threatened to reveal the Oklahoma team had been paid $6,000 after the 1947 Gator Bowl. Cross asked Byrd to persuade Tatum not to go public, and according to author Gary King in An Autumn Remembered, Byrd replied, [...] "Persuade, hell! I'll tell {{him to keep his}} damn mouth shut!" [...] Tatum remained as coach at Maryland from 1947 to 1955, and amassed a 73–15–4 record.|$|E
50|$|Bengali troops lacked proper {{communication}} equipment for co-ordinating {{an attack on}} Saidpur and although Indian authorities had been contacted for help, none had been received. Pakistani troops, reinforced through the air after the capture of Lalmunirhut, began to attack Bengali positions from 6 April onwards. Task forces were created from the 26 FF, 48 Punjab and 4 FF battalions, accompanied by a squadron/troop from the 29 cavalry and artillery pieces from the 23rd Field regiment, several Pakistani infantry columns backed by air support begun to attack Bengali positions simultaneously from 4 April. Bhushibandar was taken on 5 April, Parvatipur was taken on 6 April, Nilphamari was unsuccessfully attacked the same day. 3 EBR troops attacking Parvatipur from Phulbai {{on the same day}} met with bloody repulse and retreated to Phulbari. Pakistani troops attacked Nilphamari on 7 April, Bengali troops left the town the same day and Pakistanis took the town the following day. By 10 April, Pakistani troops were poised to attack Bengali positions at T-Junction to the west of Bhushibandar, and areas to the west of Nilphamari and south of Parvatipur. By 27 April the division was secured, and the area north of the Tista river was retaken by Mid May. But in securing the division, 26 FF, the same regiment that had the maximum casualties later on till surrender of Pakistan Army, lost a very valuable resource on 1 May. Capt. Mujahid who was at the flank along with three soldiers and his CO, Lt Col Hakeem was attacked by the 3rd EBR. The attack put the team of five in a defensive mode and <b>cross</b> <b>firing</b> started. As a result, Mujahid was brutally injured. A shot went clean through his heart resulting in his Shahadat.|$|E
30|$|However, {{one has to}} keep in {{mind that}} in lesions expressing huge uptake heterogeneity, the low pre-therapy {{activity}} could kill cells with high uptakes without killing by <b>cross</b> <b>firing</b> surrounding cells with low uptakes. Afterwards, these cells with high uptake will no longer take 131 I up during the main therapy session (because most are killed), reducing by this way the cross irradiation that the cells with low uptake could have received. This cell type selection occurring during the pre-therapy scan could explain lower rates of ablation success reported in some studies [41, 42].|$|E

40|$|Vascular {{neoplasms}} {{are common}} but are often much debated and discussed out entities. These mesenchymal neoplasms are categorized as benign (haemangiomas) or of intermediate behavior (heamangiopericytoma, Hemangioendotheliomas) and malignant as in Angiosarcoma and Kaposi’s sarcoma. But {{even the most}} benign of entities like haemngiomas can often behave in a nasty way depending on the presentation. Posing great diagnostic dilemma and management delay. We present a rare case {{of a young boy}} presenting with an ever increasing firm nodular growth in the outer left mandible. The gingival and the outer skin was intact. Xray suggested of a cystic multiloculated lesion. Biopsy on histopathology revealed an intraosseous haemngioma. A true rarity in itself with extreme paucity of such reported lesions. Again the origins and the cell of origin of haemngiomas have been at major flashpoints and <b>cross</b> <b>firing</b> especially when taken up as differentials with arteriovenous malformations...|$|E
40|$|The armed {{conflict}} between the Maoists and the government in Nepal started in 1996. After the newly-introduced democratic politics had {{failed to meet the}} hopes of many citizens, the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M) officially launched its ‘people’s war ’ against the constitutional monarchy in February 1996. Since then, the intensity of this violent in-surgency is gaining momentum day by day, and has left more than 13, 000 people dead. Many women, men and innocent children have lost their lives. The impact of the conflict has been felt on various sectors such as agriculture, trade and commerce, education, besides everyday casualties. It has affected socio-economic, cultural, religious and the general life of the people, including the work of NGOs and INGOs tremendously. This Maoist insurgency has had many adverse effects on the overall development of Nepal. Infrastructure—schools (both private and public), health posts, offices of the government and industries—have collapsed. Incidents of violence, such as indiscriminate killings, <b>cross</b> <b>firing</b> and ambushing are growing. There is an increasing trend of migration to dis-trict headquarters and urban centers, particularly Kathmandu (the capital...|$|E
