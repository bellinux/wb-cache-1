40|$|The {{problem of}} heat {{conduction}} in a multi-layer two-dimensional orthotropic cylinder subject to asymmetric and periodic heat flux {{on the outer}} wall was solved analytically. The dimensional analysis of the problem revealed that the heat conduction through the cylinder {{is a function of}} the Biot number (Bi) and four non-dimensional parameters per layer. These layer-dependant parameters include: frequency ratio (a. * m) 'thickness ratio (x* m) ' radial <b>conduction</b> <b>ratio</b> (K* nn) ' and tangential <b>conduction</b> <b>ratio</b> (K*tm) ' The derivation is valid for an arbitrary number of layers. The number of possible combinations increases dramatically with the number of layers. Thus as an example, the results for a cylinder composed from three layers, are presented and discussed. The results showed that the magnitude of heat conduction in a multi-layer orthotropic cylinder can be significantly different from those of an isotropic cylinder subject to the same externally imposed heat flux. The solution could be extended to an arbitrary varying imposed heat flux through the use of Fourier series and the principle of superposition. The solution also includes the analytical periodic temperature distribution across the cylinder. This could be used to study the effect of thermal stress fatigue in each layer and at the interface of adjacent layers...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aims of {{this study}} were to: i) {{investigate}} the role of angiotensin in mediating changes to myocardial electromechanical properties during the development and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) generated by constriction of the thoracic aorta; ii) identify any role of angiotensin- 1 receptor blockade on ameliorating changes to these electromechanical properties. Methods: LVH was induced in guinea-pigs by constricting the ascending aorta (AC groups). After 42 ± 3 days, the constriction was either removed or left in place. Following the second operation animals were fed losartan (10 mg·kg− 1 ·day− 1) or saline for 42 ± 3 days. Sham-operated animals served as controls. In other groups, LVH was generated by subcutaneous angiotensin II (200 ng·kg− 1 ·min− 1) infusion for 42 ± 3 days with or without losartan administration (AT groups), and compared to animals undergoing aortic constriction for a similar period. Electromechanical changes were recorded in isolated left ventricular myocardial preparations. Results: Wet and dry heart-to-body weight ratios (HBR) increased significantly in the AC and AT models compared to control. Losartan prevented the increase of HBR in the AT group. Removal of the constriction allowed LVH to regress to control. The force–frequency relationship was reduced in both models and recovered fully on regression. However, the two models generated different electrophysiological changes: in the AC group, longitudinal conduction velocity was reduced and transverse conduction increased, with a consequent reduction of the anisotropic <b>conduction</b> <b>ratio.</b> On regression recovery was only partial; action potential duration was prolonged and did not recover. In the AT group, electrophysiological changes were limited: only an increase of transverse conduction and a reduction of the anisotropic <b>conduction</b> <b>ratio</b> were observed. Losartan had no effect on HBR or electromechanical variables in the aortic constricted animals, nor did it affect the extent of recovery in animals with regression of LVH. Conclusions: The electromechanical changes to hypertrophied myocardium are different in these two models of LVH. Moreover, losartan was ineffective in modulating the consequences of hypertrophy induced by constriction of the thoracic aorta...|$|E

40|$|A large {{patent ductus arteriosus}} (PDA) is a {{frequently}} encountered clinical {{problem in}} extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. It leads to an increased pulmonary blood flow and in a decreased or reversed diastolic flow in the systemic circulation, resulting in complications. Here we report a possible complication of PDA not previously published. On day 8 of life, a male ELBW infant (birth weight 650 g) born at a gestational age of 23 weeks and 3 days developed an atrioventricular block (AV block). The heart rate dropped from 168 /min to 90 /min, and the ECG showed a Wenckebach second-degree AV block and intraventricular conduction disturbances. Echocardiography demonstrated a PDA with a large left-to-right shunt and large left atrium and left ventricle with high contractility. Within several minutes after surgical closure of the PDA, the heart rate increased, and after 30 min the AV block had improved to a 1 : 1 <b>conduction</b> <b>ratio.</b> Echocardiography after 2 h revealed a significant decrease of the left ventricular and atrial dimensions. Within 12 h, the AV block completely reversed together with the intraventricular conduction disturbances. We suggest that PDA with a large left-to-right shunt and left ventricular volume overload may lead to an AV block in an ELBW infant. Surgical closure of the PDA may be indicated.

40|$|AbstractThe Popeye domain {{containing}} (Popdc) genes encode {{a family}} of transmembrane proteins with an evolutionary conserved Popeye domain. These genes are abundantly expressed in striated muscle tissue, however their function is not well understood. In this study we have investigated {{the role of the}} popdc 2 gene in zebrafish. Popdc 2 transcripts were detected in the embryonic myocardium and transiently in the craniofacial and tail musculature. Morpholino oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of popdc 2 resulted in aberrant development of skeletal muscle and heart. Muscle segments in the trunk were irregularly shaped and craniofacial muscles were severely reduced or even missing. In the heart, pericardial edema was prevalent in the morphants and heart chambers were elongated and looping was abnormal. These pathologies in muscle and heart were alleviated after reducing the morpholino concentration. However the heart still was abnormal displaying cardiac arrhythmia at later stages of development. Optical recordings of cardiac contractility revealed irregular ventricular contractions with a 2 : 1, or 3 : 1 atrial/ventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>ratio,</b> which caused a significant reduction in heart frequency. Recordings of calcium transients with high spatiotemporal resolution using a transgenic calcium indicator line (Tg(cmlc 2 :gCaMP) s 878) and SPIM microscopy confirmed the presence of a severe arrhythmia phenotype.

Two had overt Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome; three Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome; and one a concealed accessory atrioventricular connection. Atrial flutter was initiated, at study, by right atrial pacing and electrograms {{from the right}} atrium and coronary sinus were observed {{for at least five}} minutes to ensure stable flutter in both atria. Atrial flutter was terminated by 2. 5 s or 5 s bursts of atrial pacing at rates 10, 50, or 100 beats/min faster than the intrinsic flutter rate in only two patients. Atrial flutter, which was reinitiated in two patients, was then treated with intravenous disopyramide phosphate, 2 mg/kg body weight, infused over five minutes. In all 10 patients the atrial rate slowed from a mean of 310 +/- 39 beats/min to 217 +/- 27 beats/min and atrial flutter terminated in one case. Though the mean ventricular rate fell from 161 +/- 52 beats/min to 156 +/- 45 beats/min the atrioventricular <b>conduction</b> <b>ratio</b> fell from 2. 17 +/- 0. 86 to 1. 55 +/- 0. 59 and four patients were left with symptomatically significant increases of ventricular rate.

The application of organic molecules and nano-particle/polymer composites for flash memory and switch applications is studied in this dissertation. Facilitating data storage on individual small molecules as the approach the limits in miniaturization for ultra-high density and low power consumption media may enable orders of magnitude increase in data storage capabilities. A floating gate consisting of a thin film of molecules would provide the advantage of a uniform set of identical nano-structured charge storage elements with high molecular area densities which can result in a several-fold higher density of charge-storage sites as compared to quantum dot (QD) memory and even SONOS devices. Additionally, the discrete charge storage in such nano-segmented floating gate designs limits the impact of any tunnel oxide defects to the charge stored in the proximity of the defect site. The charge retention properties of molecular films was investigated in this dissertation by injecting charges via a biased conductive atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip into molecules comprising the thin films. The Kelvin force microscopy (KFM) results revealed minimal changes in the spatial extent of the charge trapping over time after initial injection. Fabricated memory capacitors show a device durability over 105 program/erase cycles and hysteresis window of up to 12. 8 V, corresponding to stored charge densities as high as 5. 4 x 1013 cm- 2, suggesting the potential use of organic molecules in high storage capacity memory cells. Also, these results demonstrate that charge storage properties of the molecular trapping layer can be engineered by rearranging molecules and their a-orbital overlaps via addition of dopant molecules. Finally, the design, fabrication, testing and evaluation of a MEMS switch that employs viscoelastic organic polymers doped with nano-particles as the active material is presented in this dissertation. The conductivity of the nano-composite changes 10, 000 -fold as it is mechanically compressed. In this demonstration the compressive squeeze is applied with electric actuation.

Previous investigators have shown that the frequency compression is related to the decreasing conduction velocity of the muscle fibers. It is proposed that the frequency compression may be tracked by obtaining a continuous estimate of a characteristic frequency of the spectrum, such as the mean and median, or the ratioof low-frequency components to high-frequency components of the speetrum. A theoretical analysis was performed to investigate the restrictions in estimating the three parameters, as well as their sensitivity to the <b>conduction</b> velocity. The <b>ratio</b> parameter was found to be mostsensitive to conduction velocity, but was the least reliable of the three. The median frequency was theleast sensitive to noise. Therefore, from a theoretical point of view, the median frequency is the preferred parameter. A technique is described which determines an unbiased consistent estimate of the median frequency.

BACKGROUND: These patients are often considered high-risk, but their outcome is not well-defined. METHODS: The Hirulog and Early Reperfusion or Occlusion (HERO) - 2 trial compared bivalirudin with heparin in patients receiving streptokinase for ST-segment elevation or presumed-new LBBB. Each patient with LBBB was matched with a control (with normal intraventricular conduction) for age, gender, pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, Killip class, and region. RESULTS: A total of 300 patients had LBBB (92 with and 208 without ST-segment changes) and 15, 340 had normal conduction. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurred in 80. 7 % of LBBB patients and 88. 7 % of controls (p = 0. 006).

40|$|Abstract Background Numerous nerve {{conduction}} {{tests are}} used for the electrodiagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), {{with a wide range}} of sensitivity and specificity reported for each test in clinical studies. The tests have not been assessed in population-based studies. Such information would be important when using electrodiagnosis in epidemiologic research. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of various nerve conduction tests in population-based CTS and determine the properties of the most accurate test. Methods In a population-based study a questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 3, 000 persons. Of 2, 466 responders, 262 symptomatic (numbness/tingling in the radial fingers) and 125 randomly selected asymptomatic responders underwent clinical and electrophysiologic examinations. A standardized hand diagram was administered to the symptomatic persons. At the clinical examination, the examining surgeon identified 94 symptomatic persons as having clinically certain CTS. Nerve conduction tests were then performed on the symptomatic and the asymptomatic persons by blinded examiners. Analysis with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the nerve conduction tests in distinguishing the persons with clinically certain CTS from the asymptomatic persons. Results No difference was shown in the diagnostic accuracy of median nerve distal motor latency, digit-wrist sensory latency, wrist-palm sensory conduction velocity, and wrist-palm/forearm sensory <b>conduction</b> velocity <b>ratio</b> (area under curve, 0. 75 – 0. 76). Median-ulnar digit-wrist sensory latency difference had a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy (area under curve, 0. 80). Using the optimal cutoff value of 0. 8 ms for abnormal sensory latency difference shown on the ROC curve the sensitivity was 70 %, specificity 82 %, positive predictive value 19 % and negative predictive value 98 %. Based on the clinical diagnosis among the symptomatic persons, the hand diagram (classified as classic/probable or possible/unlikely CTS) had high sensitivity but poor specificity. Conclusions Using the clinical diagnosis of CTS as the criterion standard, nerve conduction tests had moderate sensitivity and specificity and a low positive predictive value in population-based CTS. Measurement of median-ulnar sensory latency difference had the highest diagnostic accuracy. The performance of nerve conduction tests in population-based CTS does not necessarily apply to their performance in clinical settings. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two {{aspects of}} an {{intermediate}} heat exchanger (IHX) for GFR service have been investigated: (1) the intrinsic characteristics of the proposed compact printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE); and (2) a specific design optimizing economic and technical efficiency while coupling a supercritical CO 2 Brayton power cycle to a helium cooled fast reactor core. In particular, the wavy channel friction factor and the effective conduction thickness between channels were evaluated by simulations using {{state of the art}} software (FluentTm). To support the competitiveness of the PCHE, it was directly compared to other potential IHX candidates with respect to performance and size for identical operating conditions. All PCHE modeling conservatively assumed straight channels and was carried out using an MIT in-house code. The PCHEs designed specifically for the He/S-CO 2 cycle were designed to be deployed in a prestressed cast iron reactor vessel (PCIV) pod and to permit a net cycle efficiency of at least 40 %. Optimization theory, sensitivity studies, and thermal-hydraulic constraints contributed to shaping the final design. The friction factor analysis showed that the correlations cited in the literature overestimate the value by approximately a factor of two. As regards the effective <b>conduction</b> thickness <b>ratio,</b> it was found to be around 0. 6 for a 2. 0 mm channel diameter. Since the value of the ratio employed in the MIT in-house code is 1. 0, the results generated by the code should be conservative. Comparing the competing IHX types clearly illustrated the advantages of using a compact design, thus favoring PCHEs and plate-fin designs. A maximum net cycle efficiency of 40. 9 % was achieved for the proposed cycle utilizing a low-pressure-drop reference core. The cost and core volume of this 600 MWt PCHE design were estimated to be $ 2. 4 M and 16. 4 inm 3, respectively. The largest uncertainty associated with the computations is whether the PCIV pod provides sufficient space for deployment of the PCHE, a blower, and other ancillary equipment. However, studies of PCHEs based on zig-zag channels indicate that the compactness can be further enhanced by a factor of 2 to 3 thanks to the increased heat transfer capability of the saw-tooth channel geometry. More research is needed to verify this projection. by Knut Gezelius. Thesis (S. M. and S. B.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Nuclear Engineering, 2004.

40|$|OBJECTIVE - To {{evaluate}} the discriminative {{power of the}} Diabetic Neuropathy Symptom (DNS) and Diabetic Neuropathy Examination (DNE) scores for diagnosing diabetic polyneuropathy (PNP), {{as well as their}} relation with cardiovascular autonomic function testing (cAFT) and electro-diagnostic studies (EDS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Three groups (matched for age and sex) were selected: 24 diabetic patients with neuropathic foot ulcers (DU), 24 diabetic patients without clinical neuropathy or ulcers (DC), and 21 control subjects without diabetes (C). In all participants, the DNS and DNE scores were assessed and cAFT (heart rate variability [HRV], baroreflex sensitivity [BRS]), and EDS were performed (Nerve Conduction Sum [NCS] score; muscle fiber <b>conduction</b> velocity fastest/slowest <b>ratio</b> [F/S ratio]). RESULTS - Both the DNS and the DNE scores discriminated between the DU and DC groups significantly (P < 0. 001). The DNE score even discriminated between DC and C (P < 0. 05). Spearman's correlation coefficients between both DNS and DNE scores and cAFT (HRV - 0. 42 and - 0. 44; BRS - 0. 30 and - 0. 29, respectively) and EDS (NCS 0. 51 and 0. 62; F/S ratio 0. 44 and 0. 62, respectively) were high. Odds ratios were calculated for both DNS and DNE score, with cAFT (HRV 4. 4 and 5. 7; BRS 20. 7 and 14. 2, respectively) and EDS (NCS 5. 6 and 16. 8; F/S ratio 7. 2 and 18. 8, respectively). CONCLUSIONS - The DNS and DNE scores are able to discriminate between patients with and without PNP and are strongly related to cAFT and EDS. This further confirms the strength of the DNS and DNE scores in diagnosing diabetic PNP in daily clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} strain-balanced lnGaAs/ln(Ga,Al) As {{multiple}} quantum well samples were investigated using optical spectroscopy. An analysis of magneto-absorption spectra provided {{information on the}} effects of inbuilt strain on the relative positions of heavy and light hole valence subbands, and on the in-plane effective masses of the holes. Both tension and compression have been shown to reduce the value of the heavy hole in-plane effective mass from its value in the lattice matched system. For one material three sets of excitonic Landau levels could be resolved in the spectra, allowing estimates of the reduced excitonic effective mass of the first and second electron to heavy hole (0. 040 +- 0. 001 m sub e and 0. 034 +- 0. 02 m sub e) and the first electron to light hole (0. 053 +- 0. 002 m sub e) excitons. Enhancement in the light hole in-plane effective mass, relative to the heavy hole, is shown to result from the tensile strain in the quantum wells. The theoretical fitting of transition energies observed in the OT absorption spectra of samples with different degrees of strain in the wells is described. This allowed estimates of the <b>conduction</b> band offset <b>ratio</b> (Q sub c) to be made for strain balanced systems. The value of Q sub c was found to be Q sub c = 0. 74 +- 0. 10, 0. 55 +- 0. 08 and 0. 52 +- 0. 08 for samples with well strain of - 0. 10 %, 0. 14 % and 0. 40 % respectively. This decrease in Q sub c as the degree of tension in the wells was increased was more greatly pronounced than in single strain systems. Photoluminescence measurements made {{across the surface of the}} materials show little shift, indicating homogenous sample compositions. Temperature dependant photoluminescence measurements of these samples show evidence of thermal excitation of carriers between the first light and heavy hole states.

40|$|Object. Human {{amniotic fluid}} derived mesenchymal stem cells (AFMSCs) {{have been shown}} to promote {{peripheral}} nerve regeneration, and the local delivery of neurotrophic factors may additionally enhance nerve regeneration capacity. The present study evaluates whether the transplantation of glia cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) modified human AFMSCs may enhance regeneration of sciatic nerve after a crush injury. Methods. Peripheral nerve injury was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats by crushing the left sciatic nerve using a vessel clamp. Either GDNF-modified human AFMSCs or human AFMSCs were embedded in Matrigel and delivered to the injured nerve. Motor function and electrophysiological studies were conducted after I and 4 weeks. Early or later nerve regeneration markers were used to evaluate nerve regeneration. The expression of GDNF in the transplanted human AFMSCs and GDNF-modified human AFMSCs was monitored at 7 -day intervals. Results. Human AFMSCs were successfully transfected with adenovirus, and a significant amount of GDNF was detected in human AFMSCs or the culture medium supernatant. Increases in the sciatic nerve function index, the compound muscle action potential <b>ratio,</b> <b>conduction</b> latency, and muscle weight were found in the groups treated with human AFMSCs or GDNF-modified human AFMSCs. Importantly, the GDNF-modified human AFMSCs induced the greatest improvement. Expression of markers of early nerve regeneration, such as increased expression of neurofilament and BrdU and reduced Schwann cell apoptosis, as well as late regeneration markers, consisting of reduced vacuole counts, increased expression of Luxol fast blue and S 100 protein, paralleled the results of motor function. The expression of GDNF in GDNF-modified human AFMSCs was demonstrated up to 4 weeks; however, the expression decreased over time. Conclusions. The GDNF-modified human AFMSCs appeared to promote nerve regeneration. The consecutive expression of GDNF was demonstrated in GDNF-modified human AFMSCs up to 4 weeks. These findings support a nerve regeneration scenario involving cell transplantation with additional neurotrophic factor secretion. (DOI: 10. 3171 / 2009. 8. JNS 09850...|$|R
40|$|Excess cardiac myofibroblasts in fibrotic heart {{diseases}} {{as well as}} cell-based therapies involving implantation of {{stem cells}} or genetically engineered somatic cells in the heart may all lead to a situation where a cardiomyocyte becomes electrically coupled to an unexcitable cell. In these settings, electrotonic loading of cardiomyocytes by unexcitable cells can affect cardiac action potential generation, propagation, and repolarization depending on the properties of both cardiomyocytes and unexcitable cells. The objective of this dissertation was to advance {{our understanding of the}} electrical interactions between cardiomyocytes and unexcitable cells using a variety of electrophysiological, molecular, and cell culture techniques. First, we utilized aligned cardiomyocyte monolayers covered with unexcitable cardiac fibroblasts or human embryonic kidney- 293 (HEK) cells that expressed similar levels of the gap junction protein connexin- 45. These cells weakly coupled to cardiomyocytes and marginally slowed cardiac conduction only at high coverage density, while producing no other measurable electrophysiological changes in cardiomyocytes. In contrast, unexcitable HEK cells genetically engineered to stably express the more conductive connexin- 43 channels (Cx 43 HEK) strongly coupled to cardiomyocytes, depolarized cardiac resting membrane potential, significantly slowed impulse propagation, decreased maximum capture rate, and increased action potential duration (APD) at high coverage density. None of the studied unexcitable cells significantly altered <b>conduction</b> velocity anisotropy <b>ratio</b> or the relatively low incidence of pacemaking activity of cardiac monolayers at any coverage density. Next, we utilized individual micropatterned cell pairs consisting of a cardiomyocyte and an unexcitable Cx 43 HEK cell with or without stably overexpressed inward rectifier potassium channels (Kir 2. 1 +Cx 43 HEK). By systematically varying the relative sizes of micropatterned cells, we showed that Cx 43 HEK cells significantly depolarized cardiomyocytes, reduced maximum upstroke velocity and action potential amplitude, prolonged APD, and modulated beating rate as a function of HEK:CM area ratio. In contrast, in cell pairs formed between cardiomyocytes and Kir 2. 1 +Cx 43 HEK cells we observed significant reduction in cardiomyocyte action potential amplitude, duration, and maximum upstroke velocity, but no change in other measured parameters. Finally, we utilized a hybrid dynamic clamp setting consisting of a live micropatterned cardiomyocyte coupled in real time to a virtual model of capacitive and/or ionic current components of Cx 43 HEK or Kir 2. 1 +Cx 43 HEK cells. We found that coupling of cardiomyocytes to the ionic current components of Cx 43 HEK or Kir 2. 1 +Cx 43 HEK cells was sufficient to reproduce the dependence of cardiomyocyte maximal diastolic potential and pacemaking behavior on HEK:CM area ratio observed in micropatterned cell pairs, but did not replicate the observed changes in action potential upstroke or duration. The pure capacitance model with no ionic current, on the other hand, significantly decreased cardiomyocyte maximum upstroke velocity and prolonged cardiomyocyte APD as function of HEK:CM area ratio without affecting maximal diastolic potential or pacemaking behavior. When the unexcitable cell model containing both capacitive and ionic currents was connected to cardiomyocytes, all changes in action potential shape observed in micropatterned cell pairs were accurately reproduced. These studies describe how coupling of unexcitable cells to cardiomyocytes can alter cardiomyocyte electrophysiological properties dependent on the unexcitable cell connexin isoform expression, ion channel expression, and cell size. This knowledge is expected to aid in the design of safe and efficient cell and gene therapies for myocardial infarction, fibrotic heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. Dissertatio...|$|R
