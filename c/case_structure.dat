5|$|Early Old Swedish was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} modern language in {{that it had a}} more complex <b>case</b> <b>structure</b> and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant nominative, there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. The masculine and feminine genders were later merged into a common gender with the definite suffix -en and the definite article den, in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents -et and det. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.|$|E

5000|$|Serbo-Croatian has a rich <b>case</b> <b>structure</b> that is {{reflected}} in the declension of nouns and adjectives. That allows for a great deal of freedom in word order. In English, for example, the word order shows a difference in meaning between [...] "Man bites dog" [...] and [...] "Dog bites man". In Serbo-Croatian, Čovjek grize psa and Čovjeka grize pas have the same word order, but the meanings are shown by the noun endings. Any order of the three constituents is grammatically correct, and the meaning is clear because of the declensions. However, the usual order is subject-verb-object, as in English.|$|E
30|$|Structures such as faults, {{joints and}} {{fractures}} of diverse patterns have acted as precursors of several slope instability cases within the Benue Trough Nigeria.

In other <b>cases,</b> <b>structure</b> orientation played significant {{roles in the}} mobility and eventual runout distance of debris flow and avalanches in the region. Detailed field-based structural, fracture and paleostress analyses were therefore carried out to determine the fractural patterns that correlate to reported instability and landslide cases in the region; and to produce models that reveal areas with heightened risk.|$|R

Similarly, the inscription text does not use the plural verb forms that were common in the 14th century and have only recently disappeared: for example, (plural forms in parenthesis) [...] "wi war" [...] (wörum), [...] "hathe" [...] (höfuðum), [...] "wi fiske" [...] (fiskaðum), [...] "kom" [...] (komum), [...] "fann" [...] (funnum) and [...] "wi hathe" [...] (hafdum).|$|E

50|$|DCI {{recognizes the}} Waiter {{as an object}} rather than, say, a {{composition}} of an Employee part, a Waiter part and a Person part. The object has its own identity independent of the use case; this is the Data facet of DCI. Roles are aliased names for their objects but are never separate objects themselves; that would cause self schizophrenia. In this sense, every Waiter is a homo sapiens. This is the Waiter's rudimentary what-the-system-is part. The object has many possible identities depending on the use case it is involved in; this surfaces in the Role identities that form part of the Interaction facet of DCI. These are the (usually more interesting) what-the-system-does part. However, in DCI, {{there is only a}} single object that carries both these perspectives at run time. These perspectives may be grouped differently at coding time. The code is dominated by the use <b>case</b> <b>structure,</b> which cuts across the objects, and which also is part of the Interaction facet of DCI.|$|E

The {{principal}} ones can be classified as live loads (loads which are not always present in the structure), dead loads (loads which are permanent and immovable excepting redesign or renovation) and wind load, as described below.

The expected maximum magnitude of each {{is referred to as the}} characteristic load.|$|R
50|$|In LabVIEW state {{machines}} can be started by simply creating a while loop with a <b>case</b> <b>structure</b> {{located within the}} loop. The while loop can have a special constant wired to it called an enumerated constant. An enumerated constant is a constant word or phrase is changed to a simple integer from 0 to n - 1, where n {{is the number of}} cases the user would like to have. Doing this makes programming a lot easier for the user to understand because instead of looking at number codes they are looking at a few words describing what is going on. A state machine also relies heavily on shift registers. A shift register is used to pass information around in a while loop, for example a shift register will start with information that will be worked on in the loop, after the work is finished then new value can be saved on the shift register to be used {{at the start of the}} loop next time. Next all the programmer has to do is add tasks to each case individually. After the initial enumerated constant is created it is often worth while to make it into a type definition (commonly referred to as type def.). Making the enumerated constant into a type def. allows the user to continue to copy the original and re-use it in the program, like a normal control except with a type def. if you change one of them you end up changing all of them. Type def. allows the program to be much more robust and making it much simpler to change if something new needs to be added.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{part of the}} huts {{is given}} an ancient appearance whereas the interior of each hut has rectangular space (for housing permanent and temporary exhibitions, administration offices and studio spaces), where all amenities feature modern technology. The space within each hut was achieved by discarding the central pillar, a deviation from the traditional Kanak hut design. In the circular design of the hut’s shells, the height to diameter ratio was reduced giving more space, which also resulted in greater dynamic ventilation, as was corroborated by wind tunnel tests. The cases have giant curved ribs or staves, which are made of iroko slats and steel connections and which also act as climate control devices. The outer ribs are a curved assembly of slats, which are joined to a straight vertical rib that together form part of the <b>case</b> <b>structure.</b> The staves are designed {{in such a way}} that the individual pieces appear as if they are woven together. The roof is made of corrugated aluminium sheets. It has a double roof system, which contributes to the play of shadows. The bottom of the wall, formed by the arc of the staves, has special louvers, called nacos. The nacos open and close in tandem automatically by computer control calibrated to the speed of the wind. The double roof system also allows air to pass through the roof unchecked. During the monsoon season, the winds that blow over the cases are very strong, the compound curve of the cases resists the wind, with the nacos facilitating this action further by allowing air to pass directly through the cases.|$|E
50|$|Grain {{boundaries}} are the preferential site for segregation of impurities, which may form {{a thin layer}} with a different composition from the bulk. For example, {{a thin layer of}} silica, which also contains impurity cations, is often present in silicon nitride. These grain boundary phases are thermodynamically stable and can be considered as quasi-two-dimensional phase, which may undergo to transition, similar to those of bulk phases. In this <b>case</b> <b>structure</b> and chemistry abrupt changes are possible at a critical value of a thermodynamic parameter like temperature or pressure. This may strongly affect the macroscopic properties of the material, for example the electrical resistance or creep rates. Grain boundaries can be analyzed using equilibrium thermodynamics but cannot be considered as phases, because they do not satisfy Gibbs'definition: they are inhomogeneous, may have a gradient of structure, composition or properties. For this reasons they are defined as complexion: an interfacial material or stata that is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its abutting phases, with a finite and stable thickness (that is typically 2-20 Å). A complexion need the abutting phase to exist and its composition and structure need to be different from the abutting phase. Contrary to bulk phases, complexions also depend on the abutting phase. For example, silica rich amorphous layer present in Si3N3, is about 10 Å thick, but for special boundaries this equilibrium thickness is zero. Complexion can be grouped in 6 categories, according to their thickness: monolayer, bilayer, trilayer, nanolayer (with equilibrium thickness between 1 and 2 nm) and wetting. In the first cases the thickness of the layer will be constant; if extra material is present it will segregate at multiple grain junction, while in the last case there is no equilibrium thickness and this is determined by the amount of secondary phase present in the material. One example of grain boundary complexion transition is the passage from dry boundary to biltilayer in Au-doped Si, which is produced by the increase of Au.|$|E
