50|$|The <b>cesser</b> <b>clause</b> {{has come}} into common use because, frequently, the charterers are not {{personally}} interested in the cargo. They may be merely agents, or may have chartered the vessel as a speculation {{to make a profit}} upon the bill of lading freight. The effect of the clause is that by the charterers shipping a full cargo, they fulfill all their obligations. The shipowner discharges them from further liability and takes instead a lien on the cargo for payment of all freight, demurrage, or dead freight that is payable. It has become established {{in the construction of the}} <b>cesser</b> <b>clause</b> that, if the language permits it, the cesser of liability is assumed co-extensive only with the lien given to the shipowner. In other words, the charterers are only released from liabilities that have been replaced by a lien given to the shipowner.|$|E
50|$|Some clauses {{specify the}} amount of freight to pay and the manner and time of payment. A clause may specify the length of time, usually {{described}} as lay days, for loading and discharging, and for the demurrage to pay if the vessel is detained beyond the lay days. There is usually also a clause that requires that the merchant bear the risk and expense to bring the cargo to the ship and collect it on delivery. Another clause specifies that the master must sign bills of lading for the cargo, either {{at the same rate}} payable under the charter-party, or commonly at any rate of freight (with a stipulation that, if the total bill of lading freight is less than the total freight payable under the charter-party, the charterers pay the difference to the master before the vessel sails). There is usually what is called the <b>cesser</b> <b>clause,</b> by which the charterer's liability under the charter-party ceases on shipment of the cargo, the shipowner taking a lien on the cargo for freight, dead freight, and demurrage. The charter-party is subject to exceptions similar to those in bills of lading. Typically, other clauses provide for commissions paid to the brokers on signing the charter-party, the address commission paid to the agents for the Vessel at the port of discharge, and other details. Clauses in charter-parties vary, but the above outlines what is typical.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBoth by {{the common}} law or express {{contractual}} provision, the ship owner enjoys the right to retain the goods in the port of discharge as a security for the payment of freight or other charges. The article aims at analyzing the characteristics of common law and contractual liens: their legal nature, enforceability, effectiveness and conditions for the exercise of a contractual lien when cargo is owned by a third party. Closely related {{to the existence of}} lien is the <b>cesser</b> <b>clause.</b> Its purpose is to terminate the charterer's personal liability for specified payments on shipment of the cargo {{and at the same time}} to allow the ship owner to exercise a privilege as he might have at common law plus additional liens (typically for dead freight, demurrage and damages for detention). The conditions that enable the existence of a <b>cesser</b> <b>clause</b> are also analyzed thereby...|$|E
