Also that year, Aderca compiled interviews with literary figures, intellectuals and artists, {{under the title}} Mărturia unei generații ("A Generation's Testimony"). The book, illustrated with ink portraits drawn by the Constructivist artist Marcel Janco, was, its title notwithstanding, a homage to writers of several generations. It notably included an extended discussion between Aderca and Lovinescu, summarizing the compatibilities, and disagreements, between the two Sburătorists. Elsewhere, Aderca approaches Ion Barbu to discuss the principal stages in Barbu's poetry: Barbu rejects Aderca's calling his 1920s hermetics phase șaradistă ("charades-ist"), opening up a field of debates between later exegetes of his work.|$|E

Although externally it has a feeling of unity and correspondence between the arches of the porch and the inner aisles of the church (as did the ancient basilicas), internally there is no correspondence to the porch. Although there is no correspondence between the church porch and created a visual filter that fitting the porch with the five-aisled nave of the church is the central sector deliberately emphasized with the sharp two-tone white and green. This <b>connecting</b> <b>element</b> is compatible with the outer porch and with the internal space of the church, since it repeats the structure; it creates a continuity illusory between interior and exterior, and thus to avoid the feeling of narrowness that would feel great going into a space less than what was expected: the outside perceive a very large, we see entering the church does not have the breadth that we had perceived from the outside without that element of connection, once inside the church we perceived a narrow volume. In architecture, many elements are based on emotional perceptions of those who live the architectural volumes, and sometimes just a different color may be enough to make a space seem bigger.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytic}} {{development of}} the information array obtained with a single tracking pass of phase-delay measurements made from a short baseline interferometer is presented. Phase-delay observations {{can be made with}} great precision from two antennas using a single, common distributed frequency standard, hence the name <b>connected</b> <b>element.</b> With the information array, closed-form expressions are developed for the error covariance in declination and right ascension. These equations serve as useful tools for analyzing the relative merits of candidate station locations for <b>connected</b> <b>element</b> interferometry (CEI). The navigation performance of a short baseline interferometer located at the Deep Space Network's (DSN's) Goldstone intracomplex is compared with that which is presently achievable using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) over intercontinental baselines. The performance of an intracomplex pair of short baselines formed by three stations is also investigated, along {{with the use of a}} single baseline in conjunction with conventional two-way Doppler data. The phase-delay measurement accuracy and data rate used in the analysis are based on the expected performance of an experimental <b>connected</b> <b>element</b> system presently under construction at Goldstone. The results indicate that the VLBI system that will be used during the Galileo mission can determine the declination and right ascension of a distant spacecraft to an accuracy of 20 to 25 nrad, while the CEI triad system and the combination of CEI-Doppler system are both capable of 30 to 70 nrad performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{describes a}} process for the shaping of electrically conducting terminal bumps on electrically conducting microelectronic connecting elements. In conventional processes, a terminal bump is produced in a deep-draw process, whereby the <b>connecting</b> <b>element</b> is pressed by a die into a recess of a substrate on which the <b>connecting</b> <b>element</b> is fixed. The disadvantage is that a recess occurs next to the terminal bump on the side facing the die, said recess being deleterious for the mechanical loading capability and also for subsequent tab bonding. In the process according to the invention, however, a shaping tool is pressed onto part of {{the surface of a}} <b>connecting</b> <b>element,</b> whereby one or more terminal bumps are formed by the plastic deformation of the <b>connecting</b> <b>element</b> material {{in this part of the}} surface due to the geometry of the shaping tool, however, the <b>connecting</b> <b>element</b> suffers no further deformation outside said part of the surface. The advantages of the process according t o the invention are that no shaping substrate matched to the desired terminal bumps is required, that conventional wire bonding units can be used, that the process is fast, low-priced and precise and that the mechanical loading capability of a <b>connecting</b> <b>element,</b> in particular a metal lead, is [...] due to the formation. ...|$|E
