5|$|The first curium {{samples were}} barely visible, and were {{identified}} by their radioactivity. Louis Werner and Isadore Perlman <b>created</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> substantial sample of 30µg curium-242 hydroxide at the University of California in 1947 by bombarding americium-241 with neutrons. Macroscopic amounts of curium(III) fluoride were obtained in 1950 by W. W. T. Crane, J. C. Wallmann and B. B. Cunningham. Its magnetic susceptibility {{was very close to}} that of GdF3 providing the first experimental evidence for the +3 valence of curium in its compounds. Curium metal was produced only in 1951 by reduction of CmF3 with barium.|$|E
