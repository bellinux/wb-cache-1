5000|$|According to legend, Bhrigu Muni was {{the first}} to have {{discovered}} Amarnath. Long time ago it is believed that The Vale of Kashmir was submerged under water and Kashyapa Muni drained it through a series of rivers and rivulets. Therefore, when the waters drained, Bhrigu Muni {{was the first}} to have Darshan of Lord Amarnath. Thereafter, when people heard of the Lingam, it became an abode of Lord Bholenath for all believers and a pilgrimage which is done by lakhs of people each year.As we well know François Bernier, a French physician accompanied Emperor Aurangzeb during his visit to Kashmir in 1663. In his book “Travels in Mughal Empire” he writes while giving an account the places he visited in Kashmir that he was “pursuing journey to a grotto full of wonderful <b>congelations,</b> two days journey from Sangsafed” when he “received intelligence that my Nawab felt very impatient and uneasy on account of my long absence”. The “grotto” he refers to is obviously the Amarnath cave as the editor of the second edition of the English translation of the book, Vincient A. Smith makes clear in his introduction. He writes: “The grotto full of wonderful <b>congelations</b> is the Amarnath cave, where blocks of ice, stalagmites formed by dripping water from the roof are worshipped by many Hindus who resort here as images of Shiva…..” ...|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} {{discussion on the}} climate of the southern parts of the continent with relation to its productions, on the snow-line, on the extraordinarily low descent of the glaciers, and on the zone of perpetual <b>congelation</b> in the antarctic islands, may be passed over by any one not interested in these curious subjects, or the final recapitulation alone may be read. I shall, however, here give only an abstract, and must refer for details to the Thirteenth Chapter and the Appendix of the former edition of this work.|$|E

As it did {{not seem}} likely that this law of the {{assumption}} of conducting power during liquefaction, and loss of it during <b>congelation,</b> would be peculiar to water, I immediately proceeded to ascertain its influence in other cases, and found it to be very general. For this purpose bodies were chosen which were solid at common temperatures, but readily fusible; and of such composition as, for other reasons connected with electrochemical action, led to the conclusion that they would be able when fused to replace water as conductors. A voltaic battery of two troughs, or twenty pairs of four-inch plates (384.), was used as the source of electricity, and a galvanometer introduced into the circuit to indicate {{the presence or absence of}} a current.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have before}} me a pathetic witness of this fact. It is the note-book once {{used for the}} random jottings of a gentleman of the period. In it I read: [...] "Fair Lydia, if my earthly harp." [...] This is crossed out, and below it appears, [...] "Fair Lydia, COULD my earthly harp." [...] This again is erased, and under it appears, [...] "Fair Lydia, SHOULD my earthly harp." [...] This again is struck out with a despairing stroke, and amended to read: [...] "Fair Lydia, DID my earthly harp." [...] So that finally, when the lines {{appeared}} in the Gentleman's Magazine (1845) in their ultimate shape--"Fair Edith, when with fluent pen," [...] etc., etc.--one can realize from what a desperate <b>congelation</b> the fluent pen had been so perseveringly rescued.|$|E
60|$|These remarks, I may be {{permitted}} to add, directly bear {{on the case of}} the Siberian animals preserved in ice. The firm conviction of the necessity of a vegetation possessing a character of tropical luxuriance, to support such large animals, and the impossibility of reconciling this with the proximity of perpetual <b>congelation,</b> was one chief cause of the several theories of sudden revolutions of climate, and of overwhelming catastrophes, which were invented to account for their entombment. I am far from supposing that the climate has not changed since the period when those animals lived, which now lie buried in the ice. At present I only wish to show, that as far as QUANTITY of food ALONE is concerned, the ancient rhinoceroses might have roamed over the STEPPES of central Siberia (the northern parts probably being under water) even in their present condition, as well as the living rhinoceroses and elephants over the KARROS of Southern Africa.|$|E
60|$|Our first day's {{journey was}} wholly without interest, through a country entirely flat, and looking wretchedly brown and barren. There were rows of trees, very slender, very prim and formal; there was ice {{wherever}} there {{happened to be}} any water to form it; there were occasional villages, compact little streets, or masses of stone or plastered cottages, very dirty and with gable ends and earthen roofs; and a succession of this same landscape was all that we saw, whenever we rubbed away the <b>congelation</b> of our breath from the carriage windows. Thus we rode on, all day long, from eleven o'clock, with hardly a five minutes' stop, till long after dark, {{when we came to}} Dijon, where there was a halt of twenty-five minutes for dinner. Then we set forth again, and rumbled forward, through cold and darkness without, until we reached Lyons at about ten o'clock. We left our luggage at the railway station, and took an omnibus for the Hotel de Provence, which we chose at a venture, among a score of other hotels.|$|E
60|$|This I {{would not}} hear of, {{so he took}} the top, and I faced him. It was a nice little dinner,--seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,--and it {{acquired}} additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us. This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have said, the lap of luxury,--being entirely furnished forth from the coffee-house,--the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell over them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room,--where I found much of its parsley and butter {{in a state of}} <b>congelation</b> when I retired for the night. All this made the feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy.|$|E

There is no law, but only gravitation and <b>congelation,</b> and we are stuck together in an everlasting hail, and melted together in everlasting mud, and great was the day in which our worships were born. And there is no Gospel, but only, whatever we've got, to get more, and, wherever we are, to go somewhere else.

50|$|Sea ice freezes and melts {{due to a}} {{combination}} of factors, including the age of the ice, air temperatures, and solar insolation. During the winter the area of the Arctic Ocean covered by sea ice increases, usually reaching a maximum extent during the month of March. The area covered in sea ice then decreases, reaching its minimum extent in September most years. First-year ice melts more easily than older ice for two reasons: 1) First-year ice is thinner than older ice, since the process of <b>congelation</b> growth has had less time to operate; and 2) first-year ice is less permeable than older ice, so summer meltwater tends to form deeper ponds on the first-year ice surface than on older ice, and deeper ponds mean lower albedo and thus greater solar energy capture.|$|E

5000|$|Once a crack occurs {{within the}} ice cover {{and begins to}} expand {{to make up a}} lead, the open water inside the lead is exposed to the cold air {{temperatures}} and will freeze. Because wind fetch inside a lead is typically very short, wave action is considerably reduced. Ice growth therefore takes place in a low energy regime environment. Following a stage of frazil ice formation, which sometimes results from seeding by snow crystals, the resulting thin ice skim is followed by the growth of <b>congelation</b> ice. In windier regions, as in the Southern Ocean, frazil ice accumulation may occur along the downwind side of leads. If the ice on that side is thin, the frazil may be driven below that ice (resulting in a complex interlayering pattern). Leads affect global water circulation. As ice begins to form inside a lead, it incorporates some of the salt in the seawater [...] but rejects most of it. This brine then sinks, inducing convective processes in the water column below.|$|E
50|$|Such is {{the nature}} of the {{vegetable}} system, that the temperature of its parts seems in a considerable degree to depend on that of the surrounding medium. Mr. Hunter, in a number of experiments which he made upon the sap of different trees, found it frequently to be as low as 15 degrees of Fahrenheit, and that then it preserved its natural and unfrozen state; but, on the contrary, when it was taken out of the vessels of the tree, it would freeze at the elevated temperature of 32°. The cause of this diversity evidently arose from the different circumstances under which it was situated: in the one it was in union with the whole of the living system, resisting, by virtue of its living power, the external operation of cold; its vitality therefore preserved its fluidity: in the other, the loss of vitality which the sap had sustained by separation from the system to which it belonged, weakened its powers of preservation and of resistance; it therefore underwent the same changes of <b>congelation</b> that matter of an inanimate kind is found to sustain.|$|E
50|$|The book De Mundo chapter 4, is {{dedicated}} to the study of meteorology, i.e. on cloudsCloud is a vaporous mass, concentrated and producing water. Rain is produced from the compression of a closely condensed cloud, varying according to the pressure exerted on the cloud; when the pressure is slight it scatters gentle drops; when it is great it produces a more violent fall, and we call this a shower, being heavier than ordinary rain, and forming continuous masses of water falling over earth. Snow is produced by the breaking up of condensed clouds, the cleavage taking place before the change into water; it is the process of cleavage which causes its resemblance to foam and its intense whiteness, while the cause of its coldness is the <b>congelation</b> of the moisture in it before it is dispersed or rarefied. When snow is violent and falls heavily we call it a blizzard. Hail is produced when snow becomes densified and acquires impetus for a swifter fall from its close mass; the weight becomes greater and the fall more violent in proportion {{to the size of the}} broken fragments of cloud. Such then are the phenomena which occur as the result of moist exhalation.|$|E
50|$|In calm water, {{the first}} sea ice to {{form on the}} surface is a skim of {{separate}} crystals which initially are {{in the form of}} tiny discs, floating flat on the surface and of diameter less than 0.3 cm. Each disc has its c-axis vertical and grows outwards laterally. At a certain point such a disc shape becomes unstable, and the growing isolated crystals take on a hexagonal, stellar form, with long fragile arms stretching out over the surface. These crystals also have their c-axis vertical. The dendritic arms are very fragile, and soon break off, leaving a mixture of discs and arm fragments. With any kind of turbulence in the water, these fragments break up further into random-shaped small crystals which form a suspension of increasing density in the surface water, an ice type called frazil or grease ice. In quiet conditions the frazil crystals soon freeze together to form a continuous thin sheet of young ice; in its early stages, when it is still transparent — that is the ice called nilas. Once nilas has formed, a quite different growth process occurs, in which water freezes on {{to the bottom of the}} existing ice sheet, a process called <b>congelation</b> growth. This growth process yields first-year ice.|$|E

5000|$|Raoult's name is {{best known}} in {{connection}} with work on solutions, to which he devoted {{the last two decades}} of his life. His first paper describing how solutes depressed the freezing points of solutions was published in 1878. [...] Further experiments with various solvents, such as benzene and acetic acid, in addition to water, led him to believe in a simple relation between the molecular weights of a solute and the freezing-point of a solution. He expressed the relationship as the loi générale de la <b>congélation</b> (general law of freezing), that if one molecule of a substance be dissolved in 100 molecules of any given solvent, the temperature of solidification of the latter will be lowered by 0.63 °C. Another relation on which Raoult worked was that concerning the depression of a solvent's vapor pressure, due to a solute, showing that the decrease is proportional to the solute's molecular weight. This relationships holds best in the limiting case of a dilute solution. [...] These two generalizations afforded a new method of determining the molecular weights of dissolved substances, and were utilized by Jacobus van 't Hoff and Wilhelm Ostwald, among other chemists, in support of the hypothesis of electrolytic dissociation in solutions. Raoult's freezing-point depression method became even more useful after it was improved by Ernst Otto Beckmann and became a standard technique for determining molecular weights of organic substances.|$|E
