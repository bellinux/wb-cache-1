5|$|After an {{economic}} crisis in 1931, the King dissolved parliament and Birkett returned to Nottingham East to defend his seat; his main opponent was the Conservative, Louis Gluckstein, who had <b>challenged</b> <b>him</b> in the 1929 election. The Conservative Party's support of protectionism met with approval from the electorate, as most were employed in industries which had suffered after the institution of free trade. Gluckstein won the general election on 27 October 1931 with a majority of 5,583 votes.|$|E
5|$|Among {{those who}} {{defected}} to El Buen Pastor Church was Lino Figueroa, the pastor who had re-baptized González in 1938.

The whole congregation was re-baptized as well, as now Joaquín was the source of baptismal legitimacy and authenticity.

Novotný then invited Soviet premier Leonid Brezhnev to Prague that December, seeking support; but Brezhnev was surprised at the extent of the opposition to Novotný and thus supported his removal as Czechoslovakia's leader. Dubček replaced Novotný as First Secretary on 5 January 1968. On 22 March 1968, Novotný resigned his presidency and was replaced by Ludvík Svoboda, who later gave consent to the reforms.|$|E

5|$|In 1884, McCreary {{was elected}} to the first of six {{consecutive}} terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. As a legislator, he was an advocate of free silver and a champion of the state's agricultural interests. After two failed bids for election to the Senate, McCreary secured the support of Governor J. C. W. Beckham, and in 1902, the General Assembly elected him to the Senate. He served one largely undistinguished term, and Beckham successfully <b>challenged</b> <b>him</b> for his Senate seat in 1908. The divide between McCreary and Beckham was short-lived, however, and Beckham supported McCreary's election to a second term as governor in 1911.|$|E

5|$|After WrestleMania 32, on the April 4, 2016 {{episode of}} Raw, Ziggler {{went to a}} double countout with Baron Corbin, leading to Corbin hitting an End of Days outside of the ring to Ziggler, igniting a feud in the process. At the Payback pre-show, Ziggler faced Baron Corbin in a winning effort. The two then had a no {{disqualification}} match at Extreme Rules where Corbin won after hitting a low blow on Ziggler. Following Extreme Rules, on the May 23 episode of Raw, Ziggler had a confrontation backstage with Corbin and <b>challenged</b> <b>him</b> to a technical wrestling match the next week. In that match, Ziggler intentionally got himself disqualified when he kicked Corbin in the groin immediately after the match began. This led to a rubber match at Money in the Bank, which Corbin won to end their feud.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge began reforms {{immediately}} and zealously. He secured the General Assembly's {{passage of a}} two-cent property tax for education. The tax was subject to voter approval, and Breckinridge worked hard to publicize the issue. His efforts paid off, as the tax passed by almost a two-to-one margin. Continuing to publicize needs and push legislators to action, Breckinridge enjoyed the support of {{five of the six}} governors under whom he served. Only John L. Helm, who opposed a state-funded school system, <b>challenged</b> <b>him,</b> but Helm's veto of a Breckinridge educational bill was overridden in the General Assembly. Breckinridge's reforms manifested tangible results. From 1847 to 1850, educational spending increased from $6,000 to $144,000. By 1850, only one out of every ten school age children did not attend school.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1974, Australia {{was in an}} {{economic}} slump, suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and 1973–75 recession. The 1973 oil crisis had caused prices to spike and, according to government figures, inflation topped 13percent {{for over a year}} between 1973 and 1974. Part of the inflation was due to Whitlam's desire to increase wages and conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter for the private sector. The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25percent in 1973; 1974 saw an increase in imports of 30percent and a $1.5billion increase in the trade deficit. Primary producers of commodities such as beef were caught in a credit squeeze as short-term rates rose to extremely high levels. Unemployment also rose significantly. Unease within the ALP led to Barnard's defeat when Jim Cairns <b>challenged</b> <b>him</b> for his deputy leadership. Whitlam gave little help to his embattled deputy, who had formed {{the other half of the}} duumvirate.|$|E

During Cena's feud with Big Show, The Miz <b>challenged</b> <b>him</b> to a match on the April 27 episode of Raw, but as Cena was out due to injury, Miz claimed an unofficial win via forfeit and continued to do this over the following weeks, until Cena defeated him in a singles match at The Bash.|$|E

Later that night, Punk made his first title defense against JBL, who had <b>challenged</b> <b>him</b> shortly after his win. Punk continued to hold and defend the title until Unforgiven on September 7. Before the Championship Scramble match, Punk was attacked by The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase with Manu). Orton finished the assault by punting Punk in the head. Punk could {{not participate in the}} match due to the attack and so forfeited the title. He was replaced by Chris Jericho, who won the match and the title. He received a rematch eight days later on September 15, where he failed to regain the title in a steel cage match against Jericho.|$|E
