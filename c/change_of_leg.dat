40|$|Synopsis Locomotion in {{a complex}} {{environment}} is often not steady, but the mechanisms used by animals to power and control unsteady locomotion (stability and maneuverability) are not well understood. We use behavioral, morphological, and impulsive perturbations to determine the compensations used during unsteady locomotion. At the level both of the whole-body and of joints, quasi-stiffness models are useful for describing adjustments to the functioning <b>of</b> <b>legs</b> and joints during maneuvers. However, alterations to the mechanics <b>of</b> <b>legs</b> and joints often are distinct for different phases of the step cycle or for specific joints. For example, negotiating steps involves independent <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>leg</b> stiffness during compression and thrust phases of stance. Unsteady locomotion also involves parameters that {{are not part of}} the simplest reduced-parameter models of locomotion (e. g., the spring-loaded inverted pendulum) such as moments of the hip joint. Extensive coupling among translational and rotational parameters must be taken into account to stabilize locomotion or maneuver. For example, maneuvers with morphological perturbations (increased rotational inertial turns) involve changes to several aspects of movement, including the initial conditions of rotation and ground-reaction forces. Coupled changes to several parameters may be employed to control maneuvers on a trial-by-trial basis. Compensating for increased rotational inertia of the body during turns is facilitated by the opposing effects of several mechanical and behavioral parameters. However, the specific rules used by animals to control translation and rotation of the body to maintain stability or maneuver have not been fully characterized. We initiated direct-perturbation experiments to investigate th...|$|R

40|$|Weight loss in men is {{commonly}} observed during prolonged high altitude exposure {{as a result}} of a daily negative energy balance. Its amount depends mainly on duration of exposure, altitude reached, and level of physical activity. This reduction in body weight often comes with a loss of muscular mass, likely contributing to the decreased physical performance generally reported. Limited data is, however, available on body composition, functional capacity, and cardiopulmonary response to exercise after high altitude exposure in women. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of prolonged high altitude exposure on body composition and on cardiopulmonary response to maximal exercise in a group of young, moderately active women. Twelve female subjects, aged 21. 5 – 3. 1 (mean – SD), BMI 22. 1 – 1. 9 kg$m- 2 and Vo 2 max 33. 8 – 3. 5 mL$kg- 1 $min- 1, participated in this study, by residing for 21 days at high altitude (5050 m, Pyramid, EV-K 2 -CNR laboratory). Before and after high altitude exposure, all subjects underwent both a body composition evaluation using two methods (bioimpedance analysis and DEXA) and a functional evaluation based on a maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer with breath-by-breath gas analysis. After high altitude exposure, data showed a slight, nonsignificant reduction in body weight, with an average 3 : 2 reduction ratio between fat and fat-free mass evaluated by DEXA, in addition to a significant decrease in Vo 2 max on the cycle ergometer test (p < 0. 01).

Fresh red snow crabs were stored at − 20  °C for 7  weeks, and the leg muscle was separated by a no heating separation (NHS) method every week. During the storage, considerable loss <b>of</b> the <b>leg</b> muscle did not occur and microbiological risk was very low. In contrast, discoloration appeared at 2 -week storage on around carapace and the leg muscle turned yellow at storage 3 -week. In physiochemical parameters, protein and free amino acids gradually decreased with storage time, expected that proteolytic enzymes still activated at − 20  °C. At 4 -week storage, the sensory acceptance dropped down below point 4 as low as inedible and notable inflection points in pH and acidity were observed. The volatile base nitrogen was low, though a little increase was recorded. These results suggested that the maximal storable period at − 20  °C of the raw material was within 2  weeks and it was depended on external factor such as the discoloration.

By using these models, we show that running with compliant curved legs can be more efficient, robust with fast recovery behavior from perturbations than running with compliant straight legs. Moreover, the running performance can be further improved by tuning these design parameters in the context of running with rolling.

A new methodology is proposed to approach the “tired or heavy legs ” symptom. Seven females with this complaint applied a standard topical formulation during 28 days in one leg randomly chosen. Local blood flow records were obtained instantaneously and during postural change with a laser doppler flowmeter (LDF). High-frequency sonography and local morphometry were also obtained at Days 0, 14, and 28. When compared with D 0, LDF values present a significant decrease of both basal and dynamical values after Day 14 and Day 28 suggesting that this effect may result from the formulation application, also involving the related massage. Centimetric measurements and sonographic analysis also supported those inferences. The proposed methodology can evaluate the dynamical <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> “heavy <b>legs</b> ” symptom and eventually be very useful to assess the related claim support. Copyright © 2009 P. C.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{stochastic}} model and numerical simulation framework for a synthetic nanoscale walker {{that can be}} used to transport materials and information at superdiffusive rates in artificial molecular systems. Our multivalent random walker model describes the motion of a walker with a rigid, inert body and flexible, enzymatic legs. A leg can bind to and irreversibly modify surface-bound chemical substrate sites arranged as nanoscale tracks. As the legs attach to, modify, and detach from the sites, the walker moves along these tracks. Walkers are symmetrical and the tracks they walk on are unoriented, yet we show that under appropriate kinetic constraints the walkers can transform the chemical free energy in the surface sites into directional motion, and can do ordered work against an external load force. This shows that multivalent random walkers are a new type of molecular motor, useful for directional transport in nanoscale systems. We model the motion of multivalent random walkers as a continuous-time discrete-state Markov process. States in the process correspond to the chemical state <b>of</b> the <b>legs</b> and surface sites, and transitions represent discrete chemical <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>legs</b> binding to, unbinding from, and modifying the surface sites. The Markov property holds because we let the mechanical motion of the body and unattached legs come to equilibrium in between successive chemical steps, thus the transitions depend only on the current chemical state of the surface sites and attached legs. This coarse-grained model of walker motion allows us to use both equilibrium and non-equilibrium Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm approximates the motion of a walker's body and legs at a mechanical equilibrium, while the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm simulates the transient chemical dynamics of the walker stepping across the surface sites. Using these numerical techniques, we find that MVRWs move superdiffusively in the direction of unmodified substrate sites when there is a residence time bias between modified and unmodified sites. This superdiffusive motion persists when opposed by external load forces, showing that multivalent random walkers are molecular motors that can transform chemical free energy into ordered mechanical work. To produce these results we devised a distributed object-oriented framework for parallel simulation and analysis of the MVRW model. We use an object-relational mapping to persistently maintain all simulation-related objects as tuples in a relational database. We present a new object-relational mapping technique called the natural entity framework which disambiguates the semantics of object identity and uniqueness in the relational and object-oriented programming models. Using the natural entity framework we are able to guarantee the uniqueness of mappings between data stored as objects in the relational database and external data stored in non-transactionally-secured HDF 5 data files.

The range of within-species body lengths varied from 1. 6 mm to 4 mm. As worker size increased, the gaster tended to make up a larger proportion of body length, usually at the cost of the petiole, and rarely at the cost of head length or mesosoma length. In most, the relative volume of the gaster increased and that of the head and mesosoma decreased. Most also showed an increasingly "humped" mesosoma. For all species, head shape changed from barrel-shaped to heart-shaped as worker size increased. Antennae became relatively shorter as the relative size of the club decreased. Shape <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> the <b>legs</b> were more variable. S. geminata was exceptional in the extreme nature of its head shape change, and was the only species in which relative head volume increased and gaster volume decreased with increasing body size. With the exception of S. geminata, the allometric rules governing shape are remarkably similar across species, suggesting a genus-level developmental scheme that is not easily modified by evolution. It also suggests that the evolution of shape is highly constrained by these conserved growth rules, and that it acts primarily (perhaps only) through allometric growth. The results are discussed in light of the growth of imaginal discs in a resource-limited body (the pupa). The substantial variation of allometries within species and across localities is also discussed in relation to using allometric patterns to identify species or to construct phylogenies...|$|R
