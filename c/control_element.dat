40|$|The genetic {{basis for}} a {{striking}} aleurone color variegation of a maize population from Colombia is described. The variegation {{is the result of}} the interaction of a particular r allele, designated r-cu, and a specific factor, Fcu (Factor Cuna), that collectively compose a <b>controlling</b> <b>element</b> system. In the absence of Fcu, a variable dilute (nonvariegated) pigmentation is expressed in the aleurone. The degree of variegation is determined by differences in the dosage of the Fcu element; differences in variegation between kernels with one r-cu vs. two r-cu's cannot be detected. Because of the specificity of the interaction, Fcu is different from the three other well-known <b>controlling</b> <b>elements,</b> Dt, Ac and En(=Spm), and therefore represents a fourth <b>controlling</b> <b>element</b> system in maize. In addition to Fcu, the Cuna tribal maize contains two other <b>controlling</b> <b>elements,</b> Dt and a very weak En.

2500|$|An {{airbrush}} {{works by}} passing {{a stream of}} fast moving (compressed) air through a venturi, which creates a local reduction in air pressure (suction) that allows paint to be pulled from an interconnected reservoir at normal atmospheric pressure. The high velocity of the air atomizes the paint into very tiny droplets as it blows past a very fine paint-metering component. [...] The paint is carried onto paper or other surfaces. The operator controls the amount of paint using a variable trigger which opens {{more or less a}} very fine tapered needle that is the <b>control</b> <b>element</b> of the paint-metering component. An extremely fine degree of atomization is what allows an artist to create such smooth blending effects using the airbrush.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the preliminary {{results of an}} experiment that was performed to study {{the effect of the}} break frequency of <b>controlled</b> <b>element</b> dynamics that are representative for conventional aileron-to-roll dynamics on manual control behavior during compensatory target-following. For frequencies below the break frequency – which results from the roll subsidence eigenmode – such aircraft roll dynamics typically approach those of a single integrator, while for higher frequencies they are approximately those of a double integrator. Previous tracking experiments with such <b>controlled</b> <b>element</b> dynamics have shown some results that disagree with the work ofMcRuer et al., who investigated manual control behavior for control of pure single and double integrator dynamics, most notably lower pilot-vehicle system crossover frequencies than would be expected. An experimental evaluation of aircraft roll dynamics with three different break frequencies, and pure single and double integrator dynamics for comparison, showed marked effects of <b>controlled</b> <b>element</b> dynamics on both tracking performance and manual control behavior. Tracking performance and crossover frequencies were found to consistently decrease with decreasing <b>controlled</b> <b>element</b> bandwidth. In addition, the two different forcing function signal bandwidths evaluated in the experiment, revealed further adaptation of human dynamics to the combination of <b>controlled</b> <b>element</b> and forcing function characteristics, of which part could not be explained by the available literature...|$|R

40|$|The yeast GAL 1 and GAL 10 {{genes are}} {{transcribed}} at a remarkably low basal level when galactose is unavailable and are induced by over 4 {{orders of magnitude}} when it becomes available. Approximately six negative <b>control</b> <b>elements</b> (designated GAL operators GALO 1 to GALO 6) are located adjacent to or overlapping four binding sites for the transcription activator GAL 4 in the GAL upstream activating sequence UASG. The negative <b>control</b> <b>elements</b> contribute to {{the broad range of}} inducibility of GAL 1 and GAL 10 by inhibiting two GAL 4 /galactose-independent activating elements (GAE 1 and GAE 2) in UASG. In turn, multiple GAL 4 -binding sites in UASG are necessary for GAL 4 to overcome repression by the negative <b>control</b> <b>elements</b> under fully inducing conditions. When glucose in addition to galactose is available (repressing conditions), the ability of GAL 4 to activate transcription is diminished {{as a result of its}} reduced affinity for DNA and the reduced availability of inducer. Under these conditions, the negative <b>control</b> <b>elements</b> inhibit transcriptional activation from the glucose-attenuated GAL 4 sites, thus accounting at least in part for glucose repression acting in cis.
