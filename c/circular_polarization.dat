25|$|Normally, a {{much smaller}} {{fraction}} of <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> is found in starlight. Serkowski, Mathewson and Ford measured the polarization of 180 stars in UBVR filters. They found a maximum fractional <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> of , in the R filter.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} figure, the two {{orthogonal}} components {{have the same}} amplitudes and are 90° out of phase. In this case, one component is zero when the other component is at maximum or minimum amplitude. There are two possible phase relationships that satisfy this requirement: the x component can be 90° ahead of the y component {{or it can be}} 90° behind the y component. In this special case, the electric vector traces out a circle in the plane, so this polarization is called <b>circular</b> <b>polarization.</b> The rotation direction in the circle depends on which of the two phase relationships exists and corresponds to right-hand <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> and left-hand <b>circular</b> <b>polarization.</b>|$|E

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to create a circularly birefringent optical fiber just using an ordinary (circularly symmetric) single-mode fiber and twisting it, thus creating internal torsional stress. That causes the phase velocity of right and left hand <b>circular</b> <b>polarizations</b> to significantly differ. Thus the two <b>circular</b> <b>polarizations</b> propagate with little crosstalk in between them ...|$|R

25|$|In Brookhaven, Paul {{attempted}} {{to find a}} possible parity admixture in an excited state of a radioactive hafnium isotope, which would manifest itself by a small <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> of the emitted gamma radiation. The result was negative: there was no <b>circular</b> <b>polarization.</b> While at Brookhaven, Paul also published a summarizing article on the shapes of beta spectra which he had already begun at Seibersdorf.|$|E
25|$|The <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> of starlight {{has been}} {{observed}} to {{be a function of}} the linear polarization of starlight.|$|E
25|$|Circularly {{polarized}} light {{can be converted}} into linearly {{polarized light}} by passing it through a quarter-wave plate. Passing linearly polarized light through a quarter-wave plate with its axes at 45° to its polarization axis will convert it to <b>circular</b> <b>polarization.</b> In fact, {{this is the most}} common way of producing <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> in practice. Note that passing linearly polarized light through a quarter-wave plate at an angle other than 45° will generally produce elliptical polarization.|$|E

2500|$|By the Faraday effect, where a {{magnetic}} field causes some materials to become circularly birefringent (having slightly different indices of refraction for left- and right-handed <b>circular</b> <b>polarizations),</b> making the material optically active until the field is removed; ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>polarization</b> is a {{limiting}} {{case of the}} more general condition of elliptical polarization. The other special case is the easier-to-understand linear polarization.|$|E
25|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>polarization</b> {{is often}} {{encountered}} {{in the field of}} optics and in this section, the electromagnetic wave will be simply referred to as light.|$|E
25|$|In all {{electromagnetic}} radiation, {{the electric}} field is {{perpendicular to the}} direction of propagation, and the electric field direction is the polarization of the wave. For a transmitted radar signal, the polarization can be controlled to yield different effects. Radars use horizontal, vertical, linear, and <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> to detect different types of reflections. For example, <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> is used to minimize the interference caused by rain. Linear polarization returns usually indicate metal surfaces. Random polarization returns usually indicate a fractal surface, such as rocks or soil, and are used by navigation radars.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{one can use}} as basis {{functions}} any pair of {{orthogonal polarization}} states, not just linear polarizations. For instance, choosing right and left <b>circular</b> <b>polarizations</b> as basis functions simplifies the solution of problems involving circular birefringence (optical activity) or circular dichroism.|$|R

25|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>polarization</b> may be {{referred}} to as right-handed or left-handed, and clockwise or anti-clockwise, depending on the direction in which the electric field vector rotates. Unfortunately, two opposing historical conventions exist.|$|E
25|$|Although now obsolete, CRT {{computer}} displays {{suffered from}} reflection {{by the glass}} envelope, causing glare from room lights and consequently poor contrast. Several anti-reflection solutions were employed to ameliorate this problem. One solution utilized the principle of reflection of circularly polarized light. A circular polarizing filter {{in front of the}} screen allows for the transmission of (say) only right circularly polarized room light. Now, right circularly polarized light (depending on the convention used) has its electric (and magnetic) field direction rotating clockwise while propagating in the +z direction. Upon reflection, the field still has the same direction of rotation, but now propagation is in the −z direction making the reflected wave left circularly polarized. With the right <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> filter placed in front of the reflecting glass, the unwanted light reflected from the glass will thus be in very polarization state that is blocked by that filter, eliminating the reflection problem. The reversal of <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> on reflection and elimination of reflections in this manner can be easily observed by looking in a mirror while wearing 3-D movie glasses which employ left- and right-handed <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> in the two lenses. Closing one eye, the other eye will see a reflection in which it cannot see itself; that lens appears black. However the other lens (of the closed eye) will have the correct <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> allowing the closed eye to be easily seen by the open one.|$|E
40|$|Polarization {{of light}} emitted by a {{semiconductor}} microcavity in {{the regime of}} a resonant parametric scattering of the exciton polaritons shows extremely strong and unusual dependence on the polarization of pumping light. This dependence is interpreted here using the pseudospin model and {{in the framework of}} a quasiclassical formalism where the parametric scattering is described as resonant four-wave mixing. We show that the optically induced splitting of the exciton-polariton eigenstate, both in linear and <b>circular</b> <b>polarizations,</b> is responsible for the observed polarization effects. The splitting in <b>circular</b> <b>polarizations,</b> achieving 0. 5 meV, has been detected experimentally, while the splitting in linear polarizations, which is much weaker, only manifests itself in the pseudospin dynamics of the exciton polaritons...|$|R

25|$|Media {{in which}} {{transmission}} of one polarization mode is preferentially reduced are called dichroic or diattenuating. Like birefringence, diattenuation {{can be with}} respect to linear polarization modes (in a crystal) or <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> modes (usually in a liquid).|$|E
25|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>polarization</b> of {{zodiacal light}} and Milky Way diffuse galactic light was {{measured}} at wavelength of 550nm by Wolstencroft and Kemp. They found values of , which {{is higher than}} for ordinary stars, presumably because of multiple scattering from dust grains.|$|E
25|$|In electrodynamics, <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> of an {{electromagnetic}} wave is a polarization state in which, at each point, the electric {{field of the}} wave has a constant magnitude but its direction rotates with time at a steady rate in a plane perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} wave.|$|E
30|$|By {{means of}} a model of {{ionosphere}} associated with a ray tracing software, theoretical capacities for different HF MIMO channels are then estimated. A suboptimal solution consisting in the transmission of two complementary <b>circular</b> <b>polarizations</b> appears as a balanced trade off between capacity gain and complexity.|$|R
50|$|Polarization {{reconfigurable}} antennas {{are capable}} of switching between different polarization modes. The capability of switching between horizontal, vertical and <b>circular</b> <b>polarizations</b> {{can be used to}} reduce polarization mismatch losses in portable devices. Polarization reconfigurability can be provided by changing the balance between the different modes of a multimode structure.|$|R

Comment: 8 page...|$|R
25|$|A {{homogeneous}} circular polarizer passes one handedness of <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> unaltered {{and blocks}} the other handedness. This {{is similar to}} the way that a linear polarizer would fully pass one angle of linearly polarized light unaltered, but would fully block any linearly polarized light that was orthogonal to it.|$|E
25|$|Water-air {{interfaces}} provide {{another source}} of <b>circular</b> <b>polarization.</b> Sunlight that gets scattered back up towards the surface is linearly polarized. If this light is then totally internally reflected back down, its vertical component undergoes a phase shift. To an underwater observer looking up, the faint light outside Snell's window therefore is (partially) circularly polarized.|$|E
25|$|Consider {{a purely}} {{polarized}} monochromatic wave. If {{one were to}} plot the electric field vector over one cycle of oscillation, an ellipse would generally be obtained, as {{is shown in the}} figure, corresponding to a particular state of elliptical polarization.
