50|$|Except for {{the engine}} change and its Townend ring cowling, the YP-20 was not {{drastically}} {{different from the}} P-6 from which both it and the P-11 derived, though the YP-20 had more fin and less rudder area, and featured a steerable tailwheel, rather than the original skid. Later, a crankcase <b>cover,</b> <b>gear</b> strut fairings, and wheel pants were added.|$|E
40|$|Induction {{hardening}} is a {{heat treating}} technique {{that can be}} used to selectively harden portions of a gear, such as the fl anks, roots and tips of teeth, providing improved hardness, wear resistance, and contact fatigue strength without affecting the metallurgy of the core and other parts of the component that don’t require change. This article provides an overview of the process and special considerations for heat treating <b>gears.</b> Part I <b>covers</b> <b>gear</b> materials, desired microsctructure, coil design and tooth-by-tooth induction hardening.

5000|$|Gear or chain {{systems are}} also used to connect the {{crankshaft}} to the camshaft at the correct timing. However, gears and shafts constrain the relative location of the crankshaft and camshafts. Even where the crankshaft and camshaft(s) are very close together, as in pushrod engines, most engine designers use a short chain drive rather than a direct gear drive. This is because gear drives suffer from frequent torque reversal as the cam profiles [...] "kick back" [...] against the drive from the crank, leading to excessive noise and wear. Fibre or nylon <b>covered</b> <b>gears,</b> with more resilience, are often used instead of steel gears where direct drive is used. Commercial engines and aircraft engines use steel gears only, as a fibre or nylon coated gear can fail suddenly and without warning.|$|R

50|$|Fitness {{modelling}} {{focuses on}} displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is heavier due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, {{they have a}} lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising. Sometimes they are certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in fitness and figure competitions. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While {{there is a large}} market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models.

50|$|This {{difference}} in perspective also affects gameplay. Third-person shooters allow players {{to see the}} area surrounding the avatar more clearly. This viewpoint facilitates more interaction between the character and their surrounding environment, {{such as the use}} of tactical <b>cover</b> in <b>Gears</b> of War, or navigating tight quarters. As such, the third-person perspective is better for interacting with objects in the game world, such as jumping on platforms, engaging in close combat, or driving a vehicle.

50|$|Fortunately, one {{advantage}} the {{drive on the}} BL2 locomotives model, {{was the fact that}} the trucks and worm <b>gears</b> <b>covers</b> were exposed.

Getting this weight out required several screws to be removed, some hidden under the fuel tank. The weight also guided the wires around the locomotive. This made dissembling the locomotive for maintenance difficult and frustrating.|$|R
5000|$|A {{detailed}} Deluxe sized toy, Scorponok is {{a mechanical}} scorpion <b>covered</b> in <b>gears</b> and military warning symbols.

Pushing on the elongated rear of his stinger will cause it to slide forward until it hits a stopper. In this mode, he can combine with Voyager Blackout figure (in helicopter mode) so that when Blackouts rotors are turned, Scorponoks claws will also rotate. The face slides down on to the underbelly, the claws are rotated down to face the new [...] "front" [...] of the figure, and {{the sides of the}} scorpion mode detach and rotate down to become the new legs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{determinants}} of failure among individual UK public and private companies are examined, over the period from 1991 to 2001. Using information on profitability, interest <b>cover,</b> capital <b>gearing,</b> liquidity, company size, industry, whether a firm is a subsidiary and overall economic conditions, {{it is possible to}} construct estimates of the probability of failure for individual companies. These are used to calculate each company's debt at risk: the probability of failure multiplied by its outstanding debt. By summing the firm-level debt at risk over all companies it is possible to produce an aggregate measure of financial risk that takes account of how debt is distributed across individual companies. Aggregate debt at risk, as a percentage of total debt, has fallen from the levels reached in the early 1990 s and has remained relatively stable despite the build-up in corporate debt since then. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of the micro-dimple texture on the {{friction}} and surface temperature performances of a ball-on-disk contact, operating under the speed and load ranges that <b>cover</b> typical <b>gearing</b> applications. Circular shaped micro-dimple arrays with different dimple center distances and dimple depths are implemented on the ball surface to quantify the impacts of these two parameters on the friction coefficient and the maximum ball surface temperature. In addition, the contacts of three surface texture combinations, namely micro-dimpled and polished ball surface versus polished disk surface, polished ball surface versus polished disk surface and ground ball surface versus ground disk surface, are compared to demonstrate any beneficial or detrimental effect of micro-dimples in heavily loaded high speed applications. This study adopts a thermal mixed EHL point contact model, whose capability and accuracy have been well demonstrated by comparing to the experimental measurements, to quantify the deterministic tribological behavior within the contact, allowing the exploration of the underlying mechanism that governs the role of micro-dimples in the elastohydrodynamic lubrication...|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, Konami's Metal Gear Solid for the PlayStation {{featured}} a cover mechanic, though its only function was to peek around walls {{to look out}} for enemies. Seeing as how the game was mostly stealth-oriented, the cover system served little combat purpose. Rather than a button, taking cover was initiated simply by continuously shifting Solid Snake towards a wall, instantly having him take <b>cover.</b> Metal <b>Gear</b> Solid is credited with popularizing the hiding-behind-cover mechanic. Splinter Cell, an Xbox game released after Metal Gear Solid in 2002, employed a similar stealth-oriented cover system. Also in 1998, Thief: The Dark Project was released by Looking Glass Studios. It also had its own cover mechanic where the player is required to sneak and duck behind corners while carefully observing enemy guard patrols. It {{featured a}} [...] "detection gauge" [...] that would measure how visible the player's avatar was, so players were required to seek concealment and darkness and move slowly avoid making too much noise, to avoid detection by enemies that were superior to the player avatar in open combat capabilities.|$|R
