5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the <b>coasting</b> <b>trade</b> when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and mooring rings, would significantly reduce the risk to shipping.|$|E

The <b>coasting</b> <b>trade</b> to serve the islands was kept up by the Glenlight Shipping Company of Greenock until in 1993 the government withdrew subsidies and, unable to compete with road transport using subsidised ferries, the service ended.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the State of Connecticut's {{ratification}} of the American constitution in 1781, many of the local farmers held shares in vessels trading at Newfield Harbor or had begun trading in their own name. Newfield initially expanded around the <b>coasting</b> <b>trade</b> with Boston, New York, and Baltimore and the international trade with the West Indies. The commercial activity of the village was clustered around the wharves on {{the west bank of the}} Pequonnock, while the churches were erected inland on Broad Street. In 1800, the village became the Borough of Bridgeport, the first so incorporated in the state. It was named for the Newfield or Lottery Bridge across the Pequonnock, connecting the wharves on its east and west banks. Bridgeport Bank was established in 1806. In 1821, the township of Bridgeport became independent of Stratford.|$|E

25|$|The puffers {{developed}} from the , small single masted sailing barges which took most of the <b>coasting</b> <b>trade.</b> The original puffer was the Thomas, an iron canal boat of 1856, less than 66ft (20 m) long to fit in the Forth and Clyde Canal locks, powered by a simple steam engine without a condenser, since as it drew fresh water from the canal {{there was no need}} to economise on water use. Once steam had been used by the engine, it was simply exhausted up the funnel in a series of puffs as the piston stroked. As well as the visual sight of a series of steam puffs following the boat, the simple engines made a characteristic puffing sound. By the 1870s similar boats were being adapted for use beyond the canal and fitted with condensers so that they no longer puffed, but the name stuck. Some non-condensing puffers (included those with compound engines) were built until the 1920s when purely canal traffic decreased and the vast majority of coasters had to operate in sea water. A derrick was added to the single mast to lift cargo.|$|E
25|$|Following the American Revolution, many ships used as privateers {{were too}} large for short voyages in the <b>coasting</b> <b>trade,</b> and their owners {{determined}} to open new avenues of trade to distant countries. The young men of the town, fresh from service on the armed ships of Salem, were eager to embark in such ventures. Captain Nathaniel Silsbee, his first mate Charles Derby, and second mate Richard J. Cleveland were not yet twenty years old when they set sail on a nineteen-month voyage that was perhaps the first from the newly independent America to the East Indies. In 1795, Captain Jonathan Carnes set sail for Sumatra in the Malay Archipelago on his secret voyage for pepper; nothing was heard from him until eighteen months later, when he entered with a cargo of pepper in bulk, {{the first to be}} so imported into the country, and which sold at the extraordinary profit of seven hundred per cent. The Empress of China, formerly a privateer, was refitted as the first American ship to sail from New York to China. By 1790, Salem had become the sixth largest city in the country, and a world-famous seaport—particularly in the China Trade, along with exporting codfish to Europe and the West Indies, importing sugar and molasses from the West Indies, tea from China, and products depicted on the city seal from the East Indies – in particular Sumatran pepper. Salem ships also visited Africa – Zanzibar in particular, Russia, Japan, and Australia.|$|E

2500|$|The Colonist {{left the}} Tuscars, being the last land {{seen on the}} British coast, on the 18th of December last, and. under all the circumstances, may be {{considered}} {{to have made a}} most successful voyage out. She is but a small schooner, of only 105 tons, but she withstood wonderfully the various winds and weather which she encountered in the different latitudes, and proved herself a capital little vessel in sailing qualities and otherwise. In the tropics she was becalmed for about a fortnight, and when off Kerguelen Island met with a very violent gale, during the prevalence of which she shipped a heavy sea, but was in no way disabled, and she made out Stewart's Island on the 13th of this month. The Colonist was only launched shortly before departure, her builders being Messrs. Denny and Rankin, Dumbarton. As she is exceedingly well fitted for the <b>coasting</b> <b>trade,</b> it is probable that she will be retained as a regular trader between this and other New Zealand ports.|$|E

[...] While no date is given for the letter, the location of Mill's reference to it suggests that it was sent before 1677, perhaps as early as 1675. Francis Parkman says that by 1677, [...] "four vessels of 25 to 40 tons had been built for the lake Ontario and the river St. Lawrence." [...] H. W. Beckwith says that in September, 1678, La Salle [...] "already had three small vessels on Lake Ontario, which he had made use of in a <b>coasting</b> <b>trade</b> with the Indians." [...] None of these sources ascribe a name to any of these vessels. While the journals of Tonti, Hennepin, and LeClercq (participants with La Salle) do mention a little vessel of 10 tons, none of them apply a name to it.|$|E
