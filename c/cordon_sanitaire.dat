5|$|The Centre Democrats did {{not gain}} enough votes for {{parliamentary}} {{representation in the}} 1986 general election, but Janmaat won back his seat after the following election in 1989. In 1994 he was joined by two additional representatives won by the party. The CD was subject to a <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> by the other parties in Parliament, although some parties rather sought to confront it following its 1994 success. The CD failed to win any seats in the 1998 election, and it fell into disarray until it was finally dissolved in 2002.|$|E

This marked the start of prosecutions of Centre Democrats party members on charges of racism, as well as the decision by the other parties in Parliament and government to place a <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> around the party.|$|E
5|$|All {{significant}} Flemish {{political parties}} {{were reluctant to}} enter coalitions with the Vlaams Blok. Following a 1989 agreement, known as the <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire,</b> the party was effectively blocked from entering any level of government.

The ruling was made definite on 9 November 2004, and the party shortly after reorganised itself as the Vlaams Belang. By 2004, the party had arguably become the single most popular Flemish party in Belgium, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate, as well as being {{one of the most successful}} radical right-wing populist parties in Europe as a whole.|$|E

In 2001, the party was forced to alter its political program, as according to the laws for party financing, it was not compatible with the European Treaty on Human Rights. In the 2004 Flemish Parliament election, the party finally became the single largest party group in parliament. The party was invited by the formateur for government discussions, only to find that its differences with the other parties was insurmountable, resulting in the three traditional parties forming a majority government, retaining the <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire.</b> By this time, the party had nevertheless become the very most popular Flemish party in Belgium, being supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate.|$|E

5000|$|The 1918 flu {{pandemic}} spread so rapidly that, in general, {{there was no}} time to implement <b>cordons</b> <b>sanitaires.</b> However, to prevent an introduction of the infection, residents of Gunnison, Colorado isolated themselves from the surrounding area for two months at the end of 1918. All highways were barricaded near the county lines. Train conductors warned all passengers that if they stepped outside of the train in Gunnison, they would be arrested and quarantined for five days. As a result of this protective sequestration, no one died of influenza in Gunnison during the epidemic.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the cause}} of the plague was unknown to contemporaries, with speculations {{reaching}} from religious causes over [...] "bad air" [...] to contaminated clothes, the only means of fighting the disease was containment, to separate the ill from the healthy. <b>Cordons</b> <b>sanitaire</b> were established around infected towns like Stralsund and Königsberg; one was also established around the whole Duchy of Prussia and another one between Scania and the Danish isles along the Sound, with Saltholm as the central quarantine station.

When the plague finally faded out in Hamburg in March 1714, ~10,000 people had died of the disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{coalition}} caused widespread outrage both in Austria and {{the rest}} of Europe. The heads of government of the other fourteen EU members decided to cease cooperation with the Austrian government, as it was felt in many countries that the <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> against coalitions with parties considered as right-wing extremists, which had mostly held in Western Europe since 1945, had been breached. For several months, other national leaders shunned diplomatic contacts with members of the Schüssel government. Supporters of the government often blamed social democrats and President Thomas Klestil for these sanctions, and questioned their loyalty to the country.|$|E
25|$|When news of {{the plague}} in Poland arrived in the Kingdom of Prussia, then still neutral in the war, {{precautions}} were taken to prevent it spreading across the border. From 1704, health certificates were compulsory for travellers from Poland. From 1707, a broad <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> extended around {{the border of the}} former Duchy of Prussia, and those crossing into the Prussian exclave were quarantined. Yet the border was long and wooded, and not all roads could be guarded; thus bridges were demolished, lesser roads blocked, and orders were given to hang people avoiding the guarded crossings and burn or fumigate all incoming goods. There were, however, many exemptions for people with cross-border estates or occupations, who were allowed to pass freely.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} I examine, through {{a case study}} of {{newspaper}} re-presentations of the Kasheche-wan crisis in late 2005, how the discursive discourse nodes of the academy/medicine and the mass media phenomenologically create and circulate conceptualizations of the “disordered” Aboriginal (Waldram 2004). To invoke the “disordered” Aboriginal, texts stemming from the academy/medicine and such innocuous products as the daily newspaper draw delineations between seemingly “unhealthy” Aboriginal peoples and their “healthy” mainstream coun-terparts (Crawford 1994). As I discuss in the article, these binaries come into relief during a health crisis and the mass media coverage of the events at Kashechewan invoke spatial and cultural metaphors to create native=reserve=poor=sick associations. The drawing of such figurative <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaires</b> rests upon static notions of Aboriginal culture, which stem from early colonial renditions of Aboriginal peoples (Doxtator 1992). Ultimately, the textual co-lonialism unearthed in this article works to perpetuate policy decisions that reinforce the subordinate status of Aboriginal peoples in Canada...|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} effects of {{inclusion}} and exclusion on the policy agendas of radical right parties. Radical right parties face diverging political opportunity structures in Western Europe. In some countries, the prospect of office has become a realistic option {{since the beginning of}} this century; in other countries radical right parties remain ostracised by mainstream parties. Research has focused mainly on the electoral effects of inclusion and exclusion strategies. Systematic analyses of the effects on policy agendas are scarce. This article focuses on the policy positions of radical right parties with respect to the key issues of immigration and integration. The finding is that ostracised parties have not changed much over time, but {{there is no evidence that}} <b>cordons</b> <b>sanitaires</b> have a freezing effect. Contrary to expectations, non-ostracised parties have not become more moderate over time. After the turn of the millennium, non-ostracised radical right parties have become just as radical as their ostracised cousins...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} processes of reform in disease {{management in the}} Viceroyalty of New Spain in the eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. Especially under the enlightened rule of Charles III (1759 - 1788), onerous programs of epidemic management were introduced into communities accustomed to resolving disease in municipalities, villages, barrios, parishes, and homes. The objections of these communities to the interventions of the state led to an early and rapid adjustment in the official policy. In place of disruptive <b>cordons</b> <b>sanitaires</b> and isolation of patients in makeshift infirmaries, the viceregal government turned to immunization, where religious symbols, personnel, rituals, charity, and institutions helped frame modern medicine for lay communities. Bourbon reforms {{in the realm of}} public health ultimately became a reality through a modified "paternalistic" program of medical provision. This program was a natural outcome of centuries of Habsburg rule, in which indigenous villages had been accorded certain legal and fiduciary considerations and deemed especially vulnerable to disease, intemperate reform, and intervention from outsiders. Bourbon innovations in public health of necessity respected these longstanding arrangements or risked failure. The injunction to provide and receive charity in crisis, and the belief that ceremonial performance {{was the best way to}} effect conversions to novel practices such as vaccine, led to a sustained effort to transfer sacred status to the new components of public health policy. As one crown attorney observed, administrators had been reminded by subjects of the obligation to make use of the "sacred ties of civil society" whenever possible. Historical studies of public health have tended to stress innovations in hygiene and urban sanitation in the nineteenth century. This study shows that significant change occurred earlier and actively involved non-state actors in adapting and popularizing medicine at the local level. By considering the numerous sites where medical science, ideology, and techniques were tested and critiqued, it seeks a more adequate view of scientific culture and enlightened medical programs as the product of diverse laypeople, multiple epistemologies, and longstanding colonial practice...|$|R
25|$|In 1965, Mitterrand was {{the first}} left-wing {{politician}} who saw the presidential election by universal suffrage {{as a way to}} defeat the opposition leadership. Not a member of any specific political party, his candidacy for presidency was accepted by all left-wing parties (the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), French Communist Party (PCF), Radical-Socialist Party (PR) and Unified Socialist Party (PSU)). He ended the <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> of the PCF which the party had been subject to since 1947. For the SFIO leader Guy Mollet, Mitterrand's candidacy prevented Gaston Defferre, his rival in the SFIO, from running for the presidency. Furthermore, Mitterrand was a lone figure, so he did not appear as a danger to the left-wing parties' staff members.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after a Prussian {{official}} in Soldau forwarded the information that on 18 August 1708 the plague had reached the village of Piekielko on the Polish side of the border, the epidemic had crossed into the village of Bialutten on the Prussian side, killing most of its inhabitants within a month. The Prussian authorities reacted by containing the village with a palisade; however, the survivors, led by the local reverend, had already taken refuge in the nearby woods. On 13 September 1708, a Prussian official from Hohenstein reported that the plague {{had been brought to}} this small border town by the son of the local hatter returning from Polish service. By December, 400 people had died in Hohenstein. While the plague faded out during the hard winter, food became scarce due to war contributions and conscription, and the <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> and the respective restrictions were lifted by edict on 12 July 1709.|$|E
25|$|In Scania (Skåne), {{the plague}} arrived on 20 (O.S.)/ 30 November 1710, when an {{infected}} Västanå boatman {{returned home from}} the navy. Scania had not yet fully recovered from the Scanian War when its population was further weakened by a measles epidemic in 1706, a crop failure and the outbreak of smallpox in 1708–1709, an invasion of the Danish army in 1709, the expulsion of this army after the battle of Helsingborg, followed by conscriptions into the Swedish army and an outbreak of typhus in 1710. While Scania was protected from an infection from the north by a <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> between it and Småland, the plague came by sea and made landfall not only in Västanå, but also in January 1711 in Domsten in Allerum parish, where the locals had ignored the ban on contact with their relatives and friends on the Danish side of the Sound, most notably in the infected area around Helsingør (Elsinore); the third {{starting point for the}} plague in Scania was Ystad, where on 19 June an infected soldier arrived from Swedish Pomerania. The plague remained in Scania until 1713, probably 1714.|$|E
40|$|The current {{outbreak}} of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa is spiraling out of control, {{but it never}} had to happen. What can the international community do now to bring the epidemic under control, {{and how can we}} prevent the next one? The counties most affected by Ebola (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone), rank among the lowest in global development, lacking essential public health infrastructure. If the affected countries had adequate public health systems, they probably would have contained Ebola within rural settings, avoiding the first outbreak in major urban areas. More than 130 health workers have died from Ebola during the current outbreak, depleting already scarce human resources. Hospitals lack personal protective equipment and safe isolation facilities, becoming amplification points for transmission. The absence of basic public health infrastructure means that countries have instead often resorted to military-led <b>cordons</b> <b>sanitaires,</b> without ensuring access to basic necessities, such as food, clean water, and health care. This article proposes an International Health Systems Fund, encompassing both emergency response capabilities and enduring health-system development. The WHO’s Ebola response roadmap estimates than an initial US$ 490 million in global resources over 6 months would be needed to curb the outbreak, although the total costs are likely to be considerably higher. What is needed is a standing crisis fund to ensure surge capacity {{in the event of a}} WHO declared Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To prevent future epidemics, and to provide health services for the entire population, we also urgently need a sustainable International Health Systems Fund to build long-term capacity. This fund, however, would require multibillion-dollar investment. Although large, the international community has mobilized before on this scale through PEPFAR and the Global Fund. The West African Ebola epidemic should spark a badly needed global course correction that would favor strong health infrastructure. It would encourage high-income countries to meet their International Health Regulations obligations to mobilize financial resources and provide technical land logistical support to develop, strengthen, and maintain public health capacity, especially in lower-income countries. Although the scale of investment would be substantial, it is a wise and affordable investment in containing global health hazards, and moving towards a right-to-health based universal health coverage...|$|R
25|$|Already in 1708, the Danish Politi- och Kommercekollegium {{proposed}} shielding the Danish islands with {{a marine}} <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire,</b> with dedicated ports for inspection of incoming ships from the Baltic Sea and a quarantine station on Saltholm, {{a small island}} in the Sound between Copenhagen on Zealand (Sjælland) and Malmö in Scania. These measures were not implemented immediately, as the plague had not yet reached the Baltic coast. On 16 and 19 August 1709, however, the king ordered {{the implementation of a}} revised plan, and a quarantine station was built on Saltholm for goods and crews of ships coming to Denmark from the infected ports of Danzig and Königsberg, while their ships were meanwhile cleansed in Christianshavn; Dutch traders sailing from infected ports to the North Sea were to pay the Sound Dues on a special boat off the coast at Helsingør. When the plague did not arrive in Denmark, though, Saltholm effectively fell out of use by 3 July 1710, when only three people were left in the station. The main problem then was rather the lost Battle of Helsingborg and the aggressive type of typhus that the retreating Danish soldiers carried to Zealand from Scania.|$|E
25|$|In August 1709, {{the plague}} {{arrived in the}} small Swedish Pomeranian town of (Alt-)Damm (now Dąbie) on the eastern bank of the Oder river, rapidly killing 500 inhabitants. Stettin (now Szczecin), {{the capital city of}} Swedish Pomerania located on the {{opposite}} bank of the river, reacted by isolating the town with a guarded <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire.</b> Precautions taken in Stettin since the arrival of the plague in Danzig included restrictions for travellers, especially soldiers' families returning from Swedish-occupied Poland after the lost Battle of Poltava (8 July 1709), and a ban on fruits in the town's markets, since fruits were believed to transmit the disease. According to Zapnik (2006), the returning soldiers' wives who had contact with the plague-stricken areas around Poznań were most likely the transmitters of the plague to Pomerania. After the outbreak in Damm, the mail route connecting Stettin with Stargard in the adjacent Prussian province of Pomerania via Damm was relocated to Podejuch. Despite the precautions, the plague broke out in Warsow, just north of Stettin, {{and by the end of}} September also inside Stettin's walls, transmitted by a local woman who had provided food to her son in Damm. As in Danzig (see above), the city council downplayed the plague cases to not impair Stettin's trade, but also set up a health commission and pest houses and hired personnel to deal with the infected.|$|E
25|$|The next large town to {{the east}} of Danzig was Königsberg in the Prussian kingdom, which had so far profited from the war by taking over some of the Swedish and Polish Livonian trade. In {{preparation}} for the plague, a Collegium Sanitatis (health commission) was set up, including physicians from the university and leading civilian and military officials of the town. The plague arrived in August 1709, most probably carried by a Danzig sailor. The provincial government was exiled to Wehlau while the chancellor, von Kreytzen, remained in Königsberg and continued to work as the chairman of the Collegium Sanitatis, which met daily. The city walls were manned by the military, the burghers were conscripted into neighborhood watches, medical and other personnel was hired, dressed in black waxed clothes and housed in separate buildings. While at first the city authorities downplayed the plague, which had reached a peak in early October and then declined, this approach was abandoned when the death toll again started to rise significantly in November. Without prior public announcement, a <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> was implemented around the city, sealing it off completely from the surrounding countryside from 14/15 November until 21 December 1709. When the plague had fully retreated from Königsberg by mid-1710, more than 9,500 townspeople had died, about a quarter of its population.|$|E
25|$|James II's ill-advised {{attempts}} to Catholicise the army, government {{and other institutions}} had proved increasingly unpopular with his mainly Protestant subjects. His open Catholicism and his dealings with Catholic France had also strained relations between England and the Dutch Republic, but because his daughter Mary was the Protestant heir to the English throne, her husband William of Orange had been reluctant to act against James II for fear it would ruin her succession prospects. Yet if England was left to itself the situation could become desperate for the Dutch Republic: Louis XIV might intervene and so make James II his vassal; or James, wishing to distract his subjects, might even join with Louis in a repetition of the attack made on the Dutch Republic in 1672. By the end of 1687, therefore, William had envisaged intervention, and by early 1688 he had secretly begun to make active preparations. The birth of a son to James's second wife in June 1688 displaced William's wife Mary as James's heir apparent. With the French busy creating their <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> in the Palatinate (too busy to consider serious intervention in the Spanish Netherlands or to move against the south-eastern Dutch provinces along the Rhine) the States General unanimously gave William their full support {{in the knowledge that}} the overthrow of James II was in the security interests of their own state.|$|E
500|$|The electoral {{success of}} the Vlaams Blok began after the younger {{generation}} in the party shifted the party's emphasis from Flemish nationalism (separatism) to the immigration issue. In the 1988 local election in Antwerp the party first started to take off, going from 5.5% {{of the vote in}} the city to 17.7%, a success which drew much publicity. On 10 May 1989, based on the Antwerp success, the presidents of all major Belgian parties (including the People's Union) signed a <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> (hygienic barrier), where the parties agreed to never conclude any political agreements with the Vlaams Blok, nor make immigration a political issue. While the Vlaams Blok itself also largely rejected cooperation with other parties, it did increasingly consider such cooperation, particularly in elections in 1994, 1999 and 2000, only to find themselves effectively blocked by the <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire.</b> Although intended to keep the Vlaams Blok from gaining political influence, many argued that the agreement in reality gave room for the strong electoral surge for the party, as it was made into what could be seen as the only [...] "true opposition."

The United States does little to prepare because it is overconfident {{in its ability to}} suppress any threat.

500|$|The <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> {{turned out}} to be {{counterproductive}} with the Centre Democrats winning 77 seats in the 1994 local elections and gaining representation in almost every city where it fielded a candidate. Large cities were strongholds of the party, winning more than 10% of the vote in Rotterdam. It became the fifth largest Dutch political party. After the elections, however, scandal loomed over the Centre Democrats, largely because of its weak organization and lack of active party members. Many of its previously won local seats became vacant after a while, as elected representatives failed to take them up, joined or founded other parties, left the party or left politics altogether. Before the 1994 general election opinion polls predicted that the party could win more than five seats in the House of Representatives. However, media reports claiming that some newly elected local members had extremist pasts damaged the Centre Democrats' prospects. A secret recording broadcast on national television one week before the election showed an Amsterdam council member bragging about having set immigrant centers on fire in the early 1980s. In the election that followed, the Centre Democrats won 2.5% of the vote and three seats in the House of Representatives (Janmaat was joined by Wil Schuurman and Cor Zonneveld), well below earlier expectations. Janmaat claimed that the relatively poor result was a result of an anti-CD campaign in the media. Due to its growth, and questions arising amongst the other parties over the development of a multicultural society, [...] political opponents began to confront the Centre Democrats directly rather than maintain a strict <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> around it.|$|E

The EU sanctions were lifted in September, after a report had found that the measures were effective only in the short term; in the long run, they might give rise to an anti-EU backlash.

It was also at this stage that Romania and the Second Polish Republic inaugurated their military alliance (see Polish-Romanian Alliance). The goal to create a <b>cordon</b> <b>sanitaire</b> against Bolshevist Russia also brought him and his Minister of the Interior Argetoianu to oversee repression measures against the group of Socialist Party of Romania members who voted in favor of joining the Comintern (arrested on suspicion of [...] "attempt against the state's security" [...] on May 12, 1921). This came after a long debate in Parliament over the imprisonment of Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor, a Romanian citizen who had joined the Russian Red Army in Bessarabia during the later stages of the October Revolution, and who had been tried for treason. Argetoianu, who proclaimed communism to be [...] "over in Romania", later indicated that Averescu and other members of the cabinet were hesitant about the crackdown, and that he ultimately resorted to taking initiative for the arrests [...] thus presenting his fellow politicians with a fait accompli.|$|E
