In modern software, typing text usually causes previous text to scroll {{off the top of}} the screen or window. Some old programs could disable this and restart at the top of the window when scroll lock was pressed. The advantage is that the entire screenful of text does not shift, making it easier to read. Scroll Lock was also used to lock the cursor on its line and scroll the work area under it. In spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel, it locks the <b>cell</b> <b>pointer</b> on the current cell, allowing the user to use the arrow keys to move the view window without moving the <b>cell</b> <b>pointer.</b> On some consoles (such as the Linux console), it prevents scrolling of messages until another key combination is pressed. Many hardware KVM switches use Scroll Lock to switch between the devices they control.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Heap-manipulating {{programs}} allow flexible manipulations over dynamically allocated, shared, and mutable heap <b>cells</b> via <b>pointers</b> {{that point}} to not only linked data structures but also their pointer fields. Therefore, memory leak detection for these programs requires precise field-sensitive pointer alias information, which make the problem more challenging. In this paper, we present a field and context sensitive algorithm for detecting memory leaks in heap-manipulating programs. First, we propose a modular heap abstraction based on member-access distances and alias bit-vector domain as the escape model of each procedure; Then, based on procedural summaries characterized by this modular heap abstraction, an efficient context-sensitive memory leak detection is proposed in an on-demand way. Experimental evaluation about a set of large C benchmark programs shows that the proposed approach is scalable with satisfied precision as expected.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} {{the implementation of the}} three-dimensional triangulation package 1 of the Computational Geometric Algorithms Library Cgal 2. We focus on representation issues and especially insist on how the cases of degenerate dimensions are treated. The algorithmic issues are not examined in this short paper. 1 Introduction A three-dimensional triangulation is a three-dimensional simplicial complex, pure connected and without singularities [BY 98]. It is a set of cells (tetrahedra) such that two cells either do not intersect or share a common facet, edge or vertex. Generalizing the storage of 2 D triangulations [tri 99] to the 3 D case, we choose to explicitly represent only cells and vertices, together with adjacency and incidence relations: a <b>cell</b> has <b>pointers</b> to its four vertices and to its four neighbors, a vertex has a pointer to one of the cells having this vertex. Design Overview We follow the design in three layers proposed for polyhedral surfaces by L [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about list structures: {{how they are}} used tn practice, {{how they can be}} moved. and copied efficiently, and howthey can. be {{represented}} by spacesaving encodings. The approach taken to these subjects is mainly empirical. Measurement results are based on five large pl_ograms written in Interlisp, a sophisticated Lisp system that runs on the PDP-l O. Static data were collected at the end of typical runs of the programs, and all list structure used as data by them was measured (about 50, 000 cells each). Strong regularities were discovered. In each program, about one-third of all cars pointed to lists, the rest mainly to literal atoms and small integers; roughly three-fourths of cdrs pointed to lists, the rest mainly to the atom NIL. List pointers generally pointed to a location physically nearby. in memory, a condition that appears to depend only on the sequential allocation of new list <b>cells.</b> Atom <b>pointers</b> were distributed approximately according to Zipf's law, which models word occurrence tn natural]anguage text. Less agreement was found among the programs when dynamic references t...|$|R
50|$|The memory {{organization}} of the SECD machine {{is similar to the}} model used by most functional language interpreters: a number of memory cells, each of which can hold either an atom (a simple value, for example 13), or represent an empty or non-empty list. In the latter case, the <b>cell</b> holds two <b>pointers</b> to other <b>cells,</b> one representing the first element, the other representing the list except for the first element. The two pointers are traditionally named car and cdr respectively—but the more modern terms head and tail are often used instead. The different types of values that a cell can hold are distinguished by a tag. Often different types of atoms (integers, strings, etc.) are distinguished as well.|$|R
40|$|Pelvic and peritoneal {{tuberculosis}} may resemble advanced {{ovarian cancer}} {{due to the}} presence of ascites, complex adnexal masses, peritoneal deposits and raised CA- 125 level, especially in peri- and postmenopausal women. Other common features among women with these two conditions are abdominal pain and distension, weight loss and reduced appetite. As the treatment of pelvic-peritoneal tuberculosis is completely different from that of ovarian cancer, it is important to reach a correct diagnosis. Sometimes women with pelvic-peritoneal tuberculosis may be subjected to a laparotomy for suspected ovarian cancer which is likely to increase their morbidity. In the present article, we report ten women in the peri- and post-menopausal age group where this diagnostic dilemma arose of whom seven were diagnosed only after a laparotomy had been performed for suspected ovarian cancer due to adnexal masses with ascites and raised CA- 125 level. Ascitic fluid showing lymphocytic predominance, raised ADA level and absence of malignant <b>cells</b> are <b>pointers</b> to consider the possibility of pelvic- peritoneal tuberculosis, especially in endemic countries like India. In such situations, an effort should be made to obtain a cytological or histopathological diagnosis of either condition by ultrasound guided needle biopsy or laparoscopically obtained biopsy rather that proceeding with laparotomy for suspected ovarian cancer...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{purpose of}} the project was to design a robot cell {{calibration}} method built on simple laser sensing methods. The main reason for this was {{to make it easier for}} small and medium sized enterprises to use robots when producing in short series. Different working principles for the laser and the sensor were explored and a laser-sensor device similar to a bar-code reader, where the intensity of reflected light is measured, was chosen. The laser beam tracks a coordinate system by calculating the intersection of the different beam paths. A simulation model was built in the Matlab environment Simulink, where a controller program was developed and tested. The controller program was then ported to a robotic program-ming language and successfully run on a real industrial robot. Routines for analysing the measured data were also developed.

50|$|The PDS-1's {{built-in}} minicomputer {{was needed}} for responding to user keyboard and light pen interactions quickly, without delays in talking to a remote timeshared large computer for help. The minicomputer's main task was to build and modify the display list as needed for the next refresh cycle. For text and 2-D line graphics this was easy and did not involve much computing. To minimize costs, Imlac designed their own simple minicomputer with as few registers and logic gates as possible. It was a single-accumulator machine much like a DEC PDP-8, except using 16-bit instructions and data instead of 12 bits. There were no integer multiply/divide instructions, no floating point instructions, no microprogramming, no virtual addressing, and no cache. The single form of address modification was via indirect address pointers held in memory. Certain <b>pointer</b> <b>cells</b> would auto-increment when used. Stack operations were not supported.|$|R
5000|$|Scala enforces a {{distinction}} between immutable (unmodifiable, read-only) variables, whose value cannot be changed once assigned, and mutable variables, which can be changed. A similar distinction is made between immutable and mutable objects. The distinction must be made when a variable is declared: Immutable variables are declared with [...] while mutable variables use [...] Similarly, all of the collection objects (container types) in Scala, e.g. linked lists, arrays, sets and hash tables, are available in mutable and immutable variants, with the immutable variant considered the more basic and default implementation. The immutable variants are [...] "persistent" [...] data types in that they create a new object that encloses the old object and adds the new member(s); {{this is similar to}} how linked lists are built up in Lisp, where elements are prepended by creating a new [...] "cons" [...] <b>cell</b> with a <b>pointer</b> to the new element (the [...] "head") and the old list (the [...] "tail"). This allows for very easy concurrency — no locks are needed as no shared objects are ever modified.Immutable structures are also constructed efficiently, in the sense that modified instances reuses most of old instance data and unused/unreferenced parts are collected by GC.|$|R
40|$|Great {{concern has}} been {{demonstrated}} by different aeronautic operators {{about the effects of}} electromagnetic interference in avionics and electronic equipments of airplanes, due to the use of portable electronic devices (PEDs), which can be easily carried by the passengers. Among the suspect devices, there are laptops and palmtops, audio recorders and reproducers, electronic games and toys, laser <b>pointers,</b> <b>cell</b> phones, communication radios and pagers. Uncouplings or automatic pilot deviations, mistaken indications in displays and, even, the unadverted disconnection of the avionics or variations not commanded in the control surfaces are flaws attributed to these devices. In spite of suffering critics, several regulation agencies in aeronautics, all over the world, have prohibited the use of these portable devices, specially in the critical phases of the flight landing and take off. Nevertheless, its getting bigger the passengers desire of using, uninterruptely, laptops and cell phones, what makes necessary the adoption of safety procedures to satisfy this demand. Besides the concern over these dangerous effects, there are yet, doubts over the topic, and, therefore, its indicated the need of more investigations over these phenomenons. In this work, we relate the main accomplished experiments with the intent to clarify how the PEDs, more specifically the cell phones, cause an undesirable electromagnetic interference...|$|R
40|$|In {{the heap}} {{model in which}} garbage {{collectors}} usually operate, the heap is an array of cells. Each cell contains either a non-pointer, to be ignored, or a pointer to a block of cells somewhere in the heap, called an object. The objects do not overlap. In addition, {{there are a bunch}} of cells not in the heap, called the root set. It is possible to determine from a cell whether it contains a pointer or not, and it is possible to determine from a pointer how long the object pointed to is. The goal of a garbage collector is to preserve all structures that are accessible through a chain of deferences starting at the root set, while reclaiming any storage not thus accessible. Such accessible storage is called live. In copying garbage collection, the best technique for most applications, a new heap is constructed, all live objects are copied to this new heap, and pointers are updated to reflect the new locations [2, 4]. Here we consider the addition of a new kind of value to be permitted in <b>cells,</b> namely <b>pointers</b> to single <b>cells.</b> These single cells may be inside objects that are referenced by the usual pointers to objects. For historical reasons, these <b>pointers</b> to single <b>cells</b> are called locatives. Locatives are similar to Pascal pointers, in that the only operations that can be performed on a locative are to deference it or to alter the contents of the cell it points to. 1 In Pascal, pointers can not be constructed to arbitrary components of structures; but such pointers can be constructed in most other Algol descended languages, such as Modula or ADA. Some lisp systems, such as ZetaLisp [7] and T [6], incorporate locatives into copying garbage collectors by having a special routine that allows a pointer to the surrounding object to be recovered from a locative. This allows locatives to exist at the expense of never reclaiming the storage occupied by an otherwise unreferenced object containing a cell pointed to by a locative. Also, requiring the ability to recover a pointer to the surrounding object from a locative constrains and complicates memory formats, as in garbage collectors for C [3]. In the next section we will develop an algorithm that reclaims the otherwise unreferenced cells of objects containing cells pointed to by locatives, thus alleviating these difficulties...|$|R
