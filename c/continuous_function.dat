5|$|Optical {{properties}} of carbon nanotubes derive from electronic transitions within one-dimensional {{density of states}} (DOS). A typical feature of one-dimensional crystals is that their DOS is not a <b>continuous</b> <b>function</b> of energy, but it descends gradually and then increases in a discontinuous spike. In contrast, three-dimensional materials have continuous DOS. The sharp peaks found in one-dimensional materials are called Van Hove singularities.|$|E
5|$|A {{qualitative}} {{justification for}} this extrapolation of his method {{has been suggested}} by Valluri, Wilson and Harper. According to their argument, Newton considered the apsidal precession angle α (the angle between the vectors of successive minimum and maximum distance from the center) to be a smooth, <b>continuous</b> <b>function</b> of the orbital eccentricity ε. For the inverse-square force, α equals 180°; the vectors to the positions of minimum and maximum distances lie on the same line. If α is initially not 180° at low ε (quasi-circular orbits) then, in general, α will equal 180° only for isolated values of ε; a randomly chosen value of ε would be very unlikely to give α = 180°. Therefore, the observed slow rotation of the apsides of planetary orbits suggest that {{the force of gravity}} is an inverse-square law.|$|E
