50|$|With a {{speed of}} over 20 knots, she {{operated}} during the summer season between the north Jersey Shore and New York City. However, her size and speed made her ill-suited to the route, and she lacked manoeuvrability in the <b>congested</b> <b>waters</b> of New York harbour. With the decline in traffic during the First World War she was laid up during the 1917 and 1918 summer seasons.|$|E
50|$|The job of an {{operations}} specialist can be {{very intense}} and stressful while the ship is underway. Operational tempos go from next to no contacts {{in the middle of}} an ocean to dozens, if not more in <b>congested</b> <b>waters.</b> They need to be able to think quickly, drawing on a large reserve of tactical and procedural knowledge and be able make calculations on the fly in the fast-paced and information-saturated environment of naval combat operations at sea.|$|E
5000|$|A {{maritime}} pilot, {{also known}} as a marine pilot or harbor pilot and sometimes simply called a pilot, is a sailor who manoeuvres ships through dangerous or <b>congested</b> <b>waters,</b> such as harbors or river mouths. He or she is normally an ex ship captain and a highly experienced shiphandler who possesses detailed knowledge of the particular waterway, e.g. actual depth, direction and strength of the wind, current and tide at any time of the day. The pilot is a navigational expert for the port of call.|$|E
40|$|It is {{necessary}} to develop a useful application to use big data like as AIS for safety and efficiency of ship operation. AIS is very useful system to collect targets information, but this information is not effective use yet. The evaluation method of collision risk {{is one of the}} cause disturb. Usually the collision risk of ship is evaluated by the value of the Closest Point of Approach (CPA) which is related to a relative motion. So, it becomes difficult to find out a safety pass in a <b>congested</b> <b>water.</b> Here, Line of Predicted Collision (LOPC) and Obstacle Zone by Target (OZT) for evaluation of collision risk are introduced, these values are related to a true motion and it became visible of dangerous place, so it will make easy to find out a safety pass in a <b>congested</b> <b>water...</b>|$|R
50|$|Rice is {{the main}} aquatic plant grown for human food, but smaller areas of {{watercress}} and water chestnut are also cultivated. In their native environments, aquatic weeds {{are part of a}} balanced ecosystem, and it is mainly introduced species of water plant that become invasive and cause problems by <b>congesting</b> <b>water</b> bodies. The worst culprits, found in both temperate and tropical waterways, are floating plants such as water hyacinth, water lettuce and Salvinia, fully submerged rooting plants such as Hydrilla and water milfoil and rooting plants that reach the surface such as cattail, papyrus, bulrush and reed.|$|R
50|$|Cabotage laws {{apply to}} {{merchant}} ships {{in most countries}} that have a coastline so as to protect the domestic shipping industry from foreign competition, preserve domestically owned shipping infrastructure for national security purposes, and ensure safety in <b>congested</b> territorial <b>waters.</b>|$|R
40|$|Vessel traffic {{services}} (VTS) are {{maritime traffic}} monitoring systems used in port approaches, confined or <b>congested</b> <b>waters.</b> VTS operators (VTSOs) monitor a specific geographical area and support and direct ships that sail through the area, primarily making the navigating officer or pilot of each ship {{aware of the}} current traffic situation, local weather and geographical conditions. We used an interactive mid-fidelity simulation as a knowledge eliciting tool to explore the work situation of VTSOs. During the simulation, VTSOs from a VTS centre in Sweden ran a scenario based on a normal traffic situation in their local fairway. Results indicate that the VTSOs, {{even though they are}} well aware of crucial events in the fairway, at times choose not to inform navigating officers or pilots of these safety aspects apart from when subject to protocol. The present paper put forward elements behind this form of miscommunication and presents results indicating that the major contributing factor is the VTSOs’ anticipation of negative attitudes between working groups participating in the VTS system and the lack of sufficient regulation with regard to the role and responsibilities of VTSOs...|$|E
40|$|Combat {{operations}} in the littoral and amphibious environments present unique challenges to both the warfighters, and the system designers. High-tempo navigation, in shallow / <b>congested</b> <b>waters,</b> and in degraded visual environments, increases the stresses on the individuals and teams before combat related tasks are considered. All combat tasks require the crew, and the crafts systems, to have the appropriate level of situation awareness and decision making capability. This Joint Cognitive System (JCS) supports the interoperability needed to achieve successful operational outcomes, particularly in joint operations. Resilience, is essential in the high-tempo coastal environment. Littoral / amphibious craft, being typically small and fast, and by necessity lean manned must be efficient and optimised. Understanding the crew's roles, tasks and competences provides the definitions required for the information architectures and flow, both intra and inter vessel, that supports the JCS and defines the vessel's Combat System. The JCS, and therefore the Combat System, can be scaled with the vessels size, {{as a number of}} the crews / systems functions remain the same. Designing the combat JCS from a human-centred perspective, provides an essential foundation for designing the vessel and delivering the required littoral / amphibious capabilit...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{industrial}} wastewater significantly contaminates our environment. There are many technologies for cleaning these waters. When we are constructing a new treatment plant {{we must take}} into consideration the existing standards and laws of the Republic of Slovenia. The company where I did my research is specialised in foundry industry and it is the manufacturer of the components for automotive and motorcycle industry. Wastewaters in the foundry are cleaned with ultrafiltration treatment plant. But there is a problem caused by excessively high concentrations of iron in the permeate. In my graduation thesis I first described and schematically showed the foundry and the treatment plant. In the selected sources and reference materials I looked for all the available technologies for removing iron from wastewater. I described all the technologies of the process and their advantages and disadvantages. During cleaning iron must precipitate from the soluble divalent to the insoluble trivalent form by oxidation, then the iron or iron oxide is removed with different filters. In experimental work I found the source of the iron in the foundry. In the laboratory I measured pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, concentration of iron and total organic carbon – TOC. With most <b>congested</b> <b>waters</b> I've done one filtration cycle at the membrane treatment plant with water containing the highest concentration of iron. I monitored the effect of cleaning. Finally, I chose the most appropriate technology for cleaning based on the pre-selected criteria...|$|E
50|$|The {{biggest change}} in subject matter was politics, {{sometimes}} explicitly and at others hidden deep in allegory and allusion, {{especially in the}} 1680s. This accounted for {{the largest number of}} catches circulated anonymously in MS (to avoid arrest) though some were openly party propaganda. New habits were also covered; smoking (Aldrich) and <b>congested</b> <b>water</b> travel (Isaak), though conviviality (wine, women and song) accounted for an even greater share than before. Purcell was probably the most prolific contributor with 53 catches to his name including two that are bawdy and many more wrongly attributed to him, most of which are bawdy. Even so, much of that perception {{is in the eye of}} the beholder who forgets that habits and language were different 200 years ago.|$|R

40|$|With {{increasing}} rate {{of shipping}} traffic, {{the risk of}} collisions in busy and <b>congested</b> port <b>waters</b> is expected to rise. However, due to low collision frequencies {{it is difficult to}} analyze such risk in a sound statistical manner. This study aims at examining the occurrence of traffic conflicts {{in order to understand the}} characteristics of vessels involved in navigational hazards. A binomial logit model was employed to evaluate the association of vessel attributes and the kinematic conditions with conflict severity levels. Results show a positive association for vessels of small gross tonnage, overall vessel length, vessel height and draft with conflict risk. Conflicts involving a pair of dynamic vessels sailing at low speeds also have similar effects...|$|R
40|$|Hydrodynamic {{interaction}} effects are critical in <b>congested</b> and confined <b>waters.</b> Increase in speed {{and size of}} modern ships makes their consideration {{in the design of}} ports, docking stations, navigation channels, an indispensable safety parameter. A brief description of various types of interactions and possible consequences is followed by the main focus of this work, namely moving to stationary ship interaction. A mathematical model amenable to quick computation, including moored ship dynamics is presented. Two cases involving accidents due to such {{interaction effects}} are presented along with the author’s conclusions from active participation in them...|$|R
2500|$|On 31 December 2014, Fort Worth was {{dispatched}} from Singapore to the Java Sea to {{take part}} in the search for Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 that crashed on 28 December. On 3 January 2015 she arrived in the area to commence search efforts alongside the destroyer [...] at the request of the Indonesian government. The maneuverability and shallow draft of the design allowed her to conduct expeditious visual and radar searches in the <b>congested,</b> shallow <b>water</b> environment. Both ships concluded search efforts on 15 January 2015 after performing 650 combined search hours. Fort Worth provided unique capabilities over the larger Sampson, and employed her two [...] RHIBs in 107 hours of operations. A team from Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit One was embarked on the ship, operating three Tow Fish side scan sonar systems to search for wreckage during 78 hours over , the AN/PQS-2A passive sonar to listen for black box pings during 17 hours over , and a remotely operated vehicle to investigate objects.|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} rate {{of shipping}} traffic, {{the risk of}} collisions in busy and <b>congested</b> port <b>waters</b> is likely to rise. However, due to low collision frequencies in port waters, {{it is difficult to}} analyze such risk in a sound statistical manner. A convenient approach of investigating navigational collision risk is the application of the traffic conflict techniques, which have potential to overcome the difficulty of obtaining statistical soundness. This study aims at examining port water conflicts {{in order to understand the}} characteristics of collision risk with regard to vessels involved, conflict locations, traffic and kinematic conditions. A hierarchical binomial logit model, which considers the potential correlations between observation-units, i. e., vessels, involved in the same conflicts, is employed to evaluate the association of explanatory variables with conflict severity levels. Results show higher likelihood of serious conflicts for vessels of small gross tonnage or small overall length. The probability of serious conflict also increases at locations where vessels have more varied headings, such as traffic intersections and anchorages; becoming more critical at night time. Findings from this research should assist both navigators operating in port waters as well as port authorities overseeing navigational management...|$|R
50|$|Gull Lake is a {{lake in the}} U.S. {{state of}} Michigan, located mostly in Kalamazoo County with the {{northern}} tip extending into Barry County. The nearest major cities are Kalamazoo, 11 mi to the southwest, and Battle Creek, 13 mi to the southeast. The name was probably derived from the seagulls which at times come inland from Lake Michigan in large numbers. The total surface area of this lake is 2030 acre, with maximum depths of 110 ft. This deep, clear lake has numerous holes in excess of 75 ft, and has one large island in the south end. The shoreline of the lake is fully developed, and is ringed with homes and cottages. A notable sport fishery exists in the lake for Rainbow trout, Lake trout, Land-locked salmon, Smelt, Smallmouth bass, and Yellow perch. Many other species of fish such as bluegill, Largemouth bass, Smallmouth bass, and Northern Pike are home to this lake. Given the proximity of this lake to large centers of population, coupled with the extensive number of riparian property owners, with one public access, the lake is extensively used by boaters during the warm summer months, and can become quite <b>congested</b> with <b>water</b> traffic.|$|R
40|$|Small {{and medium}} scale {{industries}} in Nigeria {{play a major}} role in polluting water bodies, and key among these pollutants are suspended solids, biological oxygen demand and heavy metals contamination. Conventional methods of treatment, such as chemical precipitation, do not provide sustainable solutions as the pollutants are merely transferred from the waste water to a sludge residue which is disposed of by land-filling. The pollutants eventually find their way to freshwater supplies thereby contaminating it. Water hyacinth is a noxious weed that has a rapid growth rate and easily <b>congests</b> the <b>water</b> ways in Lagos, a coastal city in Nigeria, thereby creating serious problems in navigation, and irrigation. This can be harvested, and in line with the golden rules of sustainable development, used for the sustainable treatment of some industrial wastewaters. This work investigates the effectiveness of water hyacinth in wastewater treatment. After a 5 -week simple experiment, in which water hyacinths were planted in wastewater samples obtained from three different industries, the average removal of pollutants were found to be 53. 03 %, 64. 41 %, 65. 4 %, 47. 22 %, 94. 67 % and 30. 30 % fo...|$|R
