40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} at the Comigo Technology Center, in Rio Verde, State of Goiás, Brazil, {{with the objective of}} evaluating the effects of supplementation with <b>calcium</b> <b>butyrate,</b> as a growth promoting agent for the duodenal mucosa and Bacillus subtilis as a probiotic performance enhancer in feedlot cattle. <b>Calcium</b> <b>butyrate</b> (5 and 10 g per animal per day) and Bacillus (10 g per animal per day) were added to a basal diet. There were used 85 Nelore bulls, with average weight of 315 ± 7 kg. The experiment lasted 118 days, including the adaptation period, until slaughter at 30 months of age. Diets were distributed in a completely randomized design with four treatments, where: T 1 = control (basal diet); T 2 = basal diet + 5 g calcium butyrate; T 3 = basal diet + 10 g <b>calcium</b> <b>butyrate</b> and T 4 = basal diet + 10 g <b>calcium</b> <b>butyrate</b> + 10 g probiotic with four replications and five to six animals per replication. It was used a forage: concentrate ratio of 30 : 70, the roughage used was the corn silage. Height and width measurements of intestinal villi were taken, and carcass and meat quality were evaluated. The supplementation of <b>calcium</b> <b>butyrate</b> and Bacillus subtilis positively influenced (p < 0. 05) the carcass marbling level and <b>calcium</b> <b>butyrate</b> increased the villus height in the small intestine. ...|$|E
40|$|Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg {{is a human}} {{pathogen}} also found in broilers. A strain (UFPR 1) {{has been associated with}} field reports of resistance to short-chain organic acids (SCOA) in broilers in the South of Brazil, but was susceptible to a Bacillus subtilis-based probiotic added in feed in a related study. This work aimed to (i) report clinical symptoms caused by SH UFPR 1 in broilers, (ii) study its susceptibility to some antibiotics in vitro, and (iii) SCOA in vivo; and (iv) relate these phenotypic observations with its genome characteristics. Two in vivo trials used 1 -day-old chicks housed for 21 [*]days in 8 sterilized isolated negative pressure rooms with 4 battery cages of 12 birds each. Birds were challenged or not with 107 [*]CFU/bird of SH UFPR 1 orally and exposed or not to SCOA in a 2 [*]×[*] 2 factorial design. Zootechnical parameters were unaffected (P[*]>[*] 0. 05), no clinical signs were observed, and few cecal and hepatic histologic and immune-related alterations were seen, in birds challenged with SH. Formic and propionic acids added together in drinking water, fumaric and benzoic acid in feed (Trial 1), and coated <b>calcium</b> <b>butyrate</b> in feed (Trial 2) did not reduce the SH isolation frequencies seen in cecum and liver in broilers after SH challenge (P[*]>[*] 0. 05). SH UFPR 1 was susceptible to amikacin, amoxicillin[*]+[*]clavulanate, ceftiofur, cephalexin, doxycycline and oxytetracycline; and mildly susceptible to ampicillin[*]+[*]sulbactam, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and gentamycin in an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration model using Mueller–Hinton agar. The whole genome of SH UFPR 1 was sequenced and consisted of a circular chromosome, spanning 4, 760, 321 [*]bp with 52. 18 % of GC-content encoding 84 tRNA, 22 rRNA, and 4, 427 protein-coding genes. The comparison between SH UFPR 1 genome and a multidrug-resistant SL 476 strain revealed 11 missing genomic fragments and 5 insertions related to bgt, bgr, and rpoS genes. The deleted genes codify proteins associated with cell cycle regulation, virulence, drug resistance, cellular adhesion, and salt efflux which collectively reveal key aspects of the evolution and adaptation of SH strains such as organic acids resistance and antibiotic sensitivity and provide information relevant to the control of SH in poultry...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 92 - 94). Lee (1993) has shown that tertiary amines are able to hics. extract water from low-concentration calcium acetate and sodium acetate solutions. This thesis extends the previous work to include <b>calcium</b> propionate and <b>butyrate.</b> Amine extraction may be used to selectively remove water from a fermentation broth thus concentrating calcium acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Compared to competing technologies that extract undissociated acids from a volatile fatty acid fermentation broth, extracting water with tertiary amines allows for higher pH levels in the broth resulting in greater productivity. Specifically, triethylamine and N,N-diethyl-methylamine in a 1 : 2 volumetric mixture are superior to any other examined mixture or single amine for extracting water at 40 []C, the proposed fermentation temperature (Lee, 1993; Davison et al., 1966, 1967). Once the acid salts have been concentrated, a variety of techniques are available to convert the concentrated salts into other products such as ketones, alcohols, and acids. At low temperatures, the low-molecular-weight amine mixture has a high affinity for water. By raising the temperature 20 to 25 []C, the water separates from the amine allowing for convenient solvent regeneration of the amine. The distribution coefficients, [], measure the selectivity of concentrating calcium salts in the aqueous phase. The distribution coefficients generally vary as follows: [] thus, there is less selectivity as the aliphatic group increases in size. The amine mixture was used to extract water from actual fermentation broth to determine whether possible surfactants in the broth interfere with the extraction. Prior to extraction, the fermentation broth was adjusted to pH 11. 5 by adding a small amount of lime. The high pH precipitate protein which can be recycled to the fermentor or collected for animal feed. Through 15 extraction runs, no degradation of the amine was observed...|$|R
40|$|As the key {{components}} of innate immunity, human host defense antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs) {{play a critical role}} in warding off invading microbial pathogens. In addition, AMPs can possess other biological functions such as apoptosis, wound healing, and immune modulation. This article provides an overview on the identification, activity, 3 D structure, and mechanism of action of human AMPs selected from the antimicrobial peptide database. Over 100 such peptides have been identified from a variety of tissues and epithelial surfaces, including skin, eyes, ears, mouths, gut, immune, nervous and urinary systems. These peptides vary from 10 to 150 amino acids with a net charge between − 3 and + 20 and a hydrophobic content below 60 %. The sequence diversity enables human AMPs to adopt various 3 D structures and to attack pathogens by different mechanisms. While α-defensin HD- 6 can self-assemble on the bacterial surface into nanonets to entangle bacteria, both HNP- 1 and β-defensin hBD- 3 are able to block cell wall biosynthesis by binding to lipid II. Lysozyme is well-characterized to cleave bacterial cell wall polysaccharides but can also kill bacteria by a non-catalytic mechanism. The two hydrophobic domains in the long amphipathic α-helix of human cathelicidin LL- 37 lays the basis for binding and disrupting the curved anionic bacterial membrane surfaces by forming pores or via the carpet model. Furthermore, dermcidin may serve as ion channel by forming a long helix-bundle structure. In addition, the C-type lectin RegIIIα can initially recognize bacterial peptidoglycans followed by pore formation in the membrane. Finally, histatin 5 and GAPDH(2 - 32) can enter microbial cells to exert their effects. It appears that granulysin enters cells and kills intracellular pathogens with the aid of pore-forming perforin. This arsenal of human defense proteins not only keeps us healthy but also inspires the development of a new generation of personalized medicine to combat drug-resistant superbugs, fungi, viruses, parasites, or cancer. Alternatively, multiple factors (e. g., albumin, arginine, <b>butyrate,</b> <b>calcium,</b> cyclic AMP, isoleucine, short-chain fatty acids, UV B light, vitamin D, and zinc) are able to induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides, opening new avenues to the development of anti-infectious drugs...|$|R
