They were compared in the French Alps at the Lac Blanc Pass, where a bench test for the aeolian transport of snow was set up. The two existing generations of FlowCapt are compared. Both seem to be good detectors for the aeolian transport of snow, especially for transport events with a flux above 1 g m 22 s 21.

The aeolian snow mass fluxes and snow quantity transported recorded by the second-generation FlowCapt {{are close to the}} integrative snow particle <b>counter</b> <b>S</b> 7 fluxes for an event without precipitation, but they are underestimated when an event with precipitation is considered. When the winter season is considered, for integrative snow particle <b>counter</b> <b>S</b> 7 fluxes above 20 g m 22 s 21, the second-generation FlowCapt fluxes are underestimated, regardless of precipitation. In conclusion, both generations of FlowCapt {{can be used as a}} drifting snow detector and the second generation can record an underestimation of the quantity of snow transported at one location: over the winter season, the quantity of snow transported recorded by the SPC is between 4 and 6 times greater than the quantity recorded by the second-generation FlowCapt...|$|E

40|$|An {{innovative}} X-ray {{imaging sensor}} with intrinsic digital characteristics is presented. It {{is based on}} Chromatic Photon Counting technology. The detector is able to count individually the incident X-ray photons and to separate them according to their energy (two 'color' images per exposure). The energy selection occurs in real time and at radiographic imaging speed (GHz global counting rate). Photon counting, color mode and a very high spatial resolution (more than 10 l. p. /mm at MTF 50) allow to obtain an optimal ratio between image quality and absorbed dose. The individual block of the imaging system is a two-side buttable semiconductor radiation detector made of a thin pixellated CdTe crystal (the sensor) coupled to a large area VLSI CMOS pixel ASIC. 1, 2, 4, 8 tile units have been built.

Patients with reactive thrombocytosis had considerably lower mean platelet volumes than those with myeloproliferative thrombocytosis, or normal subjects. The opposite was true for the platelet distribution width. This index for platelet heterogeneity was normal in reactive, but increased in myeloproliferative thrombocytosis. There were no differences in mean platelet volume or platelet distribution width between patients with myeloproliferative disease and a high or normal platelet count. The increased platelet heterogeneity in myeloproliferative disease was caused by an increase of both small and large platelets.
