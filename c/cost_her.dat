Her {{marriage}} prospects immediately dried up.

The Chinese minister in St. Petersburg was asked by the Empress Anna who was the most beautiful woman at her court, leading him to point to Elizabeth, much to Anna's intense displeasure. There was little love lost between the cousins and no prospect of either any Russian nobleman or any foreign prince seeking Elizabeth's hand in marriage.

25|$|Melissa Bean, of Barrington was the {{incumbent}} {{representative of the}} 8th district, having displaced Phil Crane in the 2004 election. Bean {{is considered to be}} one of the more conservative Democrats currently serving in the House, having voted the Democratic Party line only 79.5% during the first 18 months of her term. Only 26 Democratic Representatives, out of 201 serving during her first term, had more conservative voting records. Bean identifies as a Blue Dog Democrat, meaning she tends to be slightly more socially conservative, and much more fiscally conservative, than other Democrats in the House. Indeed, Bean was one of the few Democratic supporters of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, a move which <b>cost</b> <b>her</b> the endorsement of the AFL-CIO. She also voted to extend a package of tax cuts passed by the Republican-controlled congress, a dramatic break from the Democratic Party's official position on the cuts. However, her fiscally conservative voting record earned Bean the endorsement of the United States Chamber of Commerce. The organization, composed mainly of small businesses, rarely endorses Democrats, feeling that the positions advocated by the Party are harmful to businesses.|$|E
