5000|$|The rails {{were very}} similar to today's {{flat-bottomed}} stock, which {{has become known as}} Vignoles rail, and weighed [...] The line was unusual for the day in not using any stone blocks.

50|$|The {{engineer}} Richard B Grantham considered {{various forms}} of permanent way and he recommended 100 lb per yard Barlow rail with <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers</b> at the joints, {{at a cost of}} £1,960 per mile. This system had proved fairly satisfactory on other lightly used lines, although gauge retention problems were beginning to be apparent.|$|R
5000|$|The {{track was}} laid to {{standard}} [...] gauge, although during the construction the directors were undecided and ordered extra-long 9 ft sleepers {{with a view}} to conversion to [...] broad gauge, which never happened. The line used [...] "Vignoles" [...] flat bottomed rail, broader in the base and lower than modern rail. These were mounted on longitudinal timbers with <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{passing over}} Arden Moss, for {{a length of}} 1½ miles, the rails are entirely laid on {{longitudinal}} timbers of red pine, having a scantling of 10 inches by 4 inches. These timbers rest on <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers</b> of beech, larch, or Scotch fir, which are 9 feet in length, and have {{a cross section of}} 12 inches by 6 inches, being placed at intervals of 3 feet." ...|$|R
5000|$|The rails {{consisted}} of flat bottomed ('web footed') rail secured by 7" [...] oak keys. The longitudinal track {{consisted of}} Baltic half timber bearers connected by <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers.</b> Rails 2¾" [...] deep of 55 lb per yd rail were {{used on the}} longitudinal track embedded in saddles 12" [...] long which were secured to the sleepers. The cross-sleepered track used rails 3¾" [...] deep weighing 63 lb per yd, fixed in 12" [...] by 5" [...] chairs.|$|R
25|$|Early {{railways}} (c.1840s) {{experimented with}} continuous bearing railtrack, {{in which the}} rail was supported along its length, with examples including Brunel's baulk road on the Great Western Railway, as well as use on the Newcastle and North Shields Railway, on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to a design by John Hawkshaw, and elsewhere. Continuous-bearing designs were also promoted by other engineers. The system was trialled on the Baltimore and Ohio railway in the 1840s, but {{was found to be}} more expensive to maintain than rail with <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 30 June 1854 Captain Tyler of the Board of Trade {{made his}} {{inspection}} of the Crediton to Barnstaple section; it was not proposed to open the Barnstaple to Fremington line until the continuation to Bideford was ready. (In fact the powers for this had not been renewed, and they lapsed.) He made some comments regarding signal positions and observed that the track was broad gauge on <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers</b> [...] "with double I rails": flat bottom rails. It was single line broad gauge throughout, with the electric telegraph installed throughout the line.|$|R

50|$|The steepest {{gradient}} was 1 in 330, {{with the largest}} earthworks being on the Rugby line at the Leire cutting and embankment. There were 148 bridges in all, and three tunnels. The rails were double headed in 15 foot lengths at 77 lb. per yard at a gauge throughout of 4 foot 8½ inches. These were laid either on gritstone blocks from Cromford, laid diagonally, or on embankments, timber sleepers of oak or kyanised larch. For a length near Rugby, Evans's dove-tailed bridge rails of 57 lb per yard, were tried, mounted on longitudinal Memel fir timbers with pine <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Originally {{the line}} had single {{parallel}} tracks of Stephenson gauge , fixed to stone blocks or sleepers. By 1840 {{there was a}} mixture of bridge rails, single parallel and double parallel rails (See Rail profile). The original rails caused excessive noise, and damage to structure and rolling stock. Bridge rails were used on the viaduct between Deptford and Greenwich initially, laid on longitudinal timbers with <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers</b> at four-foot intervals. At this time, new double parallel rails of 78lb. to the yard were laid for a quarter of mile (400m) at Deptford on timber sleepers, presumably as an experiment. The concrete underlay was replaced with gravel ballast of [...] thickness.|$|R
5000|$|The first 7 mi of {{the line}} from Malton {{included}} severe gradients, ascending, including [...] at 1 in 70, and required heavy civil engineering works. The highest point {{of the line}} was within the tunnel, where the southbound gradient changed from 1 in 70 up to 1 in 85 down. As built the line included a number of timber bridges, and a timber viaduct at Wharram. Land had been acquired for a double track line but only a single track was laid, using [...] weight rails, on <b>cross</b> <b>sleepered</b> track. The line was to be worked by the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway, under the same rules as the Thirsk and Malton Line.|$|R
50|$|Finally in 1871 the GWR {{took the}} {{decision}} to convert the gauge of all its broad gauge track from Swindon through Gloucester to west Wales, including all branches; some mixed gauge sections were converted to narrow-only in addition. The work was executed in April 1872 in a massive operation. On the night of Tuesday 30 April the up line from New Milford and Grange Court was closed, and single line working of a reduced train service instituted on the down line. Considerable technical preparation had been made including oiling and freeing of the bolts; much of the track was the GWR pattern longitudinal timber track, but some Barlow rail sections had been replaced with rails on <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers,</b> {{and because of the}} use of fang bolts this was much more laborious to convert.|$|R
50|$|The {{inconvenience}} of {{the break}} of gauge between broad gauge and narrow gauge lines {{was becoming more}} marked over time, and at length in 1871 the decision {{was taken by the}} Great Western Railway to convert the gauge of all the broad gauge track in Wales.

40|$|Rail {{corrugation}} in cornering {{is examined}} via a non-linear time-domain {{model of a}} bogie cornering. The model is computationally fast due to a modal description of a wheelset that includes bending and twisting modes of its axle as well as flexing of wheel hubs. The modal wheelset model is tuned to match finite element predictions of its natural frequencies. The rails are also modelled using modal parameters found by fitting field measured receptance data. The model predicts corrugation over a range of wavelengths from one wavelength per sleeper to shorter wavelengths below 100 mm. It is found that a range of wavelengths around 100 mm, can be excited on a curve of 300 m radius, in addition to longer wavelengths associated more with track or primary suspension dynamics. The mix of frequencies present changes as corrugation grows, the wavelengths around 100 mm dominating at later times. Stick-slip between wheel and rail is evident, especially on the leading axle, and contributes to both long and shorter wavelength corrugation. The shorter wavelengths relate to a peak lateral response of the track, and a minimum vertical response. The sliding oscillation causing wear is mainly a stick-slip oscillation of lateral creep. Parametric excitation from <b>crossing</b> <b>sleepers</b> is represented by changing the track parameters. It is shown that <b>sleeper</b> <b>crossing</b> excitation can have an important influence {{on the extent of}} stick-slip oscillation, especially with stiff railpads on concrete sleepers, and a coefficient of friction that decreases with increased sliding...|$|R

5|$|Soon {{after the}} railway opened, {{complaints}} about vibrations from passing trains {{began to be}} made by occupiers of buildings along the route. The vibrations were caused by the heavy, largely unsprung locomotives which weighed 44tons (44.7tonnes). The Board of Trade set up a committee to investigate the problem, and the CLR experimented with two solutions. For the first solution, three locomotives were modified to use lighter motors and were provided with improved suspension, so the weight was reduced to 31tons (31.5tonnes), more of which was sprung to reduce vibrations; for the second solution, two six-carriage trains were formed that had the two end carriages converted and provided with driver's cabs and their own motors so they could run as multiple units without a separate locomotive. The lighter locomotives did reduce the vibrations felt at the surface, but the multiple units removed it almost completely and the CLR chose to adopt that solution. The committee's report, published in 1902, also found that the CLR's choice of 100lb/yard (49.60kg/m) bridge rail for its tracks rather than a stiffer bullhead rail on <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers</b> contributed to the vibration.|$|R

5000|$|The tunnel {{was built}} in a shallow trench of 4 ft in depth; the {{contemporary}} illustration (right) showing the line disappearing beneath the landscape {{seems to be no}} more than artistic licence although, as built, earth may have been drawn up around the structure. In the tunnel the bridge-profile rails were on longitudinal sleepers whereas in the platform sections conventional [...] <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers</b> were used. Rammell included a curve of 8 chain m radius and a gradient of 1 in 15 (7 per cent) to demonstrate the capabilities of his design. The power was provided by a large fan, some 22 ft in diameter, like a paddle-wheel in an iron case (see image) that was powered at 300rpm by a former steam locomotive, mounted on a plinth, acting through leather belts. [...] The carriage at the upper terminus was allowed to enter the tunnel under its own weight, when [...] "a pair of iron doors, hinged like lock gates" [...] was closed behind it. Air at a pressure of [...] "2&frac12; ounces per square inch" [...] was then admitted through a grating, propelling the vehicle to the other terminus. As the vehicle approached the lower terminus it was slowed by a short, uphill section of track and the release of the propelling air pressure as it passed a grating open to the atmosphere; the only intervention required from the operator was the application of the brake.|$|R
5000|$|The {{manufacture}} of the rails themselves was gradually improved. By making them in longer lengths, a reduction was effected {{in the number}} of joints, always the weakest part of the line; and another advance consisted in the substitution of wrought iron for cast iron, though that material did not gain wide adoption until after the patent for an improved method of rolling rails granted in 1820 to John Birkinshaw, of the Bedlington Ironworks, Northumberland. His rails were wedge-shaped in section, much wider at the top than at the bottom, with the intermediate portion or web thinner still, and he recommended that they should be made 18 ft long, even suggesting that several of them might be welded together end to end to form considerable lengths. They were supported on sleepers by chairs at intervals of 3 ft, and were fish-bellied between the points of support. As used by George Stephenson on the Stockton & Darlington and Canterbury & Whitstable lines, they weighed [...] On the Liverpool and Manchester Railway they were usually 12 or 15 ft long and weighed , and they were fastened by iron wedges to chairs weighing 15 or 17 lb each. The chairs were in turn fixed to the sleepers by two iron spikes, half-round wooden <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers</b> being employed on embankments and stone blocks 20 in square by 10 in deep in cuttings.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{concepts of}} railway track analysis, such Beam on Elastic Foundation (BOEF), Winkler 2 ̆ 7 s theory or Zimmermann method are categorized as one-dimensional {{analysis of a}} railway structure and are simplification of a beam laid on a continuous support (soil 2 ̆ 7 s subgrade or foundation). These methods are still very useful for analyzing a simple design and analysis of railway track systems. Unfortunately, for doing a complex analysis of a railway track, these methods have lack of capabilities, since they only take into account one-dimensional system and neglect the actual discrete support provided by <b>crossed</b> <b>sleeper,</b> ballast, sub ballast mat and subgrade. Nowadays, the use of computer software for doing Finite Element Method (FEM) or Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of a structure is very common for engineers. FEA consists of {{a huge amount of}} complex calculations; therefore, a manual calculation by hand is almost impossible to be done. Hence, the use of computer software will be very useful in this manner. The applications of FEM using software also widen in the field of railway infrastructure design and analysis. There are many advantages of using FEM method using computer. However, related to its complexities, one should understands the concepts and “knows-how” to solve the problems, to idealize the structure into FEM model in computer, and to choose the suitable elements and its behaviours, and also the correct method. Thispaper is presented to discuss the basic theories behind the conventional and advanced ways of modelling of railway track system, to show the basic concepts of modelling railway track systems using FEM, to present two- and three-dimensional FEM models of railway superstructures which are built using software ANSYS, and to demonstrate the way of doing the verification of the results using Zimmermann method...|$|R
50|$|Given that {{it served}} a rural area, St Fagans {{was a fairly}} {{substantial}} station, with two long platforms and large station buildings constructed in stone. The station was the nearest to the Wenvoe Iron Mine, which was active from 1859 to 1864 and generated significant freight traffic at St Fagans. A signal box was built in 1889. Initially, the station had no footbridge, and passengers had to cross via a ground-level <b>crossing</b> made from <b>sleepers.</b> A metal footbridge was eventually added in 1931.|$|R

5000|$|In July 1873 Pettigrew joined Sim {{to inspect}} {{progress}} and try out the [...] "Mary Ann" [...] on the tramway. The rails were sawn at Maryborough, and taken by steamer to the tramway. The [...] "Mary Ann" [...] itself {{was used to}} saw the Cypress pine sleepers for the tramway as the line progressed. Pettigrew explained the process {{in his letter to}} the Governor dated 5 August 1873:It is now at work preparing its line from Thannae to Tin Can Bay. On side of framing is seen a pulley. This is for driving a circular saw bench for cutting up the sleepers. The bench is mounted on two trucks, and is taken along the line as required...The country is barren sandy ground, and the line...is over pretty even ground, requiring no cutting or banking {{at least as far as}} yet made. Steepest gradient is about 1 in 18. Gauge 3 ft 3 in; rails are off spotted gum 4" [...] x 3" [...] but are found to be rather light for weight of engine which is about 6 tons. They are now being made of 4 ?" [...] x 3". The <b>cross</b> <b>sleepers</b> are of Cypress pine 7" [...] x 4 ?" [...] and are notched to receive the rails, and are fastened together by wedges....The ends of the rails require to be bolted or pegged to sleepers but has not yet been done. We estimate that the engine will be able to bring 400 cubic feet of Dundathu pine logs at a trip and at a speed of from 6 to 8 miles per house. The two miles already laid has cost about £200 per mile.The line was opened on 29 October 1873 after 3? miles (5.63 km) had been laid. An official opening and celebratory picnic hosted by the Sim family was held on 30 October with a number of Maryborough's leading citizens attending. Guests travelled up and down the line and were given a parbuckling demonstration (the lifting of timber onto the train). Pettigrew could not attend, but Sim told the gathering that [...] "Mr Pettigrew was at one with him in all these works".Pettigrew's tramway was Queensland's first major private railway. According to Kerr [...] "the early adoption of tramways for hauling logs, and its influence on the development on the railways system in Queensland, centres on one man, William Pettigrew". The success of the Cooloola Tramway in drawing logs from inaccessible places and over difficult terrain encouraged other sawmillers to build light tramways. For example, in the mid-1870s McGhie, Luya and Co. constructed a tramway system across their property on Lake Cootharaba to their sawmill at Mill Point to overcome swampy, low-lying and poorly drained ground conditions. Pettigrew's influence on railways spread beyond the Cooloola area. In 1874 and 1879, he provided advice on the construction and use of tramways. He used his own tramway to demonstrate that a railway could be built for less than £1000 per mile; only a fraction of the cost of government railways, and critics began to condemn government extravagance. The fact that Pettigrew's and other private tramways were never designed to perform the haulage tasks required of government railways was not mentioned by the critics, however the cheap construction of the former did force a reduction in Government standards.|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{concrete}} {{is gaining}} increased popularity {{as a new}} construction material due to its high compressive, tensile and flexural strengths, short curing time, impact resistance, chemical resistance and freeze-thaw durability. It {{can be used to}} repair concrete structures, build slabs and beams of small <b>cross</b> sections and <b>sleepers.</b> There is a great potential of using this material in other structural applications as well. Research work in polymer concrete originated from well over couple of decades. In all of these research programs, either polymer concrete or mortar was made using different types and percentages of resin combined with sand, fly ash and coarse aggregate. The samples thus made were tested for the compressive strength, stress-strain relationships, tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and flexural strength. However, there is no common agreement among the research community about the effect of fly ash on these mechanical properties of polymer concrete. Therefore, this paper investigates the available literature and the experimental results from authors' experimental programs in order to generalize the effect of fly ash on the mechanical properties of polymer concrete. The addition of fly ash as filler material, results in a reduction in the amount of resin, and an increment in the compressive strengths and an increase in the modulus of elasticity. Split tensile strength and flexural strength exhibits a decreasing trend with the increasing fly ash content. ...|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{concrete}} {{is reported}} to have better mechanical properties than its counterpart, Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete. It is gaining increased popularity as a new construction material due to its high compressive, tensile and flexural strengths, short curing time, impact resistance, chemical resistance and freeze-thaw durability. It can be used to repair concrete structures, build slabs and beams of small <b>cross</b> sections and <b>sleepers.</b> A research program has been initiated to improve fundamental understanding of this material and to provide the knowledge required for its broad utilization. In this experimental program, two types of resins (vinylester and epoxy resin) combined with fly ash and sand were used to make polymer concrete mortar. The weight percentages used in the mix designs were selected after analyzing volumetric properties of sand. This paper presents and discusses the results from an investigation of uniaxial compressive stress-strain relationship of polymer based concrete. The effect of resin (binder), and fly ash contents on the compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of vinylester and epoxy resin based polymer filler is reported. It has been found that epoxy resin based polymer concrete and vinylester based polymer concrete can achieve compressive strengths of 75 MPa and 113 MPa respectively. Vinylester polymer concrete showed 4 % ultimate strain, while that for epoxy polymer concrete was 8 %. Tensile strengths were as high as 15 MPa for both types of polymer concrete. The results show that the polymer based filler materials are suitable for both compression and tensile loading situations. ...|$|R
