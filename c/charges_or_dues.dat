Hence, when the circuit is switched on, if Q1 is on, its collector is at 0 V. As a result, Q2 gets switched off.

Similarly, Q2 remains on continuously, if it happens to get switched on first.|$|R
25|$|The Romanesque House is an {{impressive}} piece of evidence of a former grange of Pforta Monastery that was constructed to ensure economic independence. They were run by bearded lay brothers (conversi). The foundation of those granges was made possible because many rulers assigned possessions in return for burial rights for family members on the monastery grounds. The Cistercians successfully sold agricultural and craft products on the markets in Halle, Naumburg, Jena and Erfurt. With even greater success, they managed to enlist parts of the peasant population into their service, offering the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage. As {{a result of its}} aggressive economic policy of establishing granges, Pforta acquired a charter in 1215 to transport carts and loads through the margraviates of Meissen and Lower Lusatia – and thus to Silesia – without being <b>charged</b> taxes <b>or</b> <b>dues.</b>|$|R

40|$|Due to {{intermittent}} {{characteristics of}} wind power generation, battery {{energy storage system}} (BESS) has been exploited for decreasing the adverse impact of wind power output on the grid. This paper focuses on the BESS operation strategy called reference compensation for dispatchable wind. By adaptively compensating a reference signal that is typically set to be an average forecasted wind power for certain duration, the BESS maintains its SOC within a proper range, avoiding the non-compliant BESS when it is required to be <b>charged</b> <b>or</b> discharged because it is already fully <b>charged</b> <b>or</b> discharged, respectively, <b>due</b> to the unavoidable forecast errors. The proposed method {{has been applied to}} the real world wind farm data which is scaled down for the simulation in order to demonstrate its effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can decrease the operation suspension due to non-functioning BESS and keep the BESS on, and help thus enable the wind dispatchability...|$|R

40|$|Core-level photoemission {{spectra of}} the Fabre salts with X = SbF 6 and PF 6 were taken using hard X-rays from PETRA III, Hamburg. In these salts TMTTF layers show a {{significant}} stack dimerization with a charge transfer of 1 e per dimer to the anion SbF 6 or PF 6. At room temperature and slightly below the core-level spectra exhibit single lines, characteristic for a well-screened metallic state. At reduced temperatures progressive charge localization sets in, {{followed by a}} 2 nd order phase transition into a charge-ordered ground state. In both salts groups of new core-level signals occur, shifted towards lower kinetic energies. This is indicative of a reduced transverse-conductivity across the anion layers, visible as layer-dependent charge depletion for both samples. The surface potential was traced via shifts of core-level signals of an adsorbate. A well-defined potential could be established by a conducting cap layer of 5 nm aluminum which appears “transparent” due to the large probing depth of HAXPES (8 – 10 nm). At the transition into the charge-ordered phase the fluorine 1 s line of (TMTTF) 2 SbF 6 shifts by 2. 8 eV to higher binding energy. This is a spectroscopic fingerprint {{of the loss of}} inversion symmetry accompanied by a cooperative shift of the SbF 6 anions towards the more positively charged TMTTF donors. This shift does not occur for the X = PF 6 compound, most likely due to smaller <b>charge</b> disproportion <b>or</b> <b>due</b> to thepresence of charge disorder...|$|R

40|$|Seeded {{emulsion}} polymerization {{is used to}} produce large quantities of shape anisotropic, amphoteric particles in a size range of about 1 ??m. Two different kinds of shape anisotropic particles are prepared for comparison to {{study the effects of}} incorporating pH-responsive groups on the properties of suspensions containing shape anisotropic colloidal particles. Copolymer dicolloids (CDC) containing pyridine groups are synthesized by swelling spherical, lightly cross linked polystyrene seeds with mixture of styrene and 2 -vinyl pyridine (2 VP) followed by secondary polymerization. Homopolymer dicolloids (HDC) are made in a similar procedure with only pure styrene swollen into seeds. To investigate the effects of weak attractions, the particles are coated with the nonionic surfactant hexaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C 12 E 6). As confirmed by electrophoretic mobility measurements as a function of pH, the CDC particles continue to show amphoteric properties. States of aggregation of dilute suspensions are mapped as functions of ionic strength and pH. The CDC particles show amphoteric behavior with strong attractions in medium pH range, while HDC remain stable at all pH???s studied (3 0. 5) with small linear elastic modulus (G 0 ???*) above ??g at different pH conditions and ionic strengths up to 0. 5 M proving again that the particles experience repulsive or weakly-attractive conditions. The CDC particles behave in a similar manner at high or low pH at an ionic strength, [I] of 0. 001 M, but gel at a volume fraction of ??g< 0. 3 and display anomalously large G 0 ???* at the gel transition at intermediate pH or at pH= 9 and I= 0. 5 M. The modulus and yielding behavior of these suspensions indicate that even at pH= 9 or pH= 3. 7 and I= 0. 001 the CDC particles experience weak attractions that cannot be explained as arising from isotropic repulsions as experienced by the HDC particles. At pH= 9 and I= 0. 5 M or pH= 4. 6 and I= 0. 001 M, these anomalous attractions are accentuated. These anomalous attractions are understood as arising from the chemical anisotropy of the CDC particles where the protrusion created in the second polymerization step is rich in poly- 2 VP while the seed is rich in negatively charged sulfate groups. These chemical differences can give rise to directional interactions due to differences in <b>charge</b> <b>or</b> <b>due</b> to differences in hydrophobicity. A key conclusion drawn from this work is that the signature of directional interactions comes in the way gels and glasses yield when stressed. Gel points are shifted by anisotropic interactions but the same gel points can be generated with isotropic interactions if the attractions are strong enough. Instead, gel composed of particles experiencing anisotropic chemical interactions yield with multiple constraints under conditions where this is not seen for particles with isotropic interactions...|$|R
40|$|Effect of Pd-, Pt-, Au-, and Ir-doping {{on the gas}} sensing {{properties}} of SnO 2 has been examined to methane and hydrogen at 200 - 600 ℃. All the metals examined suppressed conductivity of the oxide, {{probably due to the}} increased amount of negatively <b>charged</b> oxygen adsorbates, <b>or</b> <b>due</b> to some electronic interaction between the metals and the oxide. Sensitivity to methane increased with the Pd-, Pt-, and Au- doping, but decreased with Ir. On the other hand, sensitivity to hydrogen markedly increased with Pt and Au, but decreased with Pd. The results suggested that Pd-SnO 2 was appropriate to the detection of methane-rich gases, and Pt- or AU-SnO 2 to the selective detection of hydrogen. Stability of the noble metal- doped sensors was not good in general; for example, conductivity of Pd-SnO 2. which was most widely used in practice, gradually increased during the repetitive measurement by a heating and cooling cycle between 200 and 600 ℃.

40|$|The {{near-field}} Lienard-Wiechert potential {{solution of}} a longitudinally oscillating electrical field produced by an oscillating charge is presented, {{and the results}} are compared to the R. P. Feynman multipole far-field solution. The results indicate that the phase speed of a longitudinally oscillating electrical field is much faster than the speed of light in the near field. A similar analysis is presented for a longitudinally oscillating gravitational field produced by a vibrating mass. The result also indicates that the phase speed of a longitudinally oscillating gravitational field is also much faster than the speed of light in the near-field. The possibility of measuring the group speed of a longitudinally oscillating electrical field and a longitudinally oscillating gravitational field, which is commonly thought to be equal to the speed of light, is now being considered. The basic idea is to amplitude-modulate the longitudinal vibration of a <b>charge</b> <b>or</b> a mass and to measure the resultant longitudinal vibration of a nearby <b>charge</b> <b>or</b> a mass <b>due</b> to electrical <b>or</b> gravitational interaction. The modulation signal can then be extracted using a diode detector and the group speed can then be determined from the oscillation frequency, the separation distance between the masses, and the measurement of the phase shift of the modulation signal. If the group speed is equal to the speed of light, then phase shifts on the order of 1 microdegree could be generated with a typical experimental set-up. An analysis using the classical definition of group velocity for a longitudinally oscillating electrical field is presented, and the results indicate that the group speed is also much faster that the speed of light in the near field, which should not be possible due to causality violation.
