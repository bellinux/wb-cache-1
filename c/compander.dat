2500|$|Sound {{recording}} {{and reproduction is}} an electrical or mechanical inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog {{recording and}} digital recording. Analog (or analogue) recording (Greek, ana = [...] "according to" [...] and logos = [...] "relationship") is a technique used to store signals of audio or video information for later playback. In digital recording, the analog signal of video or sound is converted into a stream of discrete numbers, representing the changes in chroma and luminance values (video) orair-pressure (audio) through time, thus making an abstract template for the original sound or moving image. In 1967, the first digital audio magnetic tape recorder is invented. A 12-bit 30kHz stereo device using a <b>compander</b> to extend the dynamic range.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea of a}} <b>compander</b> for {{consumer}} devices was based on studies of a fixed two-band <b>compander</b> by Jürgen Wermuth of AEG-Telefunken ELA, Wolfenbüttel, developer of the Telefunken [...] four-band audio <b>compander</b> for professional use. In April 1974, the resulting [...] "RUSW-200" [...] prototype {{led to the development}} of a sliding two-band <b>compander</b> by Ernst F. Schröder of Telefunken Grundlagenlaboratorium, Hannover since July 1974. Finally, the released High&thinsp;Com system, which was marketed by Telefunken since 1978, worked as a broadband 2:1:2 <b>compander,</b> achieving around 10 dB of noise reduction for low and up to 20 dB A-weighted for higher frequencies, while avoiding most of the acoustic problems observed with other high compression broadband companders such as dbx.|$|E
5000|$|Besides Telefunken's own CN 750 High&thinsp;Com <b>compander</b> box and Nakamichi's High-Com II unit, other {{companies}} also offered external High&thinsp;Com <b>compander</b> boxes {{such as the}} Aiwa HR-7 and HR-50 or the Rotel RN-500 and RN-1000. A low-cost implementation of the Telefunken High&thinsp;Com system as external <b>compander</b> box became available as HobbyCom, promoted for do-it-yourself assembly in the popular WDR TV series [...] format by Jean Pütz in 1980.|$|E

5000|$|A {{sometimes}} noticeable {{artifact of}} dbx was [...] "breathing", as its <b>compander</b> rapidly increased and decreased the volume {{level of the}} background noise along with the music, which was most noticeable in quiet musical passages; this was a greater issue with dbx than with Dolby because its <b>compander</b> was more aggressive and worked across the frequency spectrum.|$|E

50|$|The final {{implementation}} {{replaced the}} integrator with a Predictor implemented with a two pole complex pair low-pass filter designed to approximate {{the long term}} average speech spectrum. The theory was that ideally the integrator should be a predictor designed to match the signal spectrum. A nearly perfect Shindler <b>Compander</b> replaced the modified version. It was found the modified <b>compander</b> resulted in a less than perfect step size at most signal levels and the fast gain error recovery increased the noise as determined by actual listening tests as compared to simple signal to noise measurements. The final <b>compander</b> achieved a very mild gain error recovery due to the natural truncation rounding error caused by twelve bit arithmetic.|$|E
50|$|The Dolby SR (Spectral Recording) noise {{reduction}} format {{was developed by}} Dolby Laboratories {{and has been in}} common use in professional audio since 1986 and in cinema audio since the late 1980s. It is a revised version of Dolby's earlier formats, combining aspects of Dolby A, B and C (e.g., sliding band and fixed band <b>companders)</b> to improve the dynamic range (i.e., the range in decibels between peak level and noise floor) of analogue recordings and transmissions by as much as 25 dB.|$|R
40|$|Voronoi {{cells for}} vector {{quantization}} subject to an entropy constraint are considered. It is {{shown that the}} constraint on the output entropy leads to a weaker and even vanishing dependency of the Voronoi cell’s volume on the probability density function. Using some simplifying assumptions like linearization of {{a small part of}} the –dimensional input space and modeling of the cell shapes as hyperspheres leads to an analytic expression of the quotient of the volumes of two neighboring Voronoi cells. The results confirm the use of entropy coded lattice vector quantizers with optimized reproduction vectors in cases of vanishing dependency and may in other cases be exploited for the design of vector <b>companders</b> to be used in conjunction with lattice vector quantization. ...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{publication}} in 1957 {{of the work}} of Andrei Kolmogorov 181 in mapping a function of multiple variables by means functions of a single variable, many mathematicians and engineers try, with different degree of success and not without controversy 1191. to find the direct application of it to multiple extremes problems, rooting of multivariate polynomials, neural networks and pattern recognition. This paper revisits the theorem from the optic of a generalised architecture for signal processing 1281.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to achieve efficient scalability in audio coders, and demonstrate its performance using the MPEG- 4 Advanced Audio Coder (AAC). In conventional scalable coding, the enhancement-layer performs straightforward re-quantization of the base-layer reconstruction error. This coding scheme implicitly discards useful information from the base-layer, and does not truly minimize a perceptually meaningful distortion criterion such as the noise-mask ratio. We reformulate the problem of scalable coding within a companding framework, and show that re-quantization in the <b>compander's</b> compressed domain achieves, in the asymptotic sense, optimal scalability. Based on this observation, we develop a scalable AAC coder which performs enhancement-layer quantization while exploiting all the information available at that layer. Simulation results of a two-layer scalable coder on the standard test database of 44. 1 kHz sampled audio show that the proposed approach yields substantial savings in bit rate for a given reproduction quality...|$|R
50|$|In the mid 20th century, a codec was {{a device}} that coded analog signals into digital form using pulse-code {{modulation}} (PCM). Later, the name was also applied to software for converting between digital signal formats, including <b>compander</b> functions.|$|E
5000|$|... 1967: {{the first}} {{monaural}} PCM recorder {{was developed by}} NHK's research facilities in Japan. The 30 kHz 12-bit device used a <b>compander</b> (similar to DBX Noise Reduction) to extend the dynamic range, and stored the signals on a video tape recorder.|$|E
50|$|In practice, companders are {{designed}} to operate according to relatively simple dynamic range compressor functions that {{are designed}} to be suitable for implementation using simple analog electronic circuits. The two most popular <b>compander</b> functions used for telecommunications are the A-law and μ-law functions.|$|E
40|$|In {{visible light}} {{communications}} (VLCs) relying on intensity-modulation and direct detection (IM/DD), the conversion from electrical signals to optical signals {{and the limited}} dynamic range of the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) constitute the fundamental impediments {{in the way of}} high-integrity communications, especially when orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is employed. In IM/DD VLCs, only real-valued positive signals are used for signal transmission. However, the Fourier transform of OFDM systems is operated in the complex domain. In order to meet the requirements of the IM/DD VLCs, the complex-to-real conversion is achieved at the cost of reducing the bandwidth efficiency. Moreover, OFDM signals experience a high peak-to-average power ratio; hence, typically clipping is used for confining the positive-valued signals within the LED's dynamic range. However, hard clipping leads to the loss of orthogonality for optical OFDM (O-OFDM) signals, generating inter-carrier interference. As a result, the performance of the clipping-based O-OFDM systems may be severely degraded. In this paper, the concept of piecewise companding transform (CT) is introduced into the O-OFDM system advocated, forming the CTO-OFDM arrangement. We first investigate the general principles and design criteria of the piecewise CTO-OFDM. Based on our studies, three types of piecewise <b>companders,</b> namely, the constant probability sub-distribution function, linear PsDF (LPsDF), and the non-LPsDF-based CT, are designed. Furthermore, we investigate the nonlinear effect of hard clipping and of our CT on O-OFDM systems in the context of different scenarios by both analytical and simulation techniques. Our investigations show that the CTO-OFDM constitutes a promising signaling scheme conceived for VLCs, which exhibits a high bandwidth efficiency, high flexibility, high reliability, as well as a high data-rate, despite experiencing nonlinear distortions...|$|R

A single 32-second sequence was standardized by the EBU in 1985, incorporating 13 tones (40 Hz-15 kHz at −12 dB) for frequency response measurement, two tones for distortion (1024 Hz/60 Hz at +9 dB) plus crosstalk and <b>compander</b> tests. This sequence, which began with a 110-baud FSK signal for synchronizing purposes, also became CCITT standard O.33 in 1985.|$|E

At last Sweden (the Televerket) decided to start broadcasting in stereo according to the pilot-tone system in 1977. But stereo radio was delayed in Sweden because of the two competing systems.|$|E
