25|$|The rated {{capacitance}} {{is the value}} for which the capacitor has been designed.

50|$|On the {{conducting}} surfaces, {{the resolution}} limit is estimated as 2 nm. For the high resolution, the quick analysis of <b>capacitance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>capacitor</b> with rough electrode is required.

5000|$|Capacitance can be {{calculated}} if the geometry of the conductors and the dielectric properties of the insulator between the conductors are known. A qualitative explanation for this can be given as follows. Once a positive charge is put unto a conductor, this charge creates an electrical field, repelling any other positive charge to be moved onto the conductor; i.e., increasing the necessary voltage. But if nearby there is another conductor with a negative charge on it, the electrical field of the positive conductor repelling the second positive charge is weakened (the second positive charge also feels the attracting force of the negative charge). So due to the second conductor with a negative charge, it becomes easier to put a positive charge on the already positive charged first conductor, and vice versa; i.e., the necessary voltage is lowered. As a quantitative example consider the <b>capacitance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>capacitor</b> constructed of two parallel plates both of area A separated by a distance d. If d is sufficiently small {{with respect to the}} smallest chord of A, there holds, to a high level of accuracy:where ...|$|E
30|$|The {{value of}} the {{specific}} <b>capacitance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>capacitor</b> depends {{on the type of}} the electrolyte, the structure and condition of the developed surface of the electrode material, and its pore size distribution.

50|$|The {{relative}} permittivity is <b>an</b> essential piece <b>of</b> information when designing capacitors, {{and in other}} circumstances where a material {{might be expected to}} introduce capacitance into a circuit. If a material with a high {{relative permittivity}} is placed in an electric field, the magnitude of that field will be measurably reduced within the volume of the dielectric. This fact is commonly used to increase the <b>capacitance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>capacitor</b> design. The layers beneath etched conductors in printed circuit boards (PCBs) also act as dielectrics.|$|R

Diarylethenes with different substituents are investigated and the modulation of the dipole moment is related to their chemical structures. We determine a modulation of the dipole moment up to 4 Debye. We discuss the model used to obtain the dipole moment from the capacitance measurements and we compare the experimental results with the outcomes from DFT calculations.

40|$|A general {{form for}} the surface {{roughness}} effects on the <b>capacitance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>capacitor</b> is proposed. We state that a capacitor with two uncoupled rough surfaces could be treated as two capacitors in series which have been divided from the mother capacitor by a slit. This {{is in contrast to}} the case where the two rough surfaces are coupled. When the rough surfaces are coupled, the type of coupling decides the modification of the capacitance in comparison to the uncoupled case. It is shown that if the coupling between the two surfaces of the capacitor is positive (negative), the capacitance is less (higher) than the case of two uncoupled rough plates. Also, we state that when the correlation length and the roughness exponent are small, the coupling effect is not negligible. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
40|$|Unpredictable {{power outages}} in NAND flashbased Solid State Drives (SSDs) may cause system failure or {{reliability}} problems. Capacitors are widely adopted as the interim power supplier when power interruption happens. However, since the energy provided by backup capacitors is limited, and the <b>capacitance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>capacitor</b> will gradually degrade with time, {{it is imperative}} to improve the efficiency and reliability of the backup process for SSDs with capacitors. This paper presents a novel backup scheme called SmartBackupfor MLC NAND flash-based SSDs with backup capacitors. In SmartBackup, by exploiting the feature of the discharge process of capacitors, all available SSD channels are fully utilized and dynamically adjusted based on the available voltage, so data can be efficiently stored in a reliable manner. Moreover, in SmartBackup, to write data in a time/energyefficient manner with better reliability, we adopt a fast and reliable programming strategy by only writing LSB (Least Significant Bit) pages in MLC NAND flash. To the best of our acknowledge, this is the first work to jointly utilize the property of the multi-page architecture of MLC NAND flash and the discharge characteristic of capacitors to improvethe efficiency and reliability of the backup process in SSDswith backup capacitors. The experimental results show thatSmartBackup can effectively accelerate the backup processand improve the reliability. Department of Computin...|$|E

40|$|Frazil ice is a {{phenomenon}} {{that takes place in}} cold regions when the water of rivers, lakes or oceans is cooled under 0 ºC. Several times during winter, frazil ice can appear at river Ätran, where Träbena hydropower plant is held by the company Wetterstad Consulting AB. Frazil ice particles contained in the flowing water are extremely sticky and adhere to any object placed in the water. Trash racks are used by the power plant at the water intakes to prevent any strange object to go into the turbines. However, frazil ice particles stick to the trash racks creating an ice blockage that interrupts the water inflow. In this situation, the power plant has to stop the production even for several months, {{due to the lack of}} water that reaches the turbines. In order to solve this problem, the company has installed a heating system on the trash racks that prevent the adhesion of frazil ice particles. This system is manually operated, and it is turned on or off based on the experience and predictions of the company. This heating system is very power consuming and every time it is turned on unnecessarily the company loses money. An automatic frazil ice detection system that turns on the heating system when needed is to be created. For that, several options have been analysed, and finally a capacitor-based sensor has been developed as a solution. The sensor consist of two steel plates coated with semi-transparent polycarbonate submerged underwater parallel placed in the space between the trash racks’ bars, forming this way a parallel plate capacitor. The <b>capacitance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>capacitor</b> depends exclusively on its geometry and the dielectric material between the plates. Hence when the water temperature is low enough, frazil ice particles stick to the plates of the capacitor and its capacitance will vary indicating that the accretion of frazil ice may block the water inflow. This variation is registered and a signal is send to the heating system to start operating. This way, the heating system is completely automated; no human intervention is needed at all. Developed for Wettestad Consulting AB. </p...|$|E
