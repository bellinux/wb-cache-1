40|$|Abstract We {{developed}} {{a model to}} predict the ram extrusion force of frictional plastic materials such as <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> pastes. The extrusion of <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> material has already been studied but interaction between shaping force and paste behaviour {{still has to be}} understood. Our model is based on the plastic frictional behaviour of <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> materials and integrates the physical mechanisms that govern material extrusion flow and extrusion force increase. When the process starts, a pressure gradient is created in the extruder due to wall friction of the paste which is submitted to plug flow. It induces a consolidation of the material. As a result, a large increase of extrusion force appears. A Coulomb law is used to model <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> materials which is considered as consolidating granular media. Such modelling is compared with experimental results. Tests were carried out on extrudible cement pastes. Modelling and experimental results are in good agreement.

2500|$|Liberty is a [...] tall statue made of Carrara marble which symbolizes {{liberty in}} the form of a young woman with {{idealized}} features. She stands with legs slightly apart and her proper left foot positioned in front of her body, while her proper right foot points away from her body at an approximately 45° angle. She wears a Hellenistic tunic which is pinned at each shoulder, exposing both arms and draping across her bust. The upper part of the tunic has slipped down on her proper right, exposing her shoulder. The tunic is cinched at the waist and falls in folds to her sandaled feet. Liberty is wrapped in a mantle, and gathers its folds at waist height in her proper left hand. Her proper right arm is extended towards the ground and positioned close to her body. Her proper right hand holds a long sword, the point of which rests on the base in between her feet. Liberty wears a Phrygian cap atop her hair, which is tied back at the base of her neck. One thick lock of hair falls down the middle of her back, while another is swept forward onto her proper right shoulder.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{influence}} of the types and addition dose of MgO expanding agent and the age of cement on expansion value and expansion performance of <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> material added with MgO expanding agent was systematically studied. The expansion characteristics of <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> material added with MgO expanding agent or calcium sulphoaluminate expanding agent were compared. The expansion of such material increases with the addition dose of MgO expanding agent and cement mortar age. During the test period, the expansion of <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> material increases continuously. The light-burned MgO expanding agent modified by CaO expanding agent is able to increase the 28 d expansion of such material effectively. The temperature of calcination for the heavy-burned MgO expanding agent is higher than that of light-burned one, thus the heavy-burned MgO expanding agent has a rather dense structure with slow hydration rate and gives a small expansion of the <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> material at early age, showing an obvious expansion delay. The calcium sulphoaluminate expanding agent gives most expansion of the material in the early 28 d and there is small expansion at middle and later age of the material...|$|R

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of fibre reinforcement in concrete, mortar and cement paste can enhance {{many of the}} engineering properties of the basic materials, such as fracture toughness, flexural strength and resistance to fatigue, impact, thermal shock and spalling. In recent years, {{a great deal of}} interest has been created worldwide on the potential applications of natural fibre reinforced, <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> composites. Investigations have been carried out in many countries on various mechanical properties, physical performance and durability of <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> matrices reinforced with naturally occurring fibres including sisal, coconut, jute, bamboo and wood fibres. These fibres have always been considered promising as reinforcement of <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> matrices because of their availability, low cost and low consumption of energy.

40|$|Abstract. This paper gives a {{comprehensive}} investigation {{on the effects}} of undercalcined MgO-based expansive agent (UMEA) on the shrinkage and associated cracking behavior of <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> materials, including length change under drying condition and restrained condition, and cracking under single-ring restraint. Experimental results showed that the UMEA could reduce the drying shrinkage as well as restrained shrinkage of <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> materials effectively. The measured shrinkage reduction was up to 55. 3 % at the age of 180 d of drying. It was also found that the addition of shrinkage could effectively improve the shrinkage cracking resistance of <b>cement</b> <b>based</b> materials even under drying condition. The experimental results of autoclaving testing showed that the UMEA has a larger dosage of stability. If the dosage in cement is controlled according to the requirement of concrete construction, the UMEA can be used to compensate the shrinkage as designed...|$|R
