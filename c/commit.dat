40|$|Abstract. We suggest {{practical}} sub-linear size zero-knowledge {{arguments for}} statements involving linear algebra. Given commitments to matrices over a finite field, we give a sub-linear size zero-knowledge argument that one <b>committed</b> matrix {{is the product}} of two other <b>committed</b> matrices. We also offer a sub-linear size zero-knowledge argument for a <b>committed</b> matrix being equal to the Hadamard product of two other <b>committed</b> matrices. Armed with these tools we can give many other sub-linear size zero-knowledge arguments, for instance for a <b>committed</b> matrix being upper or lower triangular, a <b>committed</b> matrix being the inverse of another <b>committed</b> matrix, or a <b>committed</b> matrix being a permutation of another <b>committed</b> matrix. A special case of what can be proved using our techniques is the satisfiability of an arithmetic circuit wit...|$|R

To address this goal we performed a case study that included the manual classi-fication of large <b>commits</b> of nine open source projects. The contributions include a taxonomy of large <b>commits,</b> which are grouped according to their intention. We contrast large <b>commits</b> against small <b>commits</b> and show that large com-mits are more perfective while small <b>commits</b> are more cor-rective. These large <b>commits</b> provide us with a window on the development practices of maintenance teams...|$|R

5|$|The role {{of intent}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions.
