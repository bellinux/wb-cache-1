25|$|Before {{headlining}} {{their own}} tours, Mindless Behavior toured with many established musicians, such as The Backstreet Boys, Jason Derulo, Justin Bieber, {{and was an}} opening act for Janet Jackson during her Number Ones, Up Close and Personal tour. The group had become quite popular from appearing on BET's 106 & Park, and also headlined the first BET <b>Closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> Dreams Tour alongside Diggy Simmons, Lil Twist, Trevante and Jawan Harris. In 2011, Mindless Behavior headlined the Scream Tour with Diggy Simmons, which featured The OMG Girlz, Jacob Latimore, and Hamilton Park. The group also performed at the White House twice and were the first African American boy band to do so. Also in 2011, they performed at the prestigious White House Easter Egg Roll. In 2012, they were performers at Arthur Ashe Kids' Day. In 2013, the group performed for Wade's World Foundation, an organization by Dwyane Wade that provides support to community-based organizations that promote education, health and social skills for children in at-risk situations. They were also welcomed back to the White House to perform at the Kids Inaugural Ball.|$|E
2500|$|Rocko's design {{changed as}} his {{character}} evolved. The {{first version of}} the character was Travis. Murray said [...] "I liked him, but changed him considerably for Rocko." [...] Murray said that the version placed in the Rocko's Modern Life proposal was [...] "much looser, and <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> independent film style." [...] Murray did not consider how the character would be animated, as Murray {{did not believe that}} the character would be animated. When the pilot for Rocko's Modern Life was approved, Murray began streamlining the character so that others could easily draw him. Murray said that one could perceive a difference between the character as he appears in the original model sheet used in the original animation versus the character as he appears in the animation produced abroad. Murray continued to streamline Rocko so that overseas studios could easily draw him. Murray and the directors had become so accustomed to quickdrawing Rocko that the changes in the character, in his words, [...] "naturally occurred, lending more to the happy personality Rocko had developed into ( [...] less the victim, paranoid one from the beginning)." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{had taken}} the {{precaution}} to leave the wicket-gate on the latch. With my foot I pushed it open, and, keeping well {{under the cover of}} the tall convent wall, I ran swiftly to the corner of the Rue des Pipots. Here I paused a moment. Through the silence of the night my ear caught the faint sound of horses snorting and harness jingling in the distance, both sides from where I stood; but of gendarmes or passers-by there was no sign.

She looked over her shoulder and her arched eyebrows frowned above her blanched face. It was almost a scowl. Then the expression changed.

I took off my hat at last, but the dog hanging out his tongue with that cheerfully imbecile expression some dogs know so well how to put on when it suits their purpose, pretended to be deaf." ...|$|E

60|$|On the Wednesday of {{that same}} week the news of my father's sudden and serious illness {{came to me in}} a telegram, and by the time I arrived at home {{it was too late to}} see him again alive. It was my first {{experience}} with death, and what perplexed me continually during the following days was an inability to feel the loss more deeply. When a child, I had been easily shaken by the spectacle of sorrow. Had I, during recent years, as a result of a discovery that emotions arising from human relationships lead to discomfort and suffering, deliberately been forming a shell, until now I was incapable of natural feelings? Of late I had seemed <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father, and his letters, though formal, had given evidence of his affection; in his repressed fashion he had made it clear that he looked forward to the time when I was to practise with him. Why was it then, as I gazed upon his fine features in death, that I experienced no intensity of sorrow? What was it in me that would not break down? He seemed worn and tired, yet I had never thought of him as weary, never attributed to him any yearning. And now he was released.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Arbuton {{seems to}} have lived {{in a world where}} {{everything}} is regulated by some rigid law that it would be death to break. Then, you know, at home we are always talking about people, and discussing them; but we always talk of each person for what he is in himself, and I always thought a person could refine himself if he tried, and was sincere, and not conceited. But he seems to judge people according to their origin and locality and calling, and to believe that all refinement must come from just such training and circumstances as his own. Without exactly saying so, he puts everything else quite out of the question. He doesn't appear to dream that there can be any different opinion. He tramples upon all that I have been taught to believe; and though I cling the <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> idols, I can't help, now and then, trying myself by his criterions; and then I find myself wanting in every civilized trait, and my whole life coarse and poor, and all my associations hopelessly degraded. I think his ideas are hard and narrow, and I believe that even my little experience would prove them false; but then, they are his, and I can't reconcile them with what I see is good in him." ...|$|E

So, though I offend some, I shall yet convince all, the which lieth <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> purpose.

This much I shall say as to the time of these happenings, and no more.
