40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that the risk of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL±P) and {{isolated}} cleft palate (CP) is influenced by genetic variation at several loci and that the relation between specific genetic variants and disease risk may be modified by environmental factors. The present study evaluated potential associations between CL±P and CP and two putative clefting susceptibility loci, MSX 1 and TGFB 3, using data from a nationwide case-control study conducted in Denmark from 1991 to 1994. The potential effects of interactions between these genes and two common environmental exposures, first trimester exposure to maternal cigarette smoke and alcohol intake, were also examined. Analyses of these data provide evidence of an association between the risk of CP and variation at the TGFB 3 locus. However, {{there is no evidence that}} the risk of CL±P or CP is influenced by gene-environment interactions involving MSX 1 or TGFB 3 and either first trimester exposure to maternal cigarette smoke or alcohol <b>consumption.</b> <b>Am</b> J Epidemiol 2001; 153 : 1007 – 15. case-control studies; cleft lip; cleft palate; genetics Received for publication March 15, 2000, and accepted for publi-cation September 29, 2000.

40|$|Objectives. We {{investigated}} whether taxing sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) {{would improve}} the diets of households in Brazil. Methods. We used household food consumption data that the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics collected in 2002 - 2003 from a nationally representative sample of 48470 Brazilian households. The consumption of SSBs is expressed as the total SSB calories consumed and as the SSB {{percentage of the total}} calories purchased. We investigated price elasticity with regression models, controlling for demographic variables, income, and prices of all other foods and drinks. Results. Increases in the price of SSBs led to reductions in consumption. A 1. 00 % increase in the price of SSBs led to a 0. 85 % reduction of SSB calories consumed (1. 03 % reduction for the poor and 0. 63 % for the nonpoor). Increased income had a positive effect on SSB consumption, but the effect was less than half the size of the price elasticity (0. 41 % increase in SSB calories consumed for every 1. 00 % increase in income). Conclusions. High SSB price elasticity in Brazil indicates that a tax on purchased weight or volume would lead to reductions in SSB <b>consumption.</b> (<b>Am</b> J Public Health. 2012; 102 : 178 - 183. doi: 10. 2105 /AJPH. 2011. 300313) Sao Paulo State Research Foundation [2007 / 00064 - 8]Sao Paulo State Research Foundatio...|$|E

40|$|Background: Undernutrition is a {{risk factor}} for {{increased}} mor-tality in older adults. Therapeutic intervention includes the administration of liquid dietary supplements. Objective: We investigated the effect of liquid dietary supple-ments on satiation, satiety, and energy intake in older adults. Design: This study had 2 phases in a within-subject, repeated-measures design. The energy intake of 15 elderly (aged> 70 y) and 15 younger (aged 20 – 40 y) healthy subjects was measured after 4 liquid preloads: water, high fat, high carbohydrate, and high pro-tein. The preloads were administered within 5 min of a test meal in phase 1 and ≥ 60 min before the test meal in phase 2. Palatability, fullness, and hunger were assessed by using visual analogue scales. Results: Mean energy consumption of the test meals was signi-ficantly lower in the older than in the younger subjects (P = 0. 001), as was mean macronutrient consumption of fat and carbohydrate (P = 0. 002 and 0. 001, respectively). Mean energy intake and macronutrient consumption were higher in phase 2 than in phase 1 in both older and younger subjects (P < 0. 05). Satiety lasted longer in older than in younger subjects after the high-protein and high-fat preloads (P = 0. 001).

40|$|A reduced {{risk for}} Parkinson’s disease (PD) among {{cigarette}} smokers {{has been observed}} consistently during the past 30 years. Recent evidence suggests that caffeine may also be protective. Findings are presented regarding associations of PD with smoking, caffeine intake, and alcohol consumption from a case-control study conducted in western Washington State in 1992 – 2000. Incident PD cases (n = 210) and controls (n = 347), frequency matched on gender and age were identified from enrollees of the Group Health Cooperative health maintenance organization. Exposure data were obtained by in-person questionnaires. Ever having smoked cigarettes {{was associated with a}} reduced risk of PD (odds ratio (OR) = 0. 5, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 4, 0. 8). A stronger relation was found among current smokers (OR = 0. 3, 95 % CI: 0. 1, 0. 7) than among ex-smokers (OR = 0. 6, 95 % CI: 0. 4, 0. 9), and there was an inverse gradient with pack-years smoked (trend p < 0. 001). No associations were detected for coffee consumption or total caffeine intake or for alcohol consumption. However, reduced risks were observed for consumption of 2 cups/day or more of tea (OR = 0. 4, 95 % CI: 0. 2, 0. 9) and two or more cola drinks/day (OR = 0. 6, 95 % CI: 0. 3, 1. 4).

Our goals were to examine 1) the effect of exogenous application of a cofactor for NOS, i. e., tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) on the reac-tivity of pial arterioles during alcohol consumption; and 2) endothelial NOS (eNOS) protein in nonalcohol-fed and alco-hol-fed rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed liquid diets with or without alcohol for 2 – 3 mo. We measured in vivo diameter of pial arterioles in response to NOS-dependent agonists (ACh and ADP) and a NOS-independent agonist (nitroglyc-erin) before and during application of BH 4. Blood vessels were then harvested for Western blot analysis of eNOS pro-tein. In nonalcohol-fed rats, ACh and ADP produced vasodi-latation, which was impaired in alcohol-fed rats. Vasodilata-tion to nitroglycerin was similar in both groups of rats. Application of BH 4 did not alter vasodilatation in nonalcohol-fed rats but improved impaired vasodilatation in alcohol-fed rats. Also, eNOS protein in cerebral cortex microvessels, the basilar artery, and aorta was not different between nonalco-hol-fed and alcohol-fed rats. Thus impaired NOS-dependent vasodilatation during alcohol consumption {{does not appear to}} be related to an alteration in eNOS protein but may be related to a deficiency and/or alteration in the utilization of BH 4. rats; reactivity; brain; cerebral arterioles; stroke; acetylcho-line; adenosine 59 -diphospate; nitroglycerin; endothelial ni-tric oxide synthase protein PROLONGED, HEAVY CONSUMPTION of alcohol and binge drinking can contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebro-vascular disorders, including hemorrhagic and ische...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an {{emerging}} manufacturing technology called Additive Manufacturing (AM) {{and its potential}} to become a more efficient and cleaner manufacturing alternative. This work is built around selected case companies, where the benefit of AM compared to other more traditional technologies is studied through the comparison of resource consumption. The resource consumption is defined as raw materials and energy input. The scope of this work is the application of AM in the scale model kit industry. The method used is the life cycle inventory study, which is a subtype of life cycle assessment (LCA). The result of {{the paper is the}} quantification of raw materials and energy consumption. The outcomes shows that AM has higher efficiency in terms of materials usage, as a higher proportion of materials ending up in the final product. Injection Molding (IM), on the other hand, wastes a significant proportion of raw materials in components that {{are not part of the}} final product. If the same or similar raw materials are used in both manufacturing methods, the advantage is clearly with AM. However, AM has higher energy consumption in comparison to the injection molding technique (IM). In terms of energy <b>consumption,</b> <b>AM</b> only has an advantage in this area when working with a very low production volume. The analysis of the energy consumption shows that most of the energy used in AM is to create the final product, while IM only uses a fraction of the total energy to produce the final product. AM technologies are still very new but have the potential for development and reduction of energy consumption in the future. Added to this potential is the higher materials usage efficiency of AM, which reduce the waste of materials and the energy, embedded in them. These two factors are likely to position AM as cleaner manufacturing alternative...|$|E
