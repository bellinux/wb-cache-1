40|$|In this paper, the DSSC safety-interlock {{system is}} introduced. It is {{designed}} to keep the DSSC mega-pixel camera in a safe-state. The system is composed of four inter-communicating sub-systems referred here as a master SIB (safety-interlock board) and three partner SIBs. Each SIB monitors and processes 75 temperature sensors mainly located in the focal plane and also distributed inside the camera-head electronics. It monitors the signals from two pressure sensors, one humidity sensor {{as well as the}} connectivity to sixteen low-voltage and two high-voltage cables. The master SIB supervises the signals to and from external equipments like the <b>cooling</b> <b>system,</b> <b>pressure</b> gauge, power crates and status information from experimental environment. SIB is an 8 -layer printed-circuit board (PCB) with a micro-controller sitting on top as its central processing unit. A decision-matrix software reads the sensor status continuously and determines whether the camera is in a safe state or not. All error and warnings flags are sent to the detector control software framework and the end user directly. These flags are also stored every 100 ms together with the image data. The full SIB sensor data is sent to the back end for offline analysis. A shutdown sequence is initiated by SIB in case of a critical failure. The safety-interlock philosophy, hardware design, and software architecture along with test results will be presented. Comment: 2016 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record (NSS/MIC...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{tendency}} to increase the economic efficiency of engine operation and energy efficiency and reduce emissions of toxic combustion products. One way to reduce emissions of toxic components in exhaust gases is raising the coolant boiling point, which requires the simultaneous increase in <b>pressure</b> in the <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> Previous studies suggest that such a system can reduce the amount of toxic components in exhaust gases, particularly at low engine load when the engine exhaust temperature is too low to make effective catalytic action. The paper presents the model and experimental test stands to research the <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> at an elevated temperature of the coolant. The speed and load characteristics of the standard <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> and <b>pressure</b> were presented. The research results were designed to determine the effect of elevated temperature in the <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> on the composition of the gases.

ChapmanThe {{purpose of}} this thesis is to present on the {{development}} and results of the <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> logic tree and model developed {{as part of the}} Pipeline Research Council International, Inc (PRCI) funded project at the Kansas State National Gas Machinery Laboratory. PRCI noticed that many of the legacy engines utilized in the natural gas transmission industry were plagued by <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> problems. As such, a need existed to better understand the heat transfer mechanisms from the combusting gases to the cooling water, and then from the cooling water to the environment. To meet this need, a logic tree was developed to provide guidance on how to balance and identify problems within the <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and schedule appropriate maintenance. Utilizing information taken from OEM operating guides, a <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> model was developed to supplement the logic tree in providing further guidance and understanding of <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> operation. The <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> model calculates the heat loads experienced within the engine <b>cooling</b> <b>system,</b> the <b>pressures</b> within the <b>system,</b> and the temperatures exiting the cooling equipment. The <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> engineering model was developed based upon the fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and heat transfer experienced by the coolant within the system.

40|$|Various {{types of}} {{equipment}} malfunctions, operator errors, and abnormal occurrences {{that may occur}} with moderate frequency can cause an unplanned increase in reactor coolant inventory. Depending on the boron concentration and temperature of the injected water and {{the response of the}} automatic control systems, a power level increase may result and lead to fuel damage or over-pressurization of the reactor coolant system. Alternatively, a power level decrease and depressurization may result. The reactor will trip from high water level, high flux, or high or low pressure. This SRP section is intended to be applicable to these types of moderate frequency events that increase reactor coolant inventory.

As the result, the trend of reduction of energy consumption has been determined if the proportional pressure control mode is used in comparison with constant differential pressure control mode. The control modes are compared if the value of the duty point remains invariable for both modes.

There is also the change of efficiency level of circulators has been investigated in the article. It has been done at different deviations from nominal pump head. The regression equation with coefficient of determination has been derived. Finally, it has been derived that the efficiency level drops up to 3 % if variable speed centrifugal pumps are applied, and the deviation of the head value of best efficiency point (BEP) is up to 30 % from its nominal value. A slight decrease of efficiency level is observed if the deviation from the nominal head value is up to 30 %.

District <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is widely used but its performance is rarely reported. The system performance compared with the individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> determines its future application. Performance assessment of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> is conducted by comparing with individual <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> in subtropical areas. Characteristics of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> are summarized after quantitative energy performance analysis. Measures to handle the additional peak electricity load due to developing a new area and using district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> are assessed. Application of ice storage systems in the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is evaluated under different tariffs and design strategies. The performance of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> integrated with PHES is analyzed. The operation costs of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> with and without combined cooling, heating and power system are compared. Comments and suggestions are summarized for the application of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> in the subtropical area. Information or data used in the system design at planning and design stages are often very different from that when the system is in operation. Such difference is taken as uncertainty. Uncertainty exists widely in the design process of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> It will affect the design options but is not sufficiently investigated yet. To ensure that the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> perform well in operation eventually, uncertainty-based optimal design methods are proposed. The performance of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> using the proposed methods is compared with that using the conventional design method. An optimal design method concerning uncertainty is developed based on mini-max regret theory. It achieves the optimal design considering uncertainty. Without the needs of probability distribution assumptions and introducing new models, this method can determine the uncertainty-based optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> very effectively. By comparing the regrets of each design option, the uncertainty-based optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> can be identified, which is associated with the minimum maximum regret. The method is demonstrated {{in the design of the}} chiller plant and chilled water system of a building. By quantifying the uncertainty at planning and design stages, an uncertainty-based optimal design method is proposed and its application steps are introduced. Uncertainties in the outdoor weather, building design/construction and indoor conditions are concerned. Strategies to deal with the variables containing uncertainties are introduced. Based on the peak cooling load distribution, the capacity of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> can be determined with quantified risks. Based on the distribution of the annual energy consumption or cost, the configuration of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> can be selected with quantified confidence. The uncertainty-based optimal method is implemented in a district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and an individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> in Hong Kong respectively. By using the uncertainty-based optimal design method, stake holders can make decisions with quantified confidence. The components or sub-systems in a <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> cannot be always available due to failures or maintenance. A robust optimal design method considering both uncertainty and reliability is proposed. The robust optimal design can maintain the good performance under uncertainty or failures of components in the <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> Steps to realize the robust optimal design method are presented. The availability risk cost is introduced to account for the losses caused by the unmet cooling load. By taking the total annual cost including the capital cost, operation cost and availability risk cost as the objective, the robust optimal <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> can be achieved. The proposed method is demonstrated in both the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system.</b> Performance of the <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> using the robust optimal design is compared with that using the conventional design method, uncertainty-based design method and reliability-based design method. The impacts of uncertainty on the design of district <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> are compared. The influential factors for cooling loads of the district <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> and individual <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> are identified. Similarities and differences are summarized.

The notebook computer is not an exception, and innovative thermal management solutions must be employed {{to compensate for the}} increased heat dissipation in the space-constrained enclosures. The majority of current <b>cooling</b> <b>systems</b> in laptop computers rely on heat pipes attached to a remote heat exchanger with micro-fans providing forced convection to reject heat to the ambient, however this technique can not accommodate the increasing heat fluxes in the confined laptop enclosure. In this study, a two-phase closed loop <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is designed and tested for a laptop computer. The <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> consists of an evaporator structure containing boiling structures connected to a compact condenser with mini fans providing external forced convection. A pump is also incorporated to assist the return of the condensate back to the evaporator. The <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> is characterized by a parametric study which determines the effects of volume fill ratio of coolant, initial <b>system</b> <b>pressure,</b> and pump flow rate on the thermal performance of the closed loop. Experimental data shows the optimum parametric values which can dissipate 25 W of chip power with a chip temperature maintained at 95 C. Numerical analysis provides additional data to further enhance the heat dissipation from the external air-cooled side of the condenser by studying the effects of ventilation and air flow rate across the system.

These alloys {{are considered to be}} difficult to machine due to their rigidity and poor thermal conductivity. High-pressure jet-assisted machining of titanium alloys is beneficial. It not only increases production efficiency, by increasing the cutting speed and lowering temperature both in cutting zone and the cutting tool, but also improves chip control, and increases tool life. It also produces better surface integrity and compress residual stress, which improves the properties of work metals such as fatigue. In order to compare the effect of high-pressure jet-assisted machining on the work pieces of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy, the depth profile of residual stress was measured using xray diffraction. As comparison, the depth profile of residual stress was also measured for the conventional machined work pieces. It was found that the residual stress was a function of machining parameters, such as cutting speed, feeding force and depth of cut and particularly the high-pressure jet increases the amount of residual compressional stresses in both cutting and feed direction. In the present paper, Ti 6 A 14 V rod was machined by turning in two different manners, finishing and roughing.

The mass recovery scheme utilizes this pressure difference to enhance the refrigerant mass circulation. Average Cooling Capacity (ACC) and Coefficient of Performance (COP) were calculated by computer simulation to analyze the influences of operating conditions. The results show that the average cooling capacity of mass recovery system is superior to that of conventional system. It is also seen that mass recovery process enhances the overall performances of solar driven chiller and there is an optimum mass recovery time for an adsorption <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> with direct solar couplin...|$|R
40|$|In a 2 -pass <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> the <b>pressure</b> {{driven air}} flow dis-tribution is {{investigated}} experimentally using the non-intrusive PIV Technique. The generic model {{as part of}} a complex and sophisticated <b>cooling</b> <b>system</b> consists of two square-sectioned ducts with a length of 20 diameters and an inherent 180 degree bend. The system has been investigated basically with smooth walls (case 0) and, later on, with two different kinds of ribbed walls in both legs. Ribs are applied to enhance the cooling performance; they are placed on two opposite walls of both legs in a symmetric (case A) and an asymmetric manner (case B), respectively. The ribs are inclined with an angle of 45 degrees versus the duct axis (i. e. main flow direction). The applied rib lay-out is well-proved and optimized with respect to heat trans-fer improvement and the inherent pressure drop increase. The system rotates about an axis orthogonal to the centreline of the straight passes. The configuration was analyzed with the planar the two-component Particle Image Velocimetry (2 C PIV), which is capable of obtaining complete maps of the instantaneous as well as the averaged flow field even at high turbulence levels, which are typically present within duct turns, near ribs and, above all, during rotation. The presented investigations were conducted in stationary and rotating mode. Especially in the bend region separation phenomena and vortices with high local turbulence are apparent. The presence of ribs changes the fluid motion by generating additional vortices impinging the side walls. Flow visualization with injected oil smoke using the laser light sheet visualization technique was helpful to detect vortex structures and separations. Especially in the bend area separation regions and vortices with high local turbulence are apparent. The results shown in this paper demonstrate the effect of the 180 degree bend in combination with the two rib turbulator geometries for isothermal flow conditions excluding any buoy-ancy with and without rotation. Turbulent channel flow was investigated at a Reynolds number of 50, 000, derived with the hydraulic diameter of the pass, non-rotating and at a rotation number of 0. 02 which was chosen still moderate. Engine rele-vant rotation numbers are in order of. 1 or higher. A reconstruc-tion of model mountings will allow higher values for the next tests. Future work will expand to higher rotational speed and, also, will include buoyancy effects. This investigation shall help to clarify the complex flow phenomena due to the interaction of several vortices, present in two-pass <b>cooling</b> <b>systems.</b> The flow maps obtained with PIV are of good quality and high spatial resolution and therefore provide a test case for the development and validation of nu-merical simulation tools like the DLR flow solver TRACE which is not a topic of this paper...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} unit associated to the Laboratory Systems for Technology Innovation (LaSTIn) of the Department of Architecture and Design {{as well as}} the Department of Energy, Polytechnic University of Turin, has investigated the possibility of producing a modular wall system for hybrid/natural passive <b>cooling.</b> This <b>system</b> uses <b>pressure</b> differences typical of natural air movements and it is conceived as a mean to reach a quasi-zero-energy building as foreseen by Dir. 2010 / 31 /EU by 2020 for new constructions. In addition, it realises a high level of technological and architectural integration in building constructions. The research focuses on passive and solar cooling techniques and studies the following possible systems, designed and tested separately in laboratory: a) latent heat adsorption cells including silica gel and zeolites for controlling the specific air humidity content, with heat regeneration by a vacuum water solar collectors system; b) a low-pressure heat exchanger, with crossing flows through ducts of rectangular section, to recover sensible heat/cold from return air; c) a passive evaporative cooling element.
