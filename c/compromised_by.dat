5|$|By 1917, the American diocese was {{the largest}} in the Russian Orthodox Church. It had grown from ten parishes in 1890 to more than 350. Most of the funding for the diocese was {{provided}} by Russian Church, via the Imperial Missionary Society. The connections between the American diocese and the Russian Church would be severely <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> the events of that year.|$|E
5|$|However, {{towards the}} end of his reign Manuel's {{achievements}} in the east were <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> a serious defeat at Myriokephalon, which in large part resulted from his arrogance in attacking a well-defended Seljuk position. Although the Byzantines recovered and Manuel concluded an advantageous peace with Sultan Kilij Arslan II, Myriokephalon proved to be the final, unsuccessful effort by the empire to recover the interior of Anatolia from the Turks.|$|E
5|$|The Bedouins, the Ghatafan {{and other}} Confederates from Najd {{had already been}} <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> Muhammad's negotiations. They had taken part in the {{expedition}} in hopes of plunder, rather than any particular prejudice against Islam. They lost hope as chances of success dwindled, uninterested in continuing the siege. The two confederate armies were marked by recriminations and mutual distrust.|$|E

5|$|The {{convention}} ultimately <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> loosening suffrage requirements. It also {{reduced the}} number of delegates and senators to the Virginia General Assembly. The resulting constitution was ratified by a popular majority, though most of the voters {{in the western part of}} the state ended up voting against it. Thus, the underlying intrastate tensions remained, and would have to be addressed later.|$|E
5|$|Etruria {{spent her}} early {{career with the}} main fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. In the early 1900s, she {{spent much of her}} time in North and South American waters; she visited the United States for the Jamestown Exposition and the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1907 and 1909. The ship took part in the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, {{primarily}} by providing gunfire support to Italian troops in North Africa. Reduced to a training ship by World War I, Etruria was deliberately sunk by the Regia Marina in Livorno to convince Austria-Hungary that its espionage network had not been <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> double agents.|$|E
5|$|Frank Elgyn (Michael Wincott), the Betty captain, is Sabra Hillard's lover. Elgyn has {{an illegal}} {{partnership}} with General Martin Perez {{in which he}} delivers materials off the books to expedite the Auriga research and other activities. Elgyn delivers a shipment of humans in cryostasis, which are used as incubators for the Aliens. Elgyn and Perez maintain an understanding {{that there will be}} no disruptive activity aboard the station. This agreement is later <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> Call by her contact with Ripley 8. Shortly after the Aliens escape captivity, Elgyn is killed when one of them pulls him through floor grates and impales him.|$|E

5|$|Hemingway's {{behavior}} during his final {{years had been}} {{similar to that of}} his father's before he killed himself; his father may have had the genetic disease hemochromatosis, due to which the inability to metabolize iron culminates in mental and physical deterioration. Medical records made available in 1991 confirm that Hemingway had been diagnosed with hemochromatosis in early 1961. His sister Ursula and his brother Leicester also killed themselves. In addition to being affected by his physical ailments, Hemingway's health was <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> his having been a heavy drinker for most of his life.|$|E
5|$|His health declining, Baltimore's {{persistence}} {{over the}} charter finally {{paid off in}} 1632. The king first granted him a location south of Jamestown, but Baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in settling the new land of Carolina into a sugar plantation. Baltimore eventually <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> accepting redrawn boundaries {{to the north of}} the Potomac River, on either side of the Chesapeake Bay. The charter was about to pass when the fifty-two-year-old Baltimore died in his lodgings at Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 15 April 1632. Five weeks later, on 20 June 1632, the charter for Maryland passed the seals.|$|E
5|$|In early 1941 the 6th Division and ICorps {{headquarters}} {{took part}} in the ill-fated Allied expedition to defend Greece from a German invasion. The corps' commander, Lieutenant-General Thomas Blamey, and Prime Minister Menzies both regarded the operation as risky, but agreed to Australian involvement after the British Government provided them with briefings which deliberately understated the chance of defeat. The Allied force deployed to Greece was much smaller than the German force in the region and the defence of the country was <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> inconsistencies between Greek and Allied plans.|$|E

5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of American foreign policy. Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American foreign policy establishment but his efforts were <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> a pair of diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA has {{a command}} {{structure}} {{similar to the}} Provisional IRA, with a seven-member Army Council consisting of a chief of staff, quartermaster general, director of training, director of operations, director of finance, director of publicity, and adjutant general. The rank-and-file members operate in active service units of covert cells to prevent the organisation from being <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> informers. As of June 2005, the organisation {{is believed to have}} a maximum of about 150 members, according to a statement by the Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and mooring rings, would significantly reduce the risk to shipping.|$|E

5|$|The {{damage to}} Formby's lungs from the {{accident}} was exacerbated by tuberculosis, {{and he began to}} miss an increasing number of his appearances. In 1917 the Southport Palladium took court action against him for failing to fulfil a theatrical engagement as contracted, whereupon his lawyer said that Formby was dying of the lung disease and was working for the short time he had left for the benefit of his large family. Formby lost the case: his plea of ill-health was <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> his accepting an engagement elsewhere at the same time.|$|E
5|$|These were {{years of}} tension in policy towards France, with Walsingham sceptical of the {{unpredictable}} Henry III and distrustful of the English ambassador in Paris, Edward Stafford. Stafford, who was <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> his gambling debts, {{was in the}} pay of the Spanish and passed vital information to Spain. Walsingham may {{have been aware of}} Stafford's duplicity, as he fed the ambassador false information, presumably in the hope of fooling or confusing the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} Governor Chiles published {{a report in}} 1995 stating that South Florida was unable to sustain its growth, and {{the deterioration of the}} environment was negatively affecting daily life for residents in South Florida. The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial interests if no actions were taken to halt current trends. Results of an eight-year study that evaluated the C were submitted to the United States Congress in 1999. The report warned that if no action was taken the region would rapidly deteriorate. A strategy called the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was enacted to restore portions of the Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, the Caloosahatchee River, and Florida Bay to undo the damage of the past 50years. It would take 30years and cost $7.8billion to complete. Though the plan was passed into law in 2000, it has been <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> politics and funding problems.|$|E

5|$|As Q3 started, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Lewis Hamilton would be unable to take part, suffering from a hybrid system failure in the turbo charger, the same problem that had plagued him in China two weeks earlier. Nico Rosberg went on to secure pole position, even though his last timed lap was <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> a tyre lockup into turn 13. Sebastian Vettel was closest to Rosberg, but a five-place grid penalty meant that he would start the race from seventh on the grid, moving Valtteri Bottas into the first row. Kimi Räikkönen was fourth fastest, ahead of Massa, Ricciardo, Pérez, Kvyat and Verstappen. After qualifying, Mercedes decided to switch Hamilton's car back to his spare power unit, which had been rebuilt following its failure at the Chinese Grand Prix, thereby avoiding a grid penalty, which they would have incurred if a new power unit would have been installed. Williams were satisfied with their pace in qualifying, praising the advances they made in slow-corner speed.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E
5|$|If the Bismarck {{has been}} intercepted or <b>compromised</b> <b>by</b> Royal Navy ships, {{the game will}} {{automatically}} shift to an arcade sequence which will give the player an opportunity to defend the ship against a British attack, or alternatively, if playing as the British, the sequence is utilised in order to destroy the Bismarck. The feature can be displayed at any time, though it is automatically enabled if either side comes into conflict. The interface of the feature is split into three sections; {{the upper part of}} the screen shows a view of the ocean in front of the ship and any hostile ship in the vicinity. The middle section contains buttons and icons which are used to control ship movement and to fire weapons. The lower part of the screen displays a diagrammatic representation of the ship from the side chosen (Bismarck or Royal Navy ships); the diagram will change colours once the ship receives damage from shelling.|$|E
