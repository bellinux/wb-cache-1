2500|$|The {{standard}} {{action in}} tort is negligence. [...] The {{tort of negligence}} provides a cause of action leading to damages, or to relief, in each case designed to protect legal rights, including those of personal safety, property, and, in some cases, intangible economic interests or noneconomic interests such as the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress in the United States. Negligence actions include claims coming primarily from car accidents and personal injury accidents of many kinds, including <b>clinical</b> <b>negligence,</b> worker's negligence and so forth. Product liability cases, such as those involving warranties, may also be considered negligence actions or, particularly in the United States, may apply regardless of negligence or intention through strict liability.|$|E

40|$|The {{findings}} of the recent independent review of the UK Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) 1, following substantial concerns raised {{by members of the}} public and health professionals found that the implementation of the LCP is often associated with poor care 1. The Neuberger Report highlighted the complexity of various ethical, safety, <b>clinical</b> practice and <b>negligence</b> issues associated with pathway usage and how, despite technological advances, diagnosing dying continues to be challenging. The UK Government’s decision to phase out the LCP as policy following these findings, has generated considerable debate both within and beyond the UK. However, another key issue raised by the Neuberger’s report is the issue of the palliative care community’s perceived willingness to readily adopt new clinical practices in the absence of evidence. It is this translational issue that this editorial explores...|$|R
