Forester Ernslaw One converted 520,000 NZ units into Assigned amount units {{and sold them}} to the Norwegian Government, in a landmark ground breaking deal brokered by leading New Zealand carbon broker, <b>Carbon</b> <b>Market</b> Solutions Ltd. At the time, {{it was the largest}} forestry carbon credit deal in the world. Industry sources estimated the prices were approximately $NZ21 to $NZ22 a tonne and that value of the trade would have been between $NZ10.9 million and $NZ11.4 million, depending on the exchange rate. Ernslaw One had also sold 50,000 units at $NZ20 (sales value about $NZ1 million worth) to a NZ buyer and then subsequently at the end of 2009 made a second 500,000 tonne trade with the Norwegian Government.|$|E
25|$|The global <b>carbon</b> <b>market</b> is {{dominated}} by the European Union, where companies that emit greenhouse gases are required to cut their emissions or buy pollution allowances or carbon credits from the market, under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Europe, which has seen volatile carbon prices due to fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand, will continue to dominate the global <b>carbon</b> <b>market</b> for another few years, as the U.S. and China—the world's top polluters—have yet to establish mandatory emission-reduction policies.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} of IGCC is the biggest {{obstacle}} to its integration in the power market; however, most energy executives recognize that carbon regulation is coming soon. Bills requiring carbon reduction are being proposed again both the House and the Senate, and with the Democratic majority {{it seems likely that}} with the next President there will be a greater push for carbon regulation. The Supreme Court decision requiring the EPA to regulate carbon (Commonwealth of Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al.) also speaks to the likelihood of future carbon regulations coming sooner, rather than later. With carbon capture, the cost of electricity from an IGCC plant would increase approximately 33%. For a natural gas CC, the increase is approximately 46%. For a pulverized coal plant, the increase is approximately 57%. This potential for less expensive carbon capture makes IGCC an attractive choice for keeping low cost coal an available fuel source in a carbon constrained world. However, the industry needs a lot more experience to reduce the risk premium. IGCC with CCS requires some sort of mandate, higher <b>carbon</b> <b>market</b> price, or regulatory framework to properly incentivize the industry.|$|E

In direct defiance of this international legal obligation, in March 2007, Baird indicated that he wanted Canadian companies to be banned, or at least severely restricted, from participating in the international <b>carbon</b> <b>market.</b> Several European countries had already set up a trading system to allow companies that reduce their emission levels below government targets to sell [...] "credits" [...] on an international market. Many industry leaders argued that Canada should adopt a similar policy. Then-opposition leader Stéphane Dion argued that participation will allow Canadian firms to make [...] "megatonnes of money". Baird however described some carbon markets as [...] "shaky," [...] and argued that trade should be restricted to within Canada, or perhaps within North America.

40|$|Just as {{the world}} must adapt to climate change, it must also adapt to <b>carbon</b> <b>markets.</b> While some {{industries}} see <b>carbon</b> <b>markets</b> as a threat, many conservationists see a major opportunity. This paper considers implications of <b>carbon</b> <b>markets</b> for natural resource management (NRM) in Australia. There are in fact a range of distinct, but overlapping <b>carbon</b> <b>markets.</b> These range from international compliance markets (the Kyoto Protocol flexibility mechanisms) through national compliance markets (such as Australia’s proposed emissions trading scheme) to unregulated voluntary markets. While NRM is intimately linked to the global carbon cycle, {{it has a very}} limited role in existing and proposed <b>carbon</b> <b>markets.</b> The only significant direct impact likely up to 2015 is a small increase in tree planting. While trees have excellent potential to sequester carbon, the incentives for tree planting will be relatively small, given the limited scope of Australia’ proposed emissions reductions and the ability to import carbon credits from international markets. NRM managers should continue to manage carbon as one of a suite of issues without expecting rivers of gold to flow from <b>carbon</b> <b>markets.</b> Some may choose to participate directly in <b>carbon</b> <b>markets,</b> although this is inherently risky given their ill-defined and rapidly evolving nature. There is a need to develop improved understanding of carbon stocks and flows in the landscape, at both national and local scales. New institutions will be needed to secure carbon opportunities from agriculture and land management while also recognising other social and environmental objectives. carbon trading, emissions trading, environment, agriculture...|$|R

5000|$|As {{outlined}} previously, hybrid {{institutions are}} becoming more prominent amid moves away from traditional government towards modes of governance more appropriate for complex issues. For instance, {{a great deal of}} political faith is being placed on hybrid institutions for tackling climate change in the form of <b>carbon</b> <b>markets.</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>markets</b> are very much hybrid institutions in that they rely on governments to set the “rules for participation”, such as setting the cap or baseline, monitoring, verification and, as seen in the recently announced Australian carbon tax, setting a minimum price for carbon. Only once <b>carbon</b> <b>markets</b> have been “crafted” [...] by political decisions does the market aspect enter into play.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{progress}} of carbon trading in China and examines {{the involvement of the}} state and financial sectors. China witnessed proliferation of domestic <b>carbon</b> <b>markets</b> before attempting to institutionalize the carbon trading regime. Direct and strong government intervention is a key feature of this process. The domestic <b>carbon</b> <b>markets</b> are primarily created, shaped, and operated by the central and local governments supported by a cohort of macro-economic planners, local economic agencies, state-owned financial institutions, and business organizations with government backing. Key market players are institutionally dependent on the state - much more so than in capitalist economies. Private investments have not been adequately and effectively mobilized due to unfavorable economic, regulatory, and policy conditions. Non-state financial actors are not an active and influential player. This indicates a hierarchical relationship between the state and finance and a clear asymmetry of power in the organization of Chinas <b>carbon</b> <b>markets.</b> These observations constitute a notable difference to the international <b>carbon</b> <b>markets,</b> which are subject to the strong influence of private finance. China has put the market-based policy instrument of carbon trading under a substantial concentration of state power. The findings have important implications for understanding the rise of <b>carbon</b> <b>markets</b> in non-traditional capitalist economies. © 2013 Taylor & Francis. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
