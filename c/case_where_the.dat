5|$|The {{break-up}} {{velocity of}} a star is an expression {{that is used to}} describe the <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> centrifugal force at the equator is equal to the gravitational force. For a star to be stable the rotational velocity must be below this value.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence}} is related to Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral sequence) in the <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E
5|$|In Fig. 1, a body {{is moving}} along a {{specific}} curve MN acted on by a (centripetal) force, towards the fixed point S. The force depends {{only of the}} distance of the point from S. The aim of this proposition is to determine how the force varies with the radius, SP. The method applies equally to the <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> force is centrifugal.|$|E

5|$|In {{the more}} general <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> firm cannot price {{discriminate}} between domestic and foreign consumers {{the effects of a}} subsidy are less clear since both an expansion of exports and deterioration of terms of trade are present. However, Brender and Spencer show that starting out from the position of no subsidy, introducing a small subsidy can improve a country's welfare.|$|E
5|$|Noisy {{binary search}} {{algorithms}} solve the <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> algorithm cannot reliably compare {{elements of the}} array. For each pair of elements, {{there is a certain}} probability that the algorithm makes the wrong comparison. Noisy binary search can find the correct position of the target with a given probability that controls the reliability of the yielded position. The noisy binary search problem can be considered as a case of the Rényi-Ulam game, which Alfréd Rényi introduced in 1961.|$|E

In a twist of fate, both players were replaced by Mohammad Sami and Yasir Arafat on 1 March due to knee and elbow injuries respectively.|$|E

5|$|The Kačić's {{family can}} be traced to the Pacta conventa, an {{agreement}} dating from 1102 (or later), according to which the Kačićs were one of the twelve Croatian noble tribes (genus) who accepted the Hungarian king Coloman as the new king of Croatia. They were represented by comes Juraj Kačić (Comittem Gurram de genere Chaçittorum). According to the Supetar Cartulary, they were one of six tribes which selected bans who, in turn, elected a new king in a <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> prior king died without leaving heirs.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully takes a vacation to Maine, where she encounters a bizarre <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> victims appear to have inflicted wounds upon themselves—apparently {{at the behest of}} a strange young girl.|$|E
5|$|With feed-in tariffs, the {{financial}} burden falls upon the consumer. They reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced {{over a long period}} of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> diver is {{successfully}} recompressed {{within the}} nominal interval, {{he will be}} decompressed according to the schedule in the air decompression tables for surface decompression, preferably on oxygen, which is used from 50fsw (15msw), a partial pressure of 2.5 bar. The duration of the 50fsw stop is 15 minutes for the Revision 6 tables. The chamber is then decompressed to 40fsw (12msw) for {{the next stage of}} up to 4 periods on oxygen. A stop may also be done at 30fsw (9msw), for further periods on oxygen according to the schedule. Air breaks of 5 minutes are taken {{at the end of each}} 30 minutes of oxygen breathing.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{developing}} a non-perturbative formulation of string theory {{was one of the}} original motivations for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence. As explained above, the correspondence provides several examples of quantum field theories which are equivalent to string theory on anti-de Sitter space. One can alternatively view this correspondence as providing a definition of string theory in the special <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> gravitational field is asymptotically anti-de Sitter (that is, when the gravitational field resembles that of anti-de Sitter space at spatial infinity). Physically interesting quantities in string theory are defined in terms of quantities in the dual quantum field theory.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett, Reyes, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Scully stumble on to a bizarre murder <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> main suspect {{is a man with}} an unusual obsession for The Brady Bunch. Despite their initial differences—both in investigative style and love of The Brady Bunch—the four of them soon learn that the man's telekinetic ability is the ultimate, undeniable proof of an X-File.|$|E
