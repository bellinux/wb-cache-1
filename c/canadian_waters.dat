5|$|Alex {{marked the}} fifth-latest start to a {{hurricane}} season since 1954. The latest start to a hurricane season since 1954 was Hurricane Anita of the 1977 season, forming on August 29. Alex {{is only the}} second hurricane on record to have reached Category3 strength north of 38°N latitude. The other storm was Hurricane Ellen in the 1973 Atlantic hurricane season; Alex was the stronger of the two. It is also one of only five hurricanes to be at major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) status within <b>Canadian</b> <b>waters</b> since 1950.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in <b>Canadian</b> <b>waters,</b> Curtis became friends with Governor Molyneux Shuldham who became Curtis' patron and in 1775 {{assisted}} his transfer into HMS Chatham off New York City. The following year, with the American Revolutionary War underway, Curtis was promoted to commander and given the sloop HMS Senegal. Curtis performed well in his new command {{and a year later}} was again promoted after being noticed by Lord Howe. Howe made Curtis captain of his own flagship HMS Eagle, and the men became close friends.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ella was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} on record in <b>Canadian</b> <b>waters.</b> It formed on August30, 1978 {{to the south of}} Bermuda, and quickly intensified as it tracked west-northwestward. By September1, Ella reached winds of 125mph (205km/h), and it was expected to pass close to the Outer Banks of North Carolina during the busy Labor Day Weekend. The hurricane became stationary for about 24hours, and later turned to the northeast away from the coast. On September4, Ella reached Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale off the coast of Nova Scotia. It subsequently weakened, passing southeast of Newfoundland before being absorbed by a large extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|His {{time in the}} Senate allowed Blaine {{to develop}} his foreign policy ideas. He {{advocated}} expansion of the American navy and merchant marine, which had been in decline since the Civil War. Blaine also bitterly opposed {{the results of the}} arbitration with Great Britain over American fishermen’s right to fish in <b>Canadian</b> <b>waters,</b> which resulted in a $5.5 million award to Britain. Blaine’s Anglophobia combined with his support of high tariffs. He had initially opposed a reciprocity treaty with Canada that would have reduced tariffs between the two nations, {{but by the end of}} his time in the Senate, he had changed his mind, believing that Americans had more to gain by increasing exports than they would lose by the risk of cheap imports.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{with the}} United Kingdom were tense, as American {{fishermen}} felt menaced by the British navy's increasing enforcement of <b>Canadian</b> <b>waters.</b> Marcy completed a trade reciprocity agreement with British minister to Washington, John Crampton, which {{would reduce the}} need for aggressive coastline enforcement. Buchanan was sent as minister to London to pressure the British government, which was slow to support a new treaty. A favorable reciprocity treaty was ratified in August 1854, which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada. While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canada–US border, U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America, where the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850 had failed to keep Great Britain from expanding its influence. Gaining the advantage over Britain in the region was a key part of Pierce's expansionist goals.|$|E
5|$|On September3, another trough {{exited the}} coast of the United States, {{allowing}} the hurricane to accelerate toward the northeast through the diminished ridge. By that time, the winds had decreased to 80mph (130km/h), although forecasters expected baroclinic instability to maintain much of the cyclone's remaining force. Instead of continued weakening, the hurricane began to significantly re-intensify. Early on September4, Ella again reached major hurricane status, and later that day it peaked with winds of 140mph (220km/h); {{at the time it was}} about 335miles (540km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and its peak winds were measured by Hurricane Hunters. This made it the strongest hurricane ever recorded in <b>Canadian</b> <b>waters.</b> Weakening began immediately after peak intensity due to cooler water temperatures. Early on September5, Ella passed very near Cape Race, although the strongest winds were south and east of the center. Associated convection became completely removed from the center, and the hurricane became extratropical as it was absorbed by a larger mid-latitude system.|$|E

5|$|Decoy {{assisted}} in the evacuations from Greece and Crete in April–May 1941. She began escorting supply convoys in June to Tobruk, Libya until the ship was badly damaged in a collision in November. Repairs were not completed until February 1942 and Decoy {{was transferred to the}} Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean the following month. She remained there until September when she was ordered to return to Britain. The ship was refitted as an escort destroyer from November to April 1943 and transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy that same month as HMCS Kootenay. The ship was assigned to convoy escort duties in the mid-Atlantic for the rest of 1943 and early 1944. Kootenay was transferred back to British coastal waters in May to protect the build up for Operation Overlord. Together with other ships, she sank three German submarines between July and September. The ship was given a lengthy refit in Canada from October to February 1945 and returned to the English Channel in April to protect against any last-gasp efforts by the Kriegsmarine to interfere with Allied supply lines to the Continent. After {{the end of the war}} in May, Kootenay served as a troop transport in <b>Canadian</b> <b>waters.</b> She was placed in reserve in October and broken up in 1946.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, {{a treaty}} to combat illegal fishing in <b>Canadian</b> <b>waters</b> between Canada and the United States was {{rejected}} by the US Senate. Prime Minister Sir Charles Tupper then sought British Royal Navy aid in patrolling Canadian fisheries, but his request was rejected. The Canadian government then ordered the construction of three new armed patrol vessels. Petrel was constructed by Polson Iron Works Limited at their shipyard in Owen Sound, Ontario. The vessel entered service in 1892 patrolling the Great Lakes. Petrel was given directives to target illegal fishing by Americans in <b>Canadian</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|E
