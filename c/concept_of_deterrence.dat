In particular, the ideology and theory <b>of</b> <b>deterrence,</b> legitimacy, and international criminal law are drawn from. After all, the deterrent effect has been touted as a solid empirical fact with the progression and development of 2 ̆ 7 international criminal justice 2 ̆ 7, the international tribunals since the mid 1990 s, and the International Criminal Court. Yet, the current rather blind belief in the deterrent impact of international criminal justice remains, regretfully, a bit premature. Additionally, beyond the <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterrence</b> and legitimacy, criminologists have much to contribute to international criminal justice. As noted, there are social, political, cultural, and geographical issues that play a role in not only crime commission, but in the hindrance of and/or facilitation <b>of</b> <b>deterrence.</b> Criminologists are well positioned to show how these connections may facilitate or hinder the broader goals of the legal community...|$|R
50|$|The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterrence</b> can {{be defined}} as the use of threats by one party to {{convince}} another party to refrain from initiating some course of action. A threat serves as a deterrent {{to the extent that it}} convinces its target not to carry out the intended action because of the costs and losses that target would incur. In international security, a policy of deterrence generally refers to threats of military retaliation directed by the leaders of one state to the leaders of another in an attempt to prevent the other state from resorting to the threat of use of military force in pursuit of its foreign policy goals.|$|E

After a meeting with French counterparts in 1960 he came to espouse a very different policy, one based purely on nuclear deterrence with the stated position that the US would use nuclear arms at the first instance of hostilities of any sort. He felt that anything short of this seriously eroded the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterrence</b> and might lead to situations where one side might enter hostilities believing it could remain non-nuclear.

[...] Schelling believes that deterrence does not present [...] "a comprehensive picture of coercion, leading Schelling to introduce the concept of compellence".|$|E

The U.S. policy on post-Cold War deterrence was outlined in 1995 in a document called [...] "Essentials of Post-Cold War Deterrence". This document explains that while relations with Russia continue to follow the traditional characteristics of Mutual Nuclear Deterrence, due to both nations continuing MAD, U.S. policy of deterrence towards nations with minor nuclear capabilities should ensure through threats of immense retaliation (or even preemptive action) that they do not threaten the United States, its interests, or allies. The document explains that such threats must also be used to ensure that nations without nuclear technology refrain from developing nuclear weapons and that a universal ban precludes any nation from maintaining chemical or biological weapons.

40|$|Laws are {{of little}} {{practical}} importance if people ignore them, therefore public compliance {{is central to}} the effectiveness of a law. An enforcing authority wishing to promote compliance must understand why people obey or disobey the law. Two contrasting theories have been suggested to answer this question-instrumental and normative. The instrumental perspective underlies deterrent theory, it suggests that compliant behaviour is influenced by tangible, immediate incentives and penalties which are used by the individual to judge personal gains and losses. The normative perspective, in contrast, is concerned with the influence of what people regard as just and moral and their individual attitude of why they should voluntarily follow legal rules. Health and Safety legislation within the construction industry adopts an instrumental perspective by imposing strict duties on all parties to a project with the threat of punishment for non-compliance. This paper discusses various instrumental, normative and also social control mechanisms which can be used to obtain compliance. It is recommended that the way forward is to integrate the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>deterrence</b> with normative controls such as legitimacy, morals, justice and fairness, and to include a variety of social control factors in order to achieve maximum compliance levels...|$|E

There was no effete analysis. He had the capability and demonstrated will and he was thoroughly prepared for deterrence to fail.

40|$|Purpose This study {{applies the}} <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> {{restrictive}} <b>deterrence</b> {{to a sample}} of drug market offenders. In particular, we assess the influence of behavioral changes post-arrest on time to rearrest. Methods The sample consists of arrest data on all drug offences in South Australia from the start of 2000 to the end of 2007 (n =  26819). Cox proportional hazard models are used to conduct survival analyses. Supplementary models focus on those repeatedly arrested for cannabis cultivation to assess the influence of adjusting amounts of drugs on time to rearrest. Results Changing behaviors is related to more rapid rearrest. Switching offense location, drug seriousness, and charge seriousness are all risk factors. However, among offenders repeatedly arrested for cannabis cultivation, changing location and increasing the number of plants they grow is related to a longer period before rearrest. Conclusions Offenders that change their drug market behavior after being arrested appear to be placing themselves in situations in which {{they are more likely to}} fail due to the dangers of breaking into an unfamiliar market or offense pattern. Offenders with the longest post-arrest survival seem to be those that maintain their overall pattern of behavior while implementing subtle arrest avoidance techniques. ...|$|R

Such a policy could easily be {{construed}} as an example of almost automatic confidence in the US nuclear umbrella, yet only on the surface did extended deterrence appease Italian anxieties about the uncertainties of the American nuclear guarantee. The Italian rationale for accepting a large array of US nuclear weapon s did as a matter of fact involve a complex mix of reasons, ranging from trying to ensure that the Italian government would be consulted in the event of a major crisis, to willingness to enhance the country’s profile inside any Western multilateral fora. The paper will investigate this policy by looking at how the Italian government behaved at the height of the NATO nuclear sharing debate, between 1957 and 1962, arguably one of the historical moments in the Cold War when the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> extended <b>deterrence</b> was most intensely discussed.
