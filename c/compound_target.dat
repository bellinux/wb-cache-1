40|$|We have {{deposited}} Ti-Si-C {{thin films}} using high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS) from a Ti 3 SiC 2 <b>compound</b> <b>target.</b> The as-deposited films were composite materials with TiC {{as the main}} crystalline constituent. X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that they also contained amorphous SiC, and for films deposited on inclined substrates, crystalline Ti 5 Si 3 Cx. The film morphology was dense and flat, while films deposited with dc magnetron sputtering under comparable conditions were rough and porous. Due to {{the high degree of}} ionization of the sputtered species obtained in HIPIMS, it is possible to control the film composition, in particular the C content, by tuning the substrate inclination angle, the Ar process pressure, and the bias voltage.

40|$|We report two {{experiments}} {{investigating the}} effect of phonological priming on the recognition of two types of Chinese characters: compound targets which contain separate radical components; and integrated targets which do not contain separate radicals. We used a masked priming paradigm with varying prime-target exposure durations. In Experiment 1, phonological priming effects on <b>compound</b> <b>target</b> recognition were found following a 50 msec SOA. However, {{there was no evidence}} of phonological priming on integrated target recognition at this SOA. In Experiment 2 we investigated the time course of phonological priming effects at three prime-target SOAs (30, 50 and 80 msec) in a between-subjects design. Semantic priming effects were also investigated. Phonological priming effects on <b>compound</b> <b>target</b> recognition were found following the 50 msec and the 80 msec SOAs. However, {{there was no evidence of}} phonological priming on integrated target recognition at any SOA. Semantic priming effects on both compound and integrated target recognition were found in the 50 msec and the 80 msec SOA conditions suggesting that phonological and semantic activation are coincidental during compound character recognition. We conclude that character type constrains the activation of phonology during Chinese character recognition. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Amorphous (a) and {{nanocomposite}} Ti–Si–C coatings were deposited {{at rates}} up to 16 μm/h by direct current magnetron sputtering from a Ti 3 SiC 2 <b>compound</b> <b>target,</b> using an industrial pilot-plant system, onto high-speed steel, Si, and SiO 2 substrates {{as well as}} Ni-plated Cu cylinders, kept at a temperature of 200 or 270 °C. Electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analyses showed that TiC/a-C/a-SiC nanocomposites were formed consisting of textured TiC nanocrystallites (nc) embedded in a matrix of a-C and a-SiC. Elastic recoil detection analysis showed that coatings deposited at a target-to-substrate distance of 2 cm and an Ar pressure of 10 mTorr have a composition close {{to that of the}} Ti 3 SiC 2 <b>compound</b> <b>target,</b> as explained by ballistic transport of the species. Increased target-to-substrate distance from 2 cm to 8 cm resulted in a higher carbon-to-titanium ratio in the coatings than for the Ti 3 SiC 2 <b>compound</b> <b>target,</b> due to different gas-phase scattering properties between the sputtered species. The coating microstructure could be modified from nanocrystalline to predominantly amorphous by changing the pressure and target-to-substrate conditions to 4 mTorr and 2 cm, respectively. A decreased pressure from 10 mTorr to 4 or 2 mTorr at a target-to-substrate distance of 2 cm decreased the deposition rate up to a factor of ~ 7 as explained by resputtering and an increase in the plasma sheath thickness. The coatings exhibited electrical resistivity in the range 160 – 800 μΩ cm, contact resistance down to 0. 8 mΩ at a contact force of 40 N, and nanoindentation hardness in the range of 6 – 38 GPa.

40|$|Purpose: Deposition of hard thin {{multilayer}} coatings is {{a common}} practice in improving the performance of tools for many different applications. From this aspect Ti 3 SiC 2, due to its lamellar structure and unique combination of properties is a potential interlayer material candidate for thermo-mechanical application. Design/methodology/approach: Multiphase Ti–Si–C thin films were deposited by the ion beam assisted deposition (IBAD) technique from a single Ti 3 SiC 2 <b>compound</b> <b>target</b> on an AISI 316 L steel substrate. To optimize the deposition process, Monte Carlo simulations were performed; {{the range of the}} deposition parameters was determined and then experimentally verified. Scanning and transmission electron microscopies were used to examine the microstructure and quality of the deposited films. Mechanical properties were determined by nanoindentation tests. Findings: The deposited film was flat, smooth and dense with small crystalline particles. The hardness HIT of coated substrates was in the range 2. 7 to 5. 3 GPa. The average calculated value reduced elastic modulus EIT for coated substrates was 160 GPa. The hardness and reduced elastic modulus for uncoated substrates were HIT = 4. 4 GPa and EIT = 250 GPa, respectively. Practical implications: PVD techniques enable low substrate temperature deposition, preferred due to the thermal limitations of the metallic substrates commonly used in industrial applications. The aim of this work is low temperature deposition of Ti-Si-C film, from a single Ti 3 SiC 2 <b>compound</b> <b>target,</b> on 316 L steel substrate, using the IBAD technique, known for excellent film connection to the substrate.
