Among the symptoms presented, dizziness stands out, because of a probable toxic action. Aim: The goal of our study was to characterize vestibular test results from rural workers occupationally {{and environmental}}ly exposed to organophosphates used in agricultural pesticides. Materials and Methods: We carried out a cohort cross-sectional study with 18 rural workers from Teresópolis, RJ. Age ranged between 16 and 59 years, with a mean value of 39. 6 years, 5 were males and 13 females. We used three questionnaires with questions associated with general and auditory health, and more specific questions about dizziness and its association with work. All workers underwent <b>clinical</b> evaluation, <b>audiometry</b> and vectoelectronystagmography. Results: results showed that 16 workers had irritative peripheral body balance disorder and 7 workers had sensorineural hearing loss, thus suggesting that agricultural pesticides cause vestibular alterations through a slow and silent intoxication.

Previous research has shown poorer perception and restoration of interrupted speech in CI users and NH listeners tested with acoustic simulations of CIs. Three hypotheses were investigated: (1) training with CI simulations of interrupted sentences can teach listeners to use the high-level restoration mechanisms more effectively, (2) phonemic restoration benefit, an increase in intelligibility of interrupted sentences once its silent gaps are filled with noise, can be induced with training, and (3) perceptual learning of interrupted sentences can be reflected in <b>clinical</b> speech <b>audiometry.</b> To test these hypotheses, NH listeners were trained using periodically interrupted sentences, also spectrally degraded with a noiseband vocoder as CI simulation. Feedback was presented by displaying the sentence text and playing back both the intact and the interrupted CI simulation of the sentence. Training induced no phonemic restoration benefit, and learning was not transferred to speech audiometry measured with words. However, a significant improvement was observed in overall intelligibility of interrupted spectrally degraded sentences, with or without filler noise, suggesting possibly better use of restoration mechanisms {{as a result of}} training.

40|$|Objective: This study {{explores the}} {{influence}} of stimulation position on bone conduction (BC) hearing sensitivity with a BC transducer attached using a headband. Design: (1) The cochlear promontory motion was measured in cadaver heads using laser Doppler vibrometry while seven different positions around the pinna were stimulated using a bone anchored hearing aid transducer attached using a headband. (2) The BC hearing thresholds were measured in human subjects, with the bone vibrator Radioear B 71 attached to the same seven stimulation positions. Study sample: Three cadaver heads and twenty participants. Results: Stimulation on a position superior-anterior to the pinna generated the largest promontory motion and the lowest BC thresholds. Stimulations on the positions superior to the pinna, the mastoid, and posterior-inferior to the pinna showed similar magnitudes of promontory motion and similar levels of BC thresholds. Conclusion: Stimulations on the regions superior to the pinna, the mastoid, and posterior-inferior to the pinna provide stable BC transmission, and are insensitive to small changes of the stimulation position.

40|$|<b>Clinical</b> <b>audiometry</b> {{has long}} focused on {{determining}} the detection thresholds for pure tones, which depend on intact cochlear mechanics and hair cell function. Yet many listeners with normal hearing thresholds complain of communication difficulties, and the causes for such {{problems are not}} well understood. Here, we explore whether normal-hearing listeners exhibit such suprathreshold deficits, affecting the fidelity with which subcortical areas encode the temporal structure of clearly audible sound. Using an array of measures, we evaluated a cohort of young adults with thresholds in the normal range to assess both cochlear mechanical function and temporal coding of suprathreshold sounds. Listeners differed widely in both electrophysiological and behavioral measures of temporal coding fidelity. These measures correlated significantly with each other. Conversely, these differences were unrelated to the modest variation in otoacoustic emissions, cochlear tuning, or the residual differences in hearing threshold present in our cohort. Electroencephalography revealed that listeners with poor subcortical encoding had poor cortical sensitivity to changes in interaural time differences, which are critical for localizing sound sources and analyzing complex scenes. These listeners also performed poorly when asked to direct selective attention {{to one of two}} competing speech streams, a task that mimics the challenges of many everyday listening environments. Together with previous animal and computational models, our results suggest that hidden hearing deficits, likely originating {{at the level of the}} cochlear nerve, are part of “normal hearing. ...|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. This paper {{presents}} our operative {{method for}} hearing recovery after the previous radical tympanomastoidectomy, radical trepanation {{of the temporal}} bone (trepanatio radicalis ossis temporalis - TROT) in eight patients submitted to operations for giant cholesteatotoma. Methods. All the patients were admitted to our clinic after TROT. There were no signs of cholesteatoma or infection. The patients refused any stent implantations or any hearing aids due to possible aesthetic problems. The described procedure developed in two steps. The first one was to restore the destroyed cavum tympany and to covert with chondroperichondral new membrane with a pin-like “guide” as collumela. The second step was to insert a TORP (total ossicular replacement prosthesis) after guide excision. Results. After the first operation (stage one) there were no infections in the operated area nor chondroperichondral graft rejection. Postoperative audiometry (6 to 8 weeks) was done to demonstrate the improvement of air conduction. Three months following the first, the second (stage two) operation was performed and 2. 5 to 3 months after this operation even greater audiometry revealed hearing improvement in air- and bone-conduction. The patients were dismissed from the hospital 2 days after each procedure without any complications. They did not experience any dizziness, vomiting nor a severe pain. Three months after the second operative stage, otoscopic findings were very good. The audiometry findings after a 3 -months period (after stage one) and 3 months after final TORP insertion was done for each of the patients. After one year, the audiometric curve was the same. <b>Clinical</b> and <b>audiometry</b> follow up demonstrated a hearing recovery and closure of air bone gap (ABG) to values of 5 to 15 dB. Conclusion. The use of TORP after radical tympanomastoidectomy is feasible. The first step of the procedure is the fixation of a neomembrane. A stabilized neomembrane is essential for light overpressure on the prosthesis and this is important for optimal or better conductivity. A better hearing recovery is confirmed with audiometric findings and ABG reduction to 5 - 15 dB. This method could be performed in all patients (with good boneconduction) after radical tympanomastoidectomy for better hearing...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive {{procedures}} {{are a common}} method of investigating sensory abilities in research settings; however, their use in clinical settings is more limited. Little {{research has been done}} investigating the implementation of adaptive procedures into Audiological speech tests, and to date, no studies have compared and evaluated adaptive speech tests with current <b>clinical</b> speech <b>audiometry.</b> This study investigated the advantages of using both closed-set and openset adaptive speech tests in the clinical Audiology setting, with respect to administration time, accuracy, efficiency and reliability. Preliminary testing of the two major adaptive procedures (staircase and maximum-likelihood procedures) was conducted using a selection of different parameters chosen {{on the basis of the}} results of previous research (Kaernbach, 1991; García- Pérez, 1998) to determine the optimal procedures and parameters for use in clinical speech tests. Focus was given to the staircase procedures, with comparisons made between tests using variations in step size – constant step sizes and larger step sizes at the beginning – and different termination criteria. It was found that both adaptive closed-set staircase tests (with both step size variations) performed similarly, whereas the adaptive open-set staircase test with larger step sizes at the beginning showed advantages over the equivalent constant step size test in terms of administration time, accuracy and efficiency. The maximum-likelihood QUEST procedure showed advantages over the staircase procedures in terms of administration time; however, the reliability of both this test and conventional speech audiometry was poor, indicating that these tests are not the most suitable tests for a clinical setting. Subsequent clinical testing of the optimal adaptive speech tests using participants with varying degrees of hearing loss found that administration time was similar between conventional speech audiometry and the adaptive closed-set staircase tests when the optimal termination criteria identified in the Preliminary Testing Phase were employed. The adaptive open-set staircase test with larger step sizes at the beginning showed the best accuracy of any of the tests when using the pure-tone average as a reference, while the efficiency of all the adaptive staircase tests was similar. Overall, the results highlight some of the potential advantages of adaptive speech testing in the clinical Audiology setting; however, further studies are required to determine the specific parameters that achieve the best results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The first {{chiropractic}} adjustment {{given in}} 1895 {{was reported to}} have cured deafness. This study examined the effects of a single, initial chiropractic visit on the central nervous system by documenting <b>clinical</b> changes of <b>audiometry</b> in patients after chiropractic care. Case presentation Fifteen patients are presented (9 male, 6 female) {{with a mean age of}} 54. 3 (range 34 – 71). A Welch Allyn AudioScope 3 was used to screen frequencies of 1000, 2000, 4000 and 500 Hz respectively at three standard decibel levels 20 decibels (dB), 25 dB and 40 dB, respectively, before and immediately after the first chiropractic intervention. Several criteria were used to determine hearing impairment. Ventry & Weinstein criteria of missing one or more tones in either ear at 40 dB and Speech-frequency criteria of missing one or more tones in either ear at 25 dB. All patients were classified as hearing impaired though greater on the right. At 40 dB using the Ventry & Weinstein criteria, 6 had hearing restored, 7 improved and 2 had no change. At 25 dB using the Speech-frequency criteria, none were restored, 11 improved, 4 had no change and 3 missed a tone. Conclusion A percentage of patients presenting to the chiropractor have a mild to moderate hearing loss, most notably in the right ear.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the cochlear function {{of parents of}} individuals with autosomal recessive gene Gap Junction Protein Beta- 2 hearing loss by ultra-high frequencies distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), compared with responses of a control group matched for age and gender. Methods: We studied 56 subjects aged from 20 to 58 years, divided into two groups. The study group comprised 28 parents of hearing-impaired patients due to autosomal recessive inheritance, 14 females aged 20. 0 - 55. 0 years (mean 32. 8 years) and 14 males aged 20. 0 - 58. 0 years (mean 35. 2 years). Control group was composed of normal hearing individuals, 14 males and 14 females age-matched to the study group. The subjects underwent tests for audiometry, tympanometry, and DPOAE in the frequency range of 9. 000 - 16. 000 Hz. Results: We found 64. 3 % of normal results of DPOAE in the study group compared to 91. 1 % in the control. There were significant differences between groups in the ears and DPOAE responses, and the mean level of response was in 10 dBNPS in study group and 14 dBNPS in the control. The Pearson's correlation between age and DPOAE in ultra-high frequencies showed no statistical significance.

40|$|In {{terms of}} {{disability}} and handicap, problems in auditory function involve {{much more than}} a reduced sensitivity to soft sounds, the most commonly used measure of hearing impairment. In daily life, many hearing-impaired (HI) listeners suffer more from impaired processing of audible sounds, than from missing inaudible sounds. For example, people can have difficulties understanding speech in noisy situations or localizing sounds. The degree of these types of disabilities does not only depend on hearing thresholds, but also on other aspects of the auditory system such as loudness recruitment and spectral and temporal resolutions as well as non-auditory factors, such as cognition. All these aspects in hearing are widely investigated in research settings using many different, often time-consuming tests, but there are very few applications in clinical audiology. In <b>clinical</b> audiology, pure-tone <b>audiometry</b> is traditionally used and sometimes supplemented with speech audiometry for functional diagnostics, hearing aid fitting and counselling. As a result, many hearing aid fittings are based on audiogram data only, although modern hearing aids have a large number of fitting parameters that should ideally be set based on individual hearing capacities. The present thesis focuses on clinically applicable tests that could complement the pure-tone audiogram for functional diagnostics. The clinical usability and relevance of these tests for speech perception or broader auditory function is investigated. The end result is a battery of tests that could serve as a standard in extensive diagnostics or in audiological research: the (preliminary) Auditory Profile...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Grommets may be {{considered}} as the treatment of choice for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children born with a cleft. But the timing and precise indications to use them are not well established. The aim {{of the study is}} to compare the results of hearing and speech controls at three and six year-old in children born with total cleft or cleft palate in the presence or not of grommets. METHODS: This retrospective study concerns non syndromic children born between 1994 and 2006 and operated for a unilateral cleft lip palate (UCLP) or a cleft palate (CP) alone, by one surgeon with the same schedule of operations (Malek procedure). We compared the results of <b>clinical</b> observation, tympanometry, <b>audiometry</b> and nasometry at three and six year-old. The Borel-Maisonny classification was used to evaluate the velar insufficiency. None of the children had preventive grommets. The Fisher Exact Test was used for statistical analysis with p< 0. 05 considered as significant. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were analyzed in both groups. Abnormal hearing status was statistically more frequent in children with UCLP compared to children with CP, at three and six years (respectively, 80 - 64 %, p< 0. 03 and 78 - 60 %, p< 0. 02), with the use of grommets at six years in 43 % of cases in both groups. Improvement of hearing status between three and six year-old was present in 5 % of children with UCLP and 9 % with CP, without the use of grommets. CONCLUSION: The use of grommets between three and six year-old was not associated to any improvement of hearing status or speech results children with UCLP or with CP, with a low risk of tympanosclerosis. These results favor the use of grommets before the age of three, taking into account the risk of long term tympanosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: 290 236 persons {{bought a}} hunting license in Sweden 2014 / 15. Hunters are {{spread all over}} the country and come from all {{socioeconomic}} groups. Recreational fiearms can produce peak noise levels between 156 - 164 decibel sound pressure levels (dB SPL). Human challenge experiments in the past have demonstrated that a single gunshot can cause a severe temporary threshold shift (TTS). The recovery period after such acoustic trauma is unpredictable and a permanent threshold shift (PTS) cannot be excluded. Swedish and international surveys have shown a high usage of hearing protection at training but much less so at actual hunting. Although several studies have measured noise levels from diffrent types of weapons, there are only sparse observational data on dose-risk relationships and effctmodifying factors in humans engaged in real-life hunting. For continuous noise we know that diffrent factors, as tobacco use, affct the susceptibility to develop hearing impairment when exposed, but little is known of these factors when exposed to impulse noise as from hunting fie arms. Aims: To construct and validate an internet-based screening tool for testing hearing ability among large populations; To examine the association between high frequency hearing Impairment (HFHI) among Swedish hunters, and their shooting habits and usage of hearing protection; To examine potential risk modifiation of HFHI by tobacco-use when exposed to impulse noise from hunting rifl calibers. Materials and method: A secure website with a questionnaire and an internet-based audiometry test, the InternetAudio test, based on a JAVA platform, was constructed. The combination questionnaire and hearing test was tested for feasibility in a pilot study on 560 members of the Swedish Hunters’ Association (Study 1). The hearing test was validated using <b>clinical</b> pure-tone air-conducted <b>audiometry</b> as gold standard on 72 participants (79 % women) with a mean age of 45 years (range 19 - 71 years). Twenty participants had impaired hearing according to the gold standard test (Study 2). Finally in 2013 invitations to participate in the main survey was sent to 27 063 e-mail addresses retrieved from the Swedish hunters’ association membership roster. In all, 1937 persons started the survey, 1771 of them completed the questionnaire, and 202 also completed the InternetAudio test. In this fial survey the InternetAudio test was further validated while used under authentic conditions by 12 participants (Study 3). Associations, between the number of unprotected shooting with hunting rifl calibers (HRC) and HFHI, expressed as prevalence ratio (PR), were multivariately modelled using Poisson regression (Studies 3). In study 4 the possible effct modifiation of tobacco use in form om cigarettes/snus-use or both was examined with the same methods. Results and conclusions: In the pilot study 162 out of 560 (29 %) had answered the questionnaire, out of which 88 (16 %) had completed the hearing test. Those who completed the hearing test were older than the non-participants, and had to a larger extent headphones (p= 0. 003) and the correct version of the JAVA program (p= 0. 007) than those who only answered the questionnaire (Study 1). In the validation study of the Internet based hearing test the Pearson correlation coeffient was 0. 94 (p 6 unprotected gunshots with HRC. The adjusted PR of HFHI when reporting 1 - 6 unprotected gunshots with HRC, relative to 0, was 1. 5 [95 % (CI) 1. 1 - 2. 1; P = 0. 02]. We could not verify any excessive HFHI prevalence among 89 hunters reporting unprotected exposure to such gunshot noise > 6 times. In Study 4, current daily use of tobacco was reported by 61 hunters (19 cigarettes, 47 moist snuff and 5 both. Tobacco users tended to be younger, to fie more shots with HRC weapons, and to report more hunting days. Their adjusted PR (1 - 6 unprotected HRC shots versus 0) was 3. 2 (1. 4 - 6. 7), p < 0. 01. Among non-users of tobacco the corresponding PR was 1. 3 (0. 9 - 1. 8), p= 0. 18. P value for the interaction was 0. 01. The importance of ear protection could not be quantifid among hunters with HRC weapons because our data suggested that the HFHI outcome had led to changes in the use of such protection. Among hunters using weapons with less sound energy, however, no or sporadic use of hearing protection was linked to a 60 % higher prevalence of HFHI, relative to habitual use. Hearing ability can be accurately screened with a PC, an internet connection, and a pair of headphones among a willing population. The thesis results support the notion of a wide variation in individual susceptibility to impulse noise. Susceptible individuals may sustain long-lasting or possibly irreversible damage to the inner ear from just one or a few shots, furthermore Tobacco use modifis the association between exposure to unprotected impulse noise from HRC weapons and the probability of having HFHI among susceptible hunters. The mechanisms remain to be clarifid, but since the effct modifiation was apparent also among users of smokeless tobacco, combustion products may not be critical...|$|R
