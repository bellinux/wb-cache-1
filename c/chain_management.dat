40|$|The {{study on}} supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> {{has shown that}} the supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> is a {{particularly}} important and urgent issue in the industry. Especially in the electronics industry with its strong OEMs and weak suppliers the supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> should be a standardized method in a company and therefore needs to be taken into account. Companies increasingly recognize the importance of supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management,</b> due to globalization and the associated increasing distribution of value-added activities, as well as the expansion and the growing complexity of the supply chains. The study also shows that supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> must analyze and be based upon both strategic and operational risks. Another interesting finding of the study is that the quality of supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> decreases with a shrinking vertical range of manufacture, and also that the process quality along the supply chain is reduced {{on the way to the}} end consumer. This is an important discovery for the electronics industry, since the distribution of value added and the vertical range of manufacture among the supply chain partners is low in the electronics industry. It has to be said that future research about the topic of supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> should focus on broadly based case studies conducted in the European Union and the other economic areas for significant, transnational equation. The developed process model has to be mitigated to other industries and branches. Therefore, future research will be concentrated on the development of methods for a process model that can be used and implemented in any industry and industrial sector. The described process model was developed to help SMEs in the electronics industry to evaluate the criticality of their supply chains. The methodology and the process model provide a systematic procedure that supports companies to minimize risks, enables companies to enhance their performance thanks to more stable supply chains, increases the productivity of companies by reducing the supply-related waiting times, and supports companies to increase their competitiveness based on a stabilized supply chain. Supply <b>Chain</b> risk <b>management</b> will be a key success factor for companies in a globalized world if they have implemented a risk management process in their organizational structure...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The first {{purpose of}} the paper is to define the supply chain as a network through the Viable System Approach (VSA). Secondly, the paper aims to link the VSA to supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management,</b> {{assuming}} a network perspective. Design/methodology/approach - Anchored at literature review on VSA and supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management,</b> this paper presents a supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> framework for high tech sectors, including considerations on network measurements. Findings - This paper presents a network approach to supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> in high tech sectors, according to the VSA perspective. Assuming the network as unit of analysis means using the dyadic dimension as a tool and not longer as a termination. A proper methodological tool is presented and underpinned in the existing literature. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical nature of this study requires empirical research validation. The VSA perspective in reading the supply chain as a network is a step forward in the literature related to the System Theory. Researchers and companies can use the framework for supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> as a path to ensure a coherent risk management process along the supply chain. Practical implications - The network analysis {{is presented as a}} perspective to manipulate the supply chain network dimensions to ensure supply chain continuity. Originality/value - This paper expands the body of knowledge of the Viable System Approach to supply chains...|$|R

40|$|The new economy, {{also called}} {{knowledge}} economy, shifts radically {{the basis of}} competition and highlights the merger of firms; the cooperation, without eliminating the role of competition; the customized and flexible production systems.

40|$|Background: Supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> {{increasingly}} gains {{prominence in}} many international industries. In order to strengthen supply chain structures, processes, and networks, adequate potentials for risk management {{need to be}} built (focus on effective logistics) and to be utilized (focus on efficient logistics). Natural-based disasters, such as the case of Fukushima, illustrate how crucial risk management is. 	Method: By aligning a theoretical-conceptual framework with empirical-inductive findings, it may be hypothesized that logistical systems do {{have a positive effect}} on supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management</b> activities. 	 Result/conclusion:  Flexibility and capacity, as well as redundancy and standardization, are often viewed as being conflictionary. It shows, however, that in the light of supply <b>chain</b> risk <b>management,</b> those factors may yield a common benefit if proper logistics systems are applied. 	 ...|$|R
