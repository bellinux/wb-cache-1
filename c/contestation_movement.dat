40|$|In ideological terms, punk is a <b>contestation</b> <b>movement</b> in its artistic, {{economic}} and social dimensions. It resembled the 1960 s' garage rock since it favoured the public mobilization of youths through the proliferation of bands that campaigned for the do it yourself strategy. In Western societies, punk represented a departure from and a repositioning towards the existing social structure for which it also provided a soundtrack. It is {{in this context that}} we ap-proach the Portuguese punk, considering its importance in a society under recent processes of democratization and modernization. In fact, sociological theory must contribute to understand the set of social practices related to music in light of both the structural principles and properties of social life and the new emergent subjectivities, particularly among youths. Thus, in this article, we propose to look at punk from its protagonists' discourses. We will consider the words used by punk bands in two ways: their names and the words they use in their lyrics. In both cases, we deal with self-representation issues: who are we, how do we position and distinguish ourselves from others, what do we have to say about ourselves, our time and our world? What are our values and what do we have to say regarding dominant social values? What are the causes that move us, how do we want to act, how do we want the world to be like? As with any other self-representations, content is not independent from form. Therefore, mat-ters such as identification and actors (who speaks? who is he/she speaking to?) or language (how does the speaker express him/herself? Which codes does he/she resort to? Using which forms?) are also examined. Our analysis suggests that the punk discourse about identity tends to be structured around three main axes: (a) cosmopolitanism; (b) the radical assumption of an irreducible difference towards social order; and (c) an ambivalent attitude towards politics and political action...|$|E
40|$|The author {{contends that}} any <b>contestation</b> or countercultural <b>movement,</b> {{no matter how}} generous, is bound to failure unless it {{develops}} as a rational project. Violence, as such, might help visibility, but, in the last analysis, it amounts to nothing more than self-gratifying narcissism, incapable to produce positive results, even less to satisfy the request of present day youth for a different, more open society...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The World Social Forum is {{a global}} public arena of very {{heterogeneous}} social movements that despite their very different goals, agendas and languages, come together every year {{in a way that}} can be explained with Laclau and Mouffe’s notion of articulatory practice. The paper argues that with conflict and <b>contestation,</b> these <b>movements</b> construct an articulatory practice that is organized around the legitimacy crisis of neoliberal globalization. Because if, during the last decades of the twentieth century, neoliberalism, as a set of globalized polices, institutions and conceptualizations of the state, the market and democracy, appeared as an epochal common sense, today, this is no longer the case. Word Social Forum contributes to create a global political identity that speaks loud about the legitimacy crisis of neoliberal globalization. While discussing the struggle against the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the paper argues that the construction of regional and global public spheres is at stake in this emerging political identity...|$|R
40|$|Democratization is an ongoing, conflict-ridden process, {{resulting}} from <b>contestation</b> between social <b>movements</b> and political elites (Markoff 1996; Tilly 1984). The {{struggle to make}} elites more accountable to a larger public has produced the democratic institutions with which we are familiar, {{and it continues to}} shape and reconfigure these institutions. It also transforms the individuals and organizations involved in social change, generating social movement cultures, norms and practices that evolve over time. In this chapter, we conceptualize the World Social Forum (WSF) process {{as part of a larger}} historical struggle over people’s right to participate in decisions that affect their lives. We examine the democratic practices and norms developed in the US and European Social Forum processes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of the environmental movement in Spain, its organizational origins during the transition to democracy, its consolidation during the 1990 s and its configuration as a central actor in the country's current <b>contestation</b> panorama. The <b>movement's</b> specific pattern of evolution is interpreted {{as the result of the}} interplay between political context (political opportunities) and movement identity features. The main conclusion is that the movement has undergone a particular process of organizational consolidation which, contrary to the dominant view in social movement literature, has led to (increasing) political leverage, while maintaining essential features of participatory organizational models. The movement's influence on specific policy processes and its relevant organizational role in recent anti-globalization mobilizations are considered examples of this process of organizational consolidation and increasing political leverage...|$|R
40|$|Title page, {{table of}} {{contents}} and abstract only. The complete thesis in print form {{is available from the}} University of Adelaide Library. The thesis, 'Harriet Chandler', a study in (inter) textuality, is made up of the Major Creative Work and Critical Essay. The Major Creative Work is an imagined re-creation of Harriet Chandler, a minor character in Australian writer Murray Bail's 1987 novel Holden's Performance. The work of intertextuality includes both homage to the predecessor and the creation of something new. The thesis (re) considers Harriet Chandler's life before, during and after her contact with Holden Shadbolt, the eponymous (anti) hero of Bail's novel, with the aim of figuring and foregrounding the female and feminine, even the feminist, art work and cultural practice, conviviality and <b>contestation,</b> colour, <b>movement,</b> a becoming. Harriet Chandler represents mutability in her polio-stricken body, her art practice and her living at Manly Beach on the coastline of Sydney's harbour. The work is playful in its intertexual strategies and innovative in its hybrid writing practice. The tone varies from the comic to the serious; language varies from abstraction and the poetic to the ordinary and everyday; and genres and discourses include fiction, history, nature writing and auto/biography. The Critical Essay considers the coastline and the veranda as physical manifestations of in-between spaces, and innovative writing practice and intertextuality as textual strategies of the liminal which is characterised by the potential for change.

40|$|Most social {{movement}} research privileges {{the state as}} the main, if not the sole arena where social <b>movement</b> <b>contestation</b> takes place. By drawing from work in political sociology, international relations, and political economy of the world system, scholars can improve understandings of the ways political conflicts are embedded in extra-local contexts. This essay clarifies some assumptions embedded in state-centric approaches and explores ideas at the borders of {{social movement}} scholarship and related fields about how the world beyond states impacts conflicts on local, national, and global scales. Having engaged the interstate arena in unprecedented ways during the 1990 s, many activist groups saw more clearly this system’s limited capacities for responding to deepening global crises. The early twenty-first century thus saw a growth in transnational social movement activity outside the interstate arena. This encourages us to re-think relationships between social movements {{and not just the}} state, but also the interstate system itself...|$|R
40|$|The {{waves of}} protest ignited by the {{self-immolation}} of Muhammad Bouazizi in Tunisia in late 2010 highlighted {{for an international}} audience the importance of contentious politics in the Middle East and North Africa. John Chalcraft's ground-breaking account of popular protest emphasizes the revolutionary modern history of the entire region. Challenging top-down views of Middle Eastern politics, he looks at how commoners, subjects and citizens have long mobilised in defiance of authorities. Chalcraft takes examples {{from a wide variety}} of protest movements from Morocco to Iran. He forges a new narrative of change over time, creating a truly comparative framework rooted in the dynamics of hegemonic <b>contestation.</b> Beginning with <b>movements</b> under the Ottomans, which challenged corruption and oppression under the banners of religion, justice, rights and custom, this book goes on to discuss the impact of constitutional movements, armed struggles, nationalism and independence, revolution and Islamism. A work of unprecedented range and depth, this volume will be welcomed by undergraduates and graduates studying protest in the region and beyond...|$|R
40|$|The criminalization of {{violence}} against women over the past forty years represents both social movement success and the paradoxical alignment of feminism with increasingly punitive carceral policies. This historical analysis of the shifting social movement field during its formative years from 1973 to 1986 refutes dominant social movement paradigms for understanding social movement cooptation and demobilization. The research interrogates the processes and mechanisms of <b>contestation</b> between social <b>movement</b> and {{the criminal justice system}} and, more broadly, relationships between civil society and the state. A closer focus at the historical construction of the anti-domestic violence social movement field during this period reveals the ways that the very dynamics of contestatory success generate the conditions for an expanding carceral state, eventually resulting in blurred boundaries between civil society and the state and the domination of the field by criminal justice institutions and carceral political logics. Through the analysis of semi-structured interviews of 57 social movement actors, governmental policymakers and criminal justice personnel and the extensive analysis of archival materials, this historical case study of California and Minnesota, early innovators of hallmark social movement strategies and institutions pursuing criminalization, contributes to feminist, criminological and social movement scholarship regarding the dynamics of social movement field development over time...|$|R
40|$|For decades, {{immigration}} {{has been}} {{at the core of the}} political and social debate in Europe. In the post-crisis environment, recent events have inflamed the migration agenda further, as freedom of movement is an essential decision-making point in the planned referendum on European Union (EU) membership in the United Kingdom, and the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean is testing the limits of the EU and of its member states to manage migration in a humane and fair way. Large- scale immigration has long challenged the Westphalian tradition of nation-state sovereignty in Europe (Joppke, 1998). However, these tensions have only increased over the last decade, following conflicts in Europe’s neighbourhood, the fall of the ‘Iron Curtain’ and the eastern enlargement of the EU, or the 2008 global economic and financial crisis. If until recently the most controversial aspect of immigration has been migrants and asylum-seekers from outside the EU and an invisibility of European migration and European migrants, in the last few years we observe that the very principle of migration from the other member states is challenged in a systematic manner for the first time since its proclamation in the Treaty of Rome (establishing the European Economic Community in 1958). The rebellion against the status quo on freedom of movement of people in the EU is led by Western European states. They are the almost exclusive receivers of EU migration, either from the other Western European states, or from the new member states in Central and Western Europe. This essay traces the transformation of EU migration over the last decade, following the most recent enlargements and the south–north migration which has re-emerged since the financial crisis, and examines the causes of an unprecedented <b>contestation</b> of free <b>movement</b> rights.

40|$|This thesis draws {{attention}} to the overlooked period of English avant-garde activity that arose in response to the Situationist International (SI, 1957 - 1972). I attempt to consolidate the continued literary, political and artistic relevance of the disparate manifestations of English Situationist practices, while reflecting more broadly on the Anglicisation of Continental avant-garde traditions. The thesis contributes also to the ongoing re-evaluation of the SI through its peripheral and international permutations. The thesis presents an historical narrative in four stages. The first follows the formation of the Surrealist Group in England and its transformation into Mass- Observation. This activity in the Thirties is both prolepsis to and prehistory of the English Situationist tradition, which begins at the thesis’s second stage, in the early Sixties, with the novelist and cultural organiser Alexander Trocchi, one of the first British members of the SI. The third stage introduces the short-lived English Section of the SI and its immediate precursor and successor groups of the late Sixties, all of whom undertook a cultural translation of the SI’s project. The thesis’s final stage identifies contemporary manifestations of what I argue is an English Situationist poetics, which exists independently of self-identifying avant-garde groups. Interwoven through my historical narrative are investigations of three recurring problems: the problem of ‘Englishness’, and its perceived incompatibility with Continental avant-gardism; the problem of influence, whereby neo-avantgardism is dismissed as the hollow repetition of early twentieth century formations; and the Situationist problem of the radical aesthetic object’s subsumption to a commodity economy. I offer readings of novels, films and visual materials; of tracts, manifestos and journal debates; and of theorists (especially Rancière) whose perspectives on history and political aesthetics are productively dissonant with those of the SI. Anglicised Situationist practices, I propose, are valuable precisely for their <b>contestation</b> of and <b>movement</b> through Situationist theory...|$|R
40|$|This thesis asks {{why some}} ethnic insurgencies in Myanmar have de-escalated since 2011, while others re-escalated concurrently. It investigates this puzzle by zooming into the country’s most {{important}} ethnic armies: the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO). Findings from {{nine months of}} ethnographically-informed field research in the Kachin and Karen borderlands reveal that internal <b>contestations</b> within both <b>movements</b> have driven their respective conflict and negotiation strategies with the state. These intramural conflicts were sparked {{in the context of}} changing political economies in the country’s borderlands that enabled the enrichment of individual rebel leaders but eroded their authority within their movements. The original contribution of this thesis is two-fold: Theoretically, the thesis contributes to the emerging literature on the internal dimensions of rebel groups by moving away from the prevalent focus on rebel elites and rationaldecision making. Instead, it conceptualises insurgency as a social process between differently situated elite and non-elite actors, grounding itself within relational sociology. This appreciates how social dynamics - including figurational interdependencies, reciprocal power relations, and embodied practices - develop a momentum of their own in driving political violence. In doing so, it is suggested that the emergence and erosion of leadership authority in rebel groups depends on whether elites address their grassroots’ claim to recognition, enabling the latter to develop and maintain self-perceived positive social identities through affiliation to the insurgent collective. Empirically, the thesis contributes {{to a better understanding of}} one of the world’s longest ongoing but least researched civil wars by presenting original findings on its most important rebel groups, particularly with regards to the often uneasy relations between rebel elites and their grassroots and the ways in which internal contestation drives their strategies. Its findings also have implications for policy in so far as they highlight the pitfalls of counterinsurgency and peacebuilding approaches that aim at fragmenting rebel movements and/or privilege the material interests of elites over issues surrounding recognition and identity that – as this thesis shows – are underpinning ethnonational insurgencies...|$|R
40|$|The 1990 s {{marked a}} {{dramatic}} shift throughout Latin America from constitutions and state policies that hinged on ideas of colorblindness and mestizaje to targeted policies for black and indigenous peoples. This study analyzes the role black social movements played in {{this shift in}} Colombia and Brazil, two countries where the state adopted the most comprehensive reforms for black populations in the region. It also analyzes the impact of achieving such reforms on black movements' trajectories in the two countries. In so doing, I not only examine how black movements are shaped by the political {{context in which they}} emerge, but how they are able to reconfigure that political context in ways that ultimately reshape black movements themselves. Drawing on 18 months of fieldwork including in-depth interviews, archival analysis, and ethnographic methods, this study reveals new ways of understanding ethno-racial politics in these countries and offers insights about the relationship between movements and the state, as well as <b>contestation</b> within <b>movements.</b> Further, in examining how black movements seize upon changes in the global political field, appropriate global discourses into local struggles, and build transnational alliances, this work also challenges us to integrate the constant interplay between global and local processes into our analyses, especially when our aim is to understand social movement dynamics in the Global South. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, I show how the rise of global policy norms around multiculturalism, and the Durban World Conference against Racism, provided political openings for black movements in Colombia and Brazil, respectively. However, I maintain that it was the interplay between such global factors and national political developments paired with strategic action by black movements that best explains states' adoption of these historic reforms. Even so, while both countries adopted policies for black populations beginning in the 1990 s, the dominant discourse around black rights in Brazil centers on notions of "the right to equality" and inclusion, whereas black issues in Colombia are largely framed in terms of the "right to difference", culture, territory and autonomy. I suggest that these discursive differences have as much to do with how black populations were historically imagined by the state in the two cases, as they do with the different discursive tactics used by black movements when making demands on the state. The second part examines the consequences of the shift to ethno-racial legislation on internal black movement dynamics in the two countries. More specifically, I analyze the nature of formal structures of political participation set up for black populations in response to movement pressure. I do this by examining how movement actors negotiate, inhabit and contest such spaces, revealing a reality of social movement institutionalization that is much more complex than the literature suggests. Whereas black movements in Brazil have been absorbed into mainstream politics within a relatively democratic state, black movements in Colombia have either been repressed violently or institutionalized into precarious alternative political structures leading to unique internal movement dynamics. In order to understand the relationship between structure and agency as well as ntional and international political processes in these two cases, I propose the conceptual framework of national and global political fields which I argue contributes both to the literature on race in Latin America and social movements...|$|R
40|$|Why do {{revolutions}} happen? What role do structures, institutions, {{and actors}} play in precipitating (or preventing) them? Finally, What might compel social mobilization against a {{regime in the}} face of potentially insurmountable odds? These questions are all fundamentally about state-society (strategic) interactions, and elite and societal preference formation over time. The self-immolation of Muhammad Bouazizi in Sidi Bouzid on December 17, 2010, served as a focal point upon which over twenty years of corrupt, coercive authoritarian rule were focused into a single, unified challenge to the Ben Ali regime. The regime 2 ̆ 7 s brutality was publicized via social media activism and satellite television, precipitating mass mobilization across Tunisia and, eventually, throughout the region and beyond. In light of the rapid and unforeseen nature of these events, scholars writing about the causes of the Arab Spring have focused their critiques on scholarship that they felt overemphasized the role of institutions and elite-level actors over 2 ̆ 7 under the radar 2 ̆ 7 changes within society. This paper essentially agrees with this point of view, but is not content to simply 2 ̆ 7 throw out 2 ̆ 7 institutionalism. As Timur Kuran (1991) argued {{in the wake of the}} unforeseen collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, one cannot understand revolution without understanding the 2 ̆ 7 true 2 ̆ 7 preferences of social actors. In this way, the inevitability of revolutionary surprises seems a given so long as analysts continue to look from the top-down. Yet, this paper contends that institutions do still matter. They matter because different institutional arrangements incentivize and constrain regime strategies, which, in turn, inform the strategic calculations and preference orderings within society. These two societal variables are determined - in part - by the degree of regime flexibility, and they affect whether, how, and where social actors choose to vent their dissent. This paper proposes a model for the development of contentious social mobilization under authoritarianism. In order to do so, two models - one game-theoretic, and the other rooted in the contentious politics subfield of political sociology - are synthesized toward elucidating how altered societal preferences affect strategic interactions between the regime and society over time and during acute contentious episodes. The synthesized model is then illustrated through narrative case studies of two North African states that experienced divergent outcomes in the wake of the Arab Spring: Tunisia and Morocco. The limited spaces and institutions for the expression of dissent in Tunisia gradually changed societal preferences over time. In 2010, Tunisians 2 ̆ 7 preferences shifted from various socioeconomic demands and other issue-specific grievances toward a galvanized demand for the fall of the regime. In Morocco, on the other hand, social actors, by and large, continued to prefer limited reforms to a complete upheaval of the political system. This paper contends that this divergence in preferences and therefore outcomes was in part determined by the variation in the two regimes 2 ̆ 7 respective strategic mixes of concessions and/or coercion. To the extent that such strategies and institutions were more flexible - i. e. were more permissive of (limited) political contention and <b>contestation</b> - social <b>movements</b> were less likely to become emboldened against the regime...|$|R
