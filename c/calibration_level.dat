Standards 1 and 2 are mixtures of most amino acids occurring in plasma and were used throughout this work. Standard 1 contains 27 amino acids in 0.05  N HCl solution with a concentration of 200  µmol/L. Standard 2 contains only the three amino acids asparagine, glutamine and tryptophan in the same concentration. These are not stable in acidic solution. Calculation and calibration are based on an internal standard method with three different calibration levels. <b>Calibration</b> <b>level</b> 1 consists of 10  µL SD 1 and SD 2 plus 100  µL internal standard solution. <b>Calibration</b> <b>level</b> 2 consists of 50  µL SD 1 and SD 2 plus 100  µL internal standard solution and <b>calibration</b> <b>level</b> 3 contained 100  µL SD 1, SD 2 and internal standard.

40|$|International audienceDithiocarbamates (DTCs) are fungicides, {{which require}} a {{specific}} single residue {{method for detection}} and verification of compliance with maximum residue limits (MRLs) as established for fruits and vegetables in the EU. In this study, the use of ambient mass spectrometry was investigated for specific determination of individual DTCs (thiram, ziram) in fruits. Two complementary approaches have been investigated for their rapid analysis: (i) direct analysis in real time (DART) combined with medium-high resolution/accurate mass time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) and high-resolution/accurate mass orbitrapMS, and (ii) desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) combined with tandem-in-time mass spectrometry (MS 2). With both techniques, thiram deposited on a glass surface (DART) or Teflon (DESI) could be directly detected. With DART this was also possible for ziram. Before the instrumental analysis of fruit matrix, an extract had to be prepared following a straightforward procedure. The raw extracts were deposited on a slide (DESI), or rods were dipped into the extracts (DART), after which thiram and ziram could be rapidly detected (typically 10 samples in few minutes). In the case of thiram, the lowest <b>calibration</b> <b>levels</b> were 1 mg kg- 1 (DART-TOFMS, DESI- MS 2) and 0. 1 mg kg- 1 (DART-orbitrapMS).

40|$|One {{aspect of}} the recent {{paradigm}} shift in geospatial information sciences is that data acquisition and processing systems have {{moved away from the}} single sensor-based model to advanced integrated multisensory systems, which typically include imaging and navigation sensors. Active sensors, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IFSAR), are routinely used with conventional optical sensing where a new generation of high-performance digital camera systems have been developed in the past few years. The direct georeferencing of the remote sensing platform is usually provided by state-of-the-art navigation technology based on the Global Positioning System/Inertial Measurement Unit (GPS/IMU). As the number of sensors has increased, the error budget calculations for derived geospatial products has become more complex; the number of contributing terms has shown a multi-fold increase.

40|$|A CCD-camera based {{system for}} the retreival of {{bidirectional}} reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data has been evaluated for vicarious calibration applications. This evaluation is done by assessing the calibration requirements necessary to retrieve BRDF data {{for the improvement of}} the vicarious calibration approach, and then by examining the calibration problem itself. A sensitivity analysis shows that for a top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiance accurate to 0. 1 %, instrumental biases must be under 5 % while pixel-to-pixel gain variations may be as great as 10 %. A method for achieving the calibration requirements using a CCD-based BRDF camera system constructed by the Remote Sensing Group (RSG) at the University of Arizona Optical Sciences Center is presented. A relative <b>calibration</b> <b>level</b> of approximately 1 % across the camera array is found to be achievable given the laboratory facilities of the RSG.

40|$|PV module energy rating” is the {{calculation}} of the electrical energy that a photovoltaic (PV) module produces under realistic conditions. In this thesis, influences on the result—such as irradiance, temperature, spectrum and angle of incidence—and associated uncertainties were investigated. Special {{attention was paid to}} thin-film PV modules and the question as to what extent differences between module types are significant under consideration of uncertainty. First, the baseline for energy rating—STC power determination—was investigated. Comparable assessment of STC power by involved parties (manufacturers, laboratories, purchasers) throughout different continents is a prerequisite for the concept of energy rating to function. A measurement intercomparison between four international reference laboratories was organized to verify the consistency of international calibration levels, using three crystalline silicon (c-Si) and four thin-film PV modules. For the first time, the uncertainty values reported by each laboratory were included in the analysis. All results agreed within ± 1. 3 % (c-Si modules) and ± 3 % (thin-film modules), which is well within uncertainties. This showed first that the international <b>calibration</b> <b>level</b> is no systematic restriction for energy rating and second that the uncertainties indicated by the participating laboratories were realistic. The lowest quoted uncertainty values were 1. 6 % for c-Si, 1. 8 % for amorphous silicon (a-Si) and 2. 9 % for cadmium telluride (CdTe). They are based on an uncertainty analysis conducted as part of this thesis. Observed stability issues of the a-Si and the CdTe module could be fully explained for the first time by repeated measurements in the organizing laboratory. Second, the influence of realistic spectral irradiance on the energy produced by different PV technologies (“spectral impact”) was investigated. Spectral irradiance was measured and analyzed for a period of 3. 5 years at the location of Freiburg im Breisgau. The spectral impact was found to depend on the bandgap of the PV technology. A-Si with a large bandgap gained 3. 4 % compared to pyranometer-measured annual irradiation, whereas the small-bandgap chalcopyrite technology (CIGS) gained only 0. 6 %. The trend by months showed that the spectral conditions favor a-Si in summer, but small-bandgap CIGS in winter. In addition, the uncertainty of the spectral impact values was estimated. The obtained results were verified with a sensitivity analysis that covered calibration, angle-of-incidence effects and the use of different spectroradiometers. In summary, {{it was found that the}} uncertainty is in the same order of magnitude as the spectral impact itself. In the third and final step, the output energy and the “module performance ratio” (MPR) was calculated for a set of module characteristics and locations. These MPR values were compared to the MPR obtained for a reference data set (average c-Si module type). The MPR uncertainty was calculated using the uncertainties mentioned above and the additionally estimated uncertainty arising from measured temperature and low-light behavior of PV modules. The resulting uncertainty for MPR was 1. 8 % to 3. 0 % depending on the specific module characteristics and locations. Differences between the module types under scrutiny and the reference module type reached ± 8 % at maximum, which means that MPR of some module types significantly differed from the reference MPR. The difference from the reference for the c-Si module types under scrutiny was smaller than the associated uncertainty and thus not significant. The difference in nominal MPR between different module types was caused mostly by differences in their low-light behavior. The role of temperature influence and spectral impact depended on location. Limitations for energy rating are mainly the limited knowledge about specific degradation rates and the fact that MPR values calculated with different procedures are not yet sufficiently comparable in a quantitative way. The herein suggested comparative rating method presents an opportunity for using energy rating already today. In summary, the achieved results provide a comprehensive analysis of the influencing factors on energy rating for PV modules and their uncertainties, representing the so-far not existing baseline for further investigations and reduction of uncertainties in PV module energy rating...|$|E

FY- 2 C began to run operationally from March, 2005 until it was replaced by FY- 2 E on 25 November 2009. FY- 2 D and FY- 2 E are still operating on orbits and there will be more three members of FY- 2 satellite family in the near future, including FY- 2 F, FY- 2 G and FY- 2 H. FY- 2 spacecraft series has an on-board black body calibration mechanism, in which black bodies with known temperatures can be viewed. However, an absolute on-board calibration of the optical system is not possible, as part of the system consisting of the front optics is excluded from the calibration path. The current operational calibration of FY- 2 imager is mainly based on the inter-calibration using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and High-Resolution Infrared Radiometer Sounder (HIRS) onboard NOAA satellite. But this vicarious technique can not be conducted frequently and provide the diurnal variation when the instrument temperature has significant change in eclipse seasons. But the observation digital counts of the black bodies can respond directly to the diurnal variation of the ambient spacecraft temperature and sensor sensitivity. Black body calibrations may be used to tune the vicarious calibration. The latest FY- 2 E operational calibration began to be replaced using the Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS) results based on AIRS and IASI instead of AVHRR and HIRS on January 19, 2012. It shows the great improvement of this operational calibration based on GSICS correction. The new bias is only smaller than 0. 2 K and the deviation is smaller than 0. 1 K except for eclipse seasons. We can also use this kind of GSICS correction for the FY- 2 historical data for climate ultilization and provide an independent calibration coefficient. But GSICS cannot resolve all the calibration issues of FY- 2 imagers for every time because of its limited collocated radiance in each day, especially GSICS meets difficulty in the completely diurnal cycle in eclipse phase. GSICS can provide the radiance reference in insolated time for FY- 2 observation and it can be combined into the onboard blackbody model development. The black body observation of FY- 2 is supplying a stable relative calibration data of all infrared channels frequently. The black body calibration sequence starts with a space view (hence mainly observing the self-emission of the front optical system) being taken, followed by a view of the black body itself. The viewing of the black bodies is performed by moving a mirror into the nominal optical path of the radiometer, between the optical block and the front optics. Therefore, the front optics of the radiometer is not included into the optical path of the black body calibration mechanism. In addition the viewing geometry is not similar for black body and Earth view. Hence, the pure black body calibration coefficients cannot be used directly for calibration of the infra red channels. The front optics model correcting for these issues is derived under the help of GSICS reference radiance in full optic. the front optics are not part of the optical path during a black body observation, and as the viewing geometry is different when performing a black body observation with respect to nominal Earth observation, a correction model has been designed allowing for these effects. The black body calibration gives a stable relative calibration of the infra red channels, while the tuning towards the GSICS calibration gives the absolute <b>calibration</b> <b>level</b> for both channels. Hence, the GSICS calibration of both infrared channels is used to tune the black body calibration for guaranteeing the absolute accuracy of calibration...|$|E

Over the oceans, Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) is retrieved on a global basis with a spatio-temporal sampling appropriate for Ocean dynamics and Earth water cycle studies (Font 2010). The single payload onboard SMOS is the Microwave Imaging Radiometer using Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS), a novel fully-polarimetric L-band radiometer which estimates the brightness temperature by means of two-dimensional aperture synthesis interferometry. It consists of a Y-shaped set of 72 receivers (McMullan, 2008). More than 3 years after launch, the salinity product accuracy has still not reached the mission objective, even in the RFI-free open ocean domain. Main reasons are: 1) the challenging but intrinsically low sensitivity of L-band brightness temperature to sea surface, 2) the imperfection of the forward model used in the inversion procedure, 3) the spatio-temporal biases still present in the reconstructed brightness temperature. The present work is a contribution to adressing above-mentioned points 2 and 3. Several forward model deficiencies have been identified which propagate down to the retrieved salinity. If different studies have recently pointed out roughness dependent SSS errors and proposed updated formulations for the increment of emissivity due to surface roughness (Guimbard et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2012), the agreement in their results suggests that a robust improvement has been achieved. Nevertheless, another critical component of the forward model is the celestial signal scattered by the rough sea surface (Tenerelli 2008). The complexity of the biscattering problem and the large number of parameters involved makes highly difficult the procedure to improve its description empirically from real data. In spite of this, a recent work by J. Tenerelli has produced very promising results. The amplitude of the modeled signal near the specular direction is improved and better mimics the changes due to surface roughness variations. Nevertheless, there is still some discrepancy between parameters obtained when using different datasets, especially when using ascending or descending passes, and between different geometrical observation conditions i. e. incidence angle. Such inconsistency in the model parameters suggest an imperfection of the model physics. As mentioned in the introduction, latitudinal and seasonal biases are also affecting SMOS reconstructed TB ocean images (Tenerelli et al. 2010, Oliva et al. 2012) and retrieved salinity fields (Reul et al. 2012). Results suggest a correlation of the error with the sun illumination of the instrument through thermal effects, but attempts to cancel the corresponding biases at the <b>calibration</b> <b>level</b> are still not conclusive. In this work, it is assumed that such biases are essentially uniform across the field of view. A key point in this discussion is that celestial reflection model errors and thermal instrumental biases both vary at latitudinal and seasonal scales. In the current approach, forward model updates are contaminated by the imperfect instrumental biases estimates and vice versa. The present work is an attempt to uncouple these two important steps. First, for a specific data subset where the celestial reflection signal is expected to be time-invariant, the temporal biases are estimated, an empirical correction applicable to the brightness temperatures is derived and a corrected data subset obtained. Second, the corrected dataset is used to obtain celestial reflection residuals. Their inconsistency with the current galactic model, primarily in terms of incidence angle dependence is analyzed to derive a modification of the model. Finally, after evaluating its performance, the updated model is evaluated for a much larger dataset and the instrumental biases are now evaluated both at the temporal and orbital scales. For a given latitudinal band, i. e. orbital position, and a limited set of locations in the FOV, a specific geometrical configuration is identified for which the celestial contamination does not significantly vary along the year. A data selection strategy developed for the antenna frame systematic errors study (Gourrion et al., 2012) is refined to characterize the instrumental temporal biases in that particular latitudinal range. Assuming that the thermally-induced instrumental biases are homogenous across the FOV, celestial reflection residuals are derived {{from a wide range of}} FOV locations but the same orbital location. Their analysis points out an imperfection in the shape of the bistatic scattering coefficients used in the computation of the celestial signal as scattered by the rough sea surface. Both theoretically-based and empirical ad-hoc modifications are tested to propose a modification of the bistatic scattering functionPeer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For {{assessment}} of safety, {{it is necessary}} to measure the maximum possible force exerted by a bone conduction device coupled to the human head. Calibration of bone conduc-tion hearing aids and vibrators in the audiometric range is based on measurement of accelera-tion and force using an artificial mastoid. Extending the measurement to the high audio range was accomplished using a live head. To assess safety of the UltraQuiet tinnitus treatment sys-tem, as an example, acceleration was measured from 5 to 20 kHz on a live human head as com-pared with calibrated levels at 6 kHz on an artificial mastoid and the live head. Using head acceleration and anchoring it to established <b>calibration</b> <b>levels</b> is a means of establishing clini-cal safety. Stimulation in the high audio frequencies at low levels was found to be safe. In con-trast, stimulation with ultrasound requires more energy (approximately 75 - 90 dB re 6 kHz), which may increase the risk of damage to the ear.

However, correlation between trees in the same plot/stand has often been ignored in previous studies. Fitting and calibration of a variable-exponent stem taper function were conducted using data from 420 trees felled in even-aged maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) stands in NW Spain. In the fitting step, the tree level explained much more variability than the plot <b>level,</b> and therefore <b>calibration</b> at plot <b>level</b> was omitted. Several stem heights were evaluated for measurement of the additional diameter needed for <b>calibration</b> at tree <b>level.</b> <b>Calibration</b> with an additional diameter measured at between 40 and 60 % of total tree height showed the greatest improvement in volume and diameter predictions. If additional diameter measurement is not available, the fixed-effects model fitted by the ordinary least squares technique should be used. Finally, we also evaluated how the expansion of parameters with random effects affects the stem taper prediction, as we consider this a key question when applying the mixed-effects modelling approach to taper equations. The results showed that correlation between random effects {{should be taken into}} account when assessing the influence of random effects in stem taper prediction...|$|R
