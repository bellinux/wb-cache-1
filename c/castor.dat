5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} {{to belong to a}} stellar association called the <b>Castor</b> Moving Group. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, <b>Castor,</b> Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the group are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving group is , and they have an average space velocity of 16.5km/s.|$|E

5|$|<b>Castor</b> and Pollux– An elderly {{conjoined}} twin, they usurped the Oracle of Delphi {{and decided}} who could see her. When Kratos attempted {{to see the}} Oracle without any offerings, the twin made themselves younger by using the Amulet of Uroborus and then fought Kratos. They attempted to kill the Oracle so that Kratos could not see her. After crushing the Oracle under rocks, Kratos then killed the twin and took the amulet. <b>Castor</b> and Pollux were voiced by David W. Collins and Brad Grusnick, respectively, in Ascension.|$|E
5|$|Laforey {{immediately}} advanced on {{the strange}} sails, which were soon {{revealed to be}} <b>Castor</b> and the Dutch merchant ship. With Carysfort bearing down on him L'Huillier cast off the tow and prepared for battle, meeting the approaching British frigate with a broadside. The engagement was fought at close range and with little manoeuvering by either side, the ships exchanging broadsides {{for an hour and}} fifteen minutes before L'Huillier surrendered. His ship was heavily battered in the exchange, with the main topgallantmast knocked down and the mainmast and hull severely damaged. Carysfort suffered just one man killed and four wounded from the understrength crew of 180, while casualties were much heavier among the approximately 200 men aboard <b>Castor,</b> the French losing 16 men killed and nine wounded. The Dutch ship initially escaped, but was later captured and its value was eventually included in the prize money paid for <b>Castor.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day that Observateur arrived off Basse-Terre, the frigate HMS <b>Castor</b> under Captain William Roberts had recaptured the {{merchant}} brig Ariel near La Désirade, taken by Roquebert's squadron two weeks earlier. Roberts also discovered two other ships in the distance to the north and had closed to investigate, discovering the French convoy. Darkness fell soon afterwards and <b>Castor</b> separated from the French ships, as Roberts sailed westwards as fast as possible to notify Ballard of his sighting, arriving at 04:00 on 17 December. In the aftermath of the destruction of Junon and the encounter with <b>Castor,</b> Roquebert decided to separate from the convoy and return to France, turning north with Clorinde and leaving the supply ships to make the journey to Guadeloupe independently. As a result, Loire and Seine were sailing unprotected straight towards Ballard's squadron.|$|E

Pollux's pelvis is represented by the star δ Gem, Pollux's right knee by ζ Gem, Pollux's right foot by γ Gem, Pollux's left knee by λ Gem, and Pollux's left foot by ξ Gem. γ Gem is of the second magnitude, while δ and ξ Gem are of the third magnitude. <b>Castor's</b> torso is represented by the star τ Gem, <b>Castor's</b> left hand by ι Gem (which he shares with Pollux), <b>Castor's</b> right hand by θ Gem; all three of these stars are of the fourth magnitude. <b>Castor's</b> pelvis is represented by the star ε Gem, <b>Castor's</b> left foot by ν Gem, and <b>Castor's</b> right foot by μ Gem and η Gem; ε, μ, and η Gem are of the third magnitude.

5|$|The frigate {{action of}} 29 May 1794—not to be {{confused}} with the much larger fleet action of 29 May 1794 that took place in the same waters at the same time—was a minor naval engagement of the French Revolutionary Wars between a Royal Navy frigate and a French Navy frigate. The action formed a minor part of the Atlantic campaign of May 1794, a campaign which culminated in the battle of the Glorious First of June, and was unusual in that the French ship <b>Castor</b> had only been in French hands for a few days at the time of the engagement. <b>Castor</b> had previously been a British ship, seized on 19 May by a French battle squadron in the Bay of Biscay and converted to French service while still at sea. While the main fleets manoeuvered around one another, <b>Castor</b> was detached in pursuit of a Dutch merchant ship and on 29 May encountered the smaller independently cruising British frigate HMS Carysfort.|$|E

5|$|The {{narrative}} {{shifts to}} three weeks before Kratos' imprisonment. Confronted by Orkos in the Village of Kirra, Kratos is advised that the visions he has been experiencing are mind tricks created by the Furies, and instructs him to find the Oracle of Delphi. Upon arrival at the Temple of Delphi, he overcomes <b>Castor</b> and Pollux, who tried to kill the Oracle. In her dying breath, the Oracle instructs Kratos to travel to Delos to retrieve the Eyes of Truth. Taking the Amulet of Uroborus from the now-dead <b>Castor</b> and Pollux, Kratos travels to Kirra's harbor, where he again encounters Orkos. The oath keeper reveals that Ares wanted a perfect warrior to help him overthrow Zeus, so Ares helped Kratos against the barbarians to make him into a perfect warrior. Orkos became the oath keeper and did not question the Furies until Ares tricked Kratos into killing his own family. Armed with this knowledge, Kratos takes a ship to Delos.|$|E

5|$|When {{alerted to}} the {{possibility}} of Michael Farrar having been poisoned in the months before the fire, detectives investigated the origin of the <b>castor</b> beans that had led to police investigating the September domestic dispute. The label on the seed packets identified them as a product of the Earl May chain of stores. An officer found contact information for the Olathe, Kansas Earl May store in Green's address book. The detectives contacted nearby Earl May stores to find if any employees remembered selling <b>castor</b> beans, which are out of season in the fall. A clerk in Missouri recalled that in September a woman had ordered ten packets of the out-of-season seeds and explained that she needed them for schoolwork. The clerk gave a description of the buyer that corresponded to Green, and tentatively identified her in a photo line-up as the buyer. Register tapes in the store's records showed that a purchase price corresponding to ten packets of <b>castor</b> beans had been rung up on either September 20 or 22. No records were found in any Earl May store of earlier such purchases that would have corresponded to Farrar first having become ill earlier in the year.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{called by}} the State {{supported}} Farrar's and the prosecutors' earlier claims that police had been called to the home {{a month before the}} fire, that Green's behavior had been cause for concern at the time, and that Farrar had turned in to police at that time seed packets containing <b>castor</b> beans. The Earl May store clerk who had identified Green as the purchaser of multiple packets of <b>castor</b> bean seeds testified to that effect. Medical evidence was presented that Farrar's illness had not fit neatly within the parameters of any known disease, but that its presentation matched the symptoms of ricin poisoning. An FBI criminologist provided testimony that he had tested for ricin antibodies in Farrar's blood approximately two months after Farrar's last acute symptoms, and found antibodies there in such large amounts that he could confidently state that Farrar had been subjected to repeated exposures to ricin.|$|E
