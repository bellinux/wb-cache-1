The neurological complications found are meningoencephalitis, subdural effusion, cerebral hypoperfusion, cerebral ischemia and infarct, <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction,</b> manifesting with seizures, chorea, hemiplegia, mental confusion, lethargy and coma, or even a cerebral infarction with no neurological manifestations. Other neurological complications from cranial nerve involvement are reported as ataxia, facial palsy, and sensorineural hearing loss.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Strokes due {{to small}} (&#x 3 c; 2 cm) <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> are under-recognised, and their profile and {{aetiology}} {{have not been}} well characterised. We aimed to determine the frequency, clinical features, aetiology, and outcome of small as compared to large <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction.</b> Methods: This study is a retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging features of a prospectively assessed series of 108 consecutive patients with acute <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> admitted to Liverpool Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia, during 2011 – 2015. Results: The {{mean age of the}} patients was 67 years, and 33 (31 %) had small <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction.</b> Compared to large <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction,</b> those with small <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> had a comparable distribution of vascular risk factors but significantly less nausea and vomiting, gait disturbance, limb ataxia, and dysarthria. The posterior (n = 22, 67 %) lobe was most commonly affected, followed by the anterior (n = 9, 27 %) and flocculonodular (n = 2) lobes. Dizziness, limb ataxia, and nystagmus were significantly more common in patients with anterior lobe infarction. Vertebrobasilar disease was the presumed aetiology in 40 patients (37 %), and was less commonly seen in small as compared to large <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction.</b> Cardioembolism affected 37 % of the patients, irrespective of the size or topography of the <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction,</b> and there was no relation of supratentorial white matter lucencies (WMLs) to the size of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction.</b> At 3 months, 65 % of the patients were functionally independent (according to modified Rankin Scale scores of 0 – 2), and having a poor outcome was significantly related to moderate-to-severe supratentorial WML and large <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction.</b> Conclusions: Small <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> accounted for one-third of the ischaemic strokes in this location, most often involved the posterior lobe, causing fewer clinical features, and had a better clinical outcome than large <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction.</b> Patients with small <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> require appropriate vascular management including investigation for a cardioembolic source...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Systemic giant cell {{arteritis}} causing <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> due to intracranial arteritis of {{the anterior}} inferior cerebellar artery {{has not been}} previously reported. We report this infrequent occurrence and discuss the differential diagnosis. Case Description: An 85 -year-old woman was admitted with a 2 -week history of episodic ataxia, unilateral headaches, and vomiting. She {{had a history of}} atrial fibrillation and breast carcinoma. Her mental state was initially normal, and there were right-sided cerebellar signs. An ejection systolic murmur was heard, and peripheral pulses were palpable. A postmortem examination revealed <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> due to giant cell arteritis of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and basilar arteries. Systemic giant cell arteritis was also present. Conclusions: Giant cell arteritis is a systemic disorder that can infrequently involve intracranial vessels, including the basilar, vertebral, and anterior cerebellar arteries. <b>Cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> secondary to the arteritis may occur.

40|$|Background and Purposed: Vertigo and {{headache}} {{are common}} symptoms {{at the onset}} of <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction,</b> although many patients have few neurological deficits, and are misdiagnosed. In this study, we investigated the clinical characteristics in admitted patients with acute <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction.</b> Methods: Data from 33 consecutively admitted patients with acute <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> were analysed. We investigated the relationships between vascular lesions and clinical findings. Results: Eighty-eight percent of the patients had posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory lesions. Headache was significantly more frequent (60 %) in patients with PICA territory infarction than in those with superior cerebellar artery (SCA, 20 %) or anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA, 24 %, p = 0. 044). Dysarthria was significantly less frequent (36 %) in patients with PICA territory infarction than in those with SCA (57 %) or AICA (60 %, p = 0. 017). Eight out of 10 patients with bilateral <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> were categorized into a cardiogenic embolism. A total of 58 % were misdiagnosed on admission. All five patients with arterial dissection were not diagnosed. Only one patient misdiagnosed was evaluated by a neurologist. Forty-eight percent of patients had good clinical outcomes. Conclusions: Headache was frequent and dysarthria was infrequent in patients with PICA territory infarction. Bilateral lesions were frequent in patients with SCA and AICA territory infarctions. Almost all bilateral cerebellar infarctions were cardiogenic embolism. Many patients with acute <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> were misdiagnosed at first evaluation. <b>Cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> are likely to be misdiagnosed.

40|$|Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) is {{considered}} a very safe and effective procedure to treat painful compression fractures, and this procedure rarely results in complications. To our knowledge, {{there is only one}} case report of the complications associated with cerebral infarction after PV.

We present a rare case of left acute <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> that developed approximately 6 h after PV in an 82 -year-old woman. Brain magnetic resonance (MR) angiography showed complete occlusion of the left vertebral artery. The patient was treated conservatively. To the best of our knowledge, acute <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarction</b> after PV has yet not been reported. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of embolism because the patient was in the prone position with her head rotated during the operation, there are no specific links between acute arterial infarction and PV.

40|$|A 10 -year-old boy {{was hospitalized}} with {{post-traumatic}} nausea, vomiting, and ataxia. A cervical X-ray showed atlantoaxial dislocation with os odontoideum, and a {{computed tomography scan}} revealed multiple <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarctions.</b> Cerebral angiography disclosed right vertebral artery occlusion at the craniovertebraljunction and basilar artery occlusion distal to {{the origin of the}} anterior inferior cerebellar artery. An intra-arterial thrombus was predent in the left vertebral artery just above the transverse foramen of os axis. Sequential cerebral angiography showed persistent occlusion of the right vertebral and basilar arteries. However, within 1 month of the injury, the thrombus in the vertebral artery had disappeared and an aneurysmal dilatation had appeared at the same site. The patient underwent posterior fusion of the atlas and axis, and his recovery was uneventful. Aneurysmal dilatation disappeared spontaneously 4 months after the trauma. In this case, atlantoaxial dislocation might have caused the left vertebral artery thrombosis and resulted in the basilar artery occlusion.

Inpatient and intensive care hospitalization units managing children and adolescents. Subjects. Male adolescent patients with ischemic cer-ebellar stroke after use of marijuana. Diagnostic Investigations. Computed tomography brain scans (3 subjects), magnetic resonance imaging brain study (1 subject), cerebral arteriography (1 subject), cerebellar biopsy (1 subject), and necropsy (2 subjects). Results. Three adolescent males had similar presen-tations of headache, fluctuating level of consciousness or lethargy, visual disturbance, and variable ataxia after self-administration of marijuana.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic {{ruptured}} aneurysms of distal cerebellar arteries (DCAAs) are rare, {{and their}} endovascular therapy (EVT) has as yet not been extensively reported. They are usually assumed {{to result from}} local arterial wall disruption rather than infection, unlike distal supratentorial artery aneurysms. This study was performed to audit their frequency, potential aetiology and results of EVT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using strict inclusion criteria and a database of 1715 EVT patients, we identified ten idiopathic ruptured DCAAs (0. 6 %) over a 13 -year period (1993 - 2006). The series comprised six males and four females with mean age of 64 years and solitary aneurysms located on posterior inferior cerebellar artery (five patients), anterior inferior cerebellar artery (three patients) and superior cerebellar artery (two patients). Nine aneurysms were fusiform and were treated by endovascular parent artery occlusion, and one was saccular and treated by endosaccular packing. Endovascular therapy was performed with coils in seven cases, n-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate (NBCA) in two cases and with both in one case. RESULTS: Primary EVT was successful in eight patients. One patient died following a procedure-related re-bleeding and one patient required re-treatment after failed endosaccular packing. Nine patients made good or excellent clinical recoveries (modified Rankin Scale 2 or less). Focal <b>cerebellar</b> <b>infarctions</b> were seen on computed tomography images after EVT in three patients, only {{one of whom was}} symptomatic with transient dysmetria, which resolved completely during follow up. No aneurysm recanalisation was detected on late follow-up imaging up to 24 months. CONCLUSION: Ruptured DCAAs are rare. The majority are fusiform in shape and their aetiology remains uncertain. Endovascular treatment is feasible and effective. It usually requires parent artery occlusion...|$|R
