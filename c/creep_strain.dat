The {{fundamental}} principles {{involved in the}} selection and implementation of time integration schemes for finite element analysis of nonlinear creep problems are investigated. The relationship between {{the nature of the}} integration algorithms and the mechanical principles of the time-dependent problem is explored. The emphasis is on uniaxial creep and simple constitutive laws are adopted. The essential nature of the problem is presented in different formulations. The creep problem is contained in a system of nonlinear first order ordinary differential equations in the <b>creep</b> <b>strains</b> only. This suggests that the integration scheme should be applied to the <b>creep</b> <b>strains</b> whereas traditional methods approximate the stresses.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} {{at the design stage}} {{to predict the}} creep behaviour of components and structures operating at high temperature. The direct calculation of the creep behaviour requires extensive material data for the long service lives of the components and engineering methods are needed to minimise the amount of data needed. This can be achieved in some cases by use of the so called Reference stress method and the objective of this work was the experimental prediction of the creep deformation of some components using developments of this idea. It has been achieved by the determination of Reference stresses from accelerated room temperature creep tests of lead alloy models. Reference stresses, which characterise the creep response of components in relation to uniaxial tests, have previously been determined by calculation. Reference stresses determined by the new experimental methods have been compared with analytical predictions for beams in pure bending, cantilevers, thin cylinders and thin spheres under internal pressure. Acceptable agreement was found for the Reference stresses and consequent predictions of creep deformations. The method has also been used successfully to predict <b>creep</b> <b>strains</b> in a cylindrical pressure vessel with a hemispherical end. The methods of chill-casting models from a lead-antimony-arsenic alloy have been improved and the material has been calibrated by constant and stepped load, uniaxial and biaxial (combined pressure and torsion of thin cylinders) tests. The <b>creep</b> <b>strains</b> cannot be characterised by separate. stress and time functions; a strain hardening law best describes its stepped load response; the von-Mises criterion gives accurate predictions of <b>creep</b> <b>strains</b> in the tension-compression quadrant but underestimates the <b>creep</b> <b>strains</b> in the tension-tension quadrant...|$|R

50|$|With {{increasing}} turbine entry temperature, it {{is important}} to gain a fundamental understanding of the physical phenomena occurring during creep deformation of single crystal superalloys under such extreme condition (i.e. high temperature and high stress). The creep deformation behavior of superalloy single crystal is strongly temperature, stress, orientation and alloy dependent. For a single-crystal superalloy, there are 3 different mode of creep deformation under regimes of different temperature and stress: Rafting, Tertiary and Primary. At low temperature (~750 °C), SX alloys exhibits mostly primary creep behavior. Matan et al. concluded that the extent of primary creep deformation depends strongly on the angle between the tensile axis and the <001>/<011> symmetry boundary. At temperature above 850 °C, tertiary creep dominates and promotes strain softening behavior. When temperature exceeds 1000 °C, the rafting effect is prevalent where cubic particles transform into flat shapes under tensile stress The rafts would also form perpendicular to the tensile axis, since γ phase was transported out of the vertical channels and into the horizontal ones. After conducting unaxial creep deformation of <001> orientated CMSX-4 single crystal superalloy at 1105 °C and 100 MPa, Reed et al. has established that rafting is beneficial to creep life since it delays evolution of <b>creep</b> <b>strain.</b> In addition, rafting would occur quickly and suppress the accumulation of <b>creep</b> <b>strain</b> until a critical strain is reached.|$|E
5000|$|Nabarro-Herring creep is {{a mode of}} {{deformation}} of crystalline materials that occurs at low stresses and held at elevated temperatures in fine-grained materials. In Nabarro-Herring creep, atoms diffuse through the crystals, and the creep rate varies inversely with {{the square of the}} grain size so fine-grained materials creep faster than coarser-grained ones. [...] This type of creep results from the diffusion of vacancies from regions of high chemical potential at grain boundaries subjected to normal tensile stresses to regions of lower chemical potential where the average tensile stresses across the grain boundaries are zero. Self-diffusion within the grains of a polycrystalline solid can cause the solid to yield to an applied shearing stress, the yielding being caused by a diffusional flow of matter within each crystal grain away from boundaries where there is a normal pressure and toward those where there is a normal tension.

A number of well-documented full-scale tests on reinforced concrete columns exposed to Standard Fire (without cooling) was simulated numerically, by implementing four different constitutive models proposed in the literature for concrete at high temperature.
