40|$|Purpose: We {{examine the}} impact of advice given by {{extension}} agents to Ethiopian farmers, as perceived by the farmers themselves. Design/methodology/approach: Using survey data from 2014, we analyze the perceived impact of advice on farmers’ incomes and crop yields. We use a bootstrapped instrumental variable (IV) estimator and the conditional mixed process estimator. Theoretical implications: The impact of advice will depend upon its relevance and whether and how efficiently it is implemented by the farmer. This in part depends upon the farmer’s ability and on {{the impact of}} fully implemented advice on output, which will vary from farm to farm. Findings: There is a positive perceived impact of most advice on both crop yields and income. However, some advice works better in drought-affected areas and other in non-drought-affected areas. Fertilizers have more impact on crop yields than income, possibly reflecting cost factors. There is evidence that the farmers’ ability to implement the advice increases with their level of education and that advice is being tailored {{to the needs of the}} individual. Practical implications: Advice has a positive impact on both crop yields and income. However, not all advice is equally effective and effectiveness varies according to farmer and farm characteristics. There is little evidence of <b>credit</b> <b>advice</b> having a positive impact. Originality/value: The paper is one of only a few to analyze farmers’ perceptions of advice impact and, as far as we are aware, is the first to analyze how advice effectiveness varies according to farmer and farm characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The project ‘Coalition to Diversify Income through Underused Crops’ (CoDI) {{operates}} in Vietnam and India since 2008. The project supports local {{communities in the}} production, processing and marketing of neglected crops – local grains, fruits and vegetables. Those varieties have close relation with local territory. An evaluation of the situation of previous activities in India and Vietnam showed that the key weaknesses were: • Demonstrations were not enough and too far away and too far apart. • Post-harvest handling and processing methods suggested were too complicated. • No financial support was provided. • Not enough training courses were offered and access to information was limited. The main question was how to help farmers to produce indigenous species {{on a larger scale}} in a localized area for a marketing purpose. The CoDI project has chosen the Innovation System Approach to realize action-research for development with four main activities, owned and managed by the communities: 1. Food Processing Parks (FPPs), to which people are coming for training, information and business development services, processing, grading and other post-harvest activities and for wider support on available market opportunities, <b>credit</b> <b>advice</b> and links to other value chain actors at local, national and international levels. 2. Village Crop Fairs, during which local fruits and plants are being evaluated and the best ones selected by the communities. 3. Community Germplasm Orchards (nurseries), which then receive planting material from the selected lines for further propagation and which also serve as training grounds for plant propagation and nursery management skills. 4. Annual Knowledge Fairs, to communicate and discuss the experience with wider stakeholders from the public and private sector. The coalition builds upon in-depth experience of each of the partners in Vietnam on making markets work for the poor by facilitating links between rural cooperatives and urban quality distribution, focusing on women farmers who form the majority of vegetable and traditional crops producers, in an increasing urban environment where many men move to the towns for off-farm employment. farmer association, traditional products, market access 2, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of a questionnaire that included 418 peasants proportionately distributed in four Croatian agricultural regions. The researchers estimate that most of the respondents belonged to the 10 - 15 per cent Croatian peasants with above-average land acreage, yonger and better educated, more ambitious in production and entrepreneurship. These are peasants who have most need of an agricultural advisory service, and through which such a Service can best implement its function of advancing Croatian family agriculture. Research focused around the experiences of peasants in using the Public Advisory Service and what they expect from that service in the future. The most important results show that Service advisors have to date provided technical and agricultural-technology advice more often than peasants asked for it, while peasants asked for advice on economic and legal issues more frequently than this advice was available. As for peasants’ future expectations from the Service, economic questions continued in the foreground (the possibility of obtaining <b>credits,</b> <b>advice</b> on marketing their products, and on more favourable purchase of production materials), but there was also interest in technological advice.

40|$|The {{recognition}} {{of the role of}} a viable small business sector in sustainable development has fuelled the debate as to the most effective and cost-efficient ways of promoting entrepreneurs and small-scale enterprises (SSE).

But increasingly questions are being asked as to the cost-efficiency of such measures and the efftcacy of the institutions providing such services. Research has not only highlighted the limited return on much of this support in terms of long-term growth, profits generated or jobs created; but has also stressed the importance of appropriate delivery systems and the institutional culture of enterprise support agencies. An increasing number of commentators suggest that it is the wider policy environment that is the key to whether any small business can survive profitably.

MacDonald was driving a car owned and designed by Mickey Thompson, the #83 [...] "Sears-Allstate Special". Thompson had requested USAC officials to visit his shop in California to inspect the car while it was under construction, so that he would not invest money in the car if there was a chance that it would be disqualified at the Speedway. USAC accepted the request and passed the car with its ground effects package. By the time the car reached the Speedway in May USAC had changed their mind and failed it. Working in the cramped spaces of the garage area Thompson and crew practically rebuilt the car to meet the new USAC specs. These changes, removal of the fenders, changing to larger tires and increasing the height from two inches to four made the cars very unstable. [...] Graham Hill tested the vehicle before Indy, but refused to drive it in 1963. Masten Gregory crashed earlier in the month due to aerodynamic lift.

40|$|Regulation {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in shaping the financial services sector in Australia over the past few decades. Regulatory changes have included the establishment of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), floating the Australian dollar, allowing foreign financial institutions to operate domestically, the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge, and the removal of interest rate controls. As the economy emerges from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, a new force of change that is recognised as one of the most significant sources of risk and opportunity facing the business community in the foreseeable future has come to the forefront: climate change. Climate change is expected to be a significant change agent in the financial services sector as extreme weather patterns, sea level rises and atmospheric changes impact on asset values (both investment and lending), project finance and risk products. The financial services industry will particularly be affected by these developments, both as a provider of financial products (capital, <b>credit,</b> investment, <b>advice</b> and insurance) and through its powerful influence on the economy in terms of capital allocation. In addition, industry constituents will be impacted significantly by government regulation in this area (reporting, emissions trading and environmental policies) with respect to both their own business practices and those of their clients. This study reports the results of interviews conducted with senior members of the finance sector working in the sustainability area to gauge their perceptions of the challenges facing the sector with respect to climate change. Our results confirm that that regulatory intervention will be critical to climate change response gaining traction and momentum. In particular, regulatory certainty will promote engagement, especially in relation to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), with other developments needed in terms of information disclosure, performance and remuneration, and incentive programs. Accordingly, the significant potential risks and opportunities that climate change presents to the sector, and to the broader economy, will in part be managed/realised only if a swift and significant regulatory response is achieved.

Design/methodology/approach - To contribute to this fact, this paper elaborates credit portfolio analysis based on cluster analysis. This statistical method, so far mainly used in other disciplines, is able to determine “hidden” patterns within a data set by examining data similarities. Findings - Based on several real-world credit portfolio data sets provided by a financial institution, the authors find that cluster analysis is a suitable method to determine numerous multivariate contract specifications implying high or, respectively, low profit potential.

40|$|This study {{examines}} organic rice contract farming inCambodiaand {{its impact on}} farmers’ livelihood. The study’s objective is {{to gain a better}} insight of the terms and conditions of rice contract farming scheme inCambodia, and determine under what conditions contract farming could bring improvements to farmers’ livelihoods. This study contributes new research findings on contract farming practices and farmers’ livelihood due to organic-rice contract farming with a case study in Kampong Speu province,Cambodia. Rice contract farming is not widespread inCambodiaat present, but is expected to expand significantly in the near future. Contract farming can increase investment into agricultural and infrastructure in rural areas. Contract farming can also enable farmers to access <b>credit,</b> inputs, technical <b>advice</b> and information about market condition and pricing trends. Yet, the disadvantages of contract farming include loss of farmer bargaining power and a potential reduction in profit margins, increased emphasis on improving production quality, land consolidation in favor of participating contract farmers, and less secure livelihoods. In this study, the contract farming arrangements of Angkor Kasekam Rongroeung (AKR) Company is studied. A survey of 16 contract farmers and 20 non-contract farmers in Kampong Speu province has been undertaken to examine the AKR contract farming scheme arrangements and to identify farmer’s motivations to participate in contract farming and its impact on farmers’ livelihood. AKR rice contract farming improves farmers’ livelihood because they get a higher income and rice yields. Higher price, good rice seed, and access to market are the main reasons for farmers to participate in AKR contract farming. However, strict requirements, heavy penalties, poor extension services, and lack of information about the contract terms and conditions reduce farmers’ long-term participation in contract farming. In addition, contract farmers have less bargaining power to negotiate with the company due to the absence of a farmer association. Overall, the status of contract farming inCambodiaclearly points to the great potential for its expansion in the future. However, for this to be realized and for the benefits to be shared fairly between companies and the farmers themselves, the study concludes that issues {{about the role of the}} government, the regulatory framework, contract enforcement, and the formation of small-scale farmer organizations must all be addressed. </p...|$|R
40|$|If ACP {{countries}} are {{to improve their}} agricultural productivity they must do so through their rural people. And, if full employment, food self-sufficiency and an exportable {{surplus of agricultural products}} are to be achieved, rural people must tee motivated. Owner ship of land is a powerful incentive, especially among young people who see no future for themselves as hired labour but who arewilling to work atbuilding up their own family holding. In the majority of Caribbean countries, widespread land ownership is very recent but, in several countries where land reform and re-distribution has begun, the benefits are already evident. For much of their modern history most Caribbean countries were developed as plantation economies, where the mass of the population worked as labour on monoculture estates owned by a minority of landowners or foreign-based companies. However, many foreign-based companies, and even some large local landowners, found the combination of poor prices for the main plantation crops (banana, citrus, cocoa, coconut and sugar) and rising labour costs and unrest in the 1970 s too problematic, and either sold up or abandoned their estates. As a result, governments gained possession and were provided with the opportunity to offer the land in small blocks to previously landless people. Privatization in Grenada In Grenada, by 1983 a succession of governments had acquired 36 estates, ranging from 17 - 105 hectares (40 - 250 acres). In 1986 it was decided by the Government to 'divest' these estates: to divide them into economically viable units and to offer them for private ownership. In common with the majority of islands in the Caribbean, Grenada has a very steep terrain so at divestment, farmers were encouraged to continue to grow one of the major crops - banana, cocoa and nutmeg but to diversify by growing other crops for food and for sale. In order to do this without encouraging erosion, a programme of soil and water conservation was started in which the farmers were involved. With FAO technical assistance, settlers were helped to build bench terraces, of eyebrow terraces, access roads and dams. A wide range of fruit trees was planted, while leucaena and Honduran Pine were planted on the steepest land as conservation forest The idea was to provide improved income, long-term security and to involve the new settlers in sustainable production techniques. Considerable progress has been made: people in Grenada are increasingly aware of the need for food self-sufficiency and import-substitution; more locally produced foods are available in markets and for the thriving tourist industry; and surplus fruit is processed for jams, jellies and confectionery. There has been a deliberate policy to choose young people as new settlers and {{there is no shortage of}} applicants: there are 30 - 40 applicants for each farm that becomes available, of whom 80 %- 90 % are in the 25 - 30 age group. Dominica diversifies Similar success has been achieved in Dominica, where the main plantation crops were banana and limes. Again, these remain the major crops on the small farms that have been carved from the big estates. Where banana still offers a good return, some far' mers continue to specialize in the crop, but others have diversified into vegetables and tubers for the local market, ginger for export and also flowers such as ginger lily. In the drier south of the island limes were and remain the major crop but, because of the depressed price over several years, farmers settled here have diversified and grow passion fruit, Aloe vera and forage grasses for feeding to one or two milk cows and 10 - 15 sheep and goats. Some farmers are also keeping one or two breeding pigs. However, land redistribution is seldom sufficient when carried out in isolation, so in Grenada and Dominica, new farmers have been provided with technical advice and assistance with marketing their crops. In Dominica the marketing of new crops has been well developed through the Dominican Export and Import Agency, DEXIA (See Spore N 20). There is a processing facility for limes on the island and a factory for coconut products, such as oil and soap. Aloe vera, a low-growing, succulent plant that thrives on dry, porous soils, is purchased by the Windward Island Aloe Company and is used in a wide range of cosmetics and body-care products. All these marketing intitiatives have resulted in firm markets, increased local employment and added value to products, to the benefit of farmers and the national economy. Integrated development Credit has also played an important role in developing the small-farmer economy in Dominica, as has the construction of feeder roads into previously inaccesible parts of the island. The United Nations lnternational Fund for Agricultural Development has assisted by providing funds for credit while IFAD and the European Development Fund have financed access roads. It is clearly evident that without an integrated approach of technical <b>advice,</b> <b>credit,</b> availability of inputs, access roads and marketing, land redistribution alone would not have had the desired impact and might even have resulted in stagnant production, frustration and a decline in standards of soil and water conservation.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is the {{response}} of Malay paddy growing peasants to the efforts of the Malaysian government to organize them in so called Farmers' Organizations. In Peninsular Malaysia, paddy production is geographically concentrated on a number of coastal plains where paddy is the major - and for most peasants the only - crop, and the main source of household income. AS the farms are small and productivity is low, these areas form islands of poverty in a country which is relatively affluent in comparison to its Southeast Asian neighbours. In the 1960 s and 1970 s, the Malaysian government introduced a number of measures to improve the income of paddy smallholders and to become independant of rice imports. These measures involved large subsidies to the peasants. Funds for these subsidies were obtained from the more advanced sectors of the economy, such as the plantation and mining sectors. These public subsidies should be considered {{in the light of the}} government's efforts to eradicate poverty and to reduce the income differences between the predominantly rural Malays who are the indigenous population and the predominantly urban immigrant Chinese. Practically all paddy smallholders are Malays. The most important development in the paddy sector was the construction of large scale drainage and irrigation schemes in the coastal paddy areas, in order to enable the production of two paddy crops per year (double cropping). As an additional measure steps were taken to help the peasants obtain the full benefits of these facilities by establishing Farmers' Organizations (FOs) which they could join voluntarily. These FOs were to provide farm support services, such as supplying seed of new paddy varieties, chemical inputs, <b>credit</b> and extension <b>advice</b> and the buying up of the paddy. Other tasks of the FOs were to promote the co-ordination of paddy production activities of the peasants and to strengthen the peasants' position as a producers group vis-à-vis other economic interests. The main reason for assigning these tasks to a newly created organization rather to than the existing rural co-operative societies was that the latter operated on a very small scale and lacked the ability to manage these complex tasks. Many rural co-operative societies were completely inactive. FOs operated on a larger scale and the management was in the hands of government officers seconded to the FO. The activities of the FOs also benefitted from larger subsidies than the co-operatives were given. This meant that FOs, despite their formal structure as voluntary associations administered by a board and assembly representing the members, were very dependent on and strongly influenced by the government. The main objective of this study was to identify the sociological factors which influenced the response of paddy growing peasants to the establishment of FOs Three aspects of this response were studied: 1. the affiliation of peasants to FOs; 2. the members' contributions to the development of FOs; 3. the utilization of FO services and the adoption of improved paddy cultivation practices. A second objective was to compare the peasants' response to FOs, in the Krian and Muda irrigation schemes. These schemes represented the two different types of government intervention in paddy production in Malaysia. In the Muda scheme there was a project authority, the Muda Agricultural Development Authority (MADA), which was responsible for the FOs the other organizations providing farm support services and operating the irrigation system. This provided a favourable opportunity to co-ordinate the various farm support services at FO level. In the Krian irrigation scheme there was no project authority and the various services were provided by separate agencies. This made local co-ordination difficult. The FOs, in Krian were supervised by the state office of the Farmers' Organization Authority (FOA), a federal agency. This office supervised all the FOs, in the state Perak, the FOs in the Krian scheme being only a small section. Due to the exploratory character of the study, only one FO could be studied in Krian and one in Muda. It appeared that in both research areas the FOs) were in fact field offices established to perform service functions under the control and supervision of FOA (in Krian and MADA (in Muda). In both areas, they concentrated mainly on the provision to their members of short term production credit and inputs. In providing credit, the FOs acted as agents of the Agricultural Bank. The credit activities were confined to the administrative routine of processing loan applications and disbursing inputs and cash. other farm support services were of minor importance. Although initially loan repayment records had been high, the recovery of the loans had become increasingly difficult in both areas. Despite the fact that the organizational set-up in Muda offered better opportunities than in Krian to link credit supply to for instance agricultural extension activities, this however was not capitilized on in actual practice. It appeared that the main comparative advantage of the organizational set-up in the Muda area compared to that in Krian was that the MADA project authority covered a much smaller area than the state office of the FOA, this facilitated the communication between FO personnel and their supervisors. The latter could also provide more support for the field staff. This made it easier to undertake non-routine activities that required frequent consultation with the supervisors. These activities were only undertaken by the FO in Muda, which ran a chicken farm and a mini-supermarket in a nearby town. However, these activities were of minor importance when compared to the routine task of credit supply. Therefore, the difference in performance between the Krian and Muda FO. was not as large as might have been expected. In order to recruit members, FO personnel in both Krian and Muda contacted peasants who were already in close contact with various government agencies and helped other peasants in their dealings with these agencies. The task of canvassing for members was left to these local contacts. only a section of the potential membership was invited by them. A large proportion of the non-invited peasants regarded access to FO membership as a priviledge controlled by the contact person. Only the more educated of the non-invited peasants joined the FO on their own initiative if they considered this to be in their interest. According to both members and non-members the most important and often only motive for joining the FO was to get cheap credit. However, the low interest rate only outweighed the costs of obtaining FO credit for peasants who needed large amounts of inputs. Those who operated a small paddy farm could obtain their inputs more conveniently from private shops. Thus, the operators of large paddy farms were overrepresented in the FOs. In both Krian and Muda the FOs had appealed to about half of the potential membership. Members of an FO must accept some responsibility and make contributions in time and money by attending and participating in meetings and buying capital shares, if the FO is to develop into a farmers organization. These member-contributions were generally low in both the FOs studied. One of the reasons was that the individual's access to the benefits of FO membership was not directly dependent on these contributions. Secondly, the benefits remained rather limited and might not have been a sufficient incentive. A third cause of low member-contributions was the loosely structured character of the local society. This made it difficult to develop the permanent commitment required for these contributions. Finally, a fourth cause was the government's emphasis on a quick increase in the number of FOs and its neglect of the need to build up commitment of the members to the FO. This has created a tendency of government agencies to act on behalf of the peasants rather than help the peasants to act for themselves and has also contributed to the general tendency of peasants to lean on the government rather than stand on their own two feet. The board and the assembly of the FO who represented the members, left much of the responsibility for the operations of the FO to the staff. They also accepted that actions suggested by them could not be carried out without prior approval by the FO staff's superiors in FOA or MADA. Rather than administering the FO the main function of the board and assembly was to communicate the wishes of the members to government agencies over which they had no control. These wishes received due consideration and often led to adaptations in the activites of these agencies. In both Krian and Muda the efforts of the FOs to change paddy cultivation practices were confined to the provision of farm support services to individual members. There were no attempts to co-ordinate the paddy production activities of the members. The farm support services of the FOs studied had only reached a small section of the peasants in both research areas, primarily those with larger farms, more education and more contacts with the world outside the village. However, this had not led to differential adoption of the new cultivation practices. The necessary inputs were also avaiable to non-members. They could be obtained from local shops, either on credit terms or for cash. Since the extension advice given was very general and hardly changed from season to season, non-members knew what the advice included. No statistically significant differences in the cultivation practices of members and non-members were found. Peasants had tried out the recommendations and retained those practices that were found useful, while rejecting those that were not. Since then, peasants had continually experimented with new practices imitating friends and relatives and selecting their own new paddy varieties. The actual practices of both members and non-members bore only a vague resemblance to the official recommendations. The study recommends a number of improvements that could help the FOs to function more effectively. These include improvements in agricultural extension services and in the role of the FO in co-ordinating its members' paddy production activities. Apart from these paddy oriented measures other suitable FO activities should be investigated, e. g. in the small scale industries sector. Finally, the study indicates a number of problems that need to be solved before the responsibility for the FO can be transferred to the members...|$|R
