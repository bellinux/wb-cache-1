40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{proportion}} of <b>crumbled</b> copra meal and enzyme inclusion on bird performance and gastro-intestinal response was studied. Three diets with two enzyme treatments were each fed to four replicates of 10 broilers from 1 to 42 days of age. The diets contained 300 g kg <b>crumbled</b> copra meal and- 1 were fed {{either as a}} finely ground or <b>crumbled</b> or a mixture of 50 / 50 finely ground and <b>crumbled</b> copra meal, each with or without an enzyme supplement (Hemicell plus Allzyme SSF). Feeding the <b>crumbled</b> copra meal diet, which had the largest <b>crumble</b> sizes, increased body weight, live weight gain, feed intake and water consumption of birds. The gizzard size of birds fed <b>crumbled</b> copra meal in their diets was significantly larger and heavier than for birds fed the fine mash copra meal diet. The inclusion of enzyme significantly increased body weight and live weight gain of birds fed until 6 weeks of age. The duodenum, ileum and overall size of intestines of birds fed the supplemented copra meal diet were larger and heavier than those of birds fed the diet without enzyme supplementation. Including <b>crumbled</b> copra meal in the diet had a beneficial effect in increasing the productivity of birds and supplementation of a copra meal based diet with enzymes was additionally beneficial...|$|R

5|$|In the 1990s, both {{growth and}} {{controversy}} accelerated rapidly {{as a new}} plan was launched to develop the area known as the <b>Crumbles,</b> a shingle bank on the coast {{to the east of}} the town centre. This area, now known as Sovereign Harbour, containing a marina, shops and several thousand houses, along with luxury flats, was formerly home to many rare plants. Continued growth {{in other parts of the}} town, and the taming of the central marshland into farmland and nature reserves, has turned Eastbourne into the centre of a conurbation, with the appearance from above of a hollow ring.|$|E

As the series progresses, Lex's friendship with Clark <b>crumbles</b> until they consider themselves enemies. The role was difficult to cast; Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice and, feeling {{that he did not}} take his first audition seriously enough, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene indicating where to be funny, charismatic or menacing. His second audition went so well that he was hired. Rosenbaum left the show after seven seasons, reprising his role for the series finale.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit of}} {{blackcurrants}} can be eaten raw, {{but it has}} a strong, tart flavour. It can be made into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit's high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a purée, which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice. The purée {{can be used to make}} blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding, or apples in <b>crumbles</b> and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of Rødgrød, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines.|$|E

The knights make their way {{into the center of the}} fortress, where a giant blastia is found to be using the aer. Niren uses the device given by Rita to stifle the gushing of aer, but a backlash is caused by the sudden ceasing of aer flow, and the blastia explodes, destroying the barrier blastia that keeps Shizontonia safe, knocking out Chastel, and causing the fortress to begin to crumble. As Niren attempts to carry Chastel to safety, the floor beneath him <b>crumbles.</b> Niren is able to throw Chastel to Yuri and is stranded in a sinkhole of gushing aer. Despite Yuri's attempts to save him, due to a wound he received during the investigation, Niren is unable to pull himself to safety.

40|$|Problem statement: Soil {{fragmentation}} is {{a primary}} aim in tillage {{in order to create}} a favorable soil environment for crop growth. Soil fragmentation is defined as the process of breakdown and <b>crumbling</b> of soil aggregates. Currently, there is no published research data on optimum tillage operations for seedbed preparation in loamy-clay soils of western Caspian Sea region of Iran. Approach: Tests were conducted on a loamy-clay soil near the city of Ardabil, Iran, to investigate the effects of different tillage operations on soil <b>crumbling.</b> Four tillage treatments: Moldboard plow (M) (conventional method), Moldboard plow and Disk-Harrow (MH), Decompactor and Moldboard plow (DM) and De-Compactor and Disk-Harrow (DH) were used in this study with four replications. The tillage depth for all treatments was about 30 cm. Following tillage operations, intensive soil samples were taken from the top 25 cm of soil at 5 cm depth increments and were analyzed for aggregate size and distribution using 9 standard sieves (0. 25 - 19 mm mesh). Analysis of variance was carried out regarding soil <b>crumbling</b> percentage and mean diameter of soil aggregates in each treatment. The experiment was arranged in a split-plot design with five levels of soil sampling depths and two main factors (tillage method and tillage depth) which were arranged in Latin Square design. Results: Results showed that the tillage treatments had a significant effect on soil <b>crumbling.</b> Also, soil <b>crumbling</b> varied with soil depth and the optimum particle sizes were developed at the 5 - 20 cm soil depth. There was a non-linear correlation between soil <b>crumbling</b> percentage and tillage depth. Conclusion/Recommendations: Tillage methods and soil sampling depth had interaction effect on soil <b>crumbling</b> percentage. The MH treatment had the greatest amount of soil <b>crumbling</b> and the best seed-bed condition...|$|R

5|$|An {{interpretation}} of {{the story about the}} Ceklin zduhać is given in an essay by literary theoretician Radoman Kordić. According to him, the story {{is a product of the}} symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhać narration and a heroic narration. The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaći, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society. The zduhać and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhać, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhać into a subject without identity. Kordić argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent narration in the story—that of the death drive—which <b>crumbles</b> the other two narrations.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect <b>crumbles</b> in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the video, soil <b>crumbles</b> down, as Björk appears, buried to her waist in the sand, wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become part of two rock sprites, that come out of the sand and start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them. In {{the end of the first}} verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Björk grabs the sand and let it slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the sand and revolve around Björk, who dances in the sand. Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Björk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Björk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themselves, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Björk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash.|$|E

5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life.
