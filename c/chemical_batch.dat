Not all commodity/petrochemicals are produced in any one location but groups of related materials often are, to induce industrial symbiosis as well as material, energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale. These manufacturing locations often have business clusters of units called chemical plants that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as power stations, port facilities, road and rail terminals. In the United Kingdom for example there are four main locations for commodity chemical manufacture: near the River Mersey in Northwest England, on the Humber on the East coast of Yorkshire, in Grangemouth near the Firth of Forth in Scotland and on Teesside {{as part of the}} Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). Approximately 50% of the UK's petrochemicals, which are also commodity chemicals, are produced by the industry cluster companies on Teesside {{at the mouth of the}} River Tees on three large chemical parks at Wilton, Billingham and Seal Sands.|$|E

In the field of statistical modeling of <b>chemical</b> <b>batch</b> processes, most research focuses on prediction accuracy, while {{the importance of the}} latter aspect is often overlooked. In multiphase batch processes, it is possible that only a few phases are relevant to certain quality indices, while different time points belonging to the same relevant phase usually have similar contribution to the quality. The regression coefficients of batch process model should reflect such process characteristics, that is, the coefficients corresponding to the irrelevant phases should be close to zero, while the coefficients of each variable within the same phase should vary smoothly.

40|$|Sustainable {{technologies}} {{are vital to}} reducing {{the environmental impact of}} chemical enterprises. Solvents are often seen as just a medium in which a reaction takes place; however they can also play a dominant role in the overall toxicity of a typical pharmaceutical/fine <b>chemicals</b> <b>batch</b> <b>chemical</b> operation. Further, careful solvent selection for a reaction may also lead to more facile separation and purification of products, thus reducing the overall cost of a chemical process. This thesis presents an environmentally benign processing technique for sustainable biocatalytic reactions coupled with facile built-in separation. An organic aqueous tunable solvent (OATS) system allows access to a hydrophobic substrate which is transformed with a homogeneous enzymatic catalyst in a single liquid phase. Subsequent CO 2 addition produces a biphasic mixture where the hydrophobic product partitions preferentially into the organic rich phase for separation while the hydrophilic enzyme catalyst partitions into the aqueous rich phase, where it is recyclable. Processing parameters in OATS systems are discussed and an overall product recovery of 80 % is observed after six reaction cycles. Additionally, greater than 99 % enantiomeric excess (ee) is shown for catalyzed hydrolysis of rac- 1 -phenylethyl acetate with Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL B) both before and after CO 2 -induced separation.
