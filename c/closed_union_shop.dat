25|$|In 1912, Rocker {{was once}} again an {{important}} figure in a strike by London's garment makers. In late April, 1,500 tailors from the West End, who were more highly skilled and better-paid {{than those in the}} East End, started striking. By May, the total number was between 7,000 and 8,000. Since much of the West Enders' work was now being performed in the East End, the tailors' union there, {{under the influence of the}} Arbeter Fraint group, decided to support the strike. Rudolf Rocker on the one hand saw this as a chance for the East End tailors to attack the sweatshop system, but on the other was afraid of an anti-Semitic backlash, should the Jewish workers remain idle. He called for a general strike. His call was not followed, since over seventy percent of the East End tailors were engaged in the ready-made trade, which was not linked with the West End workers' strike. Nonetheless, 13,000 immigrant garment workers from the East End went on strike following a May 8 assembly at which Rocker spoke. Not one worker voted against a strike. Rocker became a member of the strike committee and chairman of the finance sub-committee. He was responsible for collecting money and other necessities for the striking workers. On the side he published the Arbeter Fraint newspaper on a daily basis to disseminate news about the strike. He spoke at the workers' assemblies and demonstrations. On May 24 a mass meeting was held to discuss the question of whether to settle on a compromise proposed by the employers, which did not entail a <b>closed</b> <b>union</b> <b>shop.</b> A speech by Rocker convinced the workers to continue the strike. By the next morning, all of the workers' demands were met.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, <b>unions</b> {{established}} the <b>closed</b> <b>shop,</b> <b>union</b> <b>shop,</b> and agency shop {{since at least}} the 1880s. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the primary federal law governing labor relations in the United States, was enacted in 1935 and formally legalized the <b>closed</b> <b>shop,</b> <b>union</b> <b>shop,</b> or agency shop. In 1947, however, Congress enacted the Taft-Hartley Act, which amended the NLRA. Title I, Section 101 of the Taft-Hartley Act added a new Section 14 to the NLRA, part (b) of which banned the closed shop: ...|$|R
50|$|Workers {{have the}} right to form and join unions without prior authorization, and {{approximately}} 10% of the total work force (estimated at 5.9 million) was unionized in more than 16,000 unions. Police and military personnel may not organize collectively. Members of unions were free to withdraw from union membership. The law prohibits <b>closed</b> <b>union</b> <b>shops.</b>|$|R
25|$|In Britain, {{previous}} to this EU jurisprudence, {{a series}} of laws introduced during the 1980s by Margaret Thatcher's government restricted <b>closed</b> and <b>union</b> <b>shops.</b> All agreements requiring a worker to join a union are now illegal. In the United States, the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 outlawed the closed shop.|$|R
50|$|The {{backlash}} {{of these}} rounds of strikes {{would be a}} Republican Congress that would pass the anti-union Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. The amendments enacted in Taft-Hartley added a list of prohibited actions, or unfair labor practices, {{on the part of}} unions to the NLRA, which had previously only prohibited unfair labor practices committed by employers. The Taft-Hartley Act prohibited jurisdictional, wildcat, solidarity or political strikes, secondary boycotts, secondary and mass picketing, closed shops, and monetary donations by unions to federal political campaigns. It also required union officers to sign non-communist affidavits with the government. <b>Union</b> <b>shops</b> were heavily restricted, and states were allowed to pass right-to-work laws that outlawed <b>closed</b> <b>union</b> <b>shops.</b> Furthermore, the executive branch of the federal government could obtain legal strikebreaking injunctions if an impending or current strike imperiled the national health or safety.The result of the Taft-Hartley Act would place restrictions on Union’s ability to strike, but it didn’t prohibit them altogether. Unions could still collectively bargain for the right to strike along with any other wage and benefit package they wanted. They could still strike, but in cases it would not be considered legal.|$|R
50|$|An {{open shop}} {{is a place}} of {{employment}} at which one is not required to join or financially support a <b>union</b> (<b>closed</b> <b>shop)</b> as a condition of hiring or continued employment. Open shop is also known as a merit shop.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of reforms of trade unions by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government, and the {{introduction}} of European legislation, <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> <b>unions</b> became illegal in the UK and Equity discontinued this policy in the 1980s. However, to join, evidence must be provided of sufficient paid professional work.|$|R
50|$|A {{pre-entry}} {{closed shop}} (or simply closed shop) {{is a form}} of union security agreement under which the employer agrees to hire union members only, and employees must remain members of the union at all times in order to remain employed. This is different from a post-entry <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> (US: <b>union</b> <b>shop),</b> which is an agreement requiring all employees to join the union if they are not already members. In a <b>union</b> <b>shop,</b> the <b>union</b> must accept as a member any person hired by the employer.|$|R
50|$|Equity {{was one of}} {{the last}} of the <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> <b>unions</b> in the UK. This was criticised in 1981 by the European Court of Human Rights and made illegal in 1988, with the result that it is no longer a {{requirement}} that an entertainment professional be a member of Equity.|$|R
50|$|These {{protesters were}} {{from a number of}} ethnicities, {{including}} Chinese, Japanese, Native Hawaiian, Luso and Filipino Americans, and from many different unions, including the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. The different groups, long at odds, put aside their differences to challenge the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company. The unions, led by longshoreman Harry Kamoku, demanded equal wages with workers on the West Coast of the United States and <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> or <b>union</b> <b>shop.</b>|$|R

50|$|On 4 February 1938, strikes began. The strikers demanded equal wages {{with workers}} on the West Coast and <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> or <b>union</b> <b>shop.</b> Strikes {{continued}} well into July and August. The SS Waialeale, owned by the Inter-Island Steamship Company, which in turn was owned by the Big Five, was due to come into port on 1 August. On that day, protesters from different unions arrived to protest the ship's docking. Witnesses estimated the crowd anywhere from 80 to 800, with the newspapers reports saying around 500 to 600. It is likely, however, that there were only around 200 protesters.|$|R
50|$|A clash over <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> <b>union</b> rulings {{favored by}} the American Federation of Radio Artists ended DeMille's term as host of Lux Radio Theatre. AFRA {{assessed}} members a dollar each to help back a campaign to enact closed-shop rulings in California. DeMille, an AFRA member but a stern opponent of closed shops, refused to pay because he believed it would nullify his opposition vote. When AFRA ruled those not paying faced suspension from the union, and thus a ban from appearing on the air, DeMille was finished in radio - because he also refused to let anyone else pay the dollar for him.|$|R

The labor market outcome with endogenous membership may differ when unions behave monopsonisticaly {{relative to the}} case where they are "membership-takers", resulting in higher or lower wages (more or less favorable contract curve in efficient bargaining) according to the form union´s utility function and/or implicit decision process value union size.

40|$|Although the Conservative Party {{was always}} ideologically antipathetic towards {{compulsory}} trade union membership, {{in the guise}} of the ‘closed shop’, {{it was not until the}} 1980 s that it finally succeeded in outlawing this aspect of British trade unionism. Hitherto, the Conservatives had sought to secure a balance between two conflicting stances: instinctive and ideological abhorrence at the denial of individual liberty which the trade <b>union</b> <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> represented and pragmatic acceptance that the closed shop could actually facilitate industrial order and stability, and that for this very reason, was often tacitly endorsed by many employers. Many Conservatives were also concerned that even if they did outlaw the closed shop, it was likely to be driven underground, whereupon even worse abuses might go undetected. Consequently, the post-war period until the election of the Thatcher Government was characterised by ongoing debates in the Conservative Party over how best to secure a balance between both individual liberty and industrial order and between a majority in a trade <b>union</b> supporting a <b>closed</b> <b>shop</b> and a minority opposing it...|$|R
5000|$|By 1994, 9 {{percent of}} {{collective}} bargaining agreements in Canada required the closed shop, while 42.3 percent required the <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> and 39.2 percent used the Rand formula. Just 3 percent used the agency shop, while 6.5 percent had the open shop. Alberta appointed an investigative committee in 1994 {{to see if}} adoption of American-style [...] "right to work" [...] laws would benefit the province. The committee strongly rejected the policy after Albertan employers strongly supported the <b>union</b> <b>shop.</b> <b>Union</b> <b>shop</b> clauses in Canadian collective bargaining agreements were enforceable.|$|R

40|$|The {{closed shop}} {{has been one}} of the most burning labor issues of the last several years. It has thus far defied a {{generally}} satisfactory solution. The National War Labor Board faced the issue many times during the war and devised maintenance of membership as a temporary solution, which neither labor nor management considered very satisfactory. Fourteen states have recently tried to solve the problem by way of statutes or constitutional amendments prohibiting the <b>closed</b> <b>shop.</b> <b>Unions</b> claim that this action by the states is unconstitutional and are pressing this claim in the courts. The recently enacted Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 attempts to deal with the problem by prohibiting all forms of union-security agreements except the type known as the <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> and by prohibiting certain abuses. Labor claims that the Act has gone too far. In general, employers have described the closed shop as un-American and a violation of the individual worker’s rights. Labor has answered that the closed shop is collective bargaining in its best form. Rarely are the basic issues clarified and analyzed. It is the general purpose of this study to examine the issue in the light of experience and of an analysis of the basic issues involved. To this end we shall first examine the terms used in connection with this issue and clarify the meanings for our purposes. Next, the history of the issue in the United States will be briefly surveyed. The third step will be to evaluate the arguments for and against the closed shop and to determine which way the balance lies. And finally, the proposed solutions to the problems will be evaluated in order to find the one which is based on the results of our analysis. Advisor: Curtis M. Elliot...|$|R

5000|$|Japanese {{labor law}} treats large {{employers}} differently from small employers, and <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> provisions {{are much less}} likely to be negotiated in small workplaces. For example, Chalmers cites 1979 data showing that 50 percent of all workplaces in Japan had a <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> provision. But while 73 percent of employers with more than 1,000 workers had such agreements, just 59 percent of employers with 500 to 999 workers did so. Some agreements are ambiguously worded, making their enforcement problematic. Other <b>union</b> <b>shop</b> provisions are tied to various requirements that the union promote [...] "industrial peace", such as mandatory arbitration for all disputes and a relinquishment of the right to strike.|$|R
