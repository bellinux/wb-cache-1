Currently, the test is conducted at an external test center overseas. Such test is aimed to simulate the effects of one year accelerated corrosion in severe corrosive environment of the north-east and south east of America. However, the test results obtained do not correlate with the actual corrosion conditions observed in the Malaysian market, which is likely attributed to the different test environment of the tropical climate of vehicles in service.

50|$|The {{salt spray}} (or salt fog) test is a {{standardized}} and popular corrosion test method, used to check corrosion resistance {{of materials and}} surface coatings. Usually, the materials to be tested are metallic (although stone, ceramics, and polymers may also be tested) and finished with a surface coating which is intended to provide a degree of corrosion protection to the underlying metal. Salt spray testing is an accelerated corrosion test that produces a corrosive attack to coated samples in order to evaluate (mostly comparatively) the suitability of the coating {{for use as a}} protective finish. The appearance of corrosion products (rust or other oxides) is evaluated after a pre-determined period of time. Test duration depends on the corrosion resistance of the coating; generally, the more corrosion resistant the coating is, the longer the period of testing before the appearance of corrosion/ rust.The salt spray test {{is one of the most}} widespread and long established <b>corrosion</b> <b>tests.</b> ASTM B117 was the first internationally recognized salt spray standard, originally published in 1939.

Liquid hydrogen served as the propellant that was supplied to the reactor core by turbopumps and also provided regenerative cooling. The cylindrical graphite core was surrounded by twelve rotating control drums with beryllium on one side to reflect neutrons and boral on the other side to absorb neutrons to control the rate of the nuclear reaction in the core. The core consisted of clusters of hexagonal graphite fuel elements containing pyrographite-coated beads of uranium pellets coated with niobium carbide to prevent corrosion by exposure to the hydrogen propellant. Each fuel rod cluster was supported by an inconel tie rod. The fuel pellets were provided by Westinghouse Astrofuel's Cheswick plant in Allegheny County.

A Computation Fluid Dynamics simulation using STAR-CCM+ was conducted with the objectives of showing sufficient flow through the test cap section for a <b>corrosion</b> <b>test,</b> verifying the fluid experiment 2 ̆ 7 s validity, and explaining the abnormal pressure drop. The simulation used a polyhedral volume mesh and the k-e turbulent model with segregated equations. Convergence depended on a low continuity residual and an unchanging pressure drop result. The simulation showed the same pattern as the fluid experiment. The simulation provided evidence of flow through the test cap section needed for a <b>corrosion</b> <b>test.</b> The specimen holding assembly {{was found to be}} a small contributor to the pressure drop. The counterintuitive pressure drop was found to be the sum of many factors produced from the geometry of the test cap section. The inlet of the test cap section behaved as a diverging nozzle before a sudden expansion into the test cap section chamber with both creating a pressure drop. The chaotic flow inside the chamber gave rise to pressure loss from mixing. The fluid exited the chamber through a sudden contraction to a converging nozzle behaving exit, again, producing a pressure drop. By varying the flow rate in the simulation, a disturbance in the flow where the gap fluid separated into the parallel channels was found at high flow rates.
