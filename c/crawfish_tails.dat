Statistical tests revealed that the attribute interactions were not significant, and part-worth utilities for all main effects were estimated using an additive preference model.

40|$|Abstract. Few aquatic {{products}} of the United States have limited competition from imported supplies. This situation existed with the domestic supply of freshwater crawfish until 1994. The 52 thousand MT round weight domestic production from aquaculture and capture fisheries experienced major import competition at that point. Imports of value added crawfish products increased {{to the point that}} an antidumping petition (marketing at less than fair market value) was filed with the U. S. International Trade Commission. An investigation led to a finding of an industry being materially injured by reason of <b>crawfish</b> <b>tail</b> meat imports from China being sold in the U. S. at less than fair value (LTFV). Tariffs averaging 123 % were established. The tariff remedy had limited impact. The competitive condition of the domestic crawfish processing industry was not restored during {{the first three years of}} the five-year tariff period. Severe domestic tail meat shortages resulted from two consecutive years of drought in producing areas. The increase in domestic tail meat prices was large enough to re-establish the pre-tariff importdomestic price difference...|$|R
