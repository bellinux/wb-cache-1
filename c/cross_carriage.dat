40|$|The railway {{industry}} in ASEAN {{is still struggling}} {{to make sure that}} it is still relevant and needed in ASEAN logistics industry. The upcoming ASEAN Economic Community eventually challenged the {{railway industry}} to develop itself to ensure that it could compete with the other mode of transportation in the <b>cross</b> border <b>carriage</b> of goods. The Singapore-Kunming Railway Link has given the railway industry another opportunity to improve the services and become one of the forces, which moved the sub-region economy. Accordingly, the physical and institutional developments need to be done simultaneously in ensuring the success of the <b>cross</b> border <b>carriage</b> of goods by rail. Practically, in ASEAN, since the railway industry is still as of personal interest, the developments phase is different according to the countries. The collective developments have yet to take place for both physical and institutional developments. Nevertheless, as for the time being, the <b>cross</b> border <b>carriage</b> of goods by rail in ASEAN mainland is still governed by the local law as there are lack of sub-regional level agreements to be used collectively. Protocol 6 of ASEAN Framework Agreement of Facilitation of Goods in Transit is the only sub-regional level agreement available to govern the railway industry collectively. But, it only concerns on the railway border and interchange station. The lack of coverage of other important aspect, especially the liability part, might decrease the confident and eagerness level of the members to move on with the idea of seamless <b>cross</b> border <b>carriage</b> of goods by rail. The research will look into the practices of <b>cross</b> border <b>carriage</b> of goods by rail in ASEAN mainland collectively from the operational and legal perspectives. The data from the operational perspective will provide the much-needed understanding on the carriage of goods by rail industry in ASEAN. By having the understanding on the practices, the points of similarities discovered will be used as the benchmark for the understanding of the industry. Also, the research will look into the legal aspects of the industry including the legal procedures and practices. The information from these two perspectives will provide the guideline as to the direction of the liability framework for <b>cross</b> border <b>carriage</b> of goods by rail in ASEAN mainland in ensuring the suitability of the said approach towards the industry and the upcoming free market future as it is intended to be use collectively...|$|R

The modern donkey pokes its {{head out of the}} lion's skin of old Rome, and brays out the absurdest of asinine roundelays. Conceive twenty thousand grown people in a long street, at the windows, on the footways, and in carriages, amused day after day for several hours in pelting and being pelted with handfuls of mock or real sugar-plums; and this no name or presence, but real downright showers of plaster comfits, from which people guard their eyes with meshes of wire. As sure as a carriage passes under a window or balcony where are acquaintances of theirs, down comes a shower of hail, ineffectually returned from below. The parties in two <b>crossing</b> <b>carriages</b> similarly assault each other; and there are long balconies hung the whole way with a deep canvas pocket full of this mortal shot. One Russian Grand Duke goes with a troop of youngsters in a wagon, all dressed in brown linen frocks and masked, and pelts among the most furious, also being pelted. The children are of course preeminently vigorous, and there is a considerable circulation of real sugar-plums, which supply consolation for all disappointments." ...|$|R

An involuntary contraction of the upper lip bared his teeth with all the aspect of savage resolution as he felt the train beginning to move. Mrs Verloc heard and felt nothing, and Ossipon, her saviour, stood still. He felt the train roll quicker, rumbling heavily {{to the sound of the}} woman’s loud sobs, and then <b>crossing</b> the <b>carriage</b> in two long strides he opened the door deliberately, and leaped out.|$|R
50|$|Sweden's and Finland's {{trade was}} totally {{controlled}} by the Kriegsmarine. As a consequence, Germany put pressure on neutral Sweden to permit transit of military goods and soldiers on leave. On 18 June 1940, an agreement was reached.

A total of 2.14 million German soldiers, and more than 100,000 German military railway <b>carriages,</b> <b>crossed</b> Sweden until this traffic was officially suspended on 20 August 1943.|$|R
