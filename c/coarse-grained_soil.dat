50|$|The soil of {{this region}} is acidic, {{with high levels of}} sodium and potassium. This is a <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soil,</b> with high {{permeability}} favoring the formation of groundwater in aquifers. The composition of the soil and the low temperatures contribute to the low amount of humus and poor decomposing of the organic matter making this soil largely unsuitable for agriculture.|$|E
50|$|In a sieve analysis, a <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soil</b> {{sample is}} shaken {{through a series}} of woven-wire square-mesh sieves. Each sieve has {{successively}} smaller openings so particles larger than the size of each sieve are retained on the sieve. The percentage of each soil size is measured by weighing the amount retained on each sieve and comparing the weight to the total weight of the sample. The results of a sieve analysis are plotted as a grain size distribution curve, which is then analyzed to determine the soil gradation of the particular soil.|$|E
40|$|Soils are {{three-phase}} {{composite materials}} that consist of soil, solid particles, and voids {{filled with water}} and/or air. Based on the particle-size distribution, they are generally classified as fine-grained (clays and plastic silts) and <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils</b> (nonplastic silts, sand, and gravel). Soil's resistance to external loadings is mainly derived from friction between particles and cohesion. Friction resistance is due to particles' surface-to-surface friction, interlocking, crushing, rearrangement, and dilation (or expansion) during shearing. Cohesion can be due to chemical cementation between particles, electrostatic and electromagnetic forces, and soil-water reaction and equilibrium. The basic factor responsible for the strength of <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils</b> is friction. Cohesion can be ignored. This educational brief focuses on measuring shear strength of sands (typical example of <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils)</b> where, for the same material, packing density is a main factor to be considered when one asks about the shear strength value. As the external load is applied, the soil's resistance is attained through shearing resistance, which causes the soil volume to increase (expand) or decrease (compress) depending on the initial packing density...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of soil-water characteristic curves (SWCCs) and permeability functions for coarse-granular soils {{is essential to}} the study of failure mechanisms in colluvium deposits. A dual-porosity structure is often found in coarse-granular soils with high gravel content. The special pore structure leads to small air-entry values (e. g., < 1 kPa) corresponding to the macro-pores of the coarse soil and several orders of magnitude drop in permeability in the suction range below 1 kPa. In this research, a special device was developed for measuring SWCCs at extremely low suctions (e. g., 0. 01 - 1. 0 kPa). The measured SWCCs for several <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils</b> with different gravel contents are presented. The significance of the bimodal character of these SWCCs is studied. A "wetting front advancing" method was also developed for measuring the permeability functions of <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils</b> in a large-scale soil column. The proposed methodology is applicable to wider ranges of soil suctions and coefficients of permeability than those commonly accommodated with conventional measurement methods involving ceramic disks, or column tests using conventional steady-state methods and instantaneous profile methods. The measured permeability functions for several <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils,</b> as well as their relationships to the corresponding SWCCs, are presented. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, London...|$|R

50|$|Soil {{gradation}} is {{a classification}} of a <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soil</b> that ranks the soil {{based on the}} different particle sizes contained in the soil. Soil gradation is {{an important aspect of}} soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering because it is an indicator of other engineering properties such as compressibility, shear strength, and hydraulic conductivity. In a design, the gradation of the in situ or on site soil often controls the design and ground water drainage of the site. A poorly graded soil will have better drainage than a well graded soil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Soil is {{a natural}} {{aggregate}} of mineral particles. Soils are classified into <b>coarse–grained</b> and fine-grained <b>soils.</b> Majority of the <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils</b> suit for the construction activities. Problems pose to the structures raised in/on or with fine-grained <b>soils</b> and few <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils</b> due to their water absorption characteristic and thereby swelling. Swelling soils are also known as expansive soils and {{are known to be}} very weak to support the structures. Various methods of stabilizations are in usage to make the expansive soils suit according to the specifications of construction industry. A simple, cheap, effective and reliable method of stabilization is the thought of the day. To maintain sustainable environment, {{there is a need to}} utilize industrial wastes for improving the properties of soils. Hence an attempt is made in this paper to stabilize an expansive soil using quarry dust and fly ash (Investigation is carried to find the properties selected expansive soil alone and on soil-mixtures with fly ash and quarry dust.

Applications of two wood-based products, wood strands and wood shreds, plus agricultural straw were investigated in this study. All three investigated mitigation treatments significantly reduced soil loss during both the snowmelt and summer seasons on <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soil.</b> Mitigation treatments did not significantly reduce soil loss from the fine-grained soil, although the untreated plot produced two to six times as much sediment as the treated plots. A significant amount of mitigation material was lost from the shreds and straw plots {{over the course of the}} first year. Wood strands maintained their original cover over this time period.

40|$|The {{researchers}} cannot {{control the}} composition and structure of coarse grained soil in the indoor experiment because the granular particles of different size have the characteristics of random distribution and no sorting. Therefore, {{on the basis of}} the laboratory tests with the coarse grained soil, the HHC-Granular model, which could simulate the no sorting and random distribution of different size particles in the <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soil,</b> was developed by use of cellular automata method. Meanwhile, the triaxial numerical simulation experiments of coarse grained soil were finished with the different composition and structure soil, and the variation of shear strength was discussed. The results showed that the internal friction angle was likely to reduce with the increasing of gravel contents in the <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soil,</b> but the mean internal friction angle significantly increased with the increment of gravel contents. It indicated that the gravel contents of shear bands were the major factor affecting the shear strength...|$|E

In periglacial environments, this mechanism is highly significant {{and it is the}} predominant process in ice lens formation in permafrost areas.Several models for ice-lens formation by cryosuction exist, among others the Hydrodynamic model and the Pre-melting model, many of them based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relation with various assumptions, yielding cryosuction potentials of 11 to 12 atm per degree Celsius below zero depending on pore size.|$|R
40|$|Using {{large-scale}} shearing device, isotropic consolidated-drained triaxial tests {{under different}} confining pressures are performed for three relative densities overburden material of Shuangjiangkou earth dam. The dilatancy of coarse-grained materials is investigated; {{the relationship among}} dilatancy, relative density and confining pressure are discussed; and applicability of dilatancy equation of modified Cam-clay model and Rowe dilatancy equation for <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils</b> are tested. It is found that the confining pressure and initial density influence dilatancy evidently; that is, under low confining pressure <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils</b> are characterized by volumetric dilatancy; and with the increasing of confining pressure they exhibit volumetric compression. The increasing of density results in the increase of dilatancy. Phase transformation stress ratio {{is an important factor}} affecting dilatancy, which exhibit increasing with the increase of density and linear decrease with the increase of confining pressure. According to the test data, a relationship formula among dilatancy ratio and relative density and confining pressure is obtained. Dilatancy equation of modified Cam-clay model cannot reflect the dilatancy; and Rowe dilatancy equation can reflect the dilatancy of the coarse-grained materials; but when confining pressure is higher it underestimate the compression during compression stage and overestimate the dilatancy during shearing stage.

The difference between dilatancy behaviours of <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soil</b> under K 0 -consolidation and isotropic consolidation is investigated. Meanwhile, {{applicability of the}} modified Rowe dilatancy equation for coarse-grained soils under K 0 -consolidation is tested. The test {{results show that the}} dilatancy under K 0 -consolidation is more remarkable than that under isotropic consolidation; and this difference is more obvious for coarse-grained soils with lower density. By means of the nonlinear fitting of the results of triaxial tests, a relationship formula for coarse-grained soils under K 0 -consolidation and isotropic consolidation among dilatancy factor and relative density and confining pressure is obtained, according to which, the dilatancy' strength of <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soil</b> under different consolidations can be judged.

40|$|A {{series of}} model footing tests were {{conducted}} to determine the bearing capacity and settlement behaviour of four different soils of which the first two were <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils</b> (Le. Filtration sand and Quarry sand) and the remainder two were fine-grained soils (i. e. Sil-co-sil 106 and Mil-u-sil 30) using four different sizes of model footings (Le. 20 mm x 20 mm, 37 mm x 37 mm, 41. 75 mm in diameter, and 50 mm x 50 mm) over a suction range of 0 to 8 kPa. This range of matric suction 0 to 8 kPa extends over the boundary effect, transition and residual stages (Vanapalli et al. 1999) for the two <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils</b> (Le. Filtration sand and Quarry sand). A soil container which is 300 mm in diameter and 700 mm in height {{has been used in}} the experiment. The targeted matric suction values in the soils were achieved by controlling the level of water table in the soil container and confirmed using Tensiometers installed in the soil at different depths. The experimental results demonstrated that: 1) The variation of bearing capacity of <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soils</b> (Le. Filtration sand and Quarry sand) with respect to matric suction was nonlinear in nature. The bearing capacity increases up to the residual suction value and then decreases with further increase in matric suction values. The trends for settlement are however opposite; the settlement decreases up to residual suction value and gradually start increasing along with an increase in the matric suction. 2) For the unsaturated fine-grained soils (Le. Sil-co-sil 106 and Min-u-sil 30), bearing capacity increases and settlement decreases as the matric suction increases because the suction range (Le. 0 to 8 kPa) is in the boundary effect zone. In other words, the suction range in the boundary effect zone is lower than the air-entry value (i. e. saturation zone). More detailed discussions are offered with respect to the bearing capacity and settlement behaviour of unsaturated soils including the influence of footing size on the bearing capacity and settlement results. In addition, these test results were used to verify the semi-empirical models proposed by Vanapalli and Mohamed (2007) and Oh et al. (2009) for predicting the bearing capacity and settlement behaviour of unsaturated soils, respectively...|$|R

This study is aimed at identifying the contrasting responses of suction distribution in coarse and fine grained soils to rainfall infiltration based on the rainfall and suction distributions measured from two instrumented slopes. The results showed that the suction distribution of <b>coarse-grained</b> <b>soil</b> was more influenced by the short and intense rainfall, while the suction distribution of fine-grained soil was governed by the duration of rainfall.
