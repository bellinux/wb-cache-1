40|$|There {{has been}} a lot written about the {{benefits}} <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> (CoP) in university. The benefit <b>of</b> the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> was described with respect to teachers’ qualification and teaching competencies influencing students implicitly as well as to areas related to the students themselves. Many studies prove the fact that the process of learning is of a social character (e. g. Lave, Wenger, 1991). That is why the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> present suitable environment for collaborative learning which makes the process of generating, sharing and storing knowledge easier. The present paper defines on a theoretical level the concept <b>of</b> the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and moreover, provides a brief overview of the latest research in the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> with regard to education. Another part of the article focuses on the pre-research <b>of</b> the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> at Faculty <b>of</b> Economics and Management (FEM) Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CULS). Although the authors conform with the opinion that the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> are a natural feature and spontaneously develop wherever {{there is a need for}} sharing implicit or tacit knowledge, the pre-research focused on the verification of this premise in order to continue in the research of a quantitative character.

40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Information Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. This thesis {{explores the}} notion <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> and in {{particular}} how they {{make sense of their}} environment in order to create knowledge and enable learning. Traditionally <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> are viewed as stewards of expert knowledge, but this thesis argues that they are better understood as sensemaking phenomena. Chapter one introduces the theory of sensemaking as developed by Karl Weick. This chapter introduces the seven properties of sensemaking. It also explores organisational sensemaking by taking the intersubjective and generic subjective levels of sensemaking into account. Chapter two focuses on the literature on <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> as self-organising knowledge structures. Three structural aspects <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> this kind are introduced, namely domain, community and practice. Following Etienne Wenger two additional aspects <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice—namely meaning and identity—are analyzed as these provide the basis for a link to sensemaking theory. In the final part of this chapter the downside <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> is reviewed as they do not only present opportunities but also unique challenges for organisations. Chapter three combines the conclusions from the previous two chapters by interpreting <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> from a sensemaking perspective. The seven properties of sensemaking are applied to <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and the role <b>of</b> meaning in <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> is viewed through the lens of sensemaking. Furthermore the role <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> might play in enhancing the phases of organisational sensemaking is indicated. Chapter four concludes that <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> indeed function as sensemaking phenomena in their environments. It is argued that nurturing <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> as centres <b>of</b> sensemaking could be advantageous to organisations and recommendations are made on how to best achieve this...|$|R
2500|$|Contemporary sociolinguistic {{studies suggest}} that styles are learned, rather than {{assigned}} {{at the time of}} birth. With that said, identities emerge in a time series of social practice, through the combined effects of structure and agency. Because social identities are not static, the speech community model, which was traditionally employed as a sociolinguistic framework in the study of language and gender, is not as reliable as the <b>community</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> model, the new framework emerged from practice theory. Also because social identities are not static, speech styles are actively subject to change, such that one's speech styles have different social meanings across time. Similarly, it is possible for an individual to engage in multiple identity practices simultaneously, and move from one identity to another unconsciously and automatically, and thus the term polyphonous identity. Podesva (2004) is a paper that studies recordings of a gay medical student, whom he called [...] "Heath", as he moved through different situations {{in the course of his}} everyday life. The fact that Heath's pronunciation of the voiceless alveolar stop, /t/, varies when he deals with different groups of people suggest not only some of gay people's speech features, but also the multiplicity of a person's social identity. Furthermore, Podesva also examined the relationship between the California Vowel Shift (CVS) and the gay identity, again by investigating intra-speaker patterns in a single individual, Regan, as opposed to inter-speaker variation, and found that Regan, who is a self-identified gay Asian American, realized CVS differently depending on the context, whether it be a [...] "boys' night out," [...] "dinner with friend," [...] or [...] "meeting with supervisor". This cross-situational patterns are critical in the sense that an individual's speech styles can change not only across time, but also across space, depending on which social identity the individual is attempting to engage in under a given situation. Over-generalizations of social identity, however, overlook this intra-speaker variability.|$|E

Not much research have been done on their application in learning organisations such as academic libraries, however. The aim of this study was therefore to determine how knowledge can be managed through <b>Communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Practice</b> in a learning organisation such as an academic library. The investigation was build around the concepts knowledge management, learning organisations and <b>Communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Practice</b> and the interrelationship between these concepts. The role <b>Communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Practice</b> play in the management of knowledge in a learning organisation is investigated as well as the development stages in the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Practice</b> to support knowledge management. This is followed by an investigation of the factors critical to the success <b>of</b> <b>Communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Practice</b> in a learning organisation. The investigation consisted of a literature study to help define the key concepts and to lay a framework for the research design, and is followed by an empirical study where interviews were held with some of the staff members of the Academic Information Service (AIS) of the University of Pretoria, South Africa. In conclusion {{it was found that the}} AIS was considered a learning organisation and that the AIS was in the beginning stages of knowledge management. A number <b>of</b> <b>Communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Practice</b> in the AIS were identified that existed internally and externally, and the small number <b>of</b> internal <b>Communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>Practice</b> in the AIS were linked to specific inhibiting factors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find the balance between teams and <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in {{knowledge}} management. Lopez-Nicolas and Meroño-Cerdán (2009) among others, state that knowledge management is source of sustainable competitive advantage for firms. However McDermott and Wenger argue that to leverage knowledge, organisations need both teams and <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice.</b> <b>Communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practices</b> are informal, self-organising sub-organisational units where employees meet like minded people to discuss and exchange knowledge. Scholars argue that to create knowledge, especially tacit knowledge, <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> are more effective than teams. Therefore teams should be used for implementing knowledge while communities are to be used for creating knowledge. A case study company was used to investigate these issues. The case company is a project management consultancy company; the largest of its kind in the Scandinavia. The investigative methods employed were semi-structured interviews of the company employees, documents and website analysis and observation of the company culture. The organisation had just recently formally recognised <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> that exist within the company. The company supports <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> through encouraging social gatherings of employees, weekly discursive meetings and providing enabling technology for collaboration among employees that a spatially separated.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between a multidimensional model <b>of</b> school <b>community</b> and civic engagement were examined using survey data collected for the 1999 IEA Civic Education Study from large, nationally representative samples of adolescents in Australia and the United States. This study extends previous research {{by considering the}} extent to which multiple dimensions <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> influence the development of various civic capacities, and by utilizing multilevel regression techniques. The investigation also examined {{the extent to which}} the various dimensions <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> are related to more equitable civic outcomes, and how these associations vary in Australia compared to the United States. All schools have some form of social and cultural context that influences learning. This study examined the influence of three specific dimensions <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in school, the discourse community, the collaborative community, and the participatory community on three capacities for civic engagement (civic knowledge, norms of democracy, and expectations for informed voting). Other measures of school structure, including individual socioeconomic background and school size and composition were also used in the analyses. The results of the analyses suggest that important, yet subtle, distinctions exist between the association of the various dimensions <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and civic capacities in Australia and the United States. The findings from the fully conditional models, for example, indicate that both student level and school level perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> can help to shape adolescent civic capacities, although the patterns of relationships vary by dimension <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and measure <b>of</b> civic engagement. This study offers support for the role <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in the development of student civic outcomes. Individual student participation in and supportive school contexts for positive <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> influences the development of adolescent civic engagement.
