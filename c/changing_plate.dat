40|$|Abstract: The Oligocene–Miocene {{was a time}} {{characterized}} by major climate changes as well as <b>changing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations. The Middle Miocene Climate Transition (17 to 11 Ma) may even have been triggered by a plate tectonic event: {{the closure of the}} eastern Tethys gateway, the marine connection between the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. To address this idea, we focus on the evolution of Oligocene and Miocene foreland basins in the southernmost part of Turkey, the most likely candidates to have formed this gateway. In addition, we take the geodynamic evol-ution of the Arabian–Eurasian collision into account. The Mus ̧ and Elazıg ̆ basins, located {{to the north of the}} Bitlis–Zagros suture zone, were most likely connected during the Oligocene. The deepening of both basins is biostratigraphically dated by us to occur during the Rupelian (Early Oligocene). Deep marine conditions (between 350 and 750 m) prevailed until the Chattian (Late Oligocene), when the basins shoaled rapidly to subtidal/intertidal environment in tropical to subtropical conditions, as indicated by the macro-fossil assemblages. We conclude that the emergence of this basin during the Chattian severely restricted the marine connection between an eastern (Indian Ocean) and western (Mediterranean) marine domain.

The present work investigates the problem of linear buckling of simply supported thin plates subjected to patch compression.

The buckling coefficient is determined for different load cases applied to a range of plate with various edge ratios. The achieved results are summarised through different graphs representing variation of the buckling coefficient against the plate ratio for each load case treated.

40|$|The {{negative}} buoyancy force exerted by a subducting oceanic slab {{depends on its}} descent velocity, and strongly on its age. For lithosphere close to thermal equilibrium, this force dominates by a large margin the resisting forces arising from friction on the plate boundary and compositional buoyancy. This may result in oceanward migration of the trench, with associated back-arc spreading. However, the strong age dependence of this force, and of the ridge push mean that a horizontal compressive stress is required to continue subduction if <b>changing</b> <b>plate</b> geometry should bring young lithosphere to the trench. Estimates can {{be made of the}} slab age, as a function of descent velocity, at which the driving forces are no longer sufficient to overcome a given resisting force. The transition corresponding to a resisting force of 8 × 1012 N/m divides regions displaying back-arc extensional tectonics from those displaying compressional tectonics. This is in good agreement with other estimates of the forces resisting slab motion. It is suggested that an increase in the width of - or the shear stress on - the plate boundary, associated with the subduction of lithosphere to the buoyant side of this transition, can result in a compressional stress on the overriding plate which is great enough to account for cordilleran tectonics. The proposed reduction in the one of driving forces of plate motion is still consistent with observations, being compensated by the greater relative importance of the push from the ridges. © 1980...|$|E

Sixty-one mineral grains and groundmass fragments from 21 samples were analysed by incremental heating, while 99 mineral grains from 10 samples were analysed by total fusion. Fourteen samples are from localities dated previously by the K – Ar method. The 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages are reproducible among different aliquots {{from the same}} sample and different samples from the same location, and correlate with latitude, ranging from 30. 6  ±  0. 3  Ma on Fraser Island in the north (25 °S) to 25. 8  ±  0. 2  Ma at Flinders Peak in the south (27. 7 °S). This age progression is not evident from K – Ar ages compiled for the same region.

40|$|Large tectonic {{plates are}} known to be {{susceptible}} to internal deformation, leading to a~range of phenomena including intraplate volcanism. However, the space and time dependence of intraplate deformation and its relationship with <b>changing</b> <b>plate</b> boundary configurations, subducting slab geometries, and absolute plate motion is poorly understood. We utilise a buoyancy-driven Stokes flow solver, BEM-Earth, to investigate the contribution of subducting slabs through time on Pacific plate motion and plate-scale deformation, and how this is linked to intraplate volcanism. We produce a series of geodynamic models from 62 to 42 Ma in which the plates are driven by the attached subducting slabs and mantle drag/suction forces. We compare our modelled intraplate deformation history with those types of intraplate volcanism that lack a clear age progression. Our models suggest that changes in Cenozoic subduction zone topology caused intraplate deformation to trigger volcanism along several linear seafloor structures, mostly by reactivation of existing seamount chains, but occasionally creating new volcanic chains on crust weakened by fracture zones and extinct ridges. Around 55 Ma, subduction of the Pacific-Izanagi ridge reconfigured the major tectonic forces acting on the plate by replacing ridge push with slab pull along its northwestern perimeter, causing lithospheric extension along pre-existing weaknesses. Large-scale deformation observed in the models coincides with the seamount chains of Hawaii, Louisville, Tokelau and Gilbert during our modelled time period of 62 to 42 Ma. We suggest that extensional stresses between 72 and 52 Ma are the likely cause of large parts of the formation of the Gilbert chain and that localised extension between 62 and 42 Ma could cause late-stage volcanism along the Musicians volcanic ridges. Our models demonstrate that early Cenozoic changes in Pacific plate driving forces only cause relatively minor changes in Pacific absolute plate motion directions, and cannot be responsible for the Hawaiian–Emperor bend (HEB), confirming previous interpretations that the 47 Ma HEB does not primarily reflect an absolute plate motion event...|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{load capacity}} and durability of the one-way clutches with simultaneous reduction of mass-dimensional characteristics is largely governed by improving the calculation {{procedures of the}} stress-strain state of their basic elements. Best operating practices of roller one-way clutches in drive machines show that the outer shell {{is one of the}} most loaded elements that has an impact on the working capacity of clutches as a whole. Although, when working in the drive machine, the outer shell destruction may occur quite often, its stress-strain state is, usually, calculated by the approximate and simplified formulas to calculate the rings of the simple shape with the uniform stress distribution over the cross-sections. To study and define the impact nature of the geometrical parameters of the outer shell on its arising stress and strain, solid-state computer simulation and calculation has been performed in the national T-FLEX CAD software complex by the finite element method. The article proposes to use the influence coefficients to estimate an extent of the impact of different geometrical parameters. During the computational experiment, the geometric parameters were varied in ranges corresponding to the main dimension types of the clutches used in drive machines: the inner diameter of the shell – = 40 - 240 мм; the number of block rollers - = 3 - 5; the relative thickness of the shell – = 0, 06 - 0, 14; the relative thickness of the plate – = 0, 04 - 0, 12; relative to the length of the shell = 0, 20 - 0, 50. It has been found that with changing shell thickness the values of arising stresses and strains decrease, respectively, 2. 05 and 2. 19 times more than with <b>changing</b> <b>plate</b> thickness. Processing of results of computational experiments allowed us to obtain the empirical formulas to calculate a stress-strain state in any combination and in a wide range of changing geometrical parameters of the outer shell.

40|$|AbstractSubduction zones, {{such as the}} Andean {{convergent}} {{margin of}} South America, are sites of active continental growth and crustal recycling. The composition of arc magmas, and therefore new continental crust, reflects variable contributions from mantle, crustal and subducted reservoirs. Temporal (Ma) and spatial (km) variations in these contributions to southern Central Andean arc magmas are investigated {{in relation to the}} <b>changing</b> <b>plate</b> geometry and geodynamic setting of the southern Central Andes (28 – 32 °S) during the Cenozoic. The in-situ analysis of O and Hf isotopes in zircon, from both intrusive (granitoids) and extrusive (basaltic andesites to rhyolites) Late Cretaceous – Late Miocene arc magmatic rocks, combined with high resolution U–Pb dating, demonstrates distinct across-arc variations. Mantle-like δ 18 O(zircon) values (+ 5. 4 ‰ to + 5. 7 ‰ (± 0. 4 (2 σ))) and juvenile initial εHf(zircon) values (+ 8. 3 (± 0. 8 (2 σ)) to + 10. 0 (± 0. 9 (2 σ))), combined with a lack of zircon inheritance suggests that the Late Cretaceous (∼ 73 Ma) to Eocene (∼ 39 Ma) granitoids emplaced in the Principal Cordillera of Chile formed from mantle-derived melts with very limited interaction with continental crustal material, therefore representing a sustained period of upper crustal growth. Late Eocene (∼ 36 Ma) to Early Miocene (∼ 17 Ma) volcanic arc rocks present in the Frontal Cordillera have ‘mantle-like’ δ 18 O(zircon) values (+ 4. 8 ‰ (± 0. 2 (2 σ) to + 5. 8 ‰ (± 0. 5 (2 σ))), but less radiogenic initial εHf(zircon) values (+ 1. 0 (± 1. 1 (2 σ)) to + 4. 0 (± 0. 6 (2 σ))) providing evidence for mixing of mantle-derived melts with the Late Paleozoic – Early Mesozoic basement (up to ∼ 20 %). The assimilation of both Late Paleozoic – Early Mesozoic Andean crust and a Grenville-aged basement is required to produce the higher than ‘mantle-like’ δ 18 O(zircon) values (+ 5. 5 ‰ (± 0. 6 (2 σ) to + 7. 2 ‰ (± 0. 4 (2 σ))) and unradiogenic, initial εHf(zircon) values (− 3. 9 (± 1. 0 (2 σ)) to + 1. 6 (± 4. 4 (2 σ))), obtained for the Late Oligocene (∼ 23 Ma) to Late Miocene (∼ 9 Ma) magmatic rocks located in the Argentinean Precordillera, and the Late Miocene (∼ 6 Ma) volcanic rocks present in the Frontal Cordillera. The observed isotopic variability demonstrates that the assimilation of pre-existing continental crust, which varies in both age and composition over the Andean Cordillera, plays a dominant role in modifying the isotopic composition of Late Eocene to Late Miocene mantle-derived magmas, implying significant crustal recycling. The interaction of arc magmas with distinct basement terranes is controlled by the migration of the magmatic arc due to the changing geodynamic setting, {{as well as by the}} tectonic shortening and thickening of the Central Andean crust over the latter part of the Cenozoic...|$|E
40|$|Faults play an {{important}} role in petroleum systems as both barriers and conduits to the flow of hydrocarbons. An understanding of the relationship between fluid and gas migration and accumulation, and faulting is often required during hydrocarbon exploration and production, and CO 2 storage. While methods for predicting across-fault flow are well advanced (e. g. Yielding et al., 1997; Manzocchi et al., 1999), current geomechanical and geometrical methods for predicting the locations of up-fault (up-dip) hydrocarbon migration (and leakage) are relatively untested. This thesis investigates the relationships between up-sequence gas migration in the form of gas chimneys and Pliocene to Recent normal faults in the Kupe Area, South Taranaki Basin. It undertakes studies of the Kupe Area’s structural development, examines spatial relationships between faults and gas chimneys, tests current geomechanical and geometrical models to predict up-dip gas flow in faults, and investigates the outcrop expression of fault structure below seismic reflection data resolution and gas flux rates at an onshore site of fault-related gas leakage. Data for this study are provided by highquality 2 D and 3 D seismic reflection lines (tied to stratigraphy in fifteen wells), and outcrop of Miocene and Oligocene strata in coastal cliff sections, together with methane concentration and flux measurements. Structural development in the Kupe Area was complex and provides a near complete record of deformation since the Late Cretaceous (~ 85 Ma). Basin strata up to 9 km thick record four main periods of deformation that reflect <b>changing</b> <b>plate</b> boundary configurations. Fault reactivation was common in the Kupe Area, with the locations and orientations of pre-existing faults strongly influencing the locations and geometries of younger faults and folds. Pliocene to Recent normal faults are highly segmented with low strain, consistent with an immature fault system in which fault lengths were established rapidly and subsequent fault growth was mainly achieved by accumulation of displacement. Plio-Pleistocene to Recent reactivation of Cretaceous rift faults provides conduits for gas migration from below the regional top seal in the Kupe Area into shallow strata and results in up-dip gas migration within the Plio-Pleistocene to Recent fault zones. These late-stage normal faults (younger than 4 Ma) are shown to have a strong spatial relationship with gas chimneys suggesting that fault zones are capable of producing channelised pathways for up-dip hydrocarbon migration. Fifteen of seventeen gas iii chimneys within the study area are rooted within fault zones. All of these fifteen faultrelated gas chimneys occur at geometrical complexities in fault structure (i. e. relay zones, lateral fault tips or fault intersections). Geometrical complexities are associated with locally high throw gradients which are inferred to be accompanied by off-fault strain in the form of fractures and/or bedding rotation. Three geomechanical modelling techniques (Slip Tendency, Dilation Tendency and Fracture Stability) for predicting the locations of up-fault hydrocarbon flow (leakage) are tested using the spatial distribution of gas chimneys and Pliocene to Recent normal faults in the Kupe Area. Slip Tendency, Dilation Tendency and Fracture Stability data for all of the faults analysed predict comparable likelihoods of gas migration on chimney and non-chimney sections of the fault surfaces and therefore do not provide a robust basis for predicting where on fault surfaces channelised up-dip gas flow will occur. Field-based observations of faults show that fractures observed in outcrop and below seismic reflection data resolution are localised around bends, steps and intersections of faults and show evidence of fluid flow post fault activity. In north Taranaki these fault complexities are present in a lateral equivalent to the Otaraoa top seal and, if present in the Kupe Area, are also likely to induce up-sequence gas migration through fracture networks. Methane concentrations measured at one site (Bristol Road Quarry) along the Inglewood Fault suggest that gas flux rates up faults may not be uniform over time. Based on the measured gas flux rates gas chimneys in the Kupe Area may form in association with gas migration in a series of discrete events lasting from days to years, with possible gas flows at the seabed of ~ 930 ft 3 per chimney per day or 0. 34 million ft 3 per year...|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to very low gain of about 5 {{and a short}} lifetime of about 30 - 100 hours, the primitive Audion had erratic characteristics because it was incompletely evacuated. De Forest believed that ionization of residual air was key to Audion operation. [...] This made it a more sensitive detector but also caused its electrical characteristics to vary during use. As the tube heated up, gas released from the metal elements would change the pressure in the tube, <b>changing</b> the <b>plate</b> current and other characteristics, so it required periodic bias adjustments to keep it at the correct operating point. Each Audion stage usually had a rheostat to adjust the filament current, and often a potentiometer or multiposition switch to control the plate voltage. The filament rheostat was also used as a volume control. The many controls made multitube Audion receivers complicated to operate.|$|R
