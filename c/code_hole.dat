This paper describes {{our approach to}} the problem of automatically finding the pattern in a given back-lit wholepelt image and then recognising the orientation and other major components of that pattern despite noise and pattern warping. The pattern-finding stage principally uses binary morphology combined with simple cluster analysis whilst the remaining stages notably use cost function methodology. In the latter, as applied here, all the low level constraints of the pattern are listed and corresponding 2 D geometric equations and inequalities formulated. Each point or group of points is then scored against these criteria with the leading contenders used for further scoring against higher level constraints. Results are encouraging. ...|$|R

50|$|New tape {{formulations}} were introduced. Chromium dioxide (referred to as CrO2 or Type II) was {{the first}} tape designed for extended high frequency response, but it required higher bias. Later, as the IEC Type II standard was defined, a different equalization settings was also mandated to reduce hiss, thus giving up some extension {{at the high end}} of the audio spectrum. Better-quality cassette recorders soon appeared with a switch for the tape type. Later decks incorporated <b>coded</b> <b>holes</b> in the shell to autodetect the tape type. Chromium dioxide tape was thought to cause increased wear on the heads, so TDK and Maxell adapted cobalt-doped ferric formulations to mimic CrO2. Sony briefly tried FerriChrome (Type III) which claimed to combine the best of both; some people, however, stated that the reverse was true because the Cr top layer seemed to wear off quickly, reducing this type to Fe in practice. Most recent decks produce the best response and dynamic headroom with metal tapes (IEC Type IV) which require still higher bias for recording, though they will play back correctly at the II setting since the equalization is the same.|$|R

40|$|Intelligent Gap Filling (IGF) denotes a semi-parametric coding {{technique}} within modern codecs like MPEG-H 3 D Audio or the 3 GPP EVS codec. IGF can {{be applied}} to fill spectral holes introduced by the quantization process in the encoder due to low-bitrate constraints. Typically, if the limited bit budget does not allow for transparent <b>coding,</b> spectral <b>holes</b> emerge in the high-frequency (HF) region of the signal first and increasingly affect the entire upper spectral range for lowest bitrates. At the decoder side, such spectral holes are substituted via IGF using synthetic HF content generated in a semi-parametric fashion out of low-frequency (LF) content, and post-processing controlled by additional parametric side information.

40|$|Abstract. For {{generalized}} Reed-Solomon codes, it {{has been}} proved [7] {{that the problem of}} determining if a received word is a deep hole is co-NP-complete. The reduction relies {{on the fact that the}} evaluation set of the code can be exponential in the length of the code – a property that practical codes do not usually possess. In this paper, we first present a much simpler proof of the same result. We then consider the problem for standard Reed-Solomon codes, i. e. the evaluation set consists of all the nonzero elements in the field. We reduce the problem of identifying deep holes to deciding whether an absolutely irreducible hypersurface over a finite field contains a rational point whose coordinates are pairwise distinct and nonzero. By applying Cafure-Matera estimation of rational points on algebraic varieties, we prove that the received vector (f(α)) α∈Fp for the Reed-Solomon [p − 1, k]p, k < p 1 / 4 −ɛ, cannot be a deep hole, whenever f(x) is a polynomial of degree k + d for 1 ≤ d < p 3 / 13 −ɛ.

40|$|Supermassive {{black hole}} {{dynamics}} during galaxy mergers {{is crucial in}} determining the rate of black hole mergers and cosmic black hole growth. As simulations achieve higher resolution, it becomes important to assess whether the black hole dynamics {{is influenced by the}} treatment of the interstellar medium in different simulation codes. We compare simulations of black hole growth in galaxy mergers with two codes: the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GASOLINE, and the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. We seek to identify predictions of these models that are robust despite differences in hydrodynamic methods and implementations of subgrid physics. We find that the general behavior is consistent between <b>codes.</b> Black <b>hole</b> accretion is minimal while the galaxies are well-separated (and even as they fly by within 10 kpc at the first pericenter). At late stages, when the galaxies pass within a few kpc, tidal torques drive nuclear gas inflow that triggers bursts of black hole accretion accompanied by star formation. We also note quantitative discrepancies that are model dependent: our RAMSES simulations show less star formation and black hole growth, and a smoother gas distribution with larger clumps and filaments than our GASOLINE simulations. We attribute these differences primarily to the subgrid models for black hole fueling, feedback, and gas thermodynamics. The main conclusion is that differences exist quantitatively between codes, and this should be kept in mind when making comparisons with observations. However, both codes capture the same dynamical behaviors in terms of triggering black hole accretion, star formation, and black hole dynamics, which is reassuring...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use of {{composite materials}} for commercial aircrafts has encouraged research activities in structural modelling, post-buckling response, determination and failure mode characterization, of the aircraft structures made of these materials. In order to predict the full potential of aircraft composite structures, is essential to develop a reliable methodology that overcomes the current failure design approach, {{that is based on}} the first ply failure criteria, aiming at predicting the effective collapse load of a composite structure taking into account the propagation and/or accumulation of initial local failures. In the last years, Progressive Failure Analysis (PFA) methodologies, based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), have been developed and employed to evaluate the ultimate load carrying capability of complex composite structures. The scope of this work is to evaluate the collapse load of stiffened CFRP wing panels in post-buckling regime, by applying PFA methodology. The panel shown in this work is stiffened with T shaped stringers, and it is representative of the upper surface of a typical regional aircraft wing box. By non-linear methodology, with progressive failure option, is possible to estimate the influence that the decrease of the panel stiffness, due to local buckling onset, has on the panel ultimate failure load. A comparison between the undamaged wing panel and the damaged one has been performed in order to evaluate, under compressive load and in post-buckling regime, the combined effect of the reduction of the panel stiffness and of the damage propagation. In detail, a stiffened CFRP panel without any hole and with holes (notched panel), has been analysed in post-buckling regime by applying PFA capability of MSC NASTRAN® <b>code.</b> Different <b>hole</b> locations have also been considered, in order to predict which panel zones, when damaged, can more affect the panel collapse load...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a series of}} distorted black hole initial data sets, and develop techniques to evolve them using the linearized equations of motion for the gravitational wave perturbations on a Schwarzschild background. We apply this to 2 D and 3 D distorted black hole spacetimes. In 2 D, waveforms for different modes of the radiation are presented, comparing full nonlinear evolutions for different axisymmetric l-modes with perturbative evolutions. We show how axisymmetric black <b>hole</b> <b>codes</b> solving the full, nonlinear Einstein equations are capable of very accurate evolutions, and also how these techniques aid in studying nonlinear effects. In 3 D we show how the initial data for the perturbation equations can be computed, and we compare with analytic solutions given from a perturbative expansion of the initial value problem. In addition to exploring the physics of these distorted black hole data sets, in particular allowing an exploration of linear, nonlinear, and mode mixing effects, this approach provides an important testbed for any fully nonlinear numerical code designed to evolve black hole spacetimes in 2 D or 3 D.

40|$|A special slit {{collimator}} was developed earlier for fast acquisition of X-ray back scatter images. The design {{was based on}} a twisted slit design (ruled surfaces) in a Tungsten block to acquire backscatter images. The comparison with alternative techniques as the flying spot and the <b>coded</b> aperture pin <b>hole</b> technique could not prove the expected higher contrast sensitivity. In analogy to the coded aperture technique, a novel multi slit camera was designed and tested. Several twisted slits were parallelly arranged in a metal block. The CAD design of different multi-slit cameras was evaluated and optimized by the computer simulation packages aRTist and McRay. The camera projects a set of equal images per slit to the digital detector array, which are overlaying each other. Afterwards, the aperture is corrected based on a deconvolution algorithm to focus the overlaying projections into a single representation of the object. Furthermore, a correction of the geometrical distortions due to the slit geometry is performed. The expected increase of the contrast-to-noise ratio is proportional to the square root of the number of parallel slits in the camera. However, additional noise has to be considered originating from the deconvolution operation. The slit design, functional principle, and the expected limits of this technique will be discussed...|$|R

If the percentage is more than 4 %, its effect toward its strength should be considered. But the Code does not mention {{the effect of the}} hollow cross section on the ductility. This study was done by testing hollow and solid columns with variation as follows: single stirrup ratio = 0. 0184, double stirrup ratio = 0. 0276, longitudinal steel ratio = 0. 0252, concrete compression strength f’c = 26 MPa, column cross-section b = h = 200 mm, column length L = 1100 mm, hole-ratio (0 %, 4. 53 %, 7. 07 %). Both ends of the column are loaded by constant axial compression load of 0. 12 f’cAg = 12, 5 ton, lateral loads are applied at 1 / 3 and 2 / 3 points to produce moments. The observed variables are moment and curvature ductility. The result of the study shows that the 4 % hollow column still has the same moment strength as the solid one. This experiment also indicates that its curvature ductility is within the range of 6. 14    8. 49, thus showing that the columns should be considered as limited ductile structure. If the hole-ratio is more than 4 %, however, a decrease in the curvature ductility will be found.
