5000|$|Groups {{of migrant}} workers are {{composed}} {{of a variety of}} nationalities, but are generally united {{by the fact that the}} large majority send money to family members and relatives in their respective countries of origin. Migrants in the GCC countries are generally denied the right to own property and bring family members with them to the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> These factors generally contribute to migrants' intentions not to stay in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> for the entirety of their life. Contrary, most migrants have the intent to return to their respective countries of origin. However, the work conducted by migrants in the GCC constitutes an important section of the economy in the country of origin, as money is sent home to family members and relatives. India receives approximately half of all remittances from Indian migrants in the GCC countries and further constitutes the country sending most migrants to the region.|$|E

50|$|Regardless {{of their}} <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> migrant {{domestic}} workers experience social {{isolation from the}} local community, {{as well as from}} their home community, resulting from the move to a different country. Since they typically leave their families behind, migrant domestic workers are separated physically from their social network, including their children and close relatives, which contributes to their social isolation. The language and cultural barriers further complicate this transition and make it difficult for these workers to connect with the local population. Due to the language barrier, migrant domestic workers know little to nothing about the local laws to protect themselves from abuse in the work place. This prevents them from raising awareness about their working conditions and from forming collective action.|$|E
50|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century piracy and privateering became less-acceptable behaviour, {{especially}} as many privateers turned into full-blown pirates so {{they would not have}} to give part of the profit they made back to their <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> Corruption led to the removal of many officials over the years, including Governor Nicholas Trott and Governor Benjamin Fletcher. One way that governments found and discouraged active pirates and corrupt privateers was through the use of “pirate hunters” who were bribed with all or at least most of the wealth that they would find aboard pirate vessels, along with a set bounty. The most renowned pirate hunter was Captain William Kidd, who hit the peak of his legal career in 1695 but later saw the benefits of illegal piracy and made that his new vocation.|$|E

40|$|Police in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) now {{routinely}} use {{risk assessment}} tools to identify common {{risk factors for}} re-abuse and lethality when responding to domestic abuse. Nevertheless, {{little is known about}} the extent to which officers understand and perceive the importance of factors commonly included on risk assessment tools for predicting future abuse. This study attempts to shed some light into this area of research by exploring the responses of 720 British and American police officers to questions regarding how important and how essential various risk factors are for evaluating the level of risk or harm a victim of domestic abuse may face in the future. Findings indicated that British and American officers were largely in agreement about a small constellation of risk factors that they considered integral to the risk assessment process: using or threatening to use a weapon; strangulation; physical assault resulting in injury and escalation of abuse. The results revealed that officers’ <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> rather than their demographic characteristics or experience policing domestic abuse, was a particularly influential predictor of their perceptions, and that both the situational context and the victim’s perception about risk are important in domestic abuse risk assessment...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to analyse if the six month rule in chapter 3 § 9 part 1 in IL is {{compatible}} with EU law regarding the free movement of employees and in case of discrimination whether the rule can be justified. First of all the retroactive salary for an unlimited taxpayer and {{during the period of}} income earning a limited taxpayer who later became unlimited taxpayer will be analyzed in order to determine if they are considered to be in a comparable situation. An unlimited taxpayer is subject to taxation in Sweden for all of his incomes regardless their origin. However there is an exception according to six month rule, which implies that physical persons who stay abroad due to their minimum six months employment are in Sweden free from their incomes earned abroad if they are taxed in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> Tax exemption is applicable even if the payment from an employee working abroad is made retroactively. Article 18 EUFF states a general prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of nationality. In the area of tax legislation it happens not very often that physical persons become an object of direct discrimination. The direct discrimination as well as all form of indirect discrimination is included in prohibition of discrimination. The comparable situations where different rules are applied result in discrimination. The situations given in the thesis are considered to be comparable but the six months rule has only resulted in tax exemption in one of the situations, which implies that discrimination took place. The discrimination depended on other criteria than nationality but the result was the same as the discrimination on the grounds of nationality. Depending on some circumstances the indirect discrimination can be justifiable with help of the "rule of reason"-test. Although the six months rule is incompatible with the EU law it can be justified considering the cohesion of the tax system...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{protection}} in international human rights law of the economic, social, cultural, political and residence rights of migrant workers and their families, broadly defined as long- or short-term immigrants who are or have been employed in countries other than their own, included those who entered illegally. These are the rights of most concern to migrants in the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> Economic and social rights comprise employment rights, trade union rights and rights to social security, health, housing, family reunification and education. Cultural rights of migrants embrace their right to retain and develop cultural identity, including the teaching to their children of the culture and language of the country of origin, and political rights encompass their right to political activity {{and to participate in}} the decision-making process concerning their interests, including the right to vote. Residence rights comprise their right to remain in the host country, while in work and immediately after the termination of employment, and their rights to permanent residence and naturalization and to protection against unfair expulsion. The thesis develops a theoretical framework that is justified in terms of both individualist and communitarian liberal principales. These principles provide for conceptions of citizenship which go beyond mere form and which justify the extension of membership of the state to alien migrant workers and their families. These normative models also support the provision of more extensive rights to both legal and illegal migrants. Limiting the rights of migrants already in the territory and controlling the entry of new immigrants is justified by the principle of sovereignty on the basis of socio-economic, cultural and physical state security. This principal, however, is being eroded by the development of international standards for the protection of vulnerable groups. A redefined conception of the liberal-democratic community, which recognizes the participation and contribution of migrant workers and their families, is more responsive to the interdependence of the international community of states and more closely conforms to its own individualist and communitarian precepts. This thesis concludes with the conviction that the adequate realization of the rights of alien migrant workers and their families can only serve to advance the rights of all human beings, including citizen-members of states.

40|$|Since the nineties, Greece, {{like other}} Southern European countries, {{has changed from}} being a <b>country</b> <b>of</b> migratory origin to a {{destination}} country for migrants. This, in itself, has {{been the result of}} fundamental political and economic reforms across Eastern Europe, as well as of demographic and economic developments within Greece. The first officially available data on migrants in Greece – <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin, <b>employment,</b> education level or marital status- had been extracted from the 2001 population census. There are interesting points to be made regarding their spatial distribution. Migrants of Albanian origin, the most heavily represented migrant ethnic group, have a more or less even distribution across Greek regions. However, migrants of other ethnic origin seem to cluster in different regions.

40|$|After a brief {{historical}} {{review of}} migrations in Europe, the paper focuses on current migration trends and their consequences. At {{the end of}} the 1950 s, Western Europe began to recruit labour from several Mediterranean countries – Italy, Spain, Portugal and former Yugoslavia, and later from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Turkey. Some countries, such as France, Great Britain and the Netherlands, recruited also workers from their former colonies. In 1970 Germany had the highest absolute number of foreigners, followed by France, and then Switzerland and Belgium. The total number of immigrants in Western Europe was twelve million. During the 1970 s mass recruitment of foreign workers was abandoned, and only the arrival of their family members was permitted, which led to family reunification in the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> Europe closed its borders, with the result that clandestine migration increased. The year 1989 was {{a turning point in the}} history of international migrations. The political changes in Central and Eastern Europe brought about mass migration to the West, which culminated in the so-called “mass movement of 1989 – 1990 ”. The arrival of ethnic Germans in Germany, migration inside and outside of the territory of the former Soviet Union, an increase in the number of asylum seekers and displaced persons, due to armed conflicts, are – according to the author – the main traits of current migration. The main part of the paper discusses the causes and effects of this mass wave, as well as trends in labour migration, which is still present. The second part of the paper, after presenting a typology of migrations, deals with the complex processes that brought about the formation of new communities and led to the phenomenon of new ethnic minorities and to corresponding migration policies in Western European countries that had to address these issues...|$|R
