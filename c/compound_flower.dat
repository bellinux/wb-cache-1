The trunk is buttressed and can reach [...] in diameter. The bark is yellow-brown. It can also grow as on other plants as a hemiepiphyte, or [...] high lithophyte. Alternately arranged on the stems, the ovate (egg-shaped), [...] (reverse egg-shaped) or oval-shaped leaves are anywhere from [...] long and [...] wide, on -long petioles (stalks that join the leaves to stems). They are smooth or bear tiny rusty hairs. There are 16 to 62 pairs of lateral veins that run off the midvein at an angle of 41.5–84.0°, while distinct basal veins run off the midvein at an angle of 18.5–78.9°. As with all figs, the fruit (fig) is actually an inverted inflorescence (<b>compound</b> <b>flower)</b> known as a syconium, with tiny flowers arising from the fig's inner surface into a hollow cavity. F. rubiginosa is monoecious—both male and female flowers are found on the same plant, and in fact in the same fruit, although they mature at different times. Often growing in pairs, the figs are yellow initially and measure [...] across. Ripening to red in colour, they are tipped with a small nipple and on a [...] stalk. Fruits ripen throughout the year, although more so in spring and summer. Some trees have ripe and unripe fruit at the same time.|$|E

40|$|Most {{people think}} they know all about figs: They are very ancient, easy to grow, {{propagate}} and fruit, and subject to few pests and diseases. The only real problems are birds, gophers and nematodes. That is what I used to think until I started to really study figs. The edible fig is not a fruit botanically, but a <b>compound</b> <b>flower</b> with juicy parts. The actual "fruits " of the fig are inside the flower. Each seed is surrounded by juicy pulp which are drupelets. But for practical purposes we can call a fig a "fruit. " On {{the bottom of the}} "fruit " (syconium) is an eye (ostiole) that serves a very important function: It affords an entrance for pollinating insects. A small eye has the advantage of being able to exclude insects (in figs that don't require pollination) as well as being much less prone to splitting when ripe. Some figs do not require pollination to ripen fruits. Pollination is necessary, however, if the figs are going to produce viable seed. Edible figs have four categories of varieties, of which one, the Caprifig, has two sub-categories. All edible figs have predominant female, male, or neutral flowers. They can have one, two, or three crops a year. The first crop is called the "breba " crop, the others simply the second and third crop. In some areas, the three crops seem to be continuous. In other places, there may be a short cessation of activity or leaf fall before each crop...|$|E
