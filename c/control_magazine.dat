When it was released in 2001, Alice in Chains had only gone for about six years without a new studio album, and fans had been kept interested with live albums, box sets and myriad other releases, so why put out something so plainly utilitarian?".|$|E

5000|$|Bill Adams of Ground <b>Control</b> <b>Magazine,</b> {{reviewing}} Alice in Chains discography wrote [...] "If indeed Jar of Flies {{turned out}} to be the gateway that got so many more people hooked on Alice in Chains, it can only be said that the bands self-titled album implies withdrawals or a sense of significant unease or discomfort. The signs that something is just not right appear everywhere both on and in Alice in Chains; the front cover features a photo of a three-legged dog (one too few) while the back cover presents a picture of a three-legged mandolinist (one too many). The albums liner notes feature images of ghastly, contorted fairies with no flesh on their arms, sinister, personified bottles swimming through black oceans, cartoons of mutant animals standing on trial, synthetic limbs and more. They are images of turmoil, disease and discomfort, and its difficult to look at them." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{certified}} platinum by the RIAA, and the revenue {{generated from the}} album was used to fund the Music Bank box set. The album has received mainly positive reviews, with critics praising the compilations inclusion of rare material, along with the band's hits. Allmusic staff writer Steve Huey gave the album a four star rating writing [...] "The package is not unattractive, since nearly all the hits are present in some form; also included are the new song [...] "Get Born Again" [...] and the better of the group's two contributions to the Last Action Hero soundtrack, [...] "What the Hell Have I." [...] Bill Adams of Ground <b>Control</b> <b>Magazine,</b> reviewing Alice in Chains Discography wrote [...] "To its credit, Nothing Safe is a solid compilation of odds, ends, live tracks, studio cuts, soundtrack appearances and rarities, which serves its purpose for giving 'in-passing' fans a pretty enjoyable set".|$|E

5000|$|Bill Adams of Ground <b>Control</b> <b>Magazine,</b> {{reviewing}} Alice in Chains discography wrote [...] "For {{anyone who}} was already paying attention to Alice in Chains by 1990, that the band was signed to a major label (they were the second (after Soundgarden) of the more mainstream “grunge” bands to get signed, actually) likely didn't come {{as much of a}} surprise. The band had the chops and a sound that could pass as similar to the metal of the day (well, {{at least some of the}} time), and they were at least as good as Skid Row, Warrant, Living Colour and Winger - who were all getting a lot of attention at the time - so that Alice in Chains would even get a cursory glance from the majors seemed inevitable. Upon signing with Columbia, Alice in Chains made it clear that they were willing to play ball on major label, mainstream terms too; for the We Die Young EP, the band selected three songs from their book which most closely resembled the swaggering, crotch-grabbing norm, and played them to the hilt." ...|$|E

40|$|Stephen Willats is {{an artist}} whose works have {{explored}} new dimensions {{of the relationship between}} artist, audience and society. He has pursued the idea that the real function of art is to be a catalyst for changing thinking, the artist preferably anonymous and certainly working outside the conventional galleries framework. His works span a wide range- writings (he started and still publishes <b>Control</b> <b>Magazine,</b> his books include &quot;Art and Social Function&quot;), drawings, constructed electronic and interactive pieces and the important social or community projects. An exhaustive listing of his works is at www. lumentravo. nl/bio/stem. htm His early work did not use computers as such though he built his own special purpose devices to control his electronic pieces and the large-scale interactive works. His social project for the Computer Arts Society's INTERACT exhibition in Edinburgh in 1973 did however use a very early portable teletype terminal for the street interviews carried out in Leith and Edinburgh. This was highly innovative in those days. My interest in Stephen's work stems from his intuitive response to the complex issues linking art, technology and the artist's social roles, and his ability to move these forward through insight, technical capability and a broad social comprehension. I was trying to address such issues through the lens of science and had been impressed by the apparent solidity and confidence of his &quot;way of knowing&quot;...|$|E
