40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, {{barrier filter}} system {{concepts}} {{have been proposed}} by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier filter systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the inverted <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system and the sheet filter system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> elements can be used directly as inverted <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> elements, {{and the development of a}} new type of filter element is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> elements were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> elements, and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> elements are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system is expected to be superior to that of the standard <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet filter elements were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet filter element is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet filter element may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic sheet filter elements could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet filter system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of sheet filter element manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet filter system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system, but not as high as that of the inverted <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system. The sheet filter system has not reached the same level of development as the inverted <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system, and it will require more design development, filter element fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|E

40|$|Point-of-use {{drinking}} water filtration was studied {{as a possible}} {{drinking water}} treatment alternative in Nepal. Three filter/purifier systems, Nepalese ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filter,</b> Indian ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> and IPI purifier, were tested for turbidity and microbial removal efficiencies. The test {{results indicated that the}} filter systems had very high turbidity removal efficiencies. All systems reduced the turbidity level of water to less than 1 NTU. However, the filtration processes themselves were observed to be not adequate in terms of removing microbial contaminants. IPI purifier when used together with chlorine disinfection eliminated all microbial contamination, however, in all other cases the treated water was still microbiologically contaminated. In order to improve the microbial removal efficiency of Nepalese ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filter,</b> colloidal silver coating was applied onto the ceramic filter candle. The experiments were conducted for filter candles with several concentrations of silver. It was observed that the filters with more than 10 mg of silver removed all hydrogen sulfide producing bacteria. However, complet...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{significant}} amount of effort has been devoted to develop damage-tolerant hot gas filter elements, which can withstand chemical, high pressure and extreme thermal cyclic loading in the coal-based environment (Alvin 1999, Spain and Starrett 1999). Ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> have proven to be an effective filter for the ash laden gas streams, protecting the gas turbine components from exposure to particulate matter (Lippert et al. 1994). Ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> need to sustain extreme thermal environment and vibration-induced stresses over a great period of time. Destructive tests have been used to describe physical, mechanical and thermal properties of the filters and to relate these properties and behaviors to in-service performance, and ultimately to predict the useful life of the filter materials (Pontius and Starrett 1994, Alvin et al. 1994). Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques have been developed to determine the deterioration or the presence of damage and to estimate the remaining stiffness of ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> (Chen and Kiriakidis 2001). This paper presents a study of parameters involved in the prediction of remaining life of ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> under service conditions. About one hundred ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> from previous studies (Chen and Kiriakidis 2000) and forty-six filters received during this project have been nondestructively evaluated. They are divided in Pall Vitropore, Schumacher and Coors filters. Forty-six of these filters were used having various in-service exposure times at the PSDF and the rest were unused filters. Dynamic characterization tests were employed to investigate the material properties of ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters.</b> The vibration frequency changes due to exposure hours, dust cake accumulation, candle's axisymmetry, boundary conditions and elevated temperatures are studied. Investigations on fatigue stresses of the filters due to vibration of the plenum and back pulse shaking are also studied. Finite element models (FEM) are built to calculate the filter's dynamic response with different boundary conditions at various temperatures. The experimental natural frequencies of the <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> were also compared with an analysis of a general Timoshenko beam equation that includes various boundary restraints...|$|R

40|$|Nondestructive {{evaluation}} (NDE) {{techniques have}} been used to reduce the potential mechanical failures and to improve the reliability of a structure. Failure of a structure is usually initiated at some type of flaw in the material. NDE techniques have been developed to determine the presence of flaws larger than an acceptable size and to estimate the remaining stiffness of a damaged structure (Chen, et. al, 1995). Ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> have been tested for use in coal-fueled gas turbine systems. They protect gas turbine components from damage due to erosion. A total of one hundred and one <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> were nondestructively evaluated in this study. Ninety-eight ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> and three ceramic composite filters have been nondestructively inspected using dynamic characterization technique. These ceramic filters include twelve unused Coors alumina/mullite, twenty-four unused and fifteen used Schumacher-Dia-Schumalith TF- 20, twenty-five unused and nine used Refractron 326, eight unused and three used Refractron 442 T, one new Schumacher-T 10 - 20, and one used Schumacher-Dia-Schumalith F- 40. All filters were subjected to a small excitation and the dynamic response was picked up by a piezoelectric accelerometer. The evaluation of experimental results was processed using digital signal analysis technique including various forms of data transformation. The modal parameters for damage assessment for the unexposed (unused) vs. exposed (used) specimen were based on two vibration parameters: natural frequencies and mode shapes. Finite Element models were built for each specimen type to understand its dynamic response. Linear elastic modal analysis was performed using eight nodes, three-dimensional isotropic solid elements. Conclusions based on our study indicate that dynamic characterization is a feasible NDE technique in studying structural properties of ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters.</b> It has been shown that the degradation of the filters due to long working hours (or excessive back pulsing conditions and high temperature transient) could be reflected from the shift of vibration frequencies. These shifts are due to changes in structural properties such as stiffness, which are directly related to the Young's modulus of the <b>candle</b> <b>filters.</b> Further studies are necessary in implementing and verifying the applicability of dynamic NDE characterization methods for actual in-situ conditions, and in establishing a systematic testing procedure for field applications. Also investigations on the filter's natural frequency due to the effect of dust cake or due to the change of boundary conditions may provide insight as to how the filter will perform in the field...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} by the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) to design, construct, and test the feasibility of a hot-gas filter safeguard device (SGD) to prevent the release of dust {{in the event of}} <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> failure under both pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC) (oxidizing) and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) (reducing) operating conditions. The SGD must use existing filter system seals, gaskets, fixtures, and assemblies as much as possible. It must also activate quickly when a <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> has failed, preferably preventing dust concentrations downstream of the SGD from exceeding 1 ppmw. In addition, the SGD must be able to operate in an inactive mode with minimal pressure drop, and its operation cannot be affected by repeated backpulse cleaning events of up to 3 psia and 1 / 2 second in duration...|$|E
40|$|The {{currently}} preferred {{means of}} particulate removal from process or combustion gas generated by advanced coal-based power production processes is filtration with candle filters. However, candle filters have not shown the requisite reliability to be commercially viable for hot gas clean up for either integrated gasifier combined cycle (IGCC) or pressurized fluid bed combustion (PFBC) processes. Even a single candle failure {{can lead to}} unacceptable ash breakthrough, which can result in (a) damage to highly sensitive and expensive downstream equipment, (b) unacceptably low system on-stream factor, and (c) unplanned outages. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has {{recognized the need to}} have fail-safe devices installed within or downstream from candle filters. In addition to CeraMem, DOE has contracted with Siemens-Westinghouse, the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) at the University of North Dakota, and the Southern Research Institute (SRI) to develop novel fail-safe devices. Siemens-Westinghouse is evaluating honeycomb-based filter devices on the clean-side of the <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> that can operate up to 870 C. The EERC is developing a highly porous ceramic disk with a sticky yet temperature-stable coating that will trap dust in the event of filter failure. SRI is developing the Full-Flow Mechanical Safeguard Device that provides a positive seal for the <b>candle</b> <b>filter.</b> Operation of the SRI device is triggered by the higher-than-normal gas flow from a broken candle. The CeraMem approach {{is similar to that of}} Siemens-Westinghouse and involves the development of honeycomb-based filters that operate on the clean-side of a <b>candle</b> <b>filter.</b> The overall objective of this project is to fabricate and test silicon carbide-based honeycomb failsafe filters for protection of downstream equipment in advanced coal conversion processes. The fail-safe filter, installed directly downstream of a <b>candle</b> <b>filter,</b> should have the capability for stopping essentially all particulate bypassing a broken or leaking candle while having a low enough pressure drop to allow the candle to be backpulse-regenerated. Forward-flow pressure drop should increase by no more than 20 % because of incorporation of the fail-safe filter...|$|E

40|$|The {{analyses}} of Hot Gas Stream Cleanup (HGCU) ashes {{and descriptions of}} filter performance studied under this contract are designed to address problems with filter operation that are apparently linked to characteristics of the collected ash. Task 1 is designed to generate a data base of the key characteristics of ashes collected from operating advanced particle filters (APFs) and to relate these ash properties to the operation and performance of these filters and their components. APF operations have also been limited by the strength and durability of the ceramic materials that have served as barrier filters for the capture of entrained HGCU ashes. Task 2 concerns testing and failure {{analyses of}} ceramic filter elements currently used in operating APFs and the characterization and evaluation of new ceramic materials. Task 1 research activities during the past quarter included characterizations of samples collected during a site visit on January 20 to the Department of Energy/Southern Company Services Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF). Comparisons were made between laboratory analyses of these PSDF ashes and field data obtained from facility operation. In addition, selected laboratory techniques were reviewed to assess their reproducibility {{and the influence of}} non-ideal effects and differences between laboratory and filter conditions on the quantities measured.

In response to this crisis, decentralized point-of-use systems, such as ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters,</b> have emerged as viable options for improving water quality at the household level. This thesis evaluates the performance of five brands of ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> that are locally available in the developing nation of Kenya: the AquaMaster (Piedra candle), Doulton Super Sterasyl, Stefani Sao Joao, Pelikan, and Pozzani <b>candles.</b> <b>Filters</b> were evaluated based on turbidity removal, flow rate, total coliform and E. coli removal, and cost. The Pelikan filters were also subjected to tests for viral removal using MS 2 -coliphages. Results from studies indicated that the Pelikan filters were the most effective at removing turbidity from Charles River water (97 % reduction). Turbidity removal by other filters ranged from 88 %- 94 %. Results from studies utilizing more turbid Nairobi water showed filters to reduce turbidity by 97 %- 99 %. Results from flow rate studies performed at MIT revealed the Doulton Super Sterasyl to possess a significantly greater flow rate (0. 55 L/hr) than the other brands. The flow rates of the other filters ranged from 0. 14 - 0. 26 L/hr. Filter tests utilizing the more turbid Nairobi water showed flow rates of 0. 09 - 0. 24 L/hr. Results from coliform removal studies performed at MIT showed the AquaMaster (Piedra candle), Doulton Super Sterasyl, and Pelikan filters to remove significantly more total coliform and E. coli than the Pozzani filters. Percent removal by all filters tested at MIT ranged from 92 %-< 100 %. Filter tests performed in Kenya showed percent total coliform and E. coli removals of up to 99. 995 %. (cont.) The Pelikan filters were the cheapest filters purchased, retailing for $ 2 in Nairobi. Results of viral removal studies indicated that the Pelikan filters were not effective at removing viruses from solution. The results of this study support the use of Pelikan filters as an inexpensive and integral step in the household water treatment process. Sedimentation and/or coagulation are recommended pre-filtration if highly turbid water is to be filtered. This action will ensure a higher flow rate.

40|$|Ceramic barrier {{filtration}} is {{a leading}} technology employed in hot gas filtration. Hot gases loaded with ash particle flow through the ceramic candle filters and deposit ash on their outer surface. The deposited ash is periodically removed using back pulse cleaning jet, known as surface regeneration. The cleaning done by this technique still leaves some residual ash on the filter surface, which {{over a period of}} time sinters, forms a solid cake and leads to mechanical failure of the <b>candle</b> <b>filter.</b> A room temperature testing facility (RTTF) was built to gain more insight into the surface regeneration process before testing commenced at high temperature. RTTF was instrumented to obtain pressure histories during the surface regeneration process and a high-resolution high-speed imaging system was integrated in order to obtain pictures of the surface regeneration process. The objective of this research has been to utilize the RTTF to study the surface regeneration process at the convenience of room temperature conditions. The face velocity of the fluidized gas, the regeneration pressure of the back pulse and the time to build up ash on the surface of the <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> were identified as the important parameters to be studied. Two types of ceramic candle filters were used in the study.

Effect of each of the parameters on the performance of the regeneration process is presented. A comparative study between the two candle filters with different characteristics is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop and evaluate preliminary strength measurement techniques for high temperature <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> ash deposits. The efficient performance of a high temperature gas filtering system is essential for many of the new thermal cycles being proposed for power plants of the future. These new cycles hold the promise of higher thermal efficiency and lower emissions of pollutants. Many of these cycles involve the combustion or gasification of coal to produce high temperature gases to eventually be used in gas turbines. These high temperature gases must be relatively free of particulates. Today, the <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> appears to be the leading candidate for high temperature particulate removal. The performance of a <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> depends on the ash deposits shattering into relatively large particles during the pulse cleaning (back flushing) of the filters. These relatively large particles fall into the ash hopper and are removed from the system. Therefore, these 1247 particles must be sufficiently large so that they will not be re-entrained by the gas flow. The shattering process is dictated by the strength characteristics of the ash deposits. Consequently, the {{objective of}} this research is to develop measurements for the desired strength characteristics of the ash deposits. Experimental procedures were developed to measure Young`s modulus of the ash deposit at room temperature and the failure tensile strain of ash deposits from room temperature to elevated temperatures. Preliminary data has been obtained for both soft and hard ash deposits. The qualifier ``preliminary`` is used to indicate that these measurements are a first for this material, and consequently, the measurement techniques are not perfected. In addition, the ash deposits tested are not necessarily uniform and further tests are needed in order to obtain meaningful average data...|$|E

The metric used to evaluate stability {{in this case was}} a 10 -fold reduction in the rate of increase of viscosity as determined by ASTM D 445 (the accelerated aging test). The primary unit operation that was investigated for this purpose was hot-gas filtration.

Successfully deployed with hot-gas filtration, PFBC and IGCC technologies will allow the conversion of coal to electrical energy by direct passage of the filtered gases into non-ruggedized turbines and thus provide substantially greater conversion efficiencies with reduced environmental impacts. In the usual approach, one or more clusters of <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> are suspended from a tubesheet in a pressurized (P {approx_lt} 1 MPa) vessel into which hot gases and suspended particles enter, the gases pass through {{the walls of the}} cylindrical filters, and the filtered particles form a cake on the outside of each filter. The cake is then removed periodically by a backpulse of compressed air from inside the filter, which passes through the filter wall and filter cake. In various development or demonstration systems the thickness of the filter cake has proved to be an important, but unknown, process parameter. This paper describes a physical model for cake and pressure buildups between cleaning backpulses, and for longer term buildups of the ``baseline`` pressure drop, as caused by incomplete filter cleaning and/or re-entrainment. When combined with operating data and laboratory measurements of the cake porosity, the model may be used to calculate the (average) filter permeability, the filter-cake thickness and permeability, and the fraction of filter-cake left on the filter by the cleaning backpulse or re-entrained after the backpulse. When used for a variety of operating conditions (e. g., different coals, sorbents, temperatures, etc.), the model eventually may provide useful information on how the filter-cake properties depend on the various operating parameters...|$|R

Task 1 is designed to generate a data bank of the key characteristics of ashes collected from operating advanced particle filters (APFs) and to relate these ash properties to the operation and performance of these filters and their components. APF operations have also been limited by the strength and durability of the ceramic materials that have served as barrier filters for the capture of entrained HGCU ashes. Task 2 concerns testing and failure analyses of ceramic filter elements currently used in operating APFs and the characterization and evaluation of new ceramic materials. Task 1 research activities during the past quarter included characterizations of samples collected during a site visit on May 18 to the Department of Energy / Southern Company Services Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) and a particulate sample collected in the Westinghouse filter at Sierra Pacific Power Company�s Piñon Pine Power Project. Analysis of this Piñon Pine sample is ongoing: however, this report contains the results of analyses completed to date. Significant accomplishments were achieved on the HGCU data bank during this reporting quarter. The data bank was prepared for presentation at the Advanced Coal-Based Power and Environmental Systems � 98 Conference scheduled for July, 1998. Task 2 work during the past quarter consisted of testing two Dupont PRD- 66 C candle filters, one McDermott ceramic composite <b>candle</b> <b>filter,</b> one Blasch 4 - 270 <b>candle</b> <b>filter,</b> and one Specific Surface cordierite <b>candle</b> <b>filter.</b> Tensile and thermal expansion testing is complete {{and the rest of}} the testing is in progress. Also, some 20 -inch long Dupont PRD- 66 C, McDermott ceramic composite, and Westinghouse Techniweave candle filters have been received for testing after their exposure to the gasification environment. One as-manufactured and one exposed element was received of each material and specimens are currently being machined from these candles...|$|E
40|$|The {{full-flow}} mechanical safeguard device (FFMSGD) {{has been}} developed under contract to the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) to address problems with the reliability of ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> elements installed on high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP) Hot Gas Cleanup (HGCU) filters. Although systems candle filters are expected to perform satisfactorily when in good operating condition, the failure of even a single filter element can increase the filter system outlet dust loading enough to potentially damage gas turbine blades, contaminate other downstream processes, and limit {{the availability of the}} power system. Filter failure safeguard devices that are installed on each individual <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> element are envisioned as a guarantee of a <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system's ability to withstand some number of element failures and continue operation without these negative consequences. The intention of the FFMSGD is to provide this guarantee without incurring any significant pressure drop penalty or constraining the filter system's reverse-pulse cleaning procedures. The FFMSGD provides a clear flow path for filtered and reverse-flow cleaning gases when its filter element is intact, and activates to provide a positive mechanical seal against gas flow in either direction when its filter element breaks or fails. This activation is induced by the increase in the flow rate of gas through the device in event of filter failure. The FFMSGD is designed to be easily removed and reconditioned when the filter system is taken off line for routine maintenance. This report is intended to be issued with a companion appendix. As instructed in Section J. 12 of Contract No. DE-AC 26 - 99 FT 40678, all the restricted, proprietary, and patentable information (not yet disclosed through the patent application process) related to the FFMSGD and its evaluation under this contract has been included only in the appendix. This Final Report, which is available to the public, contains background information and general descriptions of the operating principles of the FFMSGD. This report also describes the results of various evaluations of the device at room temperature and in HTHP environments. This Final Report also includes discussions of commercialization issues. For clarity and completeness, all of the information contained in this Final Report has also been included in the appendix...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A gas-particle {{separation}} {{system was}} established to study the filtration performance where twelve ceramic filters were divided into four groups. Filters in same group will be cleaned by pulse back-flow at one time. The pressure distribution and variation during filtration and pulse back-flow washing in filter cavity and along filter length was measured. The main pressure drop occurs across the filter porous wall. The pressure at filter cavity decreases from the close end to open end of the <b>candle</b> <b>filter.</b> The gas velocity inside the filter system is generally relatively low in the vessel during filtration process...|$|E
40|$|Reliable {{cleaning}} {{of the fuel}} gas is required to meet the environmental regulations and to prevent corrosion and erosion of downstream components. The aggressive process environment in biomass-gasification power generation systems or in biofuels production systems can cause corrosion in ceramic hot gas <b>filter</b> <b>candles</b> used to clean the fuel gas. Therefore, to improve the reliability and durability of filters, the influence of steam, ash, and alkaline (earth) metals on the corrosion processes was studied for silicon carbide <b>filter</b> <b>candles</b> fabricated by Pall Schumacher. Exposures with biomass and lignite ashes caused a macroscopically expansion as well as microstructural effects that were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. All effects are discussed and it is shown that the employment of silicon carbide <b>filter</b> <b>candles</b> in water vapour containing, alkali-rich gasification environment at high temperature is problematic...|$|R
40|$|A cost {{comparison}} {{was conducted}} between the filter systems for two advanced coal-based power plants. The {{results from this}} study are presented. The filter system is based on a Westinghouse advanced particulate filter concept, which is designed to operate with ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters.</b> The Foster Wheeler second-generation 453 MWe (net) pressurized fluidized-bed combustor (PFBC) and the KRW 458 MWe (net) integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plants are used for the comparison. The comparison presents the general differences of the two power plants and the process-related filtration conditions for PFBC and IGCC systems. The results present the conceptual designs for the PFBC and IGCC filter systems as well as a cost summary comparison. The cost summary comparison includes the total plant cost, the fixed operating and maintenance cost, the variable operating and maintenance cost, and the effect on the cost of electricity (COE) for the two filter systems...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory and {{numerical}} {{analyses were}} performed at high temperature on the Pall Gas Solid Separation System Vitropore[superscript TM 1] candle filtration unit. The goal of this work {{was to determine if}} particle deposition patterns exist, to find optimum operating conditions, and to develop a validated numerical model. Fly ash from the Québec municipal incinerator was introduced into a high velocity air stream and fed at 900 [degrees Celcius] to our industry standard one-meter long cluster of three ceramic <b>candle</b> <b>filters.</b> Optimum operating conditions for filter cake uniformity were determined using statistical methods. Of the conditions tested, low ash feed rate (0. 83 g/s), low air flow rate (4. 72 × 10 [superscript - 3] m[superscript 3]/s), and off axis filter position (PIN) gave the most uniform filter cakes. Numerical model results compared well with actual laboratory temperature, pressure and particle deposition data. " [...] Résumé abrégé par UM...|$|R
