50|$|In games (especially limit games) {{with many}} <b>calling</b> <b>stations,</b> an effect <b>called</b> {{schooling}} can cause <b>calling</b> <b>stations</b> to accidentally play less incorrectly. For example, {{it is often}} incorrect to draw to an inside straight because the probability of making the draw is too low to justify the expense of calling a bet to see the next card. However, the presence of many <b>calling</b> <b>stations</b> can inflate {{the size of the}} pot, making it correct, or at least less incorrect, to draw to inside straights and other longshot draws.|$|R

40|$|Background: Instruments {{that measure}} {{the impact of}} illness on work do not usually provide a measure that can be {{directly}} translated into lost hours or costs. We describe the validation of the Work and Health Interview (WHI), a questionnaire that provides a measure of lost productive time (LPT) from work absence and reduced performance at work. Method: A sample (n = 67) of inbound phone call agents was recruited for the study. Validity of the WHI was assessed over a 2 -week period in reference to workplace data (i. e. absence time, time away from <b>call</b> <b>station</b> and electronic continuous performance) and repeated electronic diary data (n = 48) obtained approximately eight times a day to estimate time not working (i. e. a component of reduced performance). Results: The mean (median) missed work time estimate for any reason was 11 (8. 0) and 12. 9 (8. 0) hours in a 2 -week preiod from the WHI and workplace data, respectively, with a Pearson's (Spearman's) correlation of 0. 84 (0. 76). The diary-based mean (median) estimate of time not working while at work was 3. 9 (2. 8) hours compared with the WHI estimate of 5. 7 (3. 2) hours with a Pearson's (Spearman's) correlation of 0. 19 (0. 33). The 2 -week estimate of total productive time from the diary was 67. 2 hours compared with 67. 8 hours from the WHI, with a Pearson's (Spearman's) correlation of 0. 50 (0. 46). Conclusion: At a population level, the WHI provides an accurate estimate of missed time from work and total productive time when compared with workplace and diary estimates. At an individual level, the WHI measure of total missed time, but not reduced performance time, is moderately accurate. Cost-effectiveness, Data-collection...|$|E
40|$|In 1980 {{the first}} {{prototype}} {{of an emergency}} call system based on telecommunication technology in Germany was presented and tried out in a limited local pilot scheme. Setting up an alarm call system requires a user (e. g. a physically handicapped person) with a user station and a service operator. The alarm call, activated by the user pressing a button on his of her emergency transmitter reaches the receiver via the public telephone network. Most of the alarm calls (about 90 - 95 %) reaching a service station are not emergency calls triggered by a dangerous situation but so called "routine alarms", mostly socially indicated. Today, it is thought by experts, that between 30, 000 and 40, 000 people are connected up to an emergency <b>call</b> <b>station.</b> The largest operational service station (or operational headquarter) in Germany services more than 1500 people; 400 to 800 users per station is quite a usual figur in urban areas. More than four fifths of the emergency call system users are women. Most a re drawing pensions or annuities; the proportion receiving social assistance varies from 1 % to 40 % depending on the service station. The services provided for users of a private alarm call system by service operators could be made more personal in the future by including visual communcation. Considering {{the fact that many}} of the alarm calls reaching the service stations do not arise from acute emergencies but rather from the user's wish to speak to his or her fellow men, visual communication could represent an as yet unexploited means of supporting the formation of more intensive communication relationships, thus supporting social integration of the elderly, the handicapped and the infirm into a wider community, and securing the independence and dignity of the users of alarm call systems...|$|E

50|$|Calling {{station is}} a poker {{term used to}} pejoratively {{describe}} someone who consistently calls bets and rarely (if ever) raises, regardless {{of the strength of}} his/her hand.
