40|$|Objectives To analyse {{changes in}} testing for sexually {{transmissible}} infections (STI) among gay and bisexual men in Melbourne, Sydney and Queensland, Australia, particularly <b>comprehensive</b> STI <b>testing</b> (at least four tests from different anatomical {{sites in the}} previous year), and the characteristics of men who had such testing. Method Data were analysed from repeated, cross-sectional, community-based surveys conducted during 2003 – 2012. Trends in specific STI <b>tests</b> and <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> were assessed and the characteristics of participants who reported <b>comprehensive</b> STI <b>testing</b> were identified using multivariate logistic regression, stratified by HIV status. Results Among HIV-negative and unknown status men (n= 51   009), comprehensive STI and HIV testing increased substantially from 13 % in 2003 to 34 % in 2012. During the same period, <b>comprehensive</b> STI <b>testing</b> (excluding HIV testing) increased from 24 % to 57 % among HIV-positive men (n= 5532). In both HIV status groups, <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> was more commonly reported by men who had unprotected anal intercourse with casual partners, and men with higher numbers of partners. Among HIV-negative/unknown status participants, comprehensive STI and HIV testing was also associated with education level, regional location and finding partners online. Among HIV-positive men, <b>comprehensive</b> STI <b>testing</b> was also associated with free time spent with gay men and illicit drug use. <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> was related to a high annual rate of diagnosis with STIs (20 % of HIV-negative/unknown status men and 38 % of HIV-positive men). Conclusions There has been a substantial improvement {{in the proportion of}} gay and bisexual men in Melbourne, Sydney and Queensland who report <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing.</b> <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> is most likely among men whose practices put them at increased risk of infection, and is associated with a high rate of STI diagnosis. However, opportunities for <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> are still being missed, suggesting a need for its ongoing promotion...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHydropower {{projects}} are rapidly developing in China at present, {{and a number}} of high dams and large reservoirs are currently under construction or will soon be built. These large {{projects are}} mainly located on the great rivers in West China with complicated topographical and geological conditions. Evaluation of stability and safety of these high dam projects is an important topic. Geomechanical model test {{is one of the main}} methods to study the global stability of high dam and foundation. In this paper, a <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> method that combines overloading and strength reduction in a model is proposed. In this method, both the influence of excessive flooding and the effects of strength reduction of rock masses and weak structural planes on dam stability are considered. Thus, the <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> method can accurately incorporate multiple factors that affect the global stability of high dam and its foundation. Based on the failure testing principle and model similarity theory, a similarity relation formula for safety evaluation through <b>comprehensive</b> <b>test</b> is established. A new model material, temperature-dependent analogous material, is also developed. By rising the temperature and reducing the strength of the model material, the mechanical behaviors resulting from gradual strength reduction can be simulated. Thus, the <b>comprehensive</b> <b>testing</b> method is realized in a single model. For case studies, the <b>comprehensive</b> geomechanical model <b>test</b> is conducted for Jinping I and Xiaowan high arch dam projects...|$|R

5000|$|The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination or BDAE is a neuropsychological battery used to {{evaluate}} adults suspected of having aphasia, and is currently in its third edition. It was created by Harold Goodglass and Edith Kaplan. The BDAE evaluates language skills based on perceptual modalities (auditory, visual, and gestural), processing functions (comprehension, analysis, problem-solving), and response modalities (writing, articulation, and manipulation). Administration time ranges from 20 to 45 minutes for the shortened version but it can last up to 120 minutes for the extended version of the assessment. There are five subtests which include: conversational & expository speech, auditory comprehension, oral expression, reading, and writing. In the extended version all questions are asked while in the shortened version only a few questions are asked within each subtest. [...] Many other tests are sometimes used by neurologists and speech language pathologists on a case-by-case basis, and other <b>comprehensive</b> <b>tests</b> exist like the Western Aphasia Battery.|$|E

5000|$|The {{sport of}} {{eventing}} is descended from <b>comprehensive</b> <b>tests</b> of cavalry horses, {{which had to}} be able to cover uncertain terrain and obstacles at speed, while still highly trained and obedient.

As civilians took up the sport following World War I, the sport began to demand faster horses. Over time, Hanoverians have become more successful in eventing. The development of the [...] "short format" [...] event, which does not require as much galloping, as well as the efforts of a handful of Hanoverian breeders, have seen the breed advance in the sport.
