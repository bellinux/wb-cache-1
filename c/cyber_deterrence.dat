50|$|At {{the same}} time, Ambassador Ducaru has been {{overseeing}} the Alliance’s {{efforts to promote}} cooperation with partner nations and with other international organisations, as appropriate, on all aspects of emerging security challenges.Many progresses have been registered during Sorin Ducaru’s tenure as ASG ESC. One of the most dynamic areas is that of cyber defence. Ambassador Ducaru coordinated the design {{and development of the}} NATO Enhanced Cyber Policy (and its implementation throughout the NATO bodies), the reflection process that led to linking cyber to NATO’s task of collective defence and further on to the recognition of cyber as an operational domain, alongside land, sea and air domains. All these steps have been addressing the evolving cyber threat landscape. They have involved dealing with the effort to outline a new hybrid warfare context, conceptual approaches towards <b>cyber</b> <b>deterrence,</b> cyber norms and confidence building measures, cooperation and stability in cyber space, capability development, training and exercises.|$|E
40|$|Cyber {{operations}} by {{both state}} actors and non-state actors are increasing in frequency and severity. As nations struggle {{to defend their}} networks and infrastructure, their ability to apply the principles of deterrence to cyber activities correspondingly increases in importance. <b>Cyber</b> <b>deterrence</b> offers much more flexibility and increased options from traditional deterrence methodologies developed in the Cold War’s nuclear age. In addition to traditional retaliation, <b>cyber</b> <b>deterrence</b> includes options such as taking legal action; and making networks invisible, resilient, and interdependent. It also presents new ways to view and apply accepted methodologies such as invulnerability. As the U. S. continues {{to develop and implement}} <b>cyber</b> <b>deterrence</b> strategies and capabilities, there are important legal issues that require consideration, including international law, the law of armed conflict, and U. S. domestic law. This paper will identify and discuss six prominent theories of <b>cyber</b> <b>deterrence</b> and briefly analyze legal issues associated with this vital area of national security. The law not only provides important factors that must be considered as <b>cyber</b> <b>deterrence</b> doctrine is solidified, but it also provides significant insights into how these theories of <b>cyber</b> <b>deterrence</b> can best be utilized to support national strategic goals...|$|E
40|$|Cyber as Deterrent” {{authored}} by Maurizio Martellini and Sandro Gaycken, is a state-of-the-art document on the <b>deterrence</b> power of <b>cyber</b> attacks. It is divided in five parts: the first explains some characteristics relevant {{to understand the}} specifics of cybered deterrence; the second one explores possible doctrines of <b>cybered</b> <b>deterrence</b> and their effects; the third one will determine relevant features {{for the design of}} a force posture; the fourth analyses the dilemmas stemming from the uncertainty of attribution of an attack, that’s to say escalating or refrain from continuing the counterattack; the fifth part compares <b>cybered</b> <b>deterrence</b> and nuclear deterrence, concluding that the basic benchmarks underpinning nuclear deterrence are not effective for cyber warfare, and that “cyber as a deterrent” doesn’t seem like a valid tool in comparable situations of serious crisis among states...|$|R

From 1971 to 1991, it awarded 73 PhDs, many {{being on the}} Cold War, but also other topics like transnational terrorism, the implications of a multinuclear world, nonviolent resistance movements, counterinsurgency strategy, and crisis decision-making. In the post-cold war period between 1991 and 2013, 112 more PhD dissertations were completed. Dissertation topics included WMD proliferation, counterterrorism strategy and policy, humanitarian interventions, the management of non-traditional crises, strategic information warfare, <b>cyber</b> space, rethinking <b>deterrence,</b> special operations, and the changing dimensions of alliances and security cooperation.|$|R
40|$|The {{internet}} is {{a powerful tool for}} development, paradoxically it is a double edged sword providing opportunities for governments, business industry etc to develop and operate reaching the international landscape at the same time equipping the greed motivated individuals with risk free opportunities of committing crime. Cyber crime, and cyber attacks or remotely controlled attacks affect our daily lives hence no government, public and private sector can afford to ignore. E-crime observably requires that the cyberspace be regulated in order to achieve independent, in depth analysis of the phenomena and of course accomplish <b>cyber</b> justice and <b>deterrence.</b> Lack of Internationally harmonized legislation, penalty, the knowledge and expertise of cyber criminals, the lagging behind of the law enforcement agencies, judiciary, legislators, prosecutors, academia etc, and of course victims’ failure to report cyber crime incidents seriously inhibit the combat against this high tech crime...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} outlines practical {{steps that}} the United States {{can take to}} improve strategic deterrence in cyberspace. The unique character of cyberspace requires tailoring of traditional deterrence strategies to fit the domain. This research uses the Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept (DO JOC) and the New Triad as models for organizing deterrence operations. The DO JOC focuses on tailoring deterrence operations based on the actor; but deterrence operations must be also be tailored to the uniqueness of cyberspace. The effective tailoring of deterrence operations for cyberspace will require both the application of new ways and means and the tailoring of traditional deterrence concepts to fit this new domain. Practical application of cyber strategic deterrence involves: issuance of US declaratory <b>cyber</b> <b>deterrence</b> policy; removing sanctuaries for cyber adversaries; changing US and adversary mindsets and expectations for what is permitted in cyberspace; changes to military planning in order to conduct operations in consideration of adversary cyber capability; and appreciation of the key policy tradeoffs with respect to <b>cyber</b> <b>deterrence</b> implementation.

40|$|Cyber threats pose a {{real and}} growing problem, and to date, United States efforts to counter them have lagged. While the ability to defend against an attack or {{intrusion}} must be maintained, the US, like any country, would be well served by deterring its adversaries from acting in the ﬁrst place – at least {{when it comes to}} the most serious of actions, namely cyber warfare. Clearly not all hostile behavior can be deterred, but it is important to identify priorities in this regard and determine how best to address those that lead the list. Despite animated discussions, development of a grand uniﬁed solution has remained elusive, in part because the complexity and crosscutting nature of <b>cyber</b> <b>deterrence</b> requires a comprehensive and cohesive solution that encompasses stakeholders in both the private and public sectors...|$|E
40|$|Operations in {{cyberspace}} are enabled by a digitized battlefield. The {{ability to control}} operations {{in cyberspace}} has become a central goal for defence forces. As a result, terms like cyber power, cyberspace operations and <b>cyber</b> <b>deterrence</b> have begun to emerge in military literature {{in an effort to}} describe and highlight the importance of related activities. Future military personnel, in all branches, will encounter the raised complexity of joint military operations with cyber as the key enabler.

40|$|On 4 - 6 May 2011 the Esonian Ministry of Defense hosted and co-sponsored a {{workshop}} in Tallinn concerning {{the challenges of}} adapting NATO's deterrence posture {{in light of the}} neew Strategic Concept approved at the November Lisbon Summit. The workshop focused on issues likely to figure in the NATO Deterrence and Defense Posture Review (DDPR) commissioned at the Lisbon Summit. The main points raised in the discussion were as follows: The Alliance's deterrence and defense posture should be strengthened not only in order to prevent aggression against the Allies but also in view of their responsibilities outside the NATO area. While the NATO allies choose for multiple reasons not to name publicly the objects of their deterrence efforts, they should be frank in their internal deliberations. The DDPR will examine the full range of capabilities, but it must look beyond capabilities to the political dimension of <b>deterrence.</b> <b>Cyber</b> capabilities pose an array of unprecedented and unresolved challenges for NATO deterrence strategy and operations. The Alliance's deterrence and defense policy should encompass space security issues [...] .

40|$|Acquiring and {{exploiting}} {{information is}} key to remaining competitive in cyberspace. Security seesaws between informational advantage and vulnerability and America, as all other cyber-powers, must consistently tip the seesaw towards the former. Optimally managing the short term vulnerabilities of a cyber advantage will best produce a long-term net gain in security for the US. The Internet’s lax architecture favours offensive over defensive information seeking. Finding and buying zero-days supplements America’s security innovations to maintain a deployable cyber arsenal. <b>Cyber</b> <b>deterrence</b> is problematic so America relies on resilience to manage cyber attacks. Defence through attack absorption offers a better strategy than deterrence per se. Strategically sharing capabilities enables the United States to influence Five Eyes intelligence priorities while enabling its global cyber operations. Amassing an information advantage thus enables America to leverage information as power to enhance its net security posture...|$|E
40|$|With the U. S. {{government}} {{acknowledgement of}} the seriousness of cyber threats, particularly against its critical infrastructures, as well as the Department of Defense officially labeling cyberspace as a war fighting domain, the Cold War strategy of deterrence is being applied to the cyber domain. However, unlike the nuclear realm, <b>cyber</b> <b>deterrence</b> must incorporate a wide spectrum of potential adversaries of various skill, determination, and capability, ranging from individual actors to state run enterprises. What’s more, the very principles that achieved success in deterring the launch of nuclear weapons during the Cold War, namely the threat of severe retaliation, cannot be achieved in cyberspace, thus neutralizing the potential effectiveness of leveraging a similar strategy. Attribution challenges, the ability to respond quickly and effectively, and the ability to sustain a model of repeatability prove to be insurmountable in a domain where actors operate in obfuscation. ...|$|E
40|$|This timely Research Handbook {{contains}} {{an analysis by}} leading scholars and practitioners of various legal questions concerning cyberspace and cyber activities. Comprehensive and thorough, it succeeds in mapping out the range of international rules that apply to cyberspace and to specific cyber activities, assesses their regulatory efficacy and offers insightful suggestions, where necessary, for revised standards. Contributors examine the application of fundamental international law principles to cyberspace such as the principle of sovereignty, jurisdiction, state responsibility, individual criminal responsibility, human rights and intellectual property rights. They explore the application of international rules to cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, cyber crime, cyber attacks and to cyber war. They deal with the meaning of cyber operations, the ethics of cyber operations {{as well as with}} <b>cyber</b> <b>deterrence.</b> Finally, they comment on the cyber security policies of international and regional institutions such as those of the United Nations, the European Union, NATO and of Asian-Pacific institutions. This Research Handbook will benefit scholars in the fields of international law, international relations, public and private law. Researchers will find the suggested future research avenues in this field invaluable whilst policy-makers and practitioners will gain fresh insights into topical issues concerning the regulation of cyberspace and of cyber activities.
