5|$|In {{addition}} to the telerecorded material, some early 1970s material survives only, or in colour only, on NTSC videotapes produced for North American transmission (e.g., TV Ontario and CKVU in Vancouver). NTSC runs at a different framerate than PAL video, and has a different number of scanlines. The <b>conversion</b> <b>process</b> used in the 1970s was primitive by modern standards, resulting in a noticeable amount of picture and motion loss. Converting the NTSC tapes back to PAL introduces more artifacts, creating a blurry picture and juddering motion. To rectify the problem, in 2005 a new Reverse Standards <b>Conversion</b> <b>process,</b> which attempts to unpick the original video conversion, was introduced for the DVD release of The Claws of Axos.|$|E

Gneisenau was disarmed and her 28cm and 15cm gun turrets were used in shore batteries. Turret Caesar was installed in a coastal fortress in Trondheim as the coastal battery Orlandet.|$|E
5|$|The 767-200 ceased {{production}} in the late 1980s, superseded by the extended-range 767-200ER. Some early 767-200s were subsequently upgraded to extended-range specification.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} extent to which different knowledge <b>conversion</b> <b>processes</b> require different kinds of leadership. The research was inspired by Nonaka and Konno (1998) and proposed that knowledge <b>conversion</b> <b>processes</b> may each require their own form of leadership because they are conducted under different bas or contexts. Vera and Crossan's (2004) work provided a foundation for this research through the argument that knowledge <b>conversion</b> <b>processes</b> need not only transformational but also transactional leadership. The leadership framework based upon transformational and transactional leadership was therefore adopted for the study. Semi-structured interviews and the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ), developed by Bernard Bass and Bruce Avolio to assess leadership under the transformational and transactional leadership framework, were used to gauge the opinions of participants about leadership and knowledge <b>conversion</b> <b>processes.</b> Scenarios/descriptions derived from Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) were used to focus the mindset of the participants involved in the interviews and the questionnaire, which was administered {{at the time of the}} interviews to support triangulation. Findings suggested that knowledge <b>conversion</b> <b>processes</b> do not differ to the extent that they require both transformational and transactional leadership. However, qualitative evidence indicated that knowledge <b>conversion</b> <b>processes</b> were somewhat different in terms of certain dimensions of transformational leadership. These differences related to the need for a strong sense of purpose, a compelling vision of the future and long-termism in some but not all situations involving the leadership of knowledge <b>conversion</b> <b>processes.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, {{not to mention the}} new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound <b>conversion</b> <b>process</b> and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point. These economic circumstances led to a loss of nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression.

5|$|In 1994, the Nuclear Posture Review study {{determined}} that, of the 18 Ohio SSBNs the U.S. Navy {{would be}} operating in total, 14 {{would be sufficient}} for the strategic needs of the U.S. The {{decision was made to}} convert four Ohio-class boats into SSGNs capable of conducting conventional land attack and special operations. As a result, the four oldest boats of the class—Ohio, Michigan, Florida, and Georgia—progressively entered the <b>conversion</b> <b>process</b> in late 2002 and were returned to active service by 2008. The boats could thereafter carry 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 66 special operations personnel, among other capabilities and upgrades.

Work on Jade was not started and the conversion project was abandoned in November 1942. She returned to service as a troopship, only to be sunk by a mine in the western Baltic. Elbe actually began the <b>conversion</b> <b>process</b> in December 1942, but only her passenger fittings were removed by the time work was halted in February 1943. She was converted into a barracks ship in Gotenhafen and seized by the United Kingdom {{after the end of}} the war. She remained in use until 1976, when she was broken up for scrap. A third ocean liner of the same class, , was purchased by the Imperial Japanese Navy and converted into the escort carrier Shin'yō. Shin'yō was torpedoed and sunk in the East China Sea by a United States Navy submarine.|$|E
