5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
5|$|Excess heat can {{be removed}} by {{immersion}} of the cylinder in a <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> bath while filling. However, immersion for cooling can also {{increase the risk of}} water contaminating the valve orifice of a completely depressurized tank and being blown into the cylinder during filling.|$|E
5|$|The atoll is {{populated}} by {{several species of}} birds, fish and reptiles. In the lagoon, sparse living coral still can be found; the dominant species is Montipora bilaminata (family Acroporidae). Most of the coral in the lagoon is dead, presumed to {{have been killed by}} influxes of <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Flemish Cap {{is located}} within {{an area of}} {{transition}} between the <b>cold</b> <b>waters</b> of the Labrador Current and warmer waters influenced by the Gulf Stream. The mixing of the warmer and <b>colder</b> <b>waters</b> over the plateau produces the characteristic clockwise circulation current over the cap.|$|R

5|$|This {{life cycle}} {{consists}} of several stages. The first stage is the submarine preshield stage, currently represented solely by Lōʻihi Seamount. During this stage, the volcano builds height through increasingly frequent eruptions. The sea's pressure prevents explosive eruptions. The <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> quickly solidifies the lava, producing the pillow lava that {{is typical of}} underwater volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium is a soft, {{malleable}} and ductile {{chemical element}} that displays a bright silvery luster when pure. It {{is a rare}} earth element, and it is readily dissolved by the strong mineral acids. It reacts slowly with <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> and it oxidizes slowly in air.|$|E
5|$|As Norway gained full {{independence}} in 1905, {{the national government}} determined to establish institutions consistent with the newly formed state's ambitions as a modern society. The first prime minister made it a priority to modernize the Royal Palace in Oslo, building among other things, some of the country's first water toilets, providing hot and <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> and granting the Royal Family's wish of providing a common apartment for the king, queen, and their son.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>water</b> {{fishing is}} {{available}} in Black Moshannon Creek and several of its tributaries, where anglers will find rainbow and brown trout that have been stocked there for sport fishing by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Black Moshannon Lake's waters are warmer {{than those of the}} creek, and so hold many different species of fish, including largemouth bass, muskellunge, yellow perch, chain pickerel, bullhead catfish, northern pike, bluegill, and crappie.|$|E
5|$|Commercially {{prepared}} old-fashioned doughnut batter mixes are mass-produced in the United States, {{which may}} be prepared by simply adding <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> to the mix. Prepared mixes are used by some doughnut shops. Doughnut shops may prepare old-fashioned doughnuts by loading the batter into the hopper of a doughnut maker, which upon turning a hand crank, drops a formed doughnut into a deep fryer. Doughnut makers are also used for other doughnut varieties, such as cake doughnuts, yeast doughnuts, cream filled, and jelly filled doughnuts.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{from new}} superpredators, such as macropredatory sperm whales which {{appeared}} in the Miocene, and killer whales and great white sharks in the Pliocene, may have also contributed to the decline and extinction of megalodon. Fossil records indicate that the new whale-eating cetaceans commonly occurred at high latitudes during the Pliocene, indicating that they could cope with the increasingly prevalent <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> temperatures; but they also occurred in the tropics (e.g., Orcinus sp. in South Africa).|$|E

5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much {{has been written}} about the level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E
5|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn {{increases the risk of}} other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high ambient pressure adds further complications, both directly and indirectly. Technological solutions have been developed which can greatly extend depth and duration of human ambient pressure dives, and allow useful {{work to be done}} underwater.|$|E

5|$|In <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> diving, where a diver {{wearing a}} highly buoyant {{thermally}} insulating dive suit {{has a large}} excess of buoyancy, steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders. They also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of steel cylinders can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by the diver.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Catawissa Creek {{was found by}} the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to have good {{temperatures}} for trout habitation, {{but there was no}} aquatic life in the creek due to acid mine drainage. This situation continued through the 1960s and 1970s. However, by 1997, large populations of wild trout were found on some tributaries of Catawissa Creek. As of 2003, Catawissa Creek {{is considered to be a}} cold-water fishery between its headwaters and its confluence with Rattling Run. Several other tributaries, namely Dark Run, Davis Run, Little Catawissa Creek, and Messers Run are designated as high-quality <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps {{protect them from the}} <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. When they walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{imperial}} {{family was}} a frequent target for assassins, so for safety reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of Gatchina, about 50miles (80km) west of Saint Petersburg. Olga and her siblings, however, were not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle. Conditions in the nursery were modest, even Spartan. They slept on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, washed in <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> and ate a simple porridge for breakfast.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} glacier retreat on the park's {{ecosystems}} {{is not fully}} known, but {{plant and animal species}} that are dependent on <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> could suffer due to a loss of habitat. Reduced seasonal melting of glacial ice may also affect stream flow during the dry summer and fall seasons, reducing water table levels and increasing the risk of forest fires. The loss of glaciers will also reduce the aesthetic visual appeal that glaciers provide to visitors.|$|E
5|$|To prevent {{contagion}} and {{to preserve}} health, all employees {{should be involved}} in keeping the factory clean. Children should bathe occasionally. The clothes of those infected with fever should be washed in <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> then in hot and be left to fumigate before being worn again. Those who died of fever should be wrapped promptly in cloth and those in the vicinity advised to smoke tobacco to avoid infection.|$|E
