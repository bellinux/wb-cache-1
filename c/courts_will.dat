5|$|The <b>courts</b> <b>will,</b> of course, {{decline to}} hold that Parliament has {{interfered}} with fundamental rights unless it has made its intentions crystal clear. The <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> treat with particular suspicion (and might even reject) any attempt to subvert {{the rule of law}} by removing governmental action affecting the rights of the individual from all judicial scrutiny.|$|E
5|$|Another {{exception}} to the general rule that <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> generally only judicially review errors of law is where action is taken or a decision is {{made on the basis}} of no evidence, a lack of sufficient evidence, or an error of material fact. In such situations, intervention by the High Court is warranted as the action or decision is factually unsustainable.|$|E
5|$|In addition, it {{also appears}} that an applicant's {{subjective}} motivation {{is relevant to}} {{whether he or she}} should be recognized as having public standing. If a case is brought out of ill-will or some other improper purpose, the <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> be reluctant to recognize that the applicant has standing, even if there is a public interest in the case being heard.|$|E

[...] "This new specialist <b>court</b> <b>will</b> deliver a system of military justice for ADF members that combines the necessary independence and constitutional protections for the judiciary {{with an understanding of}} the vital importance of military discipline in the operation of our armed forces", he said. [...] "Timely and fair trials in the new <b>court</b> <b>will</b> enhance military justice and promote discipline in the ADF, which in turn will contribute to improved morale and operational effectiveness.|$|R

50|$|In {{evaluating}} a {{safe harbor}} defense under the DMCA, a <b>court</b> <b>will</b> first evaluate whether {{the party has}} met a set of three threshold criteria. The <b>court</b> <b>will</b> then decide whether the party has fulfilled {{the requirements of the}} safe harbor protection it invokes.|$|R
5|$|On November 21, the California {{lawsuit was}} dropped {{in order to}} merge with the Minnesota lawsuit. Boies hoped that the move would {{speed up the process}} since the <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> likely merge the suits as they are similar {{complaints}} seeking the same outcome.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedural}} {{dimension of}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation has been recognized by Singapore courts and, since 2013, the substantive form of the doctrine as well. However, whether the <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> adopt the UK approach with regard to measuring legitimate expectation with the ruler of proportionality remains an open question.|$|E
5|$|A partial ouster or {{time limit}} clause {{specifies}} a restricted period, after which no remedy will be available. Such clauses are generally effective, unless the public authority has acted in bad faith. Similarly, {{the existence of}} bad faith entitles applicants to challenge decisions of authorities despite the existence of statutory provisions declaring such decisions to be conclusive evidence of certain facts. In the absence of bad faith, the <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> enforce conclusive evidence clauses.|$|E
5000|$|If the charge(s) is {{a summary}} offence, the <b>court</b> <b>will</b> {{generally}} expect {{a plea to}} be taken. If the plea is one of [...] "not guilty", the <b>Court</b> <b>will</b> fix a date for trial, {{taking into account the}} number and availability of the witnesses.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} {{of the ruling}} in Anisminic, it appears {{that there may be}} {{instances}} where the <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide. Cane has noted that there are three views. The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E
5|$|Lim Chin Leng has {{opined that}} Taw Cheng Kong stands as {{authority}} for {{the proposition that the}} Singapore <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> apply in domestic law the rules and principles of public international law that have previously been received into the common law. The Court of Appeal recognized a rule of customary international law that had been received into the common law, that is, the presumption against extraterritoriality, and ascribed to Parliament the intent to uphold that rule for the purposes of construing a statutory provision.|$|E
5|$|Tham Chee Ho contends that, {{based on}} the {{objective}} test set out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced. This is because the courts do not review the actions taken by the executive for national security purposes, but merely determine whether the situation in fact involves national security issues. The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment.|$|E

50|$|An {{unenforceable}} contract or transaction {{is one that}} is valid but one the <b>court</b> <b>will</b> not enforce. Unenforceable is usually used in contradistinction to void (or void ab initio) and voidable. If the parties perform the agreement, it will be valid, but the <b>court</b> <b>will</b> not compel them if they do not.|$|R
2500|$|Justice Brandeis {{summarized}} four general {{guidelines that}} the Supreme Court uses to avoid constitutional decisions relating to Congress: The <b>Court</b> <b>will</b> not anticipate {{a question of}} constitutional law nor decide open questions unless a case decision requires it. If it does, a rule of constitutional law is formulated only as the precise facts in the case require. The <b>Court</b> <b>will</b> choose statutes or general law for {{the basis of its}} decision if it can without constitutional grounds. If it does, the <b>Court</b> <b>will</b> choose a constitutional construction of an Act of Congress, even if its constitutionality is seriously in doubt.|$|R
5|$|The Saudi {{system of}} justice {{has been criticized for}} being slow, arcane, lacking in some of the {{safeguards}} of justice and unable to deal with the modern world. In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees with the aim of reforming the judiciary and creating a new court system. The reforms have yet to be implemented in full but, once they are, will include the creation of a Supreme Court and the transfer of the Board of Grievances' commercial and criminal jurisdictions to a restructured general court system. New specialist first instance <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> be established comprising general, criminal, personal status, commercial and labor courts. The Sharia <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> therefore lose their general jurisdiction to hear all cases and the work load of the government's administrative tribunals will be transferred to the new courts. Another important change is the establishment of appeal courts for each province. It has been claimed that the reforms will establish a system for codifying Sharia and incorporating the principle of judicial precedent into court practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of fairness. English courts developed this doctrine largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers. Generally, the <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative decision based on an individual's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The individual has {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E

25|$|The 1949 Act {{could be}} {{considered}} to be secondary legislation, since it depended for its validity on another Act, the 1911 Act; and the principle that <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> respect an Act of Parliament without enquiring into its origins (an emanation of parliamentary sovereignty) would not apply.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{illustrates the}} courts' reluctance {{to give effect to}} any legislative provision {{that attempts to}} exclude their jurisdiction in judicial review. Even when such an exclusion is relatively clearly worded, the <b>courts</b> <b>will</b> hold that it does not preclude them from scrutinising the decision on an error of law and quashing it when such an error occurs.|$|E
