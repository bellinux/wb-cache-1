40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to histomorphometrically {{evaluate}} the influence of interimplant distances (ID) and implant placement depth on bone remodeling around contiguous Morse <b>cone</b> <b>connection</b> implants with `platform-shifting` in a dog model. Material and methods Bilateral mandibular premolars of six dogs were extracted, and after 12 weeks, each dog received 8 implants, four placed 1. 5 mm subcrestally (SCL) on one side of the mandible and four placed equicrestally (ECL) on the other side, alternating the ID of 2 and 3 mm. The experimental groups were SCL with IDs of 2 mm (2 SCL) and 3 mm (3 SCL) and ECL with IDs of 2 mm (2 ECL) and 3 mm (3 ECL). Metallic crowns were immediately installed. After 8 weeks, the animals were euthanized and histomorphometric analyses were performed to compare bone remodeling in the groups. Results The SCL groups` indices of crestal bone resorption were significantly lower than those of ECL groups. In addition, the vertical bone resorption around the implants was also numerically inferior in the SCL groups, but without statistical significance. No differences were obtained between the different IDs. All the groups presented similar good levels of bone-to-implant contact and histological bone density. Conclusion The subcrestal placement of contiguous Morse <b>cone</b> <b>connection</b> implants with `platform shifting` was more efficient in preserving the interimplant crestal bone. The IDs of 2 and 3 mm did not affect the bone remodeling significantly under the present conditions. To cite this article:Barros RRM, Novaes AB Jr., Muglia VA, Iezzi G, Piattelli A.

40|$|Objective: Stable crestal bone {{levels are}} {{believed}} to be critical for the long-term implant success. After implant insertion and loading, crestal bone usually remodels to a level about 2. 0 mm apical to the the implant–abutment junction in two-piece implants. This could be lead to a localized inflammation of the peri-implant tissues. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the clinical outcomes of <b>cone</b> <b>connection</b> implants and zirconia restorations on peri-implant tissues. Methods: 91 Morse <b>cone</b> <b>connection</b> implants (Ankylos® Dentsply Friadent, Mannheim, Germany) were inserted in 53 patients, ranging in age between 27 and 65 years old, to correct partial or single edentulisms. After an healing period of 2 months, the implants were loaded, for 1 month with resin provisional prosthesis and then with Zirconia core fixed partial dentures and were monitorized every 3 months for 2 years. The crestal bone height was evaluated with digital standardized radiographs; mSBI, mPlI, suppuration or gingival enlargment were recorded to study soft tissue conditions. Results: Mean crestal bone loss at interproximal surfaces was ≤ 0, 5 mm. Stable bone above the implant shoulder was detected in case of subcrestal positioning of the implant. No infrabony pockets were present. mPlI≤ 1 and mSBI≤ 1 were recorded regardless of patient smoking or hygene habits; no suppurations or gingival enlargments were observed. Conclusions: It has been claimed that morse tapered abutment connection provides high resistance to micromotion and bacteria infiltration and that Zirconia provocs lower inflammatory level in surrounding tissues than titanium.

The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate bacterial leakage from human saliva to the internal part of the implants along the implant-abutment interface under loaded and unloaded conditions using DNA Checkerboard. Materials and Methods: Sixty denial implants- 20 each of external-hexagon, internal-hexagon, and Morse cone-connection designs-and their conical abutments were used in this study. Each group was subdivided into two groups of 10 loaded and 10 unloaded implants. The assemblies were immersed in human saliva and either (1) loaded with 500, 000 cycles at 120 N (experimental group) or (2) incubated in static conditions for 7 days at 35 degrees C (unloaded control group). Results: Microorganisms were found in the internal surfaces of all types of <b>connections.</b> The Morse <b>cone</b> <b>connection</b> presented the lowest count of microorganisms in both the unloaded and loaded groups. Loaded implants presented with higher counts of microorganisms than unloaded implants for external- and internal-hex connections. Conclusion: Bacterial species from human saliva may penetrate along the implant-abutment interface under both unloaded and loaded conditions for all connections evaluated. Morse cone-connection implants showed the lowest counts of microorganisms for both conditions. External- and internal-hex implants showed a higher incidence of bacteria and higher bacterial counts after simulated loading. INT J ORAL MAXILLOFAC IMPLANTS 2012; 27 : 551 - 560.

Ondřej Honzl E-mail Address: honzl@karlin. mff. cuni. cz Department: Department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics Supervisor: Prof. RNDr. Jan Rataj, CSc. E-mail Address: rataj@karlin. mff. cuni. cz Department: Mathematical Institute, Charles University Abstract: Our {{thesis is}} focused on certain {{geometric}} properties of Brownian motion paths. Firstly, it deals with cone points of Brownian motion in the plane and we show some <b>connections</b> between <b>cone</b> points and critical points of Brownian motion. The motivation {{of the study of}} critical points is provided by a pleasant behavior of the distance function outside of the set of these points. We prove the theorem on a non-existence of π+ cone points on fixed line. This statement leads us to the conjecture that there are only countably many critical points of the Brownian motion path in the plane. Next, the thesis discusses an asymptotic behavior of the surface area of r-neigh- bourhood of Brownian motion, which is called Wiener sausage. Using the proper- ties of a Kneser function, we prove the claim about the relation of the Minkowski content and S-content. As the consequence, we obtain a limit behavior of the surface area of the Wiener sausage almost surely in dimension d ≥ 3. Finally, [...] ...|$|R

Three types of cone horizontal cells were observed in Golgi preparations and they were called HI, H 2, and H 3 type cells, according to their morphological characteristics. Analysis of cone-horizontal cell contacts,, revealed that HI cells contact red sensitive twin cones and green sensitive single cones, H 2 cells contact red sensitive twin cones exclusively, and H 3 cells contact exclusively green sensitive single <b>cones.</b> Inter <b>connections</b> of <b>cones</b> by basal processes were also examined; single cone basal processes were found to contact twin cone pedicles, and twin cone basal processes to contact other twin cone pedicles. The spectral sensitivity and spatial organization of horizontal cells were analysed by intracellular recordings. Two types of horizontal cell responses were observed; L-type responses that hyper polarized to light stimuli of all wavelengths, and R/G C-type responses that depolarized to red and hyperpolarized to green stimuli. Correlation of anatomical and morphological results suggests that HI and H 2 cells generate L-type responses, and H 3 cells generate R/G C-type responses. The R/G cells are hyperpolarized by signals from the green (P 5352) sensitive cones and depolarized by a far red (650 - 670 nm) mechanism. Compared with the red cone pigment (P 6 I 52), the L-type horizontal cell spectral sensitivity curve is narrow and with maximum (650 nm) displaced towards the red {{end of the spectrum}} (a pseudopigment spectral sensitivity curve), suggesting that an antagonistic interaction occurs between the two cone types, generating the horizontal cell spectral sensitivity function...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{establish}} neuronal {{connections in}} the rod and cone pathway between laminated rabbit retinal transplants and the host retina. METHODS: Fourteen adult rabbits received a complete full-thickness embryonic transplant. After survival times of 3 to 10 months, the retinas were studied under light microscope and with immunohistochemistry. Antibodies against protein kinase C (PKC), parvalbumin, and calbindin were used to label rod bipolar cells, AII amacrine cells, and cone bipolar cells, respectively. The AB 5 antibody was used to label ganglion cells. RESULTS: The transplants displayed laminated morphology with layers parallel to the host retinal pigment epithelium. In the oldest specimens (10 months after surgery), laminated layers of graft and host approached each other and almost reconstructed the normal retinal appearance. The ganglion and cone bipolar cells of the host survived well, as was seen with AB 5 and calbindin double-labeling. <b>Connections</b> between <b>cone</b> bipolar cells in the graft and ganglion cells in the host were not common. PKC-labeled rod bipolar cells and parvalbumin-labeled AII amacrine cells of host and graft showed sprouting activity directed toward an intermediate plexiform layer located between the graft and host. In specimens double-labeled with PKC and parvalbumin, this intermediate plexiform layer was seen to contain numerous PKC- and parvalbumin-labeled processes. Direct connections between rod bipolar and AII amacrine cells in host and graft were seen in the 10 -month specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Full-thickness embryonic transplants survive for at least 10 months, and normal laminated morphology develops. Host and graft fuse and together contribute nerve cell processes to an intermediate plexiform layer. Direct graft-host contacts are also present between neuronal types that in the normal retina participate in the rod pathway...|$|R

Although 2 DDirac materials possess many novel properties and physics, they are rare compared with the numerous 2 Dmaterials. To provide explanation for the rarity of 2 DDirac materials as well as clues in searching for new Dirac systems, here we review the recent theoretical aspects of various 2 DDirac materials, including graphene, silicene, germanene, graphynes, several boron and carbon sheets, transition-metal oxides (VO 2) n/(TiO 2) m and (CrO 2) n/(TiO 2) m, organic and organometallic crystals, so-MoS 2, and artificial lattices (electron gases and ultracold atoms). Their structural and electronic properties are summarized. We also investigate how Dirac points emerge, move, and merge in these systems. The von Neumann–Wigner theorem is used to explain the scarcity of Dirac cones in 2 D systems, which leads to rigorous requirements on the symmetry, parameters, Fermi level, and band overlap of materials to achieve Dirac <b>cones.</b> <b>Connections</b> between existence of Dirac cones and the structural features are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Retinal bipolar cells {{comprise}} {{a diverse group}} of neurons. Cone bipolar cells and rod bipolar cells are so named for their <b>connections</b> with <b>cone</b> and rod photoreceptors, respectively. Morphological criteria have been established that distinguish nine types of cone bipolar cells and one type of rod bipolar cell in mouse and rat. While anatomical and physiological aspects of bipolar types have been actively studied, {{little is known about the}} sequence of events that leads to bipolar cell type specification and the potential relationship this process may have with synapse formation in the outer plexiform layer. In this study, we have examined the birth order of rod and cone bipolar cells in the developing mouse and rat in vivo. Results Using retroviral lineage analysis with the histochemical marker alkaline phosphatase, the percentage of cone and rod bipolar cells born on postnatal day 0 (P 0), P 4, and P 6 were determined, based upon the well characterized morphology of these cells in the adult rat retina. In this in vivo experiment, we have demonstrated that cone bipolar genesis clearly precedes rod bipolar genesis. In addition, in the postnatal mouse retina, using a combination of tritiated-thymidine birthdating and immunohistochemistry to distinguish bipolar types, we have similarly found that cone bipolar genesis precedes rod bipolar genesis. The tritiated-thymidine birthdating studies also included quantification of the birth of all postnatally generated retinal cell types in the mouse. Conclusion Using two independent in vivo methodologies in rat and mouse retina, we have demonstrated that there are distinct waves of genesis of the two major bipolar cell types, with cone bipolar genesis preceding rod bipolar genesis. These waves of bipolar genesis correspond to the order of genesis of the presynaptic photoreceptor cell types. </p...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} morphologic {{alterations in}} the retina {{of the visual}} mutant zebrafish gantenbein (gnn) and to examine whether these alterations correlate with those present in human hereditary eye diseases. METHODS: The gnn mutant was isolated by behavioral and macroscopic screening. Retinas of gnn zebrafish larvae were examined at different developmental stages from 2 to 9 days postfertilization (dpf) by standard histologic staining techniques and by immunocytochemistry. Ultrastructural alterations were examined by electron microscopy. The genetic map position of the induced mutation was identified by mapping with two candidate primer pairs on single larvae. RESULTS: The gnn mutant exhibited shortened outer photoreceptor segments and altered RPE morphology. In the photoreceptor layer of the mutant, {{the total number of}} lectin-labeled cones was reduced in all developmental stages from 2 to 7 dpf, whereas the amount of rhodopsin-positive cells remained at the wild-type (WT) level. Labeling with zebrafish opsin antibodies revealed dystrophic red cones at 5 dpf, whereas the morphology of all other cone types was largely unaffected. Electron microscopy unveiled electron-dense deposits between the discs of the double cone outer segments. In addition, the onset of progressive RPE degeneration was observed at this stage of development. At later stages, all cone types and the RPE became degenerative. The morphology of distinct second-order neurons remained largely unaffected by the mutation. The gnn mutation was located approximately 4. 3 cM from the simple sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) marker Z 15453 on linkage group 16. CONCLUSIONS: In gnn mutant zebrafish, cones, and especially red cones, are dystrophic in early retinal development. Subsequent to this cone dystrophy, the RPE becomes dysfunctional and starts to degenerate in later stages of development. Thus, the early developmental morphology of gnn exhibits similarities to cone dystrophies most commonly seen in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) among humans, whereas the later stages of degeneration in gnn resemble RPE alterations in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in humans. The gnn zebrafish mutant may therefore be a useful model for examining the possible interplay and <b>connection</b> between <b>cone</b> dystrophy and RPE degeneration...|$|R

METHODS. Double-label immunocytochemistry, using antibodies directed against short-wavelength (S) - and middle- to long-wavelength (M/L) -sensitive opsin {{were used to determine}} the presence of visual pigments in cones of two species of rodents, the Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus) and the pouched Mouse (Saccostomus campestris) from South Africa. Topographical distribution was determined from retinal whole-mounts. and the colocalization of visual pigments was examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Opsin colocalization was also confirmed in consecutive semithin tangential sections. RESULTS. The immunocytochemical results demonstrate that in both the Siberian hamster and the pouched mouse all retinal cones contain two visual pigments. No dorsoventral gradient in the differential expression of the two opsins is observed. CONCLUSIONS. The retina of the Siberian hamster and the pouched mouse is the first example to show a uniform coexpression of M and S cone opsins in all cones, without any topographical gradient in opsin expression. This finding makes these two species good models for the study of molecular control mechanisms in opsin coexpression in rodents, and renders them suitable as sources of dual cones for future investigations on the role and neural <b>connections</b> of this <b>cone</b> type...|$|R

Bilateral mandibular premolars of 6 dogs were extracted, and after 12 weeks, the implants were placed. Four experimental groups were constituted: subcrestally with ID of 2 mm (2 SCL) and 3 mm (3 SCL) and crestally with ID of 2 mm (2 CL) and 3 mm (3 CL). Metallic crowns were immediately installed with a distance of 3 mm between the contact point and the bone crest.

40|$|Horizontal cells invaginate the photoreceptors in {{the retina}} and form {{reciprocal}} synaptic <b>connections</b> in the <b>cone</b> pedicles. In fish retina {{the pattern of}} synaptic connections is plastic and modulated by the ambient light conditions. Numerous dendritic spinules protrude from the terminal horizontal-cell dendrites into the cone pedicle when the retina is light-adapted and are retracted during dark adaptation. The retraction of spinules can be induced during maintained illumination by an injection of the putative cone transmitter L-glutamate or its analogue kainic acid into the vitreous humor. The formation and the retraction of spinules have a time course of minutes. Activation of protein kinase C through phorbol esters initiates the formation of spinules, but the retraction {{has not yet been}} linked to a specific second messenger. Herein we report that physiological concentrations of the glutamate analogs quisqualic acid and alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionic acid induce retraction of spinules during maintained illumination. (+/-) -trans- 1 -Amino- 1, 3 -cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid, an agonist for the metabotropic quisqualic acid receptor, was without effect on spinule retraction. N-Methyl-D-aspartate and L- 2 -amino- 4 -phosphonobutyric acid, agonists at other types of glutamate receptors, were also without any effect. The effects of the active agonists persisted when synaptic transmission was blocked. In the presence of the ionotropic quisqualate receptor antagonist 6 -cyclo- 7 -nitro-quinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione the effects of all active agonists were blocked.

40|$|Abstract. The {{growth cone}} must push its {{substrate}} rearward via some traction force {{in order to}} propel itself forward. To determine which growth cone behaviors produce traction force, we observed chick sensory growth cones under conditions in which force production was accommodated by movement of obstacles in the environment, namely, neurites of other sensory neurons or glass fibers. The movements of these obstacles occurred via three, different, stereotyped growth cone behaviors: (a) filopodial contractions, (b) smooth rearward movement on the dorsal surface of the growth cone, and (c) interactions with ruffling lamellipodia. More than 70 % of the obstacle movements were caused by filopodial contractions in which the obstacle attached at the extreme distal end of a filopodium and moved only as the filopodium changed its extension. Filopodial contractions were characterized by frequent changes of obstacle velocity and direction. Contraction of a single filopodium is estimated to exert 50 - 90 /~dyn of force, which can account for the pull exerted by chick sensory growth T hE growth and guidance of neurons depends on the growth cone, a highly motile cellular compartment at the distal end of axons and dendrites (Lockerbie, 1987; Smith, 1988; Bray and Hollenbeck, 1988). This motility is believed to reflect the general mechanisms of amoeboid-like, "crawling " by metazoan cells (Wessells, 1982; Trinkaus, 1985; Bray and White, 1988). However, the <b>connection</b> between growth <b>cone</b> locomotion and its complex behavior is poorly understood and somewhat controversial.

For these reasons, whole plant reconstructions are usually scarce and precious.

Calder and also with the tiny male cones of Masculostrobus altoensis Menéndez. In both cases, the typical morphology of A. sanctaecrucis was recognized in the leaves clothing the cones' peduncles and also in the base of the bracts and microsporophylls. Two whole plant reconstructions were made: the "Araucaria mirabilis tree" (Araucariaceae) and the "Pararaucaria patagonica tree" (Pararaucariaceae), solving the relations between previously described, world-wide known coniferous species and emphasizing the bispecific composition of the Jurassic forests in this area.

30|$|Although the {{reduction}} in RTVs was observed after mechanical cyclic loading, no screw loosening occurred after 2, 000, 000 [*]cycles of loading, which it assumed represents 3 [*]years of function in worse scenario setting according to ISO 14801 in vivo [23]. Our study presents similar results to those of Binon and McHugh, who reported that the 30 -N-cm insertion torque can maintain screw-joint stability in 3 [*]years of simulated function [34]. The reduction of screw preload after 2, 000, 000 [*]cycles of loading was 42.74 %. This {{is considered to be}} relatively low and might be because of the implant-abutment connection design [39]. The eccentric force has little effect on the screw preload under functional loading because the contacting part of the <b>cone</b> <b>connection</b> helps to provide frictional resistance and mechanical stability [7, 8]. Moreover, the Octatorx lobular anti-rotational design help produce little micromovement in the joint system under load [9]. The screw design also has an effect on the screw preload [39]. Paepoemsin et al. [31] found that the retaining tapered screws of their implants maintained higher preload efficiency than did the flat head screws of the implants before and after cyclic loading (P[*]<[*] 0.05). In our study, RTVs were constant from 50, 000 [*]cycles of loading to 1, 800, 000 [*]cycles. This result is not in agreement with those of Khraisat et al. [40], who concluded that 1, 000, 000 [*]cycles of loading significantly affected the RTVs of CeraOne abutment external hex implants compared with 500, 000 [*]cycles of loading. This might be because different types of implant-abutment connections were used. In external connections, implant-abutment stability is obtained primarily by the tension of the screws [4]. Therefore, the screw preload in external connections is affected by the cyclic loading more than in internal connections.|$|R
40|$|The {{color vision}} of Old World {{primates}} and humans uses two cone-opponent systems; one differences the outputs of L and M cones forming a red–green (RG) system, {{and the other}} differences S cones {{with a combination of}} L and M cones forming a blue–yellow (BY) system. In this paper, we show that in human vision these two systems have a differential distribution across the visual field. Cone contrast sensitivities for sine-wave grating stimuli (smoothly enveloped in space and time) were measured for the two color systems (RG & BY) and the achromatic (Ach) system at a range of eccentricities in the nasal field (0 – 25 deg). We spatially scaled our stimuli independently for each system (RG, BY, & Ach) in order to activate that system optimally at each eccentricity. This controlled for any differential variations in spatial scale with eccentricity and provided a comparison between the three systems under equivalent conditions. We find that while red–green cone opponency has a steep decline away from the fovea, the loss in blue–yellow cone opponency is more gradual, showing a similar loss to that found for achromatic vision. Thus only red–green opponency, and not blue–yellow opponency, can be considered a foveal specialization of primate vision with an overrepresentation at the fovea. In addition, statistical calculations of the level of chance cone opponency in the two systems indicate that selective S <b>cone</b> <b>connections</b> to postreceptoral neurons are essential to maintain peripheral blue–yellow sensitivity in human vision. In the red–green system, an assumption of cone selectivity is not required to account for losses in peripheral sensitivity. Overall, these results provide behavioral evidence for functionally distinct neuro-architectural origins of the two color systems in human vision, supporting recent physiological results in primates...|$|R
40|$|Serotiny is an {{important}} adaptation for plants in fire-prone environments. However, different mechanisms also induce the opening of serotinous cones {{in the absence of}} fire in variably serotinous species. Xeriscence -cone opening driven by dry and hot conditions- is considered to be mediated only by the external environment, but endogenous factors could also play a significant role. Using the variably serotinous Pinus halepensis as our model species, we determined the effects of cone age and scales density in cone opening, and using in-situ and ex-situ manipulative experiments we investigated the role of water availability in the opening of serotinous cones. We hypothesized that loss of <b>connection</b> between the <b>cones</b> and the branch through the peduncles or the absence of water supply could induce a faster cone opening. Results showed that older cones lost more water and opened at lower temperatures, with no influence of scales density. Both field and chamber manipulative experiments (using paired cones of the same whorl) confirmed that water intake through the peduncles affected significantly the pace of cone opening, such that lack of water supply speeded up cone dehiscence. However, this was true for weakly serotinous provenances-more common in this species-, while highly serotinous provenances were indifferent to this effect in the field test. All our results support that cone serotiny in P. halepensis involves the allocation of water to the cones, which is highly consistent with the previously observed environmental effects. Importantly, the existence of maintenance costs of serotinous cones has strong implications on the effects of climate change in the resilience of natural populations, via modifications of the canopy seed banks and recruitment after stand-replacing fires. Moreover, evolutionary models for serotiny in P. halepensis must take into account the significant contribution of maintenance costs to the complex interaction between genotype and the environment...|$|R
30|$|The occlusal force {{does not}} load {{only on the}} screw. The {{internal}} conical connection interface also helps to transfer and distribute the loading force to the implant [13]. The axial compressive component of occlusal force during oral function causes axial displacement of the abutment to the implant connection, increasing the frictional resistance and screw joint stability of the dental implant [7, 8]. Three factors {{that may lead to}} the axial displacement of the implant-abutment connection are machining tolerance, the wedge effect, and the settling effect. Firstly, machining tolerance is a dimensional variation characteristic of machined components. The precision of every implant component varies during manufacturing due to machining tolerance [14]. Secondly, the wedge effect occurs when tightening torque or loading force is applied to the abutment [15]. The abutment acts as a wedge transferring the axial force directly to the implant. Lastly, the settling effect occurs when rough spots on the contacting surfaces of the connection are flattened under load [16]. It causes the two surfaces to come closer together and leads to axial displacement. This axial displacement causes the length of the abutment screw to shorten, diminishing the screw preload [17]. The settling effect is the main cause of screw loosening. When the abutment is fastened to the implant body with the abutment screw, a settling phenomenon occurs in which the implant body and the abutment are deformed. Even if fastened at 30 [*]N[*]cm, depending on the implant system, the loosening torque becomes smaller than the 7 to 10 % fastening torque. After 5 [*]min from this point, it is necessary to loosen it twice [18]. The degree of settling depends on the surface roughness, surface hardness, and magnitude of the tightening torque and of the occlusal loading force [16]. On the one hand, the settling effect [17] causes the axial displacement leading to the decrease of the screw preload. On the other hand, the axial displacement causes the <b>cone</b> <b>connection</b> surface adaptation providing frictional resistance and screw-joint stability [7, 8].|$|R
40|$|The single-molar implant-supported {{restoration}} {{has historically}} presented {{a challenge in}} terms of form and function. The mesiodistal dimensions of a molar exceed that of most standard implants (3. 75 to 4 mm), creating the possibility of functional overload resulting in {{the failure of the}} retaining components or the failure of the implant. 1 Another result of these dimensional discrepancies affecting molar restorations on standard implants (Figs. 1 a, 1 b, 2 a, 2 b) is unfavourable contours leading to poor esthetics and hygiene. 2 In recent years, improvements in component stability have been derived from wider implant platforms, stronger screws, higher torque forces applied to retaining screws, larger hex designs on flat-top implants and the develop-ment of internal <b>connections</b> such as <b>cones,</b> internal hex and octagon configurations and combinations of these. These improvements have contributed to greater success with molar restoration. 3 Wide-diameter implants are limited in their ability to fit in bone receptor sites that are narrow buccolingually, and there have been reports of greater crestal bone loss compared to standard-diameter implants. 1 Additionally, most single-implant restorations on wider implants still tend to loosen, resulting in component failure. 3 In the posterior region of the oral cavity, bone volume and density are often compromised. Occlusal forces are greater in this region and, with or without parafunctional habits, can easily compromise the stability of the restorations. 4 Wider-diameter implants have a genuine use in smaller molar spaces (8 to 11 mm) with a crestal width {{greater than or equal to}} 8 mm. 1 Clinical parameters governing the proposed restoration should be carefully assessed in light of the availability of implants and components that provide a myriad of options in diameter, platform configurations and prosthetic connections. 3 Many of the newer systems for these restorations are showing promising results in recent clinical trials. 3, 5, 6 Most documentation in the recent litera-ture is for the Brånemark System, Astra Tech, ITI-Straumann and Endopore, and there is some for Friadent...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Modular neck {{adapters}} for hip arthroplasty stems {{allow the}} surgeon to modify CCD angle, offset and femoral anteversion intraoperatively. Fretting or crevice corrosion {{may lead to}} failure of such a modular device due to high loads or surface contamination inside the modular coupling. Unfortunately we have experienced such a failure of implants and now report our clinical experience with the failures in order to advance orthopaedic material research and joint replacement surgery. The failed neck adapters were implanted between August 2004 and November 2006 {{a total of about}} 5000 devices. After this period, the titanium neck adapters were replaced by adapters out of cobalt-chromium. Until the end of 2008 in total 1. 4 % (n = 68) of the implanted titanium alloy neck adapters failed with an average time of 2. 0 years (0. 7 to 4. 0 years) postoperatively. All, but one, patients were male, their average age being 57. 4 years (36 to 75 years) and the average weight 102. 3 kg (75 to 130 kg). The failures of neck adapters were divided into 66 % with small CCD of 130 ° and 60 % with head lengths of L or larger. Assuming an average time to failure of 2. 8 years, the cumulative failure rate was calculated with 2. 4 %. Methods A series of adapter failures of titanium alloy modular neck adapters in combination with a titanium alloy modular short hip stem was investigated. For patients having received this particular implant combination risk factors were identified which were associated with the occurence of implant failure. A Kaplan-Meier survival-failure-analysis was conducted. The retrieved implants were analysed using microscopic and chemical methods. Modes of failure were simulated in biomechanical tests. Comparative tests included modular neck adapters made of titanium alloy and cobalt chrome alloy material. Results Retrieval examinations and biomechanical simulation revealed that primary micromotions initiated fretting within the modular tapered neck connection. A continuous abrasion and repassivation process with a subsequent cold welding at the titanium alloy modular interface. Surface layers of 10 - 30 μm titanium oxide were observed. Surface cracks caused by fretting or fretting corrosion finally lead to fatigue fracture of the titanium alloy modular neck adapters. Neck adapters made of cobalt chrome alloy show significantly reduced micromotions especially in case of contaminated <b>cone</b> <b>connection.</b> With a cobalt-chromium neck the micromotions can be reduced by a factor of 3 compared to the titanium neck. The incidence of fretting corrosion was also substantially lower with the cobalt-chromium neck configuration. Conclusions Failure of modular titanium alloy neck adapters can be initiated by surface micromotions due to surface contamination or highly loaded implant components. In the present study, the patients at risk were men with an average weight over 100 kg. Modular cobalt chrome neck adapters provide higher safety compared to titanium alloy material. </p...|$|R
