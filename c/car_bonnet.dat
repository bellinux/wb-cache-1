500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Will Be" [...] {{was shot in}} New York City on 18 December 2008, and {{features}} Gossip Girl actor Chace Crawford {{as one of the}} characters. A reporter for People explained how the inclusion of Crawford in the video came to fruition, writing that [...] "Chace went to London a couple months ago for meetings and to promote Gossip Girl. He went to a party and ended up meeting Leona. [...] hit it off and talk {{every once in a while}} and have become fast friends. A couple weeks ago Leona called Chace and asked if he would be in her next video. He obviously said yes." [...] In the video, it is presumed that Lewis and Crawford have stolen a large amount of money, as it opens with dialogue between the pair and how they are going to try and arrange to meet each other at a later date, due to the police closing in on them. As the song begins to play, Lewis sings the first verse on the <b>car</b> <b>bonnet</b> in which they were shown sitting in previously. As she sings the first chorus, she stands up and faces Crawford in the car, and begins to walk away in a car park as she sings the second verse. For the second chorus, Lewis is shown to evade the police by trying to escape by car park stairways, but is confronted by policemen in most directions she goes. For the final chorus, Lewis makes it out onto the road and runs from the police in their cars, but is ultimately blocked from escape in all directions as they close in on her, arrest her, and place her in the back of a police car. People ranked the video as one of the most anticipated videos to be released in January 2009.|$|E

50|$|Between 2007 and 2009, Powell's focus {{shifted from}} landscapes to more social and {{political}} themes {{across a variety of}} mediums, genres and styles, including portraiture and installation. White Trash was a multimedia installation created out of discarded factory-made household objects found on the streets near his studio over a three-week period in 2007 and exhibited as part of a group exhibition on the theme of 'Contamination' (2007) at Gasworks Arts Park. The title of the work was a verbal pun on the environmental havoc caused by predominantly white Australians discarding unwanted household items in suburban streets. When asked if the assemblage of white and white painted found objects, including an old <b>car</b> <b>bonnet,</b> bedheads, cigarettes and discarded electrical items was a work of art, Powell described it more an expression of an appalling sense of waste in contemporary consumer society. When the exhibition ended, the installation was disassembled and the objects taken to the council waste facility in nearby Port Melbourne for disposal.|$|E
50|$|Carney {{applied to}} the NRL {{in an effort to}} play for an Australian club in the 2009 season but in January the NRL stated that they would not accept {{registration}} of a contract for Todd Carney for that season. In February 2009, Carney went on a vandalism spree in Goulburn, jumping on a <b>car</b> <b>bonnet</b> and damaging the entrance to a Fone Zone store. He received a 12-month suspended jail sentence, and was ordered to undertake alcohol counselling. In March 2009, the Canberra Raiders agreed to release Carney to play for the Atherton Roosters in the Cairns competition, in Far North Queensland. Carney was assaulted by four men in Atherton on 10 May 2009, with one of those men former Cowboys, Broncos & current London Broncos player Nick Slyney. Carney reportedly injured a man by setting his pants on fire in an incident on New Year's Eve. A man suffered burns to his buttock, scrotum and upper thighs after allegedly having his pants set alight while on holiday at Airlie Beach in Queensland. The police did not investigate the incident, with the man making no formal complaint. However this was not a good start to his Sydney Roosters career, after the club had just handed him a career lifeline by signing him to a three-year deal.|$|E

By 1975, the 1600M and 3000M were being built without the vents but they were retained on the 2500M due to its tendency to run hot.|$|R

50|$|The {{cars that}} form the baboon's head were given to Picasso's son Claude Picasso in 1951 by the art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. As Françoise later explained, Claude as an infant had a {{tendency}} to break his toys with a hammer, but the cars remained whole until his father borrowed them later in 1951. Picasso placed one car on top of the other, with their undersides together. On top was a model of a Panhard Dyna X, with its windscreen forming the baboon's eyes, and the <b>car's</b> <b>bonnet</b> for the nose. Underneath was an upside-down Renault, reversed so its boot is the baboon's lower jaw.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2007, Kevin {{agrees to}} sell cars for Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), unaware they are stolen. When he discovers this, he agrees to {{continue}} selling {{them as he}} wants money for a new house for his family, and a round the world trip for Deano. Phil later learns from Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) that the cars are dangerous [...] "cut-and-shuts" [...] and tells Kevin {{to get rid of}} them. However, Denise has sold one of the cars to Yolande Trueman (Angela Wynter), so on New Year's Eve 2007, Kevin tries to steal Yolande's car and destroy it. His plans are jeopardized by Shirley, who threatens to tell the police unless he persuades Carly to talk to her. Unable to get rid of Shirley, Kevin throws her into the car, planning to take it to a junkyard. However, the car is low on petrol and they are unable to get to their destination, so Kevin and Shirley decide to race the car and then set it alight, making it look like the work of joyriding vandals. While Kevin races dangerously in the car, Shirley goads him to go faster; he drives off at speed, but the <b>car</b> <b>bonnet</b> opens and Kevin crashed into wreckage, leaving him impaled by a metal pole. Shirley attempts to keep Kevin alive but fails and he dies moments before New Year 2008. Kevin's body is taken to the mortuary, where Denise kisses him at the stroke of midnight, wishing him Happy New Year. Kevin's funeral is held in January 2008, but the hearse breaks down and this results in Kevin's friends and family carrying his coffin to the crematorium. Denise reveals in June that she and Carly had scattered Kevin's ashes in the South China Sea.|$|E

40|$|In the {{computer}} aided engineering environment, exceptionally smooth but irregular surfaces are often required, such as <b>car</b> <b>bonnets.</b> It is often a lengthy process to design these surfaces {{to the degree of}} smoothness and aesthetic beauty that is required by the designer. Smoothing these surfaces is known as fairing and a variety of techniques exist to tackle the problem in different ways. A new method of surface fairing is proposed and demonstrated in this thesis. Many conventional fairing methods use an agreeable curvature plot across the surface as proof of fairness, the method documented here takes the more holistic approach of constructing the improved surface from an agreeable curvature plot.

40|$|Abstract. Designing {{the front}} grill with {{the focus on}} {{analyzing}} the flow from outside {{to the inside of}} a passenger <b>car</b> <b>bonnet</b> is very important in the automotive industry. This study was done to increase performance of the flow through the analysis on the effect of aerodynamic flow through the front grill by designing different cases of frontal areas of the front grill. Velocity at 34 m/s at steady condition were done to obtain the flow structure around a passenger car as well as the front grill of a passenger car. Analysis was taken inside the wind tunnel as the boundary condition. The grid generation was based on the tetrahedral unstructured meshes. Result obtain was compared with past experiment data. It was found that an appropriate design of frontal area of front grill can improved the stability of a car and the heat surrounding inside the <b>car</b> <b>bonnet.</b> Finally, the aerodynamics of the most suitable design of front grill was introduced and analyzed...|$|E

A comparatively thorough redesign of the Focus debuted at the 2003 Rally New Zealand, where Märtin in particular proved immediately competitive, leading only to later be forced into retirement with engine problems. The team's new leader did score his first of five career rally victories on that year's Acropolis Rally, however, (notwithstanding a dramatic mid-stage moment for he and navigator Michael Park, when the <b>car's</b> <b>bonnet</b> unexpectedly flew up), as well as becoming only the third non-Scandinavian victor of the Rally Finland, formerly the 1,000 Lakes Rally.|$|R
