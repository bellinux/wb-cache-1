50|$|East Germany was {{a socialist}} republic, {{but there was}} not <b>complete</b> {{economic}} equality. <b>Privileges</b> such as prestigious apartments and good schooling were given {{to members of the}} ruling party and their family. Eventually, Christian churches were allowed to operate without restraint after years of harassment by authorities. In the 1970s wages of East Berliners rose and working hours fell.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{player has}} {{an equal number}} of {{counters}} placed in front of them - usually from 2 to 4 - to mark his or her [...] "lives". (Alternatively, a dollar bill or other note may be used, and players use the corners to mark their lives, folding a corner in when a life is lost.) Cards are dealt, one card to each, face down. Starting {{to the left of the}} dealer - each in turn examines their card. If they are satisfied with their card they may keep it, usually simply by announcing, [...] "I'm good." [...] or similar. However, if they are unsatisfied they may pass it to the player on their left while announcing that they are [...] "not good", receiving that player's card back in return. The player to the left is obliged to exchange for the unwanted card unless they currently hold a King at which time they can refuse the card by showing their King. That transaction <b>completed,</b> <b>privilege</b> now passes to the player to the left who may or may not have a new card to decide on. (Players who have shown a King in defense are considered to have completed their play.) Play continues to the left as such. Once we reach the dealer the dealer has the same decision as any other player except that they exchange with the top card on the remaining deck instead of another player.|$|R
40|$|Successful {{privatization}} must {{be accompanied}} by the <b>complete</b> removal of <b>privileges</b> and any public policy mission. Bank behavior changes rapidly as profit maximation replaces the bureaucratic objective function. Once privileges are granted, they are difficult to remove. Therefore, privatization is a one-time (nonreversible) operation. The German mortgage bank, DePfa, went through a carefully planned and lengthy privatization process that was successful. Fannie Mae, the U. S. mortgage firm, became a privately owned institution endowed with special privileges, which led to a quasi-monopoly position. This resulted in suboptimal financial sector performance. Fannie Mae’s special privileges have proven resistant to reform efforts. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{participatory}} action research (PAR) project was to investigate and deconstruct white racial privilege as one step toward developing an anti-racist professional identity for white students in a student affairs graduate preparation program at a predominantly white university.;This qualitative study used the approach of PAR, influenced by a critical, emancipatory perspective. Five participants came together for a 30 -hour group process that was both dialogical and experiential. Each group member was interviewed {{before and after the}} group process, and the transcripts of the interviews and group process formed the core of the data that was generated. Participants also wrote personal reflections in between the PAR group sessions and these reflective writings were analyzed as part of the data. Finally, as an evaluation component and as a method to triangulate data, each participant <b>completed</b> the White <b>Privilege</b> Attitude Scale (WPAS) (Pinterits, 2004) {{at the beginning and end}} of the PAR group process.;Several significant moments or categories emerged from an analysis of the PAR group process transcripts. The all-white constitution of the group and the engaged and democratic framework of PAR facilitated the formation of a cohesive dialogue marked by authenticity and trust among the members. The group participated in a series of experiential activities that helped them apprehend the construct of white privilege and begin to problematize its presence in their lives. The group worked through typical responses to white privilege awareness, such as guilt, stuckness, and resistance, and emerged with several critical, action-oriented strategies to contest privilege within their own spheres. They identified barriers to their own willingness to confront privilege and generated personal action plans to deconstruct white privilege.;The core finding of this research project was that all-white anti-racism encounter groups, especially when they are embedded within an engaged, decolonizing methodology such as PAR, can facilitate white privilege awareness among graduate students in a student affairs preparation program. This research study has implications for those who engage in social movements around issues of race, racism, and racial privilege...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} in Johnson v. Lake Drunmond Canal and Water Company (I 919. Va.) 99 S. E. 771, seems both unjust and unnecessary. It appears that in 1787 the Virginia legislature incorporated a canal company {{to erect a}} canal which should 2 ̆ 2 forever after 2 ̆ 2 be a public highway, free for transportation of goods and for travel on payment of the tolls imposed by the act of incorporation. In 1839 another act was passed authorizing the same company to construct an outlet from its canal to the Elizabeth river and granting it the power of eminent domain, provided, however, that the proprietors of abutting land should have free passage through the outlet. Prior {{to the construction of}} the outlet these lands either bordered on or were intersected by navigable creeks or streams reaching deep water and thus giving deep water access. The building of the outlet or canal completely destroyed these creeks or streams and the proviso of the Act of 1839 was inserted in order to give abutting proprietors deep water access through the canal in place of the access which was being destroyed. Soon thereafter the outlet was <b>completed</b> and the <b>privilege</b> of passage has been used by abutting proprietors, deep water access adding greatly to the value of the lands. In 1851 a railroad was given permission by the legislature to erect drawbridges across the outlet, but so as not to hinder, obstruct or delay passage of any craft on the canal; and if any such inconvenience resulted from the construction of the road, it was to be declared a nuisance and abated by the circuit court. In 1916 the latter portion of this Act was repealed and defendant canal company, who had succeeded the original canal company, was authorized by the legislature to abandon maintenance and operation of this portion of the canal or of so much of it as it deemed desirable. The defendant canal company has now sold to the defendant railroad the privilege of crossing the outlet by a permanent fill, bridge or obstruction and the railroad proposes to cross the outlet in this manner, so as completely to shut off all passage through it at the point of crossing. The plaintiffs, abutting landowners, bring this bill for an injunction which the court dismisses on the defendants 2 ̆ 7 demurrer...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} use of a loadtime metaobject {{protocol}} as a practical mechanism for enforcing access control policies upon applications distributed as user-level compiled code. Enforcing access control policies upon user-level compiled code is necessary because there are many situations where users are vulnerable to security breaches because they download and run potentially untrustworthy applications provided in the form of user-level compiled code. These applications might be distributed applications so access control for both local and distributed resources is required. Examples of potentially untrustworthy applications are Browser plug-ins, software patches, new applications, or Internet computing applications such as SETI@home. Even applications from trusted sources might be malicious or simply contain bugs that can be exploited by attackers so access control policies must be imposed to prevent the misuse of resources. Additionally, system administrators might wish to enforce access control policies upon these applications to ensure that users use them in accordance with local security requirements. Unfortunately, applications developed externally may not include the necessary enforcement code to allow the specification of organisation-specific access control policies. Operating system security mechanisms are too coarse-grained to enforce security policies on applications implemented as user-level code. Mechanisms that control access to both user-level and operating system-level resources are required for access control policies but operating system mechanisms only focus on controlling access to system-level objects. Conventional object-oriented software engineering can be used to use existing security architectures to enforce access control on user-level resources as well as system-resources. Common techniques are to insert enforcement within libraries or applications, use inheritance and proxies. However, these all provide a poor separation of concerns and cannot be used with compiled code. In-lined reference monitors provide a good separation of concerns and meet criteria for good security engineering. They use object code rewriting to control access to both userlevel and system-level objects by in-lining reference monitor code into user-level compiled code. However, their focus is upon replacing existing security architectures and current implementations do not address distributed access control policies. Another approach that does provide a good separation of concerns and allows reuse of existing security architectures are metaobject protocols. These allow constrained changes to be made to the semantics of code and therefore can be used to implement access control policies for both local and distributed resources. Loadtime metaobject protocols allow metaobject protocols to be used with compiled code because they rewrite base level classes and insert meta-level interceptions. However, these have not been demonstrated to meet requirements for good security engineering such as complete mediation. Also current implementations do not provide distributed access control. This thesis implements a loadtime metaobject protocol for the Java programming language. The design of the metaobject protocol specifically addresses separation of concerns, least <b>privilege,</b> <b>complete</b> mediation and economy of mechanism. The implementation of the metaobject protocol, called Kava, has been evaluated by implementing diverse security policies in two case studies involving third-party standalone and distributed applications. These case studies are used as the basis of inferences about general suitability of using loadtime reflection for enforcing access control policies upon user-level compiled code.
