40|$|Abstract Background Patients {{with type}} 2 {{diabetes}} {{are likely to have}} comorbid conditions which represent a high burden for patients and a challenge for primary care physicians. The aim of this cross-sectional survey was {{to assess the impact of}} additional comorbidities on quality of life within a large sample of patients with {{type 2 diabetes}} in primary care. Methods A cross-sectional survey within a large sample (3. 546) of patients with type 2 diabetes in primary care was conducted. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed by means of the Medical Outcome Study Short Form (SF- 36), self reported presence of comorbid conditions was assessed and groups with single <b>comorbidities</b> <b>were</b> selected. QoL subscales of these groups were compared to diabetes patients with no <b>comorbidities.</b> Group comparisons <b>were</b> <b>made</b> by ANCOVA adjusting for sociodemographic covariates and the presence of depressive disorder. Results Of 3546 questionnaires, 1532 were returned, thereof 1399 could be analysed. The mean number of comorbid conditions was 2. 1. 235 patients declared to have only hypertension as comorbid condition, 97 patients declared to have osteoarthritis only. Patients suffering from diabetes and hypertension reached similar scores like diabetic patients with no comorbidities. Patients with diabetes and osteoarthritis reached remarkable lower scores in all subscales. Compared to patients with diabetes alone these differences were statistically significant in the subscales representing pain and physical impairment. Conclusion The impact of osteoarthritis as an often disabling and painful condition on QoL in patients with type 2 diabetes is higher than the impact of hypertension as common but often asymptomatic comorbidity. Individual care of patients with chronic conditions should aim at both improving QoL and controlling risk factors for severe complications. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background. <b>Comorbidities</b> <b>are</b> {{conditions}} that occur simultaneously but independently of another disorder. Among skin cancer patients, <b>comorbidities</b> <b>are</b> common and may influence management. Objective. We compared comorbidity assessment by traditional medical interview (MI) and by standardized patient-reported questionnaire {{based on the}} Adult Comorbidity Evaluation- 27 (ACE- 27). Methods. Between September 2011 and October 2013, skin cancer patients underwent prospective comorbidity assessment by a Mohs surgeon (MI) and a radiation oncologist (using a standardized patient-reported questionnaire based on the ACE- 27, the PRACE- 27). <b>Comorbidities</b> <b>were</b> identified and graded according to the ACE- 27 and compared for agreement. Results. Forty-four patients were evaluated. MI and PRACE- 27 identified comorbidities in 79. 5 % and 88. 6 % (p= 0. 12) of patients, respectively. Among 27 comorbid ailments, the MI identified 9. 9 % as being present, while the PRACE- 27 identified 12. 5 %. When there were discordant observations, PRACE- 27 was more likely than MI to identify the comorbidity (OR= 5. 4, 95 % CI = 2. 4 – 14. 4, p< 0. 001).

For many of them, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, and upper gastrointestinal disease, arthritis and its treatment may also represent a risk factor. This study is concerned with an evaluation of the frequency of comorbidities in a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: The discharge diagnoses of patients with RA during the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2000 were retrieved from the database of the Department of Internal Medicine of the University of Genova, Italy. The diagnosis of RA <b>was</b> <b>made</b> if the patient’s discharge record contained the code 714 of the International Classification of Diseases, IX revision, as first 3 numbers. The other diagnoses were also recorded along with demographic data, type and duration of hospital stay, and performed procedures. Results: During the study period, 427 patients with RA were admitted to the hospital for a total number of 761 admissions, which represented 2. 2 % of total admissions. Ninety-one (21. 3 %) patients did not have comorbidities, whereas 336 (78. 6 %) had one or more comorbidities. The most frequently observed <b>comorbidities</b> <b>were</b> cardiovascular diseases (34. 6 %), including hypertension (14. 5 %) and angina (3. 5 %), followed by gastrointestinal (24. 5 %), genito-urinary (18. 7 %) and respiratory (17 %) diseases. There was a male predominance (p= 0. 004) within patients with <b>comorbidities,</b> who <b>were</b> significantly older (64. 2 ± 3. 2 years vs. 57. 2 ± 4. 2 years; p< 0. 001) and required longer periods of hospital stay (22. 7 days vs. 12. 5 days; p< 0. 001). Conclusions: <b>Comorbidities</b> <b>are</b> present in nearly 80 % of RA inpatients. <b>Comorbidity</b> <b>is</b> a good predictor of health outcome, health services utilization, and medical costs.

40|$|The {{object of}} this article was to {{systematically}} review available methods to measure comorbidity and to assess their validity and reliability. A search <b>was</b> <b>made</b> in Medline and Embase, with the keywords comorbidity and multi-morbidity, to identify articles in which a method to measure <b>comorbidity</b> <b>was</b> described. The references of these articles were also checked, and using a standardized checklist the relevant data were extracted from these articles. An assessment <b>was</b> <b>made</b> of the content, concurrent, predictive and construct validity, and the reliability. Thirteen different methods to measure <b>comorbidity</b> <b>were</b> identified: one disease count and 12 indexes. Data on content and predictive validity were available for all measures, while data on construct validity were available for nine methods, data on concurrent validity, and interrater reliability for eight methods, and data on intrarater reliability for three methods. The Charlson Index is the most extensively studied comorbidity index for predicting mortality. The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) addresses all relevant body systems without using specific diagnoses. The Index of Coexisting Disease (ICED) has a two-dimensional structure, measuring disease severity and disability, which can be useful when mortality and disability are the outcomes of interest. The Kaplan Index was specifically developed for use in diabetes research. The Charlson Index, the CIRS, the ICED and the Kaplan Index are valid and reliable methods to measure <b>comorbidity</b> that can <b>be</b> used in clinical research.

METHOD: Data were derived from the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD), a cross-sectional psychiatric epidemiological study in a representative sample of adults aged 18 years or older in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. The diagnostic instrument used was the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI). Data are based on 21 425 completed interviews. RESULTS: In general, high associations were found within the separate anxiety disorders and between mood and anxiety disorders. Lowest <b>comorbidity</b> associations <b>were</b> found for specific phobia and alcohol abuse-the disorders with the least functional disabilities. <b>Comorbidity</b> patterns <b>were</b> consistent cross-nationally. Associated factors for comorbidity of mood and anxiety disorders were female gender, younger age, lower educational level, higher degree of urbanicity, not living with a partner and unemployment. Only younger people were at greater risk for comorbidity of alcohol disorder with mood, anxiety disorders or both.

OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of GERD comorbidities in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: We prospectively studied 670 consecutive adult patients from the outpatient department of our facility. A diagnosis was established using clinical, endoscopic and/or pHmetry-related findings. Each patient's medical file was reviewed {{with respect to the}} presence of other medical conditions and diagnoses. RESULTS: Of the 670 patients, 459 (68. 6 %) were female, and the mean age was 55. 94 (17 - 80 years). We registered 316 patients (47. 1 %) with the erosive form of GERD and 354 patients (52. 9 %) with the non-erosive form. A total of 1, 664 instances of <b>comorbidities</b> <b>were</b> recorded in 586 patients (87. 5 %), with the most common being arterial hypertension (21 %), hypercholesterolemia (9 %), obesity (9 %), type II diabetes mellitus (5 %) and depression (4 %). Two or more <b>comorbidities</b> <b>were</b> present in 437 individuals (64. 8 %). The occurrence of comorbidities increased with age and was higher in patients with the non-erosive form of GERD. CONCLUSIONS: In a tertiary referral population, <b>comorbidities</b> <b>were</b> very common, and these may have worsened the already impaired health-related quality of life of these patients.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Psychiatric {{disorders}} {{are known to}} occur frequently in chronic epilepsy. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity and its relationship to regional cerebral dysfunction in patients admitted to a tertiary epilepsy center for epilepsy surgery. METHODS: 217 patients were investigated. A presurgical workup was performed and allowed precise localization of the epileptogenic focus in 156 patients. Sixty-one patients had multifocal or generalized discharges. After 1 - 3 psychiatric interviews, a psychiatric diagnosis <b>was</b> <b>made</b> (DSM-IV classification). RESULTS: Psychiatric <b>comorbidity</b> <b>was</b> found in 85 patients (39 %), more often in those with right or bilateral hemispheric dysfunction (74 %, p = 0. 04) with no difference between temporal or extratemporal foci location frequency. Additionally, patients with psychiatric disorders were less likely to undergo epilepsy surgery compared to 'epilepsy-only' patients (p = 0. 003), despite similar good outcome in patients with and without psychiatric comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Right-sided or bilateral foci seem to represent a risk factor for psychiatric comorbidity in epilepsy, although we did not find any particular association between a psychiatric syndrome and focus localization.

40|$|ABSTRACTPurpose:To {{assess whether}} retinal and {{central nervous system}} (CNS) <b>comorbidities</b> <b>are</b> risk factors for {{complications}} following robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). Materials and Methods:A retrospective review of our RALP database identified 1868 patients who underwent RALP by a single surgeon between December 10, 2003 -March 14, 2014. We hypothesized that patients with preexisting retinal or CNS <b>comorbidities</b> <b>were</b> at {{a greater risk of}} suffering retinal and CNS complications following RALP. Perioperative complications and risk of recurrence were graded using the Clavien and D'Amico systems, respectively. Results: 40 (2. 1 %) patients had retinal or CNS-related comorbidities, of which 15 had a history of retinal surgery and 24 had a history of cerebrovascular accident, aneurysm and/or neurosurgery. One additional patient had a history of both retinal and CNS events. Patients with retinal or CNS <b>comorbidities</b> <b>were</b> significantly older, had elevated PSA levels and CCI (Charlson Comorbidity Index) scores than the control group. Blood loss, length of stay, surgical duration, BMI, diagnostic Gleason score and T-stage were not statistically different between groups. No retinal or CNS complications occurred in either group. The distribution of patients between D'Amico risk categories was not statistically different between the groups. There was also no difference in the incidence of total complications between the groups. Conclusions:RALP-associated retinal and CNS complications are rare.

With a new co-occurrence analysis the relative risks for each possible <b>comorbidity</b> <b>are</b> studied as a function of patient age and gender, a temporal analysis investigates whether the onset of diabetes typically precedes or follows the onset of the other disease. The samples is always of maximal size, i. e. contains all patients with that comorbidity within the country. The present study is an equivalent of almost 40, 000 studies, all with maximum patient number available. Out of more than thousand possible associations, 123 comorbid diseases for type 1 or type 2 diabetes are identified at high significance levels. Well known diabetic <b>comorbidities</b> <b>are</b> recovered, such as retinopathies, hypertension, chronic kidney diseases, etc. This validates the method. Additionally, a number of <b>comorbidities</b> <b>are</b> identified which have only been recognized to a lesser extent, for example epilepsy, sepsis, or mental disorders. The temporal evolution, age, and gender-dependence of these <b>comorbidities</b> <b>are</b> discussed. The new statistical-network methodology developed here can be readily applied to other chronic diseases. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{epidemiological}} {{and clinical}} studies found a {{high incidence of}} comorbidity in children and adolescent psychiatry. In population of children and adolescents is most often described and researched comorbidity of depression, anxiety disorders, than in hyperkinetic and behavioral disorders, and finally the difficulty in reading (dyslexia) and antisocial behavior disorders. The common occurrence of two diagnoses {{may be the result of}} an disorder that has a complex pattern of symptoms, which apparently seems to be two disorders, but in fact is a single disorder. <b>Comorbidity</b> may <b>be</b> two disorders that share the same set of risk factors or is it possible that a one disorder is a risk of development of other disorder. Knowledge and understanding of <b>comorbidity</b> <b>is</b> important as a preventive and therapeutic point of view. <b>Comorbidity</b> <b>is</b> particularly important because complicates diagnostic process and influences the course, prognosis and treatment of children and adolescents...|$|R
