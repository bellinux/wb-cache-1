5|$|In July 1676 Carbery {{called for}} a hearing against Morgan {{in front of the}} Assembly of Jamaica, accusing him of collaborating with the French to attack Spanish interests. Morgan {{admitted}} he had met the French officials, but indicated that that this was diplomatic relations, rather than anything duplicitous. In the summer of 1677 the Lords of Trade said they had yet to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> on the matter and in early 1678 the king and the Privy Council recalled Carbery from Jamaica, leaving Morgan as governor for three months. In July 1678 Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Carlisle was appointed governor.|$|E
5|$|Most records {{received}} by the committee are processed within a year and published in its annual report in British Birds. Some records prove problematic, and for some species, it has taken the committee many years to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision.</b> This has particularly been the case where the species or subspecies in question was new to Britain—examples include northern harrier (Britain's first, in Scilly in 1982, accepted in 2007), long-toed stint (Britain's first, in Cornwall in 1970, accepted in 1994), least tern (Britain's first, and to date only record, accepted in 2005, after first occurring in 1983), black lark (Britain's first, from Spurn, Yorkshire in 1984, accepted in 2004 after {{a second set of}} notes came to light), Sykes's warbler (the first three records, from 1959, 1977, and 1993, accepted in 2003), Iberian chiffchaff (the first two records, from 1972 and 1992, accepted in 2000), and Hume's leaf warbler (the first 27 records, the earliest from 1966, accepted in 1998). Occasionally, decisions have been delayed due to non-ornithological factors, perhaps most notably with the loss by the Royal Mail of a file on Britain's first lesser short-toed lark.|$|E

5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E
25|$|Once a case came to court, {{the method}} used to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> was usually by compurgation. Under this system the person accused or the parties to a dispute would give their version under oath, {{following}} which they {{had to find a}} number of others who would take an oath that the principal's oath could be trusted. The number of compurgators required depended {{on the nature of the}} case. The judge or judges would then <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision.</b> Capital punishment was only prescribed for a small number of crimes. Homicide was usually dealt with by the payment of compensation to the victim's family, while theft could be punished by death only if it was theft by stealth and the thief was caught with the goods in hand; the value of the goods stolen also had to exceed four pence. Most other offences were punished by a fine.|$|E

25|$|In Lines International, the High Court {{held that}} since the Port of Singapore Authority was the {{authority}} vested with control over berths for vessels, it could not abdicate its responsibility by taking orders from other statutory boards unless it was under a legal duty to do so. If, on the evidence, a court concludes that an authority has fettered its discretion by acting under dictation from other people or bodies, its decision will be invalid. The authority has to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> based on its own discretion, taking into account other relevant facts or evidence.|$|E
25|$|Porter met up {{with the}} van after Goodson called dispatchers to ask for an officer to come check on Gray. He was {{requested}} twice by Gray for a medic, but did not call for one. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter; second degree assault; misconduct in office. Porter posted a 350,000 bail. The grand jury indicted Porter on all charges and added an indictment of reckless endangerment. On December 16, 2015, a mistrial was declared on all charges, after the jury was hung and could not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision.</b> Porter's second trial was scheduled for June 13, 2016. Analysts stated that the Porter's retrial could have caused problems for the other trials, under the presumption {{that he could not}} be compelled to testify while there are pending charges against him. After several appeals and reversals, the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that Porter would be required to testify in the cases against the other officers. Officer Porter's retrial date was originally scheduled for September 6, 2016. On July 27, 2016, all charges against him were dropped.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Barclays Bank {{proposed}} a redevelopment of 55-73 Colmore Row. The scheme involved {{the demolition of}} the entire building except for the façades and the banking hall of the listed building. The local planning authority called for greater retention of the building structure as with other schemes in the area. The agents submitted multiple planning applications {{to put pressure on}} the planning department. As the planning department failed to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> on two planning applications in their time periods, the bank took the case to a government department. Barclays and local planning authority failed to reach any deal in negotiations, which eventually broke down. The government saw that the retention of the façade was satisfactory as it allowed the economic reuse of the site. The decision left the development and design framework for the area in a weakened state as the building subject to the decision was deemed to be of less national importance in respect to its local importance. The use of façadism on the building has since been seen as successful following the addition of Mansard roofs providing additional floorspace.|$|E

Of the drivers' opinions, Stoddart writes: [...] "While I cannot testify that each and every driver agreed with what we were proposing, what I can say with certainty is that no driver disagreed." [...] The Ferrari drivers expressed no opinion in the matter, leaving the decision to Todt, who was not present. The nine team principals who were present then resolved that, unless they and the FIA could <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> {{in the best interest}} of the sport, they would not participate in the race.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision,</b> Lois and Peter decide to visit the local {{family-planning}} center, and ultimately decide to abort the embryo. However, as Peter exits the center he encounters an anti-abortion rally, where he is shown an anti-abortion video {{by one of the}} protesters. The video causes him to reconsider about aborting the unborn baby. Returning home, Lois continues to advocate her right to choose, while Peter now attempts to argue the unborn child's right to life and whether Lois has the responsibility of carrying it to term. At their wits' end, the two decide to discuss the matter, once and for all. The next day, Lois talks with the family about [...] "the wonderful new member of the Griffin family", but then, after a few seconds of silence, Peter turns to the camera and says to the audience [...] "We had the abortion", promptly ending the episode.|$|E
500|$|In November 1960, John F. Kennedy {{was elected}} {{president}} after a campaign that promised American superiority over the Soviet Union {{in the fields of}} space exploration and missile defense. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the [...] "missile gap" [...] that he and many other senators felt had formed between the Soviets and themselves due to the inaction of President Eisenhower. Beyond military power, Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US not [...] "first but, first and, first if, but first period." [...] Despite Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> on the status of the Apollo program once he became president. He knew little about the technical details of the space program, and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing. When Kennedy's newly appointed NASA Administrator James E. Webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} of compatibility between Orthodoxy and imiaslavie is still hotly argued by some theologians.

The trial was later moved to Seattle, Washington due to media publicity. Loukaitis had pleaded insanity on all charges against him, and claimed that [...] "mood swings" [...] were the cause of his violent actions. During his trial, Joan Petrich testified that Loukaitis had been experiencing delusional and messianic thoughts before the shooting.

He felt he was superior to other people, and then those feelings were later replaced by hate, disdain, and not measuring up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bishop Brown {{soon became}} acquainted with Brother Schuckardt {{and tried to}} persuade him to accept {{ordination}} from him. Later he proposed to consecrate Brother Schuckardt to the episcopacy in addition to ordaining him to the priesthood. After Bishop Brown had repented of having received consecration from the Old Catholics, Brother Schuckardt agreed to receive consecration from Bishop Brown: [...] "hese past months have been spent in intense soul searching and continuous prayer to know and follow God's holy will. Thus I could not give you a reply until I felt fairly certain in my heart and mind. Now, finally, in concluding our novena in honor of the Annunciation, I have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision.</b> It is with holy trepidation that I accept your offer..." [...] Between October 28 and November 1, 1971, Schuckardt was ordained and consecrated a bishop in a rented ballroom in Chicago, as they were not welcome in the churches of the Catholic Church.|$|E

[...] Judge Adrine also found probable cause to charge Officer Frank Garmback with negligent homicide and dereliction of duty. [...] Because Ohio judges lack the legal authority to issue arrest warrants in such cases, his opinion was forwarded to city prosecutors and Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty who, as of that date, had not yet <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> on whether to present the evidence to a grand jury.|$|E
