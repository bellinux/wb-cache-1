5|$|The fort was rediscovered {{by historians}} and {{excavated}} in 1996, {{and the area}} is now an archaeological site. In 1995, researchers located the ship La Belle in Matagorda Bay, with several sections of the hull remaining virtually intact. They constructed a <b>cofferdam,</b> {{the first to be}} used in North America to excavate the ship as if in dry conditions. In 2000, excavations revealed three of the original structures of the fort, as well as three graves of Frenchmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} from the ice caused Endurance to start to take on water. To prevent the ship from flooding McNish built a <b>cofferdam,</b> caulking it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over the seams, standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked. He could not prevent the {{pressure from}} the ice crushing the ship though and was experienced enough {{to know when to}} stop trying. Once the ship had been destroyed he was put in charge of rescuing the stores from what had been The Ritz. With McNish in charge it took only a couple of hours to open the deck far enough to retrieve a good quantity of provisions.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{embankment}} began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the <b>cofferdam</b> {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one and a half feet (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed. On May 28, 1970, {{the embankment}} was finally topped out with the last of over 250,000 truckloads of material.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the 3 -D CFD {{simulation}} of the free-surface flow approaching the intakes of Caruachi Powerhouse is presented. The {{aim of the}} investigation is {{to determine whether or}} not vortex structures are likely to appear from the water surface through the intakes, as the result of the presence of <b>cofferdams</b> placed few meters upstream of the intakes. The presence of <b>cofferdams</b> was a note of concern with regard to the effects they might have on the turbine intakes once the hydroelectric central starts operating. In all the considered conditions, results did not show neither strong surface vortices in the proximities of the Power House intakes, nor air entrainment-entrapment towards the intakes, which reflects the safe operation of the turbines in the presence of the <b>cofferdams.</b> The latter added in decision taking on leaving the <b>cofferdams</b> submerged instead of removing them, which resulted in cost savings for the projec...|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the St. Lawrence Seaway, a system of canals and locks {{that would make the}} St. Lawrence River suitable for shipping. As part of the seaway's construction, a low-lying area in Ontario and New York between Waddington, New York, and Cornwall, Ontario, would be inundated with water {{in order to create a}} navigable channel through the Long Sault rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall. Much of NY37B was located within the flood-prone region due to its proximity to the river. On July1, 1958, the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction of a <b>cofferdam</b> upstream, creating what is now known as Lake St. Lawrence and inundating the majority of NY37B west of Massena.|$|E
5|$|The dam {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the 1950s; construction work commenced in 1968, involving the diversion of the North Fork American River through a tunnel {{and the construction of}} a massive earthen <b>cofferdam.</b> Following a nearby earthquake and the discovery of a seismic fault that underlay the dam site, work on the project was halted for fears that the dam's design would not allow it to survive a major quake on the same fault zone. Although the dam was redesigned and a new proposal submitted by 1980, spiraling costs and limited economic justification {{put an end to the}} project until severe flooding in 1986 briefly renewed interest in Auburn's flood control potential. The California State Water Resources Control Board denied water rights for the dam project in 2008 due to lack of construction progress.|$|E
5|$|Yavuz escorted {{the members}} of the Ottoman Armistice Commission to Odessa on 30 March 1918, after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed. After {{returning}} to Constantinople she sailed in May to Sevastopol where she had her hull cleaned and some leaks repaired. Yavuz and several destroyers sailed for Novorossiysk on 28 June to intern the remaining Soviet warships, but they had already been scuttled when the Turkish ships arrived. The destroyers remained, but Yavuz returned to Sevastopol. On 14 July the ship was laid up {{for the rest of the}} war. While in Sevastopol, dockyard workers scraped fouling from the ship's bottom. Yavuz subsequently returned to Constantinople, where from 7 August to 19 October a concrete <b>cofferdam</b> was installed to repair one of the three areas damaged by mines.|$|E

50|$|The three {{towers of}} the {{cantilever}} are each seated on four circular piers. Since the foundations were required to be constructed at or below sea level, they were excavated {{with the assistance of}} caissons and <b>cofferdams.</b> Caissons were used at locations that were either always under water, even at low tide, or where the foundations were to be built on mud and clay. <b>Cofferdams</b> were used where rock was nearer to the surface, and it was possible to work in low tide.|$|R
25|$|On November 2, 1999, Montana Power {{announced}} it was selling all of its dams and other electric power generating plants to PPL, Inc. for $1.6 billion. The sale was expected to generate $30 million in taxes {{for the state of}} Montana (although MPC said the total would be lower). Subsequently, in May 2000 PPL {{announced it}} would use small steel <b>cofferdams</b> to drain the water around the flashboards and allow their repair without lowering the level of the lake. The cost of using the <b>cofferdams</b> was $300,000. Twenty-one of the dam's 31 flashboards were replaced.|$|R
5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a <b>cofferdam</b> around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E

It was his first major road bridge, and he gave exacting instructions for its construction, advising the trustees to build deep foundations by day labour instead of contract. The piers were sunk into the bedrock to a depth of 7 ft using <b>cofferdams,</b> this level being around 15 ft below low water. The <b>cofferdams</b> were kept dry by a pump driven by a water wheel on the south bank of the river.|$|R

25|$|The Corps {{immediately}} alerted Congress in May 1910 {{that the}} job could not be done for the $100,000 appropriated. On June 17, Congress appropriated $200,000 more, and authorized the Corps to sign contracts for whatever services it needed (without regard to cost). In August, the Special Engineering Board decided not to bring the Maine back to the United States but to sink her at sea. The wreck would be surveyed before any work began. Caissons would then be constructed around the wreck to form a <b>cofferdam,</b> the water pumped out, and any bodies removed.|$|E
25|$|With {{the tunnel}} cleared, it was resurfaced and {{modified}} {{to accommodate the}} force of a river instead of a railroad. Until this time, the Sacramento had still been flowing through the middle of the dam site, between the two nearly completed abutments of the dam. An earth/rock filled <b>cofferdam</b> was constructed across the river, which now began to flow through the tunnel, drying out the dam site and enabling work to begin on the middle section of the dam, which contained the spillway bays. The spillways with their 18 high-pressure river outlet valves and massive triple drum gates were completed in the summer of 1943. By then, a total of 15 million tons of concrete had been used in the dam's construction, comprising the 16,900 50-foot blocks.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{of the new}} bridge {{began in}} November 1887. Complications arose when the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B), whose tracks ran along the north/eastern shore of the Anacostia River, sued the federal government, arguing that the bridge {{abutment}} encroached on its right-of-way; eventually the railroad agreed to move its tracks closer to the riverbank, {{and the federal government}} paid for the move. But yet more construction delays occurred. Due to the heavily silted bottom of the river, the Army Corps of Engineers could not find solid ground on which to build the bridge's piers and abutments, requiring construction of a <b>cofferdam</b> and extensive excavation and investigation of the riverbed. A major flood in 1888 damaged some of the work, and caused further delays.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in December 1910, a <b>cofferdam</b> {{was built}} around the wreck and water was pumped out, exposing the wreck by late 1911. Between 20 November and 2 December 1911, a court of inquiry headed by Rear Admiral Charles E. Vreeland {{inspected}} the wreck. They concluded that an external explosion had triggered {{the explosion of the}} magazines. However, this explosion was farther aft and lower powered than concluded by the Sampson Board. The Vreeland Board also found that the bending of frame 18 was caused by the explosion of the magazines, not by the external explosion. After the investigation, the newly located dead were buried in Arlington National Cemetery and the hollow, intact portion of the hull of Maine was refloated and ceremoniously scuttled at sea on 16 March 1912.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 1958, Dr. Otto Holden, chief {{engineer}} of Hydroelectric Power Commusssion, and J. Burch McMorron, Chief Engineer of The New York Power Authority, detonated 27 metric tonnes of explosives to demolish the <b>cofferdam</b> that had diverted St. Lawrence River water {{away from the}} powerhouse construction site. It took four days for the plant to become fully operational. The last generators were commissioned in 1959. Previously, in 1956, the IJC established the International St. Lawrence River Board of Control as a mechanism to regulate the river {{above and below the}} dam. Competing interests for power and navigation had to be controlled in order to maintain good function of the dam. Those interested in power and flood control desired moderate water levels and the shipping industry and power station operators wanted levels to be higher.|$|E
25|$|Excavation {{and primary}} {{concrete}} for the dam, powerhouse and spillway was mainly completed by June 2009. The spillway gate hoist housing had been erected {{and the river}} closure and diversion occurred in July 2009. Construction required an access road and construction camp site, and a construction power substation, along with services such as water supply and sewage lagoons for the camp. A new 230 kV gas-insulated substation was constructed adjacent to the dam site, which will distribute power from the Wuskwatim generators to the transmission network. A <b>cofferdam</b> was constructed for excavation of the tailrace and spillway channel, and subsequently removed.
