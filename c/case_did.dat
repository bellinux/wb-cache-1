5|$|In 2006 the Hungarian {{newspaper}} Life and Literature {{revealed that}} Szabó {{had been an}} informant of the Communist regime's secret police. Between 1957 and 1961, he submitted forty-eight reports on seventy-two people, mostly classmates and teachers at the Academy of Theatrical and Cinematic Arts. According to historian Istvan Deak, only in one <b>case</b> <b>did</b> Szabó's informing cause significant damage, when an individual was denied a passport.|$|E
5|$|The primary arrestee in the case, Phillip Greg Garrido, {{was born}} in Contra Costa County, California, on April 5, 1951. He grew up in Brentwood, where he {{graduated}} from Liberty High School in 1969. In 1972, Garrido {{was arrested and charged}} with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, but the <b>case</b> <b>did</b> not go to trial after the girl declined to testify.|$|E

5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the <b>case</b> <b>did</b> not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|On 19 October 2012, the Khamovniki District Court in Moscow {{rejected}} {{an appeal}} for deferment of sentence filed by Violetta Volkova {{on behalf of}} Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, {{on the grounds that}} the <b>case</b> <b>did</b> not fall within its jurisdiction. Tolokonnikova subsequently filed an appeal with the Zubovo-Polyansky District Court in Mordovia, where she was imprisoned, and Alyokhina with the Berezniki District Court in Perm. Alyokhina's appeal was rejected on January 16, 2013, the judge stating that the presence of her child was already taken into account during her original sentence.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the <b>case</b> <b>did</b> not damage Laforey's career: his junior {{officers}} were promoted after the action and he was given command of the larger frigate HMS Aimable. He went on to serve at the Battle of Trafalgar and become a full admiral {{before his death in}} 1835. However, historian Tom Wareham has speculated that the legal case was probably the reason that Laforey was denied the knighthood that customarily accompanied a successful frigate action {{at this stage of the}} war. More than five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants from Carysfort still living in 1847.|$|E

5|$|In Lee Hsien Loong the appellants, {{which were}} in Hong Kong, {{challenged}} {{the jurisdiction of the}} High Court to hear a defamation suit brought by the respondents on the ground, among others, that the service of the writ should have been effected in accordance with the civil procedure convention set down in the Treaty of Judicial Assistance in Civil and Commercial Matters between the Republic of Singapore and the People's Republic of China. Thus, although this was not a judicial review case, the Court had to consider the justiciability of determining whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong, and whether the Court could depart from the views of the executive branch on the matter which were stated in a letter issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Court held that the present <b>case</b> <b>did</b> not involve the exercise of the sovereign or legislative prerogative in matters of high policy. Rather, it was concerned with the effect, and not the making, of the treaty or whether it was advisable. Thus, the letter from the Ministry was not an exercise of executive prerogative power, but merely a statement of opinion.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the <b>case</b> <b>did</b> not quickly fade. The play Maria Marten, or The Murder in the Red Barn {{existed in}} various {{anonymous}} versions; {{it was a}} sensational hit throughout the mid 19th century {{and may have been}} the most performed play of the time. Victorian fairground peep shows were forced to add extra apertures for their viewers when exhibiting their shows of the murder. The plays of the Victorian era tended to portray Corder as a cold-blooded monster and Maria as the innocent whom he preyed upon; her reputation and her children by other fathers were airbrushed out, and Corder was made into an older man. Charles Dickens published an account of the murder in his magazine All the Year Round after initially rejecting it because he felt the story to be too well known and the account of the stepmother's dreams rather far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. Souter {{referenced}} prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama, to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland. Souter stated that the decision in this <b>case</b> <b>did</b> not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it did with the Philippines, or for the Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E

25|$|Although the Oyama <b>case</b> <b>did</b> {{not strike}} down the 1913 and 1920 California Alien Land Laws, it {{nonetheless}} {{proved to be}} an important precedent. In part relying on the Oyama decision, the California Supreme Court found the Alien Land Laws unconstitutional in Sei Fujii v. California, 38 Cal.2d 718, 242 P.2d 617 (1952), and California finally repealed them in 1956.|$|E

25|$|Trestrail has {{hypothesized}} that the police planted the body parts and particularly the fragment of the pyjama top at the scene to incriminate Crippen.

25|$|In opposition, Quon and {{the other}} {{respondents}} argued, as Wardlaw's concurrence had, that Ikuta and petitioners had greatly exaggerated {{the role that the}} less-intrusive-means test had played in the panel opinion, and that the facts of the <b>case</b> <b>did</b> not present any constitutional issues.

25|$|The Court agreed {{by a vote}} of 8 to 1 {{with the}} petitioners’ first {{contention}} – that is, that the Alien Land Law, as applied in this <b>case,</b> <b>did</b> indeed deprive Fred Oyama of the equal protection of California’s laws and of his privileges as an American citizen. Because this decision alone was grounds for reversal of the California Supreme Court decision, the Court saw no need to address the second and third contentions.|$|E
25|$|Its first <b>case</b> <b>did</b> {{not occur}} until {{early in the}} Court's third term, with West v. Barnes (1791).

Instead of grappling with {{the constitutionality of the}} law, however, the Court unanimously decided the case on procedural grounds, strictly interpreting statutory requirements.|$|E
