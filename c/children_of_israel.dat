5|$|During Memphis's 1873 {{yellow fever}} {{epidemic}}, he—along with other Memphis rabbis and leading Jews—remained {{in the city}} rather than fleeing. During the seven weeks the epidemic lasted, 51 people were buried in B'nai Israel's cemetery, almost twice the number typically buried there in a whole year. When another yellow fever epidemic broke out in 1878, Samfield stayed again, ministering to the dead and dying of all faiths. During that epidemic 78 people were buried in the congregation's cemetery. The city's frequent yellow fever epidemics decimated its Jewish community, which dropped from 2,100 to 300. They also hurt B'nai Israel's finances; members did not pay their dues, {{and for a time}} the congregation could not afford to pay Samfield. By 1880, however, membership had increased to 124 families, and finances had improved. By this time, the synagogue was more typically called <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel.</b> Beth El Emeth was affected more severely than <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> by the epidemics; its rabbi (Peres) died of yellow fever in 1879. In 1882, Beth El Emeth disbanded, and transferred its property to <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> though most Beth El Emeth members joined the Orthodox Baron Hirsch Synagogue. The property included land on Second Street, and Beth El Emeth's cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The Torah {{provides}} four details {{regarding the}} traditions surrounding Joseph’s remains. The account in Genesis relates that, before his death, {{he had his}} brothers swear they would carry his bones out of Egypt to Canaan. He is then {{said to have been}} embalmed then placed in a coffin in Egypt. In Exodus, we are told that Moses fulfilled the pledge by taking Joseph's bones with him when he left Egypt. In Joshua, Joseph’s bones are said to have been brought from Egypt by the <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> and interred in Shechem.The bones of Joseph, which the <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> brought up out of Egypt, were buried in Shechem in a parcel of land Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver (qeśîṭâ)..|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Black Christians have {{identified}} themselves spiritually with the <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel.</b> In the late 19th century, {{some of them}} also began to claim {{that they were the}} biological descendants of the Israelites. This identification with the Israelites was a response to the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including slavery and racial discrimination. For African-Americans, appropriating Jewish history was part of a rebellion against the American racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their desire to know their origins and regain their lost history.|$|E
5|$|After the United States entered World WarI in 1917, 131 {{men from}} <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> enlisted or were drafted; one was killed. By 1919, the congregation's family {{membership}} had reached 450, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $18,000 (today $). The congregational school, which still held classes once a week, had 14 teachers and 388 students. The following year, women {{were given the}} right to vote at all congregational meetings. Fineshriber left in 1924 to become head rabbi of Congregation Keneseth Israel in Philadelphia. During his tenure, Children of Israel's membership doubled, and the religious school grew from 100 to 550 students. He died in 1968, and is the congregation's only deceased senior rabbi not buried in its cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Ettelson became locally {{famous for}} a debate {{he had at}} Nashville's Ellis Auditorium with Scopes Trial lawyer Clarence Darrow {{on whether or not}} {{religion}} was necessary. Ettelson argued in favor, Darrow against. Friction between Ettelson and some board members came to a head in 1937, when the board discussed the issue of whether to retain him as rabbi; when invited to the meeting, he spoke briefly, then resigned. The board recommended that his tenure be put to a congregational vote at the next annual meeting, where he was re-elected in a secret ballot by a vote of 303 to 31. He took an eight-month medical leave in 1938, and <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> hired Morton Cohn as assistant rabbi.|$|E

5|$|Peres {{was fired}} in 1860 because he opened a store that {{conducted}} business on Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath. He was replaced by Simon Tuska, who moved the congregation from Orthodox to Reform practices. Tuska died in 1871, and was succeeded by Max Samfield; under his leadership, the synagogue {{was one of the}} founding members of the Union for Reform Judaism. In 1884, <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> completed a new building, and membership grew rapidly. Samfield died in 1915, and was succeeded by Bill Fineshriber, an outspoken supporter of women's suffrage and equal rights for African Americans. The following year the congregation moved to a new building, where membership continued to grow. Fineshriber left in 1924, and was succeeded by Harry Ettelson.|$|E

5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered to}} be neither the incarnation nor the son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim.|$|E

He studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and won the Gold Medal. While he was playing at the Piccadilly Hotel, London, he was offered the job of leader of the Scottish Symphony Orchestra, at the age of 17. In World War II, he originally served as Gunner Jaffa in the Royal Artillery, but subsequently joined the Royal Air Force and became a pilot in RAF Bomber Command.|$|R
5|$|In 1872, <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> {{purchased}} land on Adams Avenue, {{with the}} intent of building a new synagogue there, but financial pressures delayed the project, and in 1880 the congregation decided to sell the property and find a better one. They sold the lot in 1882, and instead purchased land on Poplar Avenue between Second and Third Streets. By 1884, they had completed a new synagogue building there, at a cost of $39,130 (today $). The Byzantine Revival structure had an impressive façade featuring twin tall spires and a large round window containing a Star of David. The building helped attract new members; by 1885 an additional 45 had joined, for a total of 173 member families, and the congregation was again debt-free. That year, the synagogue acquired a cemetery on Hernando Road.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{was heavily}} involved in World WarII, with many members serving in the armed forces, including Dudley Weinberg, who had succeeded Cohn as assistant rabbi. <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> published a special newsletter for overseas members; {{by the end of}} the war, approximately four hundred congregants had served—and fourteen had died—in the U.S. military. As with many other Reform congregations, the members of Temple Israel were split on the issue of Zionism. It is likely that a majority were anti-Zionist, and the synagogue president joined the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism, though other prominent members supported Zionism, and still others were simply non-Zionist. Ettelson initially opposed Zionism, though he did not join the council. With the growth of antisemitism inside and outside the United States, his views changed, and he was an early member of the local chapter of the Zionist United Palestine Appeal. Nevertheless, he successfully kept the issue from becoming divisive at the temple.|$|E

A less interested, or less selfish being than Mary Pratt, never existed. In this respect she was the very antipodes of her uncle, who often stealthily rebuked her for her charities and acts of neighbourly kindness, which he was wont to term waste. But Mary kept the even tenor of her way, seemingly not hearing such remarks, and doing her duty quietly, and in all humility.|$|R

60|$|Thus {{it will be}} seen, {{that the}} {{persecution}} of the Jewish race has deprived European society of an important conservative element, and added to the destructive party an influential ally. Prince Metternich, the most enlightened of modern statesmen, {{not to say the}} most intellectual of men, was, though himself a victim of the secret societies, fully aware of these premises. It was always his custom, great as were the difficulties which in so doing he had to encounter, to employ as much as possible the Hebrew race in the public service. He could never forget that Napoleon, in his noontide hour, had been checked by the pen of the greatest of political writers; he had found that illustrious author as great in the cabinet as in the study; he knew that no one had more contributed to the deliverance of Europe.

60|$|The guests {{may have}} {{numbered}} fifty or sixty, old and young, gentle and simple, {{of the most}} varied types and appearance. I observed {{that many of them}} cast haughty and inquiring glances round them, in the pauses between the dishes, as though each marvelled how he came {{to be a member of}} so motley a crew. Their only common feature appeared to be the devotion which they showed to the platter and the wine flagon. There was little talking, for there were few who knew their neighbours. Some were soldiers who had come to offer their swords and their services to the King's lieutenant; others were merchants from Bristol, with some proposal or suggestion anent the safety of their property. There were two or three officials of the city, who had come out to receive instructions as to its defence, while here and there I marked the <b>child</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> who had found his way there in the hope that in times of trouble he might find high interest and noble borrowers. Horse-dealers, saddlers, armourers, surgeons, and clergymen completed the company, who were waited upon by a staff of powdered and liveried servants, who brought and removed the dishes with the silence and deftness of long training.|$|R
60|$|It is {{probable}} that the young <b>child</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> {{if he had been}} attempting any mischief, did not succeed in it. Had there been any trouble, it is likely enough that he would have involved Allen in the grief. Then Allen would have been in a, perhaps, unprecedented position. He could have established an alibi, as far as the Jew's affairs went, by proving that he had been at Blocksby's at the hour when the boy would truthfully have sworn that he had let him into Isaacs' chambers. And, as far as the charge against him at Blocksby's went, the evidence of the young Jew would have gone to prove that he was at Isaacs', where he had no business to be, when we saw him at Blocksby's. But, unhappily, each alibi would have been almost equally compromising. The difficulty never arose, but the reason why Allen refused to give any account of what he had been doing, and where he had been, at four o'clock on that Saturday afternoon--a refusal that told so heavily against him--is now sufficiently clear. His statement would, we may believe, never have been corroborated by the youthful Hebrew, who certainly had his own excellent reasons for silence, and who probably had carefully established an alibi of his own elsewhere.|$|R
