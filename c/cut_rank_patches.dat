No shoulder-strap slip-ons are available for enlisted members of the army, whereas the other two services had appropriate slip ons, who have <b>rank</b> <b>patches</b> sewed onto the uniform arms.

Cadet members wear a pair of Olive Green lightweight trousers instead of DPM lightweight trousers. Combat Soldier 95 (CS95) shirts were restricted by the Corps as the system adopt rank slides instead of epaulettes. However, some members modified the shirts, putting epaulettes tapes onto the uniform to meet the standard of the Corps. Also, olive-green brassards used by Regular Army in early-80's are adopted by the Corps, instead of <b>rank</b> <b>patches</b> used in late-80's and early-90's.|$|R
50|$|Oberführer wore two oak {{leaves on}} the uniform collar <b>rank</b> <b>patch,</b> along with the {{shoulder}} boards and lapels of a general officer. In 1938, the status of SS-Oberführer began to change {{with the rise of}} the SS-Verfügungstruppe which would later become the Waffen-SS. Since Brigadeführer was rated equal to a Generalmajor, and Standartenführer to an Oberst, Oberführer had no military equivalent and quickly became regarded as a senior colonel rank. This distinction continues in historical circles with most texts referring to Oberführer as a senior colonel rank while some others state it has a military equivalent to a British Army brigadier.|$|R

50|$|New {{insignia}} {{were issued}} to GUGB in 1937 and to Militsiya in 1939. It was now based on collar <b>rank</b> <b>patches</b> of the Red Army and Internal Troops. Confusingly, the special NKVD rank system was left intact, so for example Captain of Militsiya/State Security was assigned the three-box insignia {{of an army}} Colonel (in the Red Army, this patch was reassigned to lieutenant colonel in September 1939, but the NKVD did not alter their insignia) and Major of Militsiya/State Security was mapped to one-romb insignia of Kombrig (a brigade commander) (which was abolished for commanding officers of the Red Army in May 1940). This created {{a great deal of}} inconsistency and tension between army and NKVD/NKGB officers.|$|R

40|$|As {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used nearly in every field, SAR image de-noising became a very important research field. A new SAR image de-noising method based on texture strength and weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) is proposed. To implement blind de-noising, the accurate estimation of noise variance is very important. So far, {{it is still a}} challenge to estimate SAR image noise level accurately because of the rich texture. Principal component analysis (PCA) and the low <b>rank</b> <b>patches</b> selected by image texture strength are used to estimate the noise level. With the help of noise level, WNNM can be expected to SAR image de-noising. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms many excellent de-noising algorithms such as Bayes least squares-Gaussian scale mixtures (BLS-GSM) method, non-local means (NLM) filtering in terms of both quantitative measure and visual perception quality.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that in order to study {{primitive}} recursion in higher types it is useful to unfold the primitive recursion operators into infinite terms. A similar phenomenon occurs in proof theory, where one expands induction axioms. For applications it then is often necessary to code these infinite objects by natural numbers. A standard method to design such a coding is to proceed as in Kleene's system O of ordinal notations; cf. [6] for a recursion theoretic and [7] for a proof theoretic application of this method. However, working with such codes is not easy. For instance, to prove that the standard operation reducing the <b>cut</b> <b>rank</b> by one can be represented by a primitive recursive operation on codes requires some careful applications of Kleene's recursion theorem for primitive recursive functions...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares {{securities}} settlement {{gross and}} netting architectures. It studies settlement risk arising from exogenous operational delays and compares settlement failures {{between the two}} architectures as functions {{of the length of}} the settlement interval under different market conditions. While settlement failures are non monotonically related to the length of settlement cycles under both architectures, there is no clear <b>cut</b> <b>ranking</b> of which architecture delivers greater stability. We show that while, on average, netting systems seem to be more stable than gross systems, rare events may lead to contagious defaults that could affect the all system. Furthermore netting system are very sensitive to the number and initial distribution of traded shares.

40|$|Parameterised {{configurations}} for FPGAs are configuration bitstreams {{of which}} part of the bits are defined as Boolean functions of parameters. By evaluating these Boolean functions using different parameter values, {{it is possible to}} quickly and efficiently derive specialised configuration bitstreams with different properties. An important application of parameterised configurations is the generation of specialised configuration bitstreams for Dynamic Circuit Specialisation. Generating and using parameterised configurations requires a new FPGA tool flow. In this paper we present an algorithm for technology mapping of parameterised designs that can exploit the reconfigurability of the logic blocks and routing of the FPGA. This algorithm, called TCONMAP, is based on “Cut enumeration, <b>cut</b> <b>ranking,</b> node selection”. As part of it, a new method to calculate the feasibility of cuts based on the Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD) of their local function is proposed...|$|R

For hypergraph matching on k-uniform hypergraphs, we show that using Chvátal-Gomory <b>cuts</b> of low <b>rank</b> can reduce the integrality gap significantly even though Sherali-Adams relaxation has a large gap even after linear number of rounds. On the other hand, we show that for other problems such as k-CSP, unique label cover, maximum cut, and vertex cover, the integrality gap remains large even after adding all Chvátal-Gomory <b>cuts</b> of large <b>rank.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{appearance}} {{model has}} been shown to be essential for robust visual tracking since it is the basic criterion to locating targets in video sequences. Though existing tracking-by-detection algorithms have shown to be greatly promising, they still suffer from the drift problem, which is caused by updating appearance models. In this paper, we propose a new appearance model composed of <b>ranking</b> middle-level <b>patches</b> to capture more object distinctiveness than traditional tracking-by-detection models. Targets and backgrounds are represented by both low-level bottom-up features and high-level top-down patches, which can compensate each other. Bottom-up features are defined at the pixel level, and each feature gets its discrimination score through selective feature attention mechanism. In top-down feature extraction, rectangular <b>patches</b> are <b>ranked</b> according to their bottom-up discrimination scores, by which all of them are clustered into irregular <b>patches,</b> named <b>ranking</b> middle-level <b>patches.</b> In addition, at the stage of classifier training, the online random forests algorithm is specially refined to reduce drifting problems. Experiments on challenging public datasets and our test videos demonstrate that our approach can effectively prevent the tracker drifting problem and obtain competitive performance in visual tracking...|$|R

Like Ginny I, the OSS members were properly dressed in U.S. Army uniforms and had no civilian clothes in them. Calcura, Tremonte, and Farrell wore paratrooper boots with the others wearing regulation G.I. shoes with canvas leggings. They also wore knit stocking caps and had their jackets inside-out. They wore no distinctive markings that indicated the branch of OSS so the only insignia the OSS men had were U.S. Army <b>ranks</b> <b>patched</b> on either their sleeves of shirts or their field jackets. The men all were armed with Colt.45 automatic pistols and Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knives with six of the team carrying 9-mm Marlin submachine guns.|$|R

40|$|The work of {{this thesis}} is {{in the area of}} proof complexity, an area which looks to uncover the {{limitations}} of proof systems. In this thesis we investigate the rank complexity of tautologies for several of the most important proof systems based on integer linear programming methods. The three main contributions of this thesis are as follows: Firstly we develop the ﬁrst rank lower bounds for the proof system based on the Sherali-Adams operator and show that both the Pigeonhole and Least Number Principles require linear rank in this system. We also demonstrate a link between the complexity measures of Sherali-Adams rank and Resolution width. Secondly we present a novel method for deriving rank lower bounds in the well-studied Cutting Planes proof system. We use this technique to show that the <b>Cutting</b> Plane <b>rank</b> of the Pigeonhole Principle is logarithmic. Finally we separate the complexity measures of Resolution width and Sherali-Adams rank from the complexity measures of Lovasz and Schrijver <b>rank</b> and <b>Cutting</b> Planes <b>rank.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Clickthrough data is a {{critical}} feature for improving web search ranking. Recently, many search portals have provided aggregated search, which retrieves relevant information from various heterogeneous collections called verticals. In addition tothe well-known problem of rank bias, clickthrough data recorded in the aggregated search environment suffers from severe sparseness problems due to {{the limited number of}} results presented for each vertical. This skew in clickthrough data, which we call <b>rank</b> <b>cut,</b> makes optimization of vertical searches more difficult. In this work, we focus on mitigating the negative effect of <b>rank</b> <b>cut</b> for aggregated vertical searches. We introduce a technique for smoothing click counts based on spectral graph analysis. Using real clickthrough data from a vertical recorded in an aggregated search environment, we show empirically that clickthrough data smoothed by this technique is effective for improving the vertical search. ...|$|R

The analysis of the achieved results shows that, in general, the incremental process improves the tracing accuracy and reduces the effort to analyse the proposed links. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
