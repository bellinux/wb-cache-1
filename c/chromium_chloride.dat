500|$|Andrés Manuel del Río {{discovered}} compounds of vanadium in 1801 in Mexico {{by analyzing}} a new lead-bearing mineral he called [...] "brown lead", and presumed its qualities {{were due to}} the presence of a new element, which he named erythronium (derived from Greek for [...] "red") since, upon heating, most of the salts turned red.

Na adsorption on Cr(100) results {{in the formation of}} positively charged, ordered monolayers, exhibiting strong lateral repuisions and a heat of adsorption of 175 kJ mol- 1 at low coverages; subsequent exposure to oxygen brings about oxidation of the Na phase and the underlying Cr(100) lattice. Coadsorption of Na and Cl on Cr(100) causes island formation of (100) -oriented NaCl and implies an appreciable lateral mobility for the surface species at 300 K; at high chlorine coverages evidence is presented suggesting formation of CrCl 2 and a mixed CrNaxCl 2 +x corrosion phase. Na adsorption on outgassed Cr 2 O 3 exhibits characteristics similar to the interaction of alkalis with transition metals, although the Na is more strongly bound than on Cr(100). When heated in the presence of oxygen, reaction of adsorbed Na with the underlying Cr 2 O 3 lattice takes place, resulting in formation of a mixed Na-Cr-O compound. Chlorine adsorption on the outgassed Cr 2 O 3 surface results in the appearance of two TDS states, chlorine being evolved at low temperatures and <b>chromium</b> <b>chloride(s)</b> desorbing at high temperatures.
