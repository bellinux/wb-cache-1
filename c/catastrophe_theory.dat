Complex models with constant parameters often approach a steady state. In this research, we present {{an overview of}} mathematical approaches applied to the description of control population tumor cells. We are researching the influence of D-factor on tumor cells population. We called it compensatory effect. There is Vaccination as biological analogue of the compensator effect. D-factor is presented as <b>catastrophe</b> <b>theory’s</b> fold form. Further, numeric results of model experiments are showing that this approach is positive efficient...|$|R
40|$|Theories on superheating-melting mostly involve {{vibrational}} {{and mechanical}} instabilities, catastrophes of entropy, volume and rigidity, and nucleation-based kinetic models. The maximum achievable superheating is dictated by nucleation process of melt in crystals, {{which in turn}} depends on material properties and heating rates. We have established the systematics for maximum superheating by incorporating a dimensionless nucleation barrier parameter and heating rate, with which systematic molecular dynamics simulations and dynamic experiments are consistent. Detailed microscopic investigation with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of the superheating-melting process, and structure-resolved ultrafast dynamic experiments are necessary to establish {{the connection between the}} kinetic limit of superheating and vibrational and mechanical instabilities, and <b>catastrophe</b> <b>theories...</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to a 2009 {{study by}} Liviu Giosan, Florin Filip, and Stefan Constatinescu, the {{level in the}} Black Sea before the marine {{reconnection}} was 30 m below present sea level, rather than the 80 m, or lower, of the <b>catastrophe</b> <b>theories.</b> If the flood occurred at all, the sea level increase and the flooded area during the reconnection were significantly smaller than previously proposed. It also occurred earlier than initially surmised, [...] 7400 BCE, rather than the originally proposed 5600 BCE. Since {{the depth of the}} Bosphorus, in its middle furrow, at present varies from 36 to 124 m, with an average depth of 65 m, a calculated stone age shoreline in the Black Sea lying 30 m lower than in the present day would imply that the contact with the Mediterranean may never have been broken during the Holocene, and hence there could have been no sudden waterfall-style transgression.|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{premised on the}} {{assumption}} of a radical gradualism {{in the emergence of}} language in opposition to <b>catastrophe</b> <b>theories</b> advocating its sudden birth. On this hypothesis, the paper argues against the view that the evolution of language has meant a loss of iconicity. Instead, I claim that while iconicity has been eliminated from the arbitrary signifier it has been retained and refined {{at the level of the}} motivated signified. In support of this claim I place imaginability at the hub of language, as the human capacity for the mental variation of perception and an indispensable component of the linguistic sign. The main vehicles of iconicity are shown to be aboutness and voice, with protosyntax functioning as a forerunner to linguistic syntax. Only once we acknowledge that language is not a symbolic system but rather a heterosemiotic hybrid, with a capacity to accommodate symbolicity, the paper concludes, will we be in a position to do justice to the emergence of language from its nonverbal precursors. © 2016, Linguistic and Philosophical Investigations...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, {{management}} agencies {{require that}} the remediation of eutrophic waters be addressed {{at the level of}} the whole ecosystem. One whole-system approach to quantify ecosystems is called ecological network analysis. Ascendency theory, the branch of the field that deals with the quantification of whole-system status, specifically addresses the definition of eutrophication. This definition has been applied to data taken over a gradient of eutrophication. Three separate areas were observed: a non-eutrophic area (with Zostera noltii meadows), an intermediate eutrophic area (Z. noltii absent and macroalgae abundant at times) and a strongly eutrophic area (where Enteromorpha spp. blooms occur with regularity). Pulse eutrophication was considered as the major driving force behind a gradual shift in primary producers from a community dominated by rooted macrophytes (Z. noltii) to a community dominated by green macroalgae. The measures associated with the intermediate eutrophic region turned out not to be intermediate to those at the gradient extremes. The most likely explanation appears to be the highly unstable nature of this area. Conditions along the spatial gradient are discussed as representing various stages in the temporal evolution of the system, and analysed in the framework of the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, Bifurcation, Chaos, and <b>Catastrophe</b> <b>theories.</b> [URL]...|$|R

25|$|As {{anthropogenic}} {{greenhouse gas}} emissions reduce {{the stability of the}} global climate, abrupt climate change could become more intense. The impact of an asteroid or comet larger than about 1km diameter has the potential to block the sun globally, causing impact winter. Particles in the troposphere would quickly rain out, but particles in the stratosphere, especially sulfate, could remain there for years. Similarly, a supervolcanic eruption would reduce the potential of agricultural production from solar photosynthesis, causing volcanic winter. The Toba super volcanic eruption approximately 70,000 years ago may have nearly caused the extinction of humans (see Toba <b>catastrophe</b> <b>theory).</b> Again, primarily sulfate particles could block the sun for years. Solar blocking is not limited to natural causes as nuclear winter is also possible, which refers to the scenario involving widespread nuclear war and burning of cities that release soot into the stratosphere that would stay there for about 10 years. The high stratospheric temperatures produced by soot absorbing solar radiation would create near-global ozone hole conditions even for a regional nuclear conflict.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a computational stochastic model of virtual cells irradiation, based on Quasi-Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and using biophysical input. The model {{is based on}} a stochastic tree of probabilities for each cell of the entire colony. Biophysics of the cells is described by probabilities and probability distributions provided as the input. The adaptation of nucleation and <b>catastrophe</b> <b>theories,</b> well known in physics, yields sigmoidal relationships for carcinogenic risk {{as a function of the}} irradiation. Adaptive response and bystander effect, incorporated into the model, improves its application. The results show that behavior of virtual cells can be successfully modeled, e. g. cancer transformation, creation of mutations, radioadaptation or radiotherapy. The used methodology makes the model universal and practical for simulations of general processes. Potential biophysical curves and relationships are also widely discussed in the paper. However, the presented theoretical model does not describe the real cells and tissues. Also the exposure geometry (e. g., uniform or non-uniform exposure), type of radiation (e. g., X-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, heavy ions, etc.) as well as microdosimetry are not presently addressed. The model is focused mainly on creation of general and maximal wide mathematical description of irradiated hypothetical cells treated as complex physical systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} buckling and postbuckling {{behavior of}} rectangular plates in symmetric and antisymmetric modes is re-examined, {{in the context}} of Bifurcation and <b>Catastrophe</b> <b>Theories,</b> using a two-degrees-of-freedom model, which has been adopted for the same purpose in the pioneer literature. At first the perfect system is dealt with in detail, symbolically utilizing the exact as well as the approximate equilibrium equations, the latter being products of a universal unfolding of the original total potential energy function. Conditions for the existence of remote secondary bifurcations are fully assessed and the stability of critical states is determined, revealing sudden qualitative changes in the postbuckling response of the perfect system, which have been also reported for the actual continuous structural system-the rectangular plate-using the von Karman equations. Thereafter, the imperfection sensitivity is dealt with, introducing symmetric as well as asymmetric imperfections, considered as individual or consecutive perturbations of the perfect system. It is found that symmetry breaking bifurcations give birth to complicated cusp singularities, which may lead to unexpected jumps from one to two-mode remote postbuckling behavior. Finally, considering the general case of random imperfections, higher order two-mode singularities are revealed, mainly of the double-cusp catastrophe type, which have been also discovered in the postbuckling response of rectangular plates, a fact validating the choice of the foregoing nonlinear simulation.

40|$|Government {{agencies}} have adopted an ecosystem approach to ecosystem management as the mandated form for managing ecological systems. This review paper {{will provide a}} detailed summary of the ecosystem management debate. The first section will discuss {{the development of the}} ecosystem approach, and address the key questions and issues surrounding the ecosystem management debate. The second section focuses on the important principles and themes that should be part of a successful ecosystem management strategy. There is no precise definition of ecosystem management. In time there will be a need for a precise definition as this will assist managers and policy makers and everyone involved in ecosystem management. However, as ecosystem management is evolving, it should be left to being defined by its for now. That said, it must be acknowledged that ecosystem management be based on the ecosystem approach, an approach based on complex systems theory. Its principles are based on hierarchy theory, self-organization, chaos and <b>catastrophe</b> <b>theories,</b> and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. When thought of in this manner ecosystem management does truly represent a paradigm shift in the management of ecological systems. Ecosystem science should form the basis of ecosystem management, however the role of the social sciences needs to be expanded. For ecosystem management to be successful the analysis of the ecosystem must be done within the context of an adaptive management process. Further institutional changes are needed if ecosystem management is to succeed. These include organizational change, interagency cooperation and changing the way ecosystem science and management are taught. 1. ...|$|R

40|$|Eutrophication {{became a}} {{dominant}} {{process in the}} Mondego estuarine system in the 1980 s, presumably {{as a result of}} excessive nutrient release into coastal waters. The main symptoms were the occurrence of seasonal blooms of Enteromorpha spp., green macroalgae, and a drastic reduction of the Zostera noltii meadows. Previous results suggest that this process will determine changes in species composition at other trophic levels. This paper aims at integrating the available information to provide a theoretical interpretation of the recent physicochemical and biological changes in the Mondego estuarine ecosystem, which will be further used as basic framework {{for the development of a}} structurally dynamic model. Exergy-based indices, the Exergy Index and Specific Exergy, were applied as ecological indicators (orientors) to describe the state of the ecosystem, taking into account different scenarios along a spatial gradient of eutrophication symptoms. This allowed elucidating the present conditions along the spatial gradient as representing various stages in the temporal evolution of the system, within the framework of bifurcation, Chaos, and <b>Catastrophe</b> <b>theories.</b> Eutrophication appeared as the major driving force behind the gradual shift in primary producers from a community dominated by rooted macrophytes (Z. noltii) to a community dominated by green macroalgae. Through time, concomitant changes at other trophic levels will most probably give origin to a new trophic structure. Moreover, river management emerged as a key question in establishing scenarios in order to determine secondary effects in eutrophied systems. Results suggest that a more conservative river management may be used as a powerful tool to remedy affected areas, including the implementation of ecological engineering principles in different possible management practices. The recent biological changes in the Mondego estuarine ecosystem were found to comply with the framework of the theories considered, while both Exergy-based indices were able to capture the state of the system and distinguish between different scenarios.
