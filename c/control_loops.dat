Discrete electronic analogue controllers have been largely replaced by digital controllers using microcontrollers or FPGAs, to implement PID algorithms. However, discrete analog PID controllers are still used in niche applications requiring high-bandwidth and low-noise performance, such as laser-diode controllers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to merge my on the job marine {{experience}} and the control knowledge gathered throughout my studies at University of California San Diego into a practical control design. This thesis creates a Dynamic Positioning (DP) <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> for a supply vessel which utilizes two azimuthal thrusters as actuators. The <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> is designed to also account for external environmental disturbances and sensor measurement noise. The <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> is accomplished using modern control theory which makes use of known vessel dynamics and assumptions associated with the environment and sensor measurement variances. During this thesis research and design period, a testing platform for the <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> was required. Without the ability to retrofit a physical vessel with the proposed azimuthal thrusters it was determined that a simulation model would be required and was designed and implemented in Matlab Simulink to allow for <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> testing and validation. This simulation model is presented as part of the thesis research and design flow as it was a required element of the design and encompasses the knowledge acquired in my marine work and during my period at UCSD. <b>Control</b> <b>loop</b> performance results were obtained through testing on the generated simulation model. These results allowed for validation and optimization during the design phases of the vessel <b>control</b> <b>loop.</b> The principal conclusions were that the simulation model provided sufficient dynamics to properly execute the required tests to the <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> and that the implemented <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> was capable of operating within the determined parameters set forth in the design validation testin...|$|R

40|$|In the {{feedback}} <b>control</b> <b>loop,</b> uncertainty is associated to different sources (e. g., the environment), and appears in different forms (e. g., as noise in variables or imperfections in techniques being used). In the MAPE-K <b>control</b> <b>loop,</b> uncertainty is normally {{handled by the}} decision maker at the Plan stage.

40|$|The time-average method {{currently}} available {{is limited to}} analyzing the specific performance of the automatic gain control-proportional and integral (AGC-PI) based velocity-controlled closed-loop in a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) vibratory gyroscope, since {{it is hard to}} solve nonlinear functions in the time domain when the <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> reaches to 3 rd order. In this paper, we propose a linearization design approach to overcome this limitation by establishing a 3 rd order linear model of the <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> and transferring the analysis to the frequency domain. Order reduction is applied on the built linear model’s transfer function by constructing a zero-pole doublet, and therefore mathematical expression of each <b>control</b> <b>loop’s</b> performance specification is obtained. Then an optimization methodology is summarized, which reveals that a robust, stable and swift <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> can be achieved by carefully selecting the system parameters following a priority order. Closed-loop drive circuits are designed and implemented using 0. 35 μm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, and experiments carried out on a gyroscope prototype verify the optimization methodology that an optimized stability of the <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> can be achieved by constructing the zero-pole doublet, and disturbance rejection capability (D.
