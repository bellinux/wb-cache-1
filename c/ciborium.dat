5|$|As he lies dying {{under the}} abbey's rubble, Zerchi is startled to {{encounter}} Mrs Grales/Rachel, a bicephalous tomato peddler and mutant. However, Mrs. Grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion, {{and may be}} dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the <b>ciborium</b> and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, Eve and Jesus, exempt from original sin, and may even be the Second Coming of Christ to begin a new cycle on Earth. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.|$|E
5|$|During the cease-fire, {{the abbey}} offers shelter to {{refugees}} fleeing the regions affected by fallout, {{which results in}} a battle of wills over euthanasia between the abbot and a doctor from a government emergency response camp. The war resumes, and a nuclear explosion occurs near the abbey. Abbot Zerchi tries to flee to safety, bringing with him the abbey's <b>ciborium</b> containing consecrated hosts, {{but it is too}} late. He is trapped by the falling walls of the abbey, and finds himself lying under tons of rock and bones as the abbey's ancient crypts disgorge their contents. Among them is a skull with an arrow's shaft protruding from its forehead (presumably that of Brother Francis Gerard from the first section of the book).|$|E
5|$|In 1610 the Constable {{gave the}} cup to a convent in Medina de Pomar, near Burgos, as the {{inscription}} describes. His deed of gift survives, and records that the gift was on condition that the cup was never alienated by the convent. A marginal note on the deed, in the Constable's own handwriting, records that he had obtained {{the permission of the}} Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, for {{the cup to}} be used as a <b>ciborium,</b> or container for consecrated hosts. By this period a rule of the church normally forbade the use of vessels decorated on their inner surface as ciboria.|$|E
25|$|The silver {{collection}} contains just under 1,300 {{pieces from the}} 15th to 19th centuries, and is {{recognized as one of}} the most important in Mexico. The pieces include repoussé work, chiseling, graffito and filigree, along with pieces set with precious and semi-precious stones and those containing enamels and others with gold. Most are pieces related to Catholic liturgy and include censers, chalices, lamps, candlesticks, <b>ciboriums,</b> crosses and tabernacles, but there are also non-religious pieces such as gold cigarette cases, cutlery, plays and trays.|$|R

25|$|When placed {{close to}} a wall or {{touching}} it, altars were often surmounted by a reredos or altarpiece. If free-standing, they could be placed, as also in Eastern Christianity, within a <b>ciborium</b> (sometimes called a baldachin).|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{houses a}} Madonna with Saints by Lorenzo Costa the Younger and a Pietà by Amico Aspertini. Also the colours {{of the walls}} and the stained glass windows are noteworthy. The choir was made in the 15th century by Agostino de' Marchi, while the <b>ciborium</b> is a work by Vignola.|$|E
25|$|Main Chapel: {{the altar}} {{contains}} a 15th-century wooden crucifix. At the back, a fresco of the ‘’Madonna with St. Petronio’’ by Marcantonio Franceschini and Luigi Quaini, cartoons by Cignani (1672). The <b>ciborium</b> {{of the main}} altar was built in 1547 by Vignola. The fifteenth-century wooden choir was completed by Agostino de 'Marchi.|$|E
50|$|Gallery three {{shows how}} churches were {{constructed}} in the Spanish era and shows photographs as well as actual building materials used. The fourth gallery is a gathering of Saints, exhibiting a collection of statues of saints from various parishes, including one of St. Joseph at his deathbed. The fifth gallery is a display of chalices and <b>ciboriums,</b> of priestly vestments and other accoutrements of the liturgy of the Mass and the sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church. The sixth gallery is a sample bedroom of a priest.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} {{destroyed}} by a massive fire in 1949, known as the Great Fire of Meycauayan. Artifacts such as old memorabilia, statues, church vestments, records, <b>ciboriums</b> and chalices {{are some of the}} casualties of the fire. The retablo in the Colonial style was destroyed. Only a few church items including the tabernacle were saved from the fire. It was saved from destruction by Fr. Jorge Capistrano (It is still in use today). After its destruction, a committee was formed for the reconstruction of the present church by the priests together with Anselmo de Leon as its head, which campaigned for donations and help from the people for the church's restoration.|$|R
50|$|Pre-Romanesque Croatian {{churches are}} also the most {{important}} historical sources of that time because on their beams and tympanums of altar fences, as well on some portals and <b>ciboriums</b> we found many names of Croatian kings, dukes and nobleman which are mentioned as patrons and builders of those churches. The oldest one is from church in Rižinice (Solin) which mentions Croatian duke Trpimir (PRO DVCE TREPIMERO), from around year 850, while on the inscription of duke Branimir from year 888 we have the oldest mention of Croats: CRVATORVM. On the rest from 10th century we found the names of dukes Muncimir of Croatia, Držislav and Svetislav, {{all the way to}} king Zvonimir {{from the end of the}} 11th century.That inscription of king Zvonimir is already made in Croatian language, written in Glagolitic script (Baška tablet).|$|R
25|$|The adoration {{may also}} take place when the Eucharist is not exposed but {{left in a}} <b>ciborium,</b> which is {{likewise}} placed on an altar or in an enclosed tabernacle so that the faithful may pray in its presence {{without the need for}} volunteers to be in constant attendance (as is required when the Blessed Sacrament is exposed).|$|E
25|$|The {{sanctuary}} {{is often}} {{separated from the}} body of the church by railings and screens, and, in the case of Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, by an iconostasis which forms a complete visual as well as physical barrier. The sanctuary is usually the most ornately decorated part of a church, creating a visual focus towards the altar. This might be done in several ways. There might be a carved or painted altarpiece, a large carved screen called a reredos, or a structure called a <b>ciborium</b> which form a canopy over the altar. In English churches that have a square eastern end, a very large stained glass window often fills the wall behind the altar.|$|E
25|$|Fragments of the {{sculpture}} of the Nativity {{believed to be}} by 13th-century Arnolfo di Cambio were transferred to beneath the altar of the large Sistine Chapel off the right transept of the church. This chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is named after Pope Sixtus V, and {{is not to be}} confused with the Sistine Chapel of the Vatican, named after Pope Sixtus IV. The architect Domenico Fontana designed the chapel, which contains the tombs of Sixtus V himself and of his early patron Pope Pius V. The main altar in the chapel has four gilded bronze angels by Sebastiano Torregiani, holding up the <b>ciborium,</b> which is a model of the chapel itself.|$|E
50|$|The decorations at western {{sides of}} the eastern columns (i.e. the frescoes which were turned towards the {{congregation}} in the mainspace) are the best preserved in all the church. The Annunciation is shown {{on the top of}} the columns. According to the tradition, the figures of Gabriel and Our Lady are painted on separate columns: that is supposed to create an impression of the scene to take place in the church's space. The figures of the Holy Unmercenaries (Florus and Laurus, Cyrus and John) are placed under the picture of the Annunciation. While one pair of the unmercenaries holds in hands vessels that look like <b>ciboriums,</b> another one has scrolls in their hands. This is to draw a parallel between body healing and soul healing according to the Christian doctrine. Moreover, the figures are flanked near the altar, that points to the congregation where this healing is likely to be found.|$|R
2500|$|Those {{who were}} {{converted}} by St. Thomas in the 1st century continued worshiping in synagogues. Then {{they moved to}} their homes and by the 2nd century, they began {{to build their own}} churches (called ‘’Palli’’) in various places. It is believed that there were such small gatherings at Maliankara, Piravom, Niranam (Nelcynda) and Nilakkal. St. Thomas Christians in Kerala, still construct their churches combining the design of Solomon's temple at Jerusalem, and Indian Vastu Shastra. So from outside it looks like a Hindu temple but inside it is like a Jewish temple. It is divided into Sanctuary (Madbaha) and Nave (Haickala). MarThoma Churches are built east west with the Sanctuary (Madbaha) to the east. [...] East is the place of the rising suns that is the symbol of the Risen Christ and His Second coming. East also symbolizes the Garden of Eden that was situated at the east. The Sanctuary is separated {{from the rest of the}} place by a veil with the sign of a cross. The worship of the Eastern churches symbolizes the heavenly worship. Madbaha symbolically represents Heaven and Haickala, the earth and veil the sky. The Madbaha is demarcated from the bema with an open arch and a veil. At the beginning of Holy Qurbana Service the veil is drawn from right side to left. Marthoma Syrians have abandoned the West syriac tradition of erecting more than one Altar and Madhbaha in Church and also forbade dedication of Altar/Thronos in name of a Saint or a Holy church father and conducting Holy Qurbana at Altar simultaneously or separate. The pulpit and lectern are also usually found at the extension of the bema. Bema is demarcated from the nave and transept(widely uses a vestibule space before the nave) with altar rails. The Choir is seated at one end of the transepts in the same level of the nave. Now there is a tendency to follow western architectural designs and introducing <b>ciboriums,</b> semi-domes...etc.|$|R
25|$|The dual sepulchral and heavenly {{symbolism}} {{was adopted}} by early Christians in both the use of domes in architecture and in the <b>ciborium,</b> a domical canopy like the baldachin used as a ritual covering for relics or the church altar. The celestial symbolism of the dome, however, was the preeminent one by the Christian era. In the early centuries of Islam, domes were closely associated with royalty. A dome built {{in front of the}} mihrab of a mosque, for example, was at least initially meant to emphasize the place of a prince during royal ceremonies. Over time such domes became primarily focal points for decoration or the direction of prayer. The use of domes in mausoleums can likewise reflect royal patronage or be seen as representing the honor and prestige that domes symbolized, rather than having any specific funerary meaning. The wide variety of dome forms in medieval Islam reflected dynastic, religious, and social differences as much as practical building considerations.|$|E
25|$|If we draw {{a square}} and divide each side into three {{so that the}} middle parts are greater than the others, and then divide the area into nine from these points, we {{approximate}} to the typical setting out of a plan of this time. Now add three apses {{on the east side}} opening from the three divisions, and opposite to the west put a narrow entrance porch running right across the front. Still in front put a square court. The court is the atrium and usually has a fountain in the middle under a canopy resting on pillars. The entrance porch is the narthex. Directly under the center of the dome is the ambo, from which the Scriptures were proclaimed, and beneath the ambo at floor level was the place for the choir of singers. Across {{the eastern side of the}} central square was a screen which divided off the bema, where the altar was situated, from the body of the church; this screen, bearing images, is the iconostasis. The altar was protected by a canopy or <b>ciborium</b> resting on pillars. Rows of rising seats around the curve of the apse with the patriarch's throne at the middle eastern point formed the synthronon. The two smaller compartments and apses at the sides of the bema were sacristies, the diaconicon and prothesis. The ambo and bema were connected by the solea, a raised walkway enclosed by a railing or low wall.|$|E
500|$|The nave extends into a high vaulted apse (pictured right) at {{the east}} end. The aisles {{on either side of}} the nave are {{continued}} around the apse, making an ambulatory. Seven chandeliers are suspended from the ceiling over the main aisle. Beneath the chancel arch stands the high altar, under an ornate baldachin. The <b>ciborium</b> over the high altar bears the Latin words Venite Adoremus Dominum, [...] "Come adore the Lord." [...] Within the sanctuary stands a second, portable, altar, upon which most masses are celebrated.|$|E
500|$|The setting {{represents}} the Mass– the angels are clothed in Eucharistic vestments, with {{those on the}} far right dressed in a deacon's cope. None wear the celebrant's chasuble, suggesting Christ is the priest. The shed roof is a <b>ciborium</b> over an altar. A later addition to the painting, added perhaps in the 17th century, and since removed, was a gold paten on which the infant lay, clearly showing Jesus as the Eucharistic host. Mary, Joseph and the angels are the first to worship the infant Christ and the shed [...] "becomes the altar of the first mass". Upton explains that when viewed {{in the context of the}} first mass the iconography is more clearly defined.|$|E
500|$|Another {{traditional}} assumption, {{based on}} {{the language of the}} inventories and shared by almost all writers, was that the cup was a piece of secular plate, for use at table, or display on a buffet beside it. The buffet of the period was more like a modern Welsh dresser or shop display unit, with receding shelves for displaying on important occasions all the plate of the household that was not in use. [...] Neil Stratford suggests that the cup was only used to drink from on special occasions, including St Agnes' feast day, while Lightbown remarks that at over four pounds in weight the cup is much too heavy to drink from conveniently. [...] However John Cherry, noting the exclusively religious subjects depicted (including that on the lost tripod stand) considers that the cup may have been intended as a <b>ciborium</b> from the start. It might have been used either to accompany in its carrying case the duke on his tours of his many castles and palaces, or perhaps for his foundation of the Saint Chapelle at his capital of Bourges, intended to rival the king's Sainte-Chapelle in Paris and his brother's foundation at Champmol in Dijon.|$|E
2500|$|In ecclesiastical architecture, a <b>ciborium</b> ("ciborion": [...] κιβώριον in Greek) is {{a canopy}} or {{covering}} supported by columns, freestanding in the sanctuary, that stands over and covers the altar in a basilica or other church. [...] It {{may also be}} known by the more general term of baldachin, though <b>ciborium</b> is often considered more correct for examples in churches. Early ciboria had curtains hanging from rods between the columns, so that the altar could be concealed from the congregation at points in the liturgy. Smaller examples may cover other objects in a church. In a very large church, a <b>ciborium</b> is an effective way of visually highlighting the altar, and emphasizing its importance. The altar and <b>ciborium</b> are often set upon a dais to raise it above {{the floor of the}} sanctuary.|$|E

2500|$|In early churches, {{including}} the [...] "Great Church" [...] Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, the altar, {{at least in}} large churches, was under a <b>ciborium</b> ("ciborion": κιβωριου in Greek), usually a structure with four columns and a domed canopy. [...] This had curtains on rods on all four sides, which were closed for sections of the liturgy, as is still performed in the Coptic and Armenian churches. a comparison with the biblical Veil of the Temple was intended. [...] The small domed structures, usually with red curtains, that are often shown near the writing saint in early Evangelist portraits, especially in the East, represent a <b>ciborium,</b> as do the structures surrounding many manuscript portraits of medieval rulers. As the iconostasis grew, the <b>ciborium</b> declined, although some late examples, by now invisible to the congregation, were produced.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cover of}} the Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, which can be {{precisely}} dated to 870, is probably {{a product of the}} same workshop, though there are differences of style. [...] This workshop is associated with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles II (the Bald), and often called his [...] "Palace School". [...] Its location (if it had a fixed one) remains uncertain and much discussed, but Saint-Denis Abbey outside Paris is one leading possibility. [...] The Arnulf <b>Ciborium</b> (a miniature architectural <b>ciborium</b> rather than the vessel for hosts), now in the Munich Residenz, is the third major work in the group, along with the frame of an antique serpentine dish in the Louvre. Recent scholars tend to group the Lindau Gospels and the Arnulf <b>Ciborium</b> in closer relation to each other than the Codex Aureus to either.|$|E

2500|$|The Early Medieval Eastern Orthodox church [...] "directed {{that the}} eucharist be celebrated at an altar with a <b>ciborium,</b> from which hung the vessel {{in which the}} consecrated host was kept", the vessel {{sometimes}} being {{in the form of}} a dove. [...] Early depictions of the Last Supper in Christian art, showing the Communion of the Apostles, show them queueing to receive the bread and wine from Christ, who stands under or beside a <b>ciborium,</b> presumably reflecting contemporary liturgical practice. [...] An example of this type is in mosaic in the apse of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, under a very large standing Virgin.|$|E
2500|$|Worthington's {{design was}} {{published}} in The Builder on 27 September 1862, before Scott's final design was unveiled. However, writing in his Recollections, Gilbert Scott suggested his own design was original: My idea in designing the Memorial was to erect a kind of <b>ciborium</b> to protect a statue of the Prince; and its special characteristic was that the <b>ciborium</b> was designed in some degree {{on the principles of}} the ancient shrines. These shrines were models of imaginary buildings, such as had never in reality been erected; and my idea was to realise one of these imaginary structures with its precious materials, its inlaying, its enamels, etc. etc. ... this was an idea so new as to provoke much opposition.|$|E
2500|$|Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola {{was chief}} {{architect}} of the fabbrica; his is {{the design of the}} <b>ciborium</b> over the altar. The vaulting and decoration of the central nave is by Girolamo Rainaldi, who completed them in 1646-1658. The twenty-two chapels are the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gothic Revival saw {{the true}} {{free-standing}} <b>ciborium</b> return to some popularity: the Votive Church, Vienna {{has a large}} Gothic example designed in 1856, and Ninian Comper built a number, including one for Pusey House. Peterborough Cathedral has a neo-Gothic example, and Derby Cathedral one with the Romanesque small columns below a neo-classical architrave and pediment. Westminster Cathedral, a neo-Byzantine building, has a splayed version of 1894, with extra flanking columns, which within that context is [...] "resolutely modernistic". [...] The Gothic style of <b>ciborium</b> was also borrowed for some public monuments like the Albert Memorial in London, {{as it had been}} in the Middle Ages for the outdoor Scaliger Tombs in Verona. [...] For other post-Renaissance versions, many variations of the basic square four-column plan, see the next section.|$|E
2500|$|Possibly the {{earliest}} important example over an altar {{was in the}} Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome, also donated by Constantine, looted by the Visigoths in the 5th century and now replaced by a large Gothic structure (see below). [...] This {{is described as a}} fastigium in {{the earliest}} sources, but was probably a <b>ciborium.</b> [...] Like most major early examples it was [...] "of silver", whose weight is given, presumably meaning that decorated silver plaques were fixed to a wood or stone framework. [...] No early examples in precious metal have survived, but many are recorded in important churches. Possibly the earliest <b>ciborium</b> to survive largely complete is one in Sant'Apollinare in Classe in Ravenna (not over the main altar), which is dated to 806-810, though the columns of the example at Sant'Ambrogio appear to date from the original 4th-century church.|$|E
2500|$|A {{very famous}} <b>ciborium</b> that {{apparently}} did not stand over an altar was one that apparently functioned as a quasi-reliquary shrine or symbolic tomb for the missing remains of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki in Hagios Demetrios, the large and important church erected in Thessaloniki over the mass grave {{in which he was}} traditionally buried. [...] This appears, from various accounts of miracles associated with it, and depictions in mosaic, to have been a free-standing roofed structure inside the church, at one side of the nave, with doors or walls in precious metal all around it. It was hexagonal and made of or covered with silver; inside there was a couch or bed. The roof had flat triangular panels rising shallowly to a central point. [...] It was rebuilt at least once. [...] A medium-sized 13th-century <b>ciborium</b> in a corner of San Marco, Venice, known as the capitello ("little chapel"), was used for the display of important icons and relics in the Middle Ages.|$|E
2500|$|Ciboria are {{now much}} rarer in churches in both East and West, as the {{introduction}} of other structures that screened the altar, such as the iconostasis in the East and rood screen and pulpitum in the West, meant {{that they would be}} little seen, and smaller examples often conflicted with the large altarpieces that came into fashion in the later Middle Ages. [...] They enjoyed something of a revival after the Renaissance once again opened up the view of the sanctuary, but never again became usual even in large churches. Bernini's enormous <b>ciborium</b> in Saint Peter's, Rome is a famous exception; it is the largest in existence, and always called a baldachin. [...] Many other elaborate aedicular Baroque altar surrounds that project from, but remain attached to, the wall behind, and have pairs of columns on each side, may be thought of as hinting at the <b>ciborium</b> without exactly using its form.|$|E
2500|$|Pope Urban VIII {{commissioned}} Gian Lorenzo Bernini {{to design}} and construct a large structure that would be placed over the main altar, believed to be above the tomb of Saint Peter, in the new St. Peter's Basilica.

[...] This famous and spectacular feature is generally called the [...] "Baldacchino", though strictly it is a <b>ciborium.</b>|$|E
