5|$|KSAT {{operates}} two polar ground stations {{optimized for}} low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the other being TrollSat at Troll in Antarctica. These {{are the only}} two ground stations able to see a polar-orbiting satellite on every revolution. By using both stations, customers <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> a satellite twice per orbit.|$|E
5|$|In the manga The Saga of Darren Shan, the titular {{character}} is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed {{one that he}} got when he was nine years old. He used {{to let them go}} into his mouth and he'd imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> spiders.|$|E
5|$|The Terrestrial Trunked Radio {{network has}} three {{components:}} the core net, {{which is a}} centralized computer center based on an Internet Protocol structure; the transmission net, which connects the core net, the radio net and other connection points with high-capacity lines; and the radio net, which consists of base stations with antennas in masts, on buildings and in some tunnels. The network is controlled by Motorola. In case a base station no longer <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> the core net, the base station can still relay communication within its range. Should the base station fall out or operations occur in areas without coverage, the terminals can communicate directly with each other.|$|E

5|$|Through SMS, users <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> Twitter {{through five}} gateway numbers: short codes for the United States, Canada, India, New Zealand, and an Isle of Man-based number for {{international}} use. There {{is also a}} short code in the United Kingdom which is only accessible to those on the Vodafone, O2 and Orange networks. In India, since Twitter only supports tweets from Bharti Airtel, an alternative platform called smsTweet {{was set up by}} a user to work on all networks. A similar platform called GladlyCast exists for mobile phone users in Singapore and Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Heathen deities are {{not seen}} as perfect, omnipotent, and omnipresent, and are instead viewed as having their own {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Many practitioners believe that these deities will one day die, as did, for instance, the god Baldr in Norse mythology. Heathens view their connection with their deities not as being that of a master and servant but rather as an interdependent relationship akin {{to that of a}} family. For them, these deities serve as both examples and role models whose behavior is to be imitated. Many practitioners believe that they <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> these deities, as well as negotiate, bargain, and argue with them, and hope that through venerating them, practitioners will gain wisdom, understanding, power, or visionary insights.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei, players {{take the}} role of an unnamed protagonist, a teenage boy who <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> demons using a {{computer}} program. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} other games in the series: players make their way through dungeons and fight against demons in a first-person perspective. The protagonist uses a variety of weapons and items, with the primary weapons being swords and guns. Such items are bought from merchants scattered around the world map. In special areas, the protagonist can use the in-game currency to restore health and magic points for themselves and their demons, remove status ailments, and revive fallen demons. Special Terminals scattered across the world map allow the player to save their game, and they can use them to teleport between terminals in different areas of Tokyo.|$|E

25|$|This {{procedure}} depends {{mainly on}} the receiver’s connectivity. It is possible to make a basic distinction between unidirectional networks, where the receiver can only receive information through the broadcast channel, and bidirectional networks, where {{there is also a}} return channel through which the receiver <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> the outside (typically an Internet access).|$|E
25|$|Not all {{powers in}} the Wheel of Time {{are related to the}} One Power or the ability to channel. Some {{individuals}} have the ability to interpret dreams or use them to predict the future (known as Dreaming). Others can predict the future through waking visions or inspired knowledge (Foretelling). Some individuals perceive auras with symbolic value, while others <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> animals in a telepathic manner.|$|E
25|$|The ARW is {{equipped}} with SINCGAR ITT, Harris and Racal communications equipment, which have an inbuilt encryption and frequency-hopping systems. It is also equipped with satellite communications, through the ARW C3 (Command, Control & Communications) function and {{in cooperation with the}} Communications and Information Services Corps (CIS). This means ARW teams <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> their GHQ from anywhere in the world. The Army Ranger Wing Intelligence Section has the ability to remotely intercept electronic and telephonic communications, working with the Directorate of Military Intelligence (G2) and Army CIS Corps.|$|E

25|$|If {{the hidden}} {{variables}} <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> each other faster than light, Bell's inequality {{can easily be}} violated. Once one particle is measured, it can communicate the necessary correlations to the other particle. Since in relativity the notion of simultaneity is not absolute, this is unattractive. One idea is to replace instantaneous communication with a process that travels backwards in time along the past light cone. This is the idea behind a transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics, which interprets the statistical emergence of a quantum history as a gradual coming to agreement between histories that go both forward and backward in time.|$|E
25|$|The player {{learns that}} Sara Oakheart {{is none other}} than Amarthiel, the legendary Champion of Angmar. She has set up a plot within a tower of Barad Gularan to use the player to weaken Mordirith. Now that she has the palantír, she <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> Sauron and {{challenge}} Mordirith's position. The player is sent to kill all of Mordirith's Knights, in an attempt to further weaken his power. But despite the player's victories over Mordirith, Amarthiel only grows stronger. After losing Fornost and Barad Gularan, she moves to Annúminas, the ancient capital of Arnor. The Rangers there, led by Calenglad, need the player's aid.|$|E
25|$|People {{are more}} likely to {{cooperate}} on a task if they <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> one another first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.|$|E

25|$|Turing's {{original}} article describes a simple party game involving three players. Player A is a man, player B {{is a woman}} and player C (who {{plays the role of}} the interrogator) is of either sex. In the Imitation Game, player C is unable to see either player A or player B, and <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> them only through written notes. By asking questions of player A and player B, player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman. Player A's role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision, while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the spread}} of Standard Chinese after the Nationalist Government retreated to Taiwan in 1949, Hakka Chinese and various Formosan {{languages}} are gradually no longer spoken within the new generation and many Formosan languages are therefore classified as moribund or endangered languages by the United Nations. Nowadays, only elder Hakka people living in Meinong, Liouguei, Shanlin and Jiasian districts can communicate in Hakka and elder Taiwanese aborigines living mostly in the rural districts of Namasia and Taoyuan <b>can</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> the aboriginal languages. Therefore, recently the Taiwanese government established Special affairs committee for both the Aboriginals (原住民事務委員會) and the Hakkas (客家事務委員會) to protect the language, culture {{and the rights of}} the two minorities.|$|E
