Radon emanating from the <b>cat</b> <b>litters,</b> encapsulated in an airtight container, produced equilibrium concentrations below 1. 2 pCi/g.

25|$|Oocysts in cat feces take {{at least}} a day to sporulate and become {{infectious}} after they are shed, so disposing of <b>cat</b> <b>litter</b> daily greatly reduces the chances of infectious oocysts being present in litter. As infectious oocysts from cat feces can spread and survive in the environment for months, humans should wear gloves when gardening or working with soil, and should wash their hands promptly after disposing of <b>cat</b> <b>litter.</b> The same precautions apply to outdoor sandboxes, which should be covered when not in use.|$|E
25|$|Cleaning <b>cat</b> <b>litter</b> boxes is a {{potential}} route of infection; however, numerous studies have shown living in a household with a cat is not a significant risk factor for T. gondii infection, though living with several kittens has some significance.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{properly}} preparing {{and cooking}} food. It is also recommended that pregnant women not clean <b>cat</b> <b>litter</b> boxes.

5000|$|In the Piedmontese language, {{the name}} Baratuciat {{is similar to}} the term used in the local dialect to denote cat's testicles, which ampelographers theorize may be a {{reference}} to the morphological shape of the grape's berries or to the characteristic [...] "Sauvignon blanc-like" [...] aromas of the grape, and wine made from it, which can be similar to a <b>cat's</b> <b>litter</b> box and elderflowers.|$|R
2500|$|... by ingesting water, soil, vegetables, or {{anything}} contaminated with oocysts shed in the feces of an infected animal. Cat fecal matter is particularly dangerous: Just one cyst consumed by a cat {{can result in}} thousands of oocysts. This is why physicians recommend pregnant or ill persons do not clean the <b>cat's</b> <b>litter</b> box at home. [...] These oocysts are resilient to harsh environmental conditions and can survive over a year in contaminated soil.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, {{pregnant}} or immunocompromised {{people are at}} higher risk of becoming infected or transmitting the parasite to their fetus. Because of this, they should not change or handle <b>cat</b> <b>litter</b> boxes. Ideally, cats should be kept indoors and only fed food that has low to no risk of carrying oocysts, such as commercial cat food or well-cooked table food.|$|E

A coop should be locked at night with all the chickens inside it, so that the chickens are protected from predators.|$|R

40|$|In {{a random}} sample of 103 sheep farms in Ontario, 99 % of the farms had some sheep serologically {{positive}} for Toxoplasma gondii, based on an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The percent of sheep affected within farms ranged from 3. 8 % to 97. 8 %, with an average flock prevalence of 57. 6 %. When farm management variables were considered in a multivariate analysis, significantly lower rates of serologically positive sheep were associated with neutering of female cats and clipping of ewes' perineums before lambing; significantly higher prevalence rates were found on farms where sheep were purchased from other flocks, pigs were raised on the same farm, sheep shared pasture with other animals, flowing water was available at pasture, and pastured replacements had access to housing. As well, in univariate analyses, higher prevalence was positively associated with an increasing number of <b>cat</b> <b>litters</b> born over the previous two years and offering creep feed or forage to lambs, and inversely with the amount of labor expended on sheep rearing...|$|R

Breen starts to sneeze, and Monk reveals his ace in the hole: Breen was sneezing explosively when they confronted him at his house. He claimed to have a cold, but Monk has just proven that he and Breen {{have one thing in}} common: they're both allergic to cats! The cat Natalie is carrying is one that Esther Stoval purchased just a few days before she was killed. Monk also remembers that he had a sneezing fit when he first met the homeless man who was later killed, and later had a similar fit when he was at the dead man's encampment. He initially thought that the man lived with cats, but there were no <b>cat</b> <b>litters</b> anywhere near the encampment.

40|$|In the Slavic folklore, a cat {{and similar}} other small animals with soft fur and {{numerous}} litters/offspring, represent symbols {{of a young}} female, bride woman, female genitals, home and hearth, appearing thus in fertility rituals, connected with food, knitting, weaving, and magic, {{but they are also}} associated with female demons, such as 'devour-eaters', 'child and harvest stealers'. All these are the cha­racteristics of the Great Mother Goddess, in her terrifying, chthonic appearance. The origin of the saying 'the first kittens should go down the drain' (should drawn in water) hence should be explained by the existence of the fertility rites, where the first litter of the cult animals was sacrificed to the Goddess in order to ensure future fertility; that is, the litter was thus 'returned' to the fertile water, as a symbol of mother's death. However, a more complete explanation requires ascertaining to an iconic meaning of the lexeme <b>cat</b> and <b>litter</b> which is the subject of the second part of this paper...|$|R

50|$|A University of California, Davis {{study of}} dead sea otters {{collected}} from 1998 to 2004 found toxoplasmosis {{was the cause}} of death for 13% of the animals. Proximity to freshwater outflows into the ocean was a major risk factor. Ingestion of oocysts from cat feces is considered to be the most likely ultimate source. Surface runoff containing wild <b>cat</b> feces and <b>litter</b> from domestic <b>cats</b> flushed down toilets are possible sources of oocysts. The parasites have been found in dolphins and whales. Researchers Black and Massie believe anchovies, which travel from estuaries into the open ocean, may be helping to spread the disease.|$|R
50|$|Siberian cats tend to {{come into}} {{reproductive}} readiness earlier than other breeds, sometimes as young as five months. It is thought that this {{is related to the}} breed's closeness to its natural wild state; feral cats often die young due to harsher natural conditions. Achieving reproductive ability early and having large litters provides a biological balance to this. On average, a Siberian litter consists of five to six kittens, as compared to the average litter of three to four kittens in breeds who have been registered as pedigreed <b>cats.</b> However, Siberian <b>litters</b> may consist of as few as one and as many as nine kittens.|$|R
