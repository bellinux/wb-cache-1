40|$|Sertoli cells play a {{significant}} role in regulating fetal testis compartmentalization to generate testis cords and interstitium during development. The Sertoli cell Wilms' tumor 1 (Wt 1) gene, which encodes ~ 24 zinc finger-containing transcription factors, is known to play a crucial role in fetal testis <b>cord</b> <b>assembly</b> and maintenance. However, whether Wt 1 regulates fetal testis compartmentalization by modulating the development of peritubular myoid cells (PMCs) and/or fetal Leydig cells (FLCs) remains unknown. Using a Wt 1 -/flox; Amh-Cre mouse model by deleting Wt 1 in Sertoli cells (Wt 1 SC-cKO) at embryonic day 14. 5 (E 14. 5), Wt 1 was found to regulate PMC and FLC development. Wt 1 deletion in fetal testis Sertoli cells caused aberrant differentiation and proliferation of PMCs, FLCs and interstitial progenitor cells from embryo to newborn, leading to abnormal fetal testis interstitial development. Specifically, the expression of PMC marker genes α-Sma, Myh 11 and Des, and interstitial progenitor cell marker gene Vcam 1 were down-regulated, whereas FLC marker genes StAR, Cyp 11 a 1, Cyp 17 a 1 and Hsd 3 b 1 were up-regulated, in neonatal Wt 1 SC-cKO testes. The ratio of PMC:FLC were also reduced in Wt 1 SC-cKO testes, concomitant with a down-regulation of Notch signaling molecules Jag 1, Notch 2, Notch 3, and Hes 1 in neonatal Wt 1 SC-cKO testes, illustrating changes in the differentiation status of FLC from their interstitial progenitor cells during fetal testis development. In summary, Wt 1 regulates the development of FLC and interstitial progenitor cell lineages through Notch signaling, and it also plays a role in PMC development. Collectively, these effects confer fetal testis compartmentalization...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, some {{residency}} programs in emergency medicine (EM) have implemented scholarly tracks into their curricula. The {{goal of the}} scholarly track is to identify a niche in which each trainee focuses his or her scholarly work during residency. The object {{of this paper is}} to discuss the current use, structure, and success of resident scholarly tracks. A working group of residency program leaders who had implemented scholarly tracks into their residency programs collated their approaches, implementation, and early outcomes through a survey disseminated through the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors (CORD) list-serve. At the 2009 <b>CORD</b> Academic <b>Assembly,</b> a session was held and attended by approximately 80 CORD members where the results were disseminated and discussed. The group examined the literature, discussed the successes and challenges faced during implementation and maintenance of the tracks, and developed a list of recommendations for successful incorporation of the scholarly track structure into a residency program. Our information comes from the experience at eight training programs (five 3 -year and three 4 -year programs), ranging from 8 to 14 residents per year. Two programs have been working with academic tracks for 8 [*]years. Recommendations included creating clear goals and objectives for each track, matching track topics with faculty expertise, protecting time for both faculty and residents, and providing adequate mentorship for the residents. In summary, scholarly tracks encourage the trainee to develop an academic or clinical niche within EM during residency training. The benefits include increased overall resident satisfaction, increased success at obtaining faculty and fellowship positions after residency, and increased production of scholarly work. We believe that this model will also encourage increased numbers of trainees to choose careers in academic medicine.

40|$|In {{order for}} a human being to process complex thought, cells within the brain must {{communicate}} with each other in a very precise manner. The mechanisms which underlie the development of these connections, however, are poorly understood and thus require a thorough investigation. In this dissertation, we attempt to identify components involved in stabilizing synaptic contacts and the mechanisms by which synaptic proteins are trafficked to newly forming contact sites. Interestingly, we also identify a gene involved {{in the formation of the}} myotome. To identify proteins involved in stabilizing synaptic contacts, we characterized the function of 4. 1 B in developing zebrafish embryos. 4. 1 B is a scaffolding molecule involved in stabilizing protein complexes at sites of cell adhesion. We identified two 4. 1 B genes in the zebrafish genome, 4. 1 B-a and 4. 1 B-b, which are differentially expressed and have evolved divergent functions. 4. 1 B-a is expressed within the central nervous system, specifically within primary motor neurons. Knockdown studies show a reduction in the number of synapses and altered kinetics of touch evoked-responses, suggesting a role in synaptic stabilization. In contrast, 4. 1 B-b is primarily expressed in muscle cells. Knockdown of 4. 1 B-b results in severe muscle fiber disorganization as well as altered locomotor behaviors. Together, these data suggest the basic functions of 4. 1 B are evolutionarily conserved, with new roles described in the development of synapses and muscle fibers. To determine the mechanisms that underlie protein recruitment to newly forming synapses, we examined the recruitment of three distinct transport packets in the zebrafish spinal <b>cord.</b> During presynaptic <b>assembly,</b> we found synaptic vesicle protein transport vesicles preceded piccolo-containing active zone precursor transport vesicles, which in turn preceded synapsin transport vesicles. We identified the last transport packet as a unique and independent mechanism for the recruitment of synapsin, a protein involved in regulating the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles. Importantly, we found cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulated the late recruitment of synapsin transport packets to synapses, thus identifying kinases as a key signaling molecule in the formation of synaptic contacts. Together, this work provides new insight into the mechanisms that underlie synaptogenesis. This dissertation includes both previously published and unpublished co-authored material...|$|R
