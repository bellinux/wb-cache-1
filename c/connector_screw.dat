40|$|This paper reports using theoretical-experimental {{analysis}} for obtaining and characterising the design parameters governing steel and concrete slab composite beams’ behaviour using shear <b>connector</b> <b>screws.</b> Currently no {{research has been}} found about such behaviour and Colombian seismic-resistant regulations (NSR- 98) have not yet defined such design; these types of connectors are most used in constructing composite sections in Colombia. The results of 36 experimental scale tests for 21 MPa and 28 MPa con-crete strengths were taken for the analysis; each concrete strength had three screw diameters (Ø 1 / 2 ", Ø 5 / 8 " and Ø 3 / 4 ") with 0. 10 m and 0. 30 m separations. This research also studied other effects such as slip caused by steel and connector profile defor-mation or deformation due to concrete degradation. Formulations were thus used which included connector slip and separation. The article sets out a methodology for designing composite beams using shear <b>connector</b> <b>screws.</b> It also proposes a formulation for calculating connector shear strength, thereby obtaining almost 62 % stud connector resistance when separation was 0. 10 m and an extra 13 % for 0. 30 m separations in elastic parameters where 62 % of theoretical effective inertia was obtained and 23 % more composite beam average bending strength was found than that required by current regulations...|$|R
50|$|The {{connector}} {{contains two}} parallel rows of contacts within a shielded case having a characteristic D-shape {{similar to that}} used in D-subminiature connectors. The contacts are not pins, but small flat bands of metal, called ribbon contacts. The connectors are manufactured in many capacities, including 14-, 24-, 36-, 50-, 64-, and 100- pin varieties. They may be mounted on boards, panels, or may terminate cables. Wires are attached by means of solder, crimping or insulation displacement.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to adopt the Johansen’s {{yielding}} theory as a possibility to predict the ultimate load for timber-to-concrete joints using self-tapping threaded <b>connectors</b> <b>screwed</b> at an angle into the wood. The ultimate loadbearing capacity of a single connector is predicted to be when either the stresses in the wood reach the plastic failure stress level or when a combination of plastic failure in wood and dowel is attained. K. W. Johansen assumed that no axial tension occurred in the dowel and, thus no frictional contribution affected the lateral load-bearing capacity. However, the joints with inclined fasteners are first affected by tension load, so the withdrawal capacity of the screws has to be taken into account. In order to determine the load bearing capacity for specific connector geometry, the kinematical possible failure modes are determined. The screw in the concrete part of connection was taken as rigidly embedded and thus no deformations appeared. The study showed that the load-bearing capacity for connections with inclined high tensile strength screws can be predicted using the yielding theory, but this theory was unable to predict precisely the failure mode. Possible reasons for that include limited fastener ductility and influence of the screw inclination on the strength properties of timber...|$|R

40|$|In {{electrical}} engineering terminal connectors {{are commonly used}} for connecting and releasing electrical conductors. They are sophisticated mass products sufficient for high- and low power transmission or transmitting information. There are various applications for wiring in cars, control- or house installations and electrical power supply systems. Depending on the electrical current to be transmitted and consequently the wire diameter there are several approaches to realize a durable and safe mechanical connection between the conductors. The electrical contact resistance of such systems {{is defined by the}} constriction- and the film resistance. The constriction resistance heavily depends on the contact or load force. If the connection becomes loose, this force decreases or even disappears, which results in an extensive raise of the temperature in the contact area. The current density is locally increasing on certain connection points. The raised temperature may lead to unwanted operational states or even fire. There are a few mechanical solutions to realize a constant or re-adjusting contact force. However, these approaches are mechanically complex and hence cost intensive. In this paper we present the development and experimental investigation of a self-adjusting terminal connector based on shape-memory alloys (SMA) which is far less complex than currently known mechanical solutions. The compensation of the decreasing contact force is realized by a precompressed SMA cylinder, which is located in a drill hole {{at the bottom of the}} terminal <b>connector’s</b> <b>screw.</b> Under normal conditions the terminal works similar to a conventional <b>screw</b> <b>connector.</b> In case of decreasing contact forces, the increasing contact resistance results in a rising temperature. As soon as the austenite start temperature is reached the SMA cylinder starts to expand and resets the contact force. As a result the system cools down and the SMA cylinder keeps a desired contact force. In this paper we present the general design of such a system and ist limitations. Measurement data of the SMA cylinder and the active terminal connector will further show the proof of the concept...|$|R

40|$|<b>Screw</b> shear <b>connectors</b> {{have been}} most {{commonly}} used in Colombia for many years; however, there is no current design methodology justifying its use in composite sections and prevailing rules insist that elements used as shear connectors must be tested.
