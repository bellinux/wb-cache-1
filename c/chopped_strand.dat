50|$|FRP (GRP): Glass mats in {{the form}} of <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> mat and woven roving is most common in hand lay-up method.

50|$|Fibers used in {{advanced}} composite manufacture come in various forms, including tows, yarns, rovings, <b>chopped</b> <b>strands,</b> and woven fabric mats. Each of these {{has its own}} special application. When prepreg materials are used in parts manufacture, woven fabric or mats are required.

40|$|The present paper {{introduces}} a probabilistic approach to simulating the crack bridging effects of <b>chopped</b> glass <b>strands</b> in cement-based matrices and compares it to a discrete rigid body spring network model with semi-discrete {{representation of the}} <b>chopped</b> <b>strands.</b> The glass strands exhibit random features at various scales, which {{are taken into account}} by both models. Fiber strength and interface stress are considered as random variables at the scale of a single fiber bundle while the orientation and position of individual bundles with respect to a crack plane are considered as random variables at the crack bridge scale. At the scale of the whole composite domain, the distribution of fibers and the resulting number of crack-bridging fibers is considered. All the above random effects contribute to the variability of the crack bridge performance and result in size-dependent behavior of a multiply cracked composite...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} compressive {{properties of}} syntactic foam {{with and without}} the inclusion of E-glass fibers {{in the form of}} <b>chopped</b> <b>strands</b> are reported. The effort pointed {{to the fact that the}} fiber-free syntactic foam had a higher compressive strength than the fiber-bearing one whereas as regards the moduli values they did not differ much. The difference in strength is correlated with the amount of voids present in two foams. The scope of the work was further expanded by including scanning electron microscopy for examining: the surface features of samples prior to and after compression test...|$|R
50|$|These rovings {{are then}} either used {{directly}} in a composite application such as pultrusion, filament winding (pipe), gun roving (where an automated gun chops the glass into short lengths and drops {{it into a}} jet of resin, projected {{onto the surface of}} a mold), or in an intermediary step, to manufacture fabrics such as <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> mat (CSM) (made of randomly oriented small cut lengths of fiber all bonded together), woven fabrics, knit fabrics or uni-directional fabrics.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{by laying}} {{multiple}} layers of fiber {{on top of one}} another, with each layer oriented in various preferred directions, the material's overall stiffness and strength can be efficiently controlled. In fiberglass, it is the plastic matrix which permanently constrains the structural glass fibers to directions chosen by the designer. With <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> mat, this directionality is essentially an entire two dimensional plane; with woven fabrics or unidirectional layers, directionality of stiffness and strength can be more precisely controlled within the plane.|$|E
5000|$|Fiberglass (or fibreglass; [...] "Fiberglas" [...] is a trademarked brand name) {{is a type}} of fiber-reinforced plastic {{where the}} {{reinforcement}} fiber is specifically glass fiber. The glass fiber may be randomly arranged, flattened into a sheet (called a <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> mat), or woven into a fabric. The plastic matrix may be a thermoset polymer matrix - most often based on thermosetting polymers such as epoxy, polyester resin, or vinylester - or a thermoplastic.

It was found that the compressive strength values generally increased with fiber content except for the 3. 54 % fiber-bearing cast slab, which recorded lower values. This lone exception was due to the difference in processing route adopted in fabricating this particular fiber-bearing foam. Also noticed {{was the fact that the}} compressive strength of the 0. 9 vol % fiber-bearing system was lower compared to the fiber-free system. This was correlated to the higher level of void content noticed with this fiber-bearing foam compared to that seen in the unreinforced foam...|$|R
5000|$|Compression molding is a high-volume, {{high-pressure}} method {{suitable for}} molding complex, high-strength fiberglass reinforcements.

50|$|Storage tanks {{can be made}} of {{fiberglass}} with capacities up {{to about}} 300 tonnes.

Much more reliable tanks are made using woven mat or filament wound fiber, with the fiber orientation at right angles to the hoop stress imposed in the side wall by the contents. Such tanks tend to be used for chemical storage because the plastic liner (often polypropylene) is resistant {{to a wide range of}} corrosive chemicals. Fiberglass is also used for septic tanks.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} is extremely heavy, which appeals to many prospective cruisers. The hull {{is made of}} hand-laid fibreglass, in 12 layers, alternating woven roving with <b>chopped</b> <b>strand</b> mat, set in polyester resin. This results in a solid hull whose thickness ranges from half an inch at minimum to almost an inch. This is considerably more than most equivalent boats. The deck is half-inch plywood sheathed in GRP; the bulkheads are also plywood, tabbed to the hull with fibreglass cloth. The ballast is 7000 lb, either lead and iron (earlier boats) or all lead, installed inside the keel (which {{is part of the}} hull shape) and set in resin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chopped</b> {{fiberglass}} <b>strands</b> {{embedded in}} the foam add to the structural integrity through physical support and shrapnel mitigation. The layer that strengthens the foam in turn strengthens the airframe. The layer of fiberglass also prevents shrapnel and bullets from rupturing the foam. The fiber glass then allows {{the damage caused by}} projectile penetration to heal more effectively.|$|R
40|$|Absorption due to {{immersion}} in aqueous media consisting of either saline or seawater or due to {{exposure to water}} vapor conditions and the attendant effect on the compressive properties of syntactic foam reinforced with E-glass fibers {{in the form of}} <b>chopped</b> <b>strands</b> were studied. Whereas the compressive strength decreased in samples exposed to water vapor, the saline or seawater immersed samples showed increase when compared to the dry sample. The decrease in strength in the vapor-exposed case is ascribed to higher absorption of water and to debonding and damaged features for interfaces. The enhancement of strength values for the samples immersed in saltish media is traced to the larger size of the chloride ion and resultant changes in the stress state around the fiber-bearing regions. Recourse to an analysis of scanning electron microscopic pictures of the compression-failed samples is taken to explain the observed trends...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDirect-fiber-feeding {{injection}} molding (DFFIM), with {{the improvement of}} the screw and cylinder and a fiber-direct-feeding method, is a new way to make short fiber reinforced composite material from one step by throwing fiber into a formation machine directly, in which the traditional compounding process can be unnecessary.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the manufacturing process of thermo-set fibreglass nonwoven composites. Techniques of manufacturing nonwoven webs from <b>chopped</b> <b>strands</b> were investigated and from the literature review {{it was found that}} the wet laid method was appropriate. The process of manufacturing paper hand sheets from pulp was modified to manufacture flat fibreglass nonwoven webs. The effects of dispersion and fibre length on the quality of these webs were investigated. It was found that the quality of these webs improved due to the dispersion. These nonwoven webs were then impregnated with epoxy resin by using the resin infusion method of vacuum bagging to make composite samples. The effects of dispersion, fibre length and multiple layering on the quality and mechanical properties of these composites were studied. It was found that it is necessary to disperse the fibreglass strands in order to manufacture composites of better quality. The quality and strength of these composites also improved due to the increase in the fibre length and multiple layering. Some initial studies were done to manufacture 3 D fibreglass nonwoven webs by using the vacuum forming technique and 3 D fibreglass nonwoven composites were also made using these webs.

The direction taken by the market has been increasingly drawn to eco-sustainable systems and in this way, the interest in the use of laminated composite panels for cladding, basalt fibres based. Basalt is a natural rock, silica based, which is produced through a variety of industrial processes into filaments, wool, <b>chopped</b> <b>strands</b> and fabrics. It is characterized by high resistance in chemically aggressive environments, high fire resistance, high mechanical resistance to compression and bending. The study focuses on two types of composite laminates produced by means of the technique of vacuum bagging, using layers of unidirectional and random basalt fabrics, with different areal weights, using an epoxy resin as matrix. The laminate samples were subjected to cycles of artificial aging in climatic chamber and outdoor exposure for a year and the parameters considered most significant: flexural modulus, tensile strength and mass, were investigated. The experimental investigations were conducted according to the methodology for the evaluation of the durability of the ISO 15686.
