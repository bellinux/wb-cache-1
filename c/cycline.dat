E. lausannensis is able to infect {{a wide range of}} amoebal, fish and mammalian cell lines. Moreover, seroprevalence of 2. 9 % was reported in children and in women with tubal pathology, showing that humans are commonly exposed to this recently discovered strict intracellular bacteria considered as a potential pathogen. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using two approaches: qPCR and cellular mortality assay. Antibiotics classically used against intracellular bacteria were tested, including β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, <b>cyclines</b> and macrolides. We showed that E. lausannensis is resistant to β-lactams and fluoroquinolones, and sensitive to <b>cyclines.</b> Interestingly, E. lausannensis is slightly resistant to azithromycin with a MIC of 2 μg/ml, which is 10 fold higher compared to Waddlia chondrophila and Parachlamydia acanthamoebae MIC's.

The results will help to extend the range of conventional dense-medium <b>cyclining</b> to sizes now typically cleaned in relatively inefficient water-only cyclone and spiral concentrators circuits. This technology also provides a potential approach to produce ultra-clean material as {{would be used for}} feedstocks for premium carbon products. This report describes Phase I of the project, which involved laboratory testing of dense-medium <b>cyclining</b> and subsequent medium recovery, with and without ultrasonic treatment, along with fundamental dispersion testing. Dense-medium cycloning was conducted with a 76. 2 -mm (3 -in.) diameter cyclone under various conditions including magnetite grade, medium relative density, inlet pressure, cyclone geometry, and feed coal. Dense-medium recovery testing was carried out with a 305 -mm (12 -in.) diameter x 152 -mm (6 -in.) wide wet-drum magnetic separator using the cyclone clean coal and refuse products as the feed material. Fundamental testing of dispersion/reagglomeration phenomena was conducted with coal/clay mixtures. In almost all cases, the dense-medium cyclone was capable of achieving separations down to approximately 0. 037 mm. Ultrasonic treatment had a slight effect on reducing the ash content of the clean coal. It was also found that ultrasonic treatment improved the purity of the magnetic fraction during wet-drum magnetic separation. The treatment was particularly beneficial for the cyclone overflow material.

40|$|Gene {{clusters}} amplified in the {{ovarian follicle}} cells of Drosophila serve as powerful models for metazoan DNA replication. In response to developmental signals, specific genomic regions undergo amplification by repeated firing of replication origins and bidirectional movement of replication forks for ≈ 50 kb in each direction. Previous work focused on initiation of amplification, defining replication origins, establishing {{the role of}} the prereplication complex and origin recognition complex (ORC), and uncovering regulatory functions for the Myb, E 2 F 1, and Rb transcription factors. Here, we exploit follicle cell amplification to investigate the control of DNA replication fork progression and termination, poorly understood processes in metazoans. We identified a mutant in which, during gene amplification, the replication forks move twice as far from the origin compared with wild type. This phenotype is the result of an amino acid substitution mutation in the <b>cyclinE</b> gene, <b>cyclinE</b> 1 f 36. The rate of oogenesis is normal in <b>cyclinE</b> 1 f 36 /cyclinEPz 8 mutant ovaries, indicating that increased replication fork progression is due to increased replication fork speed, possibly from increased processivity. The increased amplification domains observed in the mutant imply that there are not replication fork barriers preventing replication forks from progressing beyond the normal 100 -kb amplified region.

RESULTS The inhibition of expression of <b>cyclinE</b> 1 in ACHN cells mediated by recombinant vector (0. 0933 ± 0. 05) was significantly lower than that {{in the group of}} transfected with empty vector (0. 8827 ± 0. 04) and the control group (0. 9021 ± 0. 03) (P < 0. 05). Flow cytometry showed that recombinant cells were blocked in the G 1 phase and the apoptotic ratio was increased significantly (11. 15 ± 4. 00) % (P < 0. 05). The curves of cell growth indicated that the proliferation of cell transfected with recombinant plasmid was inhibited significantly compared with that in control group (P < 0. 05).

40|$|In {{mitotic cell}} cycles, the genome must be {{replicated}} fully in each cell cycle {{to ensure the}} normal complement of chromosomes. Failure to replicate chromosomes fully or a failure to limit replication to once-per-cell-cycle may lead to aneuploidy and genomic instability. Variants of the archetypal mitotic cell cycle, utilizing conserved cell cycle machinery, are employed during metazoan development to achieve different aims. Endocycles, in which the cell cycle proceeds without complete mitosis, generate polyploidy and are commonly employed to increase metabolic capacity and cell size. D. melanogaster follicle cell gene amplification, in which bi-directional replication occurs {{in the absence of}} detectable gap phases, serves to produce large amounts of eggshell proteins and may also serve to regulate transcription. During D. melanogaster embryogenesis, mitotic cell cycles, endocycles and cell cycle exit occur concurrently. We undertook a screen to identify factors affecting developmentally regulated, variant cell cycles during D. melanogaster embryogenesis. We identified a class of mutants with apparently polyploid cells in normally diploid tissues indicating a failure to maintain mitotic cycles. (cont.) In this class of mutants, we identified and characterized new mutants in pavarotti and tumbleweed, pav 3 C 53 and tum 32 a- 20.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{steady-state}} behaviour of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) {{can provide}} crucial evidence for detecting disease-causing genes. However, monitoring {{the dynamics of}} GRNs is particularly difficult because biological data only reflects {{a snapshot of the}} dynamical behaviour of the living organism. Also most GRN data and methods are used to provide limited structural inferences. Results In this study, the theory of stochastic GRNs, derived from G-Networks, is applied to GRNs in order to monitor their steady-state behaviours. This approach is applied to a simulation dataset which is generated by using the stochastic gene expression model, and observe that the G-Network properly detects the abnormally expressed genes in the simulation study. In the analysis of real data concerning the cell cycle microarray of budding yeast, our approach finds that the steady-state probability of CLB 2 is lower than that of other agents, while most of the genes have similar steady-state probabilities. These results lead {{to the conclusion that the}} key regulatory genes of the cell cycle can be expressed in the absence of CLB type <b>cyclines,</b> which was also the conclusion of the original microarray experiment study. Conclusion G-networks provide an efficient way to monitor steady-state of GRNs. Our method produces more reliable results then the conventional t -test in detecting differentially expressed genes. Also G-networks are successfully applied to the yeast GRNs. This study will be the base of further GRN dynamics studies cooperated with conventional GRN inference algorithms. </p...|$|R

DESIGN: Prospective, noncomparative, interventional case series. METHODS: patients: Children with phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis associated with severe steroid-dependent corneal inflammation and not responding to oral antibiotics (<b>cyclines</b> or erythromycin). intervention: Topical CsA 2 % four times daily, initially combined with topical dexamethasone for the first week. main outcome measures: Efficacy was judged by the patients (symptoms and ocular redness) and by the ophthalmologist (ocular redness and corneal inflammation). The patients were monitored for adverse effects, and cyclosporinemia was determined every 3 months. RESULTS: We studied 11 children (13 eyes) {{with a mean age}} of 9 years (range, 4 to 15 years). Inflammation was controlled in all the eyes within 14 days. Inflammation did not recur during CsA monotherapy, during a mean follow-up of 12 +/- 8 months (range, 6 to 31 months). CsA therapy was stopped in eight patients (10 eyes) after a mean treatment duration of 13 +/- 9 months (range, 6 to 31 months), and no recurrences occurred during 10 +/- 3 months of follow-up (range, 6 to 12 months). Local tolerance of CsA was good. None of the patients had detectable CsA blood levels. CsA was withdrawn in one case after 6 months, because of generalized skin rash.

Advanced studies oil nuclear translocation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family have greatly improved our knowledge of the biological function of cell surface receptors. In this study, we used the Tet-on LMP 1 HNE 2 cell line as a cell model, which is a dual-stable LMP 1 -integrated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell line and the expression of LMP 1 which could be regulated by the Tet system. We found that LMP 1 could regulate the nuclear accumulation of EGFR in a dose-dependent manner quantitatively and qualitatively. We also demonstrated that the nuclear localization sequence of EGFR played some roles in the location of the protein within the nucleus under LMP 1 regulation and EGFR ill the nucleus Could bind to the promoters of cyclinD 1 and <b>cyclinE,</b> respectively. We further demonstrated that EGFR is involved in the acceleration of the G 1 /S phase transition by LMP 1 through binding to cyclinD 1 and <b>cyclinE</b> directly.

This study shows {{for the first}} time that low doses of PTX (5 nM) potently induce apoptosis in human retinoblastoma Y 79 cells. The effect of PTX is accompanied by a potent induction of E 2 F 1 which appears to play a critical role in the effects induced by PTX. PTX induced a dose- and time-dependent effect, with G 2 /M arrest, <b>cyclines</b> A, E and B 1 accumulation and a marked modification in the status of Cdc 2 -cyclin B 1 complex, the major player of the G 2 /M checkpoint. Apoptosis followed G 2 /M arrest. An early and prolonged increase in p 53 expression with its stabilization by phosphorylation and acetylation and its nuclear translocation occurred. Consistently, PTX increased p 21 WAF 1, bax and MDM 2 levels, suggesting that p 53 is transcriptionally active. p 53 accumulated following both E 2 F 1 up-regulation and increase in the levels of p 14 ARF which interacts with MDM 2 preventing ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of p 53. Both extrinsic (E 2 F 1 /Fas/JNK/caspase- 2 activation) and intrinsic (Bcl- 2 phosphorylation, Bid fragmentation and Bax increase) pathways seemed to be involved. Loss of mitochondrial potential and activation of apoptosome and executive caspase- 3,- 6 and- 7 was shown. Incubation with either the irreversible pan-caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-FMK, or SP 600125, a selective inhibitor of JNK, or pifithrin alpha, a potent p 53 inhibitor, significantly inhibited the effects induced by PTX...|$|R
40|$|Residents {{of western}} {{countries}} travel {{more and more}} to (sub) tropical areas for holidays or work. During their stay they come in contact with insects and parasites susceptible to induce skin disorders that can manifest during their stay or after returning. This dermatosis account for approximately 10 % of referral to outpatient tropical clinics. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide family physicians not familiar with these pathologies some practical guidelines to help them to identify and treat some tropical dermatosis: cutaneous larva migrans, cutaneous leishmaniasis, Lyme disease, rickettsiosis. Cutaneous larva migrans is the most frequent serpiginous itching eruption observed in travellers. It is cause by transepidermal penetration of animal hookworms (ancylostomas) through contact with soil infested with cat and dog feces. Effective treatments include topical thiabendazole or oral albendazole or ivermectine. Persons visiting mediterranean countries can acquire cutaneous leishmanisis that has many clinical presentations; the most typical is 'bouton d'Orient', which manifests as painless ulceration resistant to antibiotic treatment. Treatment with intralesionel pentavalent antimony or pentamidine injection are effective. Lyme disease is an endemic infection in certain areas of North America and Europe, caused by the spirochete borrelia and transmitted through tick bite. It manifest as non-itching large persistent migrant erythema. If untreated this infection may expose to chronic debilitating rheumatologic, cardiac and neurological complications. Rickettsiosis, especially boutonneuse fever, area a potentially fatal multisystemic infectious disease transmitted through the bite of a dog tick. Diagnosis must be evoked in the presence of a brutal fever syndrome, a painless eschar and widespread eruption associate to systemic symptoms. This infection must be recognized clinically in order to begin rapidly treatment with <b>cyclines.</b> SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac Ischemic injury, ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of <b>cyclines</b> and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|R
40|$|Background: No {{effective}} {{therapy is}} available for hepatocellular carcinoma. To identify novel therapeutic strategies, we explored {{the effects of the}} depletion of E 2 F 1, cyclin E 1 –E 2 whose inter-relationships in hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation have never been defined. Methods: siRNA-mediated depletion of the targets was studied in the hepatocellular carcinoma cells HepG 2, HuH 7 and JHH 6 characterized by high, medium and low hepatocyte differentiation grade, respectively; a model of normal human hepatocytes was also considered. Results: The depletion of each target mRNA reduced the levels of the other two mRNAs, thus demonstrating a close regulatory control, also confirmed by over-expression experiments. At the protein level, an exception to this trend was observed for <b>cyclinE</b> 1 whose amount increased upon cyclin E 2 (HepG 2, HuH 7, JHH 6) and E 2 F 1 (HepG 2) depletion. In HepG 2, reduced <b>cyclinE</b> 1 proteolysis accounted for this observation. Additionally, cyclin E 1 –E 2 –E 2 F 1 targeting decreased the levels of cyclin A 2 mRNA and of the hyper-phosphorylated form of pRb thus leading to an S-phase cell decrease; migration was impaired as well. Finally, the model of human hepatocytes used was clearly less affected by target mRNAs depletion than hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Conclusion: Our data provide novel mutual relationships amongst cyclin E 1 –E 2 –E 2 F 1 and indicate their role in sustaining hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation/migration, validating the concept of an anti-cyclin E 1 –E 2 –E 2 F 1 therapeutic approach for hepatocellular carcinoma...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTo {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} méticillino-résistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among health care personnel in Abidjan teaching hospitals {{as well as their}} resistance profile against other antibiotics, 592 health care personnel from various surgical and medical services: the intensive care unit, gynaecology and obstetrics and third-degree burns services of the Cocody, Treichville and Yopougon Teaching Hospitals were included. The previous nasal pits of each subject included were swabbed. The isolation of S. aureus strains was run in a Chapman medium followed by Identification based on morphological and biochemical characteristics. The resistance profile of the strains to antibiotics was determined by standard Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and a 1 microg disc of oxacillin was used for the detection of meticillin-resistance S. aureus strains according to NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) guidelines. 269 members of the studied personnel were carriers of S. aureus, either a rate of portage of 45. 4 %. Among the 269 S. aureus isolates, 38. 7 % were MRSA strains and the carriage rate of MRSA in the population was 17. 8 %. The health care personnel working in surgery was the more colonized (36. 7 %) follow-up of those of the medical services (31. 4 %) and of the the intensive care unit (12. 4 %). A variable proportion of strains of MRSA also expressed resistances to the other families of antibiotics: 27 % to aminosids of which 13. 5 % of phénotype kanamycine, tobramycine, gentamycine (KTG), 58. 7 % to macrolids and related (MLS), 37. 5 % to fluoroquinolons, 14. 4 % to <b>cyclines</b> and 40 % to the cotrimoxazole. This confirms their multi-resistant character. The prevalence of MRSA carriage among health care personnel is high; this personnel constitutes an infectious risk for the hospitalized patients who are so exposed to nosocomial infections caused by MRSA...|$|R
40|$|Many {{clinically}} available {{drugs are}} used {{without a clear}} understanding of how they work. This is particularly true in oncology, where powerful cytotoxic drugs are given to patients despite {{the fact that we do}} not fully understand their mechanism of action. Even targeted therapies such as rapamycins and recep tor tyrosine kinase inhibitors are active in only a subset of the tumours for which they were origin ally developed, which has led to calls for better methods to identify tumours that will respond to specific drugs. This issue is even more pressing for conventional cytotoxic agents because, in add ition to being toxic to cancer cells, they can also be toxic to healthy cells. Now, writing in eLife, Brey Denard, Ching Lee and Jin Ye provide evi dence that doxorubicin, a widely used cancer drug, induces cellular toxicity via a novel mech anism that involves the synthesis of ceramide fol lowed by activation of a transcription factor called CREB 3 L 1 (Denard et al., 2012). This is a story that began 40 years ago with the introduction of doxorubicin and daunorubicin into clinical practice. Both of these compounds belong to a class of drugs called anthracyclines that are derived from bacteria belonging to the genus Streptomyces. Extensive clinical studies have demonstrated that they are active against a wide variety of tumours (Minotti et al., 2004). However, despite this, the clinical use of anthra <b>cyclines</b> has been limited because of a signifi cant risk for cardiac damage. The chances of this lifethreatening side effect depend on cumula tive dosage, and can occur decades after expos ure (Kremer et al., 2001). Over the years, many mechanisms of action have been proposed for these drugs—including topoisomerase II inhibition, DNA intercalation, and free radical generation— but there has until recently been a lack of defini tive evidence for all three of these mechanism...|$|R
