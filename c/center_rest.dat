500|$|Coprinellus micaceus is {{a common}} species of fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae with a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. The fruit bodies of the saprobe typically grow in clusters on or near rotting hardwood tree stumps or underground tree roots. Depending on their stage of development, the tawny-brown mushroom caps may range in shape from oval to bell-shaped to convex, and reach diameters up to [...] The caps, marked with fine radial grooves that extend nearly to the <b>center,</b> <b>rest</b> atop whitish stems up to [...] long. In young specimens, the entire cap surface is coated with a fine layer of reflective mica-like cells that provide the inspiration for both the mushroom's species name and the common names mica cap, shiny cap, and glistening inky cap. Although small and with thin flesh, the mushrooms are usually bountiful, as they typically grow in dense clusters. A few hours after collection, the gills will begin to slowly dissolve into a black, inky, spore-laden liquid—an enzymatic process called autodigestion or deliquescence. The fruit bodies are edible before the gills blacken and dissolve, and cooking will stop the autodigestion process.|$|E

5000|$|Long {{workpieces}} {{often need}} to be supported in the middle, as cutting tools can push (bend) the work piece away from where the centers can support them, because cutting metal produces tremendous forces that tend to vibrate or even bend the workpiece. This extra support can be provided by a steady rest (also called a steady, a fixed steady, a <b>center</b> <b>rest,</b> or sometimes, confusingly, a center). It stands stationary from a rigid mounting on the bed, and it supports the workpiece at the rest's center, typically with three contact points 120° apart. A follower rest (also called a follower or a travelling steady) is similar, but it is mounted to the carriage rather than the bed, which means that as the tool bit moves, the follower rest [...] "follows along" [...] (because they are both rigidly connected to the same moving carriage).|$|E

The influences of spindle rotating rate, lubricating oil dynamic viscosity and inlet flow rate on the lubricating oil film dynamic pressure effect of the heavy constant flow hydrostatic <b>center</b> <b>rest</b> were analyzed based on the computational fluid dynamics and lubrication theory, and the influencing laws were revealed. By means of this method, the reasonable data can be provided for reasonably controlling dynamic pressure and structure optimal design of the heavy constant flow hydrostatic <b>center</b> <b>rest...</b>|$|E
