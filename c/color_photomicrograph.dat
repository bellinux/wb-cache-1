40|$|ALTHOUGH {{studies on}} the develop [...] *^- ment of the red and white blood cells of the chick embryo date {{as far back as}} 1886 (Boccardi) and 1895 (Engel), there are still gaps in our understanding. In part this is due to {{confusion}} about nomen-clature. Sometimes, in the absence of <b>color</b> <b>photomicrographs,</b> it is impossible to be certain whether a given term always refers to the same cell. This confusion has been largely eliminated by the U. S. Depart-ment of Agriculture Monograph # 25 by Lucas and Jamroz (1961) with its profu-sion of color plates. All who work in this field owe them a considerable debt. However, information is still lacking on certain aspects of the chick embryo red cells, particularly with reference to the measurements of volume and hemoglobin content of individual cells. The only {{studies on the}}se lines are those reported by O'Connor (1951, 1952), who used methodology quite different from ours. The data reported below represent an attempt to provide some of the missing information, in particular by using a venepuncture technique to eliminate the confusion caused by the trauma of dis-secting the embryo, and the considerable manipulation necessary to obtain speci-mens. This type of study {{does not appear to have}} been reported before...|$|R
40|$|Background/purpose: In a {{previous}} fractural study, high-gold crowns possessed {{the second highest}} fracture force. The objective {{of this study is}} to analyze the interface of porcelain fused to high-gold alloy using different observation devices. Materials and methods: High-gold crowns specimens with the morphology of a maxillary second premolar were compressed vertically in the center of the occlusal surface until fracture using a universal testing machine. The fractured surfaces were examined using scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) to determine the failure mode. The ceramicâmetal interface of the crown was examined with electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). In addition, sheet specimens with dimensions of 10 Ã 9 Ã 4 Â mm 3 were prepared to examine the surface morphology and composition of high-gold alloy after oxidation using X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). Results: The average fracture force was 1368 Â± 312 Â N. Photograph of fractured crown and SEM/EDX analyses reveal that the crown initially suffered from cohesive failure in the upper and middle regions, with the fracture occurring mostly within the ceramic. XPS results and both EPMA <b>color</b> <b>photomicrographs</b> of crown and sheet specimens show that indium was observed along the porcelainâmetal interface with a 1 - to 2 -Î¼m disrupted zone of oxide layer. Conclusion: In 2 O 3 and Au were found along the interface from the multitechnique analysis methods; the presence of this oxide at the boundary promotes ceramicâmetal adhesion. In 2 O 3 is suggested to be beneficial for the second highest fracture resistance in {{a previous}} fractural study of implant-supported crowns.

40|$|The {{skeletal}} muscle or meat {{is the most}} often eaten part of beef and may have some Sarcocystis cysts. Most portion of raw hamburger (about 70 %) is made of meat. A study was made on 80 raw hamburger samples collected from retail food stores in Garmsar; Iran, for detection of Sarcocystis cysts by histological method. A total of 400 haematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue samples prepared from these 80 hamburgers were examined {{for the presence of}} Sarcocystis. Sarcocystis cysts were detected in five of the 80 hamburger examined. Therefore, the prevalence rate of Sarcocystis cysts in meat of hamburger was 6. 25 %. The Sarcocystis cysts contained numerous merozoites. Merozoites stained blue color and they have been detected from muscle tissues which stained red <b>color.</b> Some <b>photomicrographs</b> showed more than one cyst at a microscopy field and they had various size. The sizes of cysts were 8. 4 to 39. 2 x 14 to 75. 6 μm...|$|R
40|$|The four {{trays of}} the M 0003 {{materials}} experiment on LDEF contained 1274 samples from 19 subexperiments. The complete sample complement represented {{a broad range}} of materials, including thin film optical coatings, paints, polymer sheets and tapes, adhesives, and composites, for use in various spacecraft applications including thermal control, structures, optics, and solar power. Since some subexperiments included duplicate samples exposed on the leading and trailing edge trays, for 9 week, 19 week, 40 week, and 68 month durations on both the leading and trailing edges, comparisons provided a valuable time history of degradation. During the deintegration of the subexperiments from the M 0003 trays, each sample was examined using bright field, dark field, and Normarski light microscopy techniques. Over 3, 000 <b>color</b> macrographs and <b>photomicrographs</b> were made of the condition of M 0003 trays and the individual samples. Records of the condition of the samples, photographic records, and all available references of publications on postflight analyses on each sample were collected in a database. The photographs provide a visual comparison of the response of materials common to various subexperiments in different LDEF environments. Aerospace Corporation is distributing the database records and photographs and written records on materials of interest from the database is given in this presentation...|$|R
40|$|The four trays (2 {{leading edge}} and 2 {{trailing}} edge) of the M 0003 materials experiment on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) contained 1274 samples from 20 subexperiments. The complete sample complement represented {{a broad range}} of materials, including thin film optical coatings, paints, polymer sheets and tapes, adhesives, and composites, for use in various spacecraft applications, including thermal control, structures, optics, and solar power. Most subexperiments contained sets of samples exposed on both the leading and trailing edge trays of LDEF. Each individual sample was examined by high resolution optical microscope during the deintegration of the subexperiments from the M 0003 trays. Observations of the post-flight condition of the samples made during this examination were recorded in a computer data base. The deintegration observation data base is available to requesters on floppy disk in 4 th Dimension for the Macintosh format. Over 3, 000 <b>color</b> macrographs and <b>photomicrographs</b> were shot to complement the observation records and to document the condition of the individual samples and of the M 0003 trays. The photographs provide a visual comparison of the response of materials in leading and trailing edge LDEF environments. The Aerospace Corporate Archives is distributing photographs of the samples and hard copies of the database records to the general public upon request. Information on obtaining copies of the data base disks and for ordering photographs and records of specific samples or materials are given...|$|R
