5|$|This protein {{belongs to}} the apolipoprotein A1/A4/E family and {{contains}} 2 coiled coil domains. Overall, APOA5 is predicted to have approximately 60% a-helical content. The mature APOA5 protein spans a length of 366 amino acid residues, of which 23 amino acids code for the signal peptide. The molecular mass of the precursor was <b>calculated</b> <b>to</b> be 41 kDa, while the mature APOA5 protein was <b>calculated</b> <b>to</b> be 39 kDa.|$|E
5|$|Black Arrow was a three-stage rocket, fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene) {{and high}} test peroxide, a concentrated form of hydrogen peroxide.

5|$|Copernicium is <b>calculated</b> <b>to</b> {{have several}} {{properties}} {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been <b>calculated</b> <b>to</b> possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted {{to be more difficult}} to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E

5|$|At 09:15, {{two more}} ships {{appeared}} on the scene– Mount Temple and Californian, which had finally learned of the disaster when her radio operator returned to duty– but by then {{there were no more}} survivors to be rescued. Carpathia had been bound for Fiume, Austria-Hungary (now Rijeka, Croatia), but as she had neither the stores nor the medical facilities to cater for the survivors, Rostron ordered that a course be <b>calculated</b> <b>to</b> return the ship to New York, where the survivors could be properly looked after. Carpathia departed the area, leaving the other ships to carry out a final, fruitless, two-hour search.|$|E
5|$|Capella A {{consists}} of two yellow evolved stars that have been <b>calculated</b> <b>to</b> orbit each other every 104 days with a separation of around 100 million km. The pair is a non-eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes {{in front of the}} other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.|$|E
5|$|Francium is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly {{resemble those of}} caesium. A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was <b>calculated</b> <b>to</b> be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also uncertain.|$|E

She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she {{displays}} a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E

Livermorium is <b>calculated</b> <b>to</b> have some similar properties to its lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), and be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them.|$|E

Nihonium is <b>calculated</b> <b>to</b> have some similar properties to its lighter homologues, boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium, and behave as a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them.

5|$|Nihonium is {{expected}} to be much denser than thallium, having a predicted density of about 16 to 18g/cm3, due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of its 7s and 7p1/2 orbitals. This is because calculations estimate it to have an atomic radius of about 170pm, {{the same as that of}} thallium, even though periodic trends would predict it to have an atomic radius larger than that of thallium due to it being one period further down in the periodic table. The melting and boiling points of nihonium are not definitely known, but have been <b>calculated</b> <b>to</b> be 430°C and 1100°C respectively, exceeding the values for gallium, indium, and thallium, following periodic trends.|$|E
