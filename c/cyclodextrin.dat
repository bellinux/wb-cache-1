40|$|The {{numerous}} hydroxyl groups {{available in}} <b>cyclodextrins</b> are active sites that can form {{different types of}} linkages. They can be crosslinked with one another, or they can be derivatized to produce monomers that can form linear or branched networks. Moreover, they can form inclusion complexes with polymers and different substrates, modifying their physicochemical properties. This review shows the different applications using polymers with <b>cyclodextrins,</b> either by forming inclusion complexes, ternary complexes, networks, or molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). On one hand, the use of <b>cyclodextrins</b> enhances the properties of each polymer, {{and on the other}} the use of polymers decreases the amount of <b>cyclodextrins</b> required in different formulations. Both <b>cyclodextrins</b> and polymers contribute synergistically in several applications such as pharmacological, nutritional, environmental, and other industrial fields. The use of polymers based on <b>cyclodextrins</b> is a low cost easy to use potential tool with great future prospects...|$|R

Medi-ports, similar to ports used to administer chemotherapy drugs, were surgically placed into the twins' chest walls and allow doctors to directly infuse HPbCD into their bloodstreams. Treatment with <b>cyclodextrin</b> {{has been shown to}} delay clinical disease onset, reduced intraneuronal storage and secondary markers of neurodegeneration, and significantly increased lifespan in both the Niemann–Pick type C mice and feline models. This is the second time in the United States that <b>cyclodextrin</b> alone has been administered in an attempt treat a fatal pediatric disease. In 1987, HPbCD was used in a medical case involving a boy suffering from severe hypervitaminosis A.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cyclodextrins,</b> as {{they are}} known today, were called [...] "cellulosine" [...] when first {{described}} by A. Villiers in 1891. Soon after, F. Schardinger identified the three naturally occurring <b>cyclodextrins</b> -α, -β, and -γ. These compounds were therefore referred to as [...] "Schardinger sugars". For 25 years, between 1911 and 1935, Pringsheim in Germany was the leading researcher in this area, demonstrating that <b>cyclodextrins</b> formed stable aqueous complexes with many other chemicals. By the mid-1970s, each of the natural <b>cyclodextrins</b> had been structurally and chemically characterized and many more complexes had been studied. Since the 1970s, extensive work has been conducted by Szejtli and others exploring encapsulation by <b>cyclodextrins</b> and their derivatives for industrial and pharmacologic applications. Among the processes used for complexation, the kneading process {{seems to be one}} of the best.|$|R
25|$|The {{cyclical}} dextrins {{are known}} as <b>cyclodextrins.</b> They are formed by enzymatic degradation of starch by certain bacteria, for example, Paenibacillus macerans (Bacillus macerans). <b>Cyclodextrins</b> have toroidal structures formed by 6-8 glucose residues.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to prepare and characterize inclusion complexes of clonazepam with β-cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and to study the effect of complexation on the dissolution rate of clonazepam, a water-insoluble lipid-lowering drug. The phase-solubility profiles with both <b>cyclodextrins</b> were classified as AP-type, indicating the formation of 2 : 1 stoichiometric inclusion complexes. Gibbs free energy (ΔG_tr^o) values were all negative, indicating the spontaneous nature of clonazepam solubilization, and they decreased with increase in the <b>cyclodextrins</b> concentration, demonstrating that the reaction conditions became more favorable as the concentration of <b>cyclodextrins</b> increased. Complexes of clonazepam were prepared with <b>cyclodextrins</b> by various methods such as kneading, coevaporation, and physical mixing. The complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry studies. These studies indicated that complex prepared kneading and coevaporation methods showed successful inclusion of the clonazepam molecule into the <b>cyclodextrins</b> cavity. The complexation resulted in a marked improvement in the solubility and wettability of clonazepam. Among all the samples, complex prepared with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin by kneading method showed highest improvement in in vitro dissolution rate of clonazepam. Mean dissolution time of clonazepam decreased significantly after preparation of complexes and physical mixture of clonazepam with <b>cyclodextrins.</b> Similarity factor indicated {{significant difference between the}} release profiles of clonazepam from complexes and physical mixture and from plain clonazepam. Tablets containing complexes prepared with <b>cyclodextrins</b> showed significant improvement in the release profile of clonazepam as compared to tablet containing clonazepam without <b>cyclodextrins...</b>|$|R

The three main groups of siRNA nanovectors are: lipid based, non-lipid organic-based, and inorganic.

25|$|Within {{the cell}} membrane, {{cholesterol}} also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. Cholesterol {{is essential for}} the structure and function of invaginated caveolae and clathrin-coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The role of cholesterol in endocytosis of these types can be investigated by using methyl beta <b>cyclodextrin</b> (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Recent studies show that cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules. In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue. For many neuron fibers, a myelin sheath, rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of Schwann cell membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses. Demyelination (loss of some of these Schwann cells) is believed {{to be part of the}} basis for multiple sclerosis.|$|E

This review covers the research and application of <b>cyclodextrins</b> and their derivatives in asymmetric and stereospecific syntheses, with their division into three main groups: (1) <b>cyclodextrins</b> promoting asymmetric and stereospecific catalysis in water; (2) cyclodextrins’ complexes with transition metals as asymmetric and stereospecific catalysts; and (3) cyclodextrins’ non-metallic derivatives as asymmetric and stereospecific catalysts.

2500|$|The rate of {{dissolution}} and solubility {{should not}} be confused as they are different concepts, kinetic and thermodynamic, respectively.

2500|$|Synthesis via the capping method relies {{strongly}} upon a thermodynamically driven template effect; that is, the [...] "thread" [...] is held {{within the}} [...] "macrocycle" [...] by non-covalent interactions, for example rotaxinations with <b>cyclodextrin</b> macrocycles involve {{exploitation of the}} hydrophobic effect. This dynamic complex or pseudorotaxane is then converted to the rotaxane by reacting {{the ends of the}} threaded guest with large groups, preventing disassociation.|$|E
40|$|The high {{effectiveness}} of cyclic oligosaccharides like <b>cyclodextrins</b> {{in the production}} of trans-resveratrol in Vitis vinifera cell cultures is enhanced in the presence of methyl jasmonate. In order to dissect the basis of the interactions among the elicitation responses triggered by these two compounds, a transcriptional analysis of grapevine cell cultures treated with <b>cyclodextrins</b> and methyl jasmonate separately or in combination was carried out. The results showed that the activation of genes encoding enzymes from phenylpropanoid and stilbene biosynthesis induced by <b>cyclodextrins</b> alone was partially enhanced in the presence of methyl jasmonate, which correlated with their effects on trans-resveratrol production. In addition, protein translation and cell cycle regulation were more highly repressed in cells treated with <b>cyclodextrins</b> than in those treated with methyl jasmonate, and this response was enhanced in the combined treatment. Ethylene signalling was activated by all treatments, while jasmonate signalling and salicylic acid conjugation were activated only in the presence of methyl jasmonate and <b>cyclodextrins,</b> respectively. Moreover, the combined treatment resulted in a crosstalk between the signalling cascades activated by <b>cyclodextrins</b> and methyl jasmonate, which, in turn, provoked the activation of additional regulatory pathways involving the up-regulation of MYB 15, NAC and WRKY transcription factors, protein kinases and calcium signal transducers. All these results suggest that both elicitors cause an activation of the secondary metabolism in detriment of basic cell processes like the primary metabolism or cell division.

They are deemed unique products since natural and semi-synthetic CDs can modulate the physical, chemical and biopharmaceutical properties of guest molecules, eventually ameliorating critical drug properties such as water solubility, dissolution rate, stability and bioavailability. In addition, <b>cyclodextrins</b> have been studied as functional excipients in controlled release system. The advances in chemical strategies for CDs derivatization along with the exciting results obtained with site selective colloidal drug carriers, namely liposomes and nanoparticles, has brought to development of targeted <b>cyclodextrins.</b> In latest years, <b>cyclodextrins</b> have been regarded not only as simple functional excipients but rather as multifunctional supramolecular carriers. Two requirements have to fulfil to obtain such targeted CDs: 1. conjugation of targeting moieties on the CD scaffold, without impairing their specific recognition of cellular targets: 2. adequate complexation of the guest molecule {{that have to be}} efficiently transported to the specific disease site. In this chapter, a critical overview {{of some of the most}} interesting approaches aimed at develop targeted <b>cyclodextrins</b> is presented. Particular emphasis will be dedicated to tumor targeting, a field where selective treatments are strongly required and expectations from targeted therapies are extremely high.
