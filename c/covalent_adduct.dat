40|$|Chemicals can {{interact}} with the genetic material giving rise {{to the formation of}} <b>covalent</b> <b>adducts.</b> These alterations can lead to adverse consequences, including cancer, reproductive impairment, development anomalies, or genetic diseases. In search for an assay allowing identification of hazardous compounds that might form <b>covalent</b> <b>adducts</b> with nucleic acids, electrochemistry (EC) /liquid chromatography (LC) /mass spectrometry (MS) is presented. EC/LC/MS is a purely instrumental approach. EC is used for oxidative activation, LC for the fractionation of the reaction mixture, and MS for the detection and characterization of the reaction products. To test the system capabilities, we investigated the formation of <b>covalent</b> <b>adducts</b> produced by guanosine and acetaminophen (APAP). Electrochemical activation of mixtures of guanosine and APAP gave rise to the formation of four isomers of (guanosine + APAP- 2 H). Mass voltammograms as well as dose–response-curves were used to obtain insights in the mechanism of adduct formation. These experiments revealed that a mechanism involving radical intermediates is favored. The initial step of adduct formation is the conversion of both APAP and guanosine into radicals via one-electron–one-proton reactions. Among different competing reaction pathways, the generated radical intermediates undergo intermolecular reactions to form <b>covalent</b> <b>adducts</b> between guanosine and APAP...|$|R

Psoralens can form two types of monoadducts and one diadduct (an interstrand crosslink) reacting with thymine. The crosslinking reaction by Psoralens targets TA sequences intercalating in DNA and linking one base of the DNA with the one below it. Psoralen adducts cause replication arrest and are used in the treatment of psoriasis and vitiligo.|$|R

50|$|Other than {{transcriptional}} interference, {{the mechanism}} of action of Trabectedin is complex and not completely understood. The compound is known to bind and alkylate DNA at the N2 position of guanine. It is known from in-vitro work that this binding occurs in the minor groove, spans approximately 3 to 5 bp and is most efficient with CGG sequences. Additional favorable binding sequences are TGG, AGC, or GGC. Once bound, this reversible <b>covalent</b> <b>adduct</b> bends DNA toward the major groove, interferes directly with activated transcription, poisons the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCR) complex, promotes degradation of RNA polymerase II, and generates DNA double-strand breaks.|$|E

It is thought that ethionamide undergoes intracellular modification and acts in a similar fashion to isoniazid. Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. Specifically isoniazid inhibits InhA, the enoyl reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by forming a <b>covalent</b> <b>adduct</b> with the NAD cofactor.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an effective post-PCR sterilization process and have applied the procedure to a diagnostic assay for HIV- 1. The method, {{which is based on}} isopsoralen photochemistry, satisfies both the inactivation and hybridization requirements of a practical sterilization process. The key feature of the technique is the use of isopsoralen compounds which form <b>covalent</b> photochemical <b>adducts</b> with DNA. These <b>covalent</b> <b>adducts</b> prevent subsequent extension of previously amplified sequences (amplicons) by Taq polymerase. Isopsoralens have minimal inhibitory effect on the PCR, are activated by long wavelength ultraviolet light, provide sufficient numbers of <b>covalent</b> <b>adducts</b> to impart effective sterilization, modify the amplified sequence such that it remains single-stranded, and have little effect on subsequent hybridization. The sterilization procedure can be applied to a closed system and is suitable for use with commonly used detection formats. The photochemical sterilization protocol we have devised is an effective and pragmatic method for eliminating the amplicon carryover problem associated with the PCR. While the work described here is limited to HIV- 1, proper use of the technique will relieve the concern associated with carryover {{for a wide variety of}} amplicons, especially in the clinical setting...|$|R

40|$|Acyl glucuronide {{metabolites}} of bilirubin {{and many}} drugs can react with serum albumin in vivo to form <b>covalent</b> <b>adducts.</b> Such adducts {{may be responsible}} for some toxic effects of carboxylic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. The mechanism of formation of the adducts and their chemical structures are unknown. In this paper we describe the use of tandem mass spectrometry to locate binding sites and elucidate the binding mechanism involved in the formation of <b>covalent</b> <b>adducts</b> from tolmetin glucuronide and albumin in vitro. Human serum albumin and excess tolmetin glucuronide were coincubated in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride to trap imine intermediates. The total protein product was reduced, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Six tolmetin-containing peptides (indicated by absorbance at 313 nm) were isolated by high-pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed by liquid secondary-ion mass spectrometry and collision-induced dissociation, using a four-sector tandem mass spectrometer. All six peptides contained tolmetin linked covalently via a glucuronic acid to protein lysine groups. Major attachment sites on the protein were Lys- 195, - 199, and - 525; minor sites were identified as Lys- 137, - 351, and - 541. Our results show unambiguously that the glucuronic acid moiety of acyl glucuronides can be retained within the structure when these reactive metabolites bind covalently to proteins, and they suggest that acyl migration followed by Schiff base (imine) formation is a credible mechanism for the generation of <b>covalent</b> <b>adducts</b> in vivo...|$|R
5000|$|Phosphoenolpyruvate mutase {{is thought}} to exhibit a dissociative mechanism. [...] A {{magnesium}} ion is involved as a cofactor. The phosphoryl/phosphate group also appears to interact ionically with Arg159 and His190, stabilizing the reactive intermediate. A phosphoenzyme intermediate is unlikely because the most feasible residues for the <b>covalent</b> <b>adduct</b> can be mutated with only partial loss of function. The reaction involves dissociation of phosphorus from oxygen 2 and then a nucleophilic attack by carbon 3 on phosphorus. Notably, the configuration is retained at phosphorus, i.e. carbon 3 of PPR adds to the same face of phosphorus from which oxygen 2 of PEP was removed; this would be unlikely for a non-enzyme-catalyzed dissociative mechanism, but since the reactive intermediate interacts strongly with the amino acids and magnesium ions of the active site, {{it is to be}} expected in the presence of enzyme catalysis.|$|E
50|$|The HaloTag is a hydrolase, {{which has}} a genetically {{modified}} active site, which specifically binds the reactive chloroalkane linker and has an increased rate of ligand binding. The reaction that forms the bond between the protein tag and chloroalkane linker is fast and essentially irreversible under physiological conditions due to the terminal chlorine of the linker portion. In the aforementioned reaction, nucleophilic attack of the chloroalkane reactive linker causes displacement of the halogen with an amino acid residue, which results {{in the formation of}} a covalent alkyl-enzyme intermediate. This intermediate would then be hydrolyzed by an amino acid residue within the wild-type hydrolase. This would lead to regeneration of the enzyme following the reaction. However, in the modified haloalkane dehalogenase (HaloTag), the reaction intermediate cannot proceed through a subsequent reaction because it cannot be hydrolyzed due to the mutation in the enzyme. This causes the intermediate to persist as a stable <b>covalent</b> <b>adduct</b> with which there is no associated back reaction.|$|E
50|$|Under {{physiological}} conditions, ptaquiloside readily liberates glucose {{to produce}} the ptaquilodienone. The alkylation of amino acids with the dienone mostly {{takes place at the}} thiol group in cysteine, glutathione and methionine. The alkylation at the carboxylate group of each amino acid, forming the corresponding ester, is also observed to a small extent based on the previously reported literature. The dienone reacts with both adenine (majorly at N-3) and guanine (majorly at N-7) residues of DNA to form the DNA adducts. The alkylation induces spontaneous depurination and cleavage of DNA at adenine base site. In a model reaction with a deoxytetranucleotide (as shown on the right), a <b>covalent</b> <b>adduct</b> is found at a guanine residue and the N-glycosidic bond breaks to release the adduct. In 1998, Prakash, Smith and co-workers showed that the alkylation of adenine by ptaquiloside in codon 61 followed by depurination and error in the DNA synthesis resulted in the activation of H-ras proto-oncogene in the ileum of calves fed bracken.|$|E

Comparisons between mammalian ABCA4 to other ABCs, cellular localization of ABCA4, and analyses of ABCA4 knockout mice suggest that ABCA4 may function as an inward-directed retinoid flippase. Flippase is a transmembrane protein that [...] "flips" [...] its conformation to transport materials across a membrane. In the case of ABCA4, the flippase facilitates transfer of N-retinyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NR-PE), a <b>covalent</b> <b>adduct</b> of all-trans retinaldehyde (ATR) with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), trapped inside the disk as charged species out to the cytoplasmic surface. Once transported, ATR is reduced to vitamin A and then transferred to retinal pigment epithelium to be recycled into 11-cis-retinal. This alternating access-release model for ABCA4 has four steps: (1) binding of ATP to an NBD to bring two NBDs together and expose outer vestibule high affinity binding site located in TMD, (2) binding of NR-PE/ATR on extracellular side of the channel, (3) ATP hydrolysis promoting gate opening and movement of NR-PE/ATR across the membrane to the low-affinity binding site on the intracellular portion of TMD, and (4) release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) to release the bound ligand. The channel is then ready to transfer another molecule of NR-PE/ATR again.|$|E

40|$|During {{and after}} {{absorption}} in the intestine, quercetin is extensively metabolised by the phase II biotransformation system. Because the biological activity of flavonoids {{is dependent on}} the number and position of free hydroxyl groups, a first objective of this thesis was to investigate the consequences of phase II metabolism of quercetin for its biological activity. For this purpose, a set of analysis methods comprising HPLC-DAD, LC-MS and 1 H NMR proved to be a useful tool in the identification of the phase II metabolite pattern of quercetin in various biological systems. These studies showed that the 3 '- and 4 '-hydroxyl groups of quercetin, (catechol hydroxyl groups) were important targets for methylation, sulfation and glucuronidation. Methylation of a catechol hydroxyl group of quercetin proved to decrease the pH-dependent radical scavenging capacity of the compound, both by increasing its pK a for deprotonation and by decreasing its electron-donating properties. Methylation of a catechol hydroxyl group had a similar effect as replacement of the hydroxyl group by a hydrogen atom. Regarding the pro-oxidant properties of quercetin, methylation of a catechol hydroxyl group of quercetin did not eliminate the pro-oxidant chemistry of quercetin, reflected in the formation of <b>covalent</b> <b>adducts</b> with glutathione upon oxidation of quercetin by horseradish peroxidase. However, methylated quercetin proved to form only 42 % of the level of DNA adducts in exposed cells as compared to a similar amount of unconjugated quercetin, indicating that methylation of quercetin attenuates also this biological reactivity towards DNA. A second objective of this thesis was to obtain more insight into the possible toxic effects of quercetin by studying various mechanisms that might be relevant in the context of carcinogenesis. Quercetin appeared to have a biphasic effect on the proliferation of cancer cell lines expressing the estrogen receptor (ER). The stimulation of cancer cell proliferation was ER-dependent and appeared to occur at concentrations that are physiologically relevant in humans. With respect to the pro-oxidant activity of quercetin, peroxidase- and tyrosinase-type oxidative enzyme activity did not {{play a major role in}} the intracellular formation of <b>covalent</b> <b>adducts</b> of quercetin with DNA and protein, indicating that the formation of <b>covalent</b> <b>adducts</b> of quercetin with cellular macromolecules might also be relevant in cell types lacking oxidative enzyme activity.
