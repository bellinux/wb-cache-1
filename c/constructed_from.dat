40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} an integrated theoretical model of health behaviour based on <b>constructs</b> <b>from</b> the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and Self-determination Theory (SDT). Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Participants (N = 418) were students from five medical sciences universities located in northern Iran. Participants completed translated versions of Godin and Shephard’s Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (LTEQ) and another questionnaire which included a range of <b>constructs</b> <b>from</b> the TTM and SDT. Data were analyzed using bivariate correlation and structural equation modeling. Results: The relationships between exercise behaviour and all of the <b>constructs</b> <b>from</b> the TTM and SDT (except external regulation) were statistically significant. The modified model provided a good fit to the data and explained 82 % of the variance in current exercise behaviour. All of the structural pathways, with the exception of pros and cons, were significant and positive. Conclusions: Study findings support the application of an integrated model of health behaviour combining <b>constructs</b> <b>from</b> the TTM and SDT to explain the exercise behaviour of Iranian college students...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As model-driven {{development}} promotes metamodels as {{key assets}} {{it raises the}} issue of their reuse throughout a model-driven product line life cycle. One recurrent reuse need occurs when metamodeling integrated multi-language platforms: one <b>construct</b> <b>from</b> one language is integrated to <b>constructs</b> <b>from</b> other languages by generalizing it, making it more expressive. None of the metamodel assembly facilities provided by MOF and UML (import, merge and combine) or others proposed in previous work adequately addresses this need. We thus propose a new reuse and generalize facility for such purpose. ...|$|R
