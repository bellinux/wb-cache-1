50|$|One {{method of}} setting up a <b>counterpart</b> <b>fund</b> is to have {{businesses}} in the country receiving aid that want to import a commodity place an order with their government and pays for the import in their local currency.

The results clearly show that the CPHD filter has a more robust cardinality estimate leading to smaller OSPA errors, which confirms that the extended target CPHD filter inherits the properties of its point target <b>counterpart.</b> <b>Funding</b> Agencies|Swedish Research Council under the Linnaeus Center (CADICS) ||Swedish Research Council| 621 - 2010 - 4301 |Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research|| CADICSCUA...|$|R

Contrary to the usual approach a model is developed in this paper, which takes account of the budgetary impact, supply-side and money demand effects of <b>counterpart</b> <b>funds</b> and the underlying foreign aid. This model is used to show that <b>counterpart</b> <b>funds</b> need not have any economic impact if their creation, use, and effects are adequately monitored and understood, both by donors and by the authorities in the recipient country. The policy rules that ensure an inflation- and foreign reserves-neutral result from expected and unexpected foreign aid are derived and contrasted with a policy rule regarding unexpected foreign aid that is sometimes observed in IMF programs. A feasible alternative is developed. Various real world complications are shown not to alter the conclusions.
