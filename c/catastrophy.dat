He discovers that in this world line, he is a Rounder partnered with Moeka Kiryu, and that they have just completed a mission to kill Europol agents who have discovered their identities. He runs to the laboratory to shift to the previous world line with a D-mail, but is stopped by Kurisu and Suzuha: Kurisu witnessed Okabe killing the agents, and Suzuha has in this world line traveled back in time to stop Okabe from becoming a dictator, leader of the Rounders, {{and a member of the}} Committee of 300. Kurisu calls the police, but Moeka helps Okabe escape. They visit Mayuri, who is hospitalized, and Okabe learns that they were childhood friends but got separated after the Year 2000 problem occurred, which led to a <b>catastrophy</b> and the death of Mayuri and Okabe's families. Learning that Mayuri has cancer and is not expected to live for much longer, Okabe leaves to clear his head. Moeka questions Luka about Okabe's D-mail, and concludes that the Year 2000 problem likely was caused by SERN. Moeka assures Okabe that they do not have to worry about Kurisu's report, as the Rounders are pressuring the police. She says that they are like family in this world line, since Okabe saved her when she tried to commit suicide, and that she wants to help him even though he is different from the Okabe she knows. They receive their next mission – to take the time machine and its creators to SERN – but they decide to betray SERN, forcefully entering the laboratory prior to the scheduled mission; the other Rounders appear and shoot Okabe, but Moeka manages to send a D-mail that causes a world line shift, away from the gamma attractor field.|$|E

Measurements and photographs taken shortly afterwards showed that part of the glacier's snout (terminus) had been torn away, revealing a cavity 40 metres in diameter and 20 metres above its base. From this a 3 metre high tube led back some 85 metres and at a 36° angle to an even larger second cavity, up to 40m high and 50 m wide. Maps drawn up shortly afterwards confirmed a depression in the centre of the glacier. It was estimated that 100,000 cubic metres of liquid water had drained away during the glacier's collapse, plus a further 100,000 cubic metres of broken ice. Together with the soil and rock broken away by the force of the rushing water, Vallot estimated that a weight of 500 million kilograms of material had borne down on the villages. He also warned that a repeat of water build-up was quite likely to occur, and that this would become more dangerous as time went on. He advocated the use of explosives to ensure a permanent flow of meltwater away from the glacier.|$|E

We {{illustrate}} how {{a model of}} abstraction for the concept of agents, based upon a well-defined paradigm of what abstraction means {{in the context of}} artificial intelligence (AI), leads to a very practical application. The theoretical requirements for this application are to design and implement a decision support system in an environment of uncertain knowledge in a dynamically changing environment. Here uncertain means probabilistic. In practice, the resulting system is specialized to buy insurance covering risks in the area of natural <b>catastrophies.</b> Several tools are designed and implemented. Among them are the OntoBayes model which links Bayesian networks to influence diagrams and Virtual Knowledge Comunities (VKC) based upon onologies which enable the sharing and exchange of knowledge. The exchage of decision models is also a requirement in such a dynamical framework. This paper proposes an overview of the methodologies being designed...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{design of}} any artefact, either {{physical}} or abstract, {{is a complex}} cognitive activity that sometimes defies conventional wisdom {{and at other times}} requires skills that cannot be taught. Engineering design, an empiricist's paradise, is a knowledge based task in that it involves almost simultaneous access to a variety of knowledge sources, including analytical, formal, experimental and experiential, and involves a deft mixture of sophisticated computation, qualitative reasoning and extensive use of heuristics. This simultaneous access to the variety of knowledge sources becomes crucial in the design of networks that carry water, electricity, gas or oil. Barring major, and it should be said rare, <b>catastrophies</b> water and energy networks can be operated safely and efficiently.

[...] Boston UniversityThis thesis {{has been}} {{concerned}} with the treatment of evil by three outstanding personalists, Bowne, Knudson, and Brightman; {{all of whom have}} taught at Boston University during the past three-quarters of a century. Theistic, idealistic personalism was chosen as the philosophical position from which to consider the problem of evil for both religious and metaphysical reasons. Obviously, evil is primarily a religious problem, and must be squarely faced in any religious orientation to life. Besides its religious significance, evil, particularly natural evil, has important metaphysical repercussions for personalists {{in the light of the}} fact that, for them, the physical world is the direct result of God's energizing or creativity. Thus, God is directly responsible for these evils; and, consequently, the personalist is behooved to determine, if possible, the answer to this apparent paradox of God directly willing such evils as cancer, idiocy, and all the <b>catastrophies</b> of nature.

Pētījuma gaitā tiek secināts, ka tiek secināts, ka pirmā izvirzītā hipotēze - Japānas iedzīvotāju drošumspējas un cilvēkdrošība nemazinās pēc 2011. gada marta katastrofām – tiek apgāzta. Savukārt otrā hipotēze - Japānas ieguldījumi cilvēkdrošībā un citu valstu drošumspēju stiprināšanā atmaksājas gada laikā pēc 2011. gada marta katastrofām - tiek pierādīta. The {{theme of}} master thesis is „Role of human {{security}} in Japan – {{before and after}} <b>catastrophies</b> of March, 2011 ”. “Human security” is a security concept in international relations that was created by United Nations in mid- 90 ’s {{in order to create}} an ultimate tool for dealing with new challenges after the end of Cold War. It is human-centred and its main objectives are to create all necessary conditions for human “free of fear” and “free of want”. Since late- 90 ’s Japan has played a leading role on global stage by promoting and defending the human security concept and by investing in development assistance projects around the globe in order to fortify the securitability of other nations. Objective and subjective human security indicators are analysed in order to verify changes in Japan’s own human security after it was hit by a “triple catastrophe” (major earthquake, devastating tsunami and nuclear contamination) on March, 2011. Objective human security is analysed in 7 dimensions (political, economic, societal, food, health, environmental and personal security) by using 23 indicators and the overall level of human security has lowered by around 1 / 3 of maximum possible aggravation. Insecurity has increased especially in environmental, economic, food and political dimensions. Subjective human security is researched by using an online survey and its collected data from inhabitants of Japan. Results showed that Japanese people feel themselves less secure than before in 3 human security dimensions – environmental, economic and political. High intensity of threat perception was observed in several dimensions, especially in those mentioned above. As a fact, by comparing both objective and subjective human security results, it can be concluded that the level of human security in Japan has decreased one year after <b>catastrophies</b> of March, 2011. Furthermore, Japanese investments, inputs in human security before the disaster are compared with outputs and possible gains or losses in foreign policy during a period of one year after <b>catastrophies.</b> It can be concluded that, not only Japan has made major investments in human security by making generous financial contributions to United Nations Human Security Fund, but also it has helped to make Human Security Commission and has tailored its Official Development Assistance policy so that it can help to build securitability of many nations around the globe with its diverse projects. International community shows its gratitude for Japan’s leading role in human security promotion and it pays back to Japan when it faces one of the greatest challenges in its history...|$|R
