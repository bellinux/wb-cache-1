Especially {{in the early years}} of the breed's history, some {{inbreeding}} occurred, both by accident and design, which served to reinforce the breed's dominant characteristics. During the 1980s and 1990s, several studies were <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> morphological differences among the breed lines. Significant differences were found in some characteristics, including height and proportions; these have been used to help achieve breeding objectives, especially in Italy during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{indiscriminate}} breeding practices, as of 2001 only a few thousand purebred Marwaris existed. Research studies have been <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the genetics of the Marwari and its relationship to other Indian and non-Indian horse breeds. Six different breeds have been identified in India: the Marwari, Kathiawari, Spiti pony, Bhutia pony, Manipuri Pony, and Zanskari. These six are distinct from each other in terms of unique performance traits and different agroclimactic conditions in the various areas of India where they originated. A 2005 study was conducted to identify past genetic bottlenecks in the Marwari. The study found that, in the DNA of the horses tested, {{there was no evidence of}} a genetic bottleneck in the breed's history. However, since the population has decreased rapidly in past decades, bottlenecks may have occurred that were not identified in the study. In 2007, a study was conducted to assess genetic variation among all Indian horse breeds except the Kathiawari. Based on analysis of microsatellite DNA, the Marwari was found to be the most genetically distinct breed of the five studied, and was most distant from the Manipuri; none of the breeds were found to have close genetic ties to the Thoroughbred. The Marwari was distinguishable from the other breeds in terms of both physical characteristics (mainly height) and environmental adaptability. The physical differences were attributed to differing ancestries: the Marwari are closely associated with the Arabian horse, while the four other breeds are supposedly descended from the Tibetan pony.|$|E

They also searched for sequential dependencies within each shooter per set of 25 continuous shots, and employed a variety of novel techniques for isolating hot performance.

25|$|A {{study was}} <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the {{difference}} between the hot-hand and gambler's fallacy. The gambler's fallacy is the expectation of a reversal following a run of one outcome. Gambler's fallacy occurs mostly in cases in which people feel that an event is random, such as rolling a pair of dice on a craps table or spinning the roulette wheel. It is caused by the false belief that the random numbers of a small sample will balance out the way they do in large samples; this is known as the law of small numbers heuristic. The difference between this and the hot-hand fallacy is that with the hot-hand fallacy an individual expects a run to continue. There is a much larger aspect of the hot hand that relies on the individual. This relates to a person's perceived ability to predict random events, which is not possible for truly random events. The fact that people believe that they have this ability is in line with the illusion of control.|$|E

25|$|Otago Peninsula is {{regarded}} as one of the most favoured habitats for Southern right whales on mainland coasts, both currently and historically. They were seen frequently in the harbor to breed or calve until the arrival of Europeans. They were the primary target species for shore-whaling and was the major cause for Port Otago to be opened, and whales were hunted to almost extinct and whales were rarely seen on occasions such as in 1975. Their current visits into the harbor are very seldom and increased ship lanes and underwater noises may affect negatively on presences of whales, and some future studies might be <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> any solutions to bring back whales into the harbor. On occasions, they can be seen off the coast close to shore in their winter-migration season, along with Humpback whales, which were also hunted in the area. Today, quantities of occurrence between these species have become reversed due to drastic difference in biomasses. Taiaroa Head could be the spot with highest possibilities to catch glimpses of these giants. Other Baleen whales that have been confirmed in the area in recent times include Blue whales and Minke whales.|$|E
25|$|Researches on the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in sheep {{demonstrate}} that the volume of oSDN varies with sexual partner preference in male sheep (rams). Homosexual rams (roughly 8% of the population) {{have been found to}} have oSDNs that are about half the size of those in heterosexual rams. In one study conducted by Roselli, et al., 4 heterosexual rams and 9 homosexual rams were exposed to 2 estrous ewes and 2 rams, with their sexual behaviors (mounts and ejaculations) being recorded. Heterosexual rams displayed significantly more mounts and ejaculations with ewes than with stimulus rams, whereas homosexual rams showed the opposite. Then series of brain sections, including hypothalamic, temporal lobe and diencephalon tissues, were imaged. Also, in situ hybridization was <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the level of the expression of cytochrome P450 aromatase in these brain sections. The results showed that the volume of oSDN in heterosexual rams is approximately 2 times greater than that in homosexual rams. The number of neurons within oSDN is significantly greater in homosexual rams than in heterosexual rams, so it is with the mean length of the oSDN. But the neuron density is similar in both kinds of rams. In addition, aromatase mRNA levels are also tested, showing that the level of aromatase mRNA is significantly greater in heterosexual rams than in homosexual rams.|$|E
2500|$|Often {{laboratory}} studies with rats are <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear responses. In 2004, researchers conditioned rats (Rattus norvegicus) to fear a certain stimulus, through electric shock. The researchers {{were able to}} then cause an extinction of this conditioned fear, {{to a point that}} no medications or drugs were able to further aid in the extinction process. However the rats did show signs of avoidance learning, not fear, but simply avoiding the area that brought pain to the tests rats. The avoidance learning of rats is seen as a conditioned response, and therefore the behavior can be unconditioned, as supported by the earlier research.|$|E

The results revealed {{for the first time}} that the RIP band caused a marked change in the temperature distribution patterns under puffing. The band was also able to suppress smouldering well ahead of the approaching coal. The temperature gradient contours demonstrated the changes in the extent combustion, mostly caused by modification to the air influx during puffing. The coal volume fractions at different temperatures were quantified and compared to a non-RIP control cigarette. Possible implications of the observations on RIP cigarettes ignition testing and smoke composition were discussed...|$|R

When complex systems are concerned, these diagrams typically consist of {{a great amount of}} connected nodes â€“ particularly if they origin from reverse engineering processes. In software visualization research community various papers have been published arguing that displaying diagrams in 3 D or 2 D, i. e., on a plane seen under 3 D perspective, helps to cope with the size of the diagrams and supports users in exploring them.

The authors could not conclude whether women already experiencing these [...] "problems" [...] were drawn to the series, or if the series influenced these behaviours to occur after reading by creating underlying context. The study's lead researcher contends that the books romanticise dangerous behaviour and [...] "perpetuate dangerous abuse standards."

2500|$|In {{the years}} before the first {{large-scale}} excavations by Aharon Kempinski (1986-1993), surveys and smaller excavations were conducted to rescue artefacts and {{get an idea of}} the nature of Tel Kabri. This began when the archaeological remains of the tel were first discovered in the 1950s after kibbutzniks started coming across Neolithic artefacts near the local spring of Ein Giah. In 1956, on behalf of IDAM, the forerunner of today's Israel Antiquities Authority, David Alon and Daniel Rosolio conducted a survey in the area where the Neolithic artefacts had first been found earlier in the same year. They came across fortifications from the MB, and this survey led to salvage excavations in the following two years of what would later become Area A.
