5000|$|Coal {{blending}} is {{the process}} of mixing coals after coal has been mined to achieve quality attributes that are desirable for the coal’s intended application (e.g. steam generation, coking). [...] The quality attributes that are most important in blending will differ from one mine site to another and also depend on how the coal seams vary in quality and their final intended use. In thermal coals, quality attributes of interest often include ash, volatile matter, total Sulfur, and gross calorific value. For coking coals, additional attributes are sometimes considered including <b>crucible</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>number,</b> fluidity, and RoMax.|$|E

40|$|A {{dilatometer}} type apparatus {{has been}} used to measure the swelling pressure developed in a small coal sample during carbonisation at constant volume. A standard test procedure is outlined and the apparatus specified. Two types of results are given. In the first no corrections are made for effects not associated with the coal. These results, characteristic of the apparatus and standard test conditions, {{can be used as a}} quantitative measure of the swelling properties of coals, and are reproducible to ± 5 %. In the second set of results elimination of such effects is attempted. The values so obtained are for the pressure at a point in a coal change throughout carbonisation. These results show that swelling pressure occurs at lower temperatures than the associated property of volume increase, and is not due to volatile evolution through the plastic coal as the latter property is. The temperatures at which the maximum swelling occurs is rank dependent and has a range 200 - 350 °C in the rank range investigated. The magnitude of this maximum swelling pressure also increases with rank. It is also know that considerable shrinkage occurs in the coal sample after the maximum swelling pressure is developed. The results are correlated with the BSS 1016 <b>Crucible</b> <b>Swelling</b> Test Scale and experimental data is extrapolated in an attempt to obtain equivalent <b>swelling</b> <b>number</b> values for the arbitrary 9 ⁺, 9 ⁺⁺, 9 ⁺⁺⁺ designations at present used for high-swelling New Zealand coals. Values of 11 ½, 13 ½, 16 ½ respectively are predicted. Prediction of equivalent <b>swelling</b> <b>numbers</b> is also made using a percentage swelling – ultimate analysis formula. Similar values are obtained. The correlations show swelling properties to have a second order dependence on <b>swelling</b> <b>number.</b> The results before correction for extraneous efforts show an exponential dependence on <b>swelling</b> <b>number...</b>|$|R

Rural parents believed that because the League’s administration was city-centered, their children would be negatively influenced by city dwellers. In addition, land owning peasants were much more affected by the government’s revocation of private ownership, and many were uninterested in allowing their children to participate. For its part, the urban population viewed itself as superior to the peasants. They saw the rural members as backward and uneducated, and were angered by their <b>swelling</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R

30|$|Another shared {{strategy}} between Giordano and Uniqlo is {{that they}} positioned themselves with quality basic apparel products. Giordano’s brand positioning is defined as “Unisex casual wear for all ages” (Wirtz 2007), and Uniqlo similarly promotes its “Made for all” at every store worldwide. First, Giordano understood there was a <b>swelling</b> <b>number</b> of middle class consumers who needed quality values and affordable prices that matched the frugal nature in the Asia region. With this understanding of the market, the company pursued a “value for money” positioning based {{on a combination of}} keen prices and basic quality products (Dibb 1996; Khandelwal & Saxena 2010). The positioning strategy was successful among Asian customers with “guilt-free shopping” considering price compared to quality (Khandelwal & Saxena 2010; Seno 1999).|$|R

The new approach, which targeted the needs of youthful offenders rather than those of the older more chronic offenders, was conceptualized as [...] "remediation" [...] rather than rehabilitation. Remediation identifies and treats an inmate's particular deficits, as opposed to trying to effect change in their overall personality. In order to implement the remediation approach, the treatment staff was reorganized into smaller, more flexible units called RemediationManagement Teams (RMT’s). As well, treatment modules (such as Social Skills, Moral Problem Solving, and Relapse Prevention), as well as specialized programs (such as the Patuxent Drug Recovery Program, and the Sexual Offender Treatment Module), were introduced to broaden andenhance the traditional group therapy model.|$|R
