50|$|The Digital Classic Camera Leica M3 is a {{miniature}} replica camera with the outer appearance {{of an old}} Leica M3 viewfinder camera. It comes delivered in a massive wooden box. Its digital <b>camera</b> <b>processor</b> is made by Zoran. Its body is made of metal, covered with leatherette. Some of the metal levers are movable but without function. The camera is very small and light. A special flash in oldtime style is available for Minox's series of classic analog and digital replicas. Two buttons and the 2 digit display are the user interface, a special USB-cable must be plugged in as a computer interface.

40|$|A {{digital camera}} {{equipped}} with a processor for authentication of images produced from an image file taken by the digital camera is provided. The digital <b>camera</b> <b>processor</b> has embedded therein a private key unique to it, and the camera housing has a public key that is so uniquely based upon the private key that digital data encrypted with the private key by the processor may be decrypted using the public key. The digital <b>camera</b> <b>processor</b> comprises means for calculating a hash of the image file using a predetermined algorithm, and second means for encrypting the image hash with the private key, thereby producing a digital signature. The image file and the digital signature are stored in suitable recording means so they will be available together. Apparatus for authenticating at any time the image file as being free of any alteration uses the public key for decrypting the digital signature, thereby deriving a secure image hash identical to the image hash produced by the digital camera and used to produce the digital signature. The apparatus calculates from the image file an image hash using the same algorithm as before. By comparing this last image hash with the secure image hash, authenticity of the image file is determined if they match, since even one bit change in the image hash will cause the image hash to be totally different from the secure hash...|$|E

40|$|Hyperspectral imagers {{based on}} {{interferometry}} associate with each pixel {{of the image}} the spectrum calculated with the Fourier transform of the measured interferogram. This class of hyperspectral imagers is intrinsically faster than imagers based on optical filters and on dispersive means when the noise is dominated by detector noise. This speed advantage could be hampered by the large computing power necessary to extract the spectral content of the image from {{the large number of}} data acquired by the camera. We have realized a real-time algorithm to discriminate different spectra of the pixels of a scene directly from the acquired interferograms. The technique showed very good discrimination of pixels illuminated by narrow band radiation. This algorithm is based on principal component analysis and could be implemented directly in the <b>camera</b> <b>processor</b> to discriminate spectra in the image in real time using factorization with singular value decomposition...|$|E

The system consists of WiCa board (Wireless Camera board) and the methods developed using a smart <b>camera</b> <b>processor,</b> IC 3 D. IC 3 D is an SIMD video-analysis processor that has 320 processor elements. The proposed auto-rectification method is suitable for a parallel stereo system like WiCa.

After rectification, the two images of the background are coincident with each other, i. e., both the vertical and horizontal disparity of the background plane is removed. Then a dense matching method is implemented to achieve the depth map of the foreground object. Left-to-right checking and reliability checking is applied to reduce the error of the estimated depth. The system runs at 30 fps and handles disparity up to 37 pixels in CIF (320 x 240 pixels) mode. 1...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThanks to {{the rise}} of digital reflex cameras, RGB CMOS sensors present {{nowadays}} interesting features, at relatively low prices. For instance, the Canon 5 DSR sensor displays 50 million pixels. Nevertheless, such cameras being dedicated to photography and not to measurement, their high pixel density makes the associated sensor noise to be relatively high compared to the sensor noise of measurement cameras. Moreover, a Bayer filter mosaic is added in front of the pixels of such sensors in order to produce RGB images by interpolation. Embedded <b>camera</b> <b>processors</b> demosaice these data to elaborate full RGB pictures. Additional post-processing steps, including white balance and gamma correction, are also used in order to prevent any color shift and to give a pleasing-to-the-eye output. These post-processing steps considerably transform the raw sensor data to produce the output images. The fundamental assumption of DIC, namely the conservation of brightness for a given material point, may thus be violated. In this context, we propose in this study a consistent use of the separate channels of RGB sensors for the DIC minimization. The metrological performance of the DIC measurement using this approach is discussed and compared to that dealing with “classic” gray level images...|$|R
