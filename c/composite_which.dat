Basic layers are an outer shell of breathable polyethylene film or a nonwoven and film <b>composite</b> <b>which</b> prevents wetness and soil transfer, an inner absorbent layer of a mixture of air-laid paper and superabsorbent polymers for wetness, and a layer nearest the skin of nonwoven material with a distribution layer directly beneath which transfers wetness to the absorbent layer.|$|E
2500|$|Coming down to {{the present}} from Ancient Greek and Ancient Roman civilization, the Architectural Orders are the styles of {{classical}} architecture, each distinguished by its proportions and characteristic profiles and details, and most readily recognizable {{by the type of}} column employed. The three orders of architecture—the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian—originated in Greece. To these the Romans added, in practice if not in name, the Tuscan, which they made simpler than Doric, and the <b>Composite,</b> <b>which</b> was more ornamental than the Corinthian. [...] The Architectural Order of a classical building is akin to the mode or key of classical music, the grammar or rhetoric of a written composition. [...] It is established by certain modules like the intervals of music, and it raises certain expectations in an audience attuned to its language.|$|E
60|$|The not {{uncommon}} circumstance of slow-breeding animals being very numerous, {{shows that it}} is usually the amount of destruction which an animal or plant is exposed to, not its rapid multiplication, that determines its numbers in any country. The passenger-pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) is, or rather was, excessively abundant in a certain area in North America, and its enormous migrating flocks darkening the sky for hours have often been described; yet this bird lays only two eggs. The fulmar petrel exists in myriads at St. Kilda and other haunts of the species, yet it lays only one egg. On the other hand the great shrike, the tree-creeper, the nut-hatch, the nut-cracker, the hoopoe, and many other birds, lay from four to six or seven eggs, and yet are never abundant. So in plants, the abundance of a species bears little or no relation to its seed-producing power. Some of the grasses and sedges, the wild hyacinth, and many buttercups occur in immense profusion over extensive areas, although each plant produces comparatively few seeds; while several species of bell-flowers, gentians, pinks, and mulleins, and even some of the <b>composite,</b> <b>which</b> produce an abundance of minute seeds, many of which are easily scattered by the wind, are yet rare species that never spread beyond a very limited area.|$|E

40|$|Woven SiC/SiC {{composites}} {{represent a}} broad family of composites {{with a broad}} range of properties which are of interest for many energy-based and aero-based applications. Two important features of SiC/SiC <b>composites</b> <b>which</b> one must consider are the reinforcing fibers themselves and the fiber-architecture they are formed into. The range of choices for these two features can result {{in a wide range of}} elastic, mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. In this presentation, it will be demonstrated how the effect of fiber-type and fiber architecture effects the important property of "matrix cracking stress" for slurry-cast melt-infiltrated SiC matrix <b>composites,</b> <b>which</b> is often considered to be a critical design parameter for this system of composites...|$|R
6000|$|Of these phantasms and grotesques, one of {{some general}} {{importance}} is that commonly called Ionic, {{of which the}} idea was taken (Vitruvius says) from a woman's hair, curled; but its lateral processes look more like rams' horns: {{be that as it}} may, it is a mere piece of agreeable extravagance, and if, instead of rams' horns, you put ibex horns, or cows' horns, or an ass's head at once, you will have ibex orders, or ass orders, or any number of other orders, one for every head or horn. You may have heard of another order, the <b>Composite,</b> <b>which</b> is Ionic and Corinthian mixed, {{and is one of the}} worst of ten thousand forms referable to the Corinthian as their head: it may be described as a spoiled Corinthian. And you may have also heard of another order, called Tuscan (which is no order at all, but a spoiled Doric): and of another called Roman Doric, which is Doric more spoiled, both which are simply among the most stupid variations ever invented upon forms already known. I find also in a French pamphlet upon architecture,[95] as applied to shops and dwelling houses, a sixth order, the [...] "Ordre Français," [...] at least as good as any of the three last, and to be hailed with acclamation, considering whence it comes, there being usually more tendency on the other side of the channel to the confusion of [...] "orders" [...] than their multiplication: but the reader will find in the end that there are in very deed only two orders, of which the Greek, Doric, and Corinthian are the first examples, and they not perfect, nor in anywise sufficiently representative of the vast families to which they belong; but being the first and the best known, they may properly be considered as the types of the rest. The essential distinctions of the two great orders he will find explained in §§ XXXV. and XXXVI. of Chap. XXVII., and in the passages there referred to; but I should rather desire that these passages might be read in the order in which they occur.|$|E
