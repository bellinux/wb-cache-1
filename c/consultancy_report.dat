It {{turns out that the}} ‘research’ was in fact a number of <b>consultancy</b> <b>reports</b> {{conducted}} in the Northern Cape Province.

It is argued in this article that most of these papers are examples of how research of this nature should not be undertaken by scholars and that they represent an abdication of rather than a compromise of academic rigour. While scholars should be encouraged to write up their experiences of consultancy, this should be presented in a proper academic format rather than in consultant terminology. Indeed, some of the articles in top international Public Administration journals such as International Review of Administrative Sciences and Public Administration and Development are research articles that emanate out of <b>consultancy</b> <b>reports.</b> The difference between these international journals and this special edition is that the former journals’ consultancy articles are presented in an internationally accepted academic format...|$|R

50|$|Shocked by the announcement, {{several former}} students, some being specialists in {{landscaping}} and environmental science, proposed solutions {{to save the}} tree while making it safe for current students and the public. They were supported by over 2,000 Maryknollers who signed a petition on Facebook to conserve the tree. The school's suggestion that the tree be chopped into smaller pieces, to make souvenirs for students and former students, was denounced by many former Maryknollers as gruesome, analogous to ripping body parts from a corpse and sharing it among accomplices. Experts in the area, most notably Professor C.Y. Jim, Chair Professor of Geography at the University of Hong Kong, and Mr Ken So, of the Conservancy Association, were also involved in assessing the tree's health. It was assured that the tree, although tilting slightly, did not pose any immediate danger. It was later revealed that the consultancy appointed by the school earlier that year, which suggested removing the tree, had a conflict of interest, because the consultancy itself {{was also in the}} tree removal business. The company would potentially benefit from the removal works later on by presenting the case in a certain way.

The case study, regarded as a best practice TM case in the consultancy literature, shows that talent pool segmentation according to the abilities and competencies of employees are utilised rather than firstly identifying pools of positions and then finding individuals. Additionally and consistent with over half of the MNEs surveyed, the case firm identify talented employees other than leadership or managerial talent but also their key technical, functional employees...|$|R

Our analysis shows that headline cost estimates, including the influential paper by Collins and Lapsley (2008), depend on an incorrect procedure for incorporating real world imperfections in consumer information and rationality, producing a substantial over-estimate of costs. Other errors further inflate these estimates, resulting in headline costs that are unrelated to either total economic welfare or GDP and therefore of no policy relevance. Counting only external, policy-relevant costs not only deflates overall figures substantially but also results in rank order changes among cost categories. Despite this, Cost of Illness studies appear effective in mobilizing public opinion towards increased regulation and taxation that is not justified by an expected increase in economic welfare: this is the cost of cost studies. costs and benefits of alcohol usage; alcohol policy; Australia; New Zealand; adequacy of <b>consultancy</b> <b>reports...</b>|$|R

The report was cited by Law Commission President Sir Geoffrey Palmer as evidence in support of greater regulation, gaining considerable media coverage. We find substantial flaws in BERL’s method that together account for well over 90 % of BERL’s calculated costs of alcohol use. Corrected external costs of alcohol use amount to $ 662 million and are roughly matched by the $ 516 million collected in alcohol excise taxes.
