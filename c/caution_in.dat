5|$|Women and men {{differ in}} their {{chromosomal}} makeup, protein gene products, genomic imprinting, gene expression, signaling pathways, and hormonal environment. All of these necessitate <b>caution</b> <b>in</b> extrapolating information derived from biomarkers from one sex to the other. Women are particularly vulnerable at the two extremes of life. Young women and adolescents are at risk from STIs, pregnancy and unsafe abortion, while older women often have few resources and are disadvantaged with respect to men, and also {{are at risk of}} dementia and abuse, and generally poor health.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{continued}} to treat potential romantic partners with <b>caution.</b> <b>In</b> 1828, she met and flirted with the French writer Prosper Mérimée, but her one surviving letter to him {{appears to be}} a deflection of his declaration of love. She was delighted when her old friend from Italy, Edward Trelawny, returned to England, and they joked about marriage in their letters. Their friendship had altered, however, following her refusal to cooperate with his proposed biography of Percy Shelley; and he later reacted angrily to her omission of the atheistic section of Queen Mab from Percy Shelley's poems. Oblique references in her journals, from the early 1830s until the early 1840s, suggest that Mary Shelley had feelings for the radical politician Aubrey Beauclerk, who may have disappointed her by twice marrying others.|$|E
5|$|In 695, al-Hajjaj {{entrusted}} Ibn al-Ash'ath with 6,000 horsemen and {{the campaign}} against the Kharijite rebels under Shabib ibn Yazid ibn Nu'aym al-Shaybani. Although not large, this group benefited from Shabib's tactical skill and inflicted a number of defeats on Umayyad forces. Advised by the general al-Jazl Uthman ibn Sa'id, Ibn al-Ash'ath pursued the Kharijites but displayed great <b>caution</b> <b>in</b> order to avoid falling into a trap. As a result, the governor of al-Mada'in, Uthman ibn Qatan, wrote to al-Hajjaj criticizing Ibn al-Ash'ath's leadership. Al-Hajjaj responded by giving command to Uthman, but when the latter attacked Shabib, the Umayyad army suffered a heavy defeat, losing around 900 men and fleeing to Kufa; Uthman himself was killed, while Ibn al-Ash'ath, who lost his horse, managed to escape {{with the help of}} a friend and reached Kufa after an eventful journey. There he remained in hiding until al-Hajjaj granted him pardon.|$|E

5|$|Already in 1878, voices sounded for Reitz {{to run for}} the presidency, but President Brand's {{position}} was still very strong and Reitz openly praised his qualities and refused to stand against him. In the late 1870s and early 1880s the political temperature ran high in the Orange Free State. The annexation of the South African Republic (Transvaal) by the British in 1877 and the First Anglo-Boer War of 1880–1881 in which that republic regained its autonomy impacted deeply on political sentiments in the Orange Free State. On the one hand there were those who propagated <b>caution</b> <b>in</b> the relationship with the British, on the other there developed a political movement that strongly propagated a (reawakened) Afrikaner national consciousness. Reitz was part of the latter, and together with C.L.F. Borckenhagen, editor of the Bloemfontein Express newspaper, he wrote a constitution for the Afrikaner Bond (Afrikaner Union), a political party originally set up by leading Afrikaner politicians in the Cape Colony, like Rev S.J. du Toit and his Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners ('Society of True Afrikaners') and Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr and the Zuidafrikaansche Boeren Beschermings Vereeniging ('South African Boer Protection Association'). Among the supporters of this new Afrikaner nationalism in the Orange Free State was also Reitz's successor, M.T. Steyn, then still a young lawyer. The constitution was presented in April 1881, and several months later Reitz became the chairman of the Bond. His overt political activities earned Reitz criticism from those who feared a breakdown of relations with the British. It is obvious, however, that a wind of change was blowing through the Boer republics and among the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony, which was to change Anglo-Boer relations drastically.|$|E

40|$|In Canada, {{the rights}} to silence and legal counsel are communicated to {{suspects}} through passages of text known as police cautions. Previous research on comprehension of <b>cautions</b> <b>in</b> Canada, the United States, England and Wales, and Scotland has shown that people rarely comprehend the information contained <b>in</b> police <b>cautions.</b> <b>In</b> the current study, the level of comprehension of two police <b>cautions</b> <b>in</b> a sample of Canadian offenders was investigated, along with the relationship between comprehension, education, and three measures of cognitive ability. Participants (n₁ = 60) were asked to comprehend both a right-to-silence and right-to-legal counsel caution that was presented to them verbally. Comprehension was measured using free recall and recognition tasks (13 -item true-false test). Participants {{were also asked to}} complete select subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales - Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; Digit Span and Vocabulary) and a subtest of the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement - Third Edition (WJ-III; Understanding Directions). The results showed that participants demonstrated a poor understanding of their legal rights, as the average comprehension score was 30...|$|R
