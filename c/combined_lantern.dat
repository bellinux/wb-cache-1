50|$|The lantern shield {{is small}} shield <b>combined</b> with a <b>lantern,</b> in {{use during the}} Italian Renaissance (15th and 16th century Italy) {{especially}} for nighttime duels. A number of specimens survive. Their defining feature is a small circular shield -- a buckler -- <b>combined</b> with a <b>lantern,</b> or a hook from which to hang a lantern, intended to blind the opponent at night or in duels fought at dawn.|$|R
50|$|Shows that <b>combined</b> magic <b>lantern</b> {{slides and}} films were common at the time, but the {{addition}} of recorded speech was unusual, and the magnitude of its distribution for a single religious production was particularly notable. At the time, the project's full cost was estimated at about $300,000 (current value $).|$|R
5000|$|In 1934 a {{group of}} explorers {{proposed}} a [...] "geographic theater" [...] to be located in Manhattan devoted to [...] "programs <b>combining</b> motion pictures, <b>lantern</b> slides, lectures and native music and dancing". Millward {{was to be the}} program director.|$|R

50|$|In the Neburi Nagashi around Akita city, people {{decorated}} silk {{trees and}} bamboo grasses with strips {{of paper on}} which they had written their wishes. Then, they walked around the city with them and floated them downstream. In Neburi Nagashi, people <b>combined</b> candles and <b>lanterns.</b> This instrument for Neburi Nagashi became called Kanto.|$|R
2500|$|Super Friends was {{mentioned}} {{at the end of}} the StarKid Productions musical Holy Musical B@man!. At the end of the musical, Batman, Robin, Superman, and the Green <b>Lantern</b> <b>combine</b> to form a [...] "league of justice" [...] they call the Super Friends. This group consists of some of the members of the original Super Friends as well as some new additions.|$|R
5000|$|Within days of Titanics sinking, {{newsreels}} {{and even}} slide shows were playing in crowded cinemas and theatres in the United States and Europe. By {{the end of}} April 1912, no fewer than nine American companies had issued sets of Titanic slides that could be bought or rented for public showings, accompanied by posters, lobby photos, lecture scripts and sheet music. They were intended to be shown {{as part of a}} mixed programme <b>combining</b> magic <b>lantern</b> slides with short dramatic, comic and scenic films. Charles A. Pryor of New York's Pryor and Clare was among the first photographers to make it aboard the Carpathia on her return from the scene of the sinking and took many pictures of Captain Rostron, the Titanics survivors and Carpathias crew. His subsequent advertising, published in the New York Clipper, emphasised the likely level of popular interest: ...|$|R
50|$|Two police {{officers}} arrive at Chuck McGill's house after his neighbor calls 911 {{to report the}} stolen newspaper. Chuck refuses {{to open the door}} for the officers due to his electromagnetic hypersensitivity. One officer walks around to the basement door, where he finds that the breaker lines have been cut and several empty cans of camping fuel for Chuck's stove and <b>lanterns.</b> <b>Combined</b> with Chuck's ramblings, the two officers mistakenly deduce that Chuck is a drug user, kick down the front door, and taser him.|$|R
50|$|In 1848, a theatre {{was added}} to the building, {{purpose-built}} to accommodate the growing audiences for the Polytechnic’s optical shows. These <b>combined</b> magic <b>lantern</b> images with live performances, music, ghosts and spectres, illuminated fountains and fireworks in increasingly sophisticated displays, spreading the fame of what was arguably the world’s first permanent projection theatre. ‘Professor’ John Henry Pepper joined the Polytechnic in the 1840s. Probably best known today for his illusion ‘Pepper’s Ghost’, his contribution to education deserves recognition. Pepper established evening classes in engineering, applied science and technical subjects for young working Londoners, beginning the tradition of widening access to education continued by the University of Westminster today. Expansion gradually gave way to financial difficulty, reflecting a long-standing tension between education and the need to run a successful business. A fatal accident on the premises in 1859 caused the first institution to be wound up and a new one formed. Various regeneration schemes were considered, but in 1879 a fire damaged the roof, precipitating the final crisis.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the Sinestro Corps War plotline, Ganthet and Sayd {{are shown}} living on the planet Odym. There they harness the blue energy of hope, one of the lights of the {{emotional}} spectrum. In preparation for [...] "The Blackest Night" [...] and motivated by their hope for life in the universe, they plan the formation of their own Corps: the Blue <b>Lanterns.</b> <b>Combining</b> their abilities to form the first blue power ring, both Guardians evolve into two new beings capable of hope for others and each other. The first recruit welcomed to their new Corps is Saint Walker, who assists them by beginning a chain of new Blue Lanterns inducted sector by sector. Among Ganthet and Sayd's plans to combat [...] "The Blackest Night" [...] are to have Hal Jordan lead the Blue Lantern Corps (powering the entire organization with his willpower), and also to form an alliance with the Indigo Tribe.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{developed}} from a paper {{delivered to the}} Visual Delights conference at the University of Sheffield in 2002, concentrating on film exhibition in Brighton and Hove in 1896 - 97 and, as such, represents {{the initial stages of}} research for an early film exhibition history of Brighton and Hove that Gray was to curate (output 1). This wider history begins {{with the arrival of the}} Kinetoscope in 1895 and concludes with the opening of the first purpose-built cinemas in 1909 - 10. It is shaped by the need to conceptualise the dynamic and holistic relationship between production and exhibition within film culture as it evolved within one particular place. Gray’s research recognises the fact that the history of film exhibition in Britain before the First World War had not previously been systematically chronicled and analysed. In 2006 at the Ninth International Domitor Conference, held at the University of Michigan, Gray presented a paper on film exhibition in Brighton from 1897 to 1900, focusing on the rise of patriotic multi-media entertainments that <b>combined</b> film with <b>lantern</b> slides, music, song and narration. It will be published as part of the conference proceedings in either 2007 or 2008. Domitor is the international early cinema society. The triennial Visual Delights conference is allied to Early Popular Visual Culture (Routledge), the peer-reviewed journal dedicated to popular visual culture before 1930. Gray is one of the journal’s associate editors...|$|R
