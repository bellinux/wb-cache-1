50|$|Hemp juice <b>cold-pressed</b> <b>from</b> {{industrial}} hemp {{prior to}} seed maturation is an emulsion. This is {{because at the}} best time of harvest for industrial fiber the green hemp also contains the special omega oils, most cannabinoids {{as well as the other}} valuable ingredients in the suspended particles. All hemp varieties with a THC content of below 0,2% classify as industrial hemp in Europe (below 0.3% in the US and Canada) and are defined as drug-free foods and therefore legal under EU, US and Canadian law.|$|R
25|$|Hemp seeds can {{be eaten}} raw, ground into a meal, sprouted, or made into dried sprout powder. The {{leaves of the}} hemp plant can be {{consumed}} raw in salads. Hemp can also {{be made into a}} liquid and used for baking or for beverages such as hemp milk, hemp juice, and tea. Hempseed oil is <b>cold-pressed</b> <b>from</b> the seed and is high in unsaturated fatty acids. In 2011, the U.S. imported $11.5 million worth of hemp products, mostly driven by growth in demand for hemp seed and hemp oil for use as ingredients in foods such as granola.|$|R

50|$|In 1859, {{the second}} Sixth Street Bridge {{was built by}} John Roebling, who built this bridge as his third and final bridge in Pittsburgh.

30|$|Our {{results showed}} {{the release of}} nickel and {{chromium}} ions <b>from</b> orthodontic <b>wires</b> in mouthwashes but not in distilled water. This release <b>from</b> SS <b>wires</b> was less than that <b>from</b> NiTi <b>wires.</b> At all time-points, release of both ions in Listerine was the highest <b>from</b> both <b>wires.</b> However, the rate of release of nickel <b>from</b> SS <b>wire</b> at 24  h and 1  week in Listerine {{was similar to that}} in Oral B 3 D White Luxe. The amount of released chromium ions at 1  week <b>from</b> SS <b>wire</b> in Oral B 3 D White Luxe was higher than that in Listerine. It seems that Oral B 3 D White Luxe caused greater release of ions at 1  week. Also, our results showed that the lowest release of ions occurred in Oral B, although the release of chromium ions <b>from</b> NiTi <b>wire</b> did not completely follow this trend.|$|R
