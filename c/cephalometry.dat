50|$|Ultrasound <b>cephalometry</b> {{is useful}} for {{determining}} baby growth in utero. <b>Cephalometry</b> can also determine if an unborn child will pass through the birth canal. Certain 3D imaging applications are now used in obstetric <b>cephalometry.</b> In 1961, Donald and Brown employed ultrasound technique for measurement of the fetal head. Other scientists tried the method {{and found that the}} ultrasound technique was 3mm different than the post-natal measurement with calipers. This method requires that the transponder be placed on the maternal abdomen over the area of the fetal head. The transponder is moved until a pair of echos are strong and equal. This indicates that the parietals are perpendicular to the transmitting beam. The distance of the reflections equal the biparietal diameter. From this, the size of the head and the fetal weight can be determined with incredible accuracy. The use of ultrasound <b>cephalometry</b> is meant to be used in addition to other radiographic techniques. Thus far, no ill effects have been reported to the fetus or the mother using the ultrasound fetal <b>cephalometry.</b>|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of the relapse in {{patients}} with craniofacial malformation who underwent craniofacial advancement surgery is very difficult, and data are often unreliable. This is because common skeletal landmarks move from their original position, making standard <b>cephalometries</b> completely useless. To solve this problem, some authors proposed evaluations based on 2 - and 3 -dimensional computed tomographies, but the biologic risk and the economic outcome do not consent to repeat this kind of examination too often.

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{development}} of face and hyoid bone in children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) through lateral <b>cephalometries.</b> Materials and methods: Children aged 7 - 10 years with mixed dentition and with no previous otorhinolaryngologic, orthodontic or speech therapy treatments were studied. Twenty nasal breathers were compared to 20 mouth breathing children diagnosed as OSAS patients. All children underwent otorhinolaryngologic evaluation and cephalometries; children with OSAS also underwent nocturnal polysomnography in a sleep laboratory. Results: Children with OSAS presented increase in total and lower anterior heights of the face when compared to nasal breathers. In addition, children with OSAS presented a significantly more anterior and inferior position of the hyoid bone than nasal breathers. No significant differences in upper, anterior or posterior heights of the face were observed between groups. Conclusion: The results {{suggest that there are}} evident and early changes in facial growth and development among children with OSAS, characterized by increased total and inferior anterior heights of the face, as well as more anterior and inferior position of the hyoid bone.

Mutations in FGFR 1 genes affect skull development, specifically suture and synchondrosis, resulting in craniosynostosis and facial abnormalities. We examined subjects with normal skull morphology for genetic polymorphisms that might be associated with normal craniofacial variations. Genomic DNA was obtained from 216 Japanese and 227 Korean subjects. Four FGFR 1 SNPs, namely, rs 881301, rs 6996321, rs 4647905, and rs 13317, were genotyped. These SNPs were tested for association with craniofacial measurements obtained from lateral and posteroanterior <b>cephalometries,</b> in which principle component analysis was performed to compress the data of the craniofacial measurements. We observed that SNPs rs 13317 and rs 6996321 were correlated with the overall head size and midfacial development, indicating that FGFR 1 SNPs played crucial roles in the normal variation of human craniofacial morphology. Subjects with the derived alleles of SNPs rs 13317 and rs 6996321 had a small face and a facial pattern associated with a retruded midface and relatively wide-set eyes.

The amount of chin forward movement {{in addition to}} morphologic changes in bony structure, determines the final profile of treated patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the amount of morphologic changes of symphysis after chin cup therapy in skeletally Cl III patients. Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, twenty eight <b>cephalometries</b> before and after chin cup therapy of 14 skeletally Cl III patients were analyzed. Landmarks introduced by Ricketts were determined to evaluate the symphysis and describe its relation to mandible. َAlso four additional measurements regarding the symphysis individually were evaluated and analyzed.

Results: The results showed that the height of symphysis increased after treatment (P= 0. 02), but its depth decreased (P= 0. 04). The sysmphysis turned down and back. Conclusion: These findings suggest that in Cl III malocclusions with a prognathic mandible, chin cup therapy creates changes in the horizontal dimension of symphysis morphology, which improves the Cl III profile. If the patient isn't a vertical grower, vertical changes of symphysis would be desirable. In addition, changes in the vertical dimension of the mandible (body and ramus) could be observed as a backward and downward rotation...|$|R

A sample group was chosen of 38 individuals with normal occlusion, composed of 16 females and 22 males between the ages of 8 and 18. The total sample was divided into three groups: prepubescent (8 - 11 years), pubescent (12 - 14 years) and post-pubescent (15 - 18 years). A series of cephalometric angle parameters (SNA, maxillary height, slope of the palatal plane and maxillary depth) and lineal parameters (effective maxillary length, palatal plane length, middle third of the face height and convexity) were traced.

40|$|Background: For {{determining}} the cervical column curvature, the curve fitting method {{is the most}} precise method, but using this method in clinic seems to be difficult if not possible. In this study, we used a modification of cervical column inclination angle that has been already mentionedObjectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the posture and curvature of the cervical column introducing a modified constructed angle in order to evaluate the cervical column curvature in a relax position in relation to the jaws sagittal position. Patients and Methods: The lateral <b>cephalometries</b> of patients with no anomaly were taken in the natural head position. The mean age of the patients was 13. 49 years including 56 female and 44 male. Steiner and Wits analysis was used to evaluate the sagittal position of the jaws. Modified constructed CVT/HOR and OPT/HOR angles were used to evaluate the cervical column posture and curvature. Patients were classified into three groups according to the angle’s classification.

40|$|Background and Aims: Cl II {{malocclusion}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common abnormalities in human societies and using a simple, affordable and accessible treatment that can be provided by general practitioners or specialists, to prevent future malocclusion complications is vital. Cl II malocclusion treatment using functional appliances such as twin block and anterior inclined bite plan have less cost, side effects and complications compared to fixed orthodontic or orthosurgery. Until now, the dentoskeletal changes resulting from the application of twin block and anterior inclined bite plan in patients with Class II malocclusion has not been evaluated. The objective of the present study was to assess the dentoskeletal changes following the use of twin-block functional appliance and inclined anterior bite plan in the patients with class II malocclusion div 1 during mixed dentition. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective cohort trial, 60 patients with the definitive diagnosis of Class II div. 1 malocclusion having ANB> 2 and FMA angel between 20 and 30 and without any previous treatment or syndrome who were treated with twin-block or inclined anterior bite plan appliance were selected and their lateral <b>cephalometries</b> were traced before and after treatment. Selected distance and angular landmarks were measured on the cephalograms with the good reliability (ICC= 0. 953) and the changes occurred in the landmarks were statistically analyzed using Student t test. Results: Due to the increased mandibular growth, most of the landmarks experienced significant changes following the treatment with twin-block and inclined bite plan (P 0. 05), however, SNA (P= 0. 04), overjet (P= 0. 007) and wits appraisal (P= 0. 004) changed differently after using the appliances. Conclusion: Despite with most similarities of both twin-block and anterior inclined bite plan to correct class II div. 1 malocclusion, Due to the advantages of anterior inclined bite plan such as less size, good patient cooperation and simple laboratory preparations the appliance can be used as substitute for complex functional appliances to correct class II div. 1 malocclusion before the growth spurt...|$|R
5000|$|An Asian {{study was}} {{performed}} on children ages 3-13 who had obstructive sleep apnea. The study concluded that four cephalometric anthropomorphic parameters {{were related to the}} apnea-hypopnea index. Three of which indicated the importance of hyoid position in pediatric sleep apnea. Future studies are needed in this area. A Scottish study used cephalometric radiographs in order to find cause of sleep apnea. This {{was performed on}} adult men and women and found that location of the hyoid also correlates with the obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). The longer the distance of the hyoid to the mandibular plane along with a shorter mandibular corpus showed significantly associated with OSAHS. Compared with a control group, those with OSAHS had the hyoid bone lower in relation to the mandibular plane. By using a cephalometric analysis program, a study was able to conclude that people with a reduced midface length and an inferiorly placed hyoid tend to have smaller airways which can lead to obstructive sleep apnea. Lateral cephalography is useful in analyzing skeletal and soft tissue characteristics. They recorded 22 measurements from the lateral cephalograms and craniometric landmarks were digitized. In other studies, differences in characteristics were noted in the sagital and vertical planes of apnea sufferers versus the controls. This study did not find these differences between their groups.

50|$|The {{history of}} <b>cephalometry</b> {{can be traced}} through art, science, and anthropology. The origins of the {{important}} method of measuring has its origins in the Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci {{is perhaps the most}} well known scientist and artist studying facial proportions during the Renaissance. Da Vinci along with others utilized grids to study the proportions of the face and make generalizations about them. Da Vinci looked for divine proportions in his quest to understand facial proportions. Interestingly, the divine proportion has since been found to exist in 20th centuries of facial proportions as they relate to esthetics. Beginning with Petrus Camper in the 18th century angles began to be employed in the measurement of facial form. Camper also began the practice of ethnographic grouping based on facial form. Anders Retzius defined the cephalic index and classified different shapes of the head. Brachycephalic refers to a small, rounded head. Dolichocephalic refers to a long head. Mesocephalic refers to a medium-sized head, typically between the brachycephalic and dolichocephalic sizes.|$|E
50|$|Advances in {{technology}} have allowed scientists and anthropologists to utilize statistical programs {{in order to}} estimate ancestry of a skull by taking measurements of various craniometric points. CRANID is a statistical program that is used when {{the source of a}} cranium is of unknown origin. Cranial measurements are taken and entered into a worldwide craniometric database that is compared to other known cranial metrics. This information allows the user to be able to estimate ancestry in archaeological, forensic, and repatriation context. It has highest accuracy when sex is able to be determined. Dolphin Imaging Cephalometric and Tracing Software is a cephalometric analysis that can measure airway dimensions and dentofacial parameters. It has been used for studies in obstructive sleep apnea. As <b>cephalometry</b> become more digitized by using different programs and scanners, caution should be taken when interpreting data. Objects measured by computer assisted methods may not be an exact match of the original. Scanning and surface reconstruction can produce some data measurement uncertainty. There have been known cases of different software producing different data even when the same skull is used under the same conditions. Software packages, AMIRA and TIVMI, were used for surface reconstructions. The mean difference between measurements was lower for TIVMI. AMIRA can produce up to 4% error in known measurements and 5% in dry skull measurements. Error rates should be taken into consideration when using digitized software for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|One way {{in which}} cephalograms can be {{utilized}} is for accurate age estimation but not for sex estimation. One study confirmed that the mandibular ramus length is strongly related to chronological age and can be utilized to predict whether an individual is older than 18 years or older with a highly significant degree of accuracy (95% confidence interval). If the ramus length is 7.0 cm or more, then the individual has an 81.25% probability of being 18 years or older. Further, the study confirmed {{that there is not}} a strong degree of sexual dimorphism between mandibular ramus length until an individual reaches 16 years of age. The accuracy of predicting sex with mandibular ramus length is only 54% making it an unreliable indicator of sex in forensic contexts. The study also has impacts for providing age estimation of living people. This could be applicable in immigration, criminal and civil investigations, adoption of children, or old-age pension requests.The study utilized scanned cephalometric radiographs to conduct the study. <b>Cephalometry</b> remains to be the most popular and useful method for investigating the craniofacial skeletal morphology. Skull measurements are also important for facial reconstruction in cases of disputed identity. In the Punjab study, the mesocephalic was the most common craniotype followed by dolicocephalic in the tropical regions.The brachycephalic was more common in the temperate regions. Genetic and environmental factors have been suggested for the presence of variations in cephalic indices among population groups. Dietary habits have also been shown to modulate the craniofacial form of people. The data this study gathered is only valid for the adult population and may be useful in future forensic contexts.|$|E

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: Lateral <b>cephalometry</b> {{has been}} widely used to {{characterize}} facial and maxillary morphology in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. It is a useful tool to assess orthodontic and maxillofacial procedures, but transverse dimensions of the airway (e. g., nasal framework) have not been well described yet by <b>cephalometry.</b> We explored whether postero-anterior <b>cephalometry</b> could refine {{the analysis of the}} facial morphology, with a special attention paid to nasal morphology. We validated cephalometric measurements relevant to the diagnosis of OSA. Study Design: Controlled study. Methods: We explored postero-anterior and lateral cephalometric bony structures in OSA patients and in control subjects to determine which were predictive of an association with OSA. Healthy volunteers paired for age and sex to OSA patients underwent polysomnography and <b>cephalometry.</b> Data were analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk, Fisher, Wilcoxon, and paired t tests where appropriate. Results: Nasal fossae and maxillary bone proportions were positively and independently associated with the absence of OSA. Measurements of maxillary width, nasal fossae angle, and anterior skull base contributed to the characterization of OSA patients.

30|$|The current {{operational}} {{plan for the}} conventional orthognathic surgery is based on analysis of lateral <b>cephalometry</b> to determine the moving amount and posteroanterior (PA) <b>cephalometry</b> to investigate maxillary canting and asymmetry of chin [9]. Occlusal plane angle and incisal inclination based on analysis of lateral <b>cephalometry</b> is an important measurement in the plan for rotational orthognathic surgery with maxillary posterior impaction [10].

The investigation mostly used is lateral <b>cephalometry.</b> Reliable measurement of individual gonial angle is very difficult, because of the superimposed images appearing on the lateral cephalogerams. This disadvantage is not encountered in panoramic radiography. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the potential of panoramic radiograph to accurately measure gonial angle. Materials & Methods: In this cross- sectional study, standard panoramic and lateral <b>cephalometry</b> radiographs were taken for 281 patients by mean age of 9 - 10 years. Gonial angle from panoramic and lateral <b>cephalometry</b> radiographs was measured. The measurements were analyzed by paired student t- test. Results: Paired t- test was performed to check for similarity between the measurements. No significant differences were found between the gonial angle when comparing panoramic and lateral <b>cephalometry</b> radiographs (p value > 0. 05); also no significant differences between right and left gonial angle of individuals were found (p value > 0. 05).
