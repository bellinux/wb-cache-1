They have also used songs after a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time: an example is 'King Park', which although was initially considered too emotionally draining for live performances, the band eventually started to play the song live. The band played 'St Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' from Wildlife at its first performance in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|Enforcement of the HOS is {{generally}} handled by DOT officers of each state, and are sometimes checked when CMVs pass through weigh stations. Drivers {{found to be}} {{in violation of the}} HOS can be forced to stop driving for a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, which may negatively affect the motor carrier's safety rating. Requests to change the HOS are a source of contentious debate, and many surveys indicate some drivers get away with routinely violating the HOS. These facts have started another debate on whether motor carriers should be required to use ELDs in their vehicles, instead of relying on paper-based log books.|$|E

5|$|Once formed, {{proteins}} only {{exist for}} a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time and are then degraded and recycled by the cell's machinery {{through the process}} of protein turnover. A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. They can exist for minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1â€“2 days in mammalian cells. Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable.|$|E
5|$|The major {{obstacle}} preventing full New London service is the {{bridge over the}} Connecticut River between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme. The drawbridge section is closed for a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time to allow trains to pass, which prevents large boats from passing under. The Marine Trades Association opposes additional service, which would mandate more bridge closings. The 2003 agreement with Amtrak limited weekday traffic over the bridge to 2 SLE and 39 Amtrak trains until 2018, although it was revised in 2010 and 2013. Since 2003, New London had been served by cross-honored Amtrak trains plus one or two dedicated SLE roundtrips.|$|E
5|$|However, later {{research}} suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 Ncm) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months. The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{format for}} the World Championship {{features}} 16 {{teams in the}} championship group, 12 teams in Division I and 12 teams in Division II. If {{there are more than}} 40 teams, the rest compete in Division III. The teams in the championship play a preliminary round, then the top eight teams play in the playoff medal round and the winning team is crowned World Champion. Over the years, the tournament has gone through several rule changes. In 1969 body-checking in all three zones in a rink was allowed, helmets and goaltender masks became mandatory in the early 1970s and in 1992 the IIHF began using the shootout. The current IIHF rules differ slightly from the rules used in the NHL. The World Championships have been open to all players, both professional and amateur, since 1977. The IIHF requires that players are citizens of the country they represent and allow players to switch national teams provided that they play in their new nation for a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time.|$|E
5|$|Tigranes, who was {{residing}} at Tigranocerta in {{the summer}} of 69, was not only astonished by the speed of Lucullus' rapid advance into Armenia but {{by the fact that he}} had even launched such an operation in the first place. Unable to reconcile with this reality for a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, he belatedly sent a general named Mithrobarzanes with 2,000 to 3,000 cavalrymen to slow down Lucullus' advance but his forces were cut to pieces and routed by the 1,600 cavalry led by Sextilius, one of the legates serving under Lucullus. Learning of Mithrobarzanes' defeat, Tigranes entrusted the defense of his namesake city to Mancaeus and left to recruit a fighting force in the Taurus Mountains. Nevertheless, Lucullus' legates were able to disrupt two separate detachments coming to the aid of Tigranes and even located and engaged the king's forces in a canyon in the Taurus. Lucullus, nevertheless, chose not to pursue Tigranes while he had an unimpeded path towards Tigranocerta; he advanced and began to lay siege to it.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} American Jews who immigrated to Israel and gained Israeli citizenship, {{lived there for}} a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, and then {{returned}} to the United States is more difficult to estimate, ranging 30,000 and 60,000 by 1990, and between 53,000 and 75,000 by 2000. In total during that year, the number of Israeli Jews (those who were born in Israel and those who only lived there for a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time) who lived in the United States stood between 153,000 and 175,000.|$|E

He does, however, receive support from Ariadne Oliver, and from a vicar's wife (Mrs Dane Calthrop) who desires him to stop {{whatever}} evil may be taking place. He also makes an ally of Ginger Corrigan, a girl whom he has met in the area, and who successfully draws Poppy out about the Pale Horse organisation. She obtains from her an address in Birmingham where he meets Mr Bradley, a disbarred lawyer who outlines to him {{the means by which}} the Pale Horse functions without breaking the law, i.e. Bradley bets that someone will die within a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time and the client bets otherwise. If the person in question does die within a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, then the client must pay or else (one client who refused fell in front of an oncoming train and was killed).|$|E
25|$|The Boston Marathon {{is open to}} runners 18 {{or older}} from any nation, but they must meet certain {{qualifying}} standards. To qualify, a runner must first complete a standard marathon course certified by a national governing body affiliated with the International Association of Athletics Federations within a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time before {{the date of the}} desired Boston Marathon (usually within approximately 18 months prior).|$|E

25|$|Some {{legal systems}} regard a wreck (and/or its cargo) to be {{abandoned}} if no attempt is made to salvage them within a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time.

25|$|During the Soviet era, as {{the city}} was expanding, the number of raions also {{gradually}} increased. These newer districts of the city, along with some older areas were then named in honour of prominent communists and socialist-revolutionary figures; however, due {{to the way in}} which many communist party members eventually, after a <b>certain</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, fell out of favour and so were replaced with new, fresher minds, so too did the names of Kiev's districts change accordingly.|$|E
