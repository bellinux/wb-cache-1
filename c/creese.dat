25|$|William Charles Leonard <b>Creese</b> (27 December 1907 – 9 March 1974) was a South African born English {{first-class}} cricketer. <b>Creese</b> was a left-handed batsman who bowled left-arm medium pace.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creese</b> died at Buckland, Kent on 9 March 1974.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creese</b> {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Hampshire in the 1928 County Championship against Somerset. <b>Creese</b> represented Hampshire in 278 first-class matches from 1928 to 1939, with his first-class career with Hampshire ending {{due to the}} start of the Second World War. Creese's final appearance for the county came in the 1939 County Championship against Yorkshire at Dean Park Cricket Ground in Bournemouth.|$|E
50|$|During <b>Creese's</b> long {{presidency}} at Drexel, {{many changes}} occurred in every academic department. One {{of the changes}} involved cooperative education which began {{to be included in}} the curriculum of more departments and was more connected to academic study. A new emphasis on research resulted in Drexel receiving state aid for projects. During <b>Creese's</b> administration Drexel aimed to be a school similar to MIT, with an emphasis on technology, but also a strong humanities department in the undergraduate division. Students in all of the individual schools, including engineering and business, received a humanities education.|$|R

50|$|During <b>Creese's</b> {{presidency}} Drexel built a {{large number}} of new facilities including the Engineering Laboratories Building (1950), a Basic Science Center (1955), the Korman Library Center (1959), a Campus Activities Center (1962), and a Classroom-Laboratories Building (1963).|$|R
25|$|<b>Creese</b> {{was also}} a {{consistent}} bowler, taking 401 wickets for the county at a bowling average of 27.78, with 15 five wicket hauls and 1 ten wicket haul in a match, with best bowling figures of 8/37 against Lancashire in 1936. The 1936 season was Creese's best with the ball, during which he took 95 wickets {{at an average of}} 22.93, with 5 five wicket hauls and best figures of 8/37. It was during the 1936 season that <b>Creese</b> narrowly missed out on the all-rounders double, scoring 1,331 runs and coupled with 95 wickets, bringing him just short of the 1,000 runs and 100 wickets mark. In addition to his batting and bowling, <b>Creese</b> {{was also a}}n able fielder, taking 190 catches for Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Prior to joining Dorset <b>Creese</b> {{stood as}} an Umpire in three Minor Counties fixtures; two in 1947 {{and one in}} 1948. After this <b>Creese</b> served as a Groundsman at the Central Recreation Ground at Hastings for some years, during which his small grandson, whom he idolised, was killed by the heavy roller in the {{interval}} between innings in a Festival match. He later became head groundsman at the Sussex County Ground at Hove.|$|E
25|$|<b>Creese</b> was {{regarded}} as one of the best all-rounders on the county circuit. In his 278 matches for the county, <b>Creese</b> scored 9,894 runs at a batting average of 24.01, with 50 half centuries, 6 centuries with a high score of 241 against Northamptonshire in 1939. Such was Creese's skill with the bat that he passed the 1,000 run mark for a season five times, with his best season being in 1933 when he scored 	1,275 runs at an average of 35.41, with 5 half centuries, 2 centuries and a high score of 165*.|$|E
60|$|Hearing {{the cry of}} “Los juramentados!” the {{soldiers}} seized their arms. The juramentados rushed on them fearlessly, their <b>creeses</b> clutched in their hands. The bullets fell like hail among them. They bent, crept, glided, and struck. One of them, whose breast was pierced through and through by a bullet, rose and flung himself on the troops. He was again transfixed by a bayonet; he remained erect, vainly trying to reach his enemy, who held him impaled on the weapon. Another soldier had to run up and blow the man’s brains out before he let go his prey. When {{the last of the}} juramentados had fallen, and the corpses were picked up from the street which consternation had rendered empty, it was found that these eleven men had, with their <b>creeses,</b> hacked fifteen soldiers to pieces, not to reckon the wounded.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the short-term recovery response at 2 salmon farms in southern Tasmania where organic loads were equivalent, but where background environmental conditions differed markedly. Although benthic communities {{at each of the}} farm locations showed good recovery over the 3 mo fallow period, community structure did not fully return to that observed under reference conditions at either location. At the Stringers Cove site the primary ecological functions of the background community were restored, but {{this was not the case}} at <b>Creeses</b> Mistake. These differences in recovery response were a direct reflection of background environmental conditions. Stringers Cove sediments had naturally high organic carbon content and as a result there was greater similarity in the ecological function of the unimpacted and impacted conditions at this location than at <b>Creeses</b> Mistake, where, under unimpacted conditions, the sediments had a very low organic content. In addition, the background fauna at Stringers Cove contained several species with reproductive strategies suited to rapid recruitment and well adapted for early recolonisation in organically enriched sediments. In contrast, the background fauna at <b>Creeses</b> Mistake not only changed more with the impacts of organic enrichment, but was less able to re-establish populations directly by immigration, needing to rely to a greater extent on remediation of the sediments by transitional species before being able to colonise. This has important implications for environmental management, as it suggests that the sediments in some areas have greater resilience to organic inputs...|$|R

25|$|In 1949 <b>Creese</b> joined Dorset, {{playing for}} the county in the Minor Counties Championship from 1949 to 1950, with all four of his {{fixtures}} for Dorset coming against Berkshire.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to playing first-class matches for Hampshire, <b>Creese</b> also represented the Players in the 1935 Gentlemen v Players fixture and represented the Combined Services in two matches after the war, coming against Oxford University and Surrey in 1946.|$|E
25|$|Modernist {{architecture}} {{was initially}} controversial in the United States, as it represented a stark stylistic departure from older collegiate styles. Hunter College {{was one of}} the first campuses to incorporate Modernist design, for which it received praise. Debate over the relative merit of Modern architecture over past forms included sparring between Walter Gropius, a premiere Modernist, and Walter <b>Creese</b> in the editorial section of the New York Times. Gropius was later employed by Harvard, and designed several buildings for the school.|$|E
60|$|An eminent scientist, Doctor Montano, sent on {{a mission}} to the Philippines by the French government, {{describes}} the entry of eleven juramentados into Tianggi. Divided into three or four bands, they managed to get through the gates of the town bending under loads of fodder for cattle which they pretended to have for sale, and in which they had hidden their <b>creeses.</b> Quick as lightning they stabbed the guards, then, in their frenzied course, they struck all whom they met.|$|R

Hauberks and helms, blunderbusses, Cromwellian breastplates, matchlocks, <b>creeses,</b> and the swords and daggers of an army of dead-and-gone gallants gleam dully in the ghostly light. Here and there from a corner saloon (lit with Jack-o'-lanterns or phosphorus), stagger forth shuddering, home-bound citizens, nerved by the tankards within to their fearsome journey adown that eldrich avenue lined with the bloodstained weapons of the {{fighting}} dead. What street could live inclosed by these mortuary relics, and trod by these spectral citizens in whose sunken hearts scarce one good whoop or tra-la-la remained? ...|$|R
50|$|The {{administration}} of Drexel became more institutionalized, with succinct departments and new administrative offices. The Dean of Faculty became more responsible for daily operations {{than in previous}} decades. There was also {{an increase in the}} number of departments and committees in the academic and administrative offices of the college. An Office of Admissions led by George Galphin opened in 1954. Drexel highlighted cooperative education as a strong incentive for students in the 1950s. The Middle States Association and the Engineering Council for Professional Development made accreditation visits to Drexel in 1953 and 1962, respectively. There were also two major fundraising campaigns, one in 1947 and the other near the end of <b>Creese's</b> tenure in 1962. There was a huge program for development during his tenure due to the concentration on new academic buildings for the school.|$|R
25|$|Kent captain Percy Chapman, {{a family}} friend of Hill's, {{presented}} him with his County Cap in 1935. Hill was accidentally shot in the leg by teammate Len <b>Creese,</b> while bowling in the nets. The bullet stayed in Hill's leg {{for the remainder of}} his life. Hill fought in the Second World War in Italy and resumed his first class career with Hampshire after the resumption of the County Championship in 1946. Hill retired from first-class cricket in 1954. Hill batted in all 11 positions for Hampshire scoring four centuries, including a highest score of 161 against Sussex at Portsmouth.|$|E

60|$|Between the Malay <b>creese</b> and the Castilian carronade the {{struggle}} was unequal, {{but it did}} not last the less long on that account, nor, obscure though it was, was it the less bloody. On both sides there was the same bravery, the same cruelty. It required all the tenacity of Spain to purge these seas of the pirates who infested them, and it was not until after a conflict of several years, in 1876, that the Spanish squadron was able to bring its broadside to bear on Tianggi, that nest of the Suluan pirates, land a division of troops, invest all the outlets, and burn up the town and its inhabitants as well as its harbour and all the craft within it. The soldiers planted their flag and the engineers built a new city on the smoking ruins. This city is protected by a strong garrison. For a time, at least, it was all over with piracy, but not with Moslem fanaticism, which was exasperated rather than crushed by its defeat. To the rovers of the seas succeeded the organisation known as juramentados.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{now a new}} object took {{possession}} of my soul. I spoke a few hurried but energetic words to my companions, and, having succeeded in gaining over {{a few of them}} to my purpose made a frantic sally from the kiosk. We rushed amid the crowd that surrounded it. They retreated, at first, before us. They rallied, fought madly, and retreated again. In the mean time we were borne far from the kiosk, and became bewildered and entangled among the narrow streets of tall, overhanging houses, into the recesses of which the sun {{had never been able to}} shine. The rabble pressed impetuously upon us, harrassing us with their spears, and overwhelming us with flights of arrows. These latter were very remarkable, and resembled in some respects the writhing <b>creese</b> of the Malay. They were made to imitate the body of a creeping serpent, and were long and black, with a poisoned barb. One of them struck me upon the right temple. I reeled and fell. An instantaneous and dreadful sickness seized me. I struggled--I gasped--I died." [...] "You will hardly persist now," [...] said I smiling, [...] "that the whole of your adventure was not a dream.

6000|$|... "When on {{parade and}} in full uniform {{we made a}} {{singular}} and noble appearance. I was always fond of dress; and, in this instance gave a carte blanche to my taste, and invented the most splendid costume that ever perhaps decorated a soldier. I am, as I have stated already, six feet four inches in height, and of matchless symmetry and proportion. My hair and beard are of the most brilliant auburn, so bright as scarcely to be distinguished {{at a distance from}} scarlet. My eyes are bright blue, overshadowed by bushy eyebrows of the colour of my hair, and a terrific gash of the deepest purple, which goes over the forehead, the eyelid, and the cheek, and finishes at the ear, gives my face a more strictly military appearance than can be conceived. When I have been drinking (as is pretty often the case) this gash becomes ruby bright, and as I have another which took off a piece of my under- lip, and shows five of my front teeth, I leave you to imagine that 'seldom lighted on the earth' (as the monster Burke remarked of one of his unhappy victims) 'a more extraordinary vision.' I improved these natural advantages; and, while in cantonment during the hot winds at Chittybobbary, allowed my hair to grow very long, as did my beard, which reached to my waist. It took me two hours daily to curl my hair in ten thousand little corkscrew ringlets, which waved over my shoulders, and to get my moustaches well round to the corners of my eyelids. I dressed in loose scarlet trousers and red morocco boots, a scarlet jacket, and a shawl of the same colour round my waist; a scarlet turban three feet high, and decorated with a tuft of the scarlet feathers of the flamingo, formed my head-dress, and I did not allow myself a single ornament, except a small silver skull and cross-bones in front of my turban. Two brace of pistols, a Malay <b>creese,</b> and a tulwar, sharp on both sides, and very nearly six feet in length, completed this elegant costume. My two flags were each surmounted with a real skull and cross-bones, and ornamented one with a black, and the other with a red beard (of enormous length, taken from men slain in battle by me). On one flag were of course the arms of John Company; on the other, an image of myself bestriding a prostrate elephant, with the simple word 'GUJPUTI' written underneath in the Nagaree, Persian, and Sanscrit characters. I rode my black horse, and looked, by the immortal gods, like Mars. To me might be applied the words which were written concerning handsome General Webb, in Marlborough's time:- ...|$|E
