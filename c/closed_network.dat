25|$|It was {{suggested}} that the problem with building and maintaining larger, more complex, and more accurately replicated molecules can be circumvented if several information carriers, each of them storing {{a small piece of}} information, are connected such that they only control their own concentration. Studies of the mathematical model describing replicating molecules revealed that to observe a cooperative behaviour among self-replicating molecules, they have to be connected by a positive feedback loop of catalytic actions. This kind of <b>closed</b> <b>network</b> consisting of self-replicating entities connected by a catalytic positive-feedback loop was named an elementary hypercycle. Such a concept, apart from an increased information capacity, has another advantage. Linking self-replication with mutual catalysis can produce nonlinear growth of the system. This, first, makes the system resistant to so-called parasitic branches. Parasitic branches are species coupled to a cycle that do not provide any advantage to the reproduction of a cycle, which, in turn, makes them useless and decreases the selective value of the system. Secondly, it reinforces the self-organization of molecules into the hypercycle, allowing the system to evolve without losing information, which solves the error threshold problem.|$|E

Because of rapid development and deployment of advanced networking technologies, various social activities have been shifting onto a network, thus necessitating a technology for providing <b>closed</b> <b>networks</b> for real/virtual groups. In particular, interconnection of multiple <b>closed</b> <b>networks</b> {{is the key}} for realizing those social activities on a network. In this paper, we therefore propose an application-level gateway called application concentrator, which enables interconnection of multiple <b>closed</b> <b>networks</b> for various types of application protocols. In the application concentrator, interconnection of multiple <b>closed</b> <b>networks</b> is realized by multiplexing/demultiplexing the content of communications. For demonstrating effectiveness of the application concentrator, we design example implementations of the application concentrator for three typical applications such as Web, e-mail, and remote desktop...|$|R

In the cases of networks of multiple server queues or of single server queues with equal traffic intensities, the computation involved in proposed approach is much simpler than that in Gordon's paper.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} {{parametric}} class of myopic scheduling and routing policies for open and closed multiclass queueing net-works. In open networks, they steer {{the state of}} the system to-ward a predetermined and fixed target, while, in <b>closed</b> <b>networks</b> they steer instantaneous throughputs toward a fixed target. In both cases, the proposed policies measure distance from the target using a weighted norm. In open networks, we establish that for an L 2 norm the corresponding policies are stable. In <b>closed</b> <b>networks,</b> we establish that with proper target selection the corresponding policy is efficient, that is, attains bottleneck throughput in the in-finite population limit. In both open and <b>closed</b> <b>networks,</b> the pro-posed policies are amenable to distributed implementation using local state information. We exploit the work in a previous paper to select appropriate parameter values and outline how optimal parameter values can be computed. We report numerical results indicating that we obtain near-optimal policies (when the optimal can be computed) and significantly outperform heuristic alterna-tives.

40|$|One of {{the successes}} of the Brownian {{approximation}} approach to dynamic control of queueing networks is {{the design of a}} control policy for <b>closed</b> <b>networks</b> with two servers by Harrison and Wein. Adopting a Brownian approximation with only heuristic justification, they interpret the optimal control policy for the Brownian model as a static priority rule, and conjecture that this priority rule is asymptotically optimal as the <b>closed</b> <b>network's</b> population becomes large. This paper studies <b>closed</b> queueing <b>networks</b> with two servers that are balanced, i. e., networks that have the same relative load factor at each server. The validity of the Brownian approximation used by Harrison and Wein is established by showing that, under the policy they propose, the diffusion-scaled workload imbalance process converges weakly in the infinite population limit to the diffusion predicted by the Brownian approximation. This is accomplished by proving that the fluid limits of the queue length processes undergo state [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Analytic {{queueing}} network {{models are}} being used to analyze various optimization problems such as server allocation, design and capacity issues, optimal routing, and workload allocation. The mathematical properties of the relevant performance measures, such as throughput, are important for optimization purposes and for insight into system performance. We show that for <b>closed</b> queueing <b>networks</b> of m arbitrarily connected single server queues with n customers, throughput, as a function of a scaled, constrained workload, is not concave. In fact, the function appears to be strictly quasiconcave. There is a constraint on the total workload that must be allocated among the servers in the <b>network.</b> However, for <b>closed</b> <b>networks</b> of two single server queues, we prove that our scaled throughput is concave when there are two customers in the network and strictly quasi-concave when there are more than two customers. The mathematical properties of both the scaled throughput and reciprocal throughput are demonstrated graphically for <b>closed</b> <b>networks</b> of two and three single server queues...|$|R
