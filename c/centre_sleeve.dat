40|$|Wedding dress {{comprising}} long full skirt, shorter at {{front and}} long full-sleeved bodice. Made {{of silver and}} grey striped silk, the bodice is pleated from shoulders to form a deep 'V' neck (possibly had a lace insert for modesty) and has hooks and eyes to secure at back. Bodice falls to a smocked and boned point at <b>centre</b> front. <b>Sleeves</b> are tight at underarms with top stitched pleats, falling to wide angel sleeves at wrist (possibly had lace inner sleeves). Sleeves are lined with cream silk with ruffles around inside of wrists. Bodice is lined with calico and has a row of hooks and eyes to right hand side [...] Date: 1870 (circa) - from the The Betty Smithers Design Collection at Staffordshire University. ...|$|R
50|$|When {{steering}} effort is applied {{at the wheel}} it is transmitted to the rotor, which transmits the effort to the hour glass cam {{by means of the}} torsion bar. The rotor is normally <b>centred</b> in its <b>sleeve</b> by the torsion bar but manual {{steering effort}} twists the torsion bar, permitting the rotor to turn within its sleeve, opening the way for hydraulic fluid pressure to be applied to one or other side of the servo piston, thus assisting in turning the front wheels.|$|R
50|$|The wholetime {{cadre of}} ROC {{officers}} remained in post and the ROC centres across the UK were maintained {{and kept in}} good condition. Humorous cartoons of the era depicted the wholetime officers tending flower beds {{in front of the}} ROC <b>centres</b> with uniform <b>sleeves</b> rolled up, sunning themselves in deck-chairs or sleepily answering the front door in nightgown and nightcap with a candle in their hand. Although no longer being paid, many observers continued to meet and train weekly in private and membership of the unofficial Royal Observer Corps Club expanded.|$|R

The start-up phase of the trial (December, 2008, to March, 2010) {{was funded by the}} Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government (reference CZH/ 4 / 417). The main phase of the trial was funded by the NIHR HTA Programme (reference 08 / 14 / 03). Covidien lent its Kendall Express Sequential Compression System Controllers to our 105 centres and donated supplies of their sleeves. It also provided logistical help in keeping our <b>centres</b> supplied with <b>sleeves</b> and training materials relevant to the use of their devices. Recruitment and follow-up was supported by the NIHR funded UK Stroke research network and the Scottish Stroke Research network, which was supported by NHS Research Scotland.

30|$|Our {{study is}} {{free from the}} {{constraints}} of commercially available systems, but our equations and tables {{can be used to}} estimate errors generated by these systems when certain parameters are known. Our study calculates the maximum errors expected by the mechanical components of the computerised implant surgery process, with the understanding that the implantologist involved in the in-office printing has to have a knowledge of the dimensions, the design and the tolerances of the components he will use for the manufacturing of the guide. Cassetta et al. [13] estimated that 62.7 % of the total implant positioning error was due to the properties of the sleeve/ drill combination, when the Materialise Safe® guide system was used. Even though it is recommended that the osteotomy should be performed without exerting force to the guide [12] and with the bur led parallel to the long axis of the sleeve, this is not possible in a number of cases, especially where the mouth opening is a limiting factor or when an oblique bone ridge is encountered. It is, therefore, probable that during surgery, the drill is tilted inside the sleeve, changing the final position of the implant. Then the metallic components with their dimensions and tolerances define the maximum permissible errors. Obviously, if the drill rotates exactly at the <b>centre</b> of the <b>sleeve,</b> no error is expected. It should be noted that when a sleeve/key/drill combination is used, the expected errors of the mechanical parts should be estimated taking into account the bigger clearance value created by the key usage. To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensibly calculate the errors by taking into consideration the parameters that contribute to the 62.7 % of the total error in guided implant surgery, as Cassetta et al. [13] stated.|$|R
