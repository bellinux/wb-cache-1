The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate (a) genetic gain for seed yield in the cycle 1 (C 1), cycle 2 (C 2), and cycle 3 (C 3) of AP 10 to AP 14 and (b) the mean seed yield and genetic variability in C 1, C 2, C 3, and <b>cycle</b> <b>4</b> (<b>C</b> 4) of the five populations. There was a significant linear increase in seed yield in all populations across the three cycles. The gain in selection for seed yield was 153 kg ha- 1 cycle- 1 for AP 14, 80 for AP 13, 85 for AP 12, 54 for AP 11, and 66 for AP 10. Although AP 14 was reported to have the lowest genetic variability in the cycle 0 population, it exhibited the greatest genetic gain per cycle during the three cycles of selection. The highest yielding line in each cycle was also from AP 14. The results indicated that PIs did not enhance the response to recurrent selection for seed yield compared with populations developed from only high-yielding cultivars and experimental lines;When genetic variances for the five populations were compared {{in each of the four}} cycles of selection, the genetic variance estimates for AP 14 were lower than that of AP 11 and AP 13 in C 1 and C 4, but were not different from that of the other populations in C 2 and C 3.

40|$|Plant {{introductions}} (PIs) {{may increase}} the genetic variability of soybean populations and lead to greater genetic gains from selection. Five soybean populations containing different percentages of PI parentage were developed at Iowa State University {{to evaluate the use}} of PIs for increasing genetic variability for seed yield in a recurrent selection program. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the performance and genetic variability of the <b>Cycle</b> <b>4</b> (<b>C</b> 4) populations of AP 10 (100 % PI), AP 11 (75 % PI), AP 12 (50 % PI), AP 13 (25 % PI), and AP 14 (0 % PI) for agronomic traits and seed composition. Multiplexing technology for simple sequence repeats (SSRs) was developed to facilitate the molecular diversity analysis of the elite and PI parents of AP 10 to AP 14. The mean performance of the C 4 populations for seed yield was inversely proportional to the percentage of PI parentage that was initially present in CO. Genetic variance estimates for seed yield were similar among populations, indicating that the PIs did not provide greater genetic variability when recurrent selection was conducted for four cycles. AP 10 to AP 13 had higher means and more genetic variability for seed weight and, in particular, protein content, suggesting PIs may be valuable for the simultaneous improvement of yield and protein in a recurrent selection program. Eleven multiplex sets comprising 74 SSR markers were developed to analyze the molecular diversity of the PI and elite parents of AP 10 to AP 14. Results from the analysis showed greater diversity and less genetic similarity among the PIs than among the elite genotypes. The least amount of genetic similarity was between the PIs and elite genotypes. The ability of SSRs to distinguish among elite soybean genotypes and PIs with agronomic merit may facilitate the transfer of favorable alleles from PIs into elite populations...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{improvement}} for yield in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] {{has been}} accomplished by breeding within a narrow elite gene pool. Plant introductions (PIs) may be useful for obtaining additional increases in yield if unique and desirable alleles at quantitative trait loci (QTL) can be identified. The objectives {{of the study were}} to identify QTL for yield in elite and PI germplasm and to determine if the PIs possessed favorable alleles for yield. Allele frequencies were measured with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in three populations that differed in their percentage of PI parentage. AP 10 had 40 PI parents, AP 12 had 40 PI and 40 elite parents, and AP 14 had 40 elite parents. Four cycles of recurrent selection for yield had been conducted in the three populations. Nei 2 ̆ 7 s genetic distance indicated that AP 10, AP 12, and AP 14 remained distinct through <b>cycle</b> <b>4</b> (<b>C</b> 4), but that the genetic diversity narrowed within each population. Less gametic phase disequilibrium (GPD) was observed in the parents used to form the cycle 0 (CO) populations than in C 4 of AP 12 and AP 14. Allele frequencies of the highest-yielding C 4 lines in the three populations were compared with the parents used to form the populations of the initial cycles. Allele flow was simulated to account for genetic drift. Ninety-two SSRs were associated with 56 yield QTL. Nine of the QTL had been identified in previous research. Thirty-three favorable marker alleles were unique to the PI parents. The restriction of alleles from the 40 CO parents to the 20 cycle 1 (C 1) parents of AP 10 was reflected in the number of alleles that had frequency changes and could explain the reduced genetic variance for yield in the C 4 of AP 10. Genetic asymmetry may account for the different genetic gain for yield that had been observed between AP 10 and AP 14...|$|E

We {{systematically}} investigated {{perfect state}} transfer between antipodal nodes of discrete time quantum walks on variants of the <b>cycles</b> <b>C</b> <b>4,</b> <b>C</b> 6 and C 8 for three choices of coin operator.

These dynamics are either periodicity, perfect state trans-fer, or very high fidelity state transfer. These families are modifications of families known not to exhibit periodicity or perfect state transfer in general. The robustness of the dynamics is tested by varying the initial state, interpolating between structures and by adding decoherence. ...|$|R

RbcS also showed elevated abundance in etiolated cotyledons, although this rapidly declined after illumination. The remainder of the <b>C</b> <b>4</b> genes profiled accumulated in etiolated tissue, but were upregulated within 6 hours of illumination. Therefore, this study has illustrated that miRNA activity {{may play a role in}} maintaining the <b>C</b> <b>4</b> photosynthetic <b>cycle</b> at optimum efficiency, although it has not been possible to identify at which point(s) this regulation is applied. Secondly, RbcS appears to be subject to multiple regulatory mechanisms in C. gynandra, and it is possible that miRNAs have a role in negatively regulating expression of RbcS. BBSR...|$|R

40|$|The {{transport}} of the tricarboxylic acid <b>cycle</b> <b>C</b> <b>4</b> -dicarboxylic acids was studied {{in both the}} wild-type strain and tricarboxylic acid cycle mutants of Bacillus subtilis. Active {{transport of}} malate, fumarate, and succinate {{was found to be}} inducible by these dicarboxylic acids or by precursors to them, whereas glucose or closely related metabolites catabolite-repressed their uptake. l-Malate was found to be the best dicarboxylic acid transport inducer in succinic dehydrogenase, fumarase, and malic dehydrogenase mutants. Succinate and fumarate are accumulated over 100 -fold in succinic dehydrogenase and fumarase mutants, respectively, whereas mutants lacking malate dehydrogenase were unable to accumulate significant quantities of the <b>C</b> <b>4</b> -dicarboxylic acids. The stereospecificity of this transport system was studied from a comparison of the rates of competitive inhibition of both succinate uptake and efflux in a succinate dehydrogenase mutant by utilizing thirty dicarboxylic acid analogues. The system was specific for the <b>C</b> <b>4</b> -dicarboxylic acids of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, neither citrate nor α-ketoglutarate were effective competitive inhibitors. Of a wide variety of metabolic inhibitors tested, inhibiors of oxidative phosphorylation and of the formation of proton gradients were the most potent inhibitors of transport. From the kinetics of dicarboxylic acid transport (Km approximately 10 − 4 M for succinate or fumarate in succinic acid dehydrogenase and fumarase mutants) and from the competitive inhibition studies, it was concluded that an inducible dicarboxylic acid transport system mediates the entry of malate, fumarate, or succinate into B. subtilis. Mutants devoid of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase were shown to accumulate both α-ketoglutarate and glutamate, and these metabolites subsequently inhibited the transport of all the <b>C</b> <b>4</b> -dicarboxylic acids, suggesting a regulatory role...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Chloronitrophenols (CNPs) {{are widely}} used in the {{synthesis}} of dyes, drugs and pesticides, and constitute a major group of environmental pollutants. 4 -Chloro- 2 -nitrophenol (<b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP) is an isomer of CNPs that has been detected in various industrial effluents. A number of physicochemical methods {{have been used for}} treatment of wastewater containing <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP. These methods are not as effective as microbial degradation, however. Results A <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP-degrading bacterium, Exiguobacterium sp. PMA, which uses <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP as the sole carbon and energy source was isolated from a chemically-contaminated site in India. Exiguobacterium sp. PMA degraded <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP with the release of stoichiometeric amounts of chloride and ammonium ions. The effects of different substrate concentrations and various inoculum sizes on degradation of <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP were investigated. Exiguobacterium sp. PMA degraded <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP up to a concentration of 0. 6 [*]mM. High performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry identified 4 -chloro- 2 -aminophenol (<b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 AP) and 2 -aminophenol (2 AP) as possible metabolites of the <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP degradation pathway. The crude extract of <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP-induced PMA cells contained enzymatic activity for <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP reductase and <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 AP dehalogenase, suggesting the involvement of these enzymes in the degradation of <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP. Microcosm studies using sterile and non-sterile soils spiked with <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP were carried out to monitor the bioremediation potential of Exiguobacterium sp. PMA. The bioremediation of <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP by Exiguobacterium sp. PMA was faster in non-sterilized soil than sterilized soil. Conclusions Our studies indicate that Exiguobacterium sp. PMA may be useful for the bioremediation of <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 NP-contaminated sites.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of multiple pathways {{of carbon dioxide}} assimilation and dissimilation in higher plants has drastically changed the research and thinking in plant biology. The theme is developed that adaptations within photosynthesis are of fundamental importance in plants and that changes in this dominant metabolic process arc apt to result in strong and immediate selection advantages {{in the course of}} plant evolution. Data are presented on the variations in photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation in the reductive pentose phosphate <b>cycle,</b> the <b>C</b> <b>4</b> -dicarboxylic acid <b>cycle,</b> and in Crassulacean acid metabolism. Photo-synthetic studies with primitive plants such as P silo turn nudum indicate a metabolism similar to Cj-dicarboxylic acid may have arisen in this primitive plant. In order to establish a perspective on the metabolic processes in plants which might be subject to adaptation, we have considered the activities of major meta-bolic processes such as photosynthesis, photorespiration, dark respiration, transpira-tion, nitrogen fixation, ion uptake, and the synthesis of proteins, lipids, cell walls. Many of these metabolic activities are common to all of life forms and probabl...|$|R
40|$|Yield {{levels in}} rice as {{improved}} by {{direct and indirect}} manipulation of yield and its components by conventional plant breeding have reached a plateau. Since photosynthesis is the least targeted trait for yield enhancement, {{it can be a}} potential area for application of biotechnology to harness better yields through genetic manipulation. The key areas of research are plant architecture, duration of photosynthesis, manipulation of PS-I and PS-II, manipulation of Rubisco and driving a <b>C</b> <b>4</b> <b>cycle</b> in rice. With the advancement in biotechnology and plant molecular biology, genetic manipulation of these traits especially increasing the efficiency of Rubisco and over expression of <b>C</b> <b>4</b> genes in rice have witnessed significant achievements in terms of research and application. The selective advantage of <b>C</b> <b>4</b> <b>cycle</b> such as high photosynthetic efficiency, high water and nitrogen use efficiency especially under low CO 2 levels offers a tremendous opportunity for crop modification. Despite obvious limitations with regard to replicating the <b>C</b> <b>4</b> <b>cycle</b> in a <b>C</b> 3 plant, rice, which needs gross anatomical changes, the option of engineering <b>C</b> <b>4</b> enzymes into rice is really workable.

40|$|The CO 2 {{dependence}} of rates of CO 2 fixation (A) and photochemistry of PS II at 5, 15 and 30 % O 2 were analyzed in the <b>C</b> <b>4</b> plant Amaranthus edulis having a <b>C</b> <b>4</b> <b>cycle</b> deficiency [phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) mutants], {{and in the}} <b>C</b> <b>4</b> plant Flaveria bidentis having a C 3 cycle deficiency [Rubisco small subunit antisense (SSU) ]. In the wild type (WT) A. edulis and its heterozygous mutant having less than 50 % WT PEPC activity there was a similar {{dependence of}} A and PS II photochemistry on varying CO 2, although the CO 2 saturated rates were 25 % lower in heterozygous plants. The homozygous plants having less than 2 % PEPC of the WT had significant levels of photorespiration at ambient levels of CO 2 and required about 30 times ambient levels for maximum rates of A. Despite variation in {{the capacity of the}} <b>C</b> <b>4</b> <b>cycle,</b> more than 91 % of PS II activity was linearly associated with A under varying CO 2 at 5, 15 and 30 % O 2. However, the WT plant had a higher PS II activity per CO 2 fixed under saturating CO 2 than the homozygous mutant, which is suggested to be due to elimination of the <b>C</b> <b>4</b> <b>cycle</b> and its associated requirement for ATP from a Mehler reaction. In the SSU F. bidentis plants, a decreased rate of A (35 %) and PS II activity (33 %) accompanied a decrease in Rubisco capacity. There was some increase in alternative electron sinks at high CO 2 when the C 3 cycle was constrained, which may be due to increased flux through the <b>C</b> <b>4</b> <b>cycle</b> via an ATP generating Mehler reaction. Nevertheless, even with constraints on the function of the <b>C</b> <b>4</b> or <b>C</b> 3 <b>cycle</b> by genetic modifications, analyses of CO 2 response curves under varying levels of O 2 indicate that CO 2 assimilation is the main determinant of PS II activity in <b>C</b> <b>4</b> plants...|$|R
40|$|For {{functional}} {{studies of}} the integrin alpha 4 cytoplasmic domain, we have expressed the following in K 562 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells: 1) wild-type alpha 4 (called X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> <b>4),</b> 2) two chimeric forms of alpha 4 (called X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 and X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 5) that contain the cytoplasmic domains of alpha 2 and alpha 5, respectively, and 3) alpha 4 with no cytoplasmic domain (X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 0). Cytoplasmic domain exchange {{had no effect on}} VLA- 4 -dependent static cell adhesion or tethering to VCAM- 1 in conditions of shear flow. However, the presence of the alpha 2 or alpha 5 tails markedly enhanced VLA- 4 -dependent K 562 cells spreading (X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 > X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 5 > X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> <b>4</b> > X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 0), increased localization of VLA- 4 into focal adhesion-like complexes in CHO cells (X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 > X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 5 > X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> <b>4),</b> and strengthened CHO and K 562 cell resistance to detachment from VCAM- 1 in conditions of shear flow (X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 2 > X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 5 > X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> <b>4</b> > X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 0). Conversely, the alpha 4 tail supported greater VLA- 4 -dependent haptotactic and chemotactic cell migration. In the absence of any alpha tail (i. e., X <b>4</b> <b>C</b> 0), robust focal adhesions were observed, even though cell spreading and adhesion strengthening were minimal. Thus, such focal adhesions may have relatively little functional importance, and should not be compared with focal adhesions formed when alpha tails are present. Together, these results indicate that all three alpha-chain tails exert defined positive effects (compared with no tail at all), but suggest that the alpha 4 cytoplasmic domain may be specialized to engage in weaker cytoskeletal interactions, leading to diminished focal adhesion formation, cell spreading, and adhesion strengthening, while augmenting cell migration and facilitating rolling under shear flow. These properties of the alpha 4 tail are consistent with the role of alpha 4 integrins on highly motile lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils...|$|R
