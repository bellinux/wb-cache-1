40|$|<b>Commemorations</b> {{of shared}} {{national}} history {{are important to}} the process of nationbuilding. Support for such national <b>commemorations</b> is not, however, evenly distributed in societies. Because this could endanger the possible integrative function of commemorative ceremonies, {{it is important to understand}} the sources of structural differences in support. In this article, age differences in support for national <b>commemorations</b> in the Netherlands are examined. It is argued that because age cohorts grow up with different ideas on what should be commemorated they also differ in value attached to such <b>commemorations.</b> Data from the National Freedom Enquiry 2012 show that older persons more often associate national <b>commemorations</b> with the Second World War than younger persons do, and that this is the reason why they are more supportive of the annual celebration of Liberation Day. In the concluding section, it is argued that more (quantitative) studies should be conducted in order to truly understand the mechanisms behind support of national <b>commemorations</b> as this may help us to better comprehend the processes construing feelings of national belonging...|$|R

5|$|Commemorations are for {{individuals}} or events {{which have been}} noteworthy {{in the life of}} the Church and in the history of Lutheranism in particular. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, and if there is a conflict between a <b>commemoration</b> and a festival of any other rank, the <b>commemoration</b> is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a <b>commemoration</b> falls on a Sunday where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer of the day or in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell on a Sunday and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer of the day or the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in the prayers of the faithful in addition to recitation of the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way.|$|E
