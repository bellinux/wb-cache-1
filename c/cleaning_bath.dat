40|$|Substantial {{potential}} energy savings exist for many parts washing and cleaning processes in use today. Energy usage is frequently {{the largest single}} variable cost involved in parts washing and cleaning operations. Several control parameters such as Dynamic Surface Tension, pH, Conductivity, Temperature, Turbidity and Water Softener Pretreatment can be combined using currently available sensors, data acquisition systems and process control technology to maximize production efficiency while minimizing operating process temperatures, product rejects and related operating costs. Most parts washing systems are operated at elevated temperatures to ensure that used cleaning solutions continue to clean parts {{as long as possible}} between cleaning solution bath dumps. This is based on the theory that higher temperatures will reduce the viscosity or liquefy greases to speed the removal process. This strategy can be counter productive. Operating at elevated temperatures increases water evaporation and results in substantial energy losses. Increased make up water required to replace water lost to evaporation also results in increased magnesium and calcium salts building up in the <b>cleaning</b> <b>bath.</b> Surfactants that are tied up with calcium and magnesium salts are not available to help clean processed parts. This shortens the <b>cleaning</b> <b>bath</b> life unless soft water or DI water is used for make up water additions. Excess calcium and magnesium salts precipitate to form calcium and magnesium carbonate and sulfate heater tube scaling and substantially reduces heat transfer efficiency. These costs can all be substantially reduced by lowering <b>cleaning</b> <b>bath</b> operating temperatures. Good process control data collection combined with new online process control system capabilities now allow operators to lower operating bath temperatures and replace high temperature QA/QC (Quality Assurance/ Quality Control) cleaning safety factors with real process control of <b>cleaning</b> <b>bath</b> chemistry.

30|$|For luting lithium {{disilicate}} ceramic, {{the surface}} treatment is etching with hydrofluoric acid (HF), which generates microporosities {{because of the}} glass phase and silica oxide dissolution. This treatment produces topographical changes, which increases the micromechanical retention and chemical bond with the silane and resin cements, reflecting on the values of bond strength between the ceramic and cement [3]. The lithium disilicate ceramic must be etching with HF, with an application of silane prior to cementation, but the etching generates acid precipitates that may affect the bond between ceramic and cement [4].

40|$|New {{approaches}} for future photovoltaic cell concepts issue {{a challenge to}} crystalline wafer handling. Especially concepts based on ultra-thin silicon wafers force automation developers to look even beyond {{the aims of the}} international PV manufacturing roadmap. As widely known, crystalline photovoltaic wafers are a very sensitive object for industrial production, especially for gripper-based handling solutions. The known wafering method "SLliM-cut" requires an additional cleaning step after a single wafer was detached from the parent substrate. To clean organic residues off substrates an etching bath is applied.

These hearing losses were already evident in subjects with exposure of less than 10 years and increased with years of exposure and advancing age.
