40|$|Major element {{chemistry}} of basalt {{from the southern}} East Pacific Rise (EPR) {{is different from that}} of the EPR at the time of the formation of the Pacific Plate at 170 Ma. Glass recovered from Jurassic age (170 Ma) Pacific ocean crust (Bartolini and Larson, 2001, doi: 10. 1130 / 0091 - 7613 (2001) 029 2. 0. CO; 2) at Ocean Drilling Program Hole 801 C records higher Fe 8 (10. 77 wt%) and marginally lower Na 8 (2. 21 wt%) compared to the modern EPR, suggesting deeper melting and a temperature of initial melting that was 60 Â°C hotter than today. Trace element ratios such as La/Sm and Zr/Y, on the other hand, show remarkable similarities to the modern southern EPR, indicating that Site 801 was not generated on a hotspot-influenced ridge and that mantle composition has changed little in the Pacific over the past 170 Ma. Our results are consistent with the observation that mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) older than 80 Ma were derived by higher temperature melting than are modern MORBs (Humler et al., 1999, doi: 10. 1016 /S 0012 - 821 X(99) 00218 - 6), which may have been a consequence of the <b>Cretaceous</b> <b>superplume</b> event in the Pacific. Site 801 predates the formation of Pacific oceanic plateaus and 801 C basalt chemistry indicates that higher temperatures of mantle melting beneath Pacific ridges preceded the initiation of the superplume...|$|E
