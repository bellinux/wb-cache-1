The <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> can be a sensitive indicator of separate SEP populations. Several examples of <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> measurements in SEP events will be presented. Two events consist of magnetic clouds, in which <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> observations provide information about the cloud geometry and source region. Other events are characterized by energy dependent <b>charge</b> <b>states,</b> in which higher energy ions have higher <b>charge</b> <b>states.</b> These may be caused by at least three mechanisms: shock acceleration in the corona together with collisions, rigidity dependent acceleration from an interplanetary shock, or finally interplanetary shock acceleration operating on a mixture of coronal material and preaccelerated flare ions. A multiple event study has compared iron <b>charge</b> <b>states,</b> ranging from = 10 + to 20 +, to those of C, O, Ne, Mg and Si. The mean <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> of these ions all increased as the iron <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> increased.

In conjunction with the particle mass this measurement is a tool to study acceleration, fractionation, and transport processes. SEPICA {{has been designed to}} resolve <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> distributions in detail and to provide a large collecting power, which allows a much more detailed analysis. During November 4 - 7, 1997, a series of strong flares occurred that were magnetically well-connected. Over the energy range approximate to 0. 2 - 1 MeV/nucleon a substantial increase of the <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> with energy was observed. Fe shows a <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> distribution with a distinct peak at Q approximate to 10 - 15 and a tail extending to Q approximate to 20. The newly revealed variation of the <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> with energy will potentially provide insight into modification of <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> during or after acceleration due to stripping and/or rigidity dependent acceleration processes. In addition, a sample of solar particle (SEP) events in 1998, the first year of significant solar activity during the rise of the current solar cycle, is studied for their <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> variations.

We investigated changes in the positive-mode ESI <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> distribution produced by several chemical modifications of denatured proteins. Capping carboxylic acid groups with neutral functional groups yields little change in <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> distribution compared with unmodified proteins. The results indicate that carboxyl groups do not {{play a significant role}} in the positive charging of denatured proteins in ESI. The modification of proteins with additional basic sites or fixed positive charges generates substantially higher <b>charge</b> <b>states,</b> providing evidence that the number of ionizable sites, rather than molecular size and shape, determines ESI charging for denatured proteins. Fixed charge modification also significantly reduces the number of protons acquired by a protein, in that the <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> envelope is not increased by the full number of fixed charges appended. This result demonstrates that Coulombic repulsion between positive charges plays a significant role in determining <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> distribution by affecting the gas-phase basicity of ionizable sites.

We also present <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> measurements for the January 20, 2005 event, which contrasts with the previously demonstrated Q(Fe) vs. Fe/O correlation. In this event solar and SEP data indicate that the first high-energy particles left the sun when the shock was ~ 1. 5 solar radii above the solar surface. At this altitude charge-equilibration calculations and the observed mean <b>charge</b> <b>states</b> of + 12 for Fe imply that < 90 seconds were available to accelerate and release the particles. These observations therefore present a serious challenge to SEP acceleration models...|$|R
