The <b>certification</b> <b>aircraft,</b> a de-rated A340-541 model, became the first delivery, to Thai Airways International, on 11 April 2007. Nigerian airline Arik Air received a pair of A340-542s in November 2008, using the type to immediately launch two new routes, Lagos-London Heathrow and Lagos-Johannesburg; a non-stop Lagos-New York route began in January 2010. The A340-500IGW is powered by four 250 kN thrust Rolls-Royce Trent 556 turbofans.|$|E
