40|$|AbstractThe {{distribution}} of equivalent strains was studied {{to realize the}} overall grain refinement along the thickness direction of the cylindrical parts manufactured by spin-forming. The metal flow model during <b>counter-roller</b> spinning was established and the calculation formula of equivalent strains of the spun parts was derived based on upper bound method. The {{results show that the}} equivalent strains {{distribution of}} the spun parts obtained by <b>counter-roller</b> spinning is {{different from that of the}} stagger spinning; the equivalent strains decrease firstly and then increase from outer surface to inner surface of the spun parts obtained by <b>counter-roller</b> spinning, and the distribution of equivalent strains of spun part is symmetrical about the middle layer along thickness direction...|$|E
40|$|The high {{dimensional}} accuracy and excellent mechanical properties have become {{two most important}} requirements for structural components. In this paper, experiments using two spinning methods, stagger spinning and <b>counter-roller</b> spinning, were carried out under different thinning ratio of wall thickness of spun parts. The influence of spinning methods and total thinning ratio of wall thickness on the {{dimensional accuracy}} and mechanical properties of the!spun parts were studied. It shows that the wall thickness deviation and ovality of the spun parts {{are closely related to}} the spinning method and the total thinning ratio of wall thickness. The hardness of the spun parts increases with the increasing of the total thinning ratio, and the hardness along the thickness direction of the spun parts manufactured by <b>counter-roller</b> spinning is more homogeneous than that of the stagger spinning. The strength and the elongation of the spun parts are mainly influenced by the total thinning ratio, with little relevance to the spinning method...|$|E
