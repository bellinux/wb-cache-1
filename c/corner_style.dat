50|$|Round {{the corner}} kicking was first {{credited}} to Wilf Wooler in the 1930s. It was later {{practiced in the}} 1940s by Willie Horne, the Barrow, Lancashire, England and Great Britain captain and rugby league player. His distinctive round the <b>corner</b> <b>style</b> of kicking enabled him to kick over 100 goals in the 1945-46 season and then he scored more than 700 goals for his club Barrow before his retirement in 1969. He was known to wear relatively soft-toed boots the heavier boot then general being unnecessary for him, unlike for others using the toe-end style of kicking which was then prevalent in both league and union throughout the world.|$|E
5000|$|Frank Zappa was {{responsible}} for The Persuasions' first LP, Acappella. [...] He heard The Persuasions singing over the phone from a New Jersey record shop known as Stan's Square Records. The store's owner, Stan Krause, was the group's manager at the time. Prior to that time, The Persuasions had recorded several a cappella tracks for Krause's record label, Catamount Records. Zappa had an appreciation for soul and street <b>corner</b> <b>style</b> singing, and after hearing the group, flew them to Los Angeles to record their first album. The Persuasions were the opening act at The Mothers concerts at Carnegie Hall, 1971. Thirty years later, Zappa fan Rip Rense supervised and encouraged the group {{in the creation of}} a Persuasions tribute CD to Zappa, Frankly A Cappella on Earthbeat Records.|$|E

During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where {{he shifted his}} body weight towards {{the inside of a}} turn. Roberts tried the technique and found that it helped settle the motorcycle. He adopted the <b>cornering</b> <b>style</b> and exaggerated the body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it skimmed the track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began to excel in road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|R

50|$|Changing tyre {{technology}} {{continued to}} influence riding style in 2013 in MotoGP, when rider Marc Márquez adjusted the knee-down <b>cornering</b> <b>style</b> begun by Mike Hailwood {{to a more}} extreme knee-and-elbow down turning, with much of his upper body off center. Márquez was working to use to best advantage {{the characteristics of the}} spec Bridgestone tyres all teams had been assigned since 2011, moving off center to keep the bike as upright as possible in the corner apex, and off the relatively flexible edge of tread area. To keep pace, other riders had to learn this physically demanding maneuver, requiring practice to change body position smoothly without upsetting the bike, a properly set up suspension keyed for this style of riding, and targeted muscle development to hold body position.|$|R

50|$|Burlington's First Methodist Church {{stands in}} {{downtown}} Burlington, at {{the southeast corner}} of Buell Street and South Winooski Avenue. It is a large masonry structure, built out of red sandstone with trim from the quarries of Isle La Motte. It is basically rectangular in shape, with a gabled roof and a square tower 147 ft in height at its northwest <b>corner.</b> The <b>styling</b> is basically Gothic, although instead of Gothic lancet windows, most of the windows have a round-arch top, giving the building an overall Romanesque feel. Bays on the sidewalls are articulated by buttresses, as are the corners of the tower, which rises to an square louvered belfry and octagonal steeple. The church is connected at the rear via a connecting addition to its parsonage.|$|R

5000|$|This {{house is}} a typical example of an I-house, which is {{generally}} found in rural settings. [...] Even though this house is within the Davenport city limits, it {{is located in a}} rural area in the city's southwest <b>corner.</b> The I-house <b>style</b> combines elements found in the Greek Revival and Italianate styles. [...] The Greek Revival elements are found in the center doorways, both upstairs and main level, with their sidelights and transoms. The Italianate elements are found primarily in the taller windows on the main floor.|$|R
50|$|In 1602, {{shortly after}} Amor Vincit was completed, Cardinal Benedetto Giustiniani, Vincenzo’s brother and {{collaborator}} {{in the creation}} of the Giustiniani collection of contemporary art, commissioned a painting from the noted artist Giovanni Baglione. Baglione’s Divine and Profane Love showed Divine Love separating a juvenile Cupid on the ground in the lower right corner (profane love) from a Lucifer in the left <b>corner.</b> Its <b>style</b> was thoroughly derivative of Caravaggio (who had recently emerged as a rival for Church commissions) and a clear challenge to the recent Amor, and the younger painter bitterly protested at what he saw as the plagiarism. Taunted by one of Caravaggio’s friends, Baglione responded with a second version, in which the devil was given Caravaggio’s face. Thus began a long and vicious quarrel which was to have unforeseeable ramifications for Caravaggio decades after his death when the unforgiving Baglione became his first biographer.|$|R

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a cross-gable roof and clapboarded exterior. A gable end faces Adams Street, two bays wide, with a projecting single-story bay window in the left bay, its roof eave with small wooden brackets. The main roof has brackets at the <b>corners,</b> and Stick <b>style</b> woodwork in not just the main gable, but in the gables of smaller roof dormers and the projecting side gables.

50|$|Hope Valley {{was mainly}} settled by German emigrants {{escaping}} religious persecution. Holden spoke German and often acted as interpreter. This {{is seen as}} a reason many Germans moved to Hope Valley from Klemzig approximately six kilometres away. In 1847 Hermann Friedrich Koch purchased 8 acre of Section 824 and applied for a licence to open a public house - the Bremen Arms. The Bremen Arms was the venue for much of the settlement's meetings in those early days, but since 1905 has been known simply as The Bremen. The original rough stone building has since been encapsulated by a 1970s plain brick structure, which has been expanded on many occasions. Recent renovations have uncovered a curious art deco <b>style</b> <b>corner</b> complete with a sea green round window. This has since been recovered, and the original stonework arches have been exposed and re-pointed in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|A feud {{that went}} into Victory Road was between A.J. Styles, Matt Hardy and Ric Flair. On the February 17 edition of TNA Impact!, Flair betrayed Styles during his one on one contest with Hardy. Later in the night, Styles, angry, {{challenged}} Flair the next week to a match. The following week, before their match only amounted to a brawl, Flair, now with Immortal, dropped his Fortune leadership to Styles, disrespecting him vocally and physically in the process, igniting full-on retaliation. [...] On the March 10 edition of ‘’TNA Impact!’’, Flair, Hardy and Styles faced off in a three-way Street Fight, which conspicuously turned into a Handicap match, where after a low blow and Twist of Hate, Hardy allowed Flair to gain the pinfall victory over Styles. Later, {{it was announced that}} Hardy, with Flair in his <b>corner,</b> would wrestle <b>Styles</b> at Victory Road.|$|R
40|$|Telescoping Half Slotted Containers (HSC) and Diagonal <b>Corner</b> Bliss <b>style</b> {{containers}} {{are popular}} choices for packaging agricultural {{products such as}} apples, pears, citrus, potatoes, garlic and most vegetables. This study evaluated two unique corrugated container designs, Kisch Full Circle Tray (FCT) and Single V Kisch Bliss, which are both viable designs available to replace the presently used styles of boxes for produce distribution. This paper presents the compression strength results of Telescoping HSC containers as compared to two possible replacements and the Diagonal Corner Bliss designs when stored under standard, refrigerated and tropical conditions. It also compares the material savings and the life-cycle environmental impacts for the three designs against the Telescoping HSC design. Comparing the average overall peak forces, across all three environmental conditions of the Telescoping HSC boxes {{to that of the}} three designs, it was concluded that the Kisch FCT boxes were approximately 17 % weaker, while providing material savings of over 14 %; the Diagonal Corner Bliss boxes were approximately 9 % weaker, while providing material savings of almost 22 % and the Single V Kisch Bliss boxes were approximately 14 % stronger, while providing material savings of over 19 %. Savings in material ranging from 14 to 22 % for the three designs tested, translates into significant energy savings, relative optimization of natural resources, reductions in green house gas emissions and relative minimization of waste water and solid waste generated during production in comparison to the Telescoping HSC style boxes...|$|R
5|$|Thomas's new castle {{adapted the}} {{existing}} manor complex overlooking {{the head of}} the River Frome. Although the castle sat on a low spur it was overlooked by higher ground from the west and the north and was not ideally placed from a purely defensive perspective. Contemporary castle designs included the construction of huge, palatial tower keeps and apartments for the most powerful nobles, such as Kenilworth, expanded by Thomas's patron, John of Gaunt; or the construction of smaller, French influenced castles such as that seen at nearby Nunney Castle, built by one of Thomas's fellow nouveau riche landowners. By contrast, Farleigh Hungerford drew on the tradition of quadrangular castles that had begun in France during the early 13th century, in which the traditional buildings of an unfortified manor were enclosed by a four-sided outer wall and protected with <b>corner</b> towers. The <b>style</b> was well established by the late 14th century, even slightly old fashioned.|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} built in ashlar stone, {{and has a}} grey slate roof. Its plan {{consists}} of a nave with a south aisle and a south porch, a chancel, and a west tower. The whole of {{the exterior of the}} church is embattled with pinnacles at the <b>corners.</b> Its architectural <b>style</b> is Perpendicular. The tower is in three stages and has diagonal buttresses. In the bottom stage is a two-light west window; the middle stage contains a clock face on the north, west and south sides; and in the top stage are three-light bell openings. The porch has angle buttresses, and an arched doorway with a sundial above. On each side of the church are four-light Perpendicular windows, with five-light windows at the east ends of the nave and aisle, and at the west end of the aisle. Internally the arcade is carried on octagonal piers, the capitals of which are carved with acanthus leaves and ball ornaments. The roof is highly decorated, containing tie beams, corbels carved with angels and musicians, gilded pendants, and panels decorated with roses and other plants.|$|R
5000|$|Each episode {{had four}} acts. At {{the end of}} each act, the scene, usually a cliffhanger moment, would freeze, and a sketch or {{photograph}} of the scene faded in to replace the cartoon art in one of the four <b>corner</b> panels. The <b>style</b> of freeze-frame art changed {{over the course of the}} series. In all first-season episodes other than the pilot, the panels were live-action stills made to evoke 19th-century engravings. In season two (the first in color) the scenes dissolved to tinted stills; from [...] "The Night of the Flying Pie Plate" [...] on, however, the panels were home to Warhol-like serigraphs of the freeze-frames. The end credits were displayed over each episode's unique mosaic except in the final season, when a standardized design was used (curiously, in this design the bank robber is unconscious, the cardsharp has no card and the lady is on the ground, but the sixshooter in the upper left-hand panel has returned). The freeze-frame graphics were shot at a facility called Format Animation. The pilot is the only episode in which the center panel of the Hero is replaced by a sketch of the final scene of an act; in the third act he is replaced by the villainous General Cassinello (Nehemiah Persoff).|$|R
50|$|Platform {{construction}} {{is based on}} box designs and uses frame-and-panel construction in simple form during earlier periods evolving into more and more modified forms in later periods. While earlier pieces show full frame-and-panel construction techniques, {{different parts of the}} construction were modified through the centuries to produce diverse looking pieces which still share the same basic construction. First the panel, originally complete, is subject to cut-out sections, followed by further reduction to what may appear to be simply decorative brackets. Further refinement of the same pattern lead the shape of the decorative brackets being incorporated into the shape of the surrounding frame and simultaneously the two mitered vertical pieces comprising a corner become one solid piece. Pieces start to have small cross-pieces attached {{to the bottom of the}} feet rather than a frame that is equal on all sides and finally, with evolution of the complex woodworking joints that allow it, the cross-pieces are removed entirely, leaving a modern table with 3-way mitered <b>corners.</b> Unlike European-derived <b>styles,</b> table designs based on this style will nearly always contain a frame-in-panel top, the panel serving as the tabletop center and the frame sometimes also serving as what would be rails on a European table. Cabinets in this style have a top that does not protrude beyond the sides or front. The critical element in almost all pieces of this type is the mitered joints, especially the 3-way mitered joining of the leg and two horizontal pieces at each corner.|$|R
40|$|BARFIE (Books and Reading for Intercultural Education) is a European {{thematic}} network in intercultural education aimed at teachers, librarians, parents, children and school authorities that uses books {{and other media}} for children aged 6 to 16. BARFIE was developed in 2002, 2003 and 2004 with funding from the European Union as a Comenius network, involving at its core 14 European countries, with its teaching institutions, schools, libraries, and school authorities, while reaching out to involve schoolchildren, teachers, researchers, publishers and the public in general not only in those countries but all over Europe. BARFIE has developed a collection and catalogue of books for {{children and young people}} on intercultural education, which can be consulted at www. barfie. net and in book form. In the collection there are around 10 books from each of 14 European states that are members or partners of the BARFIE network. The books were carefully selected by experts on children’s books and young adult books, librarians, teachers and educators with the aim of developing ideas and concepts for teaching multiculturality, being European, fighting xenophobia and racism, integrating difference and celebrating similarities. Simultaneously, BARFIE developed an online catalogue of projects on intercultural education and children’s fiction, which pools together resources of European projects developed under the European Union framework, such as The Reader’s <b>Corner.</b> European <b>Style</b> Fairy Tales, at www. autopen. com/euro. fairy. shtml; Children’s Polar Library, at www. barnenspolarbibliotek. com/; Communicating tradition and culture across the internet: Traditional Tales at www. eurotales. eril. net; Europe of Tales, at www. europeoftales. net; Netlibris, at www. netlibris. net; and The European Picture Book Collection, at www. ncrcl. ac. uk/epbc/. BARFIE further developed pedagogical materials to be used in connection with the books in the collection in the form of seminars for teachers on: Global Citizenship; Getting to Know Central European Countries through Their Books; the European Picture Book Collection; Netlibris International; or Art Basics for Children; A Handful of Stories. In order to reach schoolchildren and teachers BARFIE developed teaching packages at European and local levels on: Learning English as a Foreign Language through BARFIE books; Introducing Portuguese and the Portuguese Culture through BARFIE Books; the BARFIE Picture Book Collection, as well as introductory sessions on particular books of the collection for school use. Finally, BARFIE brought together teachers, librarians, and researchers on its three seminars: the first took place in Vienna and was hosted by the Austrian Ministry of Education and the Kinderliteraturhaus in Vienna; the second venue was Bratislava and the BARFIE seminar joined efforts with the Biennial of Illustration in Children’s Literature and IBBY in Slovakia; the third seminar was held in Warsaw and was sponsored by the IBBY section of Poland and the Polish National Library and the Austrian Kinderliteraturhaus. This collection of articles tells you more about BARFIE, its efforts, aims and achievements. It describes work done under BARFIE inspiration and the enthusiasm of teachers who were keen to take the BARFIE books into their schools and thus broaden national curricula into European spaces of communication, exchange and intercultural learning. It offers you pedagogical materials to work from, ideas to take back into libraries and schools, as well as resources to integrate with your teaching and living. The collection of articles also presents scientific and pedagogical frameworks to think about children’s books, reading and interactive learning in contemporary Europe. In the three sections of the collection – Using the Resources of the BARFIE Network (section 1), From Books into Other Media: Reading, Using & Performing, (Section 2), and Children’s Books and Children’s Literature – Research and Position Papers (section 3) there is material for you to use in the classroom, in the library or at home, as well as material to reflect on and to improve your professional practice. This collection does not, however, describe all BARFIE activities. You can find more about these on the BARFIE webpage, at www. barfie. net, through the BARFIE newsletters, as well as through the contact persons in each European country that are on the partner section of the BARFIE webpage.
