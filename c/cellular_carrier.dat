5000|$|The {{impact of}} a {{femtocell}} is most often to improve cellular coverage, without the <b>cellular</b> <b>carrier</b> needing to improve their infrastructure (cell towers, etc.). This is net gain for the <b>cellular</b> <b>carrier.</b> However, the user must provide and pay for an internet connection to route the femtocell traffic, and then (usually) pay an additional one-off or monthly fee to the <b>cellular</b> <b>carrier.</b> Some have objected {{to the idea that}} consumers are being asked to pay to help relieve network shortcomings. [...] On the other hand, residential femtocells normally provide a ‘personal cell’ which provides benefits only to the owner’s family and friends.|$|E

50|$|The ad hoc {{networking}} technology {{operating on}} Wi-Fi ad hoc mode, at the unlicensed ISM band of 2.4GHz {{may result in}} profit loss by <b>cellular</b> <b>carriers</b> since ISM band is free and unlicensed while <b>cellular</b> <b>carriers</b> operate on licensed band at 900MHz, 1200MHz, 1800MHz, etc. This {{has the potential to}} threaten telecommunication operators (telcos). Smart phone mobile ad hoc networks can operate independently and allow communications among smart phones users without the need for any 3G or 4G LTE signals to be present. Wi-Fi ad hoc mode was first implemented on Lucent WaveLan 802.11a/b on laptop computers. The technology success is now carried forward and used in smart phones, since Wi-Fi is present and embedded in all smart phones today.|$|R

40|$|All {{mobile phone}} {{subscribers}} must pay a subscription fee {{to enjoy the}} convenience of this technology. Subscribers pay for the actual time spent talking on the cellular phone. Generally, {{there are two kinds}} of billing. With prepaid service, the subscriber buys a prepaid card and pays for the cellular phone service in advance. As the subscriber uses airtime the cellular phone account is debited the appropriate amount of cellular phone service used. When the subscriber runs out of dollars in the cellular phone account, they can no longer call until the account is prepaid for additional cellular phone service or airtime. With postpaid service, <b>cellular</b> <b>carriers</b> bill customers based on how many minutes of airtime they use each month. When the customer places a call on an activated cellular phone, each minute the phone is connected is counted. <b>Cellular</b> <b>carriers</b> bill the customer on a monthly basis for the airtime used. There are some issues worth discussing such as fairness, non-repudiation, and non-usurpation. In this paper we propose a fair and secure mobile billing system. We introduce the "observer" concept to supervise billing to make it more objective and accepted by both <b>cellular</b> <b>carriers</b> and subscribers. The proposed scheme can detect illegal phone calls in real time and the subscriber cannot deny the deserved fees. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|Using IS-54, a <b>cellular</b> <b>carrier</b> could convert {{any of its}} system's analog voice {{channels}} to digital. A dual mode phone uses digital channels where available, and defaults to regular AMPS where they are not. IS-54 was backward compatible with analogue cellular and indeed co-existed on the same radio channels as AMPS. No analogue customers were left behind; they simply could not access IS-54's new features. IS-54 also supported authentication, a help in preventing fraud.|$|E

Smart phone ad hoc networks leverage the existing hardware (primarily Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) in commercially available smartphones to create peer-to-peer networks without relying on <b>cellular</b> <b>carrier</b> networks, wireless access points, or traditional network infrastructure.

50|$|When the FCC held {{a lottery}} for {{cellular}} licenses {{in the early}} 1980s, many ordinary Americans got rich by winning the right to establish cellular systems in cities across America. In addition to entering the lottery himself, McCaw approached many other lottery winners and bought their cellular rights, which were already considered to be undervalued. Using the same tactic he'd used in cable TV, McCaw financed an aggressive cellular expansion by borrowing against and selling shares in the cable operation. Through continued borrowing and smart management of only the most useful licenses, this wireless land grab put McCaw's operation {{in the position of}} a competitive nationwide <b>cellular</b> <b>carrier</b> before the incumbent landline telephone industry took serious notice of the field.|$|E
