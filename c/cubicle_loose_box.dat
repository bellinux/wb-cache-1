50|$|Boxes {{allowing}} {{freedom of}} movement - horses are able to turn around, choose which way to face and lie down if they wish. These can also {{be known as a}} <b>loose</b> <b>box</b> (BrE), a stable (BrE), a stall (AmE) or box stall (AmE).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Loose</b> <b>Box</b> was a {{restaurant}} in Mundaring, an outer eastern suburb of Perth, Western Australia. During its 34-year existence, it won many awards for its classical French cuisine and service, and had {{a big impact on}} the hospitality industry in Perth.|$|R

5000|$|The farm {{contains}} several listed {{buildings and}} structures. The Great Barn is listed Grade II*. The farmhouse, cart shed, and the <b>loose</b> <b>boxes</b> north {{west of the}} barn are all listed Grade II. The [...] "K6" [...] model red telephone box on the farm is also Grade II listed.|$|R
50|$|Tattersall's Horse Bazaar, on Pirie Street {{adjacent}} the Town Hall, operated from September 1868 to 1887 or later. Aside from {{acting as a}} marketplace for horses and carriages, it also had stabling and <b>loose</b> <b>boxes</b> for short-term equine accommodation, and safe parking for carriages. Similarly-named establishments existed on Stephen Street Melbourne and in Perth.|$|R

50|$|The <b>loose</b> <b>box</b> pleats {{which are}} a feature of this style are {{sometimes}} called Watteau pleats from their appearance in the paintings of Antoine Watteau. The various Watteau terms, such as Watteau pleat, Watteau back, Watteau gown etc., date from the mid-19th century rather than reflecting authentic 18th century terminology, and normally describe 19th and 20th century revivals of the sack-back.|$|R

And no <b>loose</b> <b>box.</b> Well, people had {{contracted}} notions in those days! And the yard so small! Why, the one at Oakworthy would make four of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Their son [...] "Les" [...] Sheppard {{continued}} {{training at the}} family property at Stacey Street, Norwood, which included stables, <b>loose</b> <b>boxes,</b> and hayloft. Les was noted as a [...] "clocker", closely watching and recording the performance of his charges, and wrote for The News under the byline [...] "Lord Setay", in homage to the horse of that name, perhaps the finest his father trained.|$|R
25|$|The 6th Laird was {{involved}} in quarrying and limestone-burning, hence {{the need for a}} stable with room for three horses and <b>loose</b> <b>box,</b> with a loft above. Various modifications took place over the years and a Dutch barn was built in 1949. Dairying ceased in 1980 and the farm turned to raising beef cattle until 1992 when the National Trust for Scotland took over the running of the farm operations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house was}} {{originally}} {{built for the}} Wellingtonian councillor Kennedy Macdonald in 1878. When the estate was auctioned in 1893, due to Macdonald's bankruptcy, the building was described as having 14 rooms, 2 bathrooms, every modern convenience, water laid on, 2 conservatories, a vinery, a fernery, fowl house, wash house and offices, stable with 2 stalls and <b>loose</b> <b>box,</b> being in a salubrious and fashionable location, and an unrivalled family residence 20 January 1893 ...|$|R
5000|$|A livery yard or [...] livery stable (Great Britain, Ireland), or {{boarding}} stable (Australia, North America) is {{a stable}} where horse owners pay a {{weekly or monthly}} fee to keep their horses. A livery or boarding yard is not usually a riding school and the horses are not normally for hire (unless on working livery - see below). Facilities at a livery yard normally include a <b>loose</b> <b>box</b> or stable and access for the horse to graze on grass.|$|R

60|$|As {{she opened}} the door of the <b>loose</b> <b>box</b> in which Rosa was kept, she saw her eyes shining in the dark as she lifted her head with a startled air. Then, {{recognizing}} a friend, she rose and came rustling through the straw to greet her late visitor. She was evidently much pleased with the attention, and rubbed her nose against Miss Belinda gratefully, but seemed rather dainty, and poked over the contents of the basket, as if a little suspicious, though apples were her favorite treat.|$|R
50|$|The 1912 brick stables {{building}} contained stables for 40 horses, harness {{room and}} feed room. The building was E-shaped with external dimensions of 40m by 26m. As motor vehicles gradually replaced horses in police work, alterations to the stables building were undertaken in 1927 {{to provide some}} garage accommodation, and in 1936 a substantial brick garage and workshop was erected between the 1912 brick stables building and the 1907 timber dormitory block. At this period the 1912 stables still contained 15 <b>loose</b> <b>boxes</b> and 16 stalls.|$|R
25|$|The first brick built barracks {{were started}} in 1906, {{completed}} in 1907 and named Louisburg barracks. Built to house two regiments of artillery and a riding school, one in Louisburg East {{and one in}} Louisburg West. At {{the northern end of}} Louisburg Barracks Central Road, was a veterinary hospital with 24 <b>loose</b> <b>boxes</b> and 20 stalls, to care for sick artillery horses. This was added to in 1911 by the building of the Royal Engineer Lines and associated stables near Bordon crossroads, to accommodate 26th Field Company Royal Engineers.|$|R
500|$|The stables are {{connected}} to an adjoining two-storey house. They provided accommodation for ten horses and included four <b>loose</b> <b>boxes,</b> a harness room and a coachman's house; six bedrooms above were for servants. Two coach houses were later used as garages. The stables building was marketed in 1997 for approximately Â£70,000. Charles McKean describes the stables as [...] "straddling the skyline like a palace". The stables are listed by Historic Scotland as being at very high risk, and were described in 1997 sale literature as unused and dilapidated.|$|R
60|$|Heatherlegh, the Doctor, kept, in {{addition}} to his regular practice, a hospital on his private account--an arrangement of <b>loose</b> <b>boxes</b> for Incurables, his friend called it--but it was really a sort of fitting-up shed for craft that had been damaged by stress of weather. The weather in India is often sultry, and since the tale of bricks is always a fixed quantity, and the only liberty allowed is permission to work overtime and get no thanks, men occasionally break down and become as mixed as the metaphors in this sentence.|$|R
60|$|There was no tea {{and small}} talk at Hap House, {{but there were}} hunting-dinners. Owen Fitzgerald was soon known for his horses and his riding. He lived in the very centre of the Duhallow hunt; and before he had been six months owner of his {{property}} had built additional stables, with half a dozen <b>loose</b> <b>boxes</b> for his friends' nags. He had an eye, too, for a pretty girl--not always {{in the way that}} is approved of by mothers with marriageable daughters; but in the way of which they so decidedly disapprove.|$|R
50|$|In 1872, the {{development}} began {{again with the}} removal of the old stables and the building of the present Coach House and <b>loose</b> <b>boxes.</b> At the same time, the core of the present house, being the Billiard Room, Smoking Room and Dining Room, were added. These final two stages of expansion were undertaken by John Etherington Welch Rolls's son, J. A. Rolls. Raised to the peerage as 1st Baron Llangattock, Rolls employed first Henry Pope, who completed the dining room wing and, secondly, Sir Aston Webb, who added the Cedar Library.|$|R

50|$|Special {{accommodation}} {{was provided}} {{at the rear}} for race horses. There were ten secure and well ventilated <b>loose</b> <b>boxes</b> as well as ordinary stabling for travellers' horses. The proximity of the hotel to the race track ensured that the accommodation was full during the racing season. By 1886 the showgrounds were in regular use for sports meetings and the hotel was the venue for the presentation of prizes in 1886. It was also the terminus for the West End Omnibus Line which travelled between Tattersalls Hotel, Flinders Street East and West End Hotel.|$|R

50|$|Prior {{to the war}} it {{had been}} the {{practice}} that the players were allowed to change in the jockeys weighing room. The club was evicted from that accommodation because the scales used to weigh the 7 stone jockeys were unsurprisingly damaged by the 16 stone rugby forwards checking on the weight of this week's pack. The new accommodation consisted of two <b>loose</b> <b>boxes</b> the floors being covered in straw. A bath of sorts was constructed and filled from the copper boiler. Once everyone was changed, the ladies would provide tea amongst the now somewhat soggy straw, on trestle tables.|$|R
5000|$|Dried: Small bryophytes (mosses,Â hepaticsÂ or liverworts, and hornworts) are {{dried and}} placed loose inÂ folded packets. The label is glued on theÂ front of the packetÂ and the packets are filed <b>loose</b> in <b>boxes,</b> glued to sheets of {{mounting}} paper, or placed loose in folders.|$|R
60|$|The {{principal}} passetemps at Madeira {{consists of}} eating, drinking, and smoking; {{it is the}} life of a horse in a <b>loose</b> <b>box,</b> where the animal eats pour passer le temps. After early tea and toast there is breakfast Ã  la fourchette at nine; an equally heavy lunch, or rather an early dinner (No. 1), appears at 1 to 2 P.M.; afternoon tea follows, and a second dinner at 6 to 7. Residents and invalids suppress tiffin and dine at 2 to 3 P.M. In fact, as on board ship, people eat because they have nothing else to do; and English life does not admit of the sensible French hours--dÃ©jeuner Ã  la fourchette at 11 A.M. and dinner after sunset.|$|R
5000|$|During January and February, 2016, play:groundNYC {{installed}} and led {{an indoor}} adventure playground in the Brooklyn Children's Museum. The installation was {{located on the}} second floor gallery and consisted of <b>loose</b> objects--cardboard <b>boxes,</b> fabrics, rope, tape, and other materials. It was staffed by [...] playworkers.|$|R
50|$|Early {{fabric that}} survives include the {{majority}} of the perimeter walls which are constructed of English bonded brickwork. These walls have arrised corners to openings and engaged piers in the form of bull nosed brickwork to prevent injury. Several of the original openings in external walls are apparent including the bricked in windows to the Petrie Terrace elevation which correspond and provide evidence of the location of the stalls and <b>loose</b> <b>boxes</b> that were positioned along that elevation. Other elements include the roof structure of substantial timber trusses and large timber framed louvred ventilators to each of the ridges. The timber posts supporting the trusses to the central wing demonstrate where the former stalls and timber partition walls were located.|$|R
40|$|Graduation theses were inquired into {{question}} of presence of {{total bacteria count}} (TBC) in four selected cattle-raising. The breeds differ from each other with technology of lairege and milking, predipping, grazing and herd size. The first was lairage in stanction housing and in-stall milking pipeline system and embodied average values TBC from 10 â 103 â ml- 1 till 179 â 103 â ml- 1. The second breed was lairaged in loose grate without littered housing and got milking parlour and embodied average values TBC from 5, 5 â 103 â ml- 1 till 68, 75 â 103 â ml- 1. The third and the fourth breeds were lairaged in <b>loose</b> <b>cubicle</b> littered housing and got milking parlour and embodied average values TBC from 5 â 103 â ml- 1 till 34, 33 â 103 â ml- 1.

25|$|Green's mid-1860s Newmarket {{premises}} were in Station Road, {{very near}} where it joins the High Street. They were obviously very extensive as they included a vast half-mile wide straw-bed circle which, in hard frosts, other trainers (Blanton, Godding and J Wood are mentioned) he allowed to use. But Green's Newmarket premises were {{put up for}} sale at the White Hart Inn on the 13 February 1868 by auctioneer Ebenezer Feist and presumably he, as a quarterly tenant, was obliged to move to other premises in Newmarket at that point. Further details of the property are given though â a dwelling house with enclosed court yard, stalls and <b>loose</b> <b>boxes</b> for sixteen horses, hay, corn and straw chambers, carriage houses and an ample supply of spring water, within a short distance of the railway station.|$|R
2500|$|The robe Ã  la franÃ§aise or sack-back gown was looser-fitting and {{a welcome}} change for women used to wearing bodices. With flowing pleats from the {{shoulders}} was originally an undress fashion. At its most informal, this gown was unfitted both front and back and called a sacque. With a more relaxed style came a shift away from heavy fabrics, such as satin and velvet, to Indian cotton, silks and damasks. Also, these gowns were often made in lighter pastel shades that gave off a warm, graceful and childlike appearance. [...] Later, for formal wear, the front was fitted to the body {{by means of a}} tightly-laced underbodice, while the back fell in <b>loose</b> <b>box</b> pleats called [...] "Watteau pleats" [...] from their appearance in the paintings of Antoine Watteau.|$|R
