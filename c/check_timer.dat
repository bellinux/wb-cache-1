5000|$|OPROCd {{provides}} the server fencing {{solution for the}} Oracle Clusterware. It is the process monitor for Oracle Clusterware and it uses the hang <b>check</b> <b>timer</b> or watchdog timer (depending on the implementation) for the cluster integrity. OPROCd is locked in the memory and runs as a real time process. This sleeps for a fixed time and runs as the [...] "root" [...] user. Failure of the OPROCd process causes the node to restart. OPROCd is so important that even it is being monitored by a process called OCLSOMON and causes a cluster node to reboot if OPROCd is hung.|$|E
50|$|When Petrofsky {{starts to}} {{activate}} the bomb, on an impulse, he <b>checks</b> the <b>timer</b> first and realises he has been betrayed. At that moment, an SAS team storms the house and during a struggle, Preston subdues and disables Petrofsky. To Preston's outrage, one of the SAS team cold-bloodedly executes Petrofsky, explaining afterwards that he had orders to do so.|$|R
30|$|For a link {{utilization}} decrease update, the Spine Switch Controller updates {{the link}} utilization and <b>checks</b> if the <b>timer</b> for deactivating Spine switches should start. The Spine Switch Controller has one timer for deactivating Spine switches and a timingmap (shown in line 6 & 9 in Algorithm 4, {{which is a}} list of Leaf switch IDs) to record the Leaf switches that satisfy the requirement of deactivating Spine switches. Only when all Leaf switchesâ€™ IDs are in timingmap, the Spine Switch Controller starts the timer for deactivating Spine switches. Then the Spine Switch Controller updates the information related with the timer for activating a Spine switch and switches OFF the timer if the requirement of activating is not satisfied any more.|$|R
500|$|Upon {{the finish}} {{of the race}} there was a dispute over the winning time of Secretariat. The {{electronic}} Visumatic timer on the field read 1:55, while Daily Racing Form clockers Gene Schwartz and Frank Robinson timed Secretariat at 1:, which would have broken the track record. The official fractional times were 25, , 1:12, and 1:, while the Daily Racing Forum timed the fractions at , 47, 1:, and 1:. The next day, Secretariat's trainer Lucien Laurin asked for the videotape to be reviewed because he felt that if Secretariat did run that fast, then [...] "he deserves the record." [...] On May 21, race officials adjusted Secretariat's winning time to 1:, becoming the then second fastest time in race history. The time was changed to the time obtained by the official Pimilico timekeeper E.T. McLean per Rule 383 of the Maryland Rules of Racing, which stated the [...] "official timer's time is official." [...] McLean's stopwatch was faster than the Visumatic by three-fifths of a second at each fractional." [...] That same day, a Visumatic official <b>checked</b> the <b>timer</b> and stated that the timer should have actually read 1:, rather than 1:55. It was determined that the chart for the Preakness would display McLean's time as the winning time, with the Daily Racing Forum time written next to it, in parenthesis.|$|R
3000|$|... b {{shows that}} the {{achieved}} throughput of PowerNap is better than IEEE 802.11 PSM and SleepWell. In both PowerNap and IEEE 802.11 PSM, the beacon interval has a significant contribution in network throughput as the increased value of beacon interval produces less overhead and the network throughput increases. As stated in our algorithm, it increases the listen time and shortens the overhear time of clients. During listen time, an AP <b>checks</b> if the <b>timer</b> is matured, and during overhear time, an AP overhears the channel for packets. In standard PSM, after waking up, every client overhears the channel for the entire beacon interval; however, in PowerNap, one client overhears the channel only when the AP associated with it is active for transmission. Similarly, the SleepWell incurs much overhead for repeated migration operations, and thus, it keeps the users in overhear mode for longer duration. As expected theoretically, for increasing beacon intervals, the protocol operation overheads of the studied protocols are drecreased, as shown in Fig. 4 [...]...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{cell cycle}} in higher eukaryotes and their {{molecular}} networks signals both in G 1 /S and G 2 /M transitions are replicated in silico. Biochemical kinetics, {{converted into a}} set of differential equations, and system control theory are employed to design multi-nested digital layers to simulate protein-to-protein activation and inhibition for cell cycle dynamics {{in the presence of}} damaged genomes. Sequencing and controlling the digital process of four micro-scale species networks (p 53 /Mdm 2 /DNA damage, p 21 mRNA/cyclin-CDK complex, CDK/CDC 25 /wee 1 / SKP 2 /APC/CKI and apoptosis target genes system) not only allows the comprehension of the mechanisms of these molecule interactions but paves the way for unraveling the participants and their by-products, until now quite unclear, which have the task of carrying out (or not) cell death. Whatever the running simulations (e. g., different species signals, mutant cells and different DNA damage levels), the results of the proposed cell digital multi-layers give reason to believe in the existence of a universal apoptotic mechanism. As a consequence, we identified and selected cell <b>check</b> points, sizers, <b>timers</b> and specific target genes dynamic both for influencing mitotic process and avoiding cancer proliferation as much as for leading the cancer cell(s) to collapse into a steady stable apoptosis phase...|$|R
