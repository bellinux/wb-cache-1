30|$|The dataset {{of choice}} in the {{majority}} of the surveyed literature has been based on KDD’ 99, an out-dated dataset. On one hand, this has provided the community with the ability to compare and contrast different methods and techniques. On the other hand, it does not reflect the recent more relevant types of attacks. Moreover, even the normal <b>connection</b> <b>traces</b> represent basic applications (e.g. email and file-transfer) without any inclusion to more recent day-to-day applications that swarms the network (e.g. social media and video streaming). This is further aggravated by the several limitations and flaws reported about this dataset [438]. Indeed, there is a dire need for a new dataset for intrusion detection.|$|E
40|$|In {{cellular}} networks, {{spectral efficiency}} {{is a key}} parameter when designing network infrastructure. Despite the existence of theoretical model for this parameter, experience shows that real spectral efficiency is influenced by multiple factors that greatly vary {{in space and time}} and are difficult to characterize. In this paper, an automatic method for deriving the real spectral efficiency curves of a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system on a per-cell basis is proposed. The method is based on a trace processing tool that makes the most of the detailed network performance measurements collected by base stations. The method is conceived as a centralized scheme that can be integrated in commercial network planning tools. Method assessment is carried out with a large dataset of <b>connection</b> <b>traces</b> taken from a live LTE system.

40|$|For network {{planning}} and optimization purposes, mobile operators {{make use of}} Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), computed from Performance Measurements (PMs), to determine whether network performance needs to be improved. In current networks, PMs, and therefore KPIs, suffer from lack of precision due to an insufficient temporal and/or spatial granularity. In this work, an automatic method, based on data traces, is proposed to improve the accuracy of radio network utilization measurements collected in a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network. The method’s output is an accurate estimate of the spatial and temporal distribution for the cell utilization ratio that can be extended to other indicators. The method {{can be used to}} improve automatic {{network planning}} and optimization algorithms in a centralized Self-Organizing Network (SON) entity, since potential issues can be more precisely detected and located inside a cell thanks to temporal and spatial precision. The proposed method is tested with real <b>connection</b> <b>traces</b> gathered in a large geographical area of a live LTE network and considers overload problems due to trace file size limitations, which is a key consideration when analysing a large network.

A novel aspect {{of the study is}} the development of a method to construct empirical application-level models for arbitrary client/server (request /response) application-level protocols based on an analysis of unidirectional traces of only the TCP/IP headers in the traffic generated by the applications. By analyzing large collections of application-specific traces from a number of sources, we are producing empirical distributions to populate stochastic models of HTTP, FTP, and SMTP. However, combined, these applications represent less than 50 % of the observed TCP traffic on our campus.

40|$|Anonymity is {{important}} to perpetrators of network-based attacks. One of the simplest ways to remain anonymous is to hide the source of an attack by chaining together multiple connections into an extended connection. This is typically done by logging into a remote host, then from there logging into a third and fourth and so on until, at the final host, an attack is launched. These intermediate hosts are called stepping stones. Tracing such an attack {{back to the original}} source is difficult. Some techniques exist to <b>trace</b> individual <b>connections,</b> but <b>tracing</b> an extended <b>connection</b> requires identifying related connection pairs at each stepping stone. This paper examines the problems and approaches to <b>connection</b> <b>tracing,</b> focusing on <b>tracing</b> extended <b>connections</b> across stepping stones. We survey the literature and discuss the several techniques that have been offered so far for discovering related connection pairs, and offer a taxonomy of these techniques. We then discuss a set of experiments performed on four selected algorithms to compare them and gain better understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses. An architecture for an integrated attack attribution system, including both stepping stone detection and IP traceback, is offered, followed by concluding remarks and observations. Our future work will include constructing the master function and installing stepping stone detection extensions into SPIE to provide a more complete traceback solution. ...|$|R

However, this was markedly reduced in type 1 diabetes, suggesting a significant loss of bone marrow innervation.

In the hypothalamus and granular insular cortex of mice with type 1 diabetes, bone marrow–derived microglia/macrophages were activated and found at a greater density than in controls. Infiltration of CD 45 +/CCR 2 +/GR- 1 +/Iba- 1 + bone marrow–derived monocytes into the hypothalamus could be mitigated by treatment with minocycline, an anti-inflammatory agent capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier.

40|$|Background: Since the {{emergence}} of diffusion tensor imaging, {{a lot of work}} has been done to better understand the properties of diffusion MRI tractography. However, the validation of the reconstructed fiber connections remains problematic in many respects. For example, it is difficult to assess whether a connection {{is the result of the}} diffusion coherence contrast itself or the simple result of other uncontrolled parameters like for example: noise, brain geometry and algorithmic characteristics. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work, we propose a method to estimate the respective contributions of diffusion coherence versus other effects to a tractography result by comparing data sets with and without diffusion coherence contrast. We use this methodology to assign a confidence level to every gray matter to gray matter connection and add this new information directly in the connectivity matrix. Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate that whereas we can have a strong confidence in mid- and long-range connections obtained by a tractography experiment, it is difficult to distinguish between short <b>connections</b> <b>traced</b> due to diffusion coherence contrast from those produced by chance due to the other uncontrolled factors of the tractograph...|$|R

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of social networks and their usage {{by a wide}} spectrum of user profiles has been specially notable in the last decade. A social network is frequently conceived as a strongly interlinked community of users, each featuring a compact neighborhood tightly and actively connected through different communication flows. This realm unleashes a rich substrate for a myriad of malicious activities aimed at unauthorizedly profiting from the user itself or from his/her social circle. This manuscript elaborates on a practical approach for the detection of identity theft in social networks, by which the credentials of a certain user are stolen and used without permission by the attacker for its own benefit. The proposed scheme detects identity thefts by exclusively analyzing <b>connection</b> time <b>traces</b> of the account being tested in a nonintrusive manner. The manuscript formulates the detection of this attack as a binary classification problem, which is tackled by means of a support vector classifier applied over features inferred from the original <b>connection</b> time <b>traces</b> of the user.
