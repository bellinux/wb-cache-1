40|$|The beta-binomial (BBM) <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> was {{recently}} proposed {{to model the}} overdispersed statistics of empirically observed bit errors in multi-level cell (MLC) flash memories. In this paper, we study {{the capacity of the}} BBM <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> for MLC flash memories. Using the compound channel approach, we first show that the BBM <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> capacity is zero. However, through empirical observation, this appears to be a very pessimistic estimate of the flash memory channel capacity. We propose a refined <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> called the truncated-support beta-binomial (TS-BBM) <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> and derive its capacity. Using empirical error statistics from 1 X-nm and 2 Y-nm MLC flash memories, we numerically estimate the TS-BBM <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> capacity {{as a function of the}} program/erase (P/E) cycling stress. The capacity of the 2 -TS-BBM <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> provides an upper bound on the coding rates for the flash memory chip assuming a single binary error correction code is used.

This paper presents parameterization {{and validation}} of the <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> for peer-to-peer communication in the 300 MHz band. Measurements were carried out in outdoor environments for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. The COST 2100 <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> is characterized and parameterized based on clusters. The KpowerMeans algorithm and a Kalman filter are used for identifying and tracking clusters from measurements. General issues regarding the parameterization for the <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> are analyzed in detail. A full set of single-link parameters for the <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> is extracted from the measurements. These parameters are used as the input to the <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> validation processes, targeting delay spread, spatial correlation, singular value distribution as well as antenna correlation.

In this work, a {{methodology}} of statistical <b>channel</b> <b>modeling</b> for 60 GHz WLAN systems is proposed and a <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> {{for the office}} conference room envi-ronment is developed. The proposed methodology {{takes into account the}} most important properties of the indoor 60 GHz propagation channel such as large propagation loss and necessity to use steerable directional antennas by the WLAN stations, quasi-optical propagation nature, clustering structure of the channel, and significant impact of the polarization characteristics. A general mathematical structure of the <b>channel</b> <b>model</b> that supports all the de-scribed 60 GHz propagation channel properties is sug-gested.

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} {{degraded}} compound multi-receiver wiretap channel, {{which consists of}} two groups of users {{and a group of}} eavesdroppers. We consider two different communication scenarios. In both scenarios, the transmitter sends two confidential messages, one for each group of users. In the first scenario, both messages need to be kept confidential from the eavesdroppers. For this scenario, we assume {{that there is only one}} eavesdropper. We obtain the secrecy capacity region for the general discrete memoryless <b>channel</b> <b>model,</b> the parallel <b>channel</b> <b>model,</b> and the Gaussian parallel <b>channel</b> <b>model.</b> For the Gaussian multi-input multi-output (MIMO) <b>channel</b> <b>model,</b> we obtain the secrecy capacity region when there is only one user in the second group. In the second scenario, the message sent to the first group of users needs to be kept confidential from both the second group of users and eavesdroppers, whereas the message sent to the second group of users needs to be kept confidential only from the eavesdroppers. For this scenario, we do not put any restriction on the number of eavesdroppers. We find the secrecy capacity region for the general discrete memoryless <b>channel</b> <b>model,</b> the parallel <b>channel</b> <b>model,</b> and the Gaussian parallel <b>channel</b> <b>model.</b> For the Gaussian MIMO <b>channel</b> <b>model,</b> we obtain the secrecy capacity region when there is only one user in the second group.

50|$|Good {{error control}} {{performance}} requires the scheme {{to be selected}} based {{on the characteristics of}} the communication channel. Common <b>channel</b> <b>models</b> include memory-less models where errors occur randomly and with a certain probability, and dynamic models where errors occur primarily in bursts.

Some codes can also be suitable for a mixture of random errors and burst errors.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{advantages}} of stage pin connectors, many smaller installations use Edison connectors due to their availability and the ease of connecting equipment to outlets already available in a building.

50|$|In most <b>channel</b> <b>models</b> with {{variable}} length messages, {{the probability of}} error-free reception diminishes in inverse proportion with increasing message length. In other words it's easier to receive a short message than a longer message. Therefore standard ARQ techniques involving {{variable length}} messages have increased difficulty delivering longer messages, as each repeat is the full length. Selective re-transmission applied to variable length messages completely eliminates the difficulty in delivering longer messages, as successfully delivered sub-blocks are retained after each transmission, {{and the number of}} outstanding sub-blocks in following transmissions diminishes. Selective Repeat is implemented in UDP transmission.|$|E

50|$|Transaction-level {{modeling}} (TLM) is {{a high-level}} approach to modeling digital systems where details of communication among modules {{are separated from}} {{the details of the}} implementation of functional units or of the communication architecture. Communication mechanisms such as buses or FIFOs are modeled as channels, and are presented to modules using SystemC interface classes. Transaction requests take place by calling interface functions of these <b>channel</b> <b>models,</b> which encapsulate low-level details of the information exchange. At the transaction level, the emphasis is more on the functionality of the data transfers - what data are transferred to and from what locations - and less on their actual implementation, that is, on the actual protocol used for data transfer. This approach makes it easier for the system-level designer to experiment, for example, with different bus architectures (all supporting a common abstract interface) without having to recode models that interact with any of the buses, provided these models interact with the bus through the common interface.|$|E
