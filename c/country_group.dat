40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} which of the alternative trade models (Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson, Chamberlin-Heckscher-Ohlin and Monopolistic Competition) is more effective in Turkey’s bilateral international trade. For this aim, Turkey’s bilateral trade with 62 trading partners is analyzed for the 1982 - 2000 period by using panel data. The model used in the study is the extended version of the model used by Cieslik (2007). The model is first estimated for all 62 countries, then the <b>countries</b> are <b>grouped</b> as low-income and high-income countries and estimations are repeated for these <b>country</b> <b>groups.</b> The empirical findings are similar for all <b>country</b> <b>groups.</b> The findings reveal that the Chamberlin-Heckscher-Ohlin model is more effective in explaining Turkey’s international trade with all <b>country</b> <b>groups.</b> Under the assumption of two goods, the model takes one good as homogenous and the other as differentiated. Consequently, factor endowments are not the only factors that affect Turkey’s trade. Also the economic sizes of the partner countries are important...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} income {{inequality}} {{and economic development}} relationship by using unbalanced panel data of OECD and non-OECD countries for the period 1962 - 2003.

Development has an indirect effect on inequality through control variables, but the modes are different in the two <b>country</b> <b>groups.</b> The model specification tests show that the relationship is not necessarily captured by the conventional quadratic function. The cubic and fourth-degree polynomials, respectively, fit the OECD and non-OECD <b>country</b> <b>groups</b> best. The finding is robust regardless whether the specification uses control variables. Development plays a dominant role in mitigating inequality. ...|$|R
