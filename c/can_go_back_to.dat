In fact, apart from ancient tales {{embedded}} in the 13th century Dutch folk songs, and some evidence of Celtic and Germanic mythology in the naming of days of the week and landmarks (see for example the 2nd century inscription to goddess Vagdavercustis), the folk tales of the ancient Dutch people were not written down in the first written literature of the 12th century, and thus lost to us.|$|E

The dashboard {{is divided into}} [...] "Home", [...] "Mixer", [...] "Community", [...] "Entertainment", and [...] "Store" [...] sections, with the [...] "Home" [...] page further divided into [...] "blocks" [...] that can display pinned games/apps, {{as well as other}} content.

Use of Kinect enables the ability to control the console via voice commands. Xbox One's voice control capabilities are similar to, albeit richer than those of Xbox 360. The voice assistant Cortana was added in 2016 to provide expanded voice command functionality with natural language recognition.|$|E

Brian goes to tell his teacher that he cheated, but is interrupted, as the teacher tells him Brian has inspired him, {{and he was so}} depressed that he was planning to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Peter becomes very satisfied with his A-Team's actions, but the team fails a mission to save a local park from demolition by becoming [...] "side-tracked by idle conversation" [...] with the builders.

Perry Nemiroff of Cinema Blend speculated that Tron 3 could be the first installment in a new trilogy. On January 13, 2011, Ain't It Cool News reported that the film was close to having its sequel announced as part of Disney's plan for Tron future. On January 21, 2011, Tron-Sector reported an unsourced rumor that a sequel to Tron: Legacy had been green-lit and a teaser trailer would debut on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of Tron and Tron: Legacy.

[...] On March 31, Kosinski said that the film's script was expected to be finished in two weeks and its working title is Tr3n.|$|E

It's quite clear that Nick Griffin just doesn't accept that black British people or black Welsh people are entitled to call themselves proper, full citizens of the country." [...] Griffin's {{interview with}} Channel 4 News was in response to a decision by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate the BNP's membership criteria, which, it stated, [...] "appeared to discriminate on the grounds of race and colour, contrary to the Race Relations Act." [...] He rejected claims that the BNP was [...] "acting unlawfully" [...] and said [...] "...because we are here, as it was pointed out, for specific ethnic groups—it's nothing to do with colour, your reporter there said that we'll only lift a finger for white people—that's a simple lie." [...] In an interview with the BBC on 8 July 2009, during a discussion on European immigration, he proposed that the EU should sink boats carrying illegal immigrants, to prevent them from entering Europe. Although the interviewer, BBC correspondent Shirin Wheeler, implied that Griffin may have wished the EU to [...] "murder people at sea", he quickly corrected her by saying [...] "I didn't say anyone should be murdered at sea—I say boats should be sunk, they can throw them a life raft and they <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Libya" [...] (a staging post for migrants from Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa).|$|E

2500|$|While {{playing as}} the Assassin characters, {{the games are}} {{generally}} presented as third-person in an open world, focusing on stealth and free-running. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, generally assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a [...] "leap of faith" [...] into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of Desmond, who by nature of the Animus use has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, {{as well as their}} genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. Through the Animus interface, the player <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> retry any past mission already completed; for example, in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner such as by only killing the mission's target.|$|E

We can't have Willow say, 'Oh, cured now, I <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> cock!' Willow {{is not going to be}} straddling that particular fence. She will just be gay." [...] Kennedy is markedly different from Tara. She is younger, outspoken, and aggressively pursues Willow, who hesitates to become involved again. When they first kiss in the episode [...] "The Killer in Me", Willow's realization that she let Tara go reacts with a curse put upon her by another witch named Amy Madison (Elizabeth Anne Allen), turning Willow into Warren, Tara's murderer. The spell is broken when Willow acknowledges her guilt and Kennedy kisses her again. Kennedy expresses that she does not understand the value of magic and assumes it involves tricks, not the all-consuming energy that Willow is capable of. When Willow eventually exhibits what power she has, it briefly frightens Kennedy. Willow worries about becoming sexually intimate with Kennedy, unsure of what may transpire if she loses control of herself.|$|E
