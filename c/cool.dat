5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, so we should expect {{that there are more}} <b>cool</b> white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs. This trend stops when we reach extremely <b>cool</b> white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, and one of the coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The {{reason for this is that}} the Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to <b>cool</b> below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, <b>cool</b> and become a non-radiating black dwarf in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} <b>cooling</b> performance comparison of various mass transfer <b>cooling</b> methods and different <b>cooling</b> media through two experiments. In the first experiment, pressurized air {{was used as a}} <b>cooling</b> medium and two different circular tubes were used as specimens. One is made of impermeable solid material with four rows of discrete holes to simulate film <b>cooling,</b> and the other consists of sintered porous material to create a porous transpiration <b>cooling</b> effect. The natures of transpiration <b>cooling</b> and film <b>cooling</b> including leading and trailing edge injection <b>cooling</b> were compared. This experiment found that by using a gaseous <b>cooling</b> medium, transpiration <b>cooling</b> could provide a higher <b>cooling</b> effect and a larger coolant coverage than film <b>cooling</b> in the leading stagnation region, and {{on the side of the}} specimen at the same coolant injection flow rates; but in the trailing stagnation region, the traditional coolant injection method through discrete film holes might be better than transpiration <b>cooling,</b> especially for turbine blades with thin trailing edges. In the second experiment, the <b>cooling</b> effects of gaseous and liquid media on the same porous tube's surface were compared. This experiment showed that the porous areas <b>cooled</b> using gaseous and liquid <b>cooling</b> media were almost identical, but the <b>cooling</b> effect of liquid evaporation was much higher than that of gaseous <b>cooling,</b> especially in the leading and trailing stagnation regions of turbine blades. This important discovery makes it possible to solve the stagnation region problems in turbine blade <b>cooling...</b>|$|R

The matrix <b>cooling</b> {{structure}} is useful for the structure stability however the <b>cooling</b> performance of internal <b>cooling</b> channel was not enough for <b>cooling.</b> Therefore, we designed the rib configurations in the matrix <b>cooling</b> channel to enhance the <b>cooling</b> performance. The numerical simulation was conducted to analyze <b>cooling</b> performance of rib configured matrix <b>cooling</b> channel. Three different rib configurations were used which are vertical rib, angled rib and c-type rib. Three configurations were adopted in two positions of matrix <b>cooling</b> channel which is one fourth and three fourth of channel. The result shows that downstream rib has much higher <b>cooling</b> performance than upstream rib. Furthermore, the angled rib in the channel has much higher <b>cooling</b> performance than vertical rib. This is because; the angled rib improves the swirl effect of matrix <b>cooling</b> channel more effectively. The friction factor was increased with the installation of rib. However, the thermal performance was increased with the installation of rib in the matrix <b>cooling</b> channel...|$|R
