Pure indium wire or solder preform washers are accepted as the most reliable low temperature sealing materials.

40|$|A {{computer}} program implements a numerical model of thermal effects of cavitation in <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fluids.</b> The model and program were developed {{for use in}} designing and predicting the performances of turbopumps for <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fluids.</b> Prior numerical models {{used for this purpose}} do not account for either the variability of properties of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>fluids</b> or the thermal effects (especially, evaporative cooling) involved in cavitation.
