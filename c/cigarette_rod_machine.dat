Its measure precision {{is difficult to}} satisfy practice demand and it cannot implement online measure. In order to overcome these shortages, imaging measure technology is used to measure <b>cigarette</b> filter <b>rod</b> parameters. Firstly, preprocessing filtering is operated on the image acquired from imaging measure system. Then binary <b>cigarette</b> filter <b>rod</b> target image is obtained through Otsu segmentation method. After that target feature extraction is processed and correlative parameters of <b>cigarette</b> filter <b>rod</b> are gained. Parameters measuring absolute error for two images which are acquired from the same <b>cigarette</b> filter <b>rod</b> under different illumination is 0. 683 %. Experiment proves that the proposed method can rapidly and correctly measure <b>cigarette</b> filter <b>rod</b> and has good robust and adaptability. It can effectively measure <b>cigarette</b> filter <b>rod</b> in practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that slender <b>rod</b> <b>machining</b> {{operation}} is a very difficult problem due to its low stiffness. During slender <b>rod</b> <b>machining</b> process, the deflection, vibration, cutting heat and cutting force of the machined part are the main reasons affecting the product quality. Based on the analysis of current research status of slender rod milling technology, process scheme, milling strategy, clamping fixture and tool designing is carried out in this work. In a roughing milling stage, we create a new strategy of square rod milling, called “equilateral milling strategy ” to eliminating deflection. In finish-milling top waveform stage, a way using semicircle profile cutter to finish was applied. Complex interpolated movement is transform into simple two-dimension curved movement to shorten machine time and increase of efficiency in the way. In addition, machined surface with burnishing effect, high precision and high surface quality is obtained...|$|R

40|$|In {{their recent}} analysis, Shihadeh and Eissenberg 1 support that by {{regulating}} nicotine flux in electronic cigarettes (ECs) {{could be a}} valuable tool in the regulatory process that would increase effective-ness and reduce the chance for abuse liability. Herein, we present the view that such a regulation could endanger the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as smoking substitutes. Nicotine Delivery From Tobacco Cigarettes Although tobacco cigarettes deliver 1 – 3 mg of nicotine (from about 14 mg in each rod), the levels of daily nicotine intake may vary con-siderably between users. This is partly attributed to a substantial variability in nicotine intake per cigarette caused by different smok-ing intensity. 2 It is also possible to smoke more than one cigarette consecutively, further avoiding the limitation of the tobacco <b>cigarette</b> <b>rod</b> standardized design. Therefore, smokers can adjust cigarette use based on personal needs, while it is extremely unlikely for smokin...|$|R

All carbon fiber composites used in today 2 ̆ 7 s applications are manufactured through a molding or extrusion manufacturing process. The finished product is normally not machined. However there are instances where machining to a finished size is desirable. ^ This research is focused on determining the strength and micro-structural characteristics of Uni-Directional vinyl ester-carbon fibre <b>rod</b> after <b>machining</b> with a carbide insert. This study examined the surface fractures, and the micro-structural changes before and after machining the carbon fibre rod. As part of the study, the tensile strength of the carbon fibre <b>rod</b> after <b>machining</b> was observed and stress and strain graphs were plotted. The machining of the carbon fibre was performed with cold compressed air as the coolant and a carbide insert having a trade name of Sandvik was utilized to perform the turning operations. ^ The study was conducted to determine, whether machined vinyl ester-carbon fibre rod retains a tensile strength comparable to virgin solid carbon fibre rod. Also the study determined the changes in the micro-structure of the surface after machining. The hypothesis of this thesis is that the strength of vinyl-ester carbon fiber <b>rod</b> after <b>machining</b> is adequate for use in fields such as automotive, paper production, aerospace and industrial applications. ^ This study also determined a testing method for carbon fibre composite rod.

30|$|On {{the basis}} of the present data, it is clear that reduced levels of {{sidestream}} toxicants and mainstream pyrolytic toxicants can be readily achieved with lower cigarette circumference, albeit at the expense of increased formaldehyde yields. Increasing HAC loading further reduced the yields of volatile toxicants, although the loading capacity was limited at the smallest circumference cigarettes. Combining these features led us to an optimum cigarette design (given the limitations of available manufacturable cigarette formats) for a reduced toxicant prototype with a 21 -mm circumference and a three-segment filter containing 55  mg of HAC and 20  mg of CR 20 (to address the substantial increases in formaldehyde emissions (Branton et al. 2011 b)). The split-tipping technology was incorporated to counteract lost diffusional opportunities for volatile constituents due to the shorter <b>cigarette</b> <b>rod</b> and paper length, as well as adding the potential for small reductions in MLE associated with the higher effective flow rate in the 21 -mm cigarette. The tobacco blend for this prototype incorporated TSS, BTT and low-toxicant tobaccos.|$|R
40|$|A {{sampling}} {{system has been}} set up to monitor a group of volatile smoke analytes (nitric oxide, acetaldehyde, acetone, benzene, toluene, 1, 3 butadiene, isoprene and carbon dioxide) from mainstream cigarette smoke on a puff-resolved basis. The system was able to record gas evolution profiles during puffing and interpuff periods without interruption (e. g. taking clearing puffs). Gas phase smoke analytes were sampled as close to the mouth end of the cigarette filter as possible in order to minimise any dead volume effect. The results revealed that, for some volatile species, a significant fraction (e. g. up to 30 % for benzene) in the cigarette mainstream smoke had been generated during the preceding smoulder period. These species were trapped or absorbed within the <b>cigarette</b> <b>rod</b> and then subsequently eluted during the puff. The identification of the two sources of the mainstream smoke, a smouldering source and a puffing source, has not been reported before. The observation contributes to the fundamental knowledge of the cigarette smoke formation and may have implications on wider smoke chemistry and associated effects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} the {{experiments}} {{described in this article}} was the comparison of integrated fixed film activated sludge (IFAS) and activated sludge (AS) system. The IFAS applied system consists of the <b>cigarette</b> filter <b>rods</b> (wasted filter in tobacco factories) as a biofilm carrier. The comparison with activated sludge was performed by two parallel treatment lines. Organic substance, ammonia and TP removal was investigated over four month period. Synthetic wastewater was prepared with ordinary tap water and glucose as the main sources of carbon and energy, plus balanced macro and micro nutrients. COD removal percentages of 94. 55 %, and 81. 62 % were achieved for IFAS and activated sludge system, respectively. Also, ammonia concentration significantly decreased by increasing the HRT in both systems. The average ammonia removal of 97. 40 % and 96. 34 % were achieved for IFAS and activated sludge system, respectively. The removal efficiency of total phosphorus (TP-P) was 60. 64 %, higher than AS process by 56. 63 % respectively. Keywords—Wastewater; biofilm carrier; <b>cigarette</b> filters <b>rods...</b>|$|R

Three types of <b>cigarette</b> filter <b>rods,</b> namely, triethyl citrate-cellulose acetate (TEC-CA) filter rods, triethyl citrate-cellulose acetate-paper (TEC-CA-paper) dual filter rods and cellulose acetate-paper-triethyl citrate (CA-paper-TEC) dual filter rods, were manufactured. In order to promote the curing of CA rods, high-frequency radiation was introduced into the procedure of filter manufacture. Then Virginia type cigarettes, combined with the three kinds of prepared filter rods were manufactured and the removal efficiency of phenols from the cigarette mainstream smoke was investigated. The results revealed that no matter where the triethyl citrate was applied as plasticizer or coating additive, the content of phenol, o-, m-and p-cresol in cigarette mainstream smoke could be greatly reduced. The optimal removal efficiency for phenol was 50 % compared with the control. [Beitr. Tabakforsch. Int. 26 (2014) 176 - 182...|$|R
