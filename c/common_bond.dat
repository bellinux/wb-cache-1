5|$|Little {{is known}} of the brick schoolhouse that faces west onto Constitution Square and stands between the Watts-Bell House and Grayson's Tavern. Local {{tradition}} holds that it dates to approximately {{the same time as}} the buildings near it and that it housed a private school. According to the Danville-Boyle County Convention and Visitors Bureau, it was constructed around 1820 and was the first brick schoolhouse west of the Allegheny Mountains. The single-story, two-room edifice is built upon a fieldstone foundation with brick laid in <b>common</b> <b>bond</b> and an off-center entrance with a transom above. While Constitution Square was a part of the state park system, the park manager lived in the schoolhouse. After the park's transfer to Boyle County, the schoolhouse was converted into a conference center with meeting space.|$|E

Most members of West Pakistan's ruling elite also belonged to a liberal society, yet understood a common faith as the mobilising factor behind Pakistan's creation and the subsuming of Pakistan's multiple identities into one.|$|E

25|$|The Women's Little 500 is {{a bicycle}} race held {{annually}} at Bill Armstrong Stadium {{on the campus}} of Indiana University Bloomington. The race is modelled after the men's Little 500. The race has been run the Friday before the men's race, since its conception in 1988. It consists of half the distance of the men's race: 100 laps (25.49 miles) around the quarter-mile cinder track (410-meters) at the Bill Armstrong Stadium. Racers usually compete in teams of four, but teams can be as few as two, as long as that was the number of team members with which they qualified for the race. These teams usually have a <b>common</b> <b>bond</b> such as living in the same residence hall or being members of the same sorority, or they simply are an independent group with common interests. Each team is only given two bikes on which to ride and therefore, must compete in a relay-style that is rare in other races.|$|E
25|$|Thomas was {{admitted}} to the Missouri bar on September 13, 1974. From 1974 to 1977, Thomas was an Assistant Attorney General of Missouri under State Attorney General John Danforth, who met Thomas at Yale Law School. Thomas was the only black member of Danforth's staff. As Assistant Attorney General, Thomas first worked at the criminal appeals division of Danforth's office and moved on to the revenue and taxation division. Retrospectively, Thomas considers Assistant Attorney General the best job he has ever had. When Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney with the Monsanto Chemical Company in St. Louis, Missouri. He moved to Washington, D.C. and returned to work for Danforth from 1979 to 1981 as a Legislative Assistant handling energy issues for the Senate Commerce Committee. The two men shared a <b>common</b> <b>bond</b> in that they had studied to be ordained (although in different denominations). Danforth was to be instrumental in championing Thomas for the Supreme Court.|$|E
500|$|Rosamond McKitterick {{observes that}} [...] "the zeal for monastic reform {{undoubtedly}} was a <b>common</b> <b>bond</b> right across Europe". On the other hand, relations between monasteries and their patrons varied. Where rulers were weak, as in Burgundy, Cluny {{looked to the}} papacy for protection, whereas in other areas such as Flanders, monasteries had close links with local rulers. In England there was a close dependence on the royal family and very little papal influence. The accession in 959 of Edgar, the first king to strongly support reform, led to court support for the imposition of Benedictine rules {{on a number of}} old minsters with monks imported from houses such as Oswald's Westbury on Trym, Dunstan's Glastonbury and Æthelwold's Abingdon. Hardly any of the reformed houses were new foundations, but a few nunneries, which had royal connections, were established in Wiltshire and Hampshire.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} two (fully) compact polymer chains, coupled through an attractive interaction. These compact chains are represented by Hamiltonian paths (HP), and the coupling favors the existence of <b>common</b> <b>bonds</b> between the chains. Using a ($n= 0 $ component) spin representation for these paths, we show {{the existence of a}} phase transition for strong coupling (i. e. at low temperature) towards a ``frozen'' phase where one chain is completely adsorbed onto the other. By performing a Legendre transform, we obtain the probability distribution of overlaps. The fraction of <b>common</b> <b>bonds</b> between two HP, i. e. their overlap $q$, has both lower ($q_m$) and upper ($q_M$) bounds. This means in particuliar that two HP with overlap greater than $q_M$ coincide. These results may be of interest in (bio) polymers and in optimization problems. Comment: 13 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
500|$|Andersen {{referred}} to [...] "The Snowman" [...] {{as a simple}} fairy tale, but the story {{may be viewed as}} a metaphor for life. The Snowman remains frozen to the ground, questioning fate, existence, and all that he sees and experiences. In this respect, the Snowman shares a <b>common</b> <b>bond</b> with Hamletboth grope for what is hidden, for the real behind the surface. But there the similarities end. Scholars Jackie Wullschlager and Alsion Prince argue that Andersen's tales are expressions of his homosexuality, and Graham Robb author of Strangers: Homosexual Love in the 19th Century calls his work an [...] "Aesop of 19th-century homosexuality". and many of his heroes the victims of an unpopular sexual preference. [...] "The Snowman" [...] is a tale about misguided love, about a snowman who falls in love with what he believes is a female stove, and is Andersen's best argument for the price paid for falling in love with the wrong typewith the stove representing the danger in this [...] "wrong" [...] relationship.

500|$|On {{the first}} day in the studio, Garbage {{composed}} a new track, [...] "Right Between the Eyes", in 30 minutes. Other tracks written during the early sessions were [...] "Hangin' with the Bitches" [...] and [...] "Never Be Free" [...] (with John 5). Vig said that the quick start made the band feel optimistic and gave {{the impression that the}} album would be completed as rapidly as in six months, but [...] " [...] took a slow spiral downhill". Recording for the album was halted during the summer when Manson underwent surgery to remove a cyst on her right vocal cord, forcing her to recuperate until August 2003. On September 10, a backhoe careened into the outer walls of Smart Studios, causing extensive damage. Both Garbage and the band Paris, Texas had been working on their albums. The sessions were permeated by passive-aggressive tensions and an overall lack of artistic focus. According to Vig, [...] "there were a lot of personal arguments and we couldn't agree on songs". Manson suffered writer's block and had trouble writing lyrics, and Vig did not like the way the songs sounded. The drummer said that the group frequently argued during production, and that the entire band almost quit. Duke Erikson said that nobody could agree about the music's direction, and the band {{was on the verge of}} breaking up. He said, [...] "when you lose that <b>common</b> <b>bond</b> of the music, you've got nothing". Eventually, the group suffered [...] "a complete and utter band meltdown" [...] in October, leading the band members splitting and taking a break from the sessions.|$|E
