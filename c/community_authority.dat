We present data supporting the theory, which also shows that liberals misunderstand the explicit moral concerns of conservatives more than conservatives misunderstand liber-als. We suggest that what liberals see as a non-moral motivation for system justifi cation may be better described as a moral motivation to protect society, groups, and the structures and constraints that are often (although not always) benefi cial for individuals.

40|$|Health {{planning}} {{agencies are}} faced with the difficult mission of guiding change within a large complex social system whose power is dispersed. Initial short- and long-range plans have been established as frameworks, and now the major focus is implementation. Regulation (non-voluntary coordination) and voluntary coordination are the major means of implementation. Voluntary coordination is a significant strategy for consideration by Health Systems Agencies (HSAs). It may interact with regulation as a competitor, substitute, or complement. Because of limited regulatory powers, HSAs are dependent upon voluntary coordination as a major means of influencing behavior. Conflict, a major feature of voluntary coordination, has the potential of being used as a constructive means for dialogue; negotiation and bargaining may become positive approaches to arriving at decisions. Legitimized <b>community</b> <b>authority</b> is the primary source of authority in a strategy dominated by voluntary coordination as contrasted to state or federal mandates in a regulatory strategy.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the nature of}} the unorthodox ownership and governance structures that are emerging among firms and the way these structures are supporting the remarkable economic growth in the transition economies of East Asia, as represented in particular by China and Vietnam. These economies are embarked on a distinctive process of property rights reform that resists widespread privatization in favour of evolutionary transformation. From the perspective that organizational innovation is an adaptive recombination and ownership is a bundle of rights, this paper focuses on an evaluation of the extent and consistency of property rights reform in the state-owned enterprise sector of these economies. It reveals the features of the ownership and governance structures of Chinese township-village-enterprises and their consequences for liability and incentives and justifies the fact that private entrepreneurs are typically willing to include <b>community</b> <b>authority</b> as an ambiguous owner or shelter within the embrace of state-owned enterprises. The paper also explores the conditions which have motivated the reform, the impact of property rights structure and reform on enterprise performance, and the relationship between adaptability and accountability...|$|E

The central hypothesis addressed is that the fishery in historical terms was operated under a common property regime and that, under a number of forces, this has changed to an open access regime. The challenge facing government is to return the fishery to a common property regime. A conceptual framework which illustrates transformation ofthe fishery was developed. This was used to structure the research. Central question posed includes: what evidence is there that the fishery may have operated as common property system? what evidence is there that it now operates as an open access system? • what forces promoted such change, if indeed change has occurred...|$|E
