5|$|Caroline's main rival for Mac's {{affections}} is Sue White (Michelle Gomez), the Scottish staff {{liaison officer}} employed {{to listen and}} respond to the problems of East Hampton's staff. However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E
25|$|George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill, {{a man who}} is {{imprisoned for}} {{practicing}} law without a license. He claims to have escaped from prison so he can find a stash of money he had hidden, though in reality it is so he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his family before his wife remarries. He corresponds to Odysseus (Ulysses) in the Odyssey.|$|E
500|$|Signalling {{systems are}} shaped by mutual {{interests}} between signallers and receivers. [...] An alert bird such as a Eurasian jay warning off a stalking predator is communicating something useful to the predator: {{that it has been}} detected by the prey; it might as well quit wasting its time stalking this alerted prey, which it is unlikely to catch. [...] When the predator gives up, the signaller <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> other tasks such as feeding. [...] Once the stalking predator is detected, the signalling prey and receiving predator thus have a mutual interest in terminating the hunt.|$|E

500|$|Early in the case, {{political}} commentator {{and columnist}} Arianna Huffington wrote, [...] "If {{you were to}} get your news only from television, you'd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba. Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, Michael Jackson, when it's finally over I think, what a relief, now we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> real news. But we never do." [...] In March 2008, El Diario commented, [...] "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinos, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English language media, for example, appear {{to be focused on}} the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latino and African-American women often remain faceless, if and when they are even covered." ...|$|E
500|$|Cortana is {{constructed}} from the cloned brain of Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey, {{the creator of}} the SPARTAN Project; Halsey's synaptic networks became the basis for Cortana's processors. According to the Halo novels, Cortana is classified as a [...] "smart" [...] AI, meaning that her creative matrix is allowed to expand, in contrast to the limited matrix of other [...] "dumb" [...] AI characters in the stories. This ability allows Cortana to learn and adapt beyond her basic parameters, but at the cost of a limited [...] "lifespan" [...] of only seven years; eventually, she will fall to rampancy, a terminal state of being for Artificial intelligence constructs, in which the AI [...] "develops delusions of godlike power", as well as utter contempt for its mentally inferior makers. Rampant AI normally cannot return to their previous state and must be destroyed before they harm themselves and others around them, but Cortana could be saved if she and the Master Chief <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Dr. Halsey on Earth; because she was created using the living tissue of Dr. Halsey.|$|E
500|$|Discussing his {{decision}} to join The Young and the Restless, Burton said on The Talk, [...] "I told my manager if I can keep my family there and I can spend time with them {{and come back and}} forth, I would do that in a second. Without hesitation, CBS Daytime made that deal. Really quickly. This is crazy, but I'm just so happy to have {{the best of both worlds}} for my family, because before, I couldn't." [...] Burton was happy with the flexibility of his [...] "short term" [...] contract, [...] "I'll get a lot of long weekends and frequent weeks off so I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Nashville. I don't want to work five days a week like I did at GH", he said during a TV Guide interview. The actor said he had [...] "those first-day-of-school jitters" [...] when he first arrived at the CBS building, but was welcomed by everyone. A week before Burton's debut on the series, a promotional ad aired, teasing his arrival with the slogan Daytime's Hottest Soap Just Got Hotter!. In November 2014, Burton confirmed he had re-signed for another year with the series.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E
2500|$|Argile Smith, the {{executive}} vice president, {{the vice president}} of Integration of Faith and Learning, and Aguillard's eventual interim successor as the LC president, said, [...] "The faculty, staff, and students, have been so supportive through this journey. Our President has shown us how to work through a crisis with the kind of integrity that comes from a resilient relationship with Christ. Now that the crisis is behind us, Louisiana College <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> fulfilling our mission, 'to change the World for Christ!'".|$|E

6000|$|... "Running away, you fool!" [...] muttered the stranger, whose temper {{had evidently}} {{suffered}} grievously during the weary, cold journey from Chelwood. [...] "I'll break your satané head {{if anything happens}} to the beasts. How <b>can</b> I <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Bath save the way I came?

50|$|An {{extremely}} attractive lawyer's wife (Edwige Fenech) is ogled {{by almost}} all the men in her neighborhood, but one particularly nebbishly man (Tomas Milian) regularly phones her, complaining of the many erotic dreams she has inspired in him.

25|$|Piaget studied {{areas of}} {{intelligence}} like perception and memory {{that are not}} entirely logical. Logical concepts are described as being completely reversible because they <b>can</b> always <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the starting point. The perceptual concepts Piaget studied could not be manipulated. To describe the figurative process, Piaget uses pictures as examples. Pictures can’t be separated because contours cannot {{be separated from the}} forms they outline. Memory is the same way. It is never completely reversible. During this last period of work, Piaget and his colleague Inhelder also published books on perception, memory, and other figurative processes such as learning.|$|R
