5|$|Tropical Storm Dean {{originated}} from inside a frontal <b>cloud</b> <b>band,</b> which had moved off the Eastern Coast of the United States on September 22. During {{the next few}} days, the band became stationary from the Bahamas to beyond Bermuda. During this period, a 1035millibar (30.56inHg) high pressure cell had become settled over the northeastern United States. This resulted in a strong pressure gradient and winds near gale force along the eastern coast.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-level}} circulation {{formed from}} the frontal <b>cloud</b> <b>band</b> on September 26 about 460miles (740km) east of central Florida. Dean was first identified {{on the afternoon}} of September 26 as a subtropical storm. An Air Force reconnaissance flight was sent to Dean on September 27 and only reported winds of 35mph (55km/h) at 23miles (37kilometres) from the center. A pressure of 999millibars (29.50inHg) indicated that Dean was strengthening as it headed northward. Additionally, satellite pictures showed that the subtropical cyclone was emerging from the cloud. This data also showed that the storm was gaining tropical characteristics and was given the name Dean {{on the afternoon of}} September 27.|$|E
5|$|Located over warm waters with fair {{upper level}} outflow, the {{depression}} quickly intensified and attained tropical storm status twelve hours after forming. Upon strengthening into a tropical storm, Fefa developed a curved <b>cloud</b> <b>band</b> over the {{southern and eastern}} portion of the center. The storm slowly strengthened as it tracked west-northwestward, a motion due {{to the presence of}} a high-pressure ridge to its north. Fefa initially strengthened slowly; on the day after it became a tropical storm the center was located on {{the western edge of the}} deep convection. On July 31, convection began increasing over the center, and it is estimated it intensified into a hurricane later that day while located about 710miles (1,145km) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after {{becoming}} a tropical storm, {{the movement of}} Tanya became hindered by a nearby upper-level low, and it quickly turned eastward before virtually stalling early on October28. The upper-level low also influenced Tanya in giving it some subtropical characteristics, including a comma-shaped <b>cloud</b> <b>band</b> and maximum winds far {{from the center of}} the storm at the time. Despite that, the storm gradually strengthened as it remained over warm waters of about 81°F (27°C). That afternoon, it gained full tropical characteristics, as an eye featured was beginning to form in the central dense overcast. The eye became clearly defined, although it was small in size. Early on October 29, Tropical Storm Tanya was upgraded to a hurricane, the eleventh of the 1995season, as it turned northward in response to the nearby low.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} quickly {{showed signs}} of organization {{with the development of}} banding features around its blossoming convection. Due to a favorable upper level environment, forecasters predicted the depression to intensify to a 70mph (110km/h) tropical storm after making landfall on Haiti and eastern Cuba. Upper-level outflow remained well-defined, though convection waned near the center early on August 22. The depression appeared to continue organizing, with a well-defined <b>cloud</b> <b>band</b> to its north and east. However, strong southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly increased over the system, and the depression degenerated into a tropical wave late on August 22, south of the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic. The system retained a well-defined cloud pattern with a vigorous mid-level circulation, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center indicated regeneration could have occurred at any time. The wave axis moved over the Dominican Republic early on August 23, and became disorganized over the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola. There existed the potential for redevelopment as it moved into a potentially more favorable area, though the National Hurricane Center ceased monitoring the system on August 25 when redevelopment appeared unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the depression was embedded within the southwesterly flow between a ridge over the eastern Caribbean Sea and a mid-latitude trough, which caused a steady east-northeast motion. The convection organized into a central dense overcast with a well-defined <b>cloud</b> <b>band</b> wrapping partially around the center, and based on satellite imagery estimates the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status; late on December 4, the National Hurricane Center named the storm Odette. After being named, the storm intensified despite moderate southwesterly wind shear, and an eye feature became evident on microwave satellite imagery. Additionally, about three–fourths of a mid-level eyewall developed. The storm was assessed with winds of 40–50mph (65–85km/h), though the National Hurricane Center remarked the winds could have been stronger {{due to lack of}} structural data. The eye feature diminished as the convective structure deteriorated slightly, and Hurricane Hunters first flew into the storm at around 1200UTC on December 5. Odette tracked over an area of warm sea surface temperatures, and the overall cloud pattern gradually improved; the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted the storm to attain hurricane status. Early on December 6, a TRMM overpass showed an 80% closed eyewall, and at 0600UTC Odette attained peak winds of 65mph (100km/h) while located about 245miles (395km/h) southwest of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cases of {{mesoscale}} <b>cloud</b> <b>bands</b> in extratropical cyclones {{are observed}} {{a few hours}} after atmospheric grav-ity waves (AGWs) are launched from the auroral ionosphere. It is suggested that the solar-wind-generated auroral AGWs contribute to processes that release instabilities and initi-ate slantwise convection thus leading to <b>cloud</b> <b>bands</b> and growth of extratropical cyclones. Also, if the AGWs are ducted to low latitudes, they could influence the develop-ment of tropical cyclones. The gravity-wave-induced ver-tical lift may modulate the slantwise convection by releas-ing the moist symmetric instability at near-threshold con-ditions in the warm frontal zone of extratropical cyclones. Latent heat release associated with the mesoscale slantwise convection has been linked to explosive cyclogenesis and severe weather. The circumstantial and statistical evidenc...|$|R
500|$|A frontal <b>cloud</b> <b>band</b> moved {{offshore}} the East Coast of the United States on September22.

40|$|Several east–west-oriented <b>bands</b> of <b>clouds</b> {{and light}} rain formed on 20 July 2005 over eastern Montana and the Dakotas. The <b>cloud</b> <b>bands</b> were spaced about 150 km apart, {{and the most}} intense band was about 20 km wide and 300 km long, {{featuring}} areas of maximum radar reflectivity factor of about 50 dBZ. The <b>cloud</b> <b>bands</b> formed poleward of an area of lower-tropospheric frontogenesis, where air of modest convec-tive available potential energy was being lifted. During initiation and maintenance of the bands, mesoscale regions of dry symmetric and inertial instability {{were present in the}} region of the bands, suggesting a possible mechanism for the banding. Interpretation of the extant instabilities in the region of the bands was sensitive to the methodology to assess the instability. The release of these instabilities produced circulations with enough vertical motion to lift parcels to their lifting condensation level, resulting in the observed <b>cloud</b> <b>bands.</b> A high-resolution, numerical weather prediction model demonstrated that forecasting these types of events in such real-time models is possible, although the timing, evolution, and spacing of the bands were not faithfully reproduced. This case is compared to two previous cases in the literature where banded convection was associated with a combination of conditional, symmetric, and inertial instability. 1...|$|R
