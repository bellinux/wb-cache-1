A liquid bridge formed from a viscous Newtonian fluid or from a dilute polymer solution is first established between two cylindrical disks. The upper disk is held fixed and may be connected to a force transducer while the lower <b>cylinder</b> <b>falls</b> due to gravity. By varying {{the mass of the}} <b>falling</b> <b>cylinder</b> and measuring its resulting acceleration, the viscoelastic nature of the elongating fluid filament can be probed. In particular, we show that with this constant force pull (CFP) technique it is possible to readily impose very large material strains and strain rates so that the maximum extensibility of the polymer molecules may be quantified. This unique characteristic of the experiment is analyzed numerically us- ing the FENE-P model and two alternative kinematic descriptions; employing either an axially-uniform filament approximation or a quasi two-dimensional Lagrangian description of the elongating thread. In addition, a second order pertubation the- ory for the trajectory of the falling mass is developed for simple viscous filaments.

Simulations are carried out using commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT- 6. 2. The flow field around the cylinders is modeled in two-dimensions with the axis of the cylinder perpendicular to the direction of flow. The cylinder is modeled as a circle and a square flow domain is created around the cylinder. The calculations are carried out on a quadrilateral mesh. The simulations are performed for a Reynolds number of 200. The mesh is finer close to the cylinder wall {{in order to have}} a better description of the boundary layer. Contours of vorticity, variation of lift and drag coefficients, force time histories are presented. A mean repulsive lift force exists between the cylinders and the lift force steadily decreases with increasing length to diameter ratio.

40|$|When {{an object}} {{is placed on}} a water surface, the {{air-water}} interface deforms and a meniscus arises due to surface tension effects, which in turn produces a lift force or drag force on the partly submerged object. This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanism of the vertical force acting on spindly cylinders in contact with a water surface. A simplified 2 -D model is presented, and {{the profile of the}} curved air-water interface and the vertical force are computed using a numerical method. A parametric study is performed {{to determine the effects of}} the cylinder center distance, inclined angle, static contact angle, and radius on the vertical force. Several key conclusions are derived from the study: (1) Although the lift force increases with the cylinder center distance, cylinders with smaller center distances can penetrate deeper below the water surface before sinking, thereby obtaining a larger maximum lift force; (2) An increase in the inclined angle reduces the lift force, which can enable the lower <b>cylinders</b> <b>fall</b> more deeply before sinking; (3) While the effect of static contact angle is limited for angles greater than 90 °, hydrophobicity allows cylinders to obtain a larger lift force and load capacity on water; (4) The lift force increases rapidly with cylinder radius, but an increase in radius also increases the overall size and weight of cylinders and decreases the proportion of the surface tension force.

40|$|Simulations of {{free surface}} flows, {{as well as}} flows with moving {{boundaries}} in general, are quite difficult to describe with the classic, mesh-based Eulerian methods, such as finite difference, finite volume, and finite element methods. Meshless Lagrangian methods {{or a combination of}} Eulerian-Lagrangian methods that have the ability to describe the free surface with large deformations have been developing in the past fifteen years. In this paper, the Lagrangian incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (ISPH) method for simulating the dynamics of an incompressible viscous fluid flow is presented. The ISPH method is an attractive choice for the simulation of incompressible fluid flow because {{it is based on the}} simple SPH formulations, and it solves the pressure field implicitly using the projection scheme of solving the Navier-Stokes equations. A computer code for the simulation of the viscous incompressible fluid flow based on the ISPH method is developed.

40|$|One {{important}} {{application of}} fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites is as a confining material for concrete in the retrofit of existing concrete columns by {{the provision of}} FRP jackets. Such jackets are commonly formed in a wet layup process, with the fibers being only or predominantly in the hoop direction. It has been well established in recent studies that the rupture strains/strengths of FRP measured in tests on such FRP-confined concrete <b>cylinders</b> <b>fall</b> substantially below those from flat coupon tensile tests, but the causes are unclear. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study that is aimed at clarifying these causes. To this end, the paper reports and compares the ultimate tensile strains of two types of FRP (carbon FRP and glass FRP) obtained from three types of tests-flat coupon tensile tests, ring splitting tests, and FRP-confined concrete cylinder tests. Based on comparisons of these test results, it can be concluded that the FRP hoop rupture strains in FRP-confined concrete cylinders are reduced below the ultimate tensile strains from flat coupon tests by at least three factors - (1) the curvature of the FRP jacket; (2) the deformation localization of the cracked concrete; and (3) the existence of an overlapping zone. While the first factor that reduces the in situ strain capacity of FRP on confined concrete is material dependent, the last two factors that result in a nonuniform strain distribution in the jacket are independent of the FRP material properties. The third effect reduces the average hoop rupture but does not affect the distribution of the confining pressure, as the FRP jacket is thicker in the overlapping zone.

40|$|In a realm quite {{different}} from our own exists the small city state of Metallia. The economy of Metallia is based on mining various metals that are found deposited outside of the city. Once they are mined, these metals are stored {{in the form of}} giant, solid cylinders within the city walls. Over the years, a great controversy has raged over the optimal shape for these cylinders. It is well understood that the shape and size of a cylinder are determined by only two variables: the cylinder’s height (h) and the radius of its base (r). Some Metallians have contended that height is good, since a taller cylinder generally has more metal in it than a shorter one. Because of this, these Metallians have argued, it is good to have a high h to r ratio. Based on this notion, many cylinders have been melted down and reshaped to give them higher h to r ratios. Not terribly long ago the controversy over cylinder shape came to a head when two Metallian metallurgists, Ferrous Modigliani and Molybdenum Miller, argued that there is nothing magical about height: unless other factors beyond the simple principles of solid geometry are involved, no additional volume of metal can be created by reshaping cylinders. 2 Indeed, they devised a formula, V � h�r, which shows that if one quadruples h, the value of r is automatically halved and the volume of metal stays the same. This means that shape is irrelevant to the h= 4 volume of metal contained in the cylinder. This became known as the M&M irrelevancy result. h= 1 Many Metallians were deeply suspicious of the Modigliani and Miller result and thought it had to be wrong or didn’t apply to actual cylinders. r= 1 r= 2 Now Modigliani and Miller were very smart metallurgists, and they realized that there would be circumstances in which cylinder shape would matter. For example, they knew that the Metallian tax system favored height over width. Every year the tax authorities cut off a layer ten feet thick from the top of each cylinder. This means that tall and thin cylinders retain more of their volume, after tax, than short and wide ones. There are other considerations that can make cylinder shape matter. For example, tall and thin cylinders {{are more likely to be}} blown over by the wind, and when a <b>cylinder</b> <b>falls,</b> some of the metal it contains can be lost...|$|R
40|$|Summary In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{the problem of the}} ow of some non-newtonian uids (second grade, third grade and second order uids) in a <b>falling</b> <b>cylinder</b> viscometer. If the problem for a second grade uid is similar to the corresponding problem for linear viscous uids, largely discussed in Cristescu and all (2002), the other two problems are essentially dierent. The dierences (appearing in the velocity eld and shear stress component) are put into evidence. More, the formula of the shear viscosity for a third grade uid can be interpreted (for instance) as a relation for the determination of the sum β 2 + β 3 of constitutive moduli (and leads, {{in the case of the}} law obtained by Fosdick and Rajagopal (1980), to the complete determination of constitutive moduli).

An extensive bibliography is also presented and discussed in this paper and we refer to this one. However many biological uids have a signicant non-newtonian behaviour and for this reason we consider here the problem for some classes of non-newtonian uids like: second grade, third grade and second order uids.

In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling).

In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|R
