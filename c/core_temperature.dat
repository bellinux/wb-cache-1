5|$|The {{hydrogen}} fusion {{process is}} temperature-sensitive, so a moderate {{increase in the}} <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> {{will result in a}} significant increase in the fusion rate. As a result, the <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> of main sequence stars only varies from 4 million kelvin for a small M-class star to 40 million kelvin for a massive O-class star.|$|E
5|$|An {{elevated}} <b>core</b> <b>temperature,</b> {{leading to}} increased symptom presentation {{has been noted}} during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS {{during the course of}} exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure. The interaction between an elevated <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient safety and performance of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.|$|E
5|$|A better {{approximation}} {{is to take}} ε = L/M, {{the energy}} generation rate per unit mass, as ε is proportional to TI15, where TI is the <b>core</b> <b>temperature.</b> This is suitable for stars at least as massive as the Sun, exhibiting the CNO cycle, and gives the better fit R ∝ M0.78.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—As {{we move to}} {{exascale}} machines, both {{peak power}} and total energy consumption have become prominent major challenges. There {{has been a lot}} of research on saving machine energy consumption for HPC data centers. However, a significant part of energy consumption for HPC data centers can be attributed to cooling the machine room. We have already shown significant reduction in cooling energy consumption by constrain-ing <b>core</b> <b>temperatures</b> in our previous work. In this work, we strive to save machine energy consumption while constraining <b>core</b> <b>temperatures</b> in order to provide a total energy solution for HPC data centers that saves both machine and cooling energy consumption. Our approach uses Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to constrain <b>core</b> <b>temperatures</b> and is particularly designed to reduce the timing penalty associated with DVFS. Using a heuristic that exploits the difference in frequency sensitivity for different parts of an application, we present results that show 17 % reduction in machine energy consumption with as little as 0. 9 % increase in execution time while constraining <b>core</b> <b>temperatures</b> below 60 ◦ C.

40|$|Although Florida {{manatees}} (Trichechus manatus latirostris) {{have relatively}} low basal metabolic rates for aquatic mammals of their size, they maintain normal mammalian <b>core</b> <b>temperatures.</b> We describe vascular {{structures in the}} manatee tail that permit countercurrent heat exchange (CCHE) to conserve thermal energy. Approximately 1000 arteries juxtaposed to 2000 veins are found at the cranial end of the caudal vascular bundle (CVB); these numbers decrease caudally, but the 1 : 2 ratio of arteries to veins persists. Arterial walls are relatively thin when compared to those previously described in vascular countercurrent heat exchangers in cetaceans. It is assumed that CCHE in the CVB helps manatees to maintain <b>core</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Activity in warm water, however, mandates a mechanism that prevents elevated <b>core</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The tail could transfer heat to the environment if arterial blood delivered to the skin were warmer than the surrounding water; unfortunately, CCHE prevents this heat transfer. We describe deep caudal veins that provide a collateral venous return from the tail. This return, which is physically outside the CVB, reduces the venous volume within the bundle and allows arterial expansion and increased arterial supply to the skin, and thus helps prevent elevated <b>core</b> <b>temperatures...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{characteristics}} of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core. Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to evolve. The fusion of helium requires a higher <b>core</b> <b>temperature.</b> A star with a high enough <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> will push its outer layers outward while increasing its core density. The resulting red giant formed by the expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|Although thin, these {{outer layers}} {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} white dwarf. The degenerate electrons in the bulk of a white dwarf conduct heat well. Most of a white dwarf's mass is therefore at almost the same temperature (isothermal), {{and it is also}} hot: a white dwarf with surface temperature between 8,000K and 16,000K will have a <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> between approximately 5,000,000K and 20,000,000K. The white dwarf is kept from cooling very quickly only by its outer layers' opacity to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Most {{fish are}} ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), {{allowing}} their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, {{though some of}} the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher <b>core</b> <b>temperature.</b> Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.|$|E

30|$|The <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> of a {{human is}} one of the vital {{statistics}} used to determine individual health. Normal human body temperature (normothermia) is approximately 37 °C, with variations depending on factors such as age and geological factor [13]. When the body fails to regulate itself by dissipating heat, it increases the <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> above the normal condition. This condition is called hyperthermia. The highest recorded surviving <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> is 45 °C [14]. Generally, there are four locations [15] {{that can be used to}} measure human <b>core</b> body <b>temperature,</b> rectal (anus), oral (mouth), tympanic (ear) and axillary (armpit), with the rectal measurement considered to be the most accurate in measuring the <b>core</b> body <b>temperature.</b> Rectal measurement of body temperature is the preferred method to perform a <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> measurement. In order to track a patient’s <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> wirelessly (assuming the patient is not moving), the axillary measurement was chosen for the initial trial. The proposed measurement system must be able to measure within the temperature deviation [16, 17] of 0.3 - 0.5 °C and detect changes in the human body temperature (at minimum resolution of 0.1 °C).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Current {{knowledge}} about the incidence and risk factors for exertional hyperthermia (<b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> >/= 40 degrees C) is predominantly based on military populations or small-sized studies in athletes. We assessed the incidence of exertional hyperthermia in 227 participants of a 15 -km running race, and identified predictors for exertional hyperthermia. DESIGN: Observational study. METHODS: We measured intestinal <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> before and immediately after the race. To identify predictive factors of maximum <b>core</b> body <b>temperature,</b> we entered sex, age, BMI, post-finish dehydration, number of training weeks, fluid intake {{before and during the}} race, finish time, and <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> change during warming-up into a backward linear regression analysis. Additionally, two subgroups of hyperthermic and non-hyperthermic participants were compared. RESULTS: In a WBGT of 11 degrees C, <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> increased from 37. 6 +/- 0. 4 degrees C at baseline to 37. 8 +/- 0. 4 degrees C after warming-up, and 39. 2 +/- 0. 7 degrees C at the finish. A total of 15 % of all participants had exertional hyperthermia at the finish. Age, BMI, fluid intake before the race and the <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> change during warming-up significantly predicted maximal <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> (p< 0. 001). Participants with hyperthermia at the finish line had a significantly greater <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> rise (p< 0. 01) during the warming-up compared to non-hyperthermic peers, but similar race times (p= 0. 46). CONCLUSIONS: 15 % of the recreational runners developed exertional hyperthermia, whilst <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> change during the warming-up was identified as strongest predictor for <b>core</b> body <b>temperature</b> at the finish. This study emphasizes that exertional hyperthermia is a common phenomenon in recreational athletes, and can be partially predicted...|$|R
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star may {{accumulate}} sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites. The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required {{to compensate for the}} gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the energy}} {{produced}} at Vega's core is generated by the carbonnitrogenoxygen cycle (CNO cycle), a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. This process requires a temperature of about 15millionK, which {{is higher than the}} <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> of the Sun, but is less efficient than the Sun's proton-proton chain reaction fusion reaction. The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a convection zone about the core that evenly distributes the 'ash' from the fusion reaction within the core region. The overlying atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium. This is in contrast to the Sun, which has a radiation zone centered on the core with an overlying convection zone.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{scale of}} {{ecological}} organization is the biosphere: the total sum of ecosystems on the planet. Ecological relationships regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate {{all the way}} up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO2 and O2 composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals. Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the Gaia hypothesis is an example of holism applied in ecological theory. The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent feedback loop generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.|$|E

5|$|The most {{dangerous}} aspects of narcosis are the impairment of judgement, multi-tasking and coordination, {{and the loss}} of decision-making ability and focus. Other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances. The syndrome may cause exhilaration, giddiness, extreme anxiety, depression, or paranoia, depending on the individual diver and the diver's medical or personal history. When more serious, the diver may feel overconfident, disregarding normal safe diving practices. Slowed mental activity, as indicated by increased reaction time and increased errors in cognitive function, are effects which increase the risk of a diver mismanaging an incident. Narcosis reduces both the perception of cold discomfort and shivering and thereby affects the production of body heat and consequently allows a faster drop in the <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> in cold water, with reduced awareness of the developing problem.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical studies {{indicate}} that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core. In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its <b>core</b> <b>temperature</b> enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the second case, {{the core of a}} massive star may undergo sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova. While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.|$|E
