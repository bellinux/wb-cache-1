40|$|The {{popularity}} of the Internet {{and the emergence of}} broadband access networks is fueling the development of <b>communications</b> <b>processors</b> — devices that integrate processing, networking, and system functions into a single, low-cost, system-on-a-chip. These devices form the core of cable modems, ADSL modems, set-topboxes, smart packet phones, and a variety of Internet appliances. The conventional approach for designing <b>communications</b> <b>processors</b> is to start with a standard CPU core such as MIPS or ARM, add to this several network interfaces, and tie the whole system together with a multi-channel DMA controller. In such designs the DMA controller often becomes the most complex part of the system. The integration of processing and networking into the same device offers an opportunity to rethink the way the CPU and network interface interact. In this paper we describe UNUM, an architecture for integrating communications functionality into the CPU that not only simplifies the design of <b>communications</b> <b>processors,</b> but also improves their performance and provides them with greater flexibility...|$|R

50|$|<b>Communications</b> <b>Processor</b> Module (CPM) is a {{component}} of Motorola 68000 family (QUICC) or Motorola/Freescale Semiconductor Power Architecture (PowerQUICC) microprocessors designed to provide features related to imaging and communications. A microprocessor can delegate most of the input/output processing (for example sending and receiving data via the serial interface) to the <b>Communications</b> <b>Processor</b> Module and the microprocessor {{does not have to}} perform those functions itself. Some input/output functions require quick response from the processor, for example due to precise timing requirements during data transmission. With CPM performing those operations, the main microprocessor is free to perform other tasks.|$|E
50|$|A {{front end}} {{processor}} (FEP), or a <b>communications</b> <b>processor,</b> is a small-sized computer which interfaces to the host computer a number of networks, such as SNA, or a number of peripheral devices, such as terminals, disk units, printers and tape units. Data is transferred between the host computer and the {{front end processor}} using a high-speed parallel interface. The front end processor communicates with peripheral devices using slower serial interfaces, usually also through communication networks. The purpose is to off-load from the host computer the work of managing the peripheral devices, transmitting and receiving messages, packet assembly and disassembly, error detection, and error correction. Two examples are the IBM 3705 Communications Controller and the Burroughs Data <b>Communications</b> <b>Processor.</b>|$|E

This segment markets its products to the enterprise, data center, and wireless markets.|$|R
40|$|Multicore <b>communications</b> <b>processors</b> havebecome themaincomputing {{element in}} Internet routers and mobile base {{stations}} {{due to their}} flexibility and high processing capability. These processors are designed and equipped with enough resources to handle peak traffic loads. But network traffic varies significantly over time and peak traffic is observed very rarely. This variation in amount of traffic gives {{us an opportunity to}} save power during the low traffic times. Existing power management schemes are either too conservative or are unaware of traffic demands. We present a predictive power management scheme for <b>communications</b> or network <b>processors.</b> We use a traffic and load predictor to pro-actively change thenumberofactivecores. Predictivepowermanagementprovides morepowerefficiencythanreactiveschemesbecause itreducesthe lag between load changes and changes in power adaptations since adaptations can be applied before the load changes. The proposed schemealsousesDynamicVoltageandFrequencyScaling(DVFS) to change the frequency of the active cores to adapt to variation in traffic during the prediction interval. We perform experiments on realnetworktracesandshowthattheproposedtrafficawarescheme can save up to 40 % more power in <b>communications</b> <b>processors</b> as compared totraditional power management schemes.

50|$|Hubs are <b>communications</b> <b>processors</b> {{which allow}} for port-switching, {{similarly}} to switches. Both of these processors support automatic port-switching {{in order to}} provide shared resources access to the users of a particular networked environment. However, hubs do not manage traffic so every packet that enters any port is in output on every other port, resulting in packet collisions that interrupt the flow of traffic.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} this kind of change is Nvidia's nForce3 for AMD64 systems. It {{combines}} all of the features of a normal southbridge with an Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) port and connects directly to the CPU. On nForce4 boards it was marketed as a media <b>communications</b> <b>processor</b> (MCP).|$|E
50|$|During this period, NCR also {{produced}} the 605 minicomputer for in-house use. It was the compute engine for the 399 and 499 accounting machines, {{several generations of}} in-store and in-bank controllers, and the 82xx/90xx IMOS COBOL systems. The 605 also powered peripheral controllers, including the 658 disk subsystem and the 721 <b>communications</b> <b>processor.</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{expand the}} network, the Merit staff {{developed}} new hardware interfaces for the Digital PDP-11 based on printed circuit technology.

50|$|It is a {{multiplexer}} {{that connected}} multiple terminals into one communication {{line to the}} CPU, thus relieved the constraints on {{the maximum number of}} communication lines per CPU. A 3705 could support a larger number of lines (352 initially) but only counted as one peripheral by the CPUs and channels. Since the launch of SNA IBM has introduced improved <b>communications</b> <b>processors,</b> of which the latest is the 3745.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a packet}} {{forwarding}} protocol, acting like modern switch - forwarding data packages {{to the next}} node, which might be a mainframe, a terminal or another 3705. The <b>communications</b> <b>processors</b> supported only hierarchical networks with a mainframe at the center, unlike modern routers which support peer-to-peer networks in which a machine {{at the end of}} the line can be both a client and a server at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of guards {{began in the}} late 1970s with the creation of several [...] "Secure Communications Processors" [...] and [...] "Guard" [...] applications. The secure <b>communications</b> <b>processors</b> were high assurance operating systems and security kernels developed to support controlled plain-text bypasses for packet network encryption devices. The guard applications were designed to sanitise data being exported from a classified system to remove any sensitive information from it.|$|R
50|$|A NAS {{concentrates}} dial-in and dial-out user communications. An {{access server}} {{may have a}} mixture of analog and digital interfaces and support hundreds of simultaneous users. A NAS consists of a <b>communications</b> <b>processor</b> that connects asynchronous devices to a LAN or WAN through network and terminal emulation software. It performs both synchronous and asynchronous routing of supported protocols.|$|E
50|$|NDL (Network Definition Language) was a {{compiler}} on Burroughs large systems computers used {{to create}} a network definition file for a data communications controller (DCC) and object code for a data <b>communications</b> <b>processor</b> (DCP) that interfaced between a message control program (written in DCALGOL) such as (RJE), (MCSII) or (CANDE) and its line adaptors and terminal network.|$|E
50|$|PowerQUICC is {{the name}} for several Power Architecture based {{microcontrollers}} from Freescale Semiconductor.
