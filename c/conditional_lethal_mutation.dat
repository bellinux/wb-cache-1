40|$|Abstract. The spindle {{pole body}} (SPB) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{serves as the}} {{centrosome}} in this organism, undergoing duplication early in the cell cycle to generate the two poles of the mitotic spindle. The <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutation</b> ndcl- 1 has previously been shown to cause asymmetric segregation, wherein all the chromosomes go to one pole of the mitotic spindle (Thomas, J. H., and D. Botstein. 1986. Cell. 44 : 65 - 76). Examination by electron microscopy of mutant cells subjected to the nonpermissive temperature reveals a defect in SPB duplication. Although duplication is seen to occur, the nascent SPB fails to undergo insertion into the nuclear envelope. The parental SPB remains functional, organizing a monopolar spindle to which all the chromosomes ar...|$|E

It was shown that these fda(Ts) mutants were severely impaired in rRNA synthesis upon {{shift to the}} restrictive temperature, although the mechanism of inhibition was never determined. Here, we bring resolution to this long-standing question by showing that changes in the concentrations of guanosine 5 ′-diphosphate 3 ′-diphosphate and initiating nucleoside triphosphates can account for the previously observed effects of fda mutations on rRNA transcription...|$|R

We demonstrate that both mutations preferentially inhibit stable RNA synthesis and that this inhibition occurs {{at the level of}} transcription initiation. The susceptibility of a promoter to the inhibitory effects of ts 8 is correlated with the ability of the promoter to be growth rate regulated. This effect is independent of relA and spoT function. Inhibition is dependent upon glucose metabolism past the generation of glucose- 6 -phosphate; however, the mechanism of this effect is unknown...|$|R

We explored the extent of genomic robustness in budding yeast by genome wide dosage suppressor analysis of 53 <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> in cell division cycle and RNA synthesis related genes, revealing 660 suppressor interactions of which 642 are novel. This collection has several distinctive features, including high co-occurrence of mutant-suppressor pairs within protein modules, highly correlated functions between the pairs and higher diversity of functions among the co-suppressors than previously observed. Dosage suppression of essential genes encoding RNA polymerase subunits and chromosome cohesion complex suggests a surprising degree of functional plasticity of macromolecular complexes, and the existence of numerous degenerate pathways for circumventing the effects of potentially <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations.</b> These results imply that organisms and cancer are likely able to exploit the genomic robustness properties, due the persistence of cryptic gene and pathway functions, to generate variation and adapt to selective pressures...|$|R

After a shift to the nonpermissive temperature, many of these clmF mutants failed to complete the segregation of nucleoids into daughter cells; daughter nucleoids appeared incompletely separated and asymmetrically positioned within cells. Some clmF mutants showed instability of F' episomes at permissive growth temperatures yet showed no detectable defect with smaller multicopy plasmids such as pSC 101 or pBR 322. In addition, many of the clmF mutants rapidly lost viability yet continued DNA replication at the nonpermissive temperature.

Recently, a new approach has been proposed for the development of genetic sexing strains in Lepidoptera.

40|$|<b>Conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> are {{valuable}} for analyzing essential genes. We describe here a derivative of the bacterial transposon Tn 5 called Tn 5 tac 1 {{and its use}} in an innovative strategy for making mutations with conditional phenotypes. The 4. 6 -kilobase Tn 5 tac 1 element contains a strong, regulatable, outward-facing promoter (Ptac) near one end and is polar on the expression of distal genes when the inducer of Ptac [isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) ] is absent. Our results show that two unusual conditional mutant phenotypes can result from Tn 5 tac 1 insertion in Escherichia coli: one is corrected by IPTG while the other is induced by IPTG. The broad host range of Tn 5 and the conditional nature of these mutant phenotypes makes Tn 5 tac 1 well suited for identifying essential genes in diverse bacterial species...|$|R

40|$|We {{have found}} that {{temperature}} can have a striking effect upon protein export in Escherichia coli, suggesting {{that there is a}} cold-sensitive step in the protein export pathway. Cs mutations comprise the largest class of mutations affecting the membrane-localized Sec proteins SecD, SecE, SecF and SecY. Although some of these mutations could encode cold-labile proteins, this is unlikely to account for the Cs phenotype of most export mutants, as mutations which simply produce lower amounts of SecE protein have the same phenotype. Certain signal sequence mutations affecting maltose binding protein are also cold sensitive for export. These effects appear to arise by a specific interaction of cold with certain export defects. We believe that the Cs sec mutations are representative of a large class of <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations,</b> whose <b>conditional</b> phenotype reflects an underlying thermal sensitivity of the process in which they are involved...|$|R

40|$|RPL 10 encodes ribosomal protein L 10 (uL 16), {{a highly}} conserved {{multifunctional}} {{component of the}} large ribosomal subunit, involved in ribosome biogenesis and function. Using X-exome resequencing, we identified a novel missense mutation (c. 191 C>T; p. (A 64 V)) in the N-terminal domain of the protein, in a family with two affected cousins presenting with X-linked intellectual disability, cerebellar hypoplasia, and spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia (SED). We assessed {{the impact of the}} mutation on the translational capacity of the cell using yeast as model system. The mutation generates a functional ribosomal protein, able to complement the translational defects of a <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutation</b> of yeast rpl 10. However, unlike previously reported mutations, this novel RPL 10 missense mutation results in an increase in the actively translating ribosome population.

DNA sequencing and RNA blot hybridization studies indicated that the P. aeruginosa accB (fabE) homolog, which encodes BCCP, {{is part of a}} 2 -gene operon that includes accC (fabG), the structural gene for the biotin carboxylase subunit of ACC. P. aeruginosa homologs of the E. coli accA and accD, encoding the alpha and beta subunits of the ACC carboxyltransferase, were identified by hybridization of P. aeruginosa genomic DNA with the E. coli accA and accD. Data are presented which suggest that P. aeruginosa accA and accD homologs are not located either immediately upstream or downstream of the P. aeruginosa accBC operon. In contrast to E. coli, where BCCP is the only biotinylated protein, P. aeruginosa was found to contain at least three biotinylated proteins...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{export of}} proteins through the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli requires chaperones to maintain protein precursors in a translocation-competent conformation. In addition to SecB, the major chaperone facilitating export of particular precursors, heat shock-induced chaperones DnaK-DnaJ and GroEL-GroES are {{also involved in}} this process. By use of secB'-lacZ gene fusions and immunoprecipitation experiments, SecB production was studied in E. coli strains containing <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> in chaperone or sec genes. While the loss of heat shock chaperones resulted in an increased production of SecB, mutations in sec genes showed only minor effects on SecB synthesis. Neither the plasmid-mediated overexpression of precursors of exoproteins nor the overexpression of secB altered the synthesis of SecB. These results suggest that under conditions where chaperones become depleted, E. coli responds by raising the expression of secB. These data confirm the supposed synergy of different chaperones involved in protein export...|$|R
40|$|<b>Conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> mutant systems {{developed}} in T-even bacteriophages T 2, T 4 and T 6 {{have been used}} to study the partial exclusion which characterizes mixed infections of these phages. In bacteria mixedly infected with T 2 and T 4, the dominant phage (T 4) acts against localized exclusion sensitivity determinants in the genome of the excluded phage (T 2). These determinants are clustered near genes controlling early functions; the determinants themselves do not appear among the progeny, but markers located close to them appear infrequently, by recombination. The excluding action of T 4 does not depend on the action of any gene so far identified by <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations,</b> nor does it depend on differences in DNA glucosylation between infecting phages. Regardless of mechanism, the genetic consequence of this partial exclusion is to limit genetic exchange between T 2 and T 4 in the region of the genome controlling early functions, while retaining the capacity for extensive exchange in other regions; in short, partial exclusion constitutes a localized genetic isolating mechanism. Related forms of partial exclusion characterize mixed infections of other T-even phages, including those of some phages newly isolated from nature...|$|R

40|$|Transfer of an allele from a donor DNA to a {{recipient}} DNA molecule {{was selected by}} the loss of a dominant <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutation</b> previously incorporated ito the gene of interest in the recipient DNA. Both the Escherichia coli chromosome and plasmids carrying E. coli genes were used successfully as donor molecules. Recipient molecules for these exchanges were constructed in vitro by using the rpsL gene, which confers sensitivity to streptomycin, to replace segments of specific E. coli genes located either on multicopy plasmids or in the E. coli chromosome. Plasmids carrying such replacements were capable of acquiring chromosomal alleles of the gene(s) of interest, and strains carrying rpsL replacements in the chromosome were capable of acquiring plasmid-encoded alleles {{at the sight of the}} rpsL replacement. In both situations, these allele transfers resulted in loss of the rpsL gene from the recipient DNA molecule. The desired transfer events constituted a large percentage of these events, which gave rise to viable colonies when appropriate donor-recipient pairs were subjected to streptomycin selection. Thus, this is a useful approach for transferring alleles of interest from plasmids to the E. coli chromosome and vice versa...|$|E

Although duplication is seen to occur, the nascent SPB fails to undergo insertion into the nuclear envelope. The parental SPB remains functional, organizing a monopolar spindle to which all the chromosomes are presumably attached. Order-of-function experiments reveal that the NDC 1 function is required in G 1 after alpha-factor arrest but before the arrest caused by cdc 34. Molecular analysis shows that the NDC 1 gene is essential and that it encodes a 656 amino acid protein (74 kD) with six or seven putative transmembrane domains. This evidence for membrane association is further supported by immunofluorescent localization of the NDC 1 product to {{the vicinity of the}} nuclear envelope. These findings suggest that the NDC 1 protein acts within the nuclear envelope to mediate insertion of the nascent SPB. 8349727 PMC 211958...|$|E
40|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) immediate-early protein ICP 27 is {{required}} posttranscriptionally {{for the expression of}} HSV- 1 late genes during a productive infection. ICP 27 also inhibits host cell pre-mRNA splicing, effectively shutting off host cell protein synthesis. Here we describe intragenic suppressors of LG 4, a virus with a <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutation</b> in the gene encoding ICP 27. At the restrictive temperature, tsICP 27 from LG 4 fails to inhibit host cell pre-mRNA splicing and to activate the expression of HSV- 1 late-gene products. Although the suppressors of LG 4 restore virus growth, they still fail to inhibit host cell pre-mRNA splicing. Thus, the role of ICP 27 in the synthesis of late proteins is independent of host shutoff. In HSV- 1 -infected cells, ICP 27 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Shuttling of ICP 27 occurs only at late times during infection. In transfected cells, ICP 27 shuttling was dependent on coexpression of RNA from a late HSV- 1 gene. While shuttling does not occur in cells infected with LG 4 at 39. 5 degrees C, the suppressors of LG 4 restore shuttling. Temperature shift experiments correlate the defect in shuttling with the temperature-sensitive phenotype of LG 4. These data provide a correlation between shuttling of ICP 27 and the expression of HSV- 1 late-gene products. We propose that ICP 27 regulates late-gene protein synthesis by facilitating the export of late RNAs...|$|E
40|$|A new Tn 10 -based {{transposon}} {{has been}} constructed {{and used to}} isolate insertion mutations with tetracy-cline-conditional phenotypes. Classes of mutants include <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations,</b> <b>conditional</b> auxotrophs, and conditional mutants of the eut (ethanolamine utilization) operon. The described mutations were made with a new derivative of Tn 10 dTet that we have called Tn 10 d(T-POP). Others have noted that transposon Tn 10 dTet directs weak tetracycline-inducible transcripts out of {{both ends of the}} element into adjacent sequences. We have increased this level of outward transcription from Tn 10 dTet by selecting deletion mutations within the element that presumably remove transcription-termination signals. Insertion of the Tn 10 d(T-POP) element within an operon disrupts the target gene and makes expression of distal genes dependent on induction of outward transcription by tetracycline. Insertion mutations made with Tn 10 d(T-POP) can cause tetracycline-correctable conditional phenotypes based on expression of distal genes. Transposable elements have been widely used in bacterial genetics. The most commonly used elements are derived from transposon Tn 10 or from bacteriophage Mu (for a review, see reference 19). Insertion of these elements within an operon has an extremely strong polar effect on the expression of gene...|$|R
40|$|The {{approximate}} {{genetic map}} locations of auxotrophic and <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> of Escherichia coli can be rapidly determined with replica plating techniques. A set of patches of 15 streptomycin-sensitive (StrS) Hfr strains with points of origin distributed around the map is replica plated onto a recombinant-selective {{plate with a}} lawn of StrR cells which carry an unmapped mutation. The map interval defined by the Hfr points of origin which are closest to the mutant locus is seen by {{the presence or absence}} of heavy patches of recombinants produced by transfer of early wild-type genes from the Hfrs. An alternative method is to replicate patches of different mutant strains (100 per plate) onto Hfr lawns; in this case more than 1, 000 different mutants can be mapped in a single experiment in a few days. In this way, many types of mutations with similar phenotypes can be grouped as to approximate location on the genetic map. For ordering mutations within groups, the same replica plating methods can be used to cross F-prime derivatives of mutants with other mutants of the same group. Relative merits of these and other mapping methods of E. coli are discussed...|$|R

Measurements of cell growth, viability, and total RNA and protein synthesis showed that rpo 21 - 1, rpo 21 - 2, and rpo 21 - 3 mutations caused a slow shutoff of RNAP II activity in cells shifted to the nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C). Each mutant displayed a distinct phenotype, and one of the mutant enzymes (rpo 21 - 1) was completely deficient in RNAP II activity in vitro. RNAP I and RNAP III in vitro activities were not affected. These results were consistent with the notion that the genetic lesions affect RNAP II assembly or holoenzyme stability. DNA sequencing revealed that in each case the mutations involved nonconservative amino acid substitutions, resulting in charge changes. The lesions harbored by all three rpo 21 Ts- alleles lie in DNA sequence domains that are highly conserved among genes that encode the largest subunits of RNAP from a variety of eucaryotes; one mutation lies in a possible Zn 2 + binding domain...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{cells in}} their native environments must cope with factors that {{compromise}} {{the integrity of the}} cell. The mechanisms of coping with damage in a social or multicellular context are poorly understood. Here we investigated how a model social bacterium, Myxococcus xanthus, approaches this problem. We focused on the social behavior of outer membrane exchange (OME), in which cells transiently fuse and exchange their outer membrane (OM) contents. This behavior requires TraA, a homophilic cell surface receptor that identifies kin based on similarities in a polymorphic region, and the TraB cohort protein. As observed by electron microscopy, TraAB overexpression catalyzed a prefusion OM junction between cells. We then showed that damage sustained by the OM of one population was repaired by OME with a healthy population. Specifically, LPS mutants that were defective in motility and sporulation were rescued by OME with healthy donors. In addition, a mutant with a <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutation</b> in lpxC, an essential gene required for lipid A biosynthesis, was rescued by Tra-dependent interactions with a healthy population. Furthermore, lpxC cells with damaged OMs, which were more susceptible to antibiotics, had resistance conferred to them by OME with healthy donors. We also show that OME has beneficial fitness consequences to all cells. Here, in merged populations of damaged and healthy cells, OME catalyzed a dilution of OM damage, increasing developmental sporulation outcomes of the combined population by allowing it to reach a threshold density. We propose that OME is a mechanism that myxobacteria use to overcome cell damage and to transition to a multicellular organism...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{strains of}} Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells having an assembly-defective beta-tubulin were found among revertants of strain Cmd 4, a mutant with a <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutation</b> in a beta-tubulin gene (F. Cabral, M. E. Sobel, and M. M. Gottesman, Cell 20 : 29 - 36, 1980). The altered beta-tubulins in these strains have electrophoretically silent {{alterations}} or, in some cases, an increase or {{a decrease in}} apparent molecular weight based on their migration in two-dimensional gels. The identity of these variant proteins as beta-tubulin was confirmed by peptide mapping, which also revealed the loss of distinct methionine-containing peptides in the assembly-defective beta-tubulins of lower apparent molecular weight. The altered mobility of these beta-tubulin polypeptides was {{not the result of}} a posttranslational modification, since the altered species could be labeled in very short incubations with [35 S]methionine and were found among in vitro-translated polypeptides by using purified mRNA. In at least one strain, an altered DNA restriction fragment could be demonstrated, suggesting that an alteration occurred in one of the structural genes for beta-tubulin. Assembly-defective beta-tubulin was unstable and turned over with a half-life of only 1 to 2 h in exponentially growing cells. This rapid degradation of a tubulin gene product resulted in approximately 30 % lower steady-state levels of both alpha- and beta-tubulin yet did not affect the growth rate of the cells or the distribution of the microtubules as judged by immunofluorescence microscopy. These results argue that CHO cells possess a beta-tubulin gene product that is not essential for survival...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the signaling pathways through which defense responses are activated following pathogen infection, we have isolated and characterized the cpr 22 mutant. This plant carries a semidominant, <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutation</b> that confers constitutive {{expression of the}} pathogenesisrelated (PR) genes PR- 1, PR- 2, PR- 5 and the defensin gene PDF 1. 2. cpr 22 plants also display spontaneous lesion formation, elevated levels of salicylic acid (SA) and heightened resistance to Peronospora parasitica Emco 5. The cpr 22 locus was mapped to chromosome 2, approximately 2 cM telomeric to the AthB 102 marker. By analyzing the progeny of crosses between cpr 22 plants and either NahG transgenic plants or npr 1 mutants, all of the cpr 22 -associated phenotypes except PDF 1. 2 expression {{were found to be}} SA dependent. However, the SA signal transducer NPR 1 was required only for constitutive PR- 1 expression. A cross between cpr 22 and ndr 1 ± 1 mutants revealed that enhanced resistance to P. parasitica is mediated by an NDR 1 -dependent pathway, while the other cpr 22 -induced defenses are not. Crosses between either coi 1 ± 1 or etr 1 ± 1 mutants further demonstrated that constitutive PDF 1. 2 expression is mediated by a JA- and ethylene-dependent pathway. Based on these results, the cpr 22 mutation appears to induce its associated phenotypes by activating NPR 1 -dependent and NPR 1 independent branches of the SA pathway, as well as an ethylene/JA signaling pathway. Interestingly, the SA-dependent phenotypes, but not the SA-independent phenotypes, are suppressed when cpr 22 mutants are grown under high humidity...|$|E
40|$|The øX 174 DNA pilot protein H {{forms an}} {{oligomeric}} DNA-translocating tube during penetration. However, monomers are in-corporated into 12 pentameric assembly intermediates, which become the capsid’s icosahedral vertices. The protein’s N termi-nus, a predicted transmembrane helix, is not {{represented in the}} crystal structure. To investigate its functions, a series of absolute and <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> were generated. The absolute lethal proteins, a deletion and a triple substitution, were effi-ciently incorporated into virus-like particles lacking infectivity. The <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> mutants, bearing cold-sensitive (cs) and temperature-sensitive (ts) point mutations, were more amenable to further analyses. Viable particles containing the mutant pro-tein can be generated at the permissive temperature and subsequently analyzed at the restrictive temperature. The characterized cs defect directly affected host cell attachment. In contrast, ts defects were manifested during morphogenesis. Particles synthe-sized at permissive temperature were indistinguishable from wild-type particles {{in their ability to}} recognize host cells and deliver DNA. One mutation conferred an atypical ts synthesis phenotype. Although the mutant protein was efficiently incorporated into virus-like particles at elevated temperature, the progeny appeared to be kinetically trapped in a temperature-independent, unin-fectious state. Thus, substitutions in the N terminus can lead to H protein misincorporation, albeit at wild-type levels, and sub-sequently affect particle function. All mutants exhibited recessive phenotypes, i. e., rescued by the presence of the wild-type H protein. Thus, mixed H protein oligomers are functional during DNA delivery. Recessive and dominant phenotypes may tempo-rally approximate H protein functions, occurring before or after oligomerization has gone to completion...|$|R

Here we describe new myo 2 alleles containing <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> in the COOH-terminal tail domain. Within 5 min of shifting to the restrictive temperature, the polarized distribution of secretory vesicles is abolished without affecting the distribution of actin or the mutant Myo 2 p, showing that the tail has a direct role in vesicle targeting. We also show that the actin cable–dependent translocation of Myo 2 p to growth sites does not require secretory vesicle cargo. Although a fusion protein containing the Myo 2 p tail also concentrates at growth sites, this accumulation depends on the polarized delivery of secretory vesicles, implying that the Myo 2 p tail binds to secretory vesicles. Most of the new mutations alter a region of the Myo 2 p tail conserved with vertebrate myosin Vs but divergent from Myo 4 p, the myosin V involved in mRNA transport, and genetic {{data suggest that the}} tail interacts with Smy 1 p, a kinesin homologue, and Sec 4 p, a vesicle-associated Rab protein.

Using acrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with the "immune replicate" technique, we confirmed the positions of gene products 24 and 24 * (P 24 and P 24 *). In this paper we have still used the notation "P 24," etc., for designating the product of gene 23, etc., although we prefer and use in general the designation "gp 23 " as introduced by Casjens and King (Annu. Rev. Biochem. 44 : 585, 1975). The reason for using the old notation is because the illustrations were prepared several years ago.) P 24 ts showed a significantly slower mobility. Both osmotic shock-resistant and -sensitive mature phages contain 24 *. Giants constructed with the Osr phage showed the same surface lattice as normal phage. Through temperature-shift experiments with 24 (tsL 90) alone and in combinations, we studied the phages which are matured after the shift to permissive temperature {{in the absence of}} new protein synthesis. Our results strongly suggest that {{only a fraction of the}} total phage complement of gene 24 -controlled proteins is involved in determining the phenotype of shock resistance, and the remainder is necessary to mature the head...|$|R

Plaque formation by SV 40 tsTNG- 1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) on CV- 1 monolayers occurred normally at 33. 5 C but was grossly inhibited at 38. 7 C. The time at which virus replication was blocked at 38. 7 C was determined by temperature-shift experiments. In shift-up experiments, cultures infected for various times at 33. 5 C were shifted to 38. 7 C. In shift-down experiments, cultures infected for various times at 38. 7 C were shifted to 33. 5 C. All cultures were harvested at 96 hr postinfection (PI). No virus growth occurred when the shift-up occurred before 40 hr PI. Maximum virus yields were obtained at 96 hr PI when the shift-down occurred at 66 hr, but only about 15 % of the maximum yield was obtained when the shift-down occurred at 76 hr PI. These results indicate that SV 40 tsTNG- 1 contains a <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutation</b> in a late viral gene function. Mutant SV 40 tsTNG- 1 synthesized T antigen, viral capsid antigens, and viral DNA, and induced thymidine kinase activity at either 33. 5 or 38. 7 C. The properties of the SV 40 DNA synthesized in mutant-infected CV- 1 cells at 33. 5 or 38. 7 C were {{very similar to those}} of SV 40 DNA made in parental virus-infected cells, as determined by nitrocellulose column chromatography, cesium-chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium centrifugation, and by velocity centrifugation in neutral sucrose gradients. Mutant SV 40 tsTNG- 1 enhanced cellular DNA synthesis in primary cultures of mouse kidney cells at 33. 5 and 38. 7 C and also transformed mouse kidney cultures at 36. 5 C. SV 40 tsTNG- 1 was recovered from clonal lines of transformed cells after fusion with susceptible CV- 1 cells and incubation of heterokaryons at 33. 5 C, but not at 38. 7 C...|$|E
40|$|Phospholipids are {{the major}} {{component}} of cellular membranes. In addition to its structural role, phospholipids play an active and diverse role in cellular processes. The goal {{of this study is}} to identify the genes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis in a model eukaryotic system, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have focused on the biosynthetic steps localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane; hence, the identification of the genes encoding phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD 1), cardiolipin synthase (CLS 1), and phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase (PGS 1). ^ The PSD 1 gene encoding a phosphatidylserine decarboxylase was cloned by complementation of a <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutation</b> in the homologous gene in Escherichia coli strain EH 150. Overexpression of the PSD 1 gene in wild type yeast resulted in 20 -fold amplification of phosphatidylserine decarboxylase activity. Disruption of the PSD 1 gene resulted in 20 -fold reduction of decarboxylase activity, but the PSD 1 null mutant exhibited essentially normal phenotype. These results suggest that yeast has a second phosphatidylserine decarboxylation activity. ^ Cardiolipin is the major anionic phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is thought to be an essential component of many biochemical functions. In eukaryotic cells, cardiolipin synthase catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of cardiolipin from phosphatidylglycerol and CDP-diacylglycerol. We have cloned the gene CLS 1. Overexpression of the CLS 1 gene product resulted in significantly elevated cardiolipin synthase activity, and disruption of the CLS 1 gene, confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis, resulted in a null mutant that was viable and showed no petite phenotype. However, phospholipid analysis showed undetectable cardiolipin level and an accumulation of phosphatidylglycerol. These results support the conclusion that CLS 1 encodes the cardiolipin synthase of yeast and that normal levels of cardiolipin are not absolutely essential for survival of the cell. ^ Phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) synthase catalyzes the synthesis of PGP from CDP-diacylglycerol and glycerol- 3 -phosphate and functions as the committal and rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of cardiolipin. We have identified the PGS 1 gene as encoding the PGP synthase. Overexpression of the PGS 1 gene product resulted in over 15 -fold increase in in vitro PGP synthase activity. Disruption of the PGS 1 gene in a haploid strain of yeast, confirmed by Southern blot analysis, resulted in a null mutant strain that was viable but had significantly altered phenotypes, i. e. inability to grow on glycerol and at 37 ∘C. These cells showed over a 10 -fold decrease in PGP synthase activity and a decrease in both phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin levels. These results support the conclusion that PGS 1 encodes the PGP synthase of yeast and that neither phosphatidylglycerol nor cardiolipin are absolutely essential for survival of the cell. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. MYO 2 encodes a type V myosin {{heavy chain}} {{needed for the}} {{targeting}} of vacuoles and secretory vesicles to the growing bud of yeast. Here we describe new myo 2 alleles containing <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> in the COOH-terminal tail domain. Within 5 min of shifting to the restrictive temperature, the polarized distribution of secretory vesicles is abolished without affecting the distribution of actin or the mutant Myo 2 p, showing that the tail has a direct role in vesicle targeting. We also show that the actin cable–dependent translocation of Myo 2 p to growth sites does not require secretory vesicle cargo. Although a fusion protein containing the Myo 2 p tail also concentrates at growth sites, this accumulation depends on the polarized delivery of secretory vesicles, implying that the Myo 2 p tail binds to secretory vesicles. Most of the new mutations alter a region of the Myo 2 p tail conserved with vertebrate myosin Vs but divergent from Myo 4 p, the myosin V involved in mRNA transport, and genetic {{data suggest that the}} tail interacts with Smy 1 p, a kinesin homologue, and Sec 4 p, a vesicle-associated Rab protein. The data support a model in which the Myo 2 p tail tethers secretory vesicles, and the motor transports them down polarized actin cables to the site of exocytosis. Key words: cell polarity • myosin V • MYO 2 gene product • exocytosis • Saccharomyces cerevisia...|$|R
40|$|The sec/prl gene {{products}} catalyze the translocation of precursor proteins {{from the}} cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Recessive, {{conditionally lethal mutant}} alleles of these genes (sec mutations) cause a generalized defect in protein secretion; dominant suppressor mutant alleles (prl mutations) restore export of precursor proteins with altered signal sequences. In prl strains, a precursor protein with a defective signal sequence can be selectively targeted to the suppressor gene product. When a precursor LacZ hybrid protein is used, the targeted prl protein is inactivated by the large, toxic hybrid molecule, a result termed suppressor-directed inactivation (SDI). Using SDI, two different secretion-related complexes can be generated: a pretranslocation complex that contains a hybrid protein with an unprocessed signal sequence, and a translocation complex in which the hybrid protein is jammed in transmembrane orientation with the signal sequence cleaved. Additional Sec proteins that are contained within, and thus sequestered by, each of these complexes can be identified when their functional levels are lowered using the <b>conditional</b> <b>lethal</b> sec <b>mutations.</b> Results of this genetic analysis suggest a multistep pathway for protein secretion in which the translocation machinery assembles on demand...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} role of {{eukaryotic}} DNA primase in vivo, we have produced <b>conditional</b> and <b>lethal</b> point <b>mutations</b> by random in vitro mutagenesis of the PR 11 and PR 12 genes, which encode the small and large subunits of yeast DNA primase. We replaced the wild-type copies of PRI 1 and PRI 2 with two pri 1 and two pri 2 conditional alleles. When shifted to the restrictive temperature, these strains showed altered DNA synthesis and reduced ability to synthesize high molecular weight DNA products, thus providing in vivo evidence for the essential role of DNA primase in eukaryotic DNA replication. Furthermore, mapping of the mutations at the nucleotide level {{has shown that the}} two pri 1 and two pri 2 conditional alleles and one pri 2 lethal allele have suffered single base-pair substitutions causing a change in amino acid residues conserved in the corresponding mouse polypeptide...|$|R
40|$|Yeast {{and human}} Clp 1 {{proteins}} are homologous {{components of the}} mRNA 3 ′-cleavage-polyadenylation machinery. Recent studies highlighting an association of human Clp 1 (hClp 1) with tRNA splicing endonuclease and an intrinsic RNA-specific 5 ′-OH polynucleotide kinase activity of hClp 1 have prompted speculation that Clp 1 might play a catalytic role in tRNA splicing in animal cells. Here, we show that expression of hClp 1 in budding yeast can complement <b>conditional</b> and <b>lethal</b> <b>mutations</b> in the essential 5 ′-OH RNA kinase module of yeast or plant tRNA ligases. The tRNA splicing activity of hClp 1 in yeast is abolished by mutations in the kinase active site. In contrast, overexpression of yeast Clp 1 (yClp 1) cannot rescue kinase-defective tRNA ligase mutants, and, unlike hClp 1, the purified recombinant yClp 1 protein has no detectable RNA kinase activity in vitro. Mutations of the yClp 1 ATP-binding site do not affect yeast viability. These findings, {{and the fact that}} hClp 1 cannot complement growth of a yeast clp 1 Δ strain, indicate that yeast and human Clp 1 proteins are not functional orthologs, despite their structural similarity. Although hClp 1 can perform the 5 ′-end-healing step of a yeast-type tRNA splicing pathway in vivo, it is uncertain whether its kinase activity is necessary for tRNA splicing in human cells, given that other mammalian counterparts of yeast-type tRNA repair enzymes are nonessential in vivo...|$|R
