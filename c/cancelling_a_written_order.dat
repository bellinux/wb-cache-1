2500|$|Browning countered Irving's {{argument}} {{that the lack of}} <b>a</b> <b>written</b> Führer <b>order</b> proves the alleged non-occurrence of the Holocaust by arguing that although no such <b>order</b> was ever <b>written</b> down, Hitler had almost certainly made statements to his leading subordinates indicating his wishes in regards to the Jews of Europe during the war, thus rendering the need for <b>a</b> <b>written</b> <b>order</b> irrelevant. Browning testified that several leading experts on Nazi Germany believe that there was no <b>written</b> Führer <b>order</b> for the [...] "Final Solution of the Jewish Question", but no historian doubts the reality of the Holocaust. Browning went on to assert that Irving was attempting to falsely equate doubts about the existence of <b>a</b> <b>written</b> Führer <b>order</b> with doubts about the Holocaust. Browning used to support his thesis the example of Hitler's secret speech to his Gauleiters on 12 December 1941, in which Hitler strongly alluded to genocide as the [...] "Final Solution".|$|R
