25|$|The young polemicist persevered in {{supporting}} this anti-establishment cause, moving on from L'Indépendance Roumaine {{to the newly}} established publication România Jună, interrupting himself for trips to Italy, the Netherlands and Galicia-Lodomeria. In 1900, he collected the scattered polemical articles into the French-language books Opinions sincères. La vie intellectuelle des roumains en 1899 ("Honest Opinions. The Romanians' Intellectual Life in 1899") and Opinions pérnicieuses d'un mauvais patriote ("The Pernicious Opinions of a Bad Patriot"). His scholarly activities resulted in a second trip into Transylvania, a second portion of his Bistrița archives collection, the 11th Hurmuzachi volume, and two works on early modern Romanian history: Acte din secolul al XVI-lea relative la Petru Șchiopul ("16th Century Acts Relating to Peter the Lame") and Scurtă istorie a lui Mihai Viteazul ("A Short History of Michael the Brave"). His controversial public attitude had nevertheless attracted an official ban on his Academy reports, and also meant that he was ruled out from the national Academy prize (for which distinction he had submitted Documente românești din arhivele Bistriței).

For these experiments, plants were chilled (5 °C) for different lengths of time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark or light. Following a 1 hour recovery period at 25 °C, photosynthetic activity was measured by gas exchange (CO 2 uptake and H 2 O release), quantum yield, and induced chlorophyll fluorescence. The results show that pea photosynthesis was largely unaffected by two consecutive nights of <b>chilling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, or by chilling during a complete light and dark cycle (15 hours/ 9 hours). Cucumber gas exchange was reduced by one night of chilling, but its quantum yield and variable fluorescence were unaffected by dark chilling.

To further investigate {{the site of the}} differential response of these two species to chilling stress, thylakoid membranes were isolated under various conditions and rates of photosynthetic electron transfer were determined. Preliminary experiments revealed that the integrity of cucumber thylakoids from 25 °C-grown plants was affected by the isolation temperature; cucumber thylakoids isolated at 5 °C in 400 millimolar NaCl were uncoupled, while thylakoids isolated at room temperature in 400 millimolar NaCl were coupled, as determined by addition of gramicidin. The concentration of NaCl <b>in</b> <b>the</b> homogenization buffer was found to be a critical factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> uncoupling of cucumber thylakoids at 5 °C. In contrast, pea thylakoid membranes were not influenced by isolation temperatures or NaCl concentrations. In a second set of experiments, thylakoid membranes were isolated from pea and cucumber plants at successive intervals during a whole-plant light period chilling stress (5 °C). During wholeplant chilling, thylakoids isolated from cucumber plants <b>chilled</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light were uncoupled even when the membranes were isolated at warm temperatures.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{response}} of <b>in</b> situ photophosphorylation in attached cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. cv Ashley) leaves to chilling under strong illumination was investigated. A single-beam kinetic spectrophotometer {{fitted with a}} clamp-on, whole leaf cuvette {{was used to measure}} the flash-induced electrochromic absorbance change at 518 minus 540 nanometers (ΔA 518 − 540) <b>in</b> attached leaves. <b>The</b> relaxation kinetics of the electric field-indicating ΔA 518 − 540 measures the rate of depolarization of the thylakoid membrane. Since this depolarization process is normally dominated by proton efflux through the coupling factor during ATP synthesis, this technique can be used, in conjuction with careful controls, as a monitor of in situ ATP formation competence. Whole, attached leaves were chilled at 5 °C and 1000 microeinsteins per square meter per second for up to 6 hours then rewarmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark at room temperature for 30 minutes and 100 % relative humidity. Leaf water potential, chlorophyll content, and the effective optical pathlength for the absorption measurements were not affected by the treatment. Light- and CO 2 -saturated leaf disc oxygen evolution and the quantum efficiency of photosynthesis were inhibited by approximately 50 % after 3 hours of light chilling and by approximately 75 % after 6 hours. Despite the large inhibition to net photosynthesis, the measurements of ΔA 518 − 540 relaxation kinetics showed photophosphorylation to be largely unaffected by the chilling and light exposure. The amplitude of the ΔA 518 - 540 measures the degree of energization of the photosynthetic membranes and was reduced significantly by <b>chilling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light. The cause of the decreased energization was traced to impaired turnover of photosystem II. Our measurements showed that the chilling of whole leaves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light caused neither an uncoupling of photophosphorylation from photosynthetic electron transport nor any irreversible inhibition of the chloroplast coupling factor <b>in</b> situ. <b>The</b> sizeable inhibition <b>in</b> net photosynthesis observed after <b>chilling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light cannot, therefore, be attributed to any direct effect on photophosphorylation competence...|$|R
