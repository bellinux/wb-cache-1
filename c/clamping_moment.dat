40|$|The {{purpose of}} the edge beam is to support the railing and the pavement, {{function}} {{as part of the}} drainage system and in the case it is integrated into the bridge deck it can serve to distribute concentrated loads. It is located in road environment and therefore exposed to water and salt with chlorides as well as subject to impacts during accidents. It deteriorates in a greater pace {{than the rest of the}} bridge and therefore has a shorter lifespan than the bridge in full. A deteriorated edge beam put the safety of the bridge users in jeopardize and increases the need of maintenance, repair and replacement work. These activities affect the surrounding traffic flow due to reduced speed limits as well as closure of traffic lanes. A literature study has been performed to get an understanding of how edge beams are designed and constructed. A great part of this was done by examining codes and regulations. By meeting engineers from different building companies it has been possible to obtain a picture of how it is done in real life and how the path to the final design looks like. Building site visits were carried out to see the process from design to construction i. e. how it is applied in real life. A design study was performed, including a check of crack width in an integrated edge beam over a support, height of bridge deck when a pre-fabricated (brokappa) is used and a comparison in the magnitude of the <b>clamping</b> <b>moment</b> in a steel-concrete bridge with and without an edge beam. All proposals are presented by the Edge Beam Group (EBG, in Swedish, Kantbalksgruppen), which is composed of experienced engineers that works within the frame of the project social optimal edge beam systems governed by the Swedish Transport Administration. The literature research showed that even if the edge bean is prone to deteriorate its lifespan does not have to be governed by its condition. Planned expansion of bridge width and maintenance strategies including the replacement of waterproofing layer could also be a reason for replacement in some cases. A significant increase of reinforcement in the edge beam and top part of the bridge deck over support is needed to obtain an acceptable crack width of 0. 15 mm. This would however aggravate the casting phase. The use of a pre-fabricated edge beam result in an increase of the bridge deck height. A solution could be to strengthen the anchoring capacity but this could in turn give an over reinforced structure. When it comes to the <b>clamping</b> <b>moment</b> in a steelconcrete composite bridge the integrated edge beam leads to a better distribution of the traffic load. On the other hand, due to the higher dead weight, a bridge deck without an edge beam would result in a lower total moment in the cantilever...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. When {{blood flow}} is decreased, as in {{prolonged}} hypovolaemia and hypotension, {{or in the}} course of transversal clamping of the aorta during aortic reconstruction, nutritive tissue perfusion can also fall below the critical level. Aim. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyse the effects of hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution on cardiovascular function during reconstruction of the abdominal aorta. Method. This prospective randomised study included 40 patients. All patients underwent surgery of the abdominal aorta under general endotracheal anaesthesia. Based on the type of solution infused from the time of <b>clamping</b> to the <b>moment</b> of the removal of the transversal aortic clamp, the patients were divided into two groups of 20. The study group was infused with a small volume of hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution, while the controls were administered infusions of isotonic solution. Patients with a preoperative creatinine level over 130 μmol L- 1 and an ejection fraction of less than 40 % were excluded from the study. Results. Cardiac output increased from 5. 67 ± 2. 95 to 7. 05 ± 3. 39 L min- 1 in the study group, in comparison to the controls, where it increased from 4. 98 ± 2. 06 to 5. 99 ± 3. 02 L min- 1 (p= 0. 004). Central venous pressure increased from 8. 75 ± 3. 67 to 9. 30 ± 2. 77 mm Hg in the study group, in comparison to the controls, where the values decreased from 6. 84 ± 2. 73 to 6. 45 ± 2. 50 mm Hg (p= 0. 022). Diastolic pulmonary artery pressure increased from 15. 92 ± 5. 61 to 16. 65 ± 6. 53 mm Hg in the study group, in comparison to the controls, where it decreased from 12. 65 ± 4. 28 to 11. 85 ± 3. 91 mm Hg (p= 0. 021). The amount of given crystalloids 24 hours after the removal of the aortic clamp totalled 2562. 5 ± 485. 82 mL in the study group, versus 3350 ± 727. 29 mL in the control group (p= 0. 000). The amount of given human albumins 24 hours after the removal of the aortic clamp totalled 30 ± 49. 74 mL in the study group versus 100 ± 4. 34 mL in the control group (p= 0. 001). Conclusion. Haemodynamic stability of patients and adequate organ perfusion during surgery are achieved through the infusion of hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution, which maintains optimal values of: cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and delivery of oxygen, while reducing alveolo-arterial oxygen difference. The balance of fluids, 24 hours after the removal of the aortic clamp, was maintained with the aid of hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution, while isotonic solution produced an excess of over 1000 mL of fluid in the control patients. Hypertonic-hyperoncotic solution increases cardiac output considerably more than does isotonic solution, and its application significantly reduces the accumulation of crystalloid solutions and human albumins...|$|R
