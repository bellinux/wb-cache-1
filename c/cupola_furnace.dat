5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached {{the bottom of the}} furnace.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process.|$|E

5|$|Blast furnace: Although {{cast iron}} tools and weapons {{have been found}} in China dating to the 5th century BC, the {{earliest}} discovered Chinese blast furnaces, which produced pig iron that could be remelted and refined as cast iron in the <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace,</b> date to the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, while the vast majority of early blast furnace sites discovered date to the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) period immediately following 117 BC with the establishment of state monopolies over the salt and iron industries during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141– 87 BC); most ironwork sites discovered dating before 117 BC acted merely as foundries which made castings for iron that had been smelted in blast furnaces elsewhere in remote areas far from population centres.|$|E
5|$|Cupola furnace: American {{anthropologist}} Vincent C. Pigott of the University of Pennsylvania {{states that}} the <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> existed in China at least by the Warring States period (403–221 BC), while Donald B. Wagner writes that some iron ore melted in the blast furnace may have been cast directly into molds, but most, if not all, iron smelted in the blast furnace during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) was remelted in a cupola furnace; it was designed so that a cold blast injected at the bottom traveled through tuyere pipes across the top where the charge (i.e. of charcoal and scrap or pig iron) was dumped, the air becoming a hot blast before reaching {{the bottom of the}} furnace where the iron was melted and then drained into appropriate molds for casting.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was long}} thought that the Chinese had {{developed}} the blast furnace and cast iron as their first method of iron production, Donald Wagner (the author of the above referenced study) has published a more recent paper that supersedes some of the statements in the earlier work; the newer paper still places {{the date of the}} first cast-iron artifacts at the 5th and 4th centuries BC, but also provides evidence of earlier bloomery furnace use, which migrated from China to Western parts and Central Asia during the beginning of the Chinese Bronze Age of the late Longshan culture (2000BC). He suggests that early blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt bronze. Certainly, though, iron was essential to military success by the time the State of Qin had unified China (221BC). Usage of the blast and <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> remained widespread during the Song and Tang Dynasties. By the 11th century AD, the Song Dynasty Chinese iron industry made a remarkable switch of resources from charcoal to bituminous coal in casting iron and steel, sparing thousands of acres of woodland from felling. This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} region {{now known}} as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. By the Warring States period (403–221 BC), inhabitants of the Warring States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace,</b> while the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.|$|E

50|$|A railway from Teliuc to Călan {{was built}} in 1875 because horses were unable to deliver enough raw {{materials}} to meet the factory's needs. The railway, a 16.5-km section of narrow gauge track, was used by steam locomotives. The foundry was begun in 1876 and incorporated parts brought from the Rușchița factory. In 1877, the room for moulding and casting was completed, as were the cleaning unit and warehouse for cast objects, and the <b>cupola</b> <b>furnaces</b> began running.|$|R
500|$|Although Chinese civilization {{lacked the}} bloomery, the Han Chinese {{were able to}} make wrought iron when they {{injected}} too much oxygen into the <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace,</b> causing decarburization. The Han-era Chinese were also able to convert cast iron and pig iron into wrought iron and steel by using the finery forge and puddling process, the earliest specimens of such dating to the 2nd century BCE and found at Tieshengguo near Mount Song of Henan province. The semisubterranean walls of these furnaces were lined with refractory bricks and had bottoms made of refractory clay. Besides charcoal made of wood, Wang Zhongshu states that another furnace fuel used during the Han were [...] "coal cakes", a mixture of coal powder, clay, and quartz.|$|E
500|$|There {{were great}} {{innovations}} in metallurgy. In addition to Zhou-dynasty China's (c. 1050 BCE– 256 BCE) previous inventions {{of the blast}} furnace and <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace</b> to make [...] pig iron and cast iron, respectively, the Han period saw the development of steel and wrought iron by use of the finery forge and puddling process. With the drilling of deep boreholes into the earth, the Chinese used not only derricks to lift brine {{up to the surface}} to be boiled into salt, but also set up bamboo-crafted pipeline transport systems which brought natural gas as fuel to the furnaces. Smelting techniques were enhanced with inventions such as the waterwheel-powered bellows; the resulting widespread distribution of iron tools facilitated the growth of agriculture. For tilling the soil and planting straight rows of crops, the improved heavy-moldboard plough with three iron plowshares and sturdy multiple-tube iron seed drill were invented in the Han, which greatly enhanced production yields and thus sustained population growth. The method of supplying irrigation ditches with water was improved with the invention of the mechanical chain pump powered by the rotation of a waterwheel or draft animals, which could transport irrigation water up elevated terrains. The waterwheel was also used for operating trip hammers in pounding grain and in rotating the metal rings of the mechanical-driven astronomical armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere around the Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Finely ground {{bituminous}} coal, {{known in}} this application as sea coal, is a constituent of foundry sand. While the molten metal {{is in the}} mould, the coal burns slowly, releasing reducing gases at pressure, and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand. It is also contained in 'mould wash', a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting. Sea coal can be mixed with the clay lining (the [...] "bod") used for {{the bottom of a}} <b>cupola</b> <b>furnace.</b> When heated, the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable, easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal.|$|E

50|$|Several {{specialised}} furnaces {{are used}} to heat the metal. Furnaces are refractory-lined vessels that contain the material to be melted and provide the energy to melt it. Modern furnace types include electric arc furnaces (EAF), induction <b>furnaces,</b> <b>cupolas,</b> reverberatory, and crucible furnaces. Furnace choice {{is dependent on the}} alloy system quantities produced. For ferrous materials EAFs, <b>cupolas,</b> and induction <b>furnaces</b> are commonly used. Reverberatory and crucible furnaces are common for producing aluminium, bronze, and brass castings.|$|R
50|$|The new factory, {{initially}} {{located at}} the intersection of Czerniakowska and Rozbrat Streets in Warsaw's borough of Czerniaków, in what was to become the Czerniaków Port, was among the most modern foundries in the Kingdom of Poland. The area was chosen both for its proximity to the port and the principal client, and for easy availability of workers, many of whom lived in nearby areas of Warsaw. The factory was equipped with a modern steam engine powering the fans of two <b>cupola</b> <b>furnaces,</b> while the steam in the engine was heated by the furnaces themselves. In addition, the steam engine also powered a turnery and several other mechanisms. The fuel was provided by six coke furnaces installed on the premises. In 1860 the factory had a crew of roughly 100 workers and produced all types of cast iron, copper and brass products, from agricultural machinery, through iron piping and weights, to machinery for wood, food and paper industries.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of foundries specialize {{in a particular}} metal and have furnaces dedicated to these metals. For example, an iron foundry (for cast iron) may use a <b>cupola,</b> induction <b>furnace,</b> or EAF, while a steel foundry will use an EAF or induction furnace. Bronze or brass foundries use crucible furnaces or induction furnaces. Most aluminium foundries use either electric resistance or gas heated crucible furnaces or reverberatory furnaces.|$|R

50|$|In 1867, the {{administration}} of the Brașov Mining and Metallurgy Company (Kronstädter Bergbau- und Hüttenvereins-Komplexes), headed by Prince Maximilian Egon I of Fürstenberg, purchased land for a steel works. The land, covering some 104 ha including swamps, came from the wife of a Hungarian nobleman. In 1868, German engineer Otto Gmelin was hired to draw up plans for the new enterprise. The decision to build at Călan was closely related to the fact that a railway line was being laid between Simeria and Petroșani, and work intensified at Călan once this line was complete. The first furnace was built starting on May 25, 1869 by the Brașov company, which also held the Teliuc mine. Inaugurated in the winter of 1871, it had a capacity of 82 m3. The second furnace started being built in 1874 and went operational the following year. Josef Massenez, a Belgian, supervised the construction work. Ore and dolomite used in production came straight from Teliuc. A foundry was begun in 1876, with two <b>cupola</b> <b>furnaces</b> added the following year.|$|R

5|$|Finery forge: In {{addition}} to accidental lumps of low-carbon wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in Chinese <b>cupola</b> <b>furnaces,</b> the ancient Chinese also created wrought iron {{by using the}} finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), {{due to the fact}} that there are wrought iron items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the bloomery ever being used in China. The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in {{addition to}} the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text Taiping Jing.|$|R
