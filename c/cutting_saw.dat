5000|$|Cold {{saw blades}} are {{circular}} metal <b>cutting</b> <b>saw</b> blades categorized into two types: solid HSS or tungsten carbide-tipped (TCT). Both types of blades are resharpenable {{and may be}} used many times before being discarded. Cold saw blades are used to cut metal using a relatively slow rotational speed, usually less than 5000 surface feet per minute (SFM) (25m/s), and a high chip load per tooth, usually between [...]001" [...] - [...]003" [...] (0.025 - 0.08mm) per tooth. These blades are driven by a high power motor and high-torque gear reduction unit or an AC vector drive. During the cutting process, the metal is released in a shearing action by the teeth as the blade turns and the feed mechanism moves the blade forward. They are called [...] "cold saw blades" [...] because they transfer all the energy and heat created during the cutting process to the chip. This enables the blade and the work material to remain cold.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{automatic}} cutting-off machines, of metallic pipes or bars, use {{a constant}} cutting velocity mode. This mode of operation, constant cutting velocity combined with different profiles of materials to be cut, exposes the <b>cutting</b> <b>saw</b> to variable cutting forces. Therefore, the {{cutting off machine}} is usually set for the worst expected conditions, otherwise excessive wear of the saw and machine will occur. Further, traditional cutting-off machines require the adjustment {{of the position of}} a limit switch in order to automatically detect when the cut of a piece has been completed. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the application of control algorithms to the process of cutting-off metallic pipes or bars, with variable profiles, implemented in an industrial cutting-off machine, commercially available. The presented algorithms concern realtime cutting control and automatic detection of the cutting end. The algorithms are implemented in a low cost Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), allowing its use in industrial applications without significant increase on machine cost. All algorithms were developed having in mind safety issues relative to the operation of the cutting machine in order to prevent catastrophic failure.

40|$|Many {{manufacturers}} who cut metal use {{plasma arc}} cutting {{as part of}} their manufacturing process. Plasma cutters use electricity and pressurized gas to produce a temperature of up to 50, 000 ºF at the cutting tip. These plasma cutters can rapidly cut through metals as much as 12 inches thick. The use of computer numerical controlled (CNC) plasma cutters allow manufacturers to rapidly cut even very intricate and detailed flat parts. This process is a tremendous improvement over traditional torch <b>cutting,</b> <b>saw</b> cutting, or other machining processes for producing near net shapes. It is faster and less expensive than most of the alternative processes available. There are several processing and quality factors that must be addressed when using a plasma cutter. The most common problem with plasma cutting is the formation of dross (resolidified metal) on the cut edge. The formation of dross on plasma-cut parts creates several problems in the manufacturing process. By carefully controlling the operating parameters, the formation of dross on the work piece can be minimized, which greatly increases the quality of the part and the efficiency of the production process. Efficient operation of a CNC plasma cutter to minimize the formation of dross requires controlling several variables in the process. These variables include: material type and thickness, arc current (amperage), cutting speed, cutting-gas pressure, cutting tip size, and the gap between the cutting tip and the work piece. Experience with plasma arc cutting and research on the subject reveals that the variables that most affect the formation of dross are arc current, cutting speed, material thickness, and nozzle size. A study involving these four variables will be performed to determine the optimum setup for the CNC plasma cutter to minimize the formation of dross. Michael E.

The thesis covers the problems of oscillation of circular saw blades as when idling and operating - the cutting process; and by the use of three circular saw blades with different construction modifications. These aforementioned construction measures are also compared to each other due to the implementation of standard construction saw blades not only from the perspective of oscillation, but also {{from the perspective of the}} roughness of the machined surface and the analysis of wood waste generated during cutting and noise. In the theoretical part there is an analysis of available literature and scientific theses. It outlines the particular publications devoted to methods of determining the shapes of oscillation, determining critical, resonant and recommended speed, blade constructions, including possible modifications, the theory of <b>cutting</b> <b>saw</b> blades including determining the size and shape of the splints and the effects of noise on the work environment.

40|$|Prolonged, {{extensive}} {{exposure to}} hand-transmitted vibration {{could cause a}} series of vibration-induced disorders in the vascular, sensorineural, and musculoskeletal structures of the human hand-arm system, which have been collectively called hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). 1 To assess the risk of HAVS the international standard ISO 5349 - 1 (2001) 1 recommends using the root-mean-square (rms) acceleration of the measured vibration with a frequency weighting. While a few epidemiological studies have reported results consistent with the predictions made according to the recommendation, many other studies have reported results with large discrepancies. 2 This may be partially attributed to the time-averaging effect involved in calculation of the frequency components, especially for impact type tools. Because the spectral characteristics of impact tools change dramatically with time, a time-frequency (T-F) analysis can provide better characterizations of such highly transient vibrations. The analytic wavelet transform (AWT) is an ideal T-F analysis tool because it possesses the advantages of both the Fourier transform and the wavelet transform. 3 The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the application of the AWT method for characterizing the impact tool vibrations and assessing their exposure risk. Methods Five tools (two chipping hammers, two riveting hammers, and one concrete <b>cutting</b> <b>saw)</b> were used in this study. The saw vibration was measured when it was used to cut a section of road pavement during a repair. The vibrations on the other tools were measured by the procedure specified in ISO 8662 - 2 (1992). 4 A sampling rate of 16, 386 Hz was used in the measurement. The AWT and Fourier analysis were applied to these signals and to identify their characteristics. Results Figure 1 compares the T-F characteristics of the accelerations measured from the relatively steady concrete saw and a riveting hammer. The frequency weighting specified in ISO 5349 - 11 was applied in the calculations. The comparison clearly shows that the two tools have completely different T-F characteristics...|$|E
