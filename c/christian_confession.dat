50|$|Although {{normally}} {{administered in}} conjunction with baptism, in some cases chrismation alone {{may be used to}} receive converts to Orthodoxy through the exercise of economia. Although practice in this regard varies, in general, if a convert comes to Orthodoxy from another <b>Christian</b> <b>confession</b> and has previously undergone a rite of baptism in the Trinitarian Formula ("in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit"), he or she may be received into the Orthodox Church through the sacrament of chrismation, after which receiving the Holy Eucharist. If, however, a convert comes from a <b>Christian</b> <b>confession</b> that baptizes in the name of Jesus (such as Oneness Pentecostals), from one which practices an invalid, non-Trinitarian baptism (such as Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses) or from one that does not practice baptism at all (such as Quakers or The Salvation Army), baptism is a prerequisite for chrismation—an initiate must always be validly baptized into the death of Jesus {{in the name of the}} Holy Trinity before any further holy mysteries or sacraments of initiation can be administered. The use of economia is at the discretion of, and subject to the guidelines imposed by, the local bishop. Converts from non-Christian religions also need to be baptized before chrismation.|$|E
50|$|The Catholic Church of Austria, {{also known}} as the Roman-Catholic Church of Austria, is part of the {{worldwide}} Catholic Church in full communion with the Pope in Rome. The Church's governing body in Austria is the Austrian Conference of Catholic Bishops, made up of the hierarchy of the two archbishops (Vienna and Salzburg), the bishops and the abbot of territorial abbey of Wettingen-Mehrerau. Nevertheless, each bishop is independent in his own diocese, answerable only to the Pope. The current president of the Conference of Catholic Bishops is Cardinal Christoph Schönborn. The Austrian church is the largest <b>Christian</b> <b>Confession</b> of Austria, with 5.16 million members (58.8 % of the total Austrian population.).|$|E

5000|$|Other {{opponents of}} the Sinner's Prayer point out that no classic <b>Christian</b> <b>confession</b> of faith from any evangelical {{denomination}} in Christendom affirms that one must say the Sinner's Prayer to be saved; on the contrary, Baptist, Presbyterian and other Reformed, and other evangelical groups unanimously teach justification by faith alone. They argue that the Sinner's Prayer is a modern deviation from orthodox evangelicalism [...] and a deviation from classic evangelical methods of evangelism.The Sinner's Prayer was not practiced before the 1700s. Therefore, {{to say that it}} is the way to be saved is to say that prior to the 1700s no one was saved.|$|E
5000|$|A famous {{idiosyncratic}} atheist {{belief is}} that of Thomas J. J. Altizer. His book The Gospel of Christian Atheism (1967) proclaims the highly unusual view that God has literally died, or self-annihilated. According to Altizer, this is nevertheless [...] "a <b>Christian</b> <b>confession</b> of faith". Making clear the difference between his position and that of both Nietzsche's notion {{of the death of}} God and the stance of theological non-realists, Altizer says, [...] "To confess the death of God is to speak of an actual and real event, not perhaps an event occurring in a single moment of time or history, but notwithstanding this reservation an event that has actually happened both in a cosmic and in a historical sense." ...|$|E

5000|$|Transylvania was now {{beyond the}} reach of Catholic {{religious}} authority, allowing Lutheran and Calvinist preaching to flourish. In 1563, Giorgio Blandrata was appointed as court physician, and his radical religious ideas increasingly influenced both the young king John II and the Calvinist bishop Francis David, eventually converting both to the Anti-Trinitarian (Unitarian) creed. In a formal public disputation, Francis David prevailed over the Calvinist Peter Melius; resulting in 1568 in the formal adoption of individual freedom of religious expression under the Edict of Torda (the first such legal guarantee of religious freedom in Christian Europe, however only for Lutherans, Calvinists, Unitarians and of course Catholics, with the Orthodox <b>Christian</b> <b>confession</b> being [...] "tolerated", with no legal guarantees granted).|$|E
50|$|None of the {{characters}} in this novel has a connection to or affinity for the Christian religion. Neither Blanche nor her parents nor Christa are practicing Christians. Nonetheless they use Christian metaphors, parables and symbols, e.g. the Parable of the Prodigal Son, the Epiphany, Antichrist, Apocalypse, Kiss of Judas, and Crucifixion. The references and parallels to <b>Christian</b> <b>confession</b> have lost their religious meaning in this novel and are associated with a negative connotation: Christa recklessly exploits the Parable of the Prodigal Son to distinguish herself. The Epiphany is debased to a farce. Christa is labeled ″Antichrista″ by Blanche because of her vicious intrigues. Christa′s satanic manipulations within the microcosm of the Hast family reaches an apocalyptic scale. The Kiss of Judas aids uncovering Christa′s maliciousness. The Crucifixion serves as an illustration for Blanche′s inner disunity.|$|E
50|$|Practice in the Eastern Orthodox Church for {{converts}} {{from other}} communions is not uniform. However, generally baptisms {{performed in the}} name of the Holy Trinity are accepted by the Orthodox Christian Church. If a convert has not received the sacrament (mysterion) of baptism, he or she must be baptised {{in the name of}} the Holy Trinity before they may enter into communion with the Orthodox Church. If he has been baptized in another <b>Christian</b> <b>confession</b> (other than Orthodox Christianity) his previous baptism is considered retroactively filled with grace by chrismation or, in rare circumstances, confession of faith alone as long as the baptism was done {{in the name of the}} Holy Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). The exact procedure is dependent on local canons and is the subject of some controversy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} period, from 1620 to {{the late}} 18th century, has often been called colloquially the [...] "Dark Age". The population of the Czech lands declined by a third through the expulsion of Czech Protestants as well as due to the war, disease and famine. The Habsburgs prohibited all <b>Christian</b> <b>confessions</b> other than Catholicism. The flowering of Baroque culture shows the ambiguity of this historical period.Ottoman Turks and Tatars invaded Moravia in 1663.

5000|$|The Christian Church in Italy has {{significant}} similarities with the Biblical Unitarian movement, although it maintains a cautious position on some doctrinal points. Wilbur wrote about this: [...] "The religious movement whose history we are endeavoring to trace...became fully developed in thought and polity in only four countries, one after another, namely Poland, Transylvania, England and America. But {{in each of}} these it showed, along with certain individual characteristics, a general spirit, a common point of view, and a doctrinal pattern that tempt one to regard them as all outgrowths of a single movement which passed from one to another; for nothing could be more natural than to presume that these common features implied a common ancestry. Yet such is not the fact, for {{in each of these}} four lands the movement, instead of having originated elsewhere, and been translated only after attaining mature growth, appears to have sprung independently and directly from its own native roots, and to have been influenced by other and similar movements only after it had already developed an independent life and character of its own.". From the analysis of documents that you can find on the official site of the CCI, {{it is clear that the}} doctrinal position of this <b>Christian</b> <b>confession</b> of faith is therefore akin to the so-called Biblical Unitarian movement [...] and on the other hand, far from that of Unitarian Universalist Association who, although they have the same origin in 1500 AD, through the centuries, have suffered the influence of many non-biblical ideas (cf. Universalism).|$|E
50|$|Justinian's {{victory in}} 535 opened {{the period of}} the Exarchate of Africa, which saw the {{persecution}} of the Jews with the Arians, the Donatists and the Gentiles. Stigmatized again, they are excluded from any public office, their synagogues are transformed into churches, their worship is proscribed and their meetings forbidden. The administration strictly applies the Codex Theodosianus against them, which allows the holding of forced conversions. If the emperor Maurice attempts to repeal these measures, his successors return there and an imperial edict imposes baptism on them. Some Jews have fled the Byzantine-controlled cities to settle in the mountains or on the confines of the desert and fight there {{with the support of the}} Berber tribes, many of whom would have been won by their proselytism. According to other historians, the Judaization of the Berbers would have taken place four centuries earlier, with the arrival of Jews fleeing the repression of the Cyrenaic revolt; The transition would have been made progressively through a Judeo-Pagan syncretism with the cult of Tanit, still anchored after the fall of Carthage. Whatever the hypothesis, the historian of the fourteenth century Ibn Khaldun confirms their existence on the eve of the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb on the basis of eleventh-century Arab chronicles. However, this version is fairly questioned: Haim Zeev Hirschberg recalls that the historian wrote his work several centuries after the facts, Mohamed Talbi that the French translation is not totally exact since it does not render the idea of the contingency expressed by the author, and Gabriel Camps that the Jarawa and Nefzaouas quoted were of <b>Christian</b> <b>confession</b> before the arrival of Islam.|$|E
40|$|Arianism’ {{has often}} been {{regarded}} as the archetypal Christian deviation, something aimed {{at the very heart}} of the <b>Christian</b> <b>confession</b> (Williams 2005 : 1). ” With these words archbishop Rowan Williams (1950 -) begins his magnum opus: Arius – heresy and tradition. The first edition of this book was published in 1987, and has since then been published in a second edition (2001), and a third impression (2005). While the book deals with the Arian heresy, what made it stand out was how it portrayed Arius as someone who perhaps had been given an unjustly bad rap. As he began saying, this event strikes at the heart of the <b>Christian</b> <b>confession</b> – and thus any re-presentation of Arius is a touchy one. So why do it? Why not let the past be the past? The answer to this is also found in that first phrase: this has to do with the heart of the Christianity...|$|E
