DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A monitored thread guiding device in a knitting machine, in which at least one thread is guided under predetermined tension along a free thread transport zone, has unit(s) for supplying the thread along the zone and a unit for receiving and/or further guiding the tensioned thread. An optical sensor unit, for contact-free detection of thread in the transport zone, generates a control or regulation signal for the thread supply and/or receiving unit(s). The novel feature is that a device for causing sideways oscillation of the thread from its path is provided along the transport zone. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a corresponding monitored thread guiding process, in which controlled transverse oscillations are induced in the thread in the transport zone, optical detection of a consequent dynamic sensor signal is used to indicate an undamaged thread and lack of detection of such a signal is used to detect a broken thread, in which case operation of the knitting machine is halted. USE - For monitored guiding of thread in a knitting machine, especially a <b>circular</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machine.</b> ADVANTAGE - Guiding of the threads is effectively monitored (especially as regards thread tension) while avoiding additional wear on the knitting machine side components (including the thread itself), so {{that the need for}} expensive and time-consuming maintenance operations is eliminated.

A ventilation structure, which combines spacers and mesh openings, was designed to improve the convective heat transfer and reduce the touch areas between the skin and fabrics. A sports T-shirt with the above mentioned ventilation parts was fabricated by using a <b>circular</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machine.</b> The pattern and fabrication process were investigated and optimized. The effect of ventilation design was evaluated by the Kawabata Evaluation System, the perspiring fabric manikin-Walter and wearer trials. Results demonstrated that the ventilation design can significantly increase both air circulation next to skin and ventilation cooling effect under windy condition and/or active body movement. The T-shirt with ventilation design provides significant advantages in wearers' thermal comfort, as manifested in reduced heat accumulation, lower skin temperature and humidity, better subjective sensation as well as reduced energy consumption during exercises. Thin Non-elastic Smooth String (TNSS) method was developed to measure the tensile force of sportswear. The tensile force and pressure of sportswear were investigated during main badminton actions. According to the tensile and pressure test, slashes design was developed for ease of body motion during badminton exercise. The slashes were fabricated by laser cutting to reduce the local tension and the resultant pressure when the cuts are opened and closed during body movement. The effect of slashes was examined and showed a significant influence on reducing tensile force. A new badminton sportswear was designed and developed based on the research, which combines ventilation structures and slashes {{in different parts of the}} garment. The design specifications and production process are introduced in details. The effects of the new sportswear on reducing the motion resistance and improving the ventilation were measured and evaluated. Comfort satisfaction, thermal and moisture sensation, clingy sensation, pressure sensation as well as tensile force sensation were assessed in three phases of badminton exercise by players. Compared to commercial badminton sportswear, the new sportswear achieved higher degree of wearer satisfaction, cooler/dryer sensation and lower sports constriction.

The {{population of the}} earth, {{as well as the}} average income, are both on the increase. Therefore the already high consumption of textiles in the world is expected to be even greater in the future. At present, 70 million tonnes of textile fibres are being produced yearly. This figure could rise to as much as 240 million within the next 35 years. In Sweden alone, the people were consuming around 12. 5 kilos of textiles per person in 2010. About 8 of these kilos were discarded as garbage. The textile industry is facing big challenges, both in finding new resources for production of fibres as well as dealing with the issue of large amounts of textile waste from consumers and companies. Re:newcell is a Swedish company financing research at Royal Institute of Technology, KTH, in Stockholm. Their researchers are investigating the possibility to recycle cotton and other cellulosic textile materials in order to produce dissolved pulp. Thereafter cellulosic man-made fibres are being produced from the pulp. The properties of lyocell fibres produced from the dissolved pulp from Re:newcell is being investigated in this Bachelor thesis. The dissolved pulp has been produced from jeans bought in second-hand shops. These fibres are being compared to the conventionally produced lyocell fibres, Tencel®. A ring spun yarn of each fibre type has been produced at the Swedish School of Textiles. The linear density of the yarns have been determined in order to achieve the same thickness of the yarn as a commercially spun yarn also made from Tencel® fibres. A test of tensile strength and elongation has been carried out on each of the three yarns. Thereafter the yarns have been used to manufacture a knitted fabric on a <b>circular</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machine.</b> Each of the knitted fabrics have gone through a series of tests regarding weight of fabric per square meter, dimensional change after washing, wicking and absorbency properties, dye exhaustion, colour staining to other materials during laundering and colour change after laundering, abrasion resistance and tendency to create fuzzing and pills. The purpose of the study is to make conclusions about whether this fibre has the potential to complement other cellulosic man-made fibres. The conclusion is that Re:newcell fibres can be used to spin a yarn with the linear density of 25 tex. This yarn can be utilized to produce a circular knitted fabric light enough to make T-shirts. After the testing it is concluded that the shrinking percentage after consumer’s washing is acceptable. In addition, the material could be worn close to the body because of the good absorbency and wicking properties. The exhaustion of dyestuff of antrakinon type from the dyeing liquor is equally very good. Although some of the dyestuff is being washed in laundering, the Re:newcell tricot is not staining other materials noticeably. The Re:newcell material can also withstand high abrasion against a woven wool material. The tendency to form fuzzing and pills is great but the pills are being torn of eventually. It may be concluded that the fibres, made by the dissolved pulp of Re:newcell in the lyocell process, can be used to manufacture a yarn with better strength than two investigated yarns of Tencel®. The tests carried out on the fabrics produced in the project show that the Re:newcell fibre has excellent properties in order to function as a material in a garment, for example a T-shirt. Therefore the dissolved pulp of Re:newcell has the possibility to be a new raw material in the production of man-made cellulosic fibres. This enables the textile industry to deal with their excess waste, and to meet the increasing demand for fibres in the world...|$|E

40|$|The {{clothing}} must have, {{in addition}} to the protective function of the body, aesthetic and hygienic functions. The comfort that the clothing is providing is influenced by processes of transfer of heat and moisture. These processes are considered as processes more complex, and which take account of: production and transfers heat and the humidity of the human body and transfer them in the framework of the system your body- clothing- environment, and second, the ventilation to and from the environment by clothing. To improve the understanding on this complex topic the paper presents one of the methods to analyze the comfort parameter on the knitting articles realized from different raw material on the small diameter <b>circular</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machines.</b> In the analysis processes of transfer of moisture by textile materials it is necessary to make a distinction between moisture transport in the form of vapor (molecule) and the in the liquid form (drop). The transfer of moisture by textile materials increases with the increase in permeability of the air, due to the structure of the fabric. In the purpose to analyze the type of the yarn influence on the transfer of humidity in the status of vapor through the knitted fabric, there were tested different samples knitted from 8 types of yarn...|$|R

5000|$|In Industrial Knitting applications, {{the terms}} [...] "Flat" [...] and [...] "Circular" [...] have very {{different}} meanings to those given above. A [...] "Flat" [...] or Vee Bed <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> consists of 2 flat needle beds arranged in an upside-down [...] "V" [...] formation. These needle beds can be up to 2.5 metres wide. A carriage, {{also known as a}} Cambox or Head, moves backwards and forwards across these needle beds, working the needles to selectively, knit, tuck or transfer stitches. A flat <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> is very flexible, allowing complex stitch designs, shaped knitting and precise width adjustment. It is, however relatively slow when compared to a <b>circular</b> <b>machine.</b> <b>Knitting</b> speed up to [...]5 m/s or low is considered the low speed in flat knitting which is generally in hand flat machines. The two largest manufacturers of industrial flat <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> are Stoll of Germany, and Shima Seiki of Japan. The industrial hand flat <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> is considered to be launched by the Isaac Lamb patents.|$|R

Two PDO monofilaments with linear densities of 100 ± 2 and 150 ± 2 tex respectively were used for producing a set of weft-knitted tubular stents using a small-diameter, <b>circular</b> weft <b>knitting</b> <b>machine.</b> The heat-setting treatment was used for the stents to restore a tubular shape. The physical, mechanical and thermal properties of the stents were examined before and after the heat-setting treatment. The results of mechanical testing illustrated that the prototype stents in this work could achieve higher radial forces than Wall stents and Z stents on the market. The heat setting with temperature of 80 ℃ and time of 5 min were found to be more appropriate for the stents. In conclusion, the stents were successfully developed and have potential application for the treatment of intestinal stenosis or obstruction. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
