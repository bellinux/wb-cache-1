40|$|Summary. Properties <b>of</b> the <b>latex</b> <b>coagulum</b> formed {{during the}} {{manufacture}} of styrene-butadiene latices were investigated. Processing conditions coagulum for further use {{in the composition of}} the polymer base composites and rubber compounds were grown. Plasticizers latex coagulum system, improving its handling on the process equipment were developed. In the process of changing the structure of the plasticization of the polymer matrix: solid areas appear in images taken with a scanning probe microscope. Ability to manufacture polymer composites based on treated latex coagulum was shown. When creating the polymeric compositions of styrene-butadiene rubber SCS- 30 - 15 ARKM plasticized <b>coagulum</b> optimum ratio <b>of</b> 70 : 30 has been selected. Influence the type and dosage of plasticizer viscosity compositions latex coagulum with rubber SKS- 30 - 15 ARKM been established. Application consisting of plasticized polymer base coagulum provides physic-mechanical properties of rubber at the control rules of molded rubber products. It is noted that the best combination of properties of rubber and rubber blends possess samples based polymer compositions <b>coagulum</b> plasticized combination <b>of</b> petroleum oils. It has been established that the use <b>of</b> <b>latex</b> <b>coagulum</b> in the polymer base composition causes sufficiently high values of Mooney viscosity and short curing starts. The influence of active chemical additives (derivatives of saturated fatty acids, 2, 2 -azo-bis-isobutyronitrile) to change the properties <b>of</b> the <b>latex</b> <b>coagulum</b> during machining on a mill was studied.

40|$|The {{effects of}} plasticizer, {{physical}} aging, and film-forming temperature on the mechanical and transport properties of films formed from aqueous dispersions <b>of</b> ethylcellulose <b>latex</b> were investigated. The {{water vapor permeability}} <b>of</b> <b>latex</b> films was found to decrease with diethyl phthalate to a minimum value and then to increase with diethyl phthalate at higher concentrations. Because of the decrease in free volume and the further coalescence <b>of</b> particles <b>of</b> <b>latex</b> polymer films in the physical aging range, the creep compliance <b>of</b> <b>latex</b> films decreased with physical aging time. Within 60 to 100 °C, the film-forming temperature {{was found to have}} no effect on the mechanical and transport properties of Aquacoat films. However, since many pinholes formed in the latex films when the film-forming temperature was above 100 °C, the water vapor permeability <b>of</b> <b>latex</b> films was higher than that <b>of</b> <b>latex</b> films formed between 60 and 100 °C.

Finally, two latexes which were better in LMCs general properties (i. e. Acrylic and Co-polymer Acrylic) were incorporated at 5 and 15 % <b>of</b> <b>latex</b> contents to concrete. The result have shown that the increase in the amount <b>of</b> <b>latex</b> content decreased the compressive strength, but the other properties including flexural strength and split tensile strength were improved.
