5|$|One of {{the largest}} {{employers}} is the centrally located supermarket, which as of January 2006 was considering further expansion. It {{is one of the}} major attractions to the town's shopping centre, however there are fears that its expansion could lead it to become too dominant, at the cost of smaller shops in the town. Apart from tourism and retail, many jobs are also provided in the manufacturing industry, mainly located in industrial estates on the outskirts of the town, which produce goods such as kitchen furniture and factory machinery. A high number of construction jobs have been created by redevelopment of the seafront, which is expected to continue with the proposed regeneration of the town centre. The elderly population of the town has led to many Health and Social Care jobs at local <b>care</b> <b>homes</b> and at the town's Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital.

40|$|Pneumonia is a {{prevalent}} {{cause of}} death in <b>care</b> <b>home</b> residents. Dysphagia is a significant risk factor of aspiration pneumonia. The purpose of the current study was to screen for risk of aspiration in <b>care</b> <b>home</b> residents in the Netherlands and assess potential risk factors of aspiration. Five experienced speech-language therapists assessed 203 <b>care</b> <b>home</b> residents (115 primarily physically disabled, 88 primarily cognitively impaired) 60 and older in the first week after admission to a <b>care</b> <b>home.</b> In 43 (21. 2 %) residents, speech-language therapists assessed risk of aspiration and found no significant difference between physically disabled (26. 1 %) and cognitively impaired (14. 8 %) residents. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, the final prediction model for risk of aspiration showed Parkinson's disease as a significant factor (odds ratio = 5. 11; 95 % confidence interval [1. 49, 17. 52]). The authors therefore conclude that risk of aspiration is a relevant care problem among Dutch <b>care</b> <b>home</b> residents and requires further assessment...|$|R

40|$|Investigated the {{cost-effectiveness}} of {{the first}} psychiatric long-stay <b>care</b> <b>home</b> in Hong Kong, which opened in 1990. This was a prospective cohort study {{of the first}} 43 patients (aged 21 - 79 yrs) discharged to the long-stay <b>care</b> <b>home</b> from Castle Peak Hospital, who were followed-up for 2 years. Patients had significantly improved social and community skills while remaining behaviourally and symptomatically stable. The long-stay <b>care</b> <b>home</b> provided a less restrictive environment than Castle Peak Hospital, and patients' satisfaction was high. The recurring costs for the long-stay <b>care</b> <b>home</b> were lower than for the hospital. The only statistically significant adverse finding was deterioration in personal health care skills 2 years after leaving the medical setting. This study provides the first scientific evidence in Hong Kong {{to show that the}} long-stay <b>care</b> <b>home</b> is a cost-effective means of successfully rehabilitating a group of long-stay mental hospital inpatients who do not qualify for halfway houses but require only minimal nursing care (less than 2. 5 hours per week).
