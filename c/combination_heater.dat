Conventional thermal {{processing}} of foods containing particulates significantly rely on convective and conductive heat transfer {{and tend to}} be overly conservative in ensuring microbial safety, thus compromising quality. Temperature lags inside particles of solid-liquid mixture foods {{could lead to the}} danger of under-processing and therefore risking the food’s safety. Advanced food processing technologies such as microwave heating and ohmic heating have been developed in the last few decades as alternatives to conventional processing methods. These advanced technologies could contribute to shorten processing times, energy savings, and highly balanced safe food; however, they alone still cannot guarantee food safety without damaging the food’s quality. Therefore, a new concept to combine microwave and ohmic heating has been extensively evaluated. This combination technology would optimize each of the individual technology’s strengths and reduce each of their individual weaknesses. In this study, a dual cylindrical microwave and ohmic combination continuous flow heater was designed and fabricated to heat treat solid-liquid mixture foods without under- processing the solid particulates. The electric field distribution under microwave and ohmic heating was numerically analyzed; the use of cylindrical microwave cavity was suitable to maximize the electric strength in the <b>combination</b> <b>heater.</b> Thermal profiles of solid-liquid mixtures consisted of chicken and potato particles, and sodium chloride solution (0. 5, 1. 25, and 2. 0 % concentration) at different solid fraction 10 and 15 % were collected and compared. These profiles were recorded for both individual heating (either microwave or ohmic heating) and combination heating (microwave and ohmic together) until the exit temperature of either solid particles for solution reached 80 °C. In individual ohmic heating, particle size and slat concentration affected temperature differences between the particulates and the solution. In individual microwave heating, the solution temperature lagged behind the particle temperature with salt concentrations up to 1. 25 %, regardless of particle size and solid fraction; however, a different tendency was observed in the food mixtures including 2 % salt concentration. The maximum temperature differences between solid and liquid phases obtained by individual microwave and ohmic heating were 7. 1 ± 1. 7 and 11. 9 ± 2. 9 °C, respectively. In the combination heating, only small temperature gaps between solid particles and liquid (maximum difference < 3. 08 °C) at low salt concentrations (up to 1. 25 %) were observed. A 3 D block diagram constructed using the controlled ranges of salt concentration, particle size, and solid fraction estimated by empirical polynomial equations was used to describe temperature similarities between solid and liquid phases when combination heating was applied. This unique continuous flow <b>combination</b> <b>heater</b> has the potential to thermally process multiphase foods with improvements in heat distribution, energy efficiency, and food quality. Computational modeling for individual microwave and ohmic heating, and the combination heating in a continuous flow system were established. The modeling of the continuous flow system was important for future designing of a production-scale unit. Accurate prediction of temperature distribution in solid-liquid mixture foods was demonstrated using the computational modeling. Numerical modeling of the combination heating technique was a challenge due to simultaneous changes in heat and particulate flow pattern in the continuous flow system. This study employed the COMSOL software which enabled a numerical model to simulate the complicated simultaneous changes during the combination heating technique. The temperature profile of the combination heating was simulated during a lethality test of Escherichia coli K 12 inoculated carrot balls. The carrot ball’s exit temperature reached 90 °C in 56 seconds, as predicted by computational model. The reliable prediction of particulate temperature in this complicated system {{can be attributed to the}} integration of the two-dimensional moving mesh method and the arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) equation in the COMSOL software. Results indicated that the combination heating technique has potential to inactivate E. coli K 12 in carrot balls with improved lethal activities. The simulated flow patterns and thermal profiles of multiphase foods showed the heating mechanism and the movement of particulates during combination heating. The experimental data were in good agreement with the simulated heating profile of particulates with a maximum prediction error of 5 %...|$|E

The sensor is specifically designed to achieve high sensitivity, fast response time and high robustness. The proof of concept is composed of four metallic resistors interconnected to form a Wheatstone bridge. Two of them act simultaneously as the heating and sensing elements and the two others are used as a temperature reference. The heating element consists of a metallic wire of platinum Pt (3 μm width, 1 mm length) maintained on each lateral side by periodic silicon oxide SiO 2 micro-bridges.

50|$|Pressure is {{controlled}} in a {{pressurized water reactor}} {{to ensure that the}} core itself does not reach its boiling point in which the water will turn into steam and rapidly decrease the heat being transferred from the fuel to the moderator. By a <b>combination</b> of <b>heaters</b> and spray valves, pressure {{is controlled}} in the pressurizer vessel which is connected to the reactor plant. Because the pressurizer vessel and the reactor plant are connected, the pressure of the steam space pressurizes the entire reactor plant to ensure the pressure is above that which would allow boiling in the reactor core. The pressurizer vessel itself may be maintained much hotter {{than the rest of the}} reactor plant to ensure pressure control, because in the liquid throughout the reactor plant, pressure applied at any point has an effect on the entire system, whereas the heat transfer is limited by ambient and other losses.|$|R

40|$|A {{gas-fired}} vented zone heater {{has recently}} been developed by the Altar Corporation for Colorado State University (CSU) under a Gas Research Institute (GRI) contract. The unit war developed for auxiliary heating applications in passive solar buildings. An early prototype was tested at Altas and operated as expected. The final model was shipped to CSU in December 1983 for testing in the REPEAT Facility at CSU. A heat pipe extends through the wall {{to the outside of}} the building. It has a modest water charge which can freeze repeatedly with no damage, since the heat pips is only partially filled. Firing efficiency at 4, 000 Btu/b (1. 17 kW thermal) is approximately 80 %. The unit features a 3 foot by 3 foot radiator mounted inside the room to be heated, and is thermostatically controlled. Ignition is accomplished with an electronic sparker (pilot). The radiator typically operates at 150 - 180 ?F (65 - 82 ?C), and has been operated at between 2, 000 and 5, 000 Btu/h (0. 6 - 1. 47 kW).

5000|$|Solvent inks: The main {{ingredient}} of these inks are {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), organic chemical compounds that have high vapor pressures. Color is achieved with pigments rather than dyes for excellent fade-resistance. The chief advantage of solvent inks {{is that they are}} comparatively inexpensive and enable printing on flexible, uncoated vinyl substrates, which are used to produce vehicle graphics, billboards, banners and adhesive decals. Disadvantages include the vapour produced by the solvent and the need to dispose of used solvent. Unlike most aqueous inks, prints made using solvent-based inks are generally waterproof and ultraviolet-resistant (for outdoor use) without special over-coatings. The high print speed of many solvent printers demands special drying equipment, usually a <b>combination</b> of <b>heaters</b> and blowers. The substrate is usually heated immediately before and after the print heads apply ink. Solvent inks are divided into two sub-categories: hard solvent ink offers the greatest durability without specialized over-coatings but requires specialized ventilation of the printing area to avoid exposure to hazardous fumes, while Mild or [...] "Eco" [...] solvent inks, while still not as safe as aqueous inks, are intended for use in enclosed spaces without specialized ventilation of the printing area. Mild solvent inks have rapidly gained popularity in recent years as their color quality and durability have increased while ink cost has dropped significantly.|$|R
40|$|The {{dehydrogenation}} behaviour of a cylindrical Mg {{metal hydride}} tank is simulated and {{examined in the}} case where the tank is thermally coupled with an operating Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) at 7000 C. A three-dimensional validated mathematical model is utilized to simulate the hydrogen desorption from a cylindrical Mg hydride tank. Four scenarios are simulated: a base case where the heat source for the desorption process is an external heater surrounding the tank. The second case examines {{the effect of the}} radiation heat transfer from the SOFC to the metal hydride as a possible heat source for the desorption procedure. The third scenario uses the exhaust air from the SOFC cathode as the heating source which is driven to the hydride and the fourth scenario is a combination of both the exhaust air from the SOFC cathode and the external heater as the heat source for the desorption. According to the results, the exhaust air from the SOFC and the <b>combination</b> of external <b>heater</b> and the exhaust heat have a uniform temperature distribution within the tank and enhance the desorption capacity.

40|$|Better growing {{conditions}} are achieved in greenhouses by maintaining a higher internal ambient {{as compared with}} external ambient temperature. A computer-based control and monitoring system which provides visualization, control and coordination of temperature and humidity in a greenhouse was recently developed. To validate the system performance, a number of experiments were carried out during the autumn of 2003. In this paper, one of the experimental results conducted from 10 to 12 a. m. on December 7, 2003, {{in the city of}} Karaj, is presented and discussed. The system was tested for two modes of operation: the uncontrolled mode of operation and the controlled mode. Four sensors, three for temperature measurements and one for relative humidity measurements, were installed inside and outside. During the first hour and a half the system was tested as a data-acquisition system, ie, only data from the sensors were recorded and monitored on the screen with no operation of fans, sprayer and other installed environmental systems in the greenhouse. For the last 20 min of the experiment, inside air temperature was controlled by the system. The result on temperature measurements shows that external ambient temperature, Tout, is always less than the inside temperature. This is attributed to the solar radiation entering the greenhouse through transparent plastic and being trapped there. We also observed fluctuations on temperature profile inside the greenhouse. This is caused by natural conditions such as surface evaporation within the greenhouse, solar radiation, external ambient temperature and rapid weather changes {{during the time of the}} experiment. It was also found that the rate of change of temperature increase in the upper part, Tup, ie near plastic cover, is higher than that of the plants height, Tmid. This rise in vertical temperature gradient is partly due to the different amount of solar incident radiation being received at the locations of sensors. This trend proves the effectiveness of our polytube system, a re- circulating fan with an attached perforated polyethylene tube, in guiding the air toward the plant root zone. For the last 20 min of the experiment, the controller was put into action. The overall per- formance of the system in maintaining the temperature within a given range, around the set point, is found to be satisfactory. The time constant of the fan and <b>heater</b> <b>combination</b> was short, about 10 min, in reaching the desired set point temperature...|$|R
40|$|CONSOL Energy Inc., Research & Development (CONSOL), {{with support}} from the U. S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE) is {{evaluating}} the effects of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) on mercury (Hg) capture in coal-fired plants equipped with an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) - wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) combination or a spray dyer absorber [...] fabric filter (SDA-FF) combination. In this program CONSOL is determining mercury speciation and removal at 10 coal-fired facilities. The objectives are (1) to evaluate the effect of SCR on mercury capture in the ESP-FGD and SDA-FF combinations at coal-fired power plants, (2) evaluate the effect of catalyst degradation on mercury capture; (3) evaluate the effect of low load operation on mercury capture in an SCR-FGD system, and (4) collect data that could provide the basis for fundamental scientific insights into the nature of mercury chemistry in flue gas, the catalytic effect of SCR systems on Hg speciation and the efficacy of different FGD technologies for Hg capture. This document, the second in a series of topical reports, describes the results and analysis of mercury sampling performed on a 330 MW unit burning a bituminous coal containing 1. 0 % sulfur. The unit is equipped with a SCR system for NOx control and a spray dryer absorber for SO{sub 2 } control followed by a baghouse unit for particulate emissions control. Four sampling tests were performed in March 2003. Flue gas mercury speciation and concentrations were determined at the SCR inlet, air heater outlet (ESP inlet), and at the stack (FGD outlet) using the Ontario Hydro method. Process stream samples for a mercury balance were collected to coincide with the flue gas measurements. Due to mechanical problems with the boiler feed water pumps, the actual gross output was between 195 and 221 MW during the tests. The results showed that the SCR/air <b>heater</b> <b>combination</b> oxidized nearly 95 % of the elemental mercury. Mercury removal, on a coal-to-stack basis, was 87 %. The mercury material balance closures for the four tests conducted at the plant ranged from 89 % to 114 %, with an average of 100 %. These results appear to show that the SCR had a positive effect on mercury removal. In earlier programs, CONSOL sampled mercury at six plants with wet FGDs for SO{sub 2 } control without SCR catalysts. At those plants, an average of 61 {+-} 15 % of the mercury was in the oxidized form at the air heater outlet. The principal purpose of this work is to develop {{a better understanding of the}} potential Hg removal ''co-benefits'' achieved by NOx, and SO{sub 2 } control technologies. It is expected that this data will provide the basis for fundamental scientific insights into the nature of Hg chemistry in flue gas, the catalytic effect of SCR systems on Hg speciation and the efficacy of different FGD technologies for Hg capture. Ultimately, this insight could help to design and operate SCR and FGD systems to maximize Hg removal...|$|R
40|$|CONSOL Energy Inc., Research & Development (CONSOL), {{with support}} from the U. S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), {{evaluated}} the effects of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) on mercury (Hg) capture in coal-fired plants equipped with an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) -wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) combination or a spray dyer absorber-fabric filter (SDA-FF) combination. In this program CONSOL determined mercury speciation and removal at 10 bituminous coal-fired facilities; at four of these facilities, additional tests were performed on units without SCR, or with the existing SCR bypassed. This project final report summarizes the results and discusses the findings of the body of work as a whole. Eleven Topical Reports were issued (prior to this report) that describe in great detail the sampling results at each of the ten power plants individually. The results showed that the SCR-FGD combination removed a substantial fraction of mercury from flue gas. The coal-to-stack mercury removals ranged from 65 % to 97 % for the units with SCR and from 53 % to 87 % for the units without SCR. There was no indication that any type of FGD system was more effective at mercury removal than others. The coal-to-stack mercury removal and the removal in the wet scrubber were both negatively correlated with the elemental mercury content of the flue gas and positively correlated with the scrubber liquid chloride concentration. The coal chlorine content was not a statistically significant factor in either case. Mercury removal in the ESP was positively correlated with the fly ash carbon content and negatively correlated with the flue gas temperature. At most of the units, a substantial fraction (> 35 %) of the flue gas mercury was in the elemental form at the boiler economizer outlet. After passing through the SCR-air <b>heater</b> <b>combination</b> very little of the total mercury (< 10 %) remained in the elemental form in the flue gas; this was true for all SCR catalyst types and sources. Although chlorine has been suggested as a factor affecting the mercury speciation in flue gas, coal chlorine was not a statistically significant factor affecting mercury speciation at the economizer exit or at the air heater exit. The only statistically significant factors were the coal ash CaO content and the fly ash carbon content; the fraction of mercury in the elemental form at the economizer exit was positively correlated with both factors. In a direct comparison at four SCR-equipped units vs. similar units at the same sites without SCR (or with the SCR bypassed), the elemental mercury fractions (measured at the ESP outlet) were lower, and the coal-to-stack mercury removals were higher, when the SCR was present and operating. The average coal-to-stack mercury removal at the four units without an operating SCR was 72 %, whereas the average removal at the same sites with operating SCRs was 88 %. The unit mercury mass balance (a gauge of the overall quality of the tests) at all of the units ranged from 81 % to 113 %, which were within our QA/QC criterion of 80 - 120 %...|$|R
