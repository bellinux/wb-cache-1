5000|$|First {{released}} on June 15, 2007, in German-speaking Europe, [...] "Maybe" [...] debuted at number 36 on the German Singles Chart based on <b>composite</b> <b>digital</b> single and CD maxi single sales, {{making it the}} band's lowest-debuting entry to date. As the single {{fell out of the}} top 50 in it second week and failed to climb again during its seven-week chart run, it would become the band's first single to miss the top 20 on that particular chart, thus also making it the group's lowest-charting single since their formation in fall 2000. On the component charts, the track peaked at number 70 on the German Airplay Chart, according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
50|$|The D-2 format {{system from}} Sony and Ampex soon {{followed}} two years later, using composite video {{in order to}} lower the bandwidth needed. This reduced D-2's price tag to half that of D-1. Since D-2 was <b>composite</b> <b>digital</b> as opposed to component, it could easily be dropped into the space and infrastructure of composite analog machines presently used at the time (2-inch Quadruplex, 1-inch Type C and 3/4-inch U-Matic). Since less information was recorded on D-2 than on D-1, tape speed could be reduced and hold a maximum of 208 minutes compared to D-1's 94 minutes. However, D-2 was still a compromise, being composite video.|$|E
50|$|Ampex {{created the}} first D-2 video machine, the ACR-225 {{commercial}} spot player working with Sony, who had done some early research into <b>composite</b> <b>digital</b> video, as a cost-effective solution for TV broadcasters with large investments in composite analog infrastructure such as video routers and switchers, since it could be inserted into existing analog broadcast facilities without extensive redesign or modifications. This was because D-2 machines accepted standard analog video and audio inputs and outputs. D-2 machines are capable of interfacing through either serial digital video or analog video connections. Four PCM audio channels are available for editing (an improvement over the then-popular Type C analog machines with two audio channels) {{as well as an}} analog cue channel and timecode, also with digital or analog connections.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMeso-scale (unit cell of an {{impregnated}} textile reinforcement) {{finite element}} (FE) modelling of textile composites {{is a powerful}} tool for homogenisation of mechanical properties, study of stress-strain fields inside the unit cell, determination of damage initiation conditions and sites and simulation of damage development and associated deterioration of the homogenised mechanical properties of the composite. Validation of meso-FE modelling requires registration of details of the deformed state on the scale of individual yarns inside the textile, registered using full-field strain measurements {{on the surface of the}} sample. The paper presents examples of such a validation of meso-FE models of woven (carbon/epoxy and glass/polypropylene) and braided (carbon/epoxy) <b>composites.</b> <b>Digital</b> image correlation and digital phase shifting grating shearography are used for full-field strain registration.

Following its physical release on March 16, 2007 in German-speaking Europe, the single debuted at number 4 on the German Singles Chart based on <b>composite</b> <b>digital</b> singles and CD singles sales, becoming the No Angels' highest-charting single since 2003's [...] "Feelgood Lies."

50|$|D-3 is an {{uncompressed}} <b>composite</b> <b>digital</b> video videocassette format invented at NHK, {{and introduced}} commercially by Panasonic in 1991 {{to compete with}} Ampex's D-2. It uses half-inch metal particle tape at 83.88 mm/s (compare to D-2's 19 mm and 131.7 mm/s). Like D-2, the composite video signal is sampled at four times the color subcarrier frequency, with eight bits per sample. Four channels of 48 kHz 16-20 bit PCM audio, and other ancillary data, are inserted during the vertical blanking interval. The aggregate net (error corrected) bitrate of the format is 143 Mbit/s, and because the codec is lossless, {{it has been used}} in data applications. Camcorders were available which used this format, and are to date the only digital tape camcorders to use a lossless encoding scheme. The D-5 format, introduced in 1993 by Panasonic and marketed as D-5 HD, uses the D-3 transport and tape running at roughly double D-3 speed. The D-3 transport in turn is derived from the MII transport. D-3/D-5 tapes come in small (161 mm × 96 mm × 25 mm), medium (212 mm × 124 mm × 25 mm), and large (296 mm × 167 mm × 25 mm) cassettes, with format-specific recognition holes. Maximum D-3 runtimes (in the Fujifilm lineup) are 50, 126, and 248 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Central Portugal is {{well known}} for the {{existence}} of Sn-W and Au-Ag mineral occurrences primarily associated with hydrothermal processes. Despite the economic and strategic importance of such occurrences, the detailed geology of this particular region is poorly known and there is an obvious absence of geological mapping at an adequate scale. Remote sensing techniques were used in order to increase current geological knowledge of the Góis–Castanheira de Pêra area (600 km 2) and to guide future exploration stages by targeting and prioritising potential locations. Digital image processing algorithms, such as Red, Green, Blue (RGB) colour <b>composites,</b> <b>digital</b> spatial filters, band ratios and Principal Components Analysis, were applied to Landsat 8 imagery and elevation data. Lineaments were extracted relying on geological photointerpretation criteria, allowing the identification of new geological–structural elements. Fieldwork was carried out in order to validate the remote sensing interpretations. Integration of remote sensing data with other information sources led to the definition of locations possibly suitable for hosting Sn-W and Au-Ag mineral occurrences. These areas were ranked according to their mineral potential. Targeting the most promising locations resulted in a reduction to less than 10 % of the original study area (50. 5 km 2) ...|$|R

The Inverter could be modeled as a feed back control system with the fundamental component of the voltage as the desired output while the voltage harmonics take the role of noise creeping into the output.
