We propose {{to use the}} downwind limited scheme (also <b>called</b> Ultra-Bee <b>limiter</b> {{in the context of}} pure advection), in order to avoid any artificial numerical spreading of interfaces or mixing zones.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} {{variation}} of simulated annealing algorithm for optimizing two-dimensional constellations with up to 32 signals. We focus on optimizing the pragmatic average mutual information, which is shown to be the relevant measure for pragmatic schemes usually adopted in the receiver. The method allows the joint optimization of constellation and binary labeling. We investigate {{the performance of the}} optimized constellation over both AWGN channel and nonlinear satellite channel. The optimized constellations perform considerably better than the conventional Amplitude Phase Shift Keying (APSK) modulations over the AWGN, used in the current digital video broadcasting standard (DVB-S 2). As for the nonlinear channel, we consider the so <b>called</b> Soft <b>Limiter</b> model for the high power amplifier. We provide simulation results in realistic scenarios using the DVB-S 2 standard LDPC to show the gains obtained by the proposed constellations...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a method, constructed such that numerical solutions {{of the wave}} equation are well behaved also when the solutions contain discontinuities. The wave equation serves as a model problem for the Euler equations when the solution contains a contact discontinuity. Numerical computations of the wave equation in 1 D, the Euler equations in 1 D and the wave equation with variable coefficients in 2 D are presented. 1 Introduction It {{is well known that}} contact discontinuities are smeared when a first order method is used to calculate the solution of the Euler equations, see e. g. [3]. With second order methods, oscillations appear. A common way to deal with contact discontinuities in numerical calculations in gas dynamics is to use a so <b>called</b> compressive <b>limiter</b> for the linear field, see e. g. [1],[4]. When a compressive limiter, like the super-bee limiter, is used to solve the wave equation the solution will not be smeared when the initial data is a step-function. On the other hand, if [...] ...|$|R
50|$|If the {{defrosting}} system melts all the ice {{before the}} timed defrosting period ends, then a small device (<b>called</b> a defrost <b>limiter)</b> {{acts like a}} thermostat and shuts off the heating element to prevent too large a temperature fluctuation, it also prevents hot blasts of air when the system starts again, should it finish defrosting early. On some early frost-free models, the defrost limiter also sends {{a signal to the}} defrost timer to start the compressor and fan as soon as it shuts off the heating element before the timed defrost cycle ends. When the defrost cycle is completed, the compressor and fan are allowed to cycle back on.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The up-gradation of an Electrical power {{generation}} network results in {{higher levels of}} short circuit fault current. Thereby, the existing protection equipment like circuit breakers, isolators and fuses become under capacity and not capable of withstanding higher short circuit currents. Thus the system is highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of short circuits. Replacing the whole protection switchgear is not feasible technically and economically. The solution {{in such a situation}} is an equipment <b>called</b> Fault Current <b>Limiter</b> (FCL). The concept of FCL is not new but the most suitable FCL is an on going research subject. This paper covers the prevailing aspects of FCL, the types of FCL, the research progress and at present the most viable FCL solution for industrial purpose at 6. 3 kV system in Pakistan...|$|R
40|$|Historically, the Gaussian {{assumption}} for {{noise and}} interferences has dominated signal processing. The justification for this assumption is usually {{given by the}} well known central limit theorem which allows an elegant, manageable, and meaningful mathematical description of noise. Nevertheless, some communication scenarios are characterized by impulsive properties on behalf of Gaussian noise, so they are non-Gaussian distributed. Channels which are corrupted with impulsive noise {{can be found in}} several domains like for example powerline communications, ethernet traffic, underwater signal processing, or as proven in this project also the multiuser interferences of ultra wideband (UWB) communication systems. After describing and discussing impulsive noise models in detail, a comparison of their distributions has been carried out showing the suitability of the different models for solving selected problems. For example, {{it is well known that}} the channel capacity with additive impulsive noise channels is always greater than the one of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels supposed that the signal to noise ratio (SNR) remains unchanged. In this project the capacity of channels corrupted by impulsive noise has been investigated. An example shows the negative effect of the widely used hard limiter (for impulsive noise clipping) and suggests the use of an alternative one <b>called</b> soft <b>limiter</b> allowing no loss of information. Furthermore, UWB systems have been investigated regarding multiuser interferences. It is proven that the multiuser interferences of impulse radio systems are impulsive. Their probability density function is determined analytically and confirmed by simulation results. Taking this result into account a new receiver structure has been developed allowing the suppression of impulsive noise without use of a limiter. The performance of this receiver is proven by simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this lecture note is to show how finite-difference schemes {{can be used in}} image analysis. We first {{introduce}} in Section 1 the main notation and consider the 2 -D heat equation. The remainder of this note is concerned with the discretization of certain PDEs used in image analysis: • Restoration by energy minimization (Section 2) : We detail the dis-cretization of the divergence term, which can also be found for the Perona and Malik equation. • Enhancement by Osher and Rudin’s shock filters (Section 3) : The main interest is to use a flux <b>limiter</b> <b>called</b> minmod. • Curve evolution with level sets and especially segmentation with geodesic active contours (Section 4). For the sake of simplicity. we examine separately each term of the model (mean curvature motion, constant speed motion, advection equation). We essentially write their discretization and give some experimental results. For more details of finite difference methods, see [2, 6, 12]; for hyperbolic equations, see [3, 5] Note: This lecture note is for the three hours lecture in the NIMS Work-shop and Minicourse “Mathematical Analysis, Numerics and Applications in Fluid and Gas Dynamics”.

40|$|The devices {{used for}} sensor {{protection}} against laser pulses are <b>called</b> optical <b>limiters.</b> The ideal optical limiter has the characteristics {{has a high}} linear transmission for low input (e. g. energy E or power P), a variable limiting input E or P, and a large dynamic range defined as {{the ratio of the}} E or P at which the device damages (irreversibly) to the limiting input. Such devices can also be used as power or energy regulators. However, since the primary application of the optical limiter is for sensor protection, and damage to detectors is almost always determined by fluence or irradiance, these are usually the quantities of interest for the output of the limiter. Getting ideal limiting response turns out to be possible using a wide variety of materials; however, {{it is very difficult to}} get the limiting threshold as low as is often required and at the same time have a large dynamic range. Because high transmission for low inputs is desired, the material/device must have low linear absorption. These criteria lead to the use of two-photon absorption (2 PA) and nonlinear refraction phenomena in practice. Any material (both inorganic or organic) which shows nonlinear absorption can be used for practical limiters. Unfortunately, except in the IR region, 2 PA coefficients of inorganic solids are too small for most of these applications which look to protect against nanosecond sources. Organic materials have the potential for larger nonlinearities and are being actively investigated. In addition, if small linear absorption can be tolerated, reverse saturable absorbers can be effective. Here the transmitted fluence is reduced so that the energy of a long pulse is limited as well as a short pulse as long as the pulse width is less than excited-state decay times. In this paper, we have anslysed the characteristics of the ideal optical limiter and reviewed the recent efforts by many researchers on the realization of best optical limiter using nonlinear organic materials...|$|R
40|$|The thesis topic {{concerns}} {{the limitation of}} fault current high temperature superconducting (HTS), reported in scientific literature by the acronym HTSFCL (High Temperature Superconducting Fault Current Limiter) or more commonly with SFCL. These devices, at least in their ideal concept, turn on limiting short-circuit current only when the event of failure occurs, and are transparent to the network during normal operating conditions. The thesis is therefore focused {{on the study of}} diff�erent types of SFCL and results in the production of a new and original concept of superconducting <b>limiter,</b> <b>called</b> "DC Resistive SFCL". It has designed and patented in the Department of Electrical Engineering University of Bologna. The author and ing. Antonio Morandi (tutor) are the inventors. The objective of the thesis is therefore to propose a type of SFCL which may have {{the potential to be a}} viable economic solution as well as technique. The innovative concept of DC Resistive SFCL device, in fact, provides a DC operating conditions for the used superconducting (SC). It allows the use of cryogen-free solutions for cooling system and the exploitation of cheap SC materials (MgB 2), both of reality are already commercially existing and indeed precluded by the types of SFCL which provides an AC operating conditions for the used SC material...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the events}} of Closer, Colonel Bismarck, deprogrammed by an {{explosion}} during {{the attack on the}} Bank of England, decides to help defeat the Styx, and joins Will and Drake at Parry's estate. Drake introduces Will and Chester to three retired commandos living at Parry's estate: [...] "Sparks" [...] Sweeney, who was surgically altered to have enhanced senses and faster reaction times, Danforth, a genius who worked in defense electronics, and Jiggs, who is very good at hiding. Will also meets Parry's gardener, Old Wilkie, and his granddaughter Stephanie. The people of the estate watch for Styx presence, and eliminate the Dark Light conditioning {{with the help of a}} device known as the Purger, invented by Danforth. The Purger causes a Darklit person to repeat part of their programming, and Elliott, who is able to speak Styx, finds that Chester has been programmed to call the Styx and report their location. Bartleby and Colly, the Hunters, are engaged in a hunt near the estate, when they encounter two of the Styx soldiers <b>called</b> <b>Limiters</b> spying on the manor. The Limiters wound Colly, and kill Bartleby. Will and the group decide to leave when Mrs. Burrows detects Limiters entering the estate. They escape, only to be cornered by Eddie the Styx, who reveals that the Limiters, rogues like him, are under his control, he was the one Chester was reporting to, and that he saved Emily Rawls, Chester's mother, from being used as a terrorist by the Styx. After much hesitation and discussion he decides he must tell them of the Phase. Meanwhile, in the Colony, the Second Officer begins to worry, as the Styx are neglecting the Colonists to focus on their Topsoil plans. Many people have been moved to an unruly and violent shantytown in the North Cavern to make room for the New Germanian army, and people are disappearing. Topsoil, various terrorist attacks are made by Darklit people who have had bombs surgically implanted within them, and these [...] "human bombs" [...] kill foreign politicians to stir up hatred of Britain. At a factory bought by the Old Styx, the Rebecca Twins have brought several hundred humans and Darklit them to render them brain-dead, perfect hosts for the Phase. They have also brought the Styx's females, who are undergoing part of the Styx's life cycle called the Phase. The Styx are revealed to be an insect species with a unique trait: at infrequent intervals (hundreds or thousands of years apart), the Styx women grow a pair of insect limbs and a mosquito-like ovipositor, used to insert egg sacs into human hosts. From each egg sac, thirty Styx larvae hatch and eat the host from the inside, also absorbing the host's genetic code, explaining why the Styx so closely mimic humans. Styx females who haven't gone through puberty, such as the Rebecca Twins, only experience back pain and minor bleeding where the insect limbs would grow if they were old enough to join in the Phase. Eddie also reveals that in the event the Warrior Class was killed, the Armagi would be released. The Armagi are capable of adapting to all environments, with three legs on land, fins and gills for water, or wings for air. The most horrifying aspect is that they can regenerate their entire body from just a single cell, making them nearly impossible to kill. Upon learning this, Drake and them decide they must take action. They set up headquarters in a military base known as the Complex, bomb shelter for the UK High Command dating back to the Great War. As a newscast reveals, strong anger has arisen worldwide over the human bomb attacks originating from Britain, and the United States and other countries cut off their connections to Britain, which closes its borders and puts itself under martial law. Underground, the Styx abandon the Colony and seal the exits after evacuating the people of the shantytown to use as hosts for the Phase. Finally, Eddie is brought back to base where [...] Elliott angrily attacks him.|$|R
40|$|Nucleus {{cochlear}} implant systems incorporate a fast-acting front-end {{automatic gain control}} (AGC), sometimes <b>called</b> a compression <b>limiter.</b> The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the effect of replacing the front-end compression limiter with a newly proposed envelope profile limiter. A secondary objective was to investigate the effect of AGC speed on {{cochlear implant}} speech intelligibility. The envelope profile limiter was located after the filter bank and reduced the gain when the largest of the filter bank envelopes exceeded the compression threshold. The compression threshold was set equal to the saturation level of the loudness growth function (i. e. the envelope level that mapped to the maximum comfortable current level), ensuring that no envelope clipping occurred. To preserve the spectral profile, the same gain was applied to all channels. Experiment 1 compared sentence recognition with the front-end limiter and with the envelope profile limiter, each with two release times (75 and 625 ms). Six implant recipients were tested in quiet and in four-talker babble noise, at a high presentation level of 89 dB SPL. Overall, release time had a larger effect than the AGC type. With both AGC types, speech intelligibility was lower for the 75 ms release time than for the 625 ms release time. With the shorter release time, the envelope profile limiter provided higher group mean scores than the front-end limiter in quiet, but there was no significant difference in noise. Experiment 2 measured sentence recognition in noise as a function of presentation level, from 55 to 89 dB SPL. The envelope profile limiter with 625 ms release time yielded better scores tha...|$|R
40|$|Stabilizing the {{dynamics}} of complex, non-linear systems {{is a major concern}} across several scientific disciplines including ecology and conservation biology. Unfortunately, most methods proposed to reduce the fluctuations in chaotic systems are not applicable for real, biological populations. This is because such methods typically require detailed knowledge of system specific parameters and the ability to manipulate them in real time; conditions often not met by most real populations. Moreover, real populations are often noisy and extinction-prone, which can sometimes render such methods ineffective. Here we investigate a control strategy, which works by perturbing the population size, and is robust to reasonable amounts of noise and extinction probability. This strategy, <b>called</b> the Adaptive <b>Limiter</b> Control (ALC), has been previously shown to increase constancy and persistence of laboratory populations and metapopulations of Drosophila melanogaster. Here we present a detailed numerical investigation of the effects of ALC on the fluctuations and persistence of metapopulations. We show that at high migration rates, application of ALC does not require a priori information about the population growth rates. We also show that ALC can stabilize metapopulations even when applied to as low as one-tenth {{of the total number of}} subpopulations. Moreover, ALC is effective even when the subpopulations have high extinction rates: conditions under which one other control algorithm has previously failed to attain stability. Importantly, ALC not only reduces the fluctuation in metapopulation sizes, but also the global extinction probability. Finally, the method is robust to moderate levels of noise in {{the dynamics}} and the carrying capacity of the environment. These results, coupled with our earlier empirical findings, establish ALC to be a strong candidate for stabilizing real biological metapopulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} in two parts. In the first, I give {{a method for}} {{constructing}} decidable classes of number theoretic sentences, and in the second, I apply this method {{in the construction of}} particular decidable classes. Let B 0,B 1, [...] be an increasing sequence of finite Boolean algebras of subsets, of the natural numbers, N, such that {lcub}e- 1 {rcub} B limits for all e > 0. We <b>call</b> the Be <b>limiters.</b> We say that e limits a predicate P if the extension of each component of P belongs to We say that a function p(i) limits a function f if the inverse of each component of f maps Bi, into Bpi. By a constituent, we mean either a predicate or a function. We call a set of constituents B effectively limited if there is an effective procedure for obtaining limits, which are recursive in the case of functions, for each constituent in B. By a sentence with constituents B we mean a sentence generated from B and the equations X = 0,X= 1, by substitution, the prepositional operations, bounded and unbounded quantification, and bounded and unbounded u-operations Our main result is that the class of sentences, with a given effectively limited set of recursive constituents, is decidable if b 2 is recursive where b 2 denotes max{lcub}min B : B Be{rcub}. In the second part, we consider several possible sequences of limiters. In each case, we show that be is recursive, and we find as large an effectively limited class B of recursive constituents as we can, so that the class of sentences with constituents B is decidable. In the case of the simplest possible limiters, our work reveals the connection between the apparently unrelated methods, used by Goodstein and Lee and by Rousseau, to determine decidable classes of equations of the form f = 0, and provides a considerable extension of these classes...|$|R
40|$|In today’s {{technological}} world, {{electrical energy}} {{is one of}} the most important forms of energy and is needed directly or indirectly in almost every field. Increase in the demand and consumption of electrical energy leads to increase in the system fault levels. It is not possible to change the rating of the equipment and devices in the system or circuits to accommodate the increasing fault currents. The devices in electronic and electrical circuits are sensitive to disturbance and any disturbance or fault may damage the device permanently so that it must be replaced. The cost of equipment like circuit breakers and transformers in power grids is very expensive. Moreover, replacing damaged equipment is a time and labour consuming process, which also affects the reliability of power systems. It is not possible to completely eliminate the faults but it is possible to limit the current during fault in order to save the equipment and devices in the circuits or systems. One solution to this problem is to use a current limiting device in the system. There are many different types of approaches used for limiting fault currents Two different approaches to limit fault currents have been discussed by the author. One is Passive Magnetic Current Limiter (MCL) and another is High Temperature Superconductor Fault Current Limiter (HTSFCL). Both are passive devices and they do not need any sensor or external sources to perform their current limiting action. The first device consists of two ferrite cores and a permanent magnet which is sandwiched between the two saturated cores and it is <b>called</b> Magnetic Current <b>Limiter.</b> Experimental results with the MCL in circuit are discussed. Both field and thermal models of the MCL have been simulated using finite element software, FEMLAB. The demonstration of the High Temperature Superconductor Fault Current Limiter (HTSFCL) in power systems has been explained. The MATLAB simulation of the HTSFCL has been done and the results with and without the fault are shown. Power System Analysis Toolbox (PSAT) software has been used to locate the optimum or the best location of HTSFCL in a nine bus system. It has been shown that it is possible to find a solution that limits the fault current in power systems. Depending on the size of the system, either the MCL or the HTSFCL can be implemented. The location of the HTSFCL is to be carefully selected to achieve optimum results...|$|R
