We observe 3 D excess micromotion amplitudes of all individual ions inside a Coulomb crystal with nm resolution and prove that the related frequency shifts can be controlled simultaneously at the 10 ^- 19 level. Using this method, we demonstrate regions of 400 μm and 2 mm length in our trap array with time dilation shifts due to micromotion close to 1 × 10 ^- 19 and below 10 ^- 18, respectively.
