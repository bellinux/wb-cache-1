Many tests of asset pricing models address only the pricing predictions. However, these pricing predictions rest on portfolio choice predictions, and the portfolio choice predictions seem obviously wrong. This paper suggests a new approach to asset pricing and portfolio choices, based on unobserved het-erogeneity. This approach yields the standard pricing conclusions of classical models but is consistent with very different portfolio choices. Novel econo-metric tests link the price and portfolio predictions and take account of the general equilibrium effects of sample-size bias. The paper works through the approach in detail for the case of the classical CAPM, producing a model called CAPM+. When these tests are applied to data generated by large-scale laboratory asset markets (which reveal the price/portfolio choice, CAPM+ is not rejected...|$|R

40|$|The article {{discusses}} critical opinions addressed {{at present}} to the UNO by the States and scholars. It was already during the San Francisco conference that the States raised objections to the adopted solutions. After 43 years of its existence, the UNO is still far from fulfilling the hopes which were fostered {{at the time of}} its foundation. The causes of shortcomings may be found in structural and managerial deficiencies. The complexity of the UNO structure influences the dissipation of efforts and makes the coordination more difficult. The waste of means on countless programmes, sub-programmes and projects has often been subject to criticism. The efforts to increase efficiency through establishing organs which were to improve the system failed (eg. Administrative <b>Commitee</b> <b>on</b> Co-ordination, <b>Commitee</b> <b>on</b> Programme and Co-ordination, Joint Inspection Unit). However, those organs helped to record and disclose shortcoming and their sources by way of Publishing critical reports. Managerial problems consist mostly in difficulties with poor professional qualifications of the UNO staff. The view that the professional level decreases constantly is shared by 69 % of diplomats employed in the UNO-affiliated missions. Critical opinions are voiced also with respect to the unreality of projects, declarativity and mere talk present in the UN system. Particular organizations established on regional and political grounds, the number of which grows constantly and at present is close to 330, are far more efficient. The UNO documents indicate that the member-States most often call for the amendments of provisions on the Security Council, and in the first place on its composition and voting system. The author shares the view that multiplying agencies and organs, or abortive attempts to limit the role of superpowers in the Security Council will not bring adequate effects. Little efficiency of the UNO in maintaining the world peace may be eliminated not through a direct structure reform of the system but indirectly through activities aimed at improving the economic situation of the South. The UNO should work out a worldwide welfare programme which would influence indirectly the consolidation of the world peace through increasing the economic level of conflict-generating regions. Such a programme would have to adopt a system of preferences, for the existing free-market rules the disproportions between the North and the South.

40|$|Duplicado com: [URL] Grouting (JG) is a Geotechnical Engineering {{technique}} that {{is characterized by}} a great versatility, being the best solution for several soil treatment improvement problems. However, JG lacks design rules and quality control. As the result, the main JG works are planned from empirical rules that are often too conservative. The development of rational models to simulate the effect of the different parameters involved in the JG process is of primary importance in order to satisfy the binomial safety-economy that is required in any engineering project. In this work, three data mining models, i. e. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Functional Networks (FN), were adapted to predict the Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) of JG laboratory formulations. A comparative study was held, by using a dataset used that was obtained from several studies previously accomplished in University of Minho. We show that the novel data-driven models are able to learn with high accuracy the complex relationships between the UCS of JG laboratory formulations and its contributing factors.

Sentinel lymph nodes are assessed by hematoxylin eosin (HE) and by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The reason of the histopathological analysis of sentinel lymph nodes was to compare histological work up by HE with histological work up by IHC and based on this comparisone find if immunohistochemical examination of sentinel lymph nodes brings benefit to the patients or not. The goals of the histopathological analysis were to compare detection of macrometastases, micrometastases and submicrometastases in sentinel lymph nodes using hematoxylin-eosin examination and immunohistochemical examination according to the Czech Pathological Society guidelines. Between January 1 st 2006 and December 31 st 2008 there were operated 173 patients with 174 breast cancer tumors at the Department of Surgery Pardubice.

40|$|Abstract: Motivated by Bitcoin’s rapid {{appreciation}} {{in recent}} weeks, I examine its historical trading behavior {{to see whether}} it behaves like a traditional sovereign currency. Bitcoin has exchange rate volatility {{an order of magnitude}} higher than the volatilities of widely used currencies, undermining Bitcoin’s usefulness as a unit of account or a store of value. Bitcoin’s daily exchange rates exhibit virtually zero correlation with bona fide currencies, making Bitcoin useless for risk management purposes and exceedingly difficult for its owners to hedge. Bitcoin also lacks access to a banking system with deposit insurance, and it is not used to denominate consumer credit or loan contracts. Bitcoin appears to behave more like a speculative investment than like a currency. Late 2013 became an auspicious time for Bitcoin, a “virtual currency ” launched five years earlier by computer hobbyists. During the month of November 2013, the U. S. Dollar exchange rate for one Bitcoin rose more than fivefold, and the value of one Bitcoin, which had begun trading at less than five cents in 2010, exceeded $ 1, 200. 00.

40|$|Financial risk model {{evaluation}} or backtesting is a {{key part}} of the internal model’s approach to market risk management as laid out by the Basle <b>Commitee</b> <b>on</b> Banking Supervision (1996). However, existing backtesting methods such as those developed in Christoffersen (1998), have relatively small power in realistic small sample settings. Methods suggested in Berkowitz (2001) fare better, but rely on information such as the shape of the left tail of the portfolio return distribution, which is often not available. By far the most common risk measure is Value-at-Risk (V aR), which is defined as a conditional quantile of the return distribution, and it says nothing about the shape of the tail to the left of the quantile. Our contribution is the exploration of a new tool for backtesting based on the duration of days between the violations of the V aR. The chief insight is that if the one-day-ahead V aR model is correctly specified for coverage rate, p, then, every day, the conditional expected duration until the next violation should be a constant 1 /p days. We suggest various ways of testing this null hypothesis and we conduct a Monte Carlo analysis which compares the new tests to those currently available. Our results show that in realistic situations, the duration based tests have better power properties than the previously suggested tests. The size of the tests is easily controlled using the Monte Carlo technique of Dufour (2000). ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the principal {{findings of the}} Working Group on Incentive Structures in Institutional Asset Management set up {{under the aegis of}} the <b>Commitee</b> <b>on</b> the Global Financial System (CGFS). These findings, which have recently been published in a report, aim to give the central bank community – and beyond that, the financial community – a better understanding of ongoing developments in the fund management industry and their potential implications for financial markets. The report, based on a comprehensive literature review and extensive interviews with market practitioners, has identified various features and trends in the industry with a potential effect on the functioning of financial markets. However, as many of these effects are at least partially offsetting, the lack of reliable empirical evidence has not allowed the working group to come to a clear-cut conclusion on the aggregate effect of these various features and trends at the current juncture. Still, one broad conclusion may be drawn from this report: ongoing and future developments in the fund management industry have the potential to change institutional behaviour in ways that can be important for financial markets. This relates to the general issue of preserving the diversity of investment behaviour, and partially results from the fact that parts of the institutional asset management industry have moved towards becoming a «commodity» industry offering investors more and more standardised investments products and approaches. Therefore, developments in the industry may require further attention by the financial community as a whole. More specifically, the report points to four broad areas where particular attention should be paid: risk management and disclosure, conflicts of interest, explicit and implicit barriers to market entry, and regulatory trade-offs. ...|$|R

Purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of procurement related factors <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance. Snowballing sampling technique was used in selecting forty (40) construction organizations in Lagos metropolitan city that participated in the study and thirty-one (31) responses were secured from Architects, Builders, Engineers and Quantity Surveyors. Results of the study indicate that procurement selection criteria of cost, time, quality, project characteristics and external environmental factors have effects <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance. Competitive, open and selective tendering methods have high impacts <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance. No significant difference was found between the impacts of tendering methods <b>on</b> <b>project</b> performance.
