5000|$|The cathedral was {{extensively}} renovated {{beginning in}} 1980 {{under the direction}} of Frank Kacmarcik. The pipe organ was installed in the apse and dedicated in 1984. The Mother of Perpetual Help Shrine in the lower church was destroyed in a fire that did extensive damage to the lower church and smoke damage to the upper church. The lower church was renovated to create a chapel for Mass during the week, as well as a Eucharistic chapel and a gathering space. Five terra cotta disks that portrayed the <b>crux</b> <b>gammata</b> or swastika, an ancient stylized cross, were removed from the exterior of the cathedral in 2006. Because of its association with the Nazi Party in Germany, the parish determined the <b>crux</b> <b>gammata</b> could never recover its association with the Cross of Christ. [...] They were replaced by five new limestone disks that depict the Luminous Mysteries that were composed by Pope John Paul II. The cathedral was refurbished in 2013 with a new floor, interior paint, and refurbishing the pews and kneelers.|$|E
