25|$|The {{elevated}} section {{built with}} <b>concrete</b> <b>girders</b> was not built {{to withstand the}} use of road salt in the winter. The salt created corrosion of the steel within the concrete bents (vertical columns and horizontal caps), which expanded and weakened the steel, and caused pieces of concrete to fall off. Remedial work had to be applied starting in the 1990s {{at a cost of}} $8 million per year. The remedial work included sealing expansion joints to force the salty water into the drains and extensive patching of the concrete columns. Exposed steel was sand-blasted and repainted.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{age and the}} two-lane {{undivided}} roadway and lift-span led to {{a replacement}} bridge, built to the north. This bridge opened in October 1982 as a four-lane, high-level structure. The structure was re-striped to accommodate six lanes on October 18, 1989 {{in response to the}} temporary closing of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge due to the Loma Prieta earthquake, and the permanent widening of the approaches was completed by July 2003. The cost of the complete replacement project was $200 million. The current bridge includes a two-way bicycle and separate pedestrian path on the south-facing side. A [...] center span provides [...] of vertical clearance for shipping. The approach spans {{on both sides of the}} Bay are of pre-stressed lightweight <b>concrete</b> <b>girders</b> supporting a lightweight concrete deck. The center spans are twin steel trapezoidal girders which also support a lightweight concrete deck.

In {{order to}} {{accurately}} determine {{the weight of}} railway bridges parts, for railway <b>concrete</b> <b>girder</b> bridge case, this thesis is based on analysing the construction features of the railway <b>concrete</b> <b>girder</b> bridges and destructive characteristic of seismic damage and proposes a detailed method, which adopts combination of the analytic hierarchy process and the fuzzy synthetical evaluation. The weight of railway <b>concrete</b> <b>girder</b> bridges can be confirmed, by utilizing its logical and pairwise comparison method, Studies show {{that this is an}} effective method to confirm the weight of railway <b>concrete</b> <b>girder</b> bridges.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{evaluating}} the fatigue life of a prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>girder</b> bridge is presented. Experimental studies indicate that fatigue is a random phenomenon. Therefore, the approach is based on probabilistic methods. The fatigue life of the prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>girder</b> is estimated from the fatigue properties of its components, namely, the cast-in-place slab, precast beam, prestressing steel, and, if partially prestressed, the tension reinforcement. The model utilizes the available S-N curves for structural materials and Miner's rule to evaluate the fatigue life under variable amplitude loading. A model for determining the distribution function of time to first cracking is also presented. To demonstrate the developed models, a typical prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>girder</b> bridge is analyzed. On {{the basis of this}} investigation, it is concluded that fatigue in prestressed <b>concrete</b> <b>girder</b> bridges designed acacording to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials specifications is not a limiting design criterion...|$|R

The {{construction}} of high-rise building transfer story <b>concrete</b> <b>girder</b> {{belongs to the}} mass concrete, due to the concrete hydration heat temperature is often beyond the limited temperature, so need to make temperature calculation and temperature control of transfer story <b>concrete</b> <b>girder</b> in the construction process. This paper taking a steel reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>girder</b> of a high-rise building transfer story as an example, using finite difference method to calculate the change rule of concrete temperature field along with age, then using nonlinear analysis program ANSYS simulation the mechanical performance of transfer beam under the action of loads and temperature stress during the construction. Analysis and calculation results should provide technical support for the {{construction of}} the steel reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>girder</b> of the transfer story. Analysis shows that, at intervals of 12 days two laminated pouring of concrete in the construction process, will meet the requirements of temperature control.
