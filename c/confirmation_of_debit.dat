30|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} POS and ATM debit card transactions volumes in Spain, their interactions and their overall impact on the demand for currency. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} paper simultaneously exploring both usages <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards and the effects on the demand for money. From a policy point of view, the use <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards has been identified as one of the main examples of the transition from paper-based to electronic-based systems. 18 However, ATM transactions and POS transactions have opposite effects since the use <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards at ATMs increases cash withdrawals while the use <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards at POS reduces cash holdings for purchasing purposes. In this paper, we use a unique bank-level database for Spain that allows us to identify the issuer (consumer) and acquirer (merchant) sides of the use <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards at POS as well as the number <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> card withdrawals at a bank.|$|R

40|$|Recently {{announced}} {{changes to}} debit card interchange fees {{could lead to}} an increase in the cost <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards to consumers. This brief analyzes the potential effects of an increase in debit card fees or in bank account fees by using the results of the 2008 and 2009 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice (SCPC). The main findings are that: 1) consumers with the least amount of education (less than a high school diploma), the lowest annual income (below $ 25, 000), and the youngest age (under 25 years) consider cost {{to be the most important}} payment characteristic. It is probable that these consumers would be most affected by an increase in debit card fees, and most likely to change their payment behavior in response; 2) the cost <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> seems to be an important factor affecting consumer payment decisions: consumers who rated the cost <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards as low relative to the cost of other payment methods were significantly more likely to adopt and to use debit cards; 3) credit cards were viewed as the closest substitute for debit cards. If the cost <b>of</b> using <b>debit</b> cards rises, consumers are more likely to substitute credit cards for some <b>of</b> their <b>debit</b> card transactions; 4) consumer reaction depends on the type of fee increases: an increase in the cost <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards specifically is expected to have a greater effect on debit card use than a broader increase in the cost of maintaining bank accounts; and 5) an increase in the one-time cost <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> card setup could lead to a substantial decrease in the rate <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> adoption.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{innovation}} in transaction technology may modify the cash holding behaviour <b>of</b> agents, as <b>debit</b> card holders may either withdraw cash from ATMs or purchase items using POS devices at retailers. In this paper, within the Rubin Causal Model, we investigate the causal effects of the use <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards on the cash inventories held by households using data from the Italy Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW). We adopt the principal stratification approach to incorporate the share <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> card holders who do not use this payment instrument. We use a regression model with the propensity score as the single predictor to adjust for the imbalance in observed covariates. We further develop a sensitivity analysis approach to assess the sensitivity of the proposed model to violation to the key unconfoundedness assumption. Our empirical results suggest statistically significant negative effects <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards on the household cash level in Italy. Comment: 29 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Moreover, {{it turns out that the}} use of multiple payment media is directly related to consumer awareness but that not controlling for the endogeneity of awareness can bias its effect downwards.

30|$|The {{exclusion}} {{restrictions that}} identify Eq. (1)—where the acquirer change in transaction volume per POS terminal with debit cards (ACTVPOS) is the dependent variable—are the merchant debit card discount fee and the debit card annual fee—which {{are expected to}} be negatively related to merchant transaction volumes- and an interaction term of the merchant acceptance and the total number <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards in that network. This interaction captures the network effects as ACTVPOS is expected to increase when the number of merchants served by the acquirer increases or the number <b>of</b> total <b>debit</b> cards increases. The exclusion restriction for ICTVDC corresponds to the annual debit card fee and the network effects shown by the interaction term of the merchant acceptance in the network and the number of cards issued by the bank. It {{is important to note that}} only 6  % of banks in the sample charge an annual fee for debit cards. 6 Even so, we exploit such variation to infer the impact <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> card fees on acquirer (Eq.  1) and issuer (Eq.  2) volumes. As for Eq. (3) the exclusion restrictions also include a price for that side <b>of</b> the market—the <b>debit</b> card ATM fees- and the interaction of the number <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards in the network and the number of ATMs by issuer, which is expected to show ATM network effects.|$|R

30|$|Debit {{cards are}} {{employed}} for cash withdrawals at automated teller machines (ATMs) and for purchasing transactions at point-of-sale (POS). In this paper, we explore, {{for the first}} time to our knowledge, the determinants <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> card transaction volumes at ATM and POS, the relationship between these two alternative usages of cards and its impact on the demand for currency. We employ a unique database that considers the two-sided nature <b>of</b> <b>debit</b> cards to explore these issues. The results suggest that the intensity of the use of ATMs and POS have a large economic impact one on another. We also find a net negative effect <b>of</b> transactions with <b>debit</b> cards on the demand for currency since the positive impact of ATM usage is lower in absolute terms than the negative effect of POS volumes.|$|R
