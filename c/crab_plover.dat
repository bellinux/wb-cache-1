50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{incubation}} habits is displayed among birds. In warm-blooded species such as bird species generally, body heat from the brooding parent provides the constant temperature, though several groups, notably the megapodes, instead use heat generated from rotting vegetable material, effectively creating a giant compost heap while <b>crab</b> <b>plovers</b> make partial use of heat from the sun. The Namaqua sandgrouse of the deserts of southern Africa, needing to keep its eggs cool during {{the heat of the}} day, stands over them drooping its wings to shade them. The humidity is also critical, because if the air is too dry the egg will lose too much water to the atmosphere, which can make hatching difficult or impossible. As incubation proceeds, an egg will normally become lighter, and the air space within the egg will normally become larger, owing to evaporation from the egg.|$|R

To univocally and automatically analyse the large volume of data generated, we need classification models. An important {{step in the process}} of classification is the segmentation of acceleration data, i. e. the assignment of the boundaries between different behavioural classes in a time series.

Here we develop random forest automated supervised classification models either built on variable-time segments generated with a so-called ‘change-point model’, or on fixed-time segments, and compare for eight behavioural classes the classification performance. The approach makes use of acceleration data measured in eight free-ranging <b>crab</b> <b>plovers</b> Dromas ardeola. Results Useful classification was achieved by both the variable-time and fixed-time approach for flying (89 % vs. 91 %, respectively), walking (88 % vs. 87 %) and body care (68 % vs. 72 %). By using the variable-time segment approach, significant gains in classification performance were obtained for inactive behaviours (95 % vs. 92 %) and for two major foraging activities, i. e. handling (84 % vs. 77 %) and searching (78 % vs. 67 %). Attacking a prey and pecking were never accurately classified by either method. Conclusion Acceleration-based behavioural classification can be optimized using a variable-time segmentation approach. After implementing variable-time segments to our sample data, we achieved useful levels of classification performance for almost all behavioural classes. This enables behaviour, including motion, to be set in known spatial contexts, and the measurement of behavioural time-budgets of free-living birds with unprecedented coverage and precision. The methods developed here can be easily adopted in other studies, but we emphasize that for each species and set of questions, the presented string of work steps should be run through...|$|R

50|$|Broadcast 23 December 1998, {{the final}} {{programme}} investigates {{the challenges that}} must be surmounted if birds are to survive. The sandgrouse is a species that has adapted to desert living: its breast feathers are capable of absorbing water, which it can pass on to its young. The <b>crab</b> <b>plover</b> also nests in the sand, and burrows until it finds a comfortable temperature. Birds that choose remote places can proliferate hugely, like the flamingos on an African soda lake. Meanwhile, during winter, the entire world population of spectacled eiders {{can be found in}} just a few assemblies on patches of the Arctic Ocean. The city is a relatively recent habitat, but many have become accustomed to it, such as the American black vultures in São Paulo. In Japan, crows have learned to crack nuts by dropping them on to pedestrian crossings — and waiting for the traffic to stop before collecting them. In North America, purple martins have become totally dependent on humans for their nest sites. Attenborough highlights man's influence by describing the Pacific island of Guam, whose bird population was wiped out following the accidental introduction of brown tree snakes during the 1940s. Examples of species that were hunted to extinction are the huia, the great auk and, most famously, the dodo. However, there are conservation efforts being made, such as those for Australia's orange-bellied parrot, the pink pigeon and the echo parakeet (the latter two both of Mauritius).|$|E

The Maximum breeding population of Lesser Crested Tern Sterna bengalensis was 11, 783 pairs in 2012 in Nakhiloo, and Swift Tern Sterna bergii was estimated at 2, 500 pairs in 2008.

40|$|The phylogenetic {{placement}} of the monotypic <b>crab</b> <b>plover</b> Dromas ardeola (Aves, Charadriiformes) remains controversial. Phylogenetic analysis of anatomical and behavioral traits using phenetic and cladistic methods of tree inference have resulted in conflicting tree topologies, suggesting a close association of Dromas to members of different suborders and lineages within Charadriiformes.

Our results suggest that Bayesian analysis of anatomical characters does not resolve the phylogenetic relationship of shorebirds with strong statistical support.

40|$|Conservation biology uses various tools {{including}} spatial {{ecology and}} molecular ecology to provide {{better understanding of}} species {{that can be used}} to support and design effective conservation strategies. Many wetland bird species in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) are poorly known, and we lack detailed knowledge about their breeding ecology, spatial distribution and genetic differentiation. The first objective of my PhD research was to investigate the parental behaviour of an understudied endemic shorebird to the Middle East, the <b>Crab</b> <b>Plover</b> Dromas ardeola to record parental behaviour at the burrows over a 24 -hour period. Since adult males and females look identical, I used molecular markers for sex determination. Molecular sexing was conducted using two different markers applied for 66 <b>Crab</b> <b>Plover</b> blood samples. I demonstrated that both males and females fed chicks, and that females brought food to chicks more frequently than did males (Chapter 2). The second objective was to investigate the breeding distribution of Crab Plovers along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia and to compare the results with the last comprehensive survey conducted in 1996. I showed that the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia has approximately 35 % of the Arabian breeding population of Crab Plovers. The major threats to this species along the Red Sea coast were also discussed (Chapter 3). The third objective was to model the spatial distribution of 22 wetland bird species along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) based on occurrence data and 10 environmental variables and then to determine sites with high species richness. This analysis identified 17 areas predicted to be suitable for supporting high species richness. I recommended using this model of areas with high wetland bird species richness as a guide for monitoring and surveys to inform conservation strategies in the Red Sea region of the KSA (Chapter 4). The fourth objective was to use microsatellite markers to investigate the genetics and morphometric differentiations of a wide-spread shorebird species, the Kentish Plover, between islands and mainland sites. The main result of the latter investigation was that breeding populations are genetically and morphometrically differentiated between mainland sites and islands, as well as between different archipelagos. This finding calls for a reconsideration of the current conservation status of this species (Chapter 5). Finally, my PhD research has generated several research lines that warrant further investigation (Chapter 6) ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Crab</b> <b>Plover</b> Dromas ardeola is {{endemic to}} the Indian Ocean basin and breeds on islands around the Arabian Peninsula. Unique among shorebirds, it nests in an {{underground}} burrow where it lays a single white egg and feeds one chick. We investigated sex-related differences in body size and parental {{care of this}} species in Saudi Arabia. Molecular sexing of DNA samples of 66 adult Crab Plovers indicated that 26 were males and 40 were females. Males had significantly longer bill, wing and tarsus lengths than females, confirming previously published reports on sexual size dimorphism in Eritrea. Observations of molecular-sexed adults at four nests showed that both parents fed the chicks; however, females brought food to the nest-burrow more often than males (67. 6 % of all cases). We found that the temperature inside active nesting burrows was relatively stable at 35. 0 ±SE= 0. 18 °C (n = 11 nests) regardless of ambient temperature just outside the burrows. This suggests that burrows serve a purpose in incubation {{as well as in}} defence from predation. In the colony, adults were seen to prevent chicks from multiple burrows from leaving the nest when their own parents had left the colony, confirming a helper breeding system. We suggest areas for future investigation to further elucidate the breeding behaviour of this enigmatic and unique burrowing shorebird...|$|E
