40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 {{s global}} economy, firms are seeking any and every {{opportunity}} to differentiate from competitors by reducing supply chain costs and adding value to end customers. One increasingly popular option, under growing consumer awareness and increasing legislation, is to reintegrate returned products into the supply chain to achieve economic benefits as well as improve sustainability. An important class of such 2 ̆ 2 reverse 2 ̆ 2 goods flows {{has to do with}} remanufacturing (reman), which refers to activities that restore returned products (2 ̆ 2 cores 2 ̆ 2) or their major modules to operational condition for using in place of new product or distributing through other channels (e. g., spare parts). While opportunities abound, some key complications reported in the literature include: 1) difficulty in timing the launch of reman product (while accounting for uncertainties associated with product life-cycle demand and core supply), 2) difficulty with capacity planning for remanufacturing (while accounting for the fact that volumes can be low and that facilities/lines should target multiple product families for economies of scale), and 3) operational difficulties in maintaining efficiencies in production planning and control of remanufacturing activities. These difficulties are mostly attributable to limited visibility and higher levels of uncertainty in reverse logistics (in comparison with forward logistics). Despite advances in the remanufacturing literature {{in the last two decades}} (both in the academic literature and practitioner community), there is no integrated decision support framework that can guide companies to successful launch and execution of remanufacturing operations. This is particularly true for companies that engage in both original equipment (OE) service as well as the independent after-market (IAM) in the automotive industry. This research aims to address these limitations by developing a decision support framework and necessary models for effective remanufacturing in the automotive industry. At the strategic level, we propose a unified approach to explicitly model and address issues of capacities as well timing the launch of remanufacturing programs for new product. We derive the optimal remanufacturing policy and extensively studied the drivers of cost-effective remanufacturing program for aftermarket services. Our policies exploit the ability to leverage OE production to support both the OE service operations as well as demand from the IAM. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first attempt of its kind in the remanufacturing literature, as prior research treated these interrelated decisions separately. Valuable managerial insights are obtained by minimizing the discounted cash outflows caused by appropriate investment and <b>core</b> <b>return</b> inventory building decisions. We show that, under certain conditions, it may be optimal to delay the launch of the remanufacturing program to build up an adequate initial <b>core</b> <b>return</b> inventory. This may help in perfectly substituting virgin parts with remanufactured parts after end of the OE production run. At operational level, efficient production planning and control of reman parts for the supplier heavily impinges on the ability to accurately forecast core returns from customers (e. g., dealers, distributors). There are several challenges to this, including, the volume and diversity of customers served by the supplier, differences among individual customer warehouses in returning cores, large reman product catalogs, changing customer behaviors (often improving <b>core</b> <b>return</b> delays), and data sparsity. In this research we report the evidence for the effectiveness of hazard rate regression models to estimate <b>core</b> <b>return</b> delays in the context of remanufacturing. We investigate a number of hazard rate modelling techniques (e. g., parametric, semi-parametric etc.) using real-world datasets from a leading Tier- 1 automotive supplier. Results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of stability and face validity of the estimates and in predictive accuracy...|$|E

40|$|The {{results are}} {{summarized}} as follows : 1. Around secondary follicles {{in the last}} stage and also around vesicular follicles in the early stage, a single layer of coarse capillary network {{is found in the}} form of a flattened wreath. At the late middle stage of vesicular follicles the vascular wreath become arranged in two layers, consisting of an outer layer of small vessels with arborization branches and an inner of coarse capillary network. The mature follicles have also two vascular wreaths. 2. In mature follicles, especially in ones just before rupture, capillaries of the inner wreath form a remarkable network appearing in spotted maculae on the inner surface of the theca interna. 3. Around cystic atretic follicles at the second stage a double wreath of blood vessels is found, but in the inner wreath capillary network is partially lacking. Along with the atretic process, the capillary network in the inner wreath decreases gradually and at last disappears completely. Meanwhile, arterioles and venules also decrease gradually. 4. The vascular pattern of non-pregnant corpora lutea at the bloom stage and that of the mature pregnant corpora lutea is similar except for a few details. That is to say, the capillary network of corpora lutea is arranged in lobules. The small arteries from large vessels in the outer side of the corpora lutea run straight into the corpora lutea along the interlobular spaces, and near the central <b>core</b> <b>return</b> and stretch again into the substances of the corpora lutea toward the periphery, branching off capillaries which form a detase network. There is no recurrence in veins, unlike arteries, but they take the course of ordinary veins. 5. In regressing corpora lutea the capillaries disappear first. Small vessels remain for a relatively long while and leave the vestige of vascular arrangement of fully-formed corpora lutea. 6. The vascular arrangement of vascular bodies was ascertained stereoangiographically. It was proved that numerous, thick and distorted arterioles remaind as the main constituent of vascular bodies, while most of the capillaries were not found...|$|E

We firstly identify and study how to break the symmetries introduced by the blocking variables and cardinality constraints. Secondly, we study how to prioritize the discovery of higher quality cores.

40|$|AbstractThe bubble-type vortex {{breakdown}} inside a cylinder with flow driven by {{rotation of the}} base, has applications in mixing. We investigate this phenomena {{and its effect on}} the environment inside an open cylinder, with potential application as a tissue-engineering bioreactor, with tissue-scaffolds of two different geometries immersed in the fluid. Addition of scaffolds induces a blockage effect, hindering the flow in the central vortex <b>core</b> <b>returning</b> to the rotating base. This promotes early onset of {{vortex breakdown}} and alters the final shape of vortex breakdown bubbles. Placement of the scaffolds centrally on the cylinder axis yields almost identical levels and distributions of shear stress between the upper and lower surfaces of scaffolds. A change from a disk shaped to an ellipsoidal scaffold, of the same size, reduces the intensity of the maximum shear stresses at the scaffold surface by up to 50 %. There is a range of Reynolds numbers where increasing Reynolds number, and hence possibly increasing mixing efficiency, leads to a decrease in the maximum levels of fluid forces at the scaffold surfaces. This is an important conclusion for scaffold based tissue engineering where improved mixing is sought, but often sacrificed in favor of minimizing fluid forces...|$|R
