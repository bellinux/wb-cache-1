5|$|The October 17 {{press release}} set November 21, 2006 as the North American {{distribution}} {{date for the}} Xbox 360 and PC versions of Knights of the Nine. The European release for the Xbox 360 and PC was set two days later, on November 23. The European release was co-published by Bethesda and Ubisoft. On November 9, 2006, Bethesda clarified earlier statements regarding PC releases, declaring that, although the boxed retail PC edition of Knights of the Nine was set for release on November 21, the PC release downloadable from the company website wouldn't be available until December 4. This caused some <b>consumer</b> <b>complaints,</b> for although the Xbox 360 release was available on the Xbox Live Marketplace for 800 Microsoft Points (the equivalent of US$10.00, or GB£6.80), for the time being, PC owners had only the US$19.99 boxed retail edition of the game. The increased price of the PC's boxed retail release (The Elder Scrolls IV: Knights of Nine Oblivion Downloadable Content Collection) resulted from its inclusion of Oblivions other previously released downloadable content. Such content {{was not included in}} either the downloadable PC release, the Xbox Marketplace download, or the PlayStation 3 edition of Oblivion. The downloadable release was ultimately issued on December 6 at the price of US$9.99. According to IGN Entertainment's GamerMetrics, a service based on compiled visitor activity information on IGN's website, the pack was the fourth most anticipated release of its release week, following , Superman Returns and College Hoops 2K7.|$|E

500|$|Fujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, {{as well as}} others, {{researching the}} kind of {{motorcycle}} Fujisawa had in mind. [...] Fujisawa said these designs had [...] "no future" [...] and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common <b>consumer</b> <b>complaints</b> of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use {{would have to be}} addressed. Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. The scooter type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden with one hand while carrying a tray of soba noodles, saying to Honda, [...] "If you can design a small motorcycle, say 50cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside, I can sell it. I don't know how many soba noodle shops there are in Japan, but I bet you that every shop will want one for deliveries." ...|$|E

40|$|Although {{there is}} immense {{international}} support for consumer protection; the notion exists that consumer protection can only exist in developed countries with ample fiscal resources and expertise to properly act {{in the interest of}} consumers. This conception leaves consumers in emerging and transitional economies in a difficult position as these economies indeed generally lack sufficient funding and the required capacity to educate consumers on their rights (Donoghue & De Klerk, 2009). With the new South African Consumer Protection Act that came into effect in 2011; South African consumers can now claim to be among the best protected consumers in the world. It is, however, an undeniable fact that South African consumers are often still unaware of their rights, while very little is known about dissatisfied consumers’ cognitions and complaint behaviour following dissatisfaction with the performance of complicated and expensive products. Although substantial literature could be found on consumers’ attitudes towards consumerism (consumer protection), consumers’ dissatisfaction with consumer products and <b>consumer</b> <b>complaint</b> behaviour in general in developed and developing countries, no empirical studies could be found that link consumers’ knowledge of and attitudes towards consumerism with their <b>consumer</b> <b>complaint</b> behaviour regarding dissatisfactory consumer products in a South African context. The objective of this research was therefore to explore and describe the relationship between consumers’ knowledge of consumerism and <b>consumer</b> <b>complaint</b> behaviour and the relationship between attitudes towards consumerism and <b>consumer</b> <b>complaint</b> behaviour concerning their dissatisfaction with products. The respondents’ perceived level of severity of the consumer electronics’ performance failure was also explored. This study used a survey approach. Convenience sampling was employed in Tshwane, South Africa, which generated 351 usable responses. For inclusion in the study, respondents had to have experienced dissatisfaction with the performance of a consumer electronic product within a 12 month memory recall period. The study was quantitative in nature as well as cross-sectional as it explored and described consumers’ knowledge of and attitudes towards consumerism, and their subsequent <b>consumer</b> <b>complaint</b> behaviour in the Tshwane region, as well as their perceived levels of severity of the consumer electronic product failure. The data was collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire. Consumers’ knowledge of consumerism was measured and explained in terms of the subjective and objective dimensions of knowledge. Consumers’ attitudes toward consumerism were measured by using an adapted version of Barksdale and Darden’s (1972) Attitudes toward Marketing and Consumerism Scale. Higher levels of knowledge could be associated with complaint behaviour, but attitudes towards consumerism did not play a role in <b>consumer</b> <b>complaint</b> behaviour. The respondents’ perceived levels of the severity of the consumer electronic products’ performance failure did not influence the type of complaint action taken. The study has implications for policy makers, consumer protection organisations and retailers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore any {{connections}} that may exist between personality types and <b>consumer</b> <b>complaint</b> channels. A sample of 490 undergraduate students at the University of Nevada Las Vegas was surveyed during class time with a paper and pencil survey. The survey consisted of four service failure scenarios each with eleven possible courses of action. Respondents were asked to rate their likelihood to participate in each action on a seven point Likert-type scale. The three personality factors measured against the complaint behavior were Locus of Control, The California Psychological Inventory measure of Sociability, and Cattel 2 ̆ 7 s 16 personality factor of Relaxed vs. Tense. The three factors of <b>consumer</b> <b>complaint</b> channels proposed prior to conducting the study were; direct, indirect, and delayed. Through factor analysis it was revealed that while three factors existed, it was not the factors originally proposed. The three factors that emerged were; active, passive, and delayed. It was found that both Sociability and the interaction of Relaxed vs. Tense have significant or marginally significant effect on <b>consumer</b> <b>complaint</b> channels. Sociability had a measurable effect of several active and one passive factor in complaint scenarios. The interaction of Locus of Control and Relaxed vs. Tense had a measurable effect on two passive and two delayed factors in the complaint scenarios...|$|R
