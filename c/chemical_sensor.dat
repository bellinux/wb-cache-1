50|$|A <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor</b> is a {{self-contained}} analytical device {{that can provide}} information about the chemical composition of its environment, that is, a liquid or a gas phase. The information is provided {{in the form of}} a measurable physical signal that is correlated with the concentration of a certain chemical species (termed as analyte). Two main steps are involved in the functioning of a <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor,</b> namely, recognition and transduction. In the recognition step, analyte molecules interact selectively with receptor molecules or sites included in the structure of the recognition element of the sensor. Consequently, a characteristic physical parameter varies and this variation is reported by means of an integrated transducer that generates the output signal.A <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor</b> based on recognition material of biological nature is a biosensor. However, as synthetic biomimetic materials are going to substitute to some extent recognition biomaterials, a sharp distinction between a biosensor and a standard <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor</b> is superfluous. Typical biomimetic materials used in sensor development are molecularly imprinted polymers and aptamers.|$|E

Fundamental concepts of infrared spectroscopy and optical <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> are briefly described, before presenting some aspects on optical <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors,</b> such as synthesis of NIR and IR reagents, preparation of new materials as well as application in determinations of species of biological, industrial and environmental importance...|$|R
40|$|This review {{focuses on}} <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> based on {{cyclodextrin}} (CD) derivatives. This {{has been a}} field of classical interest, and is now of current interest for numerous scientists. First, typical <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> using chromophore appended CDs are mentioned. Various Ã¢Â€Âœturn-offÃ¢Â€Â and Ã¢Â€Âœturn-onÃ¢Â€Â fluorescent <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors,</b> in which fluorescence intensity was decreased or increased by complexation with guest molecules, respectively, were synthesized. Dye modified CDs and photoactive metal ion-ligand complex appended CDs, metallocyclodextrins, were also applied for <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors.</b> Furthermore, recent novel approaches to chemical sensing systems using supramolecular structures such as CD dimers, trimers and cooperative binding systems of CDs with the other macrocycle [2]rotaxane and supramolecular polymers consisting of CD units are mentioned. New <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> using hybrids of CDs with p-conjugated polymers, peptides, DNA, nanocarbons and nanoparticles are also described in this review...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of microsystems in which chemical measurements {{play a role}} make the on-chip combination of <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> and signal processing circuitry highly desirable. <b>Chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> use sensitive layers which are {{not a part of}} MOS devices and in this sense, the determination of the best sensors and technological processes to achieve good integrated smart sensors is very important. In this paper a study of compatibility of ISFET <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> and CMOS circuitry is presented for application to biomedical microsystems. Postprint (published version...|$|R

50|$|The suite {{included}} a mast-mounted, long-range optoelectronic infrared sensor, an emitter mapping sensor for radio frequency interception and direction finding, <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor</b> and a multifunction radio frequency sensor.|$|E
50|$|Sensors convert {{information}} from the environment into interpretable electrical signals. One example of a micromachine sensor is a resonant <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor.</b> A lightly damped mechanical object vibrates much more at one frequency than any other, and this frequency is called its resonance frequency. A <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor</b> is coated with a special polymer that attracts certain molecules, such as those found in anthrax, and when those molecules attach to the sensor, its mass increases. The increased mass alters the resonance frequency of the mechanical object, which is detected with circuitry.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the disadvantages of single nanorod <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors,</b> recently the use of vertically aligned nanorod arrays (NRAs) in <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> has been attempted [18 – 20]. In these works, metal electrodes were simply deposited on top of nanorod arrays using sputtering [18, 20] or aerosol spray pyrolysis [19]. However, this approach is {{likely to result in}} not distinctive but gradient interfaces between nanorods and metal electrodes, possibly deteriorating sensor efficiency. Therefore, an approach for fabricating <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> based on ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs) using more reliable electrode configurations needs to be developed.|$|R
40|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> are {{typically}} discrete elements, each sensitive {{to a particular}} odor. Current chemical sensing systems are unable to detect {{a wide range of}} chemicals. Moreover, the lack of an integrated sensor technology prevents the fabrication large arrays of <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors.</b> A sensing technology is presented that integrates <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> based on conducting carbon black particles and polymers with standard integrated circuit technology. An integrated circuit for array sensing is presented. The necessary post processing steps, consisting of and electroless gold deposition and subsequent polymer deposition, are discussed. The system is demonstrated to function as an array of individually addressable <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors.</b> In addition, a novel nonvolatile analog storage element based on floating gates is presented. The application of this circuit and floating gate adaptation to ratiometric sensing is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe poor {{selectivity}} {{of most of}} {{the current}} <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> is a major problem that limits their application fields.

40|$|A {{portable}} and {{low cost}} measuring system for amperometric <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> using the three-electrodetechnique was developed. This technique allows <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> {{to work with}} currents higher than tenmicroamperes. The system {{was based on a}} potentiostat operation, completed with an I-V converter andsignal conditioning circuits. The instrument was evaluated comparing calibration curves of hydrogen peroxide,proving several amperometric <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> and biosensors, to those obtained from a very expensivecommercial equipment. Good linearity and sensibility as well as low noise measurements were obtained. Moreover, because the reduced size and low cost, the instrument allows to be used directly in fieldapplications...|$|R
40|$|In the past, new devices, {{so called}} "electronic noses", {{have been the}} object of {{scientific}} presentations. But it is still only expensive gas chromatographic applications that are used for flavour research, because <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> have often shown deficiencies in selectivity, sensitivity and reproducibility. Since initial studies in 1997 (Schieberle et al., 1997) the HRGC/SOMSA device {{has been used for}} the detection of odour-active substances in food (Schieberle et al., 1998). This coupling of gas chromatography with an array of <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> enables the characterisation and/or the selection of suitable <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors.</b> In addition, it is possible to distinguish between odour-active and odour-inactive volatiles...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these applications, many applications have been developed based on array processing techniques: Acoustic Beamforming for Hearing Aid Applications, Under-determined Blind Source Separation Using Acoustic Arrays, Digital 3D/4D Ultrasound Imaging Array, Smart Antennas, Synthetic aperture radar, underwater acoustic imaging, and <b>Chemical</b> <b>sensor</b> arrays...etc.|$|E
50|$|ChemFET, or {{chemical}} field-effect transistor, {{is a type}} of a field-effect transistor acting as a <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor.</b> It is a structural analog of a MOSFET transistor, where the charge on the gate electrode is applied by a chemical process. It may be used to detect atoms, molecules, and ions in liquids and gases.|$|E

40|$|Optical <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> have {{promoted}} escalating {{interest in}} the determination of various pollutants in the environment, which are creating toxicity and may cause serious health problems. This review paper focuses particularly on the recent progress and developments in this field; the working principles and basic classes of optical <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> have been briefly described...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} way {{of applying}} <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> {{is in an}} open-loop configuration. A parameter of the chemical domain, such as a gas or ion concentration, is converted into a parameter of the mechanical or electrical domain, often with non-linear transfer characteristics. The paramagnetic oxygen sensor and the ISFET-based urea sensor are treated as typical examples. Such an open-loop procedure is inconceivable in modern electronic and control systems, where the application of feedback is common practice. The question may arise why this principle is hardly adopted {{in the development of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors,</b> to stabilize the signal conversion and to linearize the sensor functioning. Based on the analysis of a transistor V-I converter in open-loop and closed-loop configurations, the successful performance of feedback {{in the case of the}} paramagnetic oxygen sensor and the ISFET-based urea sensor is analysed. That most other <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> are still used in an open-loop configuration is obviously due to the lack of chemical actuators that can be integrated with the corresponding <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors.</b> It is therefore stated that it will be important to pay more attention to the development of chemical actuators in order to make progress in the field of <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R

50|$|EOT-based {{chemical}} sensing {{is another}} major area of research. Much {{like in a}} traditional surface plasmon resonance sensor, the EOT efficiency varies with the wavelength of the incident light, {{and the value of}} the in-plane wavevector component. This can be exploited as a means of transducing chemical binding events by measuring a change in the local dielectric constant (due to binding of the target species) as a shift in the spectral location of the EOT peak. EOT offers one key advantage over a Kretschmann-style SPR <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor,</b> that of being an inherently nanometer-micrometer scale device; it is therefore particularly amenable to miniaturization.|$|E

40|$|Recognition elements, {{also known}} as target receptors, are {{important}} parts of <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> and biosensors since {{they are responsible for}} the recognition of target analytes of interest. Although recent recognition elements were synthesized in the laboratory or selected in vitro, their combination with nanomaterials also aroused the interest of researchers due to improvements in the analytical performance of <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> and biosensors {{as a consequence of the}} enhanced properties of such nanostructures. This review discusses recent developments in recognition elements, both classical, such as enzymes and antibodies, and recent, such as aptamers and phages, integrated into <b>chemical</b> <b>sensors</b> and biosensors in the food, clinical and environmental fields...|$|R

50|$|A <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor</b> can be {{obtained}} by coating a recognition receptor layer over the upper side of a microcantilever beam. A typical application is the immunosensor based on an antibody layer that interacts selectively with a particular immunogen and reports about its content in a specimen. In the static mode of operation, the sensor response is represented by the beam bending with respect to a reference microcantilever. Alternatively, microcantilever sensors can be operated in the dynamic mode. In this case, the beam vibrates at its resonance frequency and a variation in this parameter indicates the concentration of the analyte.|$|E
50|$|Stimuli-responsive gels (hydrogels, {{when the}} {{swelling}} agent is an aqueous solution) are {{a special kind}} of swellable polymer networks with volume phase transition behaviour. These materials change reversibly their volume, optical, mechanical and other properties by very small alterations of certain physical (e.g. electric field, light, temperature) or chemical (concentrations) stimuli. The volume change of these materials occurs by swelling/shrinking and is diffusion-based. Gels provide the biggest change in volume of solid-state materials. Combined with an excellent compatibility with micro fabrication technologies, especially stimuli-responsive hydrogels are of strong increasing interest for microsystems with sensors and actuators. Current fields of research and application are <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor</b> systems, microfluidics and multimodal imaging systems.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example is}} the pH-sensitive LAPS (range pH4 to pH10) that uses LEDs in {{combination}} with (semi-conducting) silicon and pH-sensitive Ta2O5 (SiO2; Si3N4) insulator. The LAPS has several advantages over other types of chemical sensors. The sensor surface is completely flat, no structures, wiring or passivation are required. At the same time, the [...] "light-addressability" [...] of the LAPS {{makes it possible to}} obtain a spatially resolved map of the distribution of the ion concentration in the specimen. The spatial resolution of the LAPS is an important factor and is determined by the beam size and the lateral diffusion of photocarries in the semiconductor substrate. By illuminating parts of the semiconductor surface, electron-hole pairs are generated and a photocurrent flows. The LAPS is a semiconductor based <b>chemical</b> <b>sensor</b> with an electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) structure. Under a fixed bias voltage, the AC (kHz range) photocurrent signal varies depending of the solution. A two-dimensional mapping of the surface from the LAPS is possible by using a scanning laser beam.|$|E
