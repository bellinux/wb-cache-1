2500|$|Once an {{instrumental}} track was completed, vocals {{would then be}} overdubbed by the group. <b>Carl</b> <b>said</b> about the Beach Boys' vocal arrangements: [...] "Our vocals were voiced like horn parts, the way those R records make background vocals sound like a sax section. It sounded big, because the four parts were all within the same octave; {{that was really the}} secret. He used a lot of counterpoint, a lot of layered sound; it had a real depth to it. We didn’t just duplicate parts; we didn’t just sing at octaves; that would sound really lame, very square." ...|$|E
2500|$|The name Pet Sounds was Love's invention, {{according}} to himself, Brian, and Jardine. Brian {{explained that the}} album was named [...] "after the dogs... That was the whole idea", and that the title was a [...] "tribute" [...] to Spector by matching his initials (PS), but could not recall who thought {{of going to the}} zoo. Love recounted: [...] "We were standing in the hallway in one of the recording studios, either Western or Columbia, and we didn't have a title.... We had taken pictures at the zoo and... there were animal sounds on the record, and we were thinking, well, it's our favorite music of that time, so I said, 'Why don't we call it Pet Sounds?'" [...] Brian has also credited Carl for the title, while <b>Carl</b> <b>said</b> with uncertainty that it might have come from Brian: [...] "The idea he [...] had was that everybody has these sounds that they love, and this was a collection of his 'pet sounds.' It was hard to think of a name for the album, because you sure couldn't call it Shut Down Vol. 3.. It was just so much more than a record; it had such a spiritual quality. It wasn't going in and doing another top ten. It had so much more meaning than that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh Yes. Sure. I {{do think}} so, myself." [...] <b>Carl</b> <b>said</b> {{it with a}} {{spurious}} society manner. In Gertie's aristocratic presence he desired to keep aloof from all vulgar persons.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, thunder----!" [...] was all <b>Carl</b> <b>said,</b> as {{the whole}} group stared at him. He felt ridiculous; {{he was afraid of}} seeming to be a [...] "crank." [...] He escaped from the drug-store.|$|E

6000|$|... "A prisoner," [...] <b>Carl</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "whom {{the captain}} has {{appointed}} to the honourable office of cook instead of old Rollo, whose food gets harder and tougher every day. You are to keep a sharp eye over the lad, who says he is a Scotch officer of the Swedes, and to shoot him down if he attempts to escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish we {{were going}} off with her--maybe to Singapore or Nagasaki," [...] <b>Carl</b> <b>said,</b> {{slipping}} his arm through hers, as they balanced on the stringpiece of the wharf, sniffing like deer at the breeze, which for a moment seemed to bear, from distant burgeoning woods, a shadowy hint of burning leaves--the perfume of spring and autumn, the eternal wander-call.|$|E
5000|$|... Foreign Minister <b>Carl</b> Bildt <b>said</b> [...] "the {{arrest of}} Karadžić was a major, if long overdue victory for {{international}} justice. This is late, late, late, but good, good, good".|$|R

60|$|They {{burst out}} on a grassy {{woodland}} road and lay down, panting. They could see a strip of stars overhead; and the world was dark, silent, in the inscrutable night of autumn. <b>Carl</b> <b>said</b> nothing. He tried to make out where they were--where this road would take them. It might run deeper into the woods, {{which he did not}} know as he did the Arch environs; and he had so twisted through the brush that he could not tell in what direction lay either the main wagon-road or the M. & D. track.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{told the}} captain his story, and he {{believed}} it," [...] <b>Carl</b> <b>said</b> carelessly, [...] "and the captain is not easily taken in. He was captured by Tilly at New Brandenburg, which town we heard yesterday he assaulted and sacked, killing every man of the garrison; but it seems this boy put on a disguise, and being but a boy I suppose passed unnoticed, and was taken off as a teamster with Tilly's army. He gave them the slip, but as {{he has managed to}} fall into our hands I don't know that he has gained much by the exchange. Now, youngster, go up to the castle." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Carl</b> <b>said</b> nothing; did not budge. He peeped at {{the ledge}} above him. It {{was too far}} for him to reach it. He tried to discern {{the mass of the}} ground in the {{confusing}} darkness below. It seemed miles down. He {{did not know what to}} do. He was lone as a mateless hawk, there on the ledge, against the wall whose stones were pinchingly cold to the small of his back and his spread-eagled arms. He swayed slightly; realized with trembling nausea what would happen if he swayed too much.... He remembered that there was pavement below him. But he did not think about giving himself up.|$|E

5000|$|From lowest {{intervals}} to highest, the group's vocal harmony stack usually {{began with}} Love or Dennis, followed by Jardine or Carl, and finally Brian on top, according to Jardine, while <b>Carl</b> <b>said</b> that the blend was Love on bottom, Carl above, followed by Dennis or Jardine, and then Brian on top. Jardine explains, [...] "We always sang the same vocal intervals. ... As {{soon as we}} heard the chords on the piano we’d figure it out pretty easily. If there was a vocal move Brian envisioned, he’d show that particular singer that move. We had somewhat photographic memory {{as far as the}} vocal parts were concerned so that was never a problem for us." ...|$|E
