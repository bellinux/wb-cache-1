We provide reference intervals for 10 fetal urinary compounds and examine their variation with gestational age. Forty-one fetuses with bilateral obstructive uropathy (urine sampled between 20 and 38 weeks of gestational age) had normal, healthy values for serum creatmnine (50 gzmoVL) at ages 1 - 2 years. These cases were thus assumed {{to represent a}} reasonable approximation to healthy values. Sodium and i 2 -microglobulin concentrations significantly decreased with gestational age; <b>calcium,</b> <b>ammonia,</b> and creatinine significantly increased; glucose, phosphorus, chloride, urea, and total protein concentrations did not vary.

Results show that 73 % of the samples had turbidity values below the WHO, ICMR and United USPHS standards of 5 NTU. The electrical conductivity (µS/cm) of 5 % of the whole samples exceeded the WHO guideline value, 8 % of the entire samples had values higher than the WHO, ICMR and USPHS recommended concentration. In terms of iron, 25 % of all the samples had values in excess of WHO, ICMR and USPHS recommended value of 0. 3 mg/l. For manganese, 12 % of the entire samples had values more than the WHO and ICMR standards. On the other hand, more water samples (22 %) had manganese values above USPHS guideline value.

40|$|Compost for the {{production}} of Agaricus blazei Murrill mushrooms, is produced from wheat straw, straw-bedded horse manure, chicken manure and gypsum. The substrate is made in two processes called Phase I (anaerobic) and Phase II (aerobic). Phase I includes mixing and moistening of the ingredients and a period of uncontrolled self-heating where temperatures will rise to 80 ºC. Phase II starts with a pasteurization period of 8 h at 56 - 60 ºC and continues with a conditioning period at 45 ºC for up to 7 days until volatile NH 3 has been cleared from the process by air. Quality parameters for compost cannot be established directly. Moisture and nitrogen contents and pH can be adjusted at the start of Phase I, but the values will be affected during processing.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityAn {{extension}} of the thermochemical study {{of the nature of}} dilute solutions of <b>calcium</b> in liquid <b>ammonia</b> initiated in this laboratory was made in this study. Calorimetric measurement of the heat of solution of calcium iodide, which had been prepared a deammoniation of the calcium iodide ammoniate, yielded a value of + 63. 5 kcal. /mole at infinite dilution. A single measurement of the heat of precipitation of CaBr 2 • 8 NH 3 when combined with other thermochemical data gave a heat of solution of calcium bromide of + 64. 1 kcal. /mole. This is evidently in error since in numerous cases {{it has been shown that}} in liquid ammonia and water the heat of solution of the iodide is greater than the heat of solution of the bromide for a common metal. Using the heats of solution measured here and others from the literature heats of solvation were calculated for calcium metal, calcium bromide, calcium iodide, alkali metals (Li, Na, and K), alkali bromides, and alkali iodides. By combining these heats of solvation the heat effects for the following reactions involving calcium were evaluated; (A) 2 I-(g) - 2 e-(g) [...] > 2 I-(am) - 2 e-(am) ΔH - 63. 6 kcal. (B) 2 Br-(g) - 2 e-(g) [...] > 2 Br-(am) - 2 e-(am) ΔH - 80. 7 kcal. (C) 2 Br-(g) - 2 I-(g) [...] > 2 Br-(am) - 2 I-(am) ΔH - 17. 1 kcal. Comparison of the above heat effect with those for the the same reactions derived from the widely studied alkali metals and their halides showed good agreement for the comparison involving A, and poor agreement for the comparison with B or C. Further study of these comparisons indicated errors in heats of solution of calcium bromide and some of the alkali halides (LiI, LiBr, and KBr) which when taken into account improved the comparison with B. Since the above comparisons were made on the assumption that <b>calcium</b> in liquid <b>ammonia</b> (in the metal and halide solutions) was doubly charged the agreement found above was interpreted as evidence for the existence of calcium as Ca++ in dilute solutions of liquid ammonia...|$|R

The following main habitat types were covered: mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs, mud flats, river mouths and deep channels.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Ethylene glycol ethers {{and their}} acetates {{are widely used}} in industry, because of their {{hydrophilic}} and simultaneously lipophilic properties. Ethylene glycol ethers and their acetates are mainly metabolised to alkoxyacetic acids, {{but there is also}} a minor pathway through ethylene glycol to oxalic acid. The main pathway of ethylene glycol ethers is associated with significant clinical or experimental health effects and the minor pathway is also interesting because formation of urinary stones depends principally upon the urinary concentration of oxalate and calcium. METHODS: Excretion of alkoxyacetic and oxalic acids was examined among silkscreen printers for an entire working week. The aim of the study was to evaluate alkoxyacetic acids as early indicators of exposure to glycol ethers and to evaluate their toxicity to kidneys. The load of alkoxyacetic and oxalic acids was compared with the excretion of <b>calcium,</b> chloride, <b>ammonia,</b> and glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Morning urine was chosen for the main analysis, as the overall metabolite, ethoxyacetic acid (EAA), has a long elimination time from the body. RESULTS: The excretion of calcium increased according to the urinary alkoxyacetic acid load. The excretion of ammonia and chloride was higher among the exposed workers than among the controls. The highest urinary alkoxyacetic acid load was also associated with increased excretion of GAG, which may reflect the toxicity of metabolites of ethylene glycol ether. The excretion of GAG correlated positively with that of calcium in the printers with highest exposure. The tendency to form urinary stones was 2. 4 -fold higher among silkscreen printers than among office workers. CONCLUSION: On the basis of renal effects our study indicates the need for establishing a new biological exposure limit before a workshift that is clearly below 100 mmol ethoxyacetic acids per mol creatinine in morning urine of people occupationally exposed to ethylene glycol ethers...|$|R

Currently, the flue gas desulfurization technology used at thermal power plants {{at home and abroad}} tends to be higher rate of desulfurization, bigger installed capacity, more advanced technology, lower investment, less land acquisition, lower operation cost, higher level of automation, more excellent reliability, etc. This paper briefs current situations and trends of flue gas desulfurization technology also append short descript of different type of FDG and their category...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFertilization of {{sea urchin}} eggs {{triggers}} {{a rise of}} protein synthesis mainly dependent on the cap-binding protein eIF 4 E, which is released from its repressor 4 E-BP and associates with eIF 4 G. Association of eIF 4 G with eIF 4 E is a crucial event for {{the onset of the}} first mitotic division following fertilization. Artificial activation of unfertilized eggs with the calcium ionophore A 23187 results in the activation of protein synthesis comparable to the one triggered by fertilization, while increasing the intracellular pH by ammonia treatment results in partial activation of protein synthesis. Nevertheless, artificial activation does not induce the mitotic division. Here we investigate the effect of <b>calcium</b> ionophore and <b>ammonia</b> treatment of unfertilized eggs on eIF 4 E and its two antagonist partners, 4 E-BP and eIF 4 G. We show that the addition of calcium ionophore to unfertilized eggs induces permanent dissociation between eIF 4 E and 4 E-BP, whereas a reversible dissociation of the complex occurs after ammonia treatment. The regulation of the complex correlates with permanent or reversible 4 E-BP disappearance depending on the treatment used to trigger artificial activation. Furthermore, while calcium ionophore treatment of unfertilized eggs induces eIF 4 G modifications comparable to those observed following fertilization, ammonia treatment does not. These results suggest that ionophore and ammonia treatments of unfertilized eggs induce differential protein synthesis activation by targeting eIF 4 E availability and specific regulation through its two partners 4 E-BP and eIF 4 G...|$|R

Ions and nutrients measured were: <b>Ammonia,</b> <b>Calcium</b> (dissolved), Magnesium (dissolved), Potassium (dissolved), Sodium (dissolved), Bromide-ion, Carbon (organic dissolved), Chloride-ion, Nitrate, Nitrite, Phosphorus (soluble reactive), Phosphorus (total dissolved), Silicate (reactive dissolved), Sulphate, Carbon (organic particulate), Nitrogen (particulate), Phosphorus (total). Sites were sampled at regular weekly intervals and more intermittently during high flows (on average an extra sampling once a month per site). Samples were obtained using a wide neck PTFE bottle in a plastic covered bottle carrier (lowered from bridges where possible otherwise collected by immersing sample bottle by hand in the water as near the main flow as possible). Samples were filtered through Whatman 0. 45 um sterile membrane filters immediately on return to laboratory. Samples stored in sterilin tubes in the dark at 40 C and analysed by Dionex DX 100 ion chromatography system. Silicate reactive dissolved and Chloride-ion concentrations were determined by automated colourimetry and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were determined using a TOCsin II aqueous carbon analyser. Some samples on the River Aire were collected using EPIC automatic samplers.

ABSTRACT: In 1927, the limestone desulfurization process was first applied in the Barthes and Bansside Power Plants (total 120 MW) beside the Thames River in UK to protect high-rise building in London. Up to now, over 10 desulfurization processes have been launched and applied. Based on the desulfurizing agent being used, there include <b>calcium</b> process (limestone/lime), <b>ammonia</b> process, magnesium process, sodium process, alkali alumina process, copper oxide/zinc process, active carbon process, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate process, etc. The calcium process is commercially available and widely used in the world, i. e. more than 90 %. Flue gas desulfurization processes, survey made by the coal research institute under the International Energy Agency shows that the wet-process desulfurization accounts for 85 % of total installed capacity of flue gas desulfurization units across the world.

40|$|Over 97 % of the Earth’s {{water is}} high {{salinity}} {{water in the}} form of gulfs, oceans, and salt lakes. There is an increasing concern for the quality of water in bays, gulfs, oceans, and other natural waters. These waters are affected by many different sources of contamination. The sources are, but not limited to, groundwater run-off of nitrogen containing fertilizer, pesticides, cleaning agents, solid wastes, industrial waters, and many more. The final destinations of these contaminants are rivers, lakes, and bayous that eventually will lead to bays, gulfs, and oceans. Many industries depend on the quality of these waters, such as the fishing industry. In addition to wild marine life, there are large aquariums and fish and shrimp farms that are required to know the quality of the water. However, the ability of these industries to monitor their processes is limited. Most analytical methods do not apply to the analysis of high salinity waters. They are dependent on wet chemistry techniques, spectrophotometers, and flow analyzers. These methods do not have the accuracy, precision, and sensitivity when compared to ion chromatography (IC). Since the inception of IC, it has become a standard practice for determining the content of many different water samples. Many IC methods are limited in the range of analytes that can be detected, as well as the numerous sample sources of which the methods are applicable. The main focus of current IC methods does not include high salinity waters. This research demonstrates an ion chromatographic method that has the ability to determine low level concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and related anions (nitrite-N, nitrate-N, phosphorous-P, sulfate, bromide, chloride, sulfide, fluoride, <b>ammonia,</b> <b>calcium,</b> and magnesium) in a single run using a combination of UV and conductivity detectors. This method is applicable to various waters, and uses both freshwater and high salinity water samples...|$|R
40|$|Clotting of recalcified plasma Is {{followed}} {{by an increase in}} its ammonia content that lasts 4 to 6 h. This ammonia production closely parallels the Increase In acId-Insoluble flbrin, which is evidence that the ammonia results from the action of flbrinollgase. If the clot is removed, ammonia production stops. The Initial velocity of ammonia produc-tion is directly proportional to the fibrinogen concentration In plasma. Thus the rate-limiting factor In normal shed blood is the flbrinogen concentration. A maximum of 6. 4 ± 1. 5 (SD) molecules of ammonia are produced per mol-ecule of fibrinogen. Determination of the total ammonia produced is the fastest direct method of estimating the extent of fibrin cross-linkage in whole plasma. A method is proposedforassayIng fibrinoligase, based on the rate of ammonia production in the presence of casein as sub-strate. Normal values are 7. 6 ± 2. 9 (SD) tmoI/min per liter of plasma. When separated plasma is allowed to clot by adding <b>calcium</b> ions, its <b>ammonia</b> content can be observed to increase during several hours. This increase in ammonia has hitherto not been measured. Here, we present evidence indicating that the release of ammonia following clot formation is attributable to the action of fibrinoligase (no EC no. assigned) during the process of clot retraction. Clot retraction involves the formation of amide bonds between a 7 -carbonyl group of glutamine from one fibrin peptide chain and an c-amino group of lysine from another chain (1, 2). This cross-linking reaction, which is catalyzed by fi-brinoligase (activated clotting factor XIII), results in a firmer clot, which is insoluble in 5 mol/liter urea or dilute (10 g/liter) monochloroacetic acid (3, 4). The inactive factor XIII is converted to the active fibrino-ligase by thrombin. The presence of Ca 2 + is also re-quired to expose the active site of fibrinoligase (5) ...|$|R

The Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) developed a best management practice that leaves a riparian buffer next to streams to reduce the possibility of water quality degradation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to quantify water quality in upland forested watersheds before harvesting commences in order to provide a baseline for comparison with post-harvest water quality analyses. Water monitoring occurred on 15 sites in and around Current River and Angeline Conservation Areas in Missouri, USA. Water samples were collected from in-stream water samplers located in the ephemeral drainage way and hillslope samplers located on slopes adjoining the ephemeral drainage way. The water samples were tested for total phosphorous, soluble reactive phosphorous, total nitrogen, nitrate, <b>ammonia,</b> <b>calcium,</b> magnesium, potassium, total suspended solids, total volatile suspended solids, pH, and electrical conductivity. The time period of sample collection began in October 2004 and lasted to January 2006. This time period yielded nearly 384 samples. The baseline levels for all constituents have been quantitatively determined by utilizing the "three sigma method" which incorporates data from 99. 87 % of all values recorded for the species of interest. The following baseline values were established: pH was 8. 3, electrical conductivity was 200 us/cm, TSS was 0. 5 g/L and TVSS was 0. 2 g/L, Ca was 13 mg/L and Mg was 10 mg/L, K was 10 mg/L, TP was 1. 3 mg/L and SRP was 1. 1 mg/L, total nitrogen was 5. 8 mg/L and nitrate and ammonia concentrations were 1. 3 and 1. 6 mg/L respectively. All parameter concentrations were found to have strong seasonal trends, and varied greatly from site to site...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. (Biotechnology) Abstract: Due to {{industrialization}} and development, {{the environment is}} under severe stress {{as a result of}} pollution. Water bodies are being compromised due to inadequate remediation technologies available. Conventional technologies are known to cause secondary pollution upon usage, which is of serious concern as they do not eliminate the predicament. Non-conventional methods are being considered because they are environmentally friendly and cost efficient. Dyes are one of the primary pollutants of water resources being very toxic and when discharged into the environment, they pose a threat to human and animal health due to their tetragenic, mutagenic and carcinogenic potentials. This study explores the use of microorganisms in bioremediation of dyes. In doing so, four bacteria viz: Gram-negative (i. e., E. coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (i. e.,Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillaceae bacterium) were used. The bacteria were subjected to physical pre-treatment using an autoclave, mechanical pretreatment by grinding the inactive biomass and lastly, chemical pre-treatment using chemicals such as nitric acid, propyl amine, <b>calcium</b> chloride and <b>ammonia.</b> The pre-treatment techniques were applied to investigate their effect on the adsorption of dye. The Lagergren pseudo second-order kinetic was used to deduce the adsorption capacities as it was the best fit, implying that adsorption occurred by the chermisoption mechanism. The adsorption capacities of the bacteria improved tremendously from 68. 49 to 161. 29 mg/g in comparison to that of the untreated biomass (9. 37 to 29. 11 mg/g). It was also observed that in untreated biomass, no methyl orange (MO) adsorption took place whereas in treated biomass, bacteria had the ability to absorb and remove MO. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra of the bacterial cell walls revealed the presence of functional groups (amines, carboxylic acids, alcohols, aldehyde and amides). Meanwhile, data obtained on the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) showed a homogenous surface and finer particles, which demonstrate an increase in the surface area of the treated bacterial cells. The Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria exhibited the ability to remove cationic and [...] ...|$|R
