5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the scientific literature by Carl Linnaeus under the name Hydnum auriscalpium in his 1753 Species Plantarum. Linnaeus placed three other tooth fungi in the genus Hydnum: H.imbricatum, H.repandum, and H.tomentosum. In 1821, Samuel Frederick Gray considered H.auriscalpium to be sufficiently distinct from the other Hydnum species to warrant {{the creation of a}} new genus, Auriscalpium, to <b>contain</b> <b>it.</b> In the process, its name was changed to Auriscalpium vulgare.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described in 1805 as Lycoperdon corium {{in the second}} volume of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Flore Française. They attributed authorship to French botanist Louis Ben Guersent, who discovered it in an alfalfa field between the town of La Sotte and Rouen in northern France. Synonyms include Scleroderma corium published by Arthur Harmount Graves in 1830, and Steerbekia corium published by Elias Magnus Fries in 1849. The species was given its current name by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux in 1842, who circumscribed the genus Mycenastrum to <b>contain</b> <b>it.</b> Generic synonyms are Vassiliĭ Matveievitch Czernajew's 1845 Endonevrum and Stephan Schulzer von Müggenburg's 1876 Pachyderma.|$|E

5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare, {{commonly}} known as the pinecone mushroom, the cone tooth, or the ear-pick fungus, is a species of fungus in the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales. It was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, who included it {{as a member of the}} tooth fungi genus Hydnum, but British mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray recognized its uniqueness and in 1821 transferred it to the genus Auriscalpium that he created to <b>contain</b> <b>it.</b> The fungus is widely distributed in Europe, Central America, North America, and temperate Asia. Although common, its small size and nondescript colors lead it to be easily overlooked in the pine woods where it grows. A.vulgare is not generally considered edible because of its tough texture, but some historical literature says it used to be consumed in France and Italy.|$|E
5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising to roll back communism, rather than <b>contain</b> <b>it.</b> Working {{in an atmosphere of}} increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E

In one account of the events, Elegabalus was saluted as Antoninus by the soldiers, after his father Caracalla whose official name was Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.

After Coco's laptop battery dies, she forces a sleeping Crash to get her a new one. While doing so, Crash is abducted by a bright light and finds himself in an old Warp Room hidden in Cortex's castle, where a holographic projection of Cortex instructs him to bring him the crystals by traveling through the Warp Room's doors. After Crash collects a crystal, Cortex informs Crash of the upcoming destructive force and assigns him the task of bringing all of the crystals to him so that he may <b>contain</b> <b>it.</b> After retrieving a gem, Crash is greeted by a hologram from Doctor Nitrus Brio, Cortex's former assistant from the previous game, who is now out to stop Cortex's plans for world domination. Brio explains that the Earth contains gems in addition to crystals, and that collecting 42 gems will allow Brio to fire a laser beam that can destroy the Cortex Vortex.|$|E
5|$|With {{the third}} edition of Erasmus's Greek text (1522) the Comma Johanneum was included.

When a single 16th-century Greek manuscript subsequently had been found to <b>contain</b> <b>it</b> (Codex Montfortianus), Erasmus included it, though he expressed doubt as to {{the authenticity of the}} passage in his Annotations. Henk Jan de Jonge, a specialist in Erasmian studies, stated that there is no explicit evidence that supports this frequently made assertion concerning a specific promise made by Erasmus. The real reason to include the Comma by Erasmus, was his care for his good name and for the success of his Novum Testamentum.|$|E

5|$|On 29 June, Hitler, {{through the}} Commander-in-Chief of the German Army Walther von Brauchitsch, {{instructed}} {{the commander of}} Army Group Center Fedor von Bock to halt the advance of his panzers until the infantry formations liquidating the pockets catch up. But {{the commander of the}} 2nd Panzer Group Heinz Guderian, with the tacit support of Fedor von Bock and the chief of OKH Franz Halder, ignored the instruction and attacked on eastward towards Bobruisk, albeit reporting the advance as a reconnaissance-in-force. He also personally conducted an aerial inspection of the Minsk-Białystok pocket on 30 June and concluded that his panzer group was not needed to <b>contain</b> <b>it,</b> since Hermann Hoth's 3rd Panzer Group was already involved in the Minsk pocket. On the same day, some of the infantry corps of the 9th and 4th Armies, having sufficiently liquidated the Białystok pocket, resumed their march eastward {{to catch up with the}} panzer groups. On 1 July, Fedor von Bock ordered the panzer groups to resume their full offensive eastward on the morning of 3 July. But Brauchitsch, upholding Hitler's instruction, and Halder, unwillingly going along with it, opposed Bock's order. However, Bock insisted on the order by stating that it would be irresponsible to reverse orders already issued. The panzer groups, however, resumed their offensive on 2 July before the infantry formations had sufficiently caught up.|$|E
