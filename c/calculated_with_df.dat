To investigate the incidence, treatment, and prognosis of acute acalculous cholecystitis in DF patients, we retrospectively studied 10 patients <b>with</b> <b>DF</b> and acute acalculous cholecystitis. From October 2001 to July 2002, 131 patients were diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>DF.</b> Ten of 131 DF patients (7. 63 %) had complications of acute acalculous cholecystitis. Two patients underwent cholecystectomy and one underwent percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage due to poor resolution of acute acalculous cholecystitis. We found acute acalculous cholecystitis {{in a small}} proportion of patients <b>with</b> <b>DF.</b> In our experience, closely monitoring vital signs to avoid shock and correct thrombocytopenia to avoid bleeding could be adequate for most patients.

40|$|Background: Dengue {{cases have}} been {{classified}} according to disease severity into dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Although DF is considered a non-severe manifestation of dengue, it has been recently demonstrated that DF represents a heterogeneous group of patients with varied clinical complications and grades of severity. Particularly, bleeding complications, commonly associated to DHF, can be detected in half of the patients <b>with</b> <b>DF.</b> Although a frequent complication, the causes of bleedings in DF have not been fully addressed. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to perform a comprehensive evaluation of possible pathophysiological mechanisms that could contribute to the bleeding tendency observed in patients <b>with</b> <b>DF.</b> Methods: This is a case-control study that enrolled adults <b>with</b> <b>DF</b> without bleeding and adults <b>with</b> <b>DF</b> and bleeding complications during the defervescence period. Healthy controls were also included. Peripheral blood counts, inflammatory, fibrinolysis and endothelial cell activation markers, and thrombin generation were evaluated in patients and controls. Results: We included 33 adults <b>with</b> <b>DF</b> without complications, 26 adults <b>with</b> <b>DF</b> and bleeding and 67 healthy controls. Bleeding episodes were mild in 15 (57. 6 %) and moderate in 11 (42. 4 %) patients, 8 (30. 7 %) patients had bleedings in multiple sites. Patients <b>with</b> <b>DF</b> and bleedings had lower platelet counts than DF without bleeding (median = 19, 500 vs. 203, 500 /mm 3, P < 0, 0001). Levels of TNF-alpha, thrombomodulin and VWF were significantly increased in the two dengue groups than in healthy controls, but similar between patients with and without bleedings. Plasma levels of tPA and D-dimer were significantly increased in patients with bleedings (median tPA levels were 4. 5, 5. 2, 11. 7 ng/ml, P < 0. 0001 and median D-dimer levels were 515. 5, 1028 and 1927 ng/ml, P < 0. 0001). The thrombin generation test showed that patients with bleeding complications had reduced thrombin formation (total thrombin generated were 3753. 4 in controls, 3367. 5 in non-bleeding and 2274. 5 nM in bleeding patients, P < 0. 002). Conclusions: <b>DF</b> can manifest <b>with</b> spontaneous bleedings, which are associated with specific coagulation and fibrinolysis profiles that are not significantly present in DF without this complication. Particularly, thrombocytopenia, excessive fibrinolysis and reduced thrombin formation may contribute to the bleeding manifestations in DF...|$|R

40|$|The aim of our {{case-control study}} was to compare {{selected}} psychological and social characteristics between diabetic patients with and without the DF (controls). Methods. 104 patients with and 48 without DF were included into our study. Both study groups were compared in terms of selected psychosocial characteristics. Results. Compared to controls, patients <b>with</b> <b>DF</b> had a significantly worse {{quality of life in}} the area of health and standard of living as shown by lower physical health domain (12. 7 ± 2. 8 versus 14. 7 ± 2. 5; P< 0. 001) and environment domain (14. 1 ± 2. 2 versus 15 ± 1. 8; P< 0. 01) that negatively correlated with diabetes duration (r=- 0. 061; P= 0. 003). Patients <b>with</b> <b>DF</b> subjectively felt more depressed in contrast to controls (24. 5 versus 7. 3 %; P< 0. 05); however, the depressive tuning was objectively proven in higher percentage in both study groups (83. 2 versus 89. 6; NS). We observed a significantly lower level of achieved education (P< 0. 01), more patients with disability pensions (P< 0. 01), and low self-support (P< 0. 001) in patients <b>with</b> the <b>DF</b> compared to controls. In the subgroup of patients with a previous major amputation and DF (n= 6), there were significantly worse outcomes as in the environment domain (P< 0. 01), employment status, and stress readaptation (P< 0. 01) in contrast to the main study groups.

40|$|Introduction The {{number of}} cancer {{survivors}} experiencing disease progression (DP) is increasing {{with the number}} of cancer survivors. However, little is known whether DP affects health-related quality of life (HRQL) of long-term cancer survivors. We aimed therefore to compare the health status (HS) and HRQL of DP and disease-free (DF) survivors up to 15 years after initial diagnosis. Methods 232 cancer survivors with DP identified through the Eindhoven Cancer Registry were matched <b>with</b> 232 <b>DF</b> survivors of similar demographic and clinical characteristics. Patients completed generic HS (SF- 36) and cancer-specific HRQL (QOL-CS) questionnaires 5 - 15 years after diagnosis. Results Compared <b>with</b> <b>DF</b> survivors, DP survivors exhibited significantly lower scores on all SF- 36 and QOL-CS (except spiritual well-being) dimensions. DF survivors had better scores than the normative population on all SF- 36 dimensions. Among survivors with DP, those with short survival (< 5 years) had significantly poorer HS scores on all dimensions except bodily pain compared with the normative population. Comparatively, the long survival (≥ 5 years) DP group had better HRQL than the short DP group but poorer HRQL than the normative population. In multivariate analyses, DP and DF survival time were independently associated with aspects of HS and HRQL in cancer survivors. Discussions/Conclusions DP cancer survivors have poorer long-term HS and HRQL compared <b>with</b> <b>DF</b> survivors. However, there is suggestion that HS and HRQL does improve over time following DP. Implication for Cancer Survivors Although DP survivors report poorer long-term HRQL compared <b>with</b> <b>DF</b> cancer survivors, results suggest that time can attenuate the distress of DP on HRQL. Psycho-educational programs could help to increase patients' sense of empowerment and personal control should DP occur...|$|R

The proposed method obtains the space diversity {{by using the}} multi-relay cooperative communications. Moreover, since the proposed method uses the error correcting code and interleaving, obtains also the coding gain. However, if the channel condition of relays is bad, the system performance is degraded. Therefore, the proposed method splits the packet to obtain the space and coding gains. Moreover, the proposed method uses the selection parameters α and γ to obtain the maximum gains. As a result, the proposed method obtains the maximum coding gain due to the space diversity. From the simulation results, the proposed method has decided the optimum value of selection parameters α and γ, and achieved the best BER performance.

Galectin- 9 (Gal- 9), a β-galactoside-binding protein with various biologic effects, acts as an immunomodulator in excessive immunologic reactions by expanding regulatory T cells (Treg) and enhancing transforming growth factor (TGF) -β signaling. We investigated the efficacy of sublingually administered Gal- 9 as an adjuvant to a specific allergen in a Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) -induced mouse model of chronic asthma. Methods: BALB/c mice were intranasally sensitized <b>with</b> <b>Df</b> extract 5 days/week for 5 weeks, and then sublingual Df-allergen extract for 2 weeks (5 days/week). Three days after the final sublingual treatment, mice were intranasally challenged <b>with</b> <b>Df</b> extract. The early asthmatic response (EAR) was evaluated 5  min after the last Df challenge. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was assayed and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed 24  h after the last allergen challenge. Serum IgE and cytokine levels, and number of inflammatory cells in the BAL fluid (BALF) were analyzed. Results: Sublingual Df treatment {{in the presence of}} Gal- 9, but not alone, significantly reduced AHR; EAR; number of eosinophils and interleukin- 13 in the BALF; and serum IgE levels. BALF TGF-β 1 levels were significantly increased in the presence of Gal- 9 compared <b>with</b> <b>Df</b> alone. Treg depletion blocked the inhibitory effects of Gal- 9 on the EAR, AHR, eosinophilic airway inflammation, and Df-specific serum IgE levels, and suppressed BALF TGF-β 1 levels.
