40|$|Synthetic musk {{compounds}} are artificial {{organic compounds}} with a smell {{similar to the}} odor of a natural musk. The most recently discovered and also the least known group of artificial musks is linear musk compounds. These substances are now often used in cosmetics, personal care products, detergents and various cleaning products. They have leaked into all the major environment components, especially into the hydrosphere. There has been great attention drawn to synthetic musk compounds {{in the last few}} years because of their environmental impact. The aim of this thesis is to identify twelve linear musk compounds (linalool, 2 -cyclohexylethanol, fresco menthe, citronellol, HSA, isobornyl acetate, arocet, aroflorone, allyl <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>propionate,</b> lilial, isoamyl salicylate and hexylcinnamic aldehyde) in waste water samples. The samples were taken at three different waste water treatment plants (WWTP) in South Moravian region (WWTP Brno-Modřice, WWTP Luhačovice and WWTP Hodonín). Each of these treatment plants has a different equivalent number of inhabitants. At first, a working method was optimized, then applied on real waste water samples. Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique was used for the extraction of analytes. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was then used for identification and quantificaton of the studied compounds...|$|E

These compounds are devoid of affinity for CB(1) and CB(2) receptors and characterized by high percentages of inhibition of N-palmitoylethanolamine-selective acid amidase (84. 0, 70. 5, and 76. 7 % inhibition at 100 microM, respectively) with much lower inhibitory effect on either {{fatty acid amide}} hydrolase or the uptake of anandamide...|$|R
