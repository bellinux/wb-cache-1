40|$|International audienceWith {{the desire}} bring more comfort and safety to {{disabled}} drivers, new technologies have been deemed {{appropriate for the}} development of innovative driving assistance. This paper describes the possibility of integrating these technologies {{for the development of}} a positive interacting system with disabled drivers. In this context, we suggest a new solution for a braking device that aims at helping paraplegic drivers: Integrated in a steer-by-wire handwheel, the driver has only to press on the handwheel to brake the vehicle. The device is equipped with automatic releasing of the handwheel movement when braking is no longer required. The proposed solution brings many advantages in terms of safety and ergonomics. Indeed, this device will enable the driver to brake and to accelerate while continuously keeping the hands on the handwheel. This gives the driver a significant gain in braking time. The use of an active braking feedback also provides a progressive and intuitive proportioning brake. This concept opens prospects to active braking assistance. To <b>concretize</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> theoretical and simulation studies are carried out for the main processes of the device. A prototype has also been developed...|$|E

40|$|Most data {{analytics}} systems that require low-latency execution and efficient utilization of computing resources, increasingly adopt two computational paradigms, namely, incremental and approximate computing. Incremental computation updates the output incrementally instead of re-computing everything from scratch for successive runs {{of a job}} with input changes. Approximate computation returns an approximate output for a job instead of the exact output. Both paradigms rely on computing over a subset of data items instead of computing over the entire dataset, but they differ in their means for skipping parts of the computation. Incremental computing relies on the memoization of intermediate results of sub-computations, and reusing these memoized results across jobs for sub-computations that are unaffected by the changed input. Approximate computing relies on representative sampling of the entire dataset to compute over a subset of data items. In this thesis, we make the observation that these two computing paradigms are complementary, and can be married together! The high level idea is to: design a sampling algorithm that biases the sample selection to the memoized data items from previous runs. To <b>concretize</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> we designed an online stratified sampling algorithm that uses self-adjusting computation to produce an incrementally updated approximate output with bounded error. We implemented our algorithm in a {{data analytics}} system called IncAppox based on Apache Spark Streaming.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} approaches Iris Marion Young 2 ̆ 7 s {{politics of}} difference {{as an essential}} condition for deliberative democracy. It identifies and examines Young 2 ̆ 7 s arguments in four areas foundational {{to the politics of}} difference namely, inclusion, political equality, reasonableness and publicity. It contends that some of the arguments sustaining these foundations are shaky. Therefore, the dissertation attempts to improve the weak aspects of Young 2 ̆ 7 s arguments in order to solidify the basis for the politics of difference and, in so doing, facilitate the development of deliberative democracy. To that end, the dissertation argues against Young 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of impartiality and proposes combining Thomas Nagel 2 ̆ 7 s approach to impartiality with Benhabib 2 ̆ 7 s argument for the need for a standard of judgement. As it stands, Young 2 ̆ 7 s argument against impartiality makes it difficult, if not impossible, to create an inclusive political community. In the discussion of political equality Young dismisses essentialist difference and replaces it with relational differentiation. Thus she keeps cultural relationships fluid so as to facilitate an argument for culturally-based rights to equal citizenship. Building on Young 2 ̆ 7 s approach, this dissertation combines Charles Beitz 2 ̆ 7 s approach to political equality with Jack Knight 2 ̆ 7 s and James Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s argument for politically relevant capacities to furnish an adequate response to the charge that the politics of difference makes an unwarranted leap between the equality of people as individuals and that of people as members of cultural groups. Further, the dissertation argues that the concept of reasonableness, as used by Young, is too vague {{for the purposes of the}} politics of difference. Reasonableness is a disposition. Instead, the politics of difference should <b>concretize</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> by discussing reasonable people. Reasonable people understand that legitimate moral and political decisions do not necessarily reflect all reasons advanced in a deliberation. Finally, by adopting James Bohman 2 ̆ 7 s distinction between deliberation and dialogue demonstrates, the dissertation demonstrates why and how it is possible for the politics of difference to maintain unity and pluralism simultaneously. Young does not address this seeming contradiction...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{sustainable}} {{and sustaining}} planning strategy is globally important for metropolitan areas. Sustainable planning addresses {{the development of}} strategies to reduce the use of resources, increase economic efficiency and improve integration of social aspects (e. g. pedestrian friendly environments, well balanced public and private transport modes, efficient street networks; land use, movement economy; access for all to jobs, retail, services, healthcare, culture, and leisure). In order to reduce urban sprawl, numerous authors recommend {{going back to the}} concept of compact cities. However, policies favoring the compact city concept turned out to be less efficient than expected. Indeed, a large number of households choosing these areas reject urban density since they prefer living in individual houses surrounded by a garden and enjoy a green and calm environment. Hence, instead of rejecting urban sprawl it seems more reasonable to find solutions for better managing the dynamic aspects of cities, in order to reduce traffic costs and pollution, and to avoid undermining natural and agricultural resources. Frankhauser (2004) first proposed reflections onto what extent planning concepts referring to fractal geometry could be of interest for reducing negative impacts of urban sprawl. In a recent research project, financed by the French Ministry of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Sea in the framework of the PREDIT research program, a planning concept was developed <b>concretizing</b> <b>this</b> basic <b>idea.</b> A planning support system was developed which allows testing the efficiency of the concept (Frankhauser et al 2007, 2008). Let us recall that fractal geometry is based on a hierarchical principle, which has been to be an essential element of urban structures. The hierarchical ordering principle is a cascade of similar elements on different levels of detail: house, block, quarter, district - or: path, residential road, side street, main road, freeway, and highway. According to Read (Read 2000), different scales of hierarchy are distinguished by scales of mobility, and are designed to convey different scales of movement. The spatio-functional pattern describes everyday space use and movement. The above-mentioned fundamental systematic of the built environment requires a structural-analytical approach on all interwoven scales (global to local) for future developments (regional, urban and architectural). The multi-scale logic allows the articulation of residential areas and leisure areas across scales, introducing different levels of service centres according to their frequency of use. These service centres are localized in the nodes of the transportation system thus improving their accessibility with respect to residential areas. This paper addresses a further development of this theoretical model, extending it to be a holistic, comprehensive system. The idea of an "urban" hierarchy (street network, green areas, building blocks, building heights, and urban centres), generated as a multi-scale urban planning model for developing scenarios (regional, urban, architectural scale - 2 D & 3 D) for metropolitan areas, allows the implementation of highly efficient, functional and sustainable transport networks, masterplans and mass models. The comprehensive system presented here can not only simulate growth scenarios but also assesses the quality of an existing area for consolidation and revitalisation (masterplan, urban fringe) or to identify areas with low overall access for a sustainable negative growth scenario (inverse model for shrinking cities and quarters) ...|$|R

In {{concrete}} environments, where {{uncertainty and}} dynamism are pervasive {{and time and}} resources are limited, reasoning and decision-making processes raise important problems related both to adaptive ability and to the computational complexity of the underlying cognitive mechanisms.

30|$|Our study <b>concretizes</b> <b>this</b> {{phenomenon}} {{by adding}} that networks {{are not necessarily}} “leaderless” or a “leadership-free zone”. Rather, leadership is vitally needed; however, it emerged only in the collective form. Our fieldwork showed that, given embeddedness in a peer-like networked context, participants developed context-sensitive alternative (i.e. non-individualistic and more relational) conceptions of being influential, which—under certain circumstances (as described in our model)—led to collective efforts by the network as a whole (i.e. network drive and shared leadership development). These aspects of our findings echo the relevance of plural leadership forms, such as collective or shared leadership, in collaborative interorganizational networks (Denis et al. 2001; Huxham and Vangen 2000; Ospina and Saz-Carranza 2010; Weibler and Rohn-Endres 2010; White et al. 2016).|$|R

Furthermore, results for the second and third treatments strongly indicate that human players value prior experiential trust over quantitative information regarding potential teammates. At least for the context of games with small monetary rewards, trust established in an earlier context clearly influences behavior even when the two contexts differ, and non-trust-related quantitative information only seems important when differences in this trust are small.|$|R
