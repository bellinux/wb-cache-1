5|$|In November 2015 the Lynton & Barnstaple {{signed a}} {{twinning}} {{agreement with the}} Walhalla Goldfields Railway in Victoria, Australia. This agreement <b>came</b> <b>about</b> due to the similar nature of the railways and to foster cooperation and volunteer exchanges. Like the L, the Moe-Walhalla railway was closed over 70 years ago {{and the work of}} restoration requires rebuilding the track bed and railway infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of the dynasty, semi-autonomous regional kings rivaled the emperor's authority. This autonomy was greatly diminished when the imperial court enacted reforms following the threats to central control like the Rebellion of the Seven States.

5|$|One of {{the more}} bizarre {{software}} products for the ZX81 <b>came</b> <b>about</b> {{as a result of}} music companies attempting to capitalise on the popularity of Sinclair's computers. In 1983, EMI released a single by Chris Sievey that had a ZX81 program recorded on the B-side. Island Records responded with XL1 by Buzzcocks frontman Pete Shelley, packaged with a program for the ZX Spectrum.|$|E

Stars were proven to be similar to the Earth's own Sun, but {{with a wide range of}} temperatures, masses, and sizes.|$|E
5|$|Since 2012 Chad {{has been}} divided into 23 regions. The {{subdivision}} of Chad in regions <b>came</b> <b>about</b> in 2003 {{as part of}} the decentralisation process, when the government abolished the previous 14 prefectures. Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. Prefects administer the 61 departments within the regions. The departments are divided into 200 sub-prefectures, which are in turn composed of 446 cantons.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Agrippa in 12BC, a {{solution}} had {{to be found in}} maintaining Rome's water supply system. This <b>came</b> <b>about</b> because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.|$|E

5|$|Albert and Victoria {{were shot}} at again on both 29 and 30 May 1842, but were unhurt. The culprit, John Francis, was {{detained}} and condemned to death, {{although he was}} later reprieved. Some of their early unpopularity <b>came</b> <b>about</b> because of their stiffness and adherence to protocol in public, though in private the couple were more easy-going. In early 1844, Victoria and Albert were apart {{for the first time}} since their marriage when he returned to Coburg on the death of his father.|$|E
5|$|Braose {{was the son}} of William de Braose, 1st Baron Braose and {{his first}} wife, Aline, {{daughter}} of Thomas de Multon. He was likely born around 1260, as his age was given as about 46 in 1307. Other events prove that he was born prior to 1264, as he was captured in that year. This <b>came</b> <b>about</b> during the Second Barons' War (1264–1267) during the reign of King Henry III of England, as the elder Braose had sided with the king during Simon de Montfort's rebellion. The younger Braose was a hostage in the custody of Montfort's wife, Eleanor. Her household accounts include expenses related to the younger William's care.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, players uncover clues about the D'ni, an ancient civilization, and the archeological group {{dedicated}} to learning more about them, the D'ni Restoration Council.

Players may collect Relto pages, which offer cosmetic customization to the player's personal Age—for example, making it rain or adding a waterfall.|$|E

5|$|Following Japan's {{entry into}} the Second World War in December 1941, the {{battalion}} was called up for defensive duties. Attached to the 2nd Brigade, the battalion provided garrison troops to vital installations around Melbourne until August 1942 when it was transferred to Western Australia, being attached to the 6th Brigade, which was based around Geraldton. In September 1942, {{as part of an}} Army-wide reduction that <b>came</b> <b>about</b> because of over-mobilisation, the battalion was amalgamated with the 14th Battalion to become the 14th/32nd Battalion (Prahran/Footscray Regiment).|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b was {{difficult}} to confirm because its star experiences high jitter, which disrupted the ability to obtain accurate measurements. As such, {{a greater number of}} radial velocity observations were collected to make the confirmation, although it was later determined that HAT-P-33b could not be determined using the radial velocity method. The planet's confirmation <b>came</b> <b>about</b> after the planet's light curve was collected, and the Blendanal process ruled out most false positive scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the East End {{is arguably}} conterminous with the Manor of Stepney. This manor {{was held by}} the Bishop of London, in {{compensation}} for his duties in maintaining and garrisoning the Tower of London. Further ecclesiastic holdings <b>came</b> <b>about</b> from the need to enclose the marshes and create flood defences along the Thames. Edward VI passed the land to the Wentworth family, and thence to their descendants, the Earls of Cleveland. The ecclesiastic system of copyhold, whereby land was leased to tenants for terms as short as seven years, prevailed throughout the manor. This severely limited scope for improvement {{of the land and}} new building until the estate was broken up in the 19th century.|$|E
