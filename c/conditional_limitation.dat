5000|$|Generally, {{additional}} insured clauses are worded {{in broad}} terms, such as [...] "any person or organization whom you (the named insured) {{are required to}} add as an additional insured on this policy under a written contract ... that person is only an additional insured with respect to liability arising out of 'your work' for that additional insured." [...] (CG 70 48 04 02) The clauses often include <b>conditional</b> <b>limitations,</b> such as limiting coverage to claims arising during the [...] "ongoing operations" [...] of the named insured, unless contracts require otherwise. And, they often contain assertions {{that they will be}} excess to other insurance policies (the [...] "Other" [...] Insurance problem). These can conflict with opposite provisions in other policies, leading to mutual repugnance of the Other Insurance clauses. Thus disputes often arise based on the relative responsibility of an insured in causing an incident, and the relative liabilities of their respective insurers. These disputes are further {{complicated by the fact that}} some of the original contracting parties may have contractually agreed to indemnify other parties. These indemnifications, in turn, can be liabilities to be covered by the policies pursuant to [...] "insured contract" [...] coverage. Courts in different states decide these disputes differently, depending on the unique facts of each case and the law of that particular state. Following the general rule that insurance policies are broadly interpreted in favor of coverage, such disputes are often resolved in favor of maximizing coverage for every insured.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. This {{theoretical}} study {{reviews the}} theoretical and applied foundations of a functional analysis strategy in clinical case-formulation. Functional relations between variables {{are those that}} demonstrate a mathematical association. Causal functional relations between variables require: (a) covariance, (b) a logical connection, (c) temporal precedence of the causal variable, and (d) absence of a third variable explaining the relation. There are unidirectional, bidirectional, moderating, and mediating (i. e., explanatory) causal functional relations. In a functional analysis the relevant, controllable, and causal functional relations that apply to particular behaviors of an individual are identified. A functionalanalytic approach to case-formulation is designed to minimize clinical judgment bias and optimize clinical decision-making in the assessment and treatment processes. Additional features of a functional analysis and its use for intervention design are discussed {{within the context of}} a patient diagnosed with Schizophrenia Paranoid Type.

40|$|Studies in {{the area}} of {{shipping}} freight risk measurement and management are limited and the understandings of the impact of freight volatility dynamics on the freight market remain insufficient and under-researched. The few studies that explore different approaches to measuring freight risk disagree on the most suitable measures and this is down to different interpretation of the underlying conditional variance for freight rates. Thus, the intention {{of this study is to}} contribute to the literature in the field of shipping freight risk studies. In this thesis tanker freight risk is measured using univariate and multivariate value-at-risk measures that are structured on a variety of single- and multi-state conditional variance models. Moreover, uncorrelated freight risk factors and conditional freight-beta are estimated through an orthogonal conditional variance and a dynamic freight-beta approach for a portfolio of freight returns, respectively. This thesis also investigates the hypothesis of the state dependency of freight dynamics through a <b>conditional</b> freight <b>limitation</b> framework, which distinguishes between âship-ownerâ and âcargo-ownerâ markets, in particular pre- and during the most recent financial crisis. Furthermore, the short and long term effect of the financial crisis on freight markets are examined through a multi-state Markov switching-regime framework that provides thresholds indicating different freight bands for distinct market conditions. Thus, the hypothesis of variation in the freight-return relation is investigated on the basis that up and down market movements are defined as shipping agent controlled. Additionally, specific and systematic risks for the tanker market are extracted and compared across distinct tanker segments. Finally, a practical insight into shipping practitionersâ measurement and management of freight risk for different shipping segments is examined, where the directional accuracy and volatility of short- and long-term forward curves are assessed and compared against a general perception in the literature.

40|$|Transgenic {{technologies}} in mice became invaluable experimental tools {{to identify the}} in vivo function of proteins. However, conventional knockout technology often results in embryonic lethality and because genes are frequently expressed in multiple cell types, the resulting knockout phenotypes can be complex and difficult or impossible to dissect. These issues are particularly important for gene-targeting strategies used to examine renal function. The kidney contains {{quite a number of}} different cell types, the function of many of which impacts that of other renal cells. To avoid these <b>limitations</b> <b>conditional</b> knockout strategies have been designed. As one important part of this system we describe the development of a mouse line expressing the tamoxifen-activatable Cre recombinase Cre-ER(T 2) specifically in renal proximal tubules. The expression of Cre-ER(T 2) is driven by a promoter fragment of the mouse gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase type II gene resulting in the generation of the activatable recombinase in S 3 segments of the proximal tubules from which over 80 % were positive for Cre activity. In combination with loxP-based conditional mutant mice as a second tool this tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER(T 2) line allows functional analysis of a variety of genes important for renal development and function in a precisely controlled spatiotemporal manner...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that additional genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, other than the class II genes HLADQB 1 - and - DRB 1 (the IDDM 1 locus), may contribute to susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. The relative magnitude of these non-DR/DQ effects is uncertain and their map location is unknown owing to the extraordinary linkage disequilibrium that extends over the 3. 5 Mb of the MHC. The homozygous parent test has been proposed as a method for detection of additional risk factors conditional on HLA-DQB 1 and - DRB 1. However, this method is inefficient since it uses only parents homozygous for the primary disease locus, the DQB 1 -DRB 1 haplotype. To overcome this <b>limitation,</b> <b>Conditional</b> ETDT was used in the present report to test for association conditional on the DQB 1 -DRB 1 haplotype, thereby allowing all parents {{to be included in the}} analysis. First, we confirm in UK and Sardinian type 1 diabetic families that allelic variation at HLA-DRB 1 has a very significant effect on the association of DQB 1 and vice versa. The Conditional ETDT was then applied to the HLA TNF (tumour necrosis factor) region and microsatellite marker D 6 S 273 region, both of which have been reported to contribute to IDDM 1 independent of the HLA-DQB 1 -DRB 1 genes.

40|$|In this thesis, {{parameter}} estimation for multivariate heteroscedastic models with unspecified correlations is considered. Two alternative approaches for estimating the state variables and unknown parameters in non-linear and non-Gaussian state space models with unspecified correlations are developed; {{these are the}} quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood methods. Quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood approaches {{have been found to}} be useful in {{parameter estimation}}, especially when the underlying system dynamic probability distribution cannot be fully specified. The quasi-likelihood method relaxes the distributional assumptions and only assumes knowledge of the first two <b>conditional</b> moments. A <b>limitation</b> of quasi-likelihood is that the nature of the conditional covariance matrix is not always known. An alternative approach, asymptotic quasi-likelihood is described. Semiparametric treatment is considered in this thesis. It involves a nonparametric kernel approach to estimating the unknown covariance matrix and it integrates the estimation of the covariance matrix with the standard quasi-likelihood approach. Applications of the quasi likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood approaches to state space models are demonstrated via simulation studies. One simulation study based on the Poisson model and another based on the basic stochastic volatility model are presented. Results from these simulation studies show that the performance of the quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood approaches are comparable to other methods, with no knowledge required of the underlying systemâs probability structure. Sensitivity of the quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood estimation procedures to initial values assigned to state variables and starting parameters is investigated. A suggestion on choosing the initial value of state variables, without knowing the systemâs probability structure is given. Standard steps used to improve the grid search method for obtaining better estimation of unknown parameters, in nonlinear and non-Gaussian state space models, are established. Finally techniques developed in this thesis are applied to real data. Three datasets are considered: (i) the daily exchange rate of US Dollar/Australian Dollar and British Pound/Australian Dollar for the period from 1 / 1 / 2003 to 1 / 1 / 2006; (ii) the monthly number of cases of poliomyelitis reported by the U. S. Center for Disease Control for the years 1970 to 1983 and (iii) the exchange rates of Pound/Dollar from 1 / 10 / 81 to 28 / 6 / 85.

40|$|Process {{systems are}} prone to {{accidents}} as they deal with hazardous material at high temperature and/or pressure. Process plants are also characterized as complex systems where a dense cluster of pipes and equipment may cause a chain of accidents. Therefore, implementation and maintenance of safety measures through risk assessment is crucial to maintain risk below the acceptance criteria. Risk assessment methodologies such as quantitative risk analysis (QRA) and probabilistic safety analysis (PSA) comprise different steps among which accident scenario analysis is a common task. Accident scenario analysis includes accident sequence modeling and associated consequence assessment. Among many techniques available to conduct accident scenario analysis, bow-tie (BT) and Bayesian network (BN) are the most popular. Both techniques are graphical methods illustrating an accident scenario completely and taking advantage of robust probabilistic reasoning engines. BT technique addresses causes and consequences of an accident scenario in a transparent manner that is readily tractable and communicable with stakeholders. However, it suffers limitations of being static and unable to model <b>conditional</b> dependencies. These <b>limitations</b> significantly reduce BT's efficacy to do dynamic risk analysis. In the present study, Bayesian updating and real-time monitoring of operational parameters {{in the form of}} physical reliability models are used to overcome these limitations. Physical reliability models provided the analyst with a deeper insight into the behavior of risk while Bayes' rule helps to capture variations over time and to learn from experiences. Bayesian network is an alternative technique to conventional methods such as fault tree and bow-tie, with ample potential in risk assessment and safety analysis. Mapping fault tree and bow-tie into Bayesian network, it is shown that how conditional dependencies, multi-state variables, common cause failures can be considered and most importantly, probability updating can be conducted. Advanced aspects of Bayesian networks such as object-oriented Bayesian networks (OOBN) and discrete-time Bayesian networks (DTBN) are examined in this study. The former decomposes a large network to sub-models with desired level of abstraction, facilitating the modeling and capturing of dependencies. The latter explicitly takes time into account to model sequential failures by means of dynamic gates. To improve the performance of DTBN, an innovative algorithm is introduced {{to reduce the size of}} probability tables. Further, two new relationships are developed for dynamic gates cold spare and sequential enforcing gates to make them compatible with most distribution functions. Applying Bayesian networks in the field of domino effects, both propagation pattern and probability of domino effect at different stages are calculated. In this study, the efficacy of BN in safety analysis and accident scenario modeling of a variety of applications such as loss of well control, risk-based design of safety systems and domino effect is examined...|$|R
40|$|Causal {{inference}} methodology {{represents an}} analytical framework {{to evaluate and}} estimate causal effects based on observational data. This framework {{can be applied to}} examine and estimate individual contributions of causal factors in epidemiologic studies of aging. These studies are characterized by complex temporal relationships between these different factors, and confounders of these factors and outcomes of interest (i. e. time-dependent confounding). Unbiased estimation of effects under these conditions lies beyond the scope of conventional statistical methods. Causal inference methods allow for examination and unbiased estimation of population-level (i. e., marginal) effects, and can account for time-dependent confounding. Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) can be used to define causal parameters (i. e., marginal effects) of interest. History-adjusted marginal structural models (HAMSMs), a generalization of MSMs, can be used to define and evaluate marginal effects given time-varying covariates. 	These models were applied to examine the causal associations between different factors of interest and physical and cognitive functioning outcomes. Estimation procedures were applied (e. g., targeted maximum likelihood estimation, inverse-probability of treatment weights) to address time-dependent confounding in the data and provide unbiased estimates of the effects examined in these models, which {{would not have been possible}} with standard statistical methods. Study 1 Self-reported leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), based on metabolic equivalents, equal to or greater than public-health recommended-levels, and a measure of body composition (lean: fat mass ratio, L/F), estimated from bioelectric impedance using population-specific prediction equations derived from dual x-ray energy absorptiomery, were examined with respect to a measure of physical function that was based on standard self-report questions. In women 55 and older, a one-unit gain in L/F reduced by 65. 5 percent (95 % CI: 21. 8, 87. 4) the report of physical limitation at all four surveys of an 8 -year study. A similar reduction was not observed in men; however, there was a 3 percent increase in the report of no limitation at any survey. The effect of high levels of LTPA was a reduction in new physical limitation that occurred at the last survey of 36. 8 percent (95 % CI: 0. 0, 0. 92) and 52. 7 percent (95 % CI: 13. 5, 91. 9) in men and women, respectively. In summary, higher LTPA appeared to reduce the risk of future functional <b>limitation</b> <b>conditional</b> on the level of functioning established by L/F. Study 2 The association of lifetime household secondhand smoke exposure (SHS) and risk of incident dementia was examined in 970 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study who were never-smokers and were free of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), dementia, and mild cognitive impairment at baseline. Given prior studies have found that SHS is associated with increased risk of CVD and that CVD is associated with increased risk of dementia, interactions between SHS and measures of clinical and subclinical CVD on dementia risk were examined as well. Moderate (16 - 25 years) and high (> 25 years) SHS exposure levels were not independently associated with dementia risk; however, subjects with > 25 years of SHS exposure and > 25 % carotid artery stenosis had a three-fold increase (Hazard Ratio, 3. 00; 95 % Confidence Interval: 1. 03, 9. 72) in hazard of dementia, compared to subjects with no/low (0 - 15 years) SHS exposure and &# 8804; 25 % carotid artery stenosis. High lifetime SHS exposure may increase the risk of dementia in elderly with undiagnosed CVD. Study 3 Leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), based on metabolic equivalents, was examined with respect to walking speed (WS) that was based on standard protocol. A measure of body composition (Lean:fat mass ratio, L/F) (see Study 1), was included as a surrogate of metabolic function (e. g., glucose tolerance) and as a causal intermediate of LTPA and WS. In sex-specific analyses, the direct effects of LTPA on WS were estimated from four separate surveys of an 8 -year study, and pooled. Stratified analyses examined effect estimates in different subgroups (e. g., diabetics vs. non-diabetics). Mean WS increased (2. 394 ft/sec vs. 2. 238 ft/sec in women; 2. 418 ft/sec vs. 2. 278 ft/sec in men) with higher LTPA (i. e., greater or equal vs. less than public health recommended levels) and higher L/F (i. e. > median vs. median L/F (2. 394 ft/sec vs. 2. 316 ft/sec). Similar results were observed for the men. Results of the stratified analysis did not differ from the overall analysis. These results indicate a marginal level of direct protection of LTPA for WS, but underscore the influence of LTPA on metabolic intermediates that affect lower body-function. The application of MSMs and HAMSMs in these different studies illustrate their use to examine causal factors associated with cognitive and physical decline. Moreover, estimation procedures were employed to provide accurate estimates of effects based on these models of physical activity and other factors associated with function in the elderly...|$|R
