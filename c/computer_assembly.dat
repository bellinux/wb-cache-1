50|$|While it is {{possible}} to write computer programs as long lists of numbers (machine language) and while this technique was used with many early computers, it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs. Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember - a mnemonic such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP. These mnemonics are collectively known as a <b>computer's</b> <b>assembly</b> language. Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.|$|R
