Great efforts had been made to study new sizing to reduce costs and environment pollution. In this paper, Methyl <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> (MC) and hydroxypropyl methyl <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> (HPMC) were prepared by the hemp core and further used as a textile sizing. The chemical structure of the hemp <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> was characterized by the FTIR analysis. The paste viscosity was tested by the Viscometer. The sizing properties of hemp <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> were evaluated by the weaving process. The results indicated that the wrap breakage rat, weft breakage rate and loom efficiency of MC and HPMC blended sizing was similar to those of PVA sizing. Compared to COD in the desizing wastewater of 3600 mg/L of PVA, the COD of hemp sizing was very small. It was 330 mg/L. Therefore, it is concluded that the hemp core ether is a new and environment-friendly textile sizing, which has low cost and contributes a healthier ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{using a variety of}} <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> {{emulsions}} as a fat source, instead of a conventional shortening, on the structural changes occurring in a dough biscuit recipe during heating were studied. Linear viscoelastic properties and texture properties during heating were compared. In comparison to conventional shortenings, the <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> emulsions are a healthier option characterized by lower fat content, lower saturated fatty acids content and the absence of trans fatty acids. In the dough with shortening, temperature had the biggest influence on the viscoelastic properties, characterized by a decrease in viscoelasticiy within the temperature range from 25 ºC to 45 ºC. In the <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> emulsions dough the increase in temperature produced a slow linear decrease in the elastic and viscous moduli. At 80 ºC all dough showed similar viscoelastic behavior. The texture development during baking differed among the recipes. In the shortening dough the texture changes appeared since the first minute of heating, while in the emulsion dough, the effects were noticeable after 5 min of baking and varied according to the <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> thermal gelation properties.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> {{chemical}} substitution on {{the reduction of}} fat digestion in an o/w emulsion was investigated. Emulsions containing 47 % sunflower oil and water were prepared with two types of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and two types of methyl cellulose (MC), with different hydroxypropyl and methoxyl content. The changes in the emulsion structure were evaluated after mouth, stomach and small intestine in vitro digestion by Confocal laser microscopy and by small amplitude oscillatory shear (viscoelastic properties). The total amount of fat present in the supernatant after digesta centrifugation, serving {{as an indicator of}} fat bioaccessibility, and the free fatty acids, serving as an indicator of fat digestion, were determined {{at the end of the}} digestion. A relationship was found between <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> chemical substitution, initial structure, structural changes during digestion, fat bioaccessibility and fat digestion. All the <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> emulsions showed a lower level of fat digestion in comparison with a whey protein emulsion, the <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> containing the highest amount of methoxyl being the most effective. The rise in the methoxyl content increases the emulsion viscoelastic properties before and after digestion and reduces fat bioaccessibility and the generation of free fatty acids. The decrease in the fat digestibility of the <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> emulsions was mainly associated with a physical effect, which limits the emulsification of appropriate fats by bile salts, and the subsequent lipase digestion effect.

Dissolving pulp is so named because it is not made into paper, but dissolved either in a solvent or by derivatization into a homogeneous solution, which makes it completely chemically accessible and removes any remaining fibrous structure. Once dissolved, it can be spun into textile fibers (viscose or Lyocell), or chemically reacted to produce derivatized celluloses, such cellulose triacetate, a plastic-like material formed into fibers or films, or <b>cellulose</b> <b>ethers</b> such as methyl cellulose, used as a thickener.|$|E

40|$|Cellulose based derivatives, such as <b>cellulose</b> <b>ethers,</b> today {{find many}} {{applications}} in a {{diverse range of}} fields.

Novel dialkylamine derivatives of cellulose ether oligosaccharides were shown to increase the sensitivity in both MALDI- and nano-ESI-MS, and to facilitate structure analysis by MS/MS. Studies of the molar mass distribution of partially depolymerised MC were performed by size-exclusion chromatography semi-online to MALDI-MS.

40|$|The {{effects of}} water based shaping, {{by means of}} starch {{consolidation}} (SC), of an iron powder system regarding oxygen/carbon content and sintering performance were evaluated. Specifically, {{the influence of the}} drying conditions and the use of two different thickeners, xanthan gum and <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether,</b> were studied. The results showed that <b>cellulose</b> <b>ether</b> gave lower sintered density than xanthan gum, mainly because of less favourable rheological impact and air/gas entrapment at mould filling and consolidation. Due to less oxidation at drying and less removal of carbon at sintering, freeze dried specimens sintered to a higher density than room temperature air dried ones. The degree of oxidation and removal of carbon also influenced the as sintered microstructure. Ferrite grains surrounded by iron phosphide were found m both air dried and freeze dried specimens. However, the higher carbon content in freeze dried specimens also resulted in a significant amount of iron carbide grains (inclusions), which can be a potential strength limiting factor...|$|R
