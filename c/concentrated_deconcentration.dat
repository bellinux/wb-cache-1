40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the dynamics of}} the computer hardware industry in Ireland and Scotland in a global context, from its inception in the late 1950 s to the present. It provides a detailed account of plant openings and closures in both the system assembly and the component manufacturing segment. It describes the development of the computer hardware industry from mainframe assembly, through minicomputer assembly to microcomputer assembly and the shift of system assembly and component production activity to the Far East and Eastern Europe since the mid- 1990 s. The developments are analysed in terms of Schoenbergerâ€™s (1997) model of <b>concentrated</b> <b>deconcentration</b> in the context of time-based-competition. It is shown that the model, with substantial qualification, fits the developments since the 1980 s...|$|E
40|$|The {{attack on}} the World Trade Center will have a {{significant}} effect on urban development in New York City, not so much because it will change existing patterns, but because it will intensify them. The effect will come from the way leaders in the political and business community act after September 11 th, more than from what the attack itself accomplished. Among the key effects will be a further barricading of spaces within the city, a <b>concentrated</b> <b>deconcentration</b> of business activities away from the center and their citadelization. The process of public planning is increasingly irrelevant; deplanning might be a better word for it. Decision-making is concentrated in quasi-governmental bodies, freed from the obligation to follow democratic procedures. Business groups, particularly those involved in global processes, are well organized and are pressing for planning and for subsidies serving their interests. There is publicly-oriented activity also, but less focused and not (yet?) raising distributional and social justice issues as central concerns. The net result is a further skewing of the benefits and costs of globalization. Copyright Joint Editors and Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2002. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the processes of}} economic deconcentration {{that have occurred in}} Europe during the last fifteen years. Attention is particularly paid to fourteen case studies carried out in metropolitan areas in the Czech Republic (Prague and Brno), Denmark (Copenhagen and Aarhus), Israel (Tel Aviv and Beer-Sheva), Italy (Rome and Chieti-Pescara), the Netherlands (North Wing of Randstad and Breda), Spain (Madrid and Valladolid) and the United Kingdom (Bristol and Southampton). The aim {{of this paper is to}} establish a taxonomy of the forms of deconcentration in the studied metropolitan areas. The majority of the fourteen case study areas present a deconcentration process that concerns certain specific territories of the metropolitan areas. To some extent, this deconcentration can be defined as concentrated, in opposition to a scattered, diffused deconcentration. A <b>concentrated</b> <b>deconcentration</b> can be found in both case study areas in Denmark (Copenhagen and Aarhus), the Netherlands (North Wing of Randstad and Breda), the Czech Republic (Prague and Brno), Israel (Tel Aviv and Beer-Sheva), and in the mid-sized cities in Italy (Chieti-Pescara) and Spain (Valladolid). A dispersed deconcentration can be seen in the United Kingdom (Bristol and Southampton) and in the Italian and Spanish capital cities (Rome and Madrid). When the sectoral composition of deconcentration is analysed, there are three different possibilities: In the cities studied, a prevalence in the deconcentration of Services (in Copenhagen, Aarhus, North Wing of Randstad, Breda, Bristol, Southampton and Madrid) can be seen, followed by retailing (in Prague, Brno, Chieti-Pescara and Tel Aviv) and lastly by industry (in Valladolid, Rome and Beer-Sheva). A European model of deconcentration has the peculiarity of being very diversified. The historical wealth of the European cities is, in itself, a strong element of diversity. In some cases, due to its high value, cultural heritage constitutes an element of centripetal attraction and serves to slacken deconcentration. In other contexts, this same heritage favours centrifugal forces and enhances the deconcentration of space-consuming activities that, by their own intrinsic nature, must be located close to transport infrastructures...|$|E
