Pure lime sets very slowly through contact with carbon dioxide in the air and moisture; it is not a hydraulic lime so it will not set under water. Pure lime is pure white and can be used for whitewash, plaster, and mortar. Pure lime is soluble in water containing carbonic acid, a natural, weak acid which is a solution of carbon dioxide in water and acid rain so it will slowly wash away, but this characteristic also produces autogenous or self-healing process where the dissolved lime can flow into cracks in the material and be redeposited, automatically repairing the crack.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The addition of hydrated lime to clay soils {{is one of the most}} common methods of soil stabilization. However, when sulfates are present in the soil, the calcium in the lime reacts with the sulfates to form ettringite, an expandable mineral. This expansion causes a considerable amount of economical as well as structural problems. In this research, a field test method is developed to locate sulfate bearing soils. A permittivity probe is used to measure the electrical conductivity of the insitu soil. The electrical conductivity is then related to sulfate content in soils. Expansion tests were performed to determine the amount of expansion that occurs when lime is added to soils with different sulfate contents. A model that relates the amount of expansion of clay soils to electrical conductivity, is proposed. The use of low <b>calcium</b> <b>lime</b> stabilizers are investigated and proposed as alternative form of stabilizer for sulfate bearing soils...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} an attempt {{has been made}} to {{understand}} thehydrogeomorphological regime of the Vidrupa River basin by utilizing soil texture qualitative classification tool through both the field and laboratory analysis to determine the classes for agricultural soils based on their physical texture. The classes are distinguished in the field by the 'textural feel' which can be further clarified by separating the relative proportions of sand, silt and clay using grading sieves, the particle size distribution. The class is then used to determine crop suitability and to approximate the soils responses to environmental and management conditions such as drought or <b>calcium</b> (<b>lime)</b> requirements. Rainfall – runoff processes in tropical microcatchments are driven by a combination of factors like rainfall characteristics, soil physical conditions, slope gradients and vegetation types. Nevertheless, soil physical properties like texture and drainage conditions of the subsoil as well as slope gradients are key factors in runoff control under tropical rainfall with high storm event intensities and rainfall accumulations. Hydrological processes in tropical watersheds are strongly influenced by particular climatic, geomorphologic and soil conditions in the tropics. High temperature and wetness accelerate rock weathering and the formation of deep soil profiles is widely shown in the study area...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{improving}} the quality of lime mortar masonry by understanding the mechanics of mortars and masonry and their interaction. It investigates how the mortar?s compressive and flexural strengths impact the compressive and bond strength of clay brick masonry bound with <b>calcium</b> <b>lime</b> (CL) and natural hydraulic lime (NHL) mortars. It concludes that the strength of the bond has a greater impact on the compressive strength of masonry than the mortar?s strength. The masonry compressive strength increased proportionally to the strength of the bond up to 6 months. A regression analysis, giving a second order equation with coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 918, demonstrates a strong and predictable relationship between bond strength and masonry compressive strength. It was noted that CL 90 s mortar masonry reaching a high bond value was stronger than that built with a stronger mortar but displaying a poorer bond. Finally, the mechanics of lime mortars and their masonry are similar. The predominantly elastic behaviour of the mortars of higher hydraulic strength compares well with the elastic and brittle behaviour of their masonry, with either little (NHL 2) or non-existent plasticity (NHL 3. 5 and 5); in contrast, the CL 90 mortar and masonry exhibit a plastic behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{industrial}} lime production {{requires a}} strict control of material composition {{to ensure a}} constant production. XRF combined with borate fusion is commonly used in production laboratories because it provides fast and accurate analysis. Sample preparation problems arise with samples containing large amounts of carbonates. They are reported to foam and run over the crucible during the fusion. The sample also sticks badly {{on the side of}} crucible. New robust fusion procedures for lime products such as calcium carbonate, calcium oxide (dolomitic and high <b>calcium</b> <b>limes),</b> <b>calcium</b> hydroxide and calcium supplements are reported. A precise control over mixing and heat transfer allows to get specimens free of bubbles. The precision of the procedures is evaluated by calculating the standard deviation of net intensities of silica (SiO 2), alumina (Al 2 O 3), iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3), calcium oxide (CaO) and magnesium oxide (MgO). Special attention is paid to minor elements. The use of pre-fused flux with an integrated non-wetting agent is a factor to achieve a good precision on these elements...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{physical}} and chemical properties, mortars made with lime {{are considered to be}} more compatible with historic fabrics than those made with artificial cements. This paper explores the mechanical properties of clay brick masonry bound with hydraulic limes of different strengths, and hydrated <b>calcium</b> <b>lime</b> (CL 90 -s) with no hydraulic properties. Masonry wallettes built with a CL 90 -s mortar and two natural limes of hydraulic strengths 3. 5 and 5 MPa (NHL 3. 5 and NHL 5) respectively were tested for compressive and flexural strength. The strength of the bond between the mortar and the brick was also measured. The paper concludes that CL mortar masonry displays a plastic behaviour in compression while the mechanical behaviour of the HL mortar masonry is of a brittle nature, with wallettes splitting along the centre, cracks above and below the vertical joints and spalling of brick and mortar. It also concludes that neither the rate of late strength gain of masonry, nor its ultimate compressive strength or its bond strength are determined by the mortar nature, thus a mortar of low hydraulic strength can provide stronger masonry than an emminetly hydraulic mortar. The paper agrees with previous authors on that the masonry?s compressive strength is more sensitive to the brick-mortar bond strength than to the compressive strength of the mortar. Finally, the paper demonstrates that the NHL-mortar compressive strength increases at a higher rate, and reaches higher final values than that of the NHLmasonry whereas, in contrast, the CL 90 -s mortar is weaker in compression than the CL 90 -s mortar masonry...|$|E
30|$|Groundnut husk biochar (GHb) {{recorded}} the highest available phosphorus content and exchangeable cation {{and was also}} significantly different (P[*]<[*] 0.05) from the other biochars (Table  6). Available P contents the biochars were {{higher than that of}} the soil of the study area (Billa et al. 2017). However, P content had a non-significant correlation with carbonization temperature (r[*]=[*]−[*] 0.061, P[*]>[*] 0.01, Table  5). The exchangeable cations (Ca+, Mg 2 +, and Na+) contents in the biochars were higher than those of the adjacent soils of the study area (Billa et al. 2017). Soil acidity is due to one of the following factors: calcium or magnesium deficiency, aluminum and manganese toxicity or where hydrogen concentrations may inhibit or reverse cations uptake by plant roots (Baronti et al. 2014; Bayu et al. 2015). Also, the fixation and/or entrapment at specific sites between clay layers tend to be higher under acid conditions due to the presence of soluble aluminum that occupies the binding sites (Baronti et al. 2014). As liming is very expensive for most smallholder farmers, the use of biochar produced from these crop wastes could supply the required Ca+ and Mg 2 + which is more economical than calcitic lime or high <b>calcium</b> <b>lime</b> (50 – 56 % CaO, 1 – 4 % MgO), dolomitic lime (30 % CaO, 20 % MgO), gypsum (CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O) and hydrated lime (60 % CaO, 12 % MgO) (Baronti et al. 2014; Dotaniya et al. 2016). Also biochar issued from coffee, groundnut and rice husk would be a suitable biochar to enhance K, Ca, Mg, and Na availability, respectively (Baronti et al. 2014; Bayu et al. 2015). In addition, other properties of biochar such as bulk density, moisture and nutrient retention, and high CEC could help improve soil functions, as microbial activity and soil structure (Baronti et al. 2014; Chaudhuri et al. 2016).Therefore, the production of food crops such as cassava, rice and maize in the humid forest agroecological zone could be increased through the addition of biochar.|$|E
40|$|Magnesian lime is {{made from}} dolomitic limestone. The {{properties}} of magnesian lime mortars are not yet clearly established: some authors claim that Mg-lime has no hydraulicity and produces poor quality mortars that fracture, while others state that it produces quality hydraulic mortars. Here, Mg-lime was produced by burning magnesium limestone in a traditional limekiln. Mortars were made with increasing proportions of Mg-lime and <b>calcium</b> <b>lime</b> (CL 90), and tested according to both European and ASTM Standards, and RILEM recommendations. Shrinkage, compressive and flexural strengths, absorption, capillary suction, density and porosity were evaluated, and the relationships between workability (measured as initial flow), water demand and strength investigated. The process of lime production evidenced that fabrication parameters are instrumental {{on the quality of}} Mg-lime and the subsequent mortar?s performance. Temperatures over 900 ?C induced over-burning resulting in clinker formation and a lack of reactivity. The choice of kiln fuel and burning arrangement proved essential in order to reach a homogeneous calcination; and sieving of unslaked and over/underburnt particles as well as trials to determine raw feed proportions, were needed in order to avoid poor quality lime. Testing evidenced that the higher the Mg content, the greatest the mortar?s shrinkage. However, shrinkage did not reach unacceptable values and cracking didn?t occur. It was also evidenced that the Mg-lime possessed a lower water demand than the CL; and that Mg mortars behave well towards fluids (their capillary suction was lower and their porosity and absorption similar to those of CL 90 mortars). The results also suggest that Mg-lime mortars possess compressive and flexural strengths equivalent to those of some feebly-hydraulic lime mortars: Mg-lime strength falls within the EN 459 - 1 strength requirements for natural feebly-hydraulic lime. This research concludes that, providing production is correct, Mg-limes produce reliable masonry mortars which will shrink further but will possess a lower water demand and a slightly higher mechanical strength than CL mortars...|$|E
