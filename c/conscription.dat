5|$|Although {{this system}} of <b>conscription</b> survived into Eastern Han, <b>conscription</b> could be avoided upon payment of a commutable tax.|$|E
5|$|Two {{forms of}} mass <b>conscription</b> existed during the Han period. These were {{civilian}} <b>conscription</b> (gengzu 更卒) and military <b>conscription</b> (zhengzu 正卒). In addition to paying their monetary and crop taxes, all peasants of the Western Han period aged between fifteen and fifty-six {{were required to}} undertake mandatory <b>conscription</b> duties for one month of each year. These duties were usually fulfilled by work on construction projects.|$|E
5|$|Compulsory <b>conscription</b> was {{abolished}} in January 2008. Until 2008 {{military service}} was compulsory for men at age 18 and conscripts served six-month tours of duty, reduced in 2001 {{from the earlier}} scheme of nine-month <b>conscription</b> tours. Conscientious objectors could instead opt for an eight-month civilian service.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{support for}} a {{compulsory}} <b>conscription</b> bill rose after the massacres.|$|E
5|$|Throughout World War I the Australian forces {{deployed}} overseas {{were all}} volunteers, however, {{on the home}} front there was considerable debate about the issue of <b>conscription.</b> <b>Conscription</b> had been a contentious issue ever since Federation and when the AIF was initially raised in 1914 it had been decided that it would be an all-volunteer force due to the provisions of the Defence Act that precluded sending conscripts overseas. Nevertheless, as the war progressed, casualties amongst the deployed forces began to reach alarming rates and as the flow of reinforcements and recruits for the AIF began to drop in 1916, the issue of <b>conscription</b> rose once more.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Stephen Henderson {{maintains}} that Macdonald {{played a key}} role in the wartime <b>conscription</b> crises that beset the federal government in 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured <b>conscription</b> rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment. A committed internationalist, he believed it unfair that some bore the sacrifices of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that <b>conscription</b> was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized that in the early years of the war, voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to meet the needs of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|In Capitalism and Freedom, {{he argued}} that <b>conscription</b> is inequitable and arbitrary, {{preventing}} young men from shaping their lives as they see fit. During the Nixon administration he headed the committee to research a conversion to paid/volunteer armed force. He would later state that his role in eliminating the <b>conscription</b> in the United States was his proudest accomplishment. Friedman did, however, believe a nation could compel military training as a reserve in case of war time.|$|E
5|$|In all 416,806 Australians {{enlisted in}} the AIF {{during the war and}} 333,000 served overseas. 61,508 were killed and another 155,000 were wounded (a total {{casualty}} rate of 65%). The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £376,993,052. Two referendums on <b>conscription</b> for overseas service had been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves of manpower available, particularly {{towards the end of the}} fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to <b>conscription</b> during the war.|$|E
5|$|In the end, King {{was forced}} to impose {{overseas}} <b>conscription</b> after {{the failure of the}} voluntary recruitment campaign, but the war ended soon after and his government survived unscathed. The <b>conscription</b> crisis however, hardened the animosity between King and his naval minister. Macdonald, disillusioned by what he saw as the chicanery and ruthlessness of national politics, longed to return to Nova Scotia. After King called an election for June 11, 1945, Macdonald resigned from the federal cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Rashid Ali al-Gaylani {{presented}} {{the bill to}} the parliament, his government fell, however, before it was legislated and Jamil al-Midfai's government enacted <b>conscription</b> in February 1934.|$|E
5|$|Under the Military Service Act 1916, which {{introduced}} <b>conscription,</b> {{the provisions}} of the Act which prevented a Territorial soldier from being transferred to a different corps, or a regular unit, without his consent were suspended.|$|E
5|$|Around 375,000 Belgians {{also served}} in labour {{programs}} within Germany during the war, working in manual jobs in industry or agriculture for the German war effort. Though nearly 180,000 Belgians signed up before <b>conscription</b> began in 1941, most were conscripted after that date {{and worked as}} forced labour against their will.|$|E
5|$|As a backbencher, McCay opposed {{amendments}} to the Defence Act 1903 proposed by Billy Hughes of the Australian Labor Party that called for peacetime <b>conscription.</b> He accepted its necessity in wartime, but only for service within Australia. McCay believed that volunteers would always be plentiful, and he feared that peacetime <b>conscription</b> would result in militarism. He was re-elected unopposed in the 1903 election, the first in which Victorian women were eligible to vote. In 1904, McCay moved {{an amendment to the}} Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 to remove the clause that empowered the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to give preference to trade unions. The debate became unexpectedly heated and resulted in the fall of Chris Watson's Labor government. The Free Trade Party's George Reid became Prime Minister and offered McCay the post of Minister for Defence.|$|E
5|$|As {{chief of}} general {{staff of the}} Provisional Army of Germany, and later major general (after 1811) he was {{appointed}} 13 March 1812 as director-general of military <b>conscription,</b> a position which he held until the peace of 1814.|$|E
5|$|Charlton was an {{immediate}} success with Andrew Fisher and was promoted to the temporary chairmanship of committees in the House in 1913, however Charlton threatened to resign in 1915 over a dispute in government delays in granting the committee increased powers. Fisher mollified him and in 1916 Charlton proved his loyalty to the new Labor leader Billy Hughes by voting for Hughes' <b>conscription</b> referendum bill, {{even though he was}} vehemently opposed to <b>conscription</b> and fought hard against it. However, Charlton seemed to accept the affirmative result of the referendum and again proved his loyalty to Hughes by defending him when he became the target of caucus criticism. Charlton attempted to deflect attacks made on Hughes to a party conference, but Hughes left the party before a decision could be made.|$|E
5|$|Conscientious objectors (COs) {{refuse to}} {{participate}} in military service because of belief or religious training. During wartime, this stance conflicts with <b>conscription</b> efforts. Those willing to accept non-combatant roles, such as medical personnel, are accommodated. There are few legal options for draftees who cannot cooperate with the military in any way.|$|E
5|$|<b>Conscription</b> for the Army, {{but not for}} {{civilian}} industry, had been brought in {{during the first half}} of 1916. Towards the end of Asquith’s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville’s brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was beyond him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating <b>conscription</b> and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his support}} for <b>conscription,</b> Gould was not {{endorsed}} by the new Nationalist Party to contest the 1917 election. Deeply offended, Gould nevertheless elected to retire rather than run as an independent and split the Nationalist vote.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose <b>conscription</b> on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that <b>conscription</b> should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn Féin movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.|$|E
5|$|During the {{withdrawal}} from Estonia, the German command released thousands of native Estonian conscripts from military service. The Soviet command began conscripting Baltic natives as areas were brought under Soviet control. While some ended up serving on both sides, thousands joined the Forest Brothers partisan detachments to avoid <b>conscription.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{entered the}} Imperial University of Warsaw in 1902, but was soon {{expelled}} after {{taking part in}} protests against the Russian administration's curtailment of student rights. Threatened with <b>conscription</b> into the Imperial Russian Army, he chose to emigrate and in early 1904 left Warsaw for Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>conscription</b> {{was not in}} {{practice}} universal. Firstly, a land-based levy meant recruits were exclusively the sons of peasants, as opposed to townspeople. Thus some 20% of the empire's population was excluded. In addition, as during the Principate, slaves were not admissible. Nor were freedmen and persons in certain occupations such as bakers and innkeepers. In addition, provincial officials and curiales (city council members) could not enlist. These rules were relaxed only in emergencies, as during the military crisis of 405–6 (Radagaisus' invasion of Italy and the great barbarian invasion of Gaul). Most importantly, the <b>conscription</b> requirement was often commuted into a cash levy, at a fixed rate per recruit due. This was done for certain provinces, in certain years, although the specific details are largely unknown. It appears from the very slim available evidence that <b>conscription</b> was not applied evenly across provinces but concentrated heavily in the army's traditional recruiting areas of Gaul (including the two Germaniae provinces along the Rhine) and the Danubian provinces, with other regions presumably often commuted. An analysis of the known origins of comitatenses in the period 350–476 shows that in the Western army, the Illyricum and Gaul dioceses together provided 52% of total recruits. Overall, the Danubian regions provided {{nearly half of the}} whole army's recruits, despite containing only three of the 12 dioceses. This picture is much in line with the 2nd-century position.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 Morton {{attended}} the Loyal War Governors' Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, organized by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin, that gave Lincoln the support needed for his Emancipation Proclamation. Emancipation and the <b>conscription</b> {{of men to}} fight a protracted war became major issues that divided Republicans and Democrats during Morton's tenure as governor.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, 300,000 men {{had signed}} up to fight, and another 450,000 had joined-up {{by the end of}} September. Recruitment {{remained}} fairly steady through 1914 and early 1915, but it fell dramatically during the later years, especially after the Somme campaign, which resulted in 360,000 casualties. A prominent feature of the early months of volunteering was the formation of Pals battalions. Many of these pals who had lived and worked together, joined up and trained together and were allocated to the same units. The policy of drawing recruits from amongst the local population ensured that, when the Pals battalions suffered casualties, whole towns, villages, neighbourhoods and communities back in Britain were to suffer disproportionate losses. With the introduction of <b>conscription</b> in January 1916, no further Pals battalions were raised. <b>Conscription</b> for single men was introduced in January 1916. Four months later, in May 1916, it was extended to all men aged 18 to 41. The Military Service Act 1916 specified that men from the ages of 18 to 41 were liable to be called up for service in the army, unless they were married (or widowed with children), or served in {{one of a number of}} reserved occupations, which were usually industrial but which also included clergymen and teachers. This legislation did not apply to Ireland, despite its then status as part of the United Kingdom (but see <b>Conscription</b> Crisis of 1918). By January 1916, when <b>conscription</b> was introduced, 2.6 million men had volunteered for service, a further 2.3 million were conscripted before the end of the war; by the end of 1918, the army had reached its peak strength of four million men.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's volunteers {{responded to}} {{requests}} for military service {{in the early months}} of the war; however, as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased, the state government had to resort to <b>conscription</b> (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military <b>conscription,</b> which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, who viewed it as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an exemption for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E
5|$|Males {{and females}} that are 18 {{years of age}} up to 23 {{years of age and}} have {{graduated}} high school are eligible for military service. Those that do so are obliged 4 years of service. There is no <b>conscription</b> in Cameroon, but the government makes periodic calls for volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Married {{with two}} young children, Speirs would have been exempt from <b>conscription,</b> but he volunteered to join the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders in 1915. He was {{promoted}} to lance corporal, corporal and sergeant, and won the Military Medal for bravery in the field, but was killed during the Battle of Passchendaele in August 1917, {{at the age of}} 31.|$|E
5|$|Men {{who felt}} {{compelled}} to protest the restrictions of the <b>conscription</b> law attempted to disrupt the program {{through the use of}} various techniques, including the initiation of work slowdowns and labor strikes. Routine rule breaking frustrated camp directors. The most difficult cases were given to the federal court system and the men imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Most of Belarus's {{service members}} are conscripts, who serve for 12 months {{if they have}} higher {{education}} or 18 months if they do not. Demographic decreases in the Belarusians of <b>conscription</b> age have increased the importance of contract soldiers, who numbered 12,000 in 2001. In 2005, about 1.4% of Belarus's gross domestic product was devoted to military expenditure.|$|E
5|$|Numerous smaller strikes {{occurred}} in the Congo later in the war, though not on the same scale as in 1941. In 1944 strikes broke out in Katanga and Kasaï, provoked by the <b>conscription</b> of workers for the mines and deteriorating working conditions. In 1945, riots and strikes occurred among the black dockworkers in {{the port city of}} Matadi.|$|E
5|$|On 24 March 1878 Sienkiewicz {{left the}} U.S. for Europe. He first stayed in London, {{then for a}} year in Paris, delaying his return to Poland due to rumors of {{possible}} <b>conscription</b> into the Imperial Russian Army {{on the eve of}} a predicted new war with Turkey.|$|E
5|$|The Malaysian Armed Forces {{have three}} branches, the Royal Malaysian Navy, the Malaysian Army, and the Royal Malaysian Air Force. There is no <b>conscription,</b> and the {{required}} age for voluntary military service is 18. The military uses 1.5% of the country's GDP, and employs 1.23% of Malaysia's manpower.|$|E
5|$|The <b>conscription</b> of German men at {{the start}} of the war created a {{manpower}} shortage in German factories important for the war effort. From 1915, the Germans encouraged Belgian civilians to enlist voluntarily to work in Germany but the 30,000 recruits of the policy proved insufficient to meet demands.|$|E
5|$|The {{imposition}} of new taxation categories {{that were a}} departure from both secular Ottoman law and the traditionally accepted Islamic law drew local Muslim anger at the authorities. However, the principal point of contention between the authorities and the notables of Jerusalem and Nablus was the <b>conscription</b> order by Ibrahim Pasha on 25 April 1834. That day, Ibrahim Pasha convened {{with all of the}} clan leaders from both cities to demand the drafting of one out of every five Muslim men of fighting age. The order would begin with the <b>conscription</b> of 200 men from Jerusalem, a combined 3,500 men from Sanjak al-Quds and Sanjak Nablus, and 500 men from Hebron. By May 1834, the only prominent ally of the Egyptians in Palestine was the Abd al-Hadi clan.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure the}} army {{received}} sufficient recruits, Diocletian {{appears to have}} instituted systematic annual <b>conscription</b> of Roman citizens {{for the first time}} since the days of the Roman Republic. In addition, he was probably responsible for the decree, first recorded in 313, compelling the sons of serving soldiers and veterans to enlist.|$|E
5|$|Until 2011, {{military}} service was compulsory for men at age 18, and conscripts served six-month tours of duty; conscientious objectors could instead opt for an equal length of Zivildienst (civilian service), or a six-year commitment to (voluntary) emergency services like a fire department or the Red Cross. In 2011 <b>conscription</b> was officially suspended {{and replaced with}} a voluntary service.|$|E
