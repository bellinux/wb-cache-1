5000|$|In a {{building}} in Amsterdam, an elevator inexplicably begins to function alone. After a lightning storm causes a power failure and traps four people in the elevator, the elevator will not open after even after a subsequent power restore and the passengers almost suffocate. Soon, subsequent malfunctions prove fatal as an elderly blind man falls to his death when the elevator doors open to an empty shaft, the building night watchman is decapitated by the elevator doors, and a janitor is snared in the shaft in which his body drops through the elevator <b>ceiling</b> <b>hatch.</b>|$|E
50|$|It was {{powered by}} a , {{eighteen}} cylinder Salmson 18 Cm. This {{was one of the}} last, and the most powerful, of Salmson's water-cooled radial engines, with two in-line rows of nine cylinders. It was enclosed in a rounded cowling with caps over the cylinder-heads. Fuel was held in the wing centre-section and two Lamblin radiators were mounted on the undercarriage legs. Behind the engine the fuselage was rectangular in section, defined by light-metal, U-section longerons and cross-frames. The open cockpit was at the wing leading edge, with small side-windows for a better view downwards. Behind the cockpit the cabin seated six passengers, each with their own window. Entry was via a port-side door and there was a disposable emergency <b>ceiling</b> <b>hatch</b> to allow passengers to escape by parachute.|$|E
50|$|As of 2011 the school's {{interior}} {{has been}} preserved and restored {{to show its}} original function. The vestibule contains coathooks and a few shelves for students' lunchboxes, {{as well as a}} wash basin. Early-to-mid-20th-century desks, wood benches along the sidewalls, and the original blackboards from 1891 still decorate the classroom. The wood floor and wainscoting are original to the building, while the upper walls and ceiling were modified in the 20th century. At the head of the classroom the teacher's desk is an antique from a different school, acquired in recent years, but behind it is the school's original map cabinet with maps dated 1892. Nearby is a fuel oil stove, which replaced an earlier coal-burning stove. A door in the north wall leads to the coal shed, which also contains a narrow cabinet once used to store art supplies. The rear of the classroom includes a cabinet added in the 1920s to house the school's library. A <b>ceiling</b> <b>hatch</b> nearby leads to an attic space, which includes a rope bell pull for the belfry.|$|E
500|$|The large kitchens {{occupy the}} {{south-east}} {{angle of the}} castle. The [...] high main kitchen has two [...] wide fireplaces for cooking, and a circular vent in the vaulted <b>ceiling.</b> <b>Hatches</b> in the floor give access to a well ( [...] deep) and cellars below. The adjacent passage linked {{the kitchen to the}} hall in the east range.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1976 began mass {{production}} next update ZiU- 682V, which replaced ZiU- 682B [...] Due {{to the presence of}} design flaws that emerged during the first years of operation, rather than jet thrust bearing elements as suspension springs were used [...] Since 1976, the number of fixtures in the cabin has been reduced from 12 to 11, every other window in the cabin lost air vents [...] Since 1978, the number of <b>ceiling</b> <b>hatches</b> reduced to three (due to hatch on the front axle [...] ), steel trolley equipped with electric shtangoulovitelyami (apparently on the orders, since their machines Moscow was not until 1996 [...] ) [...]|$|R
5000|$|In August 1972, began {{production}} of the first production series ZiU-682B (with designation change ZiU ZiU -9 -682 {{was due to the}} labeling requirements of bringing industry classifier). First serial trolley cars differed from later releases. Until 1974, had an angular wheel arches, and not circular. The first batch of trolleybuses raised outdated engine DC-207G, which in 1973 was replaced by the DC-210 110 kW. Suspension on the first ZiU-682B was pneumatic, with torque rods as guiding elements, later became pnevmoressornoy. Rear funded playground had a reduced level of the floor, which reduced the number of steps one at the back door and to facilitate loading wheelchairs and prams and large items. However, this [...] "advantage" [...] was leveled by a high handrail on the steps of separating the rear and middle doors. Transition from high floor in the cabin to lower smoothly carried out in the aisle between the rear wheel arches, which caused inconvenience to passengers at peak hours (especially in winter), standing on an icy downhill [...] "hill." [...] In 1991, developers have replaced high-speed separator handrail attached to the door, but by this time all storage sites were at three stages from sidewalk level. For natural ventilation the roof of the cabin was equipped with four <b>ceiling</b> <b>hatches,</b> each equipped with a sliding side window pane. Currently, the only instance of ZIU-9B is preserved and operated in the linear regime in the city of Zaporozhye and has the side number 562.|$|R
50|$|In {{an attic}} where Cipur's nest was in, Cipur tells Willy {{that he wanted}} to read and write like a human because he was fascinated by their {{knowledge}} and technology, but he keeps this as a secret in fear of being shunned by the other sparrows. He makes a deal with Willy that if he teaches the young sparrow how to fly, Willy will teach Cipur how to read. As the flying lesson was underway, Sissy finds Willy and Cipur and attacks. Before she could eat Willy, Cipur intervenes and lures an angry Sissy atop the roof where he trapped her head under the weight of a <b>ceiling</b> <b>hatch.</b> Under Cipur's care, Willy is taught how to fly, and in return, Willy teaches Cipur how to read and write. One day, when Cipur went to find some food, Willy decides to venture out in the open to explore the outside world after learning how to fly properly. He flies back to the park and joins a flock of young sparrow, led by Red. They decided to show Willy the barn they used to hang out, until it was taken over by a big, black cat named Blackie.|$|E
50|$|Visibly shaken, Hank quickly {{explains}} that something outside (which he claims {{looks like an}} alien) is killing people {{and was about to}} get him. Ben disbelieves the guard's story and attempts to send the elevator back down but finds that he can't control it. Hank reveals he used the card and Ben angrily tries to grab it from him, but is repelled back when Hank takes out a spring-assisted knife to defend himself. Eventually, Ben restrains Hank while Ellen tries to call the lift telephone for help, to no avail. The elevator rocks and the lights go out, causing the three to stop. Ben reveals he has claustrophobia and uses Hank's knife to open the elevator panel and fiddle with the controls in order to operate the lift, but Hank stops him. Ben then tries to get the lift <b>ceiling</b> <b>hatch</b> open, but Hank stops him and tells him and Ellen that the monsters outside will get in and kill all of them. The lift becomes operational once again and Ellen manages to wrestle the card away from the men and use it to send the elevator down to the garage. Ben, desperate {{to be out of the}} lift, presses the button for floor 39.|$|E
50|$|Leaving {{behind their}} past, Artemis Entreri and Jarlaxle Baenre become mercenaries in {{the lands of}} Damara and Vaasa where fame and glory await any who seek it. They are hired by two dragon sisters, Ilnezhara and Tazmikella, to uncover {{artifacts}} left behind by Zhengyi the Witch-King, a powerful lich who ruled the region for many years before falling {{to the power of}} King Gareth Dragonsbane and his allies. In search of adventure, glory, and treasure, the pair of unlikely heroes embarks on their mission to destroy, or retrieve, the remaining remnants of Zhengyi's power. In the village of Palishchuk, a half-orc woman, Arrayan Faylin, falls under the spell of the vanquished Zhengyi when she attempts to decipher a tome he left behind. The spell drains her life force to form an exact replica of Castle Perilous, the citadel from which the Witch-King once ruled. Jarlaxle and Entreri join forces with a group of adventurers, including Commander Ellery, legendary hero Mariabronne the Rover, assassins Athrogate and Canthan, the half-elf warrior Calihye, and half-orcs Arrayan and Olgerkhan and set out to investigate the fortress facsimile. After a battle against some monsters, Calihye's close friend, Parissus is killed falling out of a wagon driven by Entreri. Blaming him for the woman's death, Calihye vows to kill him but has different thoughts after Entreri effortlessly disarms her and promises to kill her slowly if she ever threatens him again. As with the original Castle Perilous, the citadel's magic creates an endless supply of gargoyles, who begin to attack the heroes, as well as the poorly defended town of Palishchuk, where Calihye and another injured member of their party are nestled. Jarlaxle and company defeat the gargoyles easily enough and manage to infiltrate the castle, where they split up. Arrayan, having sustained too many wounds compounded with the life-draining burden of the spell, is on her last legs. The wizard Canthan turns on Entreri but proves to be overmatched by the dangerous assassin and is perfunctorily killed. In a rare moment of compassion, Entreri drags the dying body of Arrayan's lover, who is also sharing the burden of the castles dark magic, over to Canthan, and, as the wizard breathes his last breath, places the half-orc's hand upon his dagger to suck Canthan's remaining life force and heal her. An isolated Mariabronne stumbles upon a chamber with demon eggs hanging from the <b>ceiling.</b> The eggs <b>hatch</b> and Mariabronne manages to defeat them, but is stung in the process and injected with deadly venom. Commander Ellery is left alone with Jarlaxle and attempts to assassinate him. A fight promptly ensues, although Jarlaxle seems reluctant to kill her, as they have been lovers for some time and the opportunistic mercenary would always prefer to bed women than slay them, but Entreri shows up and mortally wounds her with his jeweled dagger. When the remnants of the band reunite, Athrogate takes it upon himself to do what Canthan could not and proceeds to duel against Entreri. Despite all his considerable skill, Entreri's parry and thrust style of fighting is no match for Athrogate's deadly morningstars. He would have promptly been killed but for Jarlaxle, who tosses a dimensional hole concealed in his hat at the dwarf. Athrogate becomes imprisoned in a void and agrees to obey Jarlaxle in return for his freedom. The five remaining companions venture {{into the heart of the}} castle, where they are met by a powerful dracolich who served as a minion for Zhengyi. Seemingly unstoppable, the dracolich gives the heroes a hellacious fight, but is finally defeated when Entreri's enchanted dragon statue spews dragon flame upon it. Jarlaxle, never one to pass up powerful magic, quickly salvages the soul of the dracolich, contained in a skull pendant, as well as a magical figurine for summoning a nightmare steed off Mariabronne's corpse.|$|R
