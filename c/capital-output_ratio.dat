50|$|The Incremental <b>Capital-Output</b> <b>Ratio</b> (ICOR), is {{the ratio}} of {{investment}} to growth which is equal to 1 divided by the marginal product of capital. The higher the ICOR, the lower the productivity of capital or the marginal efficiency of capital. The ICOR {{can be thought of}} as a measure of the inefficiency with which capital is used.

50|$|First, it is {{not always}} {{possible}} to draw a rigid functional relation between the level of per capita and the rate of growth of population and rate of growth in total income. Main causes of growth in population in most of the underdeveloped countries in recent decades have been reduction in death rates due to improvements in public health and the control of epidemics and endemics, which were not closely related to prior rise in per capita income level. The functional level of per capita income and the level of growth in total income is still more complex and, according to Myint takes place in two steps. The relation between the level of per capita income and the rate of saving and investment is modified by number of factors such as pattern of distribution of income and effectiveness of financial institution in mobilizing savings. The relation between investment and the resultant output is also not given by stable <b>capital-output</b> <b>ratio,</b> but depends on how far the productive organization of the country can be improved and how far land- savings innovations can be adopted to overcome the tendency to diminishing returns on additional investment which will continue even after the population growth has levelled off at 3 percent per annum.|$|E
50|$|Michał Kalecki's joining of the SGPiS in 1961 {{marked a}} new stage in the {{scientific}} career of Łaski. He belonged to the inner circle of Kalecki’s collaborators, and {{the main focus of}} his work shifted to the growth theory of socialist economy. He gave one of the key presentations (together with Włodzimierz Brus) at the Congress of the International Economic Association in Vienna in 1962 and published in Ekonomista several papers on the factors of growth of the national income, on the effects of external trade on the rate of growth, and {{on the role of the}} choice of production methods in determining the growth rate of consumption and national income. Among other topics, he analyzed the effects of a one-time reduction of the <b>capital-output</b> <b>ratio</b> on the short- and long-term proportions in the growth process. Łaski also published more general papers on full employment, resource allocation and developing economies. His extensive studies on the growth theory culminated in one of his main works On the theory of socialist reproduction. The book was considered a classical work on the growth theory in socialism, was used as a textbook at Polish universities, and was translated into the Czech language. Together with Michał Kalecki, Łaski chaired a workshop on the growth theory, which soon became an assembly point of a group of predominantly young research fellows interested in the planning theory. Several scholars who subsequently became renowned both in Poland and abroad originated from this group. A further main focus of Łaski’s research and teaching activities was the course for economists from the developing countries. In 1968, the circle around Michał Kalecki fell victim to the attacks of the antisemitic campaign. One - though not the only - reason for these attacks was the intellectual autonomy of the circle which contradicted the authoritarian claims of the system, even if Kalecki's associates took a definitely pro-socialist stance. Thereupon Łaski emigrated to Austria.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} accounting literature {{almost always}} assumes a Cobb-Douglas (CD) production function.

We use international data on relative factor shares and <b>capital-output</b> <b>ratios</b> to formulate a number of tests for {{the validity of the}} CD assumption.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the overall performance of the Tunisian economy between 1962 and 1971, {{the period of the}} Ten Year Perspective Plan. In the process of the analysis, certain problems of measurement and the solutions adopted are discussed in detail. The manufacturing sector is singled out for special emphasis. Three measures are developed for the analysis: <b>capital-output</b> <b>ratios,</b> capital-labor ratios, and out-labor ratios. These measures are calculated on a disaggregated basis. The major findings are that, though by international standards the performance of the Tunisian economy was very good, the heavy investments concentrated in relatively few industries did not produce commensurate results. The detailed analysis showed that particularly in the public sectors, investments produced insufficient output, were very capital-intensive, and yet produced inadequate output per man.

In the past decade the US manufacturing sector displayed a noticeable deceleration of capital accumulation and capital intensity increase, a trend that diverges from the one observed in the other two sectors of the economy: in agriculture and in services.
