That relationship backrest with the law of Kaldor-Thirwall, that emphasizes the importance of the foreign trade as an engine of the growth, and the emergence of economies characterized by an export-led growth pattern. Though, the endogeneity between economic growth and exports evidences the need of appropriate econometric specifications, including the approach of the instrumental variables. The model of dynamic panels developed by Arellano and Bond (1991) it is a justifiable solution for this situation, being considering that the official data sources for the formation of panels of companies usually have short periodicity. To correct the endogeneity of models, the present work uses the Brazilian <b>commercial</b> partners` <b>GDP</b> as instrumental variable. The found results suggest the existence of positive impacts of the exports on the Brazilian industrial companies, when the dynamic models are used, even after using this instrument in the estimate in two steps. ...|$|R

The objective {{of this research is}} to evaluate the IRES by comparing its monetary cost with its benefits as measured by Brazilian GDP growth. Estimates are carried out using input-output matrix. The results suggest that each Brazilian real spent by IRES to assist Brazilian family farms increases Brazilian GDP by R$ 1. 75 and that each real spent to assist <b>commercial</b> farms increases <b>GDP</b> by R$ 3. 57. The IRES is a subsidy that generates economic growth greater than its cost to society. IRES subsidy, growth, input-output matrix, Agricultural Finance, Q 18, C 67, O 40, H 81,...|$|R

This paper assesses total energy demand, which is composed of traditional energy (wood fuel) and commercial energy (electricity and petroleum), in the Central, East, South, and West regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. Cross-sectional time series data for 20 countries in 25 Â years are analyzed, {{and the results of}} the study show that wood fuel accounts for 70 % of energy consumption, followed by petroleum, with most industrial activities utilizing some form of wood fuel. Regression results suggest that energy demand is inversely related to the price of petroleum and industrial development, but positively related to GDP, population growth rate, and agricultural expansion, and that price elasticity is less than one. The model results also show that there are regional differences in energy demand. In addition, the interaction of population growth rates by regions generates mixed results, and there are regional differences in the use of commercial energy consumption, and GDP growth. The findings of this study suggest that countries must diversify their energy sources and introduce energy-efficient devices and equipment at all levels of the economy to improve GDP growth rate and GDP per capita.

Time series published data collected include agricultural <b>GDP,</b> <b>commercial</b> banks agricultural credit, cash reserve ratio and commercial banks lending rate. A multiple regression analysis approach involving the use of ordinary least (OLS) estimation techniques was adopted. Repayment ability of agricultural sector has a positive and significant effect on commercial banks credit supply to agriculture while lending rate has a positive and insignificant effect on banks agricultural credit supply. Cash reserve ratio has a negative and significant effect on commercial banks agricultural credit supply. Commercial bank agricultural credit supply is inelastic with respect to all the explanatory variables. Productivity in agricultural sector should be increased to attract commercial banks credit. Cash reserve ratio should be reduced to empower commercial banks to lend to agricultur...|$|R

This study evaluates the feasibility of radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) to guide the detection and delineation of tumours intraoperatively. The 3 D point-response function of a <b>commercial</b> gamma-ray-detecting probe (<b>GDP)</b> was determined {{as a function of}} radionuclide (131 I, 111 In, 99 mTc), energy-window threshold, and collimator length (0. 0 – 3. 0 -cm). This function was used to calculate the minimum detectable tumour volumes (MDTVs) and the minimum tumour-to-background activity concentration ratio (T:B) for effective delineation of a breast tumour model. The GDP had larger MDTVs and a higher minimum required T:B for tumour delineation with 131 I than with 111 In or 99 mTc. It was shown that for 111 In there was a benefit to using a collimator length of 0. 5 -cm. For the model used, the minimum required T:B required for effective tumour delineation was 5. 2 ± 0. 4. RIGS has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of breast-conserving surgery; however, before these benefits can be realized, novel radiopharmaceuticals need to be developed that have a higher specificity for cancerous tissue in vivo than what is currently available...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} multivariate {{multilevel}} modeling of panel data originated from smallholder farm surveys in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries and Vietnam to investigate driving forces in maize and rice production in SSA and diversification of {{farms in the}} rice sector in Vietnam. We also present and evaluate different tests for endogeneity in explanatory binary variables in multivariate linear regression models. Paper I discusses drivers behind changes in rice production in SSA. Drivers of production were a combination of area expansion, market integration, farm technology in terms of fertilizer and tractor ploughing, village elite membership and key macro level conditions such as rice imports and GDP per capita. Rice production increase is primarily associated with area expansion and commercial drivers during the period. The role of commercialization changes in production suggests that policies hold great potential for driving rice production in SSA. Paper II focuses on the drivers behind changes in maize production. It is shown that the drivers of production were a combination of area expansion, market integration, farm technology in terms of fertilizer and ploughing, village elite membership and key macro level conditions including share of budget to agriculture and import of maize with some exception within time frame in 2002 and 2008. Maize production increases are primarily associated with area expansion, ploughing, <b>commercial</b> drivers, <b>GDP</b> per capita and village elite membership. Paper III discuss different tests for endogeneity in explanatory binary and counting variables {{to take into account}} different aspects of the possible dependence structure between the variable and the disturbance in regression model. The study is shown how approximate equivalent tests can be obtained using the commonly used technique of ‘adding residuals’ to the regression model and which corresponds to tests based on differences of regression parameter estimates obtained under different assumptions. Paper IV investigates the power of some test statistics for testing endogeneity in case of binary endogenous variables. Statistics based on correlations between residuals in the studied regression and the endogenous variable, are studied and compared with the technique of testing significance of the added residual in the studied regression and also the standard Hausman test of endogeneity. Paper V aims to analyse the income diversification patterns of total income of rice farming households in two regions of Vietnam- the Mekong River Delta (MRD) and the Red River Delta (RRD). Two indices; less dominance of rice income, and less dominance of non-farm income of the total household income and their changes over time, defines four categories of farmers: 1) High diversified, 2) Ascenders, 3) Descenders, and 4) Low diversified. In MRD we found that education as resource/wealth, differences in rice production and incomes for households showed a significant effect on total income at the later time frame. Ascenders increased their share of all other incomes but rice, mostly shift to non-farm incomes i. e., out of rice dependence. In the RRD region only initial higher income level effected in income in 2005. The ascenders increased their incomes substantially while the descenders, more dependent on rice income, sharp fall in income. Higher education level and smaller farm sizes reduce the importance of education and rice productivity changes in RRD...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been done on the relationship between financial development (FD) and growth (with the main focus on economic growth). Theoretical models and most of the conclusions reached stipulate that the development of a financial system is one of the essential ingredients for economic growth. A developed financial system is able to provide financial services efficiently to the real sector. This study examines the relationship between FD and manufacturing sector growth of the SACU countries. The study first reviews the theoretical and empirical literature of FD and growth (economic and manufacturing sector). This gives a full understanding of the topic before attempting to empirically study it. It also helps in the selection process of the model and variables to be employed in the study. A balanced panel for four SACU countries, namely Botswana, Lesotho, RSA and Swaziland, for the period 1976 to 2008 was estimated using Zellner‟s Seemingly Unrelated Regression Estimation (SURE) method. Namibia was omitted because of limited data. The SURE model was selected because it performs better than ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation of individual equations in cases where the countries studied can be affected by similar external shocks because they are in the same economic region and also have country specific structural differences which could affect their economic growth. Two measures of FD were used: credit to the private sector provided by commercial banks (FIC) and the ratio of liquid liabilities of <b>commercial</b> banks to <b>GDP</b> (LL). Manufacturing sector growth was measured by manufacturing value added to GDP. The results of the relationship between manufacturing growth and FD were very weak across the countries. The model that used FIC performed better, there was a negative significant relationship found in RSA and Swaziland, while with the model that used LL, all the countries gave an insignificant relationship. The results for Swaziland were very consistent with the past findings of the relationship between FD and economic growth in the country (for example Aziakpono (2005 a)). This may be because of the high share of the manufacturing sector in GDP. Theory suggests that a well-developed financial system will {{have a positive impact on}} growth, but this was not the case in RSA and Botswana, where in some cases FD had a negative impact on the growth of the sector. The analysis of the countries‟ manufacturing sector development shows that the sector plays an important role in the economies of the SACU countries, especially in terms of employment and exports. The coefficients of trade openness are generally positive, though not significant in some cases. The other control variables gave mixed results across the counties and across the models. Based on the findings, the countries have to develop strategies that will improve entrepreneurial skills. Also the financial development in the small SACU countries is essential in order for all the sectors in the economy to benefit from the financial sector and in turn increase economic growth...|$|R
