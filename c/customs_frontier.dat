Due to lack of knowledge of the Croatian literature on these issues, the author is mainly restricted to the Hungarian aspect of the topic. By analyzing the transportation of goods on the Drava River by ferry boats, or over bridges, the following can be asserted: - compared to the former sporadic and low-volume shipments, traffic increased rapidly from 1868 to 1918; - ships allowed to ply once again as well as the ferry boats and bridges over the Drava River created conditions for trade; - the absence of <b>customs</b> <b>frontiers,</b> as a result of political decisions, caused an increase of contacts between the Hungarian and Croatian sides (although for this reason only few data are available for present-day analysts!); - the Drava Valley functioned as a unique economic territory and the inhabitants of both sides of the river were in everyday contact.

40|$|This model, in {{comparison}} to Weber's classical theory is based on few and weak hypotheses {{but they can be}} easily and adequately tested. Neither location figures (Standortsfigur) are supposed nor transport area, transport costs proportional to weight and distance, uniform and equal in every place prices of inputs and outputs are postulated in the model. The places for offering the effectively utilized inputs and the places for marketing the effectively used up outputs are no longer data a priori, but they are determined by the model. The environment of the production unit is enriched because passing points and noteworthy places are taken into account. Geographical data are no longer considered to be a distortion of the perfect economic model, but they are formalized and integrated into the theoretical model. The number and location of multiple establishments are determined in the cases in with they should exist. The dimensions of the establishments and their productive capacity are also taken into consideration, but as dependent variables. Besides, the model admits various extensions by means of some extra complications. It is possible to introduce one or more monetary frontiers. To do so it is sufficient to partition the H and H' p-graphs suitably, according to the case, and utilize one or more multipliers equal to the coefficients of change. It is also possible to consider one or several <b>customs</b> <b>frontiers</b> provided that multipliers corresponding to the regulations in each partial subgroup of graphs are introduced. The same holds also in the case of taxes and subventions that would come into question. They will be considered in each partial subgroup, in the H p-graph or the H' p-graph, according to the financial properties represented by their institutions. According to all the rigours the elementary model evidently tolerates those complications provided that the hypothesis of perfect competition is intact, from which their economic neutrality results. The more realistic models issued from the elementary model are exempt from those restrictions. The model presented here, however, remains static. Its dynamization is a question for the future. It has been considered in the quoted case of a model extended to the situation of oligopoly. Lastly this model makes possible the inclusion of classical Weberian theories of location as particular cases because their integration would take for gnanted only a restricted interpretation of the hypotheses and of data as well as a passage from the topological graphs to the metric graphs.

5000|$|Historian Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893 {{advanced}} the Frontier Thesis, under which American {{democracy and the}} American Dream were formed by the American frontier. He stressed the process—the moving frontier line—and the impact it had on pioneers going through the process. He also stressed results; especially that American democracy was the primary result, along with egalitarianism, {{a lack of interest}} in high culture, and violence. [...] "American democracy was born of no theorist's dream; it was not carried in the Susan Constant to Virginia, nor in the Mayflower to Plymouth. It came out of the American forest, and it gained new strength each time it touched a new frontier," [...] said Turner. In the thesis, the American frontier established liberty by releasing Americans from European mindsets and eroding old, dysfunctional <b>customs.</b> The <b>frontier</b> had no need for standing armies, established churches, aristocrats or nobles, nor for landed gentry who controlled most of the land and charged heavy rents. Frontier land was free for the taking.

Turner elaborated on the theme in his advanced history lectures and in a series of essays published over the next 25 years, published along with his initial paper as The Frontier in American History. Turner's emphasis on the importance of the frontier in shaping American character influenced the interpretation found in thousands of scholarly histories. By the time Turner died in 1932, 60% of the leading history departments in the U.S. were teaching courses in frontier history along Turnerian lines.|$|R

5000|$|Tod {{continued}} his surveying {{work in this}} physically-challenging, arid and mountainous area. His responsibilities were extended quickly: initially involving himself with the regions of Mewar, Kota, Sirohi and Bundi, he soon added Marwar to his portfolio and in 1821 was also given responsibility for Jaisalmer. These areas were considered a strategic buffer zone against Russian advances from the north which, it was feared, might result in a move into India via the Khyber Pass. Tod believed that to achieve cohesion it was necessary that the Rajput states should contain only Rajput people, with all others being expelled. This would assist in achieving stability in the areas, thus limiting {{the likelihood of the}} inhabitants being influenced by outside forces. According to Ramya Sreenivasan, a researcher of religion and caste in early modern Rajasthan and of colonialism, Tod's [...] "transfers of territory between various chiefs and princes helped to create territorially consolidated states and 'routinised' political hierarchies." [...] His successes were plentiful and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes that Tod was [...] so successful in his efforts to restore peace and confidence that within less than a year some 300 deserted towns and villages were repeopled, trade revived, and, in spite of the abolition of transit duties and the reduction of <b>frontier</b> <b>customs,</b> the state revenue had reached an unprecedented amount. During the next five years Tod earned the respect of the chiefs and people, and was able to rescue more than one princely family, including that of the ranas of Udaipur, from the destitution to which they had been reduced by Maratha raiders.|$|R

TRIPS agreement and border enforcement of IPRS [...] Chapter 4. Role of Customs as a border security agency [...] Chapter 5. Socio-economic impacts of IPR enfringement [...] Chapter 6. Conclusion and recommendations. In the present era of rapid globalisation, countries are intrinsically integrated {{with each other}} by way of international trade to ensure optimal utilisation of their resources. Trade facilitation is now recognised as a key driving factor in determining export competitiveness of a country. <b>Customs</b> administrations, the <b>frontier</b> border agency responsible for regulating import and export of legitimate goods, are increasingly {{faced with the challenge}} of intellectual property rights (IPR) infringement. In addition to national governments, various international organisations have devised guidelines and tools to facilitate and empower Customs agencies in their fight against IPR infringement. In particular, the multilateral Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) articulates a prescription for border enforcement of IPRs in Articles 51 - 60. In this backdrop, this thesis attempts to answer a very fundamental question: What are the implications of ‘Border Measures’, specified under the WTO TRIPS Agreement, for facilitating international trade? To this end, it critically examines the concepts of trade facilitation, TRIPS and IPR protection to highlight the links that connect them and the missing links that need to be established. Obligations to protect IPR under national and international laws are also scrutinised. Research shows that efforts by WTO, World Customs Organization (WCO) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) have been instrumental in this context. While policy planning at the national level should be the first priority, commitment by the advanced economies to support their less developed counterparts through technology transfer (TT) is of paramount importance. The thesis suggests that TRIPS-plus provisions, if implemented arbitrarily by developed countries, have the potential to undermine the interests of countries with resource constraints. In this context, the thesis analyses the effects and implications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreements, and the Revised Kyoto Convention (RKC) for the border protection of IPRs. The thesis investigates the socio-economic impacts of IPR infringement and articulates strategies to be adopted and applied at individual, collective, business and government levels to stop trade and use of IPR infringed goods. Drawing on the analysis of the relevant WTO Articles, scrutiny of various border measures put in place by national governments and international bodies, and current state of play under the Doha Development Round (DDR), the thesis puts forward a set of short and long term policy recommendations for all relevant stakeholders. These inclusively include: (i) strengthening risk management procedures; (ii) cooperation and coordination at national and international levels; (iii) awareness raising initiatives; (iv) establishing advanced technologically driven border enforcement system; (v) empowering Customs with effective administrative authority; (vi) IP related technical capacity building within the Customs and business community; (vii) technology transfer to LDCs from developed countries; and (viii) LDC friendly dispute settlement process under the WTO.
