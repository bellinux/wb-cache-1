50|$|On {{the island}} of Cyprus, the mouflon or agrino became a {{different}} and endemic subspecies known as the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>mouflon</b> (O. o. ophion). The <b>Cyprus</b> <b>mouflon</b> population contains only about 3,000 animals. They are now rare on the islands, but are classified as feral animals by the IUCN. They were later successfully introduced into continental Europe, including Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, central Italy, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Canary Islands, and even some northern European countries such as Denmark, Sweden and Finland.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{molecular}} and biochemical data, which might help to elucidate aspects of evolution of Caprinae globin genes, we characterized the Hb phenotype of Ammotragus lervia (Barbary sheep) and compared it with O. aries (of the A and B-haplotypes), O. g. musimon (of the B and M-haplotypes), O. g. ophion (<b>Cyprus</b> <b>mouflon),</b> and Capra hircus. DNA sequencing analysis on PCR amplified segments was used to define the adult β-globin gene of <b>Cyprus</b> <b>mouflon</b> and Hb B type sheep. The structure of the adult β -globin gene of Barbary sheep was partially determined {{for the first time}} indicating closer relationships with goat than with sheep...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the polymorphism of α-globin chain of hemoglobin amongst caprines, the linked I α and II α globin genes of Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), goat (Capra hircus), European mouflon (Ovis aries musimon), and <b>Cyprus</b> <b>mouflon</b> (Ovis aries ophion) were completely sequenced, including the 5 ′ and 3 ′ untranslated regions. European and Cyprus mouflons, which do not show polymorphic α globin chains, had almost identical α globin genes, whereas Barbary sheep exhibit two different chains encoded by two nonallelic genes. Four different α genes were observed and sequenced in goat, validating previous observations {{of the existence of}} allelic and nonallelic polymorphism. As in other vertebrates, interchromosomal gene conversion appears to be responsible for such polymorphism. Evaluation of nucleotide sequences at the level of molecular evolution of the I α-globin gene family in the caprine taxa suggests a closer relationship between the genus Ammotragus and Capra. Molecular clock estimates suggest sheep-mouflon, goat-aoudad, and ancestor-caprine divergences of 2. 8, 5. 7, and 7. 1 MYBP, respectively...|$|E
