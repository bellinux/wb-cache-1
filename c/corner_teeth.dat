40|$|The {{incisor teeth}} of 176 sheep of six breeds were {{inspected}} {{every two to}} three months for a year to record the shedding of the deciduous teeth and the eruption of the permanent teeth. In all the breeds the permanent central incisors erupted at between 12 and 18 months of age. In 96 per cent of the sheep the permanent middle incisors erupted at between 18 and 26 months; and in 92 per cent the permanent lateral incisors erupted at between 24 and 36 months of age. The permanent <b>corner</b> <b>teeth</b> erupted at between 32 and 44 months in 96 per cent of the sheep. The gingival redness and swelling accompanying the eruption of a permanent tooth disappeared within two months. In 14 cases two pairs of incisors erupted during the year, in 18 cases the incisors erupted asymmetrically, and in 22 cases no incisors erupted. Rotation of one incisor was observed in five sheep and was combined with dental deviation in one. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to the {{analysis}} of friction distribution on radial direction in the precision forging spur gear, the reason that the <b>tooth</b> <b>corner</b> was difficult to fill is revealed. Changing the motion mode of the floating die will change the friction condition between billet and floating die, as well as the filling situation of <b>tooth</b> <b>corner.</b> Finally, the scheme was further validated by DEFORM- 3 D, and the results show that the validity of floating die to <b>tooth</b> <b>corner</b> filling...|$|R
