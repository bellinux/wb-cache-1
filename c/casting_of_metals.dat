In at least some parts of Colchis, the process of urbanization {{seems to have been}} well advanced {{by the end of the}} second millennium BC, centuries before Greek settlement. The Colchian Late Bronze Age (fifteenth to eighth century BC) saw the development of significant skill in the smelting and <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals.</b> Sophisticated farming implements were made, and fertile, well-watered lowlands and a mild climate promoted the growth of progressive agricultural techniques.|$|E

5000|$|We see for {{the first}} time in al-Jazari's work several {{concepts}} important for both design and construction: the lamination of timber to minimize warping, the static balancing of wheels, the use of wooden templates (a kind of pattern), the use of paper models to establish designs, the calibration of orifices, the grinding of the seats and plugs of valves together with emery powder to obtain a watertight fit, and the <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> in closed mold boxes with sand.|$|E

50|$|Patterns {{continue}} to be needed for sand <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals.</b> For the production of gray iron, ductile iron and steel castings, sand casting remains {{the most widely used}} process. For aluminum castings, sand casting represents about 12% of the total tonnage by weight (surpassed only by die casting at 57%, and semi-permanent and permanent mold at 19%; based on 2006 shipments). The exact process and pattern equipment is always determined by the order quantities and the casting design. Sand casting can produce as little as one part, or as many as a million copies.|$|E

40|$|In {{the absence}} of gravity drainage, froth wicking draws excess fluid onto a bubble lattice. Capillary forces only cause fluid transport; a moving front moves stably and without fluid {{fingering}} along a constant velocity bubble-fluid contact line. This percolation of fluid crawling up the lattice shows fluid coverage on lattice borders varies linearly with available surface area (proportional to lattice perimeter) and fluid accelerates through regions or nests of high bubble density (number of bubbles/sq cm). The development of nearly two-dimensional bubble lattices in variable gravity (step function between 0. 01 and 1. 8 times earthly gravity) are examined experimentally and a zeroth-order model for froth wetting is presented, which captures many of the principal observations. Possible applications for bubble lattices include adhesion <b>casting</b> <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> and separation of biological cells, bacteria, and particles...|$|E
