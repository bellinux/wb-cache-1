5|$|In {{his later}} years, and for decades after his death, Poulenc had a reputation, {{particularly}} {{in his native}} country, as a humorous, lightweight composer, and his religious music was often overlooked. During the 21st century more {{attention has been given}} to his serious works, with many new productions of Dialogues des Carmélites and La voix humaine worldwide, and numerous live and recorded performances of his songs and <b>choral</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E

During the 19th and 20th century, many Bulgarian composers created their works {{in the spirit of}} Russian polyphony. Today, Orthodox music is alive and is performed both during church worship services and at concerts by secular choirs and soloists.|$|R
5|$|A central {{topic of}} Leontovych's work is <b>choral</b> <b>music</b> about {{everyday}} life. His music frequently reflect actual actions and events. An {{example of this}} is his shchedrivka “Ой там за горою” (Oh there behind the mountain) in which a tenor initially starts the song with a solo {{and the rest of the}} voices of the choir gradually come in, reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in. Then, a switching of parts begins between different groups of the choir, recreating the clamorous atmosphere of the New Year's Eve.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, {{after his}} {{appearance}} on Britain's Got Talent {{but before the}} release of his first album, Johnston embarked {{on a tour of}} Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The <b>Choral</b> <b>Music</b> of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|Over {{this period}} Vaughan Williams {{composed}} steadily, producing songs, <b>choral</b> <b>music,</b> chamber works and orchestral pieces, gradually finding {{the beginnings of}} his mature style. His compositions included the tone poem In the Fen Country (1904) and the Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1 (1906). He remained unsatisfied with his technique as a composer. After unsuccessfully seeking lessons from Sir Edward Elgar, he contemplated studying with Vincent d'Indy in Paris. Instead, he was introduced by the critic and musicologist M.D.Calvocoressi to Maurice Ravel, a more modernist, less dogmatic musician than d'Indy.|$|E

5|$|Smetana's early {{songs are}} {{settings}} of German poems for single voice. Apart from his 1848 Song of Freedom, {{he did not}} begin to write pieces for a full choir until after his Gothenburg sojourn, when he composed numerous works for the Hlahol choral society, mostly for unaccompanied male voices. Smetana's <b>choral</b> <b>music</b> is generally nationalistic in character, ranging in scale from the short Ceremonial Chorus written {{after the death of}} the composer's revolutionary friend Havlíček, to the setting of Song of the Sea, a substantial work with the character of a choral drama.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, choral {{associations}} became common in Maryland, and Baltimore, {{buoyed by the}} immigration of numerous Germans. These groups were formed {{for the purpose of}} instruction in <b>choral</b> <b>music,</b> eventually performing oratorios. The popularity of these choral associations helped to garner support among the local population for putting music education in the city's public schools. The Baltimore Oratorio Society, the Liederkranz and the Germania Männerchor were {{the most important of these}} associations, and their traditions were maintained into the 20th century by organizations like the Bach Choir, Choral Arts Society, Concert Artists of Baltimore, Handel Society and the Baltimore Symphony Chorus.|$|E

5|$|Reger, who {{was born}} in Bavaria in 1873 and studied at the Wiesbaden Conservatory, worked as a concert pianist and composer. His work focused first on chamber music, Lied and <b>choral</b> <b>music.</b> After his studies he {{returned}} to his parental home in 1898 and concentrated on works for organ, continuing the tradition of Johann Sebastian Bach. Raised Catholic, he was still inspired by Lutheran hymns, writing chorale fantasias such as Zwei Choralphantasien, Op. 40, in 1899. He moved to Munich in 1901 and married in 1902 Elsa vonBercken, a divorced Protestant. In 1907, Reger was appointed professor at the Royal Conservatory in Leipzig. A year later he began the composition.|$|E
5|$|The {{music played}} at coronations has been {{primarily}} classical and religiously inspired. Much of the <b>choral</b> <b>music</b> uses texts from the Bible {{which have been}} used at coronations since King Edgar's coronation at Bath in 973 and are known as coronation anthems. In the coronations following the Reformation, court musicians, often the Master of the King's Music, were commissioned to compose new settings for the traditional texts. The most frequently used piece is Zadok the Priest by George Frideric Handel; one of four anthems commissioned from him for GeorgeII's coronation in 1727. It has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any other piece. Previous settings of the same text were composed by Henry Lawes for the 1661 coronation of CharlesII and Thomas Tomkins for CharlesI in 1621.|$|E
5|$|Zimmer wrote {{several hours}} of music, and an {{abundance}} of different themes, before Malick started to shoot the film. The director played the music on the set, while filming, to get himself, {{and the rest of}} the crew and actors in the right frame of mind. The official soundtrack features tracks that were not used on the film and some tracks from the film are not found on the CD. The film features several pieces of Melanesian <b>choral</b> <b>music</b> sung by the Choir of All Saints in Honiara, only one of which is featured on the soundtrack. However, another soundtrack was released containing several tracks from the Choir, which has since gone out of circulation.|$|E

5|$|Danny Baranowsky, the game's {{composer}} and who previously worked with McMillen on Super Meat Boy, was involved early {{on with the}} project shortly {{after the completion of}} the first prototype. McMillen and Baranowsky worked back and forth, with McMillen providing artwork from the game and allowing Baranowsky to develop the musical themes based on that; this would often lead to McMillen creating more art to support the music as it progressed. Baranowsky had been drawn to The Binding of Isaac as though the game puts forth a dark tone, he stated it had rather silly undertones underneath and such that one could not take it too seriously. Some of the songs were inspired by classical <b>choral</b> <b>music</b> but modified to fit the theme of the game. Other works were inspired by boss fight songs composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the Final Fantasy series. Baranowsky also had additional time after finishing the main songs for the game to craft short additional tracks that were used for special rooms like shops and secret areas.|$|E
5|$|The School for Creative and Performing Arts {{opened in}} August 1973, {{as the only}} grade four through six school for the {{performing}} arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program. The curriculum included art, instrumental music, <b>choral</b> <b>music,</b> dance and drama, and was not organized strictly by grade, but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed. Murray explained: Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes. Teaching will often be done in teams. Art students will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply the music. They work together regardless of age. In reading classes they will read according to their own individual levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's wildest dreams, might stumble on fifth level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Delius did not confine himself to purely orchestral works; he {{produced}} his final opera, Fennimore and Gerda (1908–10), like A Village Romeo and Juliet written in tableau form, {{but in his}} mature style. His choral works of the period, notably An Arabesque (1911) and A Song of the High Hills (1911) {{are among the most}} radical of Delius's writings in their juxtapositions of unrelated chords. The latter work, entirely wordless, contains some of the most difficult <b>choral</b> <b>music</b> in existence, according to Heseltine. After 1915, Delius turned his attention to traditional sonata, chamber and concerto forms, which he had largely left alone since his apprentice days. Of these pieces Payne highlights two: the Violin Concerto (1916), as an example of how, writing in unfamiliar genres, Delius remained stylistically true to himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917, which, lacking the familiarity of an orchestral palate, becomes a melodic triumph. Cardus's verdict, however, is that Delius's chamber and concerto works are largely failures. After 1917, according to Payne, there was a general deterioration in {{the quantity and quality of}} Delius's output as illness took hold, although Payne exempts the incidental music to Hassan (1920–23) from condemnation, believing it to contain some of Delius's best work.|$|E
