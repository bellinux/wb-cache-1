5000|$|<b>Cardiopulmonary</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>machines</b> were {{essential}} {{to the development of}} deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) in humans. [...] By 1959, it was known from the animal experiments of Bigelow, Andjus and Smith, Gollan, Lewis's colleague, Niazi, and others that temperatures near 0°C could be survived by mammals, [...] and that colder temperature permitted the brain to survive longer circulatory arrest times, even beyond one hour. Humans had survived cooling to 9°C, and circulatory arrest of 45 minutes, using external cooling only. However, reaching such low temperatures by external cooling was difficult and hazardous. At temperatures below 24°C, the human heart is prone to fibrillation and stopping. This can begin circulatory arrest before the brain has reached a safe temperature. <b>Cardiopulmonary</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>machines</b> allow blood circulation and cooling to continue below the temperature at which the heart stops working. By cooling blood directly, <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>bypass</b> also cools people faster than surface cooling, even if the heart is not functioning.|$|R

5000|$|Pediatric {{cardiovascular}} {{surgery is}} surgery {{of the heart}} of children.The first operations to repair heart defects in children were performed by Clarence Crafoord in Sweden when he repaired {{coarctation of the aorta}} in a 12-year-old boy. The first attempts to palliate congenital heart disease were performed by Alfred Blalock with the assistance of William Longmire, Denton Cooley, and Blalock's experienced technician, Vivien Thomas in 1944 at Johns Hopkins Hospital. [...] Techniques for repair of congenital heart defects without the use of a bypass machine were developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Among them was an open repair of an atrial septal defect using hypothermia, inflow occlusion and direct vision in a 5-year old child performed in 1952 by Lewis and Tauffe. C. Walter Lillihei used cross-circulation between a boy and his father to maintain perfusion while performing a direct repair of a ventricular septal defect in a 4 year old child in 1954. He continued to use cross-circulation and performed the first corrections of tetratology of Fallot and presented those results in 1955 at the American Surgical Association.

We monitored and compared the flow rates provided by the <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>machine</b> (roller pump) with estimates derived from the empirical physiological formulae embedded in the HeartSmart® monitor in 32 patients. Cardiac index values were compared at the start of cardiopulmonary bypass, during re-warming, {{and at the end of}} cardiopulmonary bypass. Results: A total of 256 paired sets of measurements were suitable for comparison. The mean of the differences or bias (95 % limits of agreement) was 0. 09 l/min/m 2 and the limits of agreement – 0. 86 to 1. 05 l/min/m 2 . The mean difference of the sets of 256 measurements was 585. 5 l/min/m for the pump and 575. 0 l/min/m 2 for the empirical physiological formulae—a difference of 5 % l/min/m 2 . The range of flow rates for the pump was 1. 2 to 2. 85 l/min/m 2 ; for the empirical physiological formulae, the range was 1. 2 to 3. 0 l/min/m 2 . Conclusion: The cardiac index estimates derived from the empirical physiological formulae in the HeartSmart® software are in good agreement with pump cardiac output rates. These results suggest that HeartSmart® measurements are sufficiently accurate for assessing hemodynamic variables in many groups of patients...|$|E

Off pump CABG is relatively a newer procedure to on-pump CABG and does not require the use of the <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>machine.</b> On pump CABG is the more traditional method of performing bypass surgery. However its resultant inflammatory effects cause renal dysfunction, gastrointestinal distress and cardiac abnormalities which have forced the surgeons to look for alternatives to the procedure. An extensive literature search revealed that on pump CABG causes better revascularization as compared to off pump CABG while off pump CABG has a much lower post operative morbidity and mortality especially in high risk patients.

In this article, the authors introduce a whole-body PMCTA approach involving left ventricle cardiac puncture. This procedure {{was performed in}} 9 males and 3 females. PMCT was performed first. Then a biopsy core needle was used for a percutaneous puncture into the left ventricle through the intercostal area under CT guidance. 1000 mL of contrast media (diatrizoate meglumine and normal saline [0. 9 %] at 1 : 2 ratio) was injected {{at a rate of}} 50 mL/ 8 s, followed by CT scan. Visualization of systemic arteries was achieved in 11 cases, while only partial visualization was achieved in 1 case, which may have been related to incomplete thawing of the cadaver. PMCTA results revealed no vascular diseases and abnormalities in 10 victims. Among the 10 victims, 4 post-scan autopsies were performed and found no vascular abnormalities, consistent with the PMCTA results. Autopsy of the other 6 victims were refused by the relatives. PMCTA revealed signs of internal carotid artery aneurysm inside the sphenoid sinus in one victim, which was confirmed by autopsy. PMCTA results of another victim showed signs of stenosis and blockage of the distal part of the right vertebral artery and basilar artery. Thromboembolism of those arteries was found during autopsy. Compared with other existing PMCTA methods for examination of vascular injuries and diseases, this technique involves simple procedures, is less time consuming, has lower associated costs, does not require specialized equipment, provides adequate imaging quality, and is suitable for centres not equipped with <b>cardiopulmonary</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>machines</b> or other specialized equipment...|$|R

Ninety-five patients from Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, and Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta, who had open heart surgery within the period of December 2011 to May 2012 were enrolled in this study.
