Here we present CaCO 3 particle volume distribution data from the coccolith size-fraction of a rapidly accumulating North Atlantic sediment core. These data appear to indicate that coccoliths produced by the larger coccolithophore species present at this location increase in mass in parallel with anthropogenic CO 2 release. This finding has significant implications for the realistic representation of an assemblage-wide coccolithophore CO 2 -calcification response in numerical models. Citation: Halloran, P. R. et al.

Phases generated from very partial molecular-replacement models (if generated carefully) can be used to reliably locate heavy-atom sites, even if the signal is not sufficiently strong to allow robust finding of the sites using Patterson interpretation or direct methods. Additional advantages are that using molecular-replacement phases to define the heavy-atom substructure avoids the need for subsequent hand determination and/or origin-choice reconciliation and that the partial model can be used to aid the mask determination during solvent flattening. Two case studies are presented in which it was only by combining experimental and molecular-replacement phasing approaches that the crystal structures could be determined.

40|$|The {{effect of}} wind speed on aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 0. 55 μm over remote ocean regions is investigated. Remote ocean regions {{are defined by}} the {{combination}} of AOD from satellite observation and wind direction from ECMWF. According to our definition, many ocean regions cannot be taken as remote ocean regions due to long-range transportation of aerosol from continents. Highly correlated linear relationships are found in remote ocean regions with a wind speed range of 0 - 20 ms⁻¹. The enhancement of AOD at high wind speed is explained as the increase of sea salt aerosol production. Citation: Huang, H., Thomas, G. E. & Grainger, R. G. (2010).

During the day, photolysis of N₂O₅ in the stratosphere contributes to nitrogen-catalysed ozone destruction. However, at night concentrations of N₂O₅ increase, temporarily sequestering reactive NOₓ(NO and NO₂) in a natural cycle which regulates the majority of stratospheric ozone. In this paper, the {{reaction rate}} controlling the formation of N₂O₅ is determined from this instrument for the first time.

As {{a basis for the}} work, existing literature was reviewed and the gaps in existing knowledge highlighted. Environmental assessment methods were identified as a way to incentivise design for deconstruction. An analysis of LEED demonstrated minimal achievement of <b>reuse</b> <b>credits,</b> likely due to limited availability of reused materials. The supply chain can be developed in the future through the design for deconstruction of all new buildings. Quantifying the environmental benefits of design for deconstruction was underlined as a key strategy to encourage designers to consider the incorporation of design for deconstruction. A methodology was developed to account for designed-in future reuse at the initial design stage. This is based on a PAS 2050 methodology (2008) which shares the environmental impact of an element over the number of predicted lives. In the course of this work it has been assumed that the typical building has a fifty year life span, a conservative estimate. Studies in this thesis limit analysis to a hundred year period, giving a possible two lives for the majority of elements.

40|$|Large cloud {{condensation}} nuclei (CCN) (e. g., aged {{dust particles}} and seasalt) cannot attain their equilibrium size during the typical timescale of cloud droplet activation. Cloud activation parameterizations applied to aerosol {{with a large}} fraction of large CCN often do not account for this limitation adequately and can give biased predictions of cloud droplet number concentrations (CDNC). Here we present a simple approach {{to address this problem}} that can easily be incorporated into cloud activation parameterizations. This method is demonstrated with activation parameterizations based on the "population splitting" concept of Nenes and Seinfeld (2003); it is shown that accounting for large CCN effects eliminates a positive bias in CDNC where the aerosol dry geometric diameter is greater than 0. 5 μm. The method proposed here can also be extended to include the water vapour depletion from pre-existing droplets and ice crystals in global and regional atmospheric models.

40|$|Analysing {{satellite}} datasets {{over large}} regions may introduce spurious relationships between aerosol and cloud properties due to spatial variations in aerosol type, cloud regime and synoptic regime climatologies. Using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, we calculate relationships between aerosol optical depth Ta, derived liquid cloud droplet effective number concentration Ne and liquid cloud droplet effective radius re at different spatial scales. Generally, positive values of dlnNe/dlnTa are found for ocean regions, whilst negative values occur for many land regions. The {{spatial distribution of}} dlnNe/dlnTa shows approximately the opposite pattern, with generally positive values for land regions and negative values for ocean regions. We find that for region sizes larger than 4 °x 4 °, spurious spatial variations in retrieved cloud and aerosol properties can introduce widespread significant errors to calculations of dlnNe/dlnTa and dlre/dlnTa. For regions {{on the scale of}} 60 °x 60 °, these methodological errors may lead to an overestimate in global cloud albedo effect radiative forcing of order 80 %. Citation: Grandey, B. S. & Stier, P.

ORAC is an optimal estimation retrieval scheme for deriving cloud and aerosol properties from measurements made by imaging satellite radiometers and, when applied to cloud free radiances, provides estimates of aerosol optical depth at a wavelength of 550 nm, aerosol effective radius and surface reflectance at 550 nm.

40|$|QUAGMIRE is a quasi-geostrophic {{numerical}} model for performing fast, high-resolution simulations of multi-layer rotating annulus laboratory experiments on a desktop personal computer. The model uses a hybrid finite-difference/spectral approach to numerically integrate the coupled nonlinear partial differential {{equations of motion}} in cylindrical geometry in each layer. Version 1. 3 implements the special case of two fluid layers of equal resting depths. The flow is forced either by a differentially rotating lid, or by relaxation to specified streamfunction or potential vorticity fields, or both. Dissipation is achieved through Ekman layer pumping and suction at the horizontal boundaries, including the internal interface. The effects of weak interfacial tension are included, {{as well as the}} linear topographic beta-effect and the quadratic centripetal beta-effect. Stochastic forcing may optionally be activated, to represent approximately the effects of random unresolved features. A leapfrog time stepping scheme is used, with a Robert filter. Flows simulated by the model agree well with those observed in the corresponding laboratory experiments. Citation: Williams, P. D. et al. (2008).

40|$|Although a {{division}} of the Phanerozoic climatic modes of the Earth into "greenhouse" and "icehouse" phases is widely accepted, whether or not polar ice developed during the relatively warm Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods is still under debate. In particular, there is a range of isotopic and biotic evidence that favours the concept of discrete "cold snaps", marked particularly by migration of certain biota towards lower latitudes. Extension of the use of the palaeotemperature proxy TEX 86 back to the middle Jurassic indicates that relatively warm sea-surface conditions (26 - 30 °C) existed from this interval (~ 160 Ma) to the Early Cretaceous (~ 115 Ma) in the Southern Ocean. The Jurassic and Cretaceous "cold snaps" represent falls of only a few degrees. Belemnite δ 18 O data gives palaeotemperatures that are consistently lower by ~ 14 °C than does TEX 86 and these molluscs likely record conditions below the thermocline. Such long-term warm climatic conditions would only be compatible with the existence of continental ice and if appreciable areas of high altitude existed on Antarctica, and/or in other polar regions, during the Mesozoic Era.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{describe}} an objective classification scheme for extreme UK daily precipitation {{to be used in}} flood risk analysis applications. We create a simplified representation of the spatial layout of extreme events based on a new digital archive of UK rainfall. This simplification allows a Bayesian clustering algorithm to compress these representations down to eight prototypical patterns of extreme falls. These patterns are then verified against a five-class, manual, subjective typing scheme, produced independently using known meteorological mechanisms, isohyetal maps and additional descriptive text from the archive. Compared against the manual scheme, the new objective scheme can reproduce the known meteorological conditions, both in terms of spatial layout and seasonal timing, and is shown to be of hydrological relevance when matched to several notable flooding events in the past century. Furthermore, it is computationally simple and straightforward to apply in classifying future extreme rainfall events. We discuss the practical use of this new typing scheme in flood simulations and climate change applications. Citation: Little, M. A., Rodda, H. J. E. & McSharry, P. E. (2008).

40|$|Investigation of {{radiation}} damage in protein crystals has progressed in several directions {{over the past}} couple of years. There have been improvements in the basic procedures such as calibration of the incident X-ray intensity and calculation of the dose likely to be deposited in a crystal of known size and composition with this intensity. There has been increased emphasis on using additional techniques such as optical, Raman or X-ray spectroscopy to complement X-ray diffraction. Apparent discrepancies between the results of different techniques can be explained by the fact that they are sensitive to different length scales or to changes in the electronic state rather than to movement of atoms. Investigations have been carried out at room temperature as well as cryo-temperatures and, in both cases, with the introduction of potential scavenger molecules. These and other studies are leading to an overall description of the changes which can occur when a protein crystal is irradiated with X-rays at both cryo- and room temperatures. Results from crystallographic and spectroscopic radiation-damage experiments can be reconciled with other studies in the field {{of radiation}} physics and chemistry. Citation: Garman, E.

Concomitant measurements include temperature, pressure, relative humidity and the aerosol size distribution. The refractive indices {{of the sea}} salt aerosol have been determined using a simple harmonic oscillator band model (Thomas et al., 2004) for aerosol with relative humidities at eight different values between 0. 4 % to 86 %. The resulting refractive index spectra show significant discrepancies when compared to existing sea salt refractive indices calculated using volume mixing rules (Shettle and Fenn, 1979). Specifically, an additional band {{is found in the}} refractive indices of dry sea salt aerosol and the new data shows increased values of refractive index at almost all wavelengths. This implies that the volume mixing rules, currently used to calculate the refractive indices of wet sea salt aerosols, are inadequate. Furthermore, the existing data for the real and imaginary parts of the refractive indices of dry sea salt aerosol are found not to display the Kramers-Kronig relationship. This implies that the original data used for the volume mixing calculations is also inaccurate. Citation: Irshad, R. et al. (2009).

40|$|The Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) onboard ENVISAT has the {{potential}} to be particularly useful for studying high, thin clouds, which have been difficult to observe in the past. This paper details the development, implementation and testing of an optimal-estimation-type retrieval for three macrophysical cloud parameters (cloud top height, cloud top temperature and cloud extinction coefficient) from infrared spectra measured by MIPAS. A preliminary estimation of a parameterisation of the optical and geometrical filling of the measurement field-of-view by cloud is employed as the first step of the retrieval process to improve the choice of a priori for the macrophysical parameters themselves. Preliminary application to single-scattering simulations indicates that the retrieval error stemming from uncertainties introduced by noise and by a priori variances in the retrieval process itself is small - although it should be noted that these retrieval errors do not include the significant errors stemming from the assumption of homogeneity and the non-scattering nature of the forward model. Such errors are preliminarily and qualitatively assessed here, and are likely to be the dominant error sources. The retrieval converges for 99 % of input cases, although sometimes fails to converge for vetically-thin (This algorithm has been adopted by the European Space Agency's "MIPclouds" project.

40|$|This is {{the first}} article of a series {{presenting}} {{a detailed analysis of}} bromine chemistry simulated with the atmospheric chemistry general circulation model ECHAM 5 /MESSy. Release from sea salt is an important bromine source, hence the model explicitly calculates aerosol chemistry and phase partitioning for coarse mode aerosol particles. Many processes including chemical reaction rates are influenced by the particle size distribution, and aerosol associated water strongly affects the aerosol pH. Knowledge of the aerosol pH is important as it determines the aerosol chemistry, e. g., the efficiency of sulphur oxidation and bromine release. Here, we focus on the simulated sea salt aerosol size distribution and the coarse mode aerosol pH. A comparison with available field data shows that the simulated aerosol distributions agree reasonably well within the range of measurements. In spite of the small number of aerosol pH measurements and the uncertainty in its experimental determination, the simulated aerosol pH compares well with the observations. The aerosol pH ranges from alkaline aerosol in areas of strong production down to pH values of 1 over regions of medium sea salt production and high levels of gas phase acids, mostly polluted regions over the oceans in the northern hemisphere.

40|$|We {{present results}} from a study of canopy-atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide from 2007 to 2009 above a site in Wytham Woods, an ancient {{temperate}} broadleaved deciduous forest in southern England. Gap-filled Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) data were partitioned into Gross Primary Productivity (GP) and ecosystem respiration (Rₑ) and analysed on daily, monthly and annual timescales. Over the continous 24 month study period annual GPP was estimated at 21. 1 MgCha⁻¹yr⁻¹ and Rₑ at 19. 8 MgCha⁻¹yr⁻¹; Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) was 1. 2 MgCha⁻¹yr⁻¹. These estimates are very consistent with independent bottom-up estimates derived from Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and flux chamber measurements in 2008 (GPP = 20. 3 ± 1. 0 MgCha⁻¹yr⁻¹, Rₑ = 18. 9 ± 1. 7 MgCha⁻¹yr⁻¹, biomass increment = ~ 1. 4 MgCha⁻¹yr⁻¹). Interannual variability of seasonal NEP was predominantly driven by changes in ecosystem respiration, whereas GPP remained similar for equivalent months in different years. Although solar radiation was the largest influence on daytime CO₂ fluxes (R² = 0. 53 for the summer months), interannual variation in Rₑ appeared {{to be driven by}} temperature. Our findings suggest that this ancient woodland site is currently a substantial sink for carbon, resulting from continued growth that is probably a legacy of past management practices abandoned over 40 years ago. Our GPP and Rₑ values are generally higher than other broadleaved temperate deciduous woodlands and may represent the influence of the UK's maritime climate, or the particular species composition of this site. The carbon sink value of Wytham Woods supports the protection and management of temperate deciduous woodlands (including those managed for conservation rather than silvicultural objectives) as a strategy to mitigate atmospheric carbon dioxide increases.

40|$|The {{comparison}} of satellite and model aerosol optical depth (AOD) fields provides useful {{information on the}} strengths and weaknesses of both. However, the sampling of satellite and models is very different and some subjective decisions about data selection and aggregation must be made in order to perform such comparisons. This work examines some implications of these decisions, using GlobAerosol AOD retrievals at 550 nm from Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) measurements, and aerosol fields from the GEOS-Chem chemistry transport model. It is recommended to sample the model only where the satellite flies over on a particular day; neglecting this can cause regional differences in model AOD of up to 0. 1 on monthly and annual timescales. The comparison is observed to depend strongly upon thresholds for sparsity of satellite retrievals in the model grid cells. Requiring at least 25 % coverage of the model grid cell by satellite data decreases the observed difference between hte two by approximately half over land. The impact over ocean is smaller. In both model and satellite datasets, there is an anticorrelation between the proportion ρ of a model grid cell covered by satellite retrievals and the AOD. This is attributed to small ρ typically occuring due to high cloud cover and lower AODs being found in large clear-sky regions. Daily median AATSR AODs were found to be closer to GEOS-Chem AODs than daily means (with the root mean squared difference being approximately 0. 05 smaller). This is due to the decreased sensitivity of medians to outliers such as cloud-contaminated retrievals, or aerosol point sources not included in the model. Citation: Sayer, A. M. et al. (2010).

40|$|Wet {{deposition}} {{processes are}} highly efficient in {{the removal of}} aerosols from the atmosphere, and thus strongly influence global aerosol concentrations, and clouds, and their respective radiative forcings. In this study, physically detailed size-dependent below-cloud scavenging parameterizations for rain and snow are implemented in the ECHAM 5 -HAM global aerosol-climate model. Previously, below-cloud scavenging by rain in the ECHAM 5 -HAM was simply {{a function of the}} aerosol mode, and then scaled by the rainfall rate. The below-cloud scavenging by snow was a function of the snowfall rate alone. The global mean aerosol optical depth, and sea salt burden are sensitive to the below-cloud scavenging coefficients, with reductions near to 15 % when the more vigorous size-dependent below-cloud scavenging by rain and snow is implemented. The inclusion of a prognostic rain scheme significantly reduces the fractional importance of below-cloud scavenging since there is higher evaporation in the lower tropospher, increasing the global mean sea salt burden by almost 15 %. Thermophoretic effects are show to produce increases in the global and annual mean below-cloud number removal of Aitken size particles of near to 15 %, but very small increases (near 1 %) in the global mean below-cloud mass scavenging of ultra-fine particles by rain do not cause any significant changes to the global mean aerosol mass or number burdens, despite a change in the below-cloud number removal rate for nucleation mode particles by near to 10 %. For nucleation mode particles, changes to the assumptions about the below-cloud scavenging by snow produce a greater change in the number removal rate, in excess of one order of magnitude. Closer agreement with different observations is found when the more physically detailed below-cloud scavenging parameterization is employed in the ECHAM 5 -HAM model. Citation: Croft, B. et al.

40|$|Executive Summary: Five {{facilitated}} Statewide Water Roundtables {{were held}} in Bend, Newport, Ontario, Medford, and Salem during September and October 2008; 301 people attended. Since attendees were self-selected, and some attended more than one Roundtable, {{they are not a}} representative cross-section of Oregonians. The attendees responded to eight questions designed to identify their interests and the source of their water. They were also asked which of the following five factors – quantity, quality, economic, ecological, social - they valued most about Oregon and its water. In each region, the majority of the stakeholders are not optimistic about either current or future water supplies, either disagreeing or disagreeing strongly with these statements: 1) in 2008 Oregonians have enough water to cover their needs, including wildlife; 2) same question, but in Year 2028. Attendees identified issues/opportunities/threats (issues) and outcomes/expectations/payoffs (outcomes), then prioritized the issues and identified potential solutions, actions to be taken in the short term and long term, existing examples, and groups responsible for action or implementation. Many issues were the same from Roundtable to Roundtable but certain ones were more evident in particular locations, e. g., water rights and protection of existing water rights (Ontario, Bend); and invasive species (Newport). The participants were knowledgeable about their water supply; only three of 301 attendees could not identify the source of their water. The solutions offered by participants reflected this high degree of knowledge. Over 200 issues were identified at the five Roundtables. The Roundtables were designed to encourage brainstorming so characterizing the issues cannot be done scientifically. Representative issues included: • Funding for water and wastewater infrastructure and management • Integrated long range planning and management at the basin level within a statewide framework • Protection of existing water rights and uses • Water quality, especially non-point pollution, micro-contaminants and the impact of urbanization • Water-land use planning integration • Climate change impacts • Wetland, floodplain and instream flow restoration • Interstate water allocation/management for surface and groundwater Key messages heard at all sessions were that: • One size does not fit all; regions vary greatly and regional differences need to be recognized • Public information and education about water use and management is needed • Need for integrated water management and implementation Potential solutions: • Maximize available funds through agency coordination and streamlining of funding sources • Water conservation tax credits, like energy tax <b>credits</b> • Water <b>reuse</b> and recycling • Water markets, pricing and incentives • Water storage and conservation • Measuring water flows and uses systematically • Local integrated water planning • Interstate compact(s...|$|R
40|$|We examine volume mixing ratios (vmr) {{retrieved}} from limb emission spectra recorded with the Michelson Inferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS). In level 2 (L 2) data products {{of three different}} retrieval processors, which perform one dimensional (1 -D) retrievals, we find significant differences between species' profiles from ascending and descending orbit parts. The relative differences vary systematically with time of the year, latitude, and altitude. In the lower stratosphere their monthly means can reach maxima of 20 % for CFC- 11, CFC- 12, HNO₃, H₂O, 10 % for CH₄ and N₂O. Relative differences between monthly means of 1 -D retrieval results and of the true atmospheric state {{can be expected to}} reach half of these percentage values, while relative differences in single vmr profiles might well exceed those numbers. Often there are no physical or chemical reasons for these differences, so they are an indicator for a problem in the data processing. The differences are generally largest at locations where the meridional temperature gradient of the atmosphere is strong. On the contrary, when performing the retrieval with a tomographic two dimensional (2 -D) retrieval, L 2 products generally do not show these differences. This implies that inhomogeneities in the temperature field, and possibly in the species' fields, which are accounted for in the 2 -D algorithm and not in standard 1 -D processors, may cause significant deviations in the results. Inclusion of an externally given adequate temperature gradient in the forward model of a 1 -D processor helps to reduce the observed differences. However, only the full tomographic approach is suitable to resolve the horizontal inhomogeneities. Implications {{for the use of the}} 1 -D data, e. g. for validation, are discussed. The dependence of the ascending/descending differences on the observation strategy suggests that this problem is to be expected to affect in general 1 -D retrievals of infrared limb sounders, if the line of sight of the instrument has a significant component in the direction of the horizontal temperature variation.
