5000|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, the West German government introduced a route-specific subsidy of up to 20% for all internal German scheduled air services from and to West Berlin to help the airlines cope with the resulting falloff in traffic and maintain an economically viable operation on these [...] routes. These came into effect on 1 March 1962 for all tickets sold in Germany, including Berlin. (To qualify for the subsidised rate under this system, the passenger was required to purchase a round-trip ticket for a scheduled internal German flight from/to West Berlin in Germany.

Dinner was rapidly consumed; Joan enlightened, comforted, and kissed; the dearest of apple-faced cousins hugged; the kindest of apple-faced cousins' fathers subjected to the same process; and I mounted the ambulance, baggage-wagon, or anything you please but hack, and drove away, too tired to feel excited, sorry, or glad.|$|R

40|$|Stainless steel coupons are {{frequently}} used in biofilm {{studies in the}} laboratory, as this material is commonly used in the food industry. The <b>coupons</b> are <b>attached</b> to different surfaces to create a “natural” biofilm to be studied further in laboratory trials. However, little {{has been done to}} investigate how well the microbiota on such coupons represents the surrounding environment. The microbiota on sink wall surfaces and on new stainless steel <b>coupons</b> <b>attached</b> to the sink wall for 3 months in 8 domestic kitchen sinks was investigated by next-generation sequencing (MiSeq) of the 16 S rRNA gene derived from DNA and RNA (cDNA), and by plating and identification of colonies. The mean number of colony-forming units was about 10 -fold higher for coupons than sink surfaces, and more variation in bacterial counts between kitchens was seen on sink surfaces than coupons. The microbiota in the majority of biofilms was dominated by Moraxellaceae (genus Moraxella/Enhydrobacter) and Micrococcaceae (genus Kocuria). The results demonstrated that the variation in the microbiota was mainly due to differences between kitchens (38. 2 %), followed by the different nucleic acid template (DNA vs RNA) (10. 8 %), and that only 5. 1 % of the variation was a result of differences between coupons and sink surfaces. The microbiota variation between sink surfaces and coupons was smaller for samples based on their RNA than on their DNA. Overall, our results suggest that new stainless steel coupons are suited to model the dominating part of the natural microbiota of the surrounding environment and, furthermore, are suitable for different downstream studies...|$|R
50|$|With this setup, Ryan {{returned}} to St. Louis, and opened an {{office for the}} John J. Ryan Turf Investment Company, and began offering shares of stock {{to the public at}} $5.00 per share. The shares came with five, $1.00 <b>coupons</b> <b>attached,</b> entitling the shareholder to cash in one coupon one week at a time. Investors were told that the company's capital was to be used to bet on the outcome of horse races at the Newport track selected by Ryan. Because of the lack of public transport there was no substantial public attendance at the races. It appears reasonably clear that Ryan, through his control of the track operations, controlled the outcome of the races. Whether or not the company took paper profits or losses on betting the horses, Ryan's game was a pyramid scheme. By paying large sums for newspaper advertisements, and mailing promotional literature, he attracted capital and used part of it to pay for the redemption of the coupons from shares sold earlier, skimming, in the process, huge sums for himself.|$|R

40|$|Currently {{there are}} no {{standards}} for testing efficacy of medical device cleaners. With fears of prion transmission, residual protein on medical devices needs to be minimised. A bioreactor model was used to grow Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm on polytetrafluoroethylene coupons. The biofilm was subjected to various cleaners and residual biofilm was detected either by Crystal Violet assay (CrV) or a commercially available protein assay (PA) following hydrolysis of the biofilm. Percentage reduction of biofilm was compared with untreated controls in three independent tests. There {{was no significant difference}} in percentage biofilm reduction irrespective of whether the CrV or PA was used to detect residual biofilm. Processing of <b>coupons</b> <b>attached</b> to the bioreactor rod and position of coupon within the rod had no significant effect on cleaning efficiency or detection of residual biofilm. Both within-run and between-run variation was very low for good cleaners such as 10 g/L NaOH, Zen, and 3 M Rapid Multi-Enzyme Cleaner (RMEC) 70500 but was higher for poor cleaners such as Tween 20 which removed less than 20 % of the biofilm. Confocal microscopy and electron microscopy provided visual confirmation of the assay results. We propose that this method is suitable as a test method for evaluating the efficacy of surgical instrument cleaners in removing biofilm, as both within-run and between-run variation was low, detection of residual biofilm can be done using either CrV or PA, and the apparatus is easy to use, cheap and readily available. 8 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|In recent years, metal {{boxes of}} {{fraudulent}} Federal Reserve Notes in astronomically high denominations (often in $100 million, $500 million, or $1 billion) and often with <b>coupons</b> <b>attached</b> {{have turned up}} in various eastern countries such as the Philippines or Malaysia. In many cases, the notes are claimed {{to be part of}} a lost trove of secretly issued Federal Reserve Notes, and are special or not known to the public due to secrecy. Also, the bonds are sometimes treated to make them look old by getting them wet and moldy. However, the Federal Reserve has never issued notes in such denominations, and has issued warnings against them on its website. Additionally, there are several errors in the bonds as well as the metal boxes, many of them anachronistic. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York writes thatThe Federal Reserve is aware of several scams involving high denomination Federal Reserve notes and bonds, often in denominations of 100 million or 500 million dollars, dating back to the 1930s, usually 1934.

40|$|Multipurpose senior {{centers are}} {{expanding}} their services {{to meet the}} demands of a growing population. Unfortunately, federal agencies have not matched this expansion with monetary support. Many senior centers hold fund-raisers to supplement their budgets, but the impact of these projects is rarely evaluated. This study assessed the effectiveness of a public posting strategy designed to increase donations to an ongoing fund-raiser for a multipurpose senior center. The fund-raiser, “Coupons for Caring,” consisted of senior volunteers clipping grocery coupons from newspapers, sorting them, and attaching them to their respective products in local grocery stores. Grocery store customers were given the option of donating the coupons to the senior center or redeeming them when they purchased the products to which the <b>coupons</b> were <b>attached.</b> In the experimental condition, signs were posted that included visual and written instructions, feedback on the value of coupons donated by customers the previous week, and feedback on the overall amount of money donated to the senior center.

The percentage of coupons donated to the senior center increased at each store after the signs were posted...|$|R
40|$|Exploration {{of ocean}} depths {{has opened up}} new avenues of {{interest}} to scientists and technologists. In the light of efforts being focussed on offshore drilling, ocean floor mining, etc., there is need {{for the development of}} new materials suited for this purpose; Fundamental to the development of such systems is the knowledge of the behaviour of component materials in the deep-sea environment. Several materials used in the fabrication of deep-sea systems deteriorate in service in an unexpected manner unlike their predicted behaviour established in laboratory saline solutions. In deep waters the deterioration is due to the cumulative effect of the environmental conditions of hydrostatic pressure, temperature, pH, dissolved salinity, sea water current, etc. A study has been initiated to study the behaviour of several constructional materials, inclusive of mild steel cupro-nickel, aluminium and its alloys, austempered ductile iron and titanium, in deep seawater environment. Specimen <b>coupons</b> were <b>attached</b> to deep sea moorings at depths ranging from 500 - 1000 m for a duration of upto 95 days. Weight loss data from the specimens recovered after exposure yielded corrosion rates. Surface morphology of the exposed specimens was studied in the scanning electron microscope. Results obtained with the tested materials curd the general performance in deep sea environment are discussed in. this paper. Environmental factors encountered in deep water and their effect on material behaviour cue reviewd. Results of this study will be useful in. designinig components for nodule mining systems as the long term performance in deep ocean cannot be easily simulated in the laboratory...|$|R
6000|$|In {{reply to}} your inquiry; {{requesting}} our written opinion {{as to what}} your duty requires you to do in executing the latter clause of the Seventh Section of [...] "An Act {{in relation to the}} payment of the principal and interest of the State debt," [...] approved Feb'y 22, 1859, we reply that said last clause of said section is certainly indefinite, general, and ambiguous in its description of the bonds to be issued by you; giving no time at which the bonds are to be made payable, no place at which either principal or interest are to be paid, and no rate of interest which the bonds are to bear; nor any other description except that they are to be coupon bonds, which in commercial usage means interest-paying bonds with obligations or orders attached to them for the payment of annual or semiannual interest; there is we suppose no difficulty in ascertaining, if this act stood alone, what ought to be the construction of the terms [...] "coupon bonds" [...] and that it, would mean bonds bearing interest from the time of issuing the same. And under this act considered by itself the creditors would have a right to require such bonds. But your inquiry in regard to a class of bonds on which no interest is to be paid or shall begin to run until January 1, 1860, is whether the Act of February 18, 1857, would not authorize you to refuse to give bonds with any <b>coupons</b> <b>attached</b> payable before the first day of July, 1860. We have very maturely considered this question and have arrived at the conclusion that {{you have a right to}} use such measures as will secure the State against the loss of six months' interest on these bonds by the indefiniteness of the Act of 1859. While it cannot be denied that the letter of the laws favor the construction claimed by some of the creditors that interest-bearing bonds were required to be issued to them, inasmuch as the restriction that no interest is to run on said bonds until 1st January, 1860, relates solely to the bonds issued under the Act of 1857. And the Act of 1859 directing you to issue new bonds does not contain this restriction, but directs you to issue coupon bonds. Nevertheless the very indefiniteness and generality of the Act of 1859, giving no rate of interest, no time due, no place of payment, no postponement of the time when interest commences, necessarily implies that the Legislature intended to invest you with a discretion to impose such terms and restrictions as would protect the interest of the State; and we think you have a right and that it is your duty to see that the State Bonds are so issued that the State shall not lose six months' interest. Two plans present themselves either of which will secure the State. 1st. If in literal compliance with the law you issue bonds bearing interest from 1st July, 1859, you may deduct from the bonds presented three thousand from every $100,000 of bonds and issue $97,000 of coupon bonds; by this plan $3000 out of $100,000 of principal would be extinguished in consideration of paying $2910 interest on the first of January, 1860--and the interest on the $3000 would forever cease; this would be no doubt most advantageous to the State. But if the Auditor will not consent to this, then, 2nd. Cut off of each bond all the coupons payable before 1st July, 1860.|$|R
40|$|During 2007 and 2008, a new Multi-Probe Corrosion Monitoring System (MPCMS) was {{designed}} and fabricated for use in double-shell tank 241 -AN- 102. The system was successfully installed in the tank on May 1, 2008. The 241 -AN- 102 MPCMS consists of one 'fixed' in-tank probe containing primary and secondary reference electrodes, tank material electrodes, Electrical Resistance (ER) sensors, and stressed and unstressed corrosion coupons. In addition to the fixed probe, the 241 -AN- 102 MPCMS also contains four standalone coupon racks, or 'removable' probes. Each rack contains stressed and unstressed coupons made of American Society of Testing and Materials A 537 CL 1 steel, heat-treated to closely match the chemical and mechanical characteristics of the 241 -AN- 102 tank wall. These coupon racks can be removed periodically to facilitate examination of the <b>attached</b> <b>coupons</b> for corrosion damage.
