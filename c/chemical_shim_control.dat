French PWRs use [...] "grey" [...] control rods made of boron steel, in order to replace <b>chemical</b> <b>shim,</b> without {{introducing}} a large perturbation of the power distribution.

The modified MSHIM control strategy is verified by simulations of three typical working conditions.

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study of}} changes in coolant {{activity}} due to corrosion products of extended burn-up cycles of 18 - 24 months duration, in a typical pressurized water reactor, under pH and boric acid variations. It deals with non-linearly changing corrosion rates coupled with pH effects. The CPAIR-P computer program was modified to accommodate for time-dependent rising corrosion and effects of coolant chemistry. These simulations suggest {{that the effect of}} an increase in pH value for an extended 24 -month cycle on a specific activity, {{in the form of a}} decrease in the said activity, is smeared by the rising corrosion. The new saturation values for activity at the end-of-cycle are lower than with a reactor operated at constant low pH/natural boric acid in the coolant. For a non-linear rise in the corrosion rate coupled with a pH rise from 6. 9 to 7. 4 and the use of enriched boric acid (30 %- 40 %), coolant activity first rises to a peak value during the cycle and then approaches a much smaller saturation value at the end of the cycle, when compared with the activity for the system having a constant low pH value (6. 9) in the coolant. In this work, we have shown that the use of enriched boric acid as a <b>chemical</b> <b>shim</b> actually lowers primary coolant activity when higher pH values, rather than natural boric acid, are employed in the coolant. For multiple long-term operating cycles, the saturation value of corrosion product activity increases in the first two cycles and becomes constant in subsequent ones, due to the high operational pH value for enriched boric acid (40 %) as a <b>chemical</b> <b>shim...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} account of the reactor physics studies for the final conceptual design of the Advanced Test Reactor is presented. The diffusion theory methods used for calculations of flux distributions and reactivity effects are described and compared with measurements and with higher order approximations to transport theory. These comparisons show diffusion theory to be adequate for the ATR conceptual design. Two-dimensional flux distributions {{for a number of}} <b>shim</b> <b>control</b> conditions and experimental loadings were determined by PDQ- 3 and TRANSAC-PDQ. The worths and effects on flux distributions of chemical and of blade type mechanical <b>shim</b> <b>controls</b> were compared. The effects of heavy water and of beryllium reflectors on reactivity and flux pattern were calculated. The time-dependent behavior of the reactor was investigated by use of TURBO and CANDLE. The changes in <b>shim</b> <b>control</b> poison and test and core flux distributions with fuel burnup were calculated and the full-power cycle time estimated. An investigation was made of the xenon transient after a fullpower shutdown and recovery. Results of one- and twodimensional fuel depletion studies are compared. The results of a number of time independent one-dimensional calculations and parametric studies are presented. Some comparisons were made of the results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional models of the ATR. The void coefficient of reactivity was found for the core, reflector, experiment, and flux trap regions of the reactor. Calculations of the temperature coefficient for the entire reactor and for individual regions were determined for one- and two-dimensional models. Xenon instability was studied for oscillations around one lobe, between lobes, and along the vertical axis. TURBO and CANDLE calculations were used {{to determine the effects of}} pedurbations on the sxial stability. An analytic method for determining axial stability was derived and applied to a single lobe model of the ATR. A perturbation technique was used to find the effects of reflector type and poisoning on the average core neutron lifetime. Calculations of the approximate lifetime of the delayed group from the reflector were made for a number of reflector conditions. Plots and tables of the gamma heat distribution in the ATR as determined by an DBM- 704 program are presented. (auth...|$|R
50|$|Other {{means of}} {{controlling}} reactivity include (for PWR) a soluble neutron absorber (boric acid) {{added to the}} reactor coolant, allowing the complete extraction of the control rods during stationary power operation, ensuring an even power and flux distribution over the entire core. This <b>chemical</b> <b>shim,</b> along {{with the use of}} burnable neutron poisons within the fuel pellets, is used to assist regulation of the core's long term reactivity, while the control rods are used for rapid reactor power changes (e.g. shutdown and start up). Operators of BWRs use the coolant flow through the core to control reactivity by varying the speed of the reactor recirculation pumps (an increase in coolant flow through the core improves the removal of steam bubbles, thus increasing the density of the coolant/moderator, increasing power).|$|R
40|$|The SYNBURN {{computer}} program for fast reactors will calculate all the neutronics necessary to completely characterize the equilibrium cycle {{as well as}} the startup to equilibrium cycles. The program's run time is very short and this makes the program suitable for survey of parametric studies. It can search on the cycle time for a specified burnup, for the <b>shim</b> <b>control</b> necessary for criticality as well as feed enrichments and the enrichment ratio among core zones. SYNBURN synthesizes in a very simple fashion the one-dimensional fluxes in radial and axial geometry to achieve an approximate two-dimensional solution which agrees very well with the exact two-dimensional solution when measuring regional integrated quantities...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{fatigue tests}} were {{performed}} to determine the surface durability life of a face gear in mesh with a tapered spur involute pinion. Twenty-four sets of gears were tested at three load levels: 7200, 8185, and 9075 lb-in face gear torque, and 2190 to 3280 rpm face gear speed. The gears were carburized and ground, shot-peened and vibro-honed, and made from VIM-VAR Pyrowear 53 steel per AMS 6308. The tests produced 17 gear tooth spalling failures and 7 suspensions. For all the failed sets, spalling occurred {{on at least one}} tooth of all the pinions. In some cases, the spalling initiated a crack in the pinion teeth which progressed to tooth fracture. Also, spalling occurred on some face gear teeth. The AGMA endurance allowable stress for a tapered spur involute pinion in mesh with a face gear was determined to be 275 ksi for the material tested. For the application of a tapered spur involute pinion in mesh with a face gear, proper face gear <b>shim</b> <b>controlled</b> the desired gear tooth contact pattern while proper pinion shim was an effective way of adjusting backlash without severely affecting the contact pattern...|$|R
50|$|Soluble poisons, {{also called}} <b>chemical</b> <b>shim,</b> produce a {{spatially}} uniform neutron absorption when dissolved {{in the water}} coolant. The most common soluble poison in commercial pressurized water reactors (PWR) is boric acid, which {{is often referred to}} as soluble boron. The boric acid in the coolant decreases the thermal utilization factor, causing a decrease in reactivity. By varying the concentration of boric acid in the coolant, a process referred to as boration and dilution, the reactivity of the core can be easily varied. If the boron concentration is increased, the coolant/moderator absorbs more neutrons, adding negative reactivity. If the boron concentration is reduced (dilution), positive reactivity is added. The changing of boron concentration in a PWR is a slow process and is used primarily to compensate for fuel burnout or poison buildup. The variation in boron concentration allows control rod use to be minimized, which results in a flatter flux profile over the core than can be produced by rod insertion. The flatter flux profile occurs because there are no regions of depressed flux like those that would be produced in the vicinity of inserted control rods. This system is not in widespread use because the chemicals make the moderator temperature reactivity coefficient less negative. All commercial PWR types operating in the US (Westinghouse, Combustion Engineering, and Babcock & Wilcox) employ soluble boron to control excess reactivity. US Navy reactors and Boiling Water Reactors do not.|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} for calculating inventories for the NBSR {{has been developed}} using the MCNPX computer code with the BURN option. A major advantage of the present methodology over the previous methodology, where MONTEBURNS and MCNP 5 were used, is that more materials can {{be included in the}} model. The NBSR has 30 fuel elements each with a 17. 8 cm (7 in) gap {{in the middle of the}} fuel. In the startup position, the <b>shim</b> <b>control</b> arms are partially inserted in the top half of the core. During the 38. 5 day cycle, the shim arms are slowly removed to their withdrawn (horizontal) positions. This movement of shim arms causes asymmetries between the burnup of the fuel in the upper and lower halves and across the line of symmetry for the fuel loading. With the MONTEBURNS analyses there was a limitation to the number of materials that could be analyzed so 15 materials in the top half of the core and 15 materials in the bottom half of the core were used, and a half-core (east-west) symmetry was assumed. Since MCNPX allows more materials, this east-west symmetry was not necessary and the core was represented with 60 different materials. The {{methodology for}} developing the inventories is presented along with comparisons of neutronic parameters calculated with the previous and present sets of inventories...|$|R
40|$|The AGR- 1 Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR) tristructural-isotropic-particle fuel {{experiment}} underwent 13 irradiation intervals from December 2006 until November 2009 {{within the}} Idaho National Laboratory Advanced Test Reactor {{in support of}} the Next Generation Nuclear Power Plant program. During this multi-year experiment, release-to-birth rate ratios were computed {{at the end of each}} operating interval to provide information about fuel performance. Fission products released during irradiation were tracked daily by the Fission Product Monitoring System using 8 -hour measurements. Birth rates calculated by MCNP with ORIGEN for as-run conditions were computed at the end of each irradiation interval. Each time step in MCNP provided neutron flux, reaction rates and AGR- 1 compact composition, which were used to determine birth rates using ORIGEN. The initial birth-rate data, consisting of four values for each irradiation interval at the beginning, end, and two intermediate times, were interpolated to obtain values for each 8 -hour activity. The problem with this method is that any daily changes in heat rates or perturbations, such as <b>shim</b> <b>control</b> movement or core/lobe power fluctuations, would not be reflected in the interpolated data and a true picture of the system would not be presented. At the conclusion of the AGR- 1 experiment, great efforts were put forth to compute daily birthrates, which were reprocessed with the 8 -hour release activity. The results of this study are presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{presented}} a new optimization procedure that {{allows one to}} reduce SAR in MRI exam and control the polarization. Contrary to other <b>shimming</b> procedures <b>controlling</b> the polarization of the field consent us to control the power delivered to the entire system. Consequently SNR is improved and the proposed method would be used also in 1. 5 T and 3 T MRI. Such kind of technique was tested in a simple scenario {{and it could be}} extended to a realistic one. We noticed that Bi shimming would cause a decreasing in the flip angle value as reported. Further the application of such kind of technique to a real case will be investigated in future work...|$|R

40|$|Parametric {{studies were}} carried out to {{optimize}} the performance and obtain an understanding of the nuclear characteristics of the Advanced Engneering Test Reactor (AE TR) design concept. Two-dimensional two-group diffusion theory calculations were performed for the purpose of evaluating the worth of the droppable safety reflector. Removal of the D/sub 2 /O from the 4 -in. thick safety reflector region from the level of the top of the active core {{to the level of the}} bottom of the active core with a fully poisoned shim reflectcr region resulted in a decrease in the multiplication factor from 0. 9911 to 0. 7515. Removal of the D/ sub 2 /O from the 4 -in. thick safety reflector region with a clean D/sub 2 /O shim reflector resulted in a decrease in the multiplication factor from 1. 18 to about 1. 04. This indicated that the safety reflector wonth decreases as the boron poison is removed from the shim reflector during the core life. An iterative procedure using one-dimensional three-group dlifusion theory calculations was performed to determine a graded fuel distribution which produces a flat radial power density. The calculations were terminated when the maximum-toaverage power density was reduced to 1. 018. Burnup calculations, using the CANDLE one- dimensional, four-group diffusion theory depletion code, were performed for flat and graded fuel cores, each containing 12 kg U/sup 235 / initially. The radial variations in the fuel distributions and the power density distributions during the fuel cycle were determined at several times. The effectiveness of a burnable core poison to supplement the soluble-poison <b>shim</b> <b>control</b> in the reflector was investignted. Using a Bi/sup 10 /poisoning of 0. 075 reduced the initial multiplication factor by 5. 9 %. By adjusting the fuel loading and optimizing the burnable poison, it appeared that the 19 -day fuel cycle is feasible. (M. C. G. ...|$|R
40|$|In 2001, while {{performing}} routine radioactive decay heat rate calculations for beryllium reflector blocks for the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), it became evident {{that there may}} be sufficient concentrations of transuranic isotopes to require classification of this irradiated beryllium as transuranic waste. Measurements on samples from ATR reflector blocks and further calculations confirmed that for reflector blocks and outer <b>shim</b> <b>control</b> cylinders now in the ATR canal, transuranic activities are about five times the threshold for classification. That situation implies that there is no apparent disposal pathway for this material. The problem is not unique to the ATR. The High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Missouri University Research Reactor at Columbia, Missouri and other reactors abroad must also deal with this issue. A workshop was held in Idaho Falls Idaho on May 29 - 30, 2002 to acquaint stakeholders with these findings and consider a path forward in resolving the issues attendant to disposition of irradiated material. Among the findings from this workshop were (1) there is a real potential for the US to be dependent on foreign sources for metallic beryllium within about a decade; (2) {{there is a need for}} a national policy on beryllium utilization and disposition and for a beryllium coordinating committee to be assembled to provide guidance on that policy; (3) it appears it will be difficult to dispose of this material at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico due to issues of Defense classification, facility radioactivity inventory limits, and transportation to WIPP; (4) there is a need for a funded DOE program to seek resolution of these issues including research on processing techniques that may make this waste acceptable in an existing disposal pathway or allow for its recycle...|$|R

40|$|The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) is a {{high power}} and high neutron flux {{research}} reactor operating in the United States. Powered with highly enriched uranium (HEU), the ATR has a maximum thermal power rating of 250 MWth. Because of the high total core power and high neutron flux, the ATR is an ideal candidate for assessing the feasibility of converting an HEU driven reactor to a low-enriched core. An optimized low-enriched uranium (LEU) (U- 10 Mo) core conversion case, which can meet the project requirements, has been selected. However, LEU contains a significant quantity of high density U- 238 (80. 3 wt. %), which will harden the neutron spectrum in the core region. Based on the reference ATR HEU and the optimized LEU full core plate-by-plate (PBP) models, the present work investigates and compares the neutron spectra differences in the fuel element (FE), Northeast flux trap (NEFT), Southeast flux trap (SEFT), and East flux trap (EFT) positions. A detailed PBP MCNP ATR core model was developed and validated for fuel cycle burnup comparison analysis. The current ATR core with HEU U 235 enrichment of 93. 0 wt. % {{was used as the}} reference model. Each HEU fuel element contains 19 fuel plates with a fuel meat thickness of 0. 508 mm (20 mil). In this work, an optimized LEU (U- 10 Mo) core conversion case with a nominal fuel meat thickness of 0. 330 mm (13 mil) and the U- 235 enrichment of 19. 7 wt. % was used to calculate the impact of the neutron spectrum in FE and FT positions. MCNP-calculated results show that the neutron spectrum in the LEU FE is slightly harder than in the HEU FE, as expected. However, when neutrons transport through water coolant and beryllium (Be), the neutrons are thermalized to an equilibrium neutron spectrum as a function of water volume fraction in the investigated FT positions. As a result, the neutron spectrum differences of the HEU and LEU in the NEFT, SEFT, and EFT are negligible. To demonstrate that the LEU core fuel cycle performance can meet the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) safety requirements, additional studies will be necessary to evaluate and compare safety parameters such as void reactivity and Doppler coefficients, control components worth (outer <b>shim</b> <b>control</b> cylinders, safety rods and regulating rod), and shutdown margins between the HEU and LEU cores...|$|R

A significant drawback of True- FISP is its sensitivity to off-resonance effects caused by an imperfect <b>shim,</b> <b>chemical</b> shifts, eddy currents, and Maxwell effects. An extension of the two-dimensional TrueFISP sequence to an ECG gated three-dimensional TrueFISP sequence is thus not straight forward and requires a very carefully designed acquisition scheme.

40|$|Future long-link, ultra-speed, surface {{transport}} systems will require electromagnetically (EM) driven and restrained vehicles operating under reduced-atmosphere in very straight tubes. Such tube-flight trains will be safe, energy conservative, pollution-free, {{and in a}} protected environment. Hypersonic (and even hyperballistic) speeds are theoretically achievable. Ultimate system choices will represent tradeoffs between amoritized capital costs (ACC) and operating costs. For example, long coasting links might employ aerodynamic lift coupled with EM restraint and drag make-up. Optimized, combined EM lift, and thrust vectors could reduce energy costs but at increased ACC. (Repulsive levitation can produce lift-over-drag l/d ratios a decade greater than aerodynamic), Alternatively, vehicle-emanated, induced-mirror fields in a conducting (aluminum sheet) road bed could reduce ACC but at substantial energy costs.
