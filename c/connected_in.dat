5|$|Egyptian deities are <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> {{a complex}} and {{shifting}} array of relationships. A god's connections and interactions with other deities helped define its character.

5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray {{spends much}} of its time lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E
5|$|Individuals with {{schizophrenia}} {{may experience}} hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech. The last may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> meaning, to speech {{that is not}} understandable known as word salad. Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|On October 29, 1969, {{the first}} {{connection}} {{on a wide}} area network to use packet switching, ARPANET, was established between nodes at Leonard Kleinrock's laboratory at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Douglas Engelbart's laboratory at SRI using Interface Message Processors at both sites. The following year, Engelbart's laboratory installed the first TENEX system outside of BBN where it was developed. In addition to SRI and UCLA, University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Utah {{were part of the}} original four network nodes. By December 5, 1969, the entire four-node network was <b>connected.</b> <b>In</b> the 1970s, SRI developed packet-switched radio (a precursor to wireless networking), over-the-horizon radar, Deafnet, vacuum microelectronics, and software-implemented fault tolerance.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Mariana {{is connected to}} Shakespeare's Measure for Measure; {{there is a direct}} quotation of Shakespeare's play in regards to a {{character of}} the same name. In Shakespeare's play, Mariana is rejected by the character Angelo and lives alone as she pines over her love. Tennyson's version is set in Lincolnshire, not Vienna as in the Shakespeare play. This makes the characters completely English. Additionally, the scene within the poem does not have any of the original context but the two works are <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> imagery {{with the idea of a}} dull life and a dejected female named Mariana.|$|E
5|$|The design {{architecture}} of USB is asymmetrical in its topology, {{consisting of a}} host, a multitude of downstream USB ports, and multiple peripheral devices <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> a tiered-star topology. Additional USB hubs may {{be included in the}} tiers, allowing branching into a tree structure with up to five tier levels. A USB host may implement multiple host controllers and each host controller may provide one or more USB ports. Up to 127 devices, including hub devices if present, may be connected to a single host controller. USB devices are linked in series through hubs. One hub—built into the host controller—is the root hub.|$|E

According to David Crouch, Agnes was Gilbert de Lacy's aunt, which if true would make de Lacy and Talbot first cousins. He was also a relative of Sybil, the wife of Pain fitzJohn, who was his heiress. He probably served as a household knight for Robert, the Earl of Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|The main {{electrical}} {{system on the}} B.1/B.1A was 112V DC supplied by four 22.5kW engine-driven starter-generators. Backup power was provided by four 24V 40Ah batteries <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> series providing 96V. Secondary {{electrical system}}s were 28V DC, single-phase 115V AC at 1600Hz, and three-phase 115V AC at 400Hz, driven by transformers and inverters from the main system. The 28V DC system was backed up by a single 24V battery.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller {{will be required to}} write that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write the data from the host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E

5|$|The {{railways}} {{arrived in}} the 19th century. Early proposals to bring a line to Sleaford failed, but in 1852 plans were made to build the Boston, Sleaford and Midland Counties Railway and its Act of Parliament passed in 1853. The line from Grantham opened in 1857; Boston was <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> 1859, Bourne in 1871 and Ruskington on Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway in 1882.|$|E
5|$|A {{more complex}} example of stepped {{impedance}} design {{is presented in}} figure 6. Again, narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has resonators <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> shunt across the main line. This topology {{can be used to}} design elliptical filters or Chebyshev filters with poles of attenuation in the stopband. However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as m-derived filters instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose of incorporating resonators is to improve the stopband rejection. However, beyond the resonant frequency of the highest frequency resonator, the stopband rejection starts to deteriorate as the resonators are moving towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter. This also ensures good rejection at high frequency.|$|E
5|$|Areoles {{are highly}} {{specialized}} and very condensed shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes {{are so close}} together, they form a single structure. The areole may be circular, elongated into an oval shape, or even separated into two parts; the two parts may be visibly <b>connected</b> <b>in</b> some way (e.g. by a groove in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part nearer {{the top of the}} stem then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have multicellular hairs (trichomes) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown.|$|E
