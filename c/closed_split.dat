50|$|In 2002, {{the team}} {{made plans to}} run the full schedule. The team made 25 of the 34 races, all with Harmon driving the car. Much like 2001, {{it was a very}} {{turbulent}} season for Mixon and Harmon. They only finished three races, did not qualify (DNQ) for nine. The most memorable part of the season for the team occurred during a Thursday practice at Bristol. Harmon lost control of his Chevrolet and hit the guardrail. The guardrail, not properly <b>closed,</b> <b>split</b> Harmon's car in half. Amazingly, Harmon walked away. After that, the team finished 43rd the following night. There were some bright spots for 2002, however. The team set its career best qualifying effort at Loudon and matched its best effort of 28th at Fontana. The team also had some support from COX Communications for 2002.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{that there is}} a strong diamagnetic response of metamaterials, consisting of open or <b>closed</b> <b>split</b> ring resonators (SRRs). Detailed numerical work shows that for densely packed SRRs the magnetic permeability, μ(ω), does not approach unity, as expected for frequencies lower and higher than the resonance frequency, ω_ 0. Below ω_ 0, μ(ω) gives values ranging from 0. 9 to 0. 6 depending of the width of the metallic ring, while above ω_ 0, μ(ω) is close to 0. 5. Closed rings have μ≈ 0. 5 over a wide frequency range independently of the width of the ring. A simple model that uses the inner and outer current loop of the SRRs can easily explain theoretically this strong diamagnetic response, which can be used in magnetic levitation...|$|E

40|$|A super Lie {{group is}} a group whose {{operations}} are G ∞ mappings {{in the sense of}} Rogers. Thus the underlying supermanifold possesses an atlas whose transition functions are G ∞ functions. Moreover the images of our charts are open subsets of a graded infinite-dimensional Banach space since our space of supernumbers is a Banach Grassmann algebra with a countably infinite set of generators. In this context, we prove that if h is a <b>closed,</b> <b>split</b> sub-super Lie algebra of the super Lie algebra of a super Lie group G, then h is the super Lie algebra of a sub-super Lie group of G. Additionally, we show that if g is a Banach super Lie algebra satisfying certain natural conditions, then there is a super Lie group G such that the even part of g is the even part of the super Lie algebra of G. In general, the module structure on g is required to obtain G, but the “structure constants ” involving the odd part of g can not be recovered without further restrictions. We also show that if H is a closed sub-super Lie group of a super Lie group G, then G → G/H is a principal fiber bundle. Finally, we show that if g is a graded Lie algebra over C, then there is a super Lie group whose super Lie algebra is the Grassmann shell of g. We also briefly relate our theory to techniques used in the physics literature. We emphasize that some of these theorems are known when the space of supernumbers is finitely generated in which case one can use finite-dimensional techniques. The issues dealt with here are that our supermanifolds are modeled on graded Banach spaces and that all mappings must be morphisms in the G ∞ category...|$|E

40|$|A split {{hopper barge}} is a {{dredging}} vessel that can split over its longitudinal axis to discharge its cargo. To allow {{for such an}} operation, the barge consists of two half-hulls that are connected by hinges {{at the top and}} hydraulic cylinders at the bottom. Any forces that act at the interface between the half-hulls have to be transferred by the hinges and cylinders as a result. The aim of this thesis is to develop a method to determine the workability limits of split hopper barges in irregular seas. For this workability of the barge, the design limits of the hinges and hydraulic cylinders are assumed to be governing. A quasi-static model is formulated {{to determine the effects of}} roll, different types of cargo, opening the barge and discharging the cargo on the forces in the hinges and cylinders. The results of the quasi-static model are a set of governing load cases for the split hopper barge. From the quasi-static model, it is found that the forces of interest are the largest for a <b>closed</b> <b>split</b> hopper barge and that either a solid or a liquid cargo will yield the governing load case. To account for the dynamics in irregular sea conditions, a calculation method is proposed based on Ansys AQWA. Since AQWA is not able to account for liquid cargo motions, its effects are incorporated separately. Using WAMIT simulations, the influences of the liquid cargo to the added mass and stiffness of the barge are determined. Based on the WAMIT results the AQWA model is adjusted. Superimposing the results from the quasi-static and dynamic models, the maximum forces in the hinges and hydraulic cylinders are obtained for the governing load cases. By comparing the obtained maximum forces to the design forces, a conclusion on the workability limits of the split hopper barge is drawn. For the barge carrying a solid cargo only one resonance frequency is found, while, due to the liquid cargo motions, the barge with a liquid cargo has two resonance frequencies. As a result, a larger number of combinations of wave directions and periods yield considerable forces. For a 3 -hour-extreme with a significant wave height of 3 meters, the governing hydraulic cylinder forces are found for a barge carrying a liquid cargo. The maximum resulting hinge forces however, are found for a barge carrying a solid cargo. Because the limits of the hinges are exceeded before the limits of the hydraulic cylinders, it is concluded that the workability limits of the split hopper barge in irregular waves are most limited, and therefore governing, for a barge carrying a solid cargo...|$|E
