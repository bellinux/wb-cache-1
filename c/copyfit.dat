50|$|As digital font design allows more {{variants}} to {{be created}} faster, an increasingly common development in professional font design {{is the use of}} “grades”: slightly different weights intended for different types of paper and ink, or printing in a different region with different ambient temperature and humidity. For example, a thin design printed on book paper and a thicker design printed on high-gloss magazine paper may come out looking identical, since in the former case the ink will soak and spread out more. Grades are typically offered with characters having the same width on all grades, so that a change of printing materials does not affect <b>copyfit.</b> Grades are especially common on serif fonts with their finer details.|$|E
50|$|While many {{geometric}} sans-serif typefaces {{have been}} released {{to compete with the}} popular typeface Futura, Century Gothic is perhaps unique in its origin: it redraws one to match the design proportions of a second. Century Gothic was created to be a substitute font for ITC Avant Garde, designed by Herb Lubalin, and released by the International Typeface Corporation (ITC) in 1970, so a document created in one can be displayed in the other with no change to <b>copyfit.</b> This allows it to substitute interchangeably for Avant Garde in documents, an important feature since Avant Garde is a standard font in some forms of the PostScript digital printing standard, and so Century Gothic allowed Microsoft to use it in preference to paying for an ITC Avant Garde license.|$|E

Obviously, in the United States and other countries, English is the first and main one. But there are two others. Our second language is medical terminol-ogy, often corrupted by jargon or medicalese, a conversational convenience but not appropri-ate for serious writing. Regardless of our varied backgrounds, {{we have to know}} what retinal hemorrhage, scoliosis, and myriad other terms mean. Our third language, not always necessary but helpful if the writer or editor engages in any volume of work, is that of communica-tion—printing, publishing, journalism—for example, <b>copyfit,</b> color separation, and blueline. Ah, there’s the rub. In a great number of instances, a word we use means something different in medicine and in media language, and maybe occasionally something different from the straight English meaning. So, a “cut ” is not always a “cut ” or at least does not always have the same meaning. Richar...|$|E
