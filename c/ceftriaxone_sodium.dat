The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance pattern of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in goat slaughtered at Dire Dawa municipal abattoir, Ethiopia. A total of 235 samples were collected from cecal contents, carcass and environment sample (slaughter house worker’s hand, knife and carcass wash water) as 93, 93 and 49, respectively through the months of January and April. E. coli O 157 :H 7 was identified by the method slightly modified to ISO 16654 : 2001. The samples were initially enriched in modified trypticase broth containing novobiocin supplement, followed by plating onto sorbitol MacConkey agar. Consequently, the suspected non-sorbitol fermenting (NSF) colonies were confirmed as E. coli biochemically using indole test and selected for serotyping. Out of 235 samples collected, the overall prevalence of 2. 55 % (comprising of 2. 15 %, 3. 22 % and 2. 04 of cecal contents, carcass swab and environmental samples respectively) had positive results for Dryspot E. coli O 157 latex test kit (Oxoid, DR 120 M).

40|$|Introduction: Wipple disease (WD) {{is a rare}} {{chronic disease}} caused by the {{bacillus}} Tropheryma whipplei. Constitutive, rheumatologic, gastrointestinal, cardiac, cerebral, lymphatic, cutaneous, and ophthalmological signs are possible systemic symptoms. However, thrombotic manifestations are rarely described as “stroke-like syndrome” or arterial thrombosis. Diagnosis is based on clinical manifestations and pathological examination. Laboratory findings may include anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. Objective: We report a case of venous thrombosis as initial manifestation of WD. Case Report: We describe {{the case of a}} 53 -year-old male with iliofemoral vein thrombosis followed by intermittent diarrhea, loss of appetite, abdominal distension, and bloating. A mild malnutrition state with a weight loss of 13 kg, pallor (+/ 4 +), presence of lower-limb edema (+/ 4 +), and hypertympanic distended abdomen occurred. Laboratory tests on admission revealed anemia, positive inflammatory activity tests, and normal coagulation. Endoscopic examination showed villous edema with white dotted infiltrates in the second duodenal portion and intestinal lymphangiectasia in the terminal ileum. Pathological examination revealed numerous macrophages with positive periodic acid-Schiff inclusions. Venous Doppler ultrasound showed extensive deep thrombosis on the left lower limb and recanalization of the femoral vein in the right lower limb. The patient was treated with <b>ceftriaxone</b> and enoxaparin <b>sodium,</b> which led to an improvement of gastrointestinal and thrombosis symptoms.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium</b> {{in the treatment of}} streptococcal endocarditis. DESIGN [...] An open, multicenter, noncomparative study with a follow-up of patients for 4 months to 5 years. SETTING [...] Internal medicine wards and outpatient clinics of hospitals of various sizes in three European countries. PATIENTS [...] Fifty-nine patients with defined criteria for streptococcal endocarditis. INTERVENTION [...] <b>Ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium</b> administered at a once-daily dose of 2 g for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Clinical outcome and microbiological cure rate. RESULTS [...] Among the 59 patients, 55 completed the treatment and were followed up for 4 months to 5 years. No patients showed evidence of relapse. Treatment was completely uneventful in 42 patients (71 %). A cardiac valve was replaced in four patients (7 %) receiving antimicrobial therapy and in six patients (10 %) who had completed antimicrobial therapy. One of the 10 valves taken for culture at surgery was positive, but only for microorganisms that were different from the microorganism isolated before the treatment. The treatment had to be interrupted in four patients because of drug allergy. Other side effects were mild except for two cases of reversible neutropenia. The treatment was easy to administer: 27 patients (46 %) had no permanent intravenous catheter at any time, seven patients (12 %) had such a catheter for less than 4 days.

DESCRIPTION Rocephin is a sterile, semisynthetic, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic for intravenous or intramuscular administration. <b>Ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium</b> is (6 R, 7 R) - 7 -[2 -(2 -Amino- 4 -thiazolyl) glyoxylamido]- 8 -oxo- 3 -[[(1, 2, 5, 6 -tetrahydro- 2 -methyl- 5, 6 -dioxo-as-triazin- 3 -yl) thio]methyl]- 5 -thia- 1 -azabicyclo[4. 2. 0]oct- 2 -ene- 2 -carboxylic acid, 72 -(Z) -(O-methyloxime), disodium salt, sesquaterhydrate. The chemical formula of <b>ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium</b> is C 18 H 16 N 8 Na 2 O 7 S 3 • 3. 5 H 2 O. It has a calculated molecular weight of 661. 59 and the following structural formula: Rocephin is a white to yellowish-orange crystalline powder which is readily soluble in water, sparingly soluble in methanol and very slightly soluble in ethanol. The pH of a 1 % aqueous solution is approximately 6. 7. The color of Rocephin solutions ranges from light yellow to amber, depending on the length of storage, concentration and diluent used. Rocephin contains approximately 83 mg (3. 6 mEq) of sodium per gram of ceftriaxone activity.

40|$|The {{adverse impact}} of {{antibiotics}} on the gut microbiota has attracted extensive interest, particularly {{due to the}} development of microbiome research techniques in recent years. However, a direct comparison of the dynamic effects of various types of antibiotics using the same animal model has not been available. In the present study, we selected six antibiotics from four categories with the broadest clinical usage, namely, β-lactams (<b>Ceftriaxone</b> <b>Sodium,</b> Cefoperazone/Sulbactam and meropenem), quinolones (ofloxacin), glycopeptides (vancomycin), and macrolides (azithromycin), to treat BALB/c mice. Stool samples were collected during and after the administration of antibiotics, and microbial diversity was analyzed through Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics analyses using QIIME. Both α and β diversity analyses showed that <b>ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium,</b> cefoperazone/sulbactam, meropenem and vancomycin changed the gut microbiota dramatically by the second day of antibiotic administration whereas the influence of ofloxacin was trivial. Azithromycin clearly changed the gut microbiota but much less than vancomycin and the β-lactams. In general, the community changes induced by the three β-lactam antibiotics showed consistency in inhibiting Papillibacter, Prevotella and Alistipes while inducing massive growth of Clostridium. The low diversity and high Clostridium level might be an important cause of Clostridium difficile infection after usage of β-lactams. Vancomycin was unique in that it inhibited Firmicutes, mainly the genus Clostridium. On the other hand, it induced the growth of Escherichia and effect lasted for months afterward. Azithromycin and meropenem induced the growth of Enterococcus.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} intramuscular (IM) <b>ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium</b> {{in the treatment of}} chronic donovanosis, and the acceptability to patients and staff of supervised outpatient treatment in rural clinics. METHODS [...] We collected demographic and sexual health data from participants using a standard questionnaire, and recorded their donovanosis lesions at baseline using genital diagrams. Treatment consisted of a single daily IM injection of 1 g ceftriaxone diluted in 2 ml of 1 % lignocaine. Clinic staff followed patients for between three and 12 months, enabling the detection of late recurrences. SETTING [...] Rural Aboriginal communities in central Australia. PARTICIPANTS [...] The study describes eight women and four men with chronic donovanosis in detail, and summarises the outcome in 12 additional cases. All cases presented with advanced lesions which had failed to heal on the standard oral antibiotic regimens used in the region. RESULTS [...] The mean duration of infection was 3. 0 years (SD 1. 9 years), and between four and ten courses of antibiotics had been prescribed for six of the 12 patients. Patients received between 7 - 26 g of <b>ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium.</b> Clinical improvement was dramatic in most lesions, and four patients healed completely without recurrence after a total 7 - 10 g of ceftriaxone. Mild recurrences responded to further ceftriaxone or short courses of oral antibiotics. Treatment was well tolerated, and both patient and staff compliance high. CONCLUSION [...] Donovanosis is an important cause of chronic genital ulceration in central Australia, and is potentially an important risk factor for HIV transmission in Aboriginal communities. The pharmacokinetics and safety profile of ceftriaxone make it a useful and cost-effective agent in the ambulatory management of donovanosis, especially in remote communities.

Two kinds of macro-cross-linkers with two azido groups at one chain-end and different chain length [PNIPAM–(N 3) 2 and PDMAEMA–(N 3) 2] were prepared with N,N-di(β-azidoethyl) 2 -halocarboxylamide as the ATRP initiator. Through RAFT copolymerization of DMAEMA or NIPAM with propargyl acrylate (ProA) using dibenzyltrithiocarbonate as a chain transfer agent, two network precursors with different content of alkynyl side-groups [P(DMAEMA-co-ProA) and P(NIPAM-co-ProA) ] were obtained. The subsequent azido-alkynyl click reaction of macro-cross-linkers and network precursors {{led to the formation}} of the network-graft hydrogels. These dual stimulus-sensitive hydrogels exhibited rapid response, high swelling ratio and reproducible swelling/de-swelling cycles under different temperatures and pH values. The influences of cross-linkage density and network-graft architecture on the properties of the hydrogels were investigated. The release of <b>ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium</b> from these hydrogels showed both thermal- and pH-dependence, suggesting the feasibility of these hydrogels as thermo- and pH-dependent drug release devices...|$|E

She had been prescribed <b>ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium</b> (0. 5 gm twice a day) for soft tissue abscess {{over the right}} flank {{two days before the}} start of her symptoms. Abdominal examinations revealed diffuse tenderness in the abdomen with normal bowel sounds. Hb was 11. 0 g/dl and white blood cell was 8470 /mm 3. A 99 m Tc (V) -DMSA abdominal scan was performed with a gamma camera (Vertex, ADAC, USA) at 2 h following intravenous administration of 20 mCi (760 MBq) of 99 m Tc (V) -DMSA. Increased radioactivity in the transverse colon and descending colon was seen; there was no obvious abnormal radiotracer uptake over the right flank. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed increased soft tissue strands {{by the side of the}} splenic flexure and a thick parietal peritoneum by the side of the descending colon. A barium enema of the colon exhibited no stenotic lesion throughout the rectal and colonic loop and no abnormal filling defect. Colonoscopy showed diffuse inflammatory change with swelling, hyperemia, and ulceration over the descending colon. Colonoscopy failed to reveal a pseudomembrane.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to present and discuss {{ultrasound}} findings of prenatal fetal cholelithiasis in two cases with different etiology and evolution. Case 1 : a pregnant woman from sub-Saharan Africa, suffering from Lyme disease, was treated with <b>ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium.</b> Six weeks later, biliary sludge associated with polyhydramnios was detected in the fetus and the fetal growth percentile was 14. Emergency caesarean was performed at 36 weeks of gestation due to fetal distress. Biliary sludge persists in the two-and-a-half-year-old child. Case 2 : the fetus of a Caucasian woman with normal pregnancy showed multiple cholelithiasis associated with polyhydramnios at 31 weeks of gestation. At 39 weeks and 4 days, cesarean section was performed due to lack of dilation. The biliary disease resolved spontaneously at seven months of age, with no associated abnormalities. In conclusion, prenatal diagnosis of cholelithiasis is straightforward, but prognosis cannot be defined yet. Serious complications do not arise in 70 % of cases, but severe diseases may ensue in 20 %. Persistence of cholelithiasis after one year of age results in cholelithiasis in childhood and beyond. Biliary sludge is associated with worse prognosis than cholelithiasis when it appears before 28 weeks of gestation...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to compare few {{physical}} parameters of the marketed products of <b>Ceftriaxone</b> <b>Sodium</b> for injection 1 g manufactured by generic and innovator company nearing the expiry date. The marketed samples of generic and innovator company were tested for physical parameters like Appearance, pH, clarity, reconstitution time and primary packing quality. All the samples were reconstituted and pH was determined using calibrated pH meter. From the results it was found that few physical parameters were comparable in innovator and generic samples with respect to parameters like pH and clarity whereas phenomenal difference was observed in reconstitution time and appearance of the product. Innovator product showed very less reconstitution time, good clarity of reconstituted solution and acceptable physical appearance or description. The increase in reconstitution time & inferior physical appearance observations of generic product may be because of sourcing of raw materials from less regulated countries (economic source) or depends on other important processing parameters like method of manufacturing (different process employed by innovator and generic company), in-process controls, quality of starting materials or even quality of intermediates used for manufacturing of raw materials that is being sourced by the generic company...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 18 {{selected}} cows with endometritis were randomly allocated to 3 groups, comprising of 6 animals in each group. <b>Ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium</b> at a dose rate of 10 mg/kg body weight was administered only once through I.

40|$|A simple, {{accurate}} and precise spectrophotometric method {{has been proposed}} for the determination of eleven cephalosporins, namely; cefaclor monohydrate, cefadroxil monohydrate, cefalexin anhydrous, cefradine anhydrous, cefotaxime sodium, cefoperazone sodium, <b>ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium,</b> ceftazidime penthydrate, cefazolin sodium, cefixime and cefpodoxime pro- xetil in bulk drug and in pharmaceutical formulations. The method depends on hydrolysis of the studied drugs using 0. 5 M NaOH at 100 °C and subsequent reaction of the formed sulfide ions with NBD-Cl (4 -chloro- 7 -nitrobenzo- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole) to form a yellow-colored chromogen measured at 390 nm. Different variables affecting the reaction (e. g. NaOH concentration, hydrolysis time, NBD-Cl concentration and diluting solvent) were studied and optimized. Under the optimum conditions, linear relationships with good correlation coefficients (0. 9990 - 0. 9999) {{were found in the}} range of 5 - 160 μg mL- 1 for all studied drugs. The limits of assay detection and quantitiation ranged from 0. 289 to 5. 867 and from 0. 878 to 17. 778 μg mL- 1; respectively. The accuracy and precision of the proposed method were satisfactory.

40|$|<b>Ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium,</b> a new {{cephalosporin}} with a {{very broad}} spectrum of action and a very long serum half-life, was administered to 127 patients {{in the treatment of}} 133 severe infections at our institution in Lausanne, Switzerland. Eighty infections had previously been treated unsuccessfully with other antimicrobials to which the pathogens were most often resistant. Sixty-five episodes were treated with two daily injections until there was an improvement in the patient's clinical condition, while 67 infections were treated from the start by a single daily injection. The results in the two groups were similar. One hundred fifteen infections (86 %) were cured or improved, ten (8 %) did not respond to therapy or recurred, and eight (6 %) were not evaluable. The treatment was well tolerated, even by the 18 patients who received the drug for more than four weeks. The administration of a single daily dose instead of four doses as with standard antibiotic regimens produced a saving of Sfr 84, 000 (+ 42, 000) in the 127 patients. The single daily dose also made it possible to treat 25 of the 127 severely ill patients as outpatients, with a saving of Sfr 388, 500 (+ 195, 000) with respect to the hospital costs that would have been incurred for the same time period...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: This work {{investigates the}} {{incidence}} and clinical features of syphilitic uveitis in patients infected with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed syphilitic uveitis in patients coinfected with HIV that presented at a referral center between July 2001 and November 2003. RESULTS: Twelve patients (20 eyes) were included. The ocular manifestations of syphilis led {{to the discovery of}} HIV- 1 seropositivity in three patients. All patients were male and homosexual. One patient has been previously treated for syphilis with benzathine penicillin G. One patient presented with anterior uveitis and 11 patients had panuveitis or posterior uveitis. Necrotizing retinitis was noted in seven eyes (35 %), posterior placoid chorioretinitis in six eyes (30 %) and optic nerve involvement in five eyes (25 %). Of nine patients with available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies, seven (77. 8 %) had CSF abnormalities. Eleven patients were treated with intravenous penicillin G and one with intravenous <b>ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium.</b> One patient required a second course of antibiotics to control uveitis. Ocular inflammation decreased and visual acuity improved in all nine patients for whom follow-up was available after treatment. CONCLUSION: Manifestations of syphilitic uveitis in HIV-infected patients are multiple, with high frequencies of posterior uveitis, posterior placoid chorioretinitis, necrotizing retinitis and optic nerve involvement. Syphilitic uveitis in HIV-infected patients seems to have a more severe course and may relapse despite high-dose intravenous penicillin therapy...|$|E
40|$|Two {{universal}} spectral ranges (4550 – 4100 cm- 1 and 6190 – 5510 cm- 1) {{for construction}} of quantitative models of homologous analogs of cephalosporins were proposed by evaluating the performance of five spectral ranges and their combinations, using three data sets of cephalosporins for injection, i. e., cefuroxime sodium, <b>ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium</b> and cefoperazone sodium. Subsequently, the proposed ranges were validated by using eight calibration sets of other homologous analogs of cephalosporins for injection, namely cefmenoxime hydrochloride, ceftezole sodium, cefmetazole, cefoxitin sodium, cefotaxime sodium, cefradine, cephazolin sodium and ceftizoxime sodium. All the constructed quantitative models for the eight kinds of cephalosporins using these universal ranges could fulfill the requirements for quick quantification. After that, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm and infrared (IR) –near infrared (NIR) two-dimensional (2 D) correlation spectral analysis {{were used to determine}} the scientific basis of these two spectral ranges as the universal regions for the construction of quantitative models of cephalosporins. The CARS algorithm demonstrated that the ranges of 4550 – 4100 cm- 1 and 6190 – 5510 cm- 1 included some key wavenumbers which could be attributed to content changes of cephalosporins. The IR–NIR 2 D spectral analysis showed that certain wavenumbers in these two regions have strong correlations to the structures of those cephalosporins that were easy to degrade...|$|E
40|$|Objective　To {{observe the}} effect of Cordyceps sinensis {{mycelium}} on serum vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and substance P (SP) in mice with dysbacteriosis induced by antibiotics. Methods　Forty-eight healthy SPF BALB/c mice were randomly divided into the normal control group (normal drink), the dysbacteriosis model group (induced by oral administration of 0. 5 g/L <b>ceftriaxone</b> <b>sodium),</b> the natural recovery group (oral sterile water to replace antibiotic after reproduction of dysbacteriosis), and Cordyceps sinensis mycelium treatment group (treated by intragastric administration of Cordyceps sinensis mycelium). The feces were collected without contamination, and the change in intestinal bacterial number was observed with the plate dilution method. The volatile fatty acid was detected by chromatography. The serum VIP and SP contents were assayed with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results　Compared with the normal control group, the numbers of probiotics, volatile fatty acids and serum VIP significantly decreased in the model group, while the serum SP markedly increased (P< 0. 01). Compared with the natural recovery group, the bacteria number, the quantities of volatile fatty acids and serum VIP significantly increased after the Cordyceps sinensis mycelium treatment, while the serum SP significantly decreased (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 05). Conclusion　Cordyceps sinensis mycelium may effectively adjust {{the proportion of the}} probiotics in the mice with dysbacteriosis, and the mechanism is apparently related to alteration in the VIP and SP.
