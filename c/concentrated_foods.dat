40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the effect of the use of food {{products}} from family farms on school menus of the school feeding program (SFP) of a municipality in Southern Brazil. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative content analysis was carried out of 16 key informant interviews involved in the SFP, or in agriculture production related to SFP planning, development and supply. The resulting categories were used to construct a quantitative analysis protocol for school menus for three years both prior to and after (n= 130 days) procurement of the SFP with food from family farms. The studied variables were the presence (yes/no) of vegetables, fruits, legumes and <b>concentrated</b> <b>foods.</b> Monthly frequency and contrast of proportions were calculated for each variable during the years studied. Findings – The interviewees recognized that the proximity between food production and the school increased the variety of fresh, natural and organic foods in school menus. The direct supply of the SFP with foods from local family farms resulted in a significant increase (p< 0. 05) in the frequency of vegetables, fruits and legumes in school menus as well as a progressive reduction in <b>concentrated</b> <b>foods.</b> Originality/value – The design of food and agriculture policy increases the availability of healthy foods in school menus and has beneficial results for promoting healthy meals in schools...|$|E
40|$|In the {{provision}} of an adequate supply of nutrients to dairy cows, primary consideration {{must be given to}} the capacity or appetite of the animals for the food offered. This {{is due to the fact}} that appetite, measured in terms of dry matter intake per day, limits the quantity of food (dry matter) that a cow consumes. In feeding bulky roughages to dairy cows, appetite is an important factor to be considered.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Polyphenol-rich {{foods such}} as pomegranate, green tea, {{broccoli}} and turmeric have demonstrated anti-neoplastic effects in laboratory models involving angiogenesis, apoptosis and proliferation. Although some have been investigated in small, phase II studies, this combination has never been evaluated within an adequately powered randomised controlled trial. METHODS: In total, 199 men, average age 74 years, with localised prostate cancer, 60 % managed with primary active surveillance (AS) or 40 % with watchful waiting (WW) following previous interventions, were randomised (2 : 1) to receive an oral capsule containing a blend of pomegranate, green tea, broccoli and turmeric, or an identical placebo for 6 months. RESULTS: The median rise in PSA in the food supplement group (FSG) was 14. 7 % (95 % confidence intervals (CIs) 3. 4 – 36. 7 %), as opposed to 78. 5 % {{in the placebo group}} (PG) (95 % CI 48. 1 – 115. 5 %), difference 63. 8 % (P¼ 0. 0008). In all, 8. 2 % of men in the FSG and 27. 7 % in the PG opted to leave surveillance {{at the end of the}} intervention (w 2 P¼ 0. 014). There were no significant differences within the predetermined subgroups of age, Gleason grade, treatment category or body mass index. There were no differences in cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar, C-reactive protein or adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This study found a significant short-term, favourable effect on the percentage rise in PSA in men managed with AS and WW following ingestion of this well-tolerated, specific blend of <b>concentrated</b> <b>foods.</b> Its influence on decision-making suggests that this intervention is clinically meaningful, but further trials will evaluate longer term clinical effects, and other makers of disease progression...|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} the chief {{objective}} in the rendering of meat {{has been the}} recovery of its fats and oils. In all animals {{there is a very}} large variety of fats and oils and their uses may vary from the production of edible materials such as dripping, margarine and salad dressings to such commonplace things as leather dressings and soap. The tallow produced from the rendering of meat is of great importance in war materials, for from this harmless substance, glycerine is obtained and in turn, is used for the manufacture of many explosives. The so-celled edible tallows or fats are generally produced under different conditions to the inedible and as a result are much more expensive. The oils from animals are also important. tin oil such as neatsfoot oil is regarded as quite a common oil, but little thought is ever given to the tedious processes necessary in its manufacture. When - it ultimately reaches the world's markets, its uses are much greater than one would ever imagine. Today a very large amount of the famous "fish and chips" are fried in neatsfoot oil. The delicate machinery of a spinning mill (either silk or woollen threads) is lubricated with an oil that has neatsfoot oil as its basis. Even the very threads are often lubricated with an emulsified form of neatsfoot oil. The foregoing products have up to comparatively recent years been the chief by-products of the meat rendering industry. When Laws discovered that bones {{could be used as a}} fertilizer, then, another aspect of the industry was opened up and bones were much in demand for soil fertilization purposes. Following this, flesh and blood came to be used to make up a more complete fertilizer. With the discoveries of bacterioligists that various diseases could be transmitted by bones, then sterilization of these bones became necessary. Today all fertilizers of animal origin are sterilized under steam pressures generally in the region of 50 lbs. per square inch. With further progress in studies on the feeding of animals, the meat industry was again called upon to supply important articles. Bones that had previously been used as fertilizer were diverted to other channels and now supply that important compound, calcium phosphate, as a lick or a mixture in the food of animals subject to phosphate deficiency. The next avenue opened up was the protein side of the question. The continual demand for increased production from all animal life has rendered it necessary that high protein foods should be available to animals. Cows that are heavy producers of butter - fat, poultry under intense production and similar branches of agriculture demand a protein concentrate. The meat industry has risen to the occasion and produced a meat meal, liver meal and blood meal with protein percentages as high as 70 %. Originally a protein content of 35. ` in a meat meal was considered quite good, but today the tendency is to aim at 7 u and exceed this mark if possible. One of the chief reasons for this great advance, is, that raw materials producing these "meals",are for the most part low fat bearing offals and a means of getting rid of them, without expensive treatment, has been long sought after. Apart from the foregoing reason, the overseas demand for meat meals, liver meals and such concentrates has increased tremendously in the last two years. Some of the larger rendering companies ship almost their entire out ? to overseas consumers. The Australian consumer has still to be educated to the use of <b>concentrated</b> <b>foods</b> for his animals and when this happens the bones and meat now going into fertilizer will be diverted into animal foods. In England the shank bones from lambs are ground into a special bone meal which is entirely strange to Australia, although its results are far ahead of anything we produce here at present. The meat industry is one in which nothing is wasted and every year sees some new use for one of its many by-products. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
40|$|Intensive {{cultivation}} of avocados {{for commercial purposes}} began in California and Florida and later in Israel, South Africa and Chile. Although a range of avocado cultivars are grown, Hass is the world's most widely-grown and exported cultivar. Avocado fruit has shown good commercial perspectives and planted areas show a tendency to increase. World production of avocado has grown on average 4. 3 % (over 760. 000 MT) between 1988 and 1998. The main producers of avocado are Mexico (34 %), USA (8 %), Dominican Republic (7 %), Indonesia (6 %) Brazil (4 %) and Israel (4 %), Chile (2. 4 %), Spain (3 %) and South Africa (2 %) which during 1997 contributed together to 70 % of the world production. Avocado world trade has increased greatly from 57, 576 tonnes in 1980 to 238, 306 tonnes in 1997. In 1997, the main players in the export market were Israel, Mexico, South Africa, USA and Chile. The main importers of this fruit were in Europe: Belgium, France, The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and in America: the USA and Canada and in Asia: Japan {{has emerged as a}} strong market since 1995. Average prices paid per metric ton have decreased over the years as higher volumes of fruit are traded and new exporters enter into the business. Avocado producer countries will face major challenges because of increasing production and low prices over the short and medium term. With the exception of Mexico, Israel and the U. S. the rest of the studied country producers are fairly new in the industry, thus, they possess great potential for growing. In New Zealand avocados are mainly cultivated in the North Island specifically in the Bay of Plenty and Northland areas. The New Zealand avocado Industry is based on the Hass cultivar. Avocado trees in New Zealand continue to be widely planted and with the entrance of new growers, in the future, the orchard area will continue to increase. The avocado industry in New Zealand is export driven. New Zealand's main export markets are Australia and recently the United States. Actual Australian market dominance by New Zealand would be reduced in the following 5 years due to a constant increase in Australian domestic avocado production. Since 1996, the U. S. has become an important market of destination for New Zealand avocados. Traditional supplier of the U. S. market has been Chile and it represents New Zealand's main competitor In avocado export leader countries usually the local market is supplied with fruit that does not meet export (usually strict) quality requirements. Great increases in production and export volumes are expected, therefore, it is forecast that large volumes of low price rated avocados would exist and would force the industry to look for alternative uses for avocados. Those avocados rejected during classification for export markets mainly due to defects in cosmetic appearance might be used for avocado oil extraction. The oil industry generally considered a by- product of the fresh fruit industry. For the multiplicity of applications and high prices that it achieves, avocado oil represents an interesting industry that should be further researched. Lipids {{are an important part of}} the composition of avocado fruit for a range of reasons. They contribute significantly to the taste of the fruit, and are used indirectly as a means of defining maturity since they correlate highly with dry matter. Although there has been some work carried out in New Zealand examining lipid changes and maturity, there has been no examination of the fatty acid makeup of the lipids, how they vary between regions, and what the lipid content is later in a commercial season. Such information is important from a fruit quality, health and marketing points of view. On seven occasions between September 1998 and April 1999, fruit from two orchards located in Te Puke and the Far North were harvested and analysed for dry matter, lipid content and fatty acid composition. Dry matter assessments were carried out using the commercial method and, the lipid fraction was extracted using a modification of the Bligh and Dyer technique. Later, the fatty acid analysis of the lipids was carried out by gas chromatography. Average dry matter increased over the period of study (September to April). Dry matter for Te Puke fruit increased from 24. 6 % to 36. 4 %, while dry matter from the Far North fruit increased from 24. 1 % to 32. 3 % over the same period of time. Total lipid content increased from 17. 2 % to 31. 3 % in Te Puke and from 16. 4 % to 26. 7 % in the Far North from September to April. The results imply that fruit from Te Puke could be preferred from the point of view of oil extraction because higher yields can be obtained than from fruit from the Far North. It was found a high and positive relationship exists between total lipids and dry matter content in avocados. During the study period, fruit from Te Puke showed consistently higher lipid content (and dry matter content) than fruit from the Far North. At both sites, the beneficial monounsaturated oleic acid was the major fatty acid synthesised, however, fruit from Te Puke showed higher levels of oleic acid than fruit from the Far North. From the nutrition point of view the ratio of monounsaturated (oleic and palmitoleic acid) to saturated fatty acids (palmitic acid) and the ratio of polyunsaturated (linoleic and linolenic acid) to saturated fatty acids found for the Far North and Te Puke regions compare favourably with those of the recommended olive oil. Due to similarities in lipid composition between olive oil and avocado oil, it can be implied that the high concentration of monounsaturated fatty acids in avocado will be beneficial to lower blood lipids as olive oil does. The food industry makes use of avocado oil to prepare <b>concentrated</b> <b>foods,</b> while the cosmetics industry prepares lotions and soaps for hair and skin treatments. Lastly, prestigious laboratories are also analysing the property of the flesh and oil for medical purposes. The information compiled here confirms that avocado oil compares to olive oil and can be regarded as a high- value product from the nutritional and the commercial point of view. On current production trends in New Zealand, the likelihood of an oil-extraction plant is not remote. An oil industry in New Zealand would benefit the growers because it will absorb the surplus of avocados in the local market that otherwise would compete with their first grade fruit...|$|E

However, though sex, size, age, and individual variation are speculated to be factors in establishing dominance over a <b>concentrated</b> <b>food</b> source, the bases {{for the establishment of}} dominance over <b>concentrated</b> <b>food</b> sources in Tamias striatus remains questionable. This study tested the hypothesis that: When a <b>concentrated</b> <b>food</b> source is placed equidistant from two or more chipmunk burrows, dominace over the food source will be established based on {{one or more of the}} following: first individual to encounter the food source, sex, and/or size (weight). After testing 6 sets of interactions with 6 chipmunks each, it was found that although aggression varied significantly with weight difference between winner and loser (p<. 05), a linear relationship did not exist. As interactors got closer in weight, intensity of aggression did not increase. Because only one chipmunk of the 6 was male, any correlation between sex and dominance could not be examined. In addition, because the sample size was so limited, any correlation between first individual to encounter the food source could not be examined. Overall, much aggressive behavior might be attributable to individual variation. Future studies might increase sample size and would further contribute to our knowledge of the bases for dominance in chipmunks...|$|R
