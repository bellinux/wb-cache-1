I {{said you}} don't believe that bullshit. He said, 'I damn sure do!' [...] one day when I started to leave, Ruby shook hands with me and I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> {{piece of paper in}} his palm… [...] {{he said it was a}} conspiracy and he said … if you will keep your eyes open and your mouth shut, you're gonna learn a lot. And that was the last letter I ever got from him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary colors}} of the Lancaster Barnstormers are red, black, khaki, and white. These {{are similar to the}} colors used by the Red Roses, {{representing}} a conscious effort to connect {{the past and the present}} of Lancaster County baseball. The primary logo consists of a typical red barn outlined in black with a curving baseball. Unlike most sports logos, the geographical location is prominently featured rather than the team nickname. Team management decided to emphasize the Lancaster community so that the whole county <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> sense of ownership and pride. In 2011, the Barnstormers substituted black for navy blue and unveiled three agriculture-themed alternate logos: a hex sign, a weather vane, and the barn-planked [...] "LB" [...] initials. The [...] "hex-sign" [...] logo incorporates the team's initials and a Pennsylvania Dutch design complete with a baseball and two crossed bats. Additionally, it includes two red roses symbolizing Lancaster's nickname, [...] "Red Rose City." ...|$|E

2500|$|Murakami's initial {{success with}} Hear the Wind Sing {{encouraged}} him to continue writing. A year later, he published a sequel, Pinball, 1973. In 1982, he published A Wild Sheep Chase, a critical success. Hear the Wind Sing, Pinball, 1973, and A Wild Sheep Chase form the Trilogy of the Rat (a sequel, Dance, Dance, Dance, was written later but is not {{considered part of the}} series), centered on the same unnamed narrator and his friend, [...] "the Rat." [...] The first two novels were not widely available in English translation outside Japan until 2015, although an English edition, translated by Alfred Birnbaum with extensive notes, had been published by Kodansha as part of a series intended for Japanese students of English. Murakami considers his first two novels to be [...] "immature" [...] and [...] "flimsy," [...] and has not been eager to have them translated into English. A Wild Sheep Chase, he says, was [...] "the first book where I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> kind of sensation, the joy of telling a story. When you read a good story, you just keep reading. When I write a good story, I just keep writing." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{sat up in}} the {{darkness}} and nursed his knees. The progress of the airship was not nearly so smooth as a balloon; he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> regular swaying up, up, up and then down, down, down, and the throbbing and tremulous quiver of the engines.|$|E

60|$|Finding {{that there}} was nothing for him to do, Reuben again turned in. The motion was still tremendous, but he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> {{sensible}} change from what it was before. The motion of the ship was less sudden and violent and, although she rolled tremendously, she rose each time with an easier motion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me {{shake it}} for you," [...] said Tom, and both {{brothers}} went to work, but with small success. The arm hung down as limp as a rag, {{and the left}} leg was nearly as badly off, although Dick said he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> slight sensation in it, like so many needles sticking him.|$|E
60|$|Euchre's narrow eyes twinkled, and he {{gave the}} dough he was rolling a slap with his flour-whitened hand. Manifestly he had proclaimed himself a {{champion}} and partner of Duane's, with all the pride <b>an</b> old man <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> in <b>a</b> young one whom he admired.|$|R
5000|$|Simpson and his wife, {{the former}} Lynne Alice Livingston left Laramie around 2011 {{to return to}} Cody. Their younger son, Peter K.

In 2010, he appeared at UW as Prince Hamlet in a theatre production of the Shakespearean play, with Pete Simpson cast as the Ghost of Hamlet's father. The junior Simpson recalls, with [...] "the ghost and son scene, ... I <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>an</b> energy shift in the room. It {{was hard not to}} get misty eyed." ...|$|R

60|$|In all {{the talk}} of the circus which {{followed}} among her companions, she took no part because she feared she might be obliged to mention his name.

But, with my manners and accomplishments, the thing is, of course, out of the question. We all know that a lady has no passions." ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a design study that {{describes}} how we used a web-based bulletin board system to support children who suffer from cystic fibrosis. Their illness tends {{to make them feel}} socially isolated, and face-to-face group meetings are not possible, and hence we looked to the internet to provide a suitable infrastructure for us to build a supportive community dedicated to this patient group, which could provide support, information and a social meeting place of which they <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>an</b> important part of. We discuss the design issues that faced us in trying to create such a community for this group of users...|$|R

6000|$|Rollo held very still, {{while his}} father struck the string; and {{immediately}} afterwards he called out, [...] "Yes, sir."

60|$|He nodded again, {{feeling the}} full {{comfort of the}} kitchen, the {{presence}} of his plump, attractive wife, the breakfast dishes and coffee. This was relaxation. And the war news was good, good and satisfying. He <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> justifiable glow at the news, {{a sense of pride}} and personal accomplishment. After all, he {{was an integral part of}} the war program, not just another factory worker lugging a cart of scrap, but a technician, one of those who designed and planned the nerve-trunk of the war.|$|E
6000|$|... "I must," [...] said Uncle Geoffrey. [...] "Nothing but {{the most}} {{absolute}} necessity could make me leave you now.

50|$|Ranade {{believed}} {{that as the}} Vivekananda Rock Memorial was a national monument, every Indian should be invited to contribute to its construction.

60|$|More days--and {{she could}} speak to the nurse at her bedside; she could answer the {{questions}} of an elderly man, who knew far more about her than she knew about herself, and who {{told her he was}} Mr. Merrick, the doctor; she could sit up in bed, supported by pillows, wondering what had happened to her, and where she was; she <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> growing curiosity about that quiet voice, which still asked after her, morning, noon, and night, {{on the other side of}} the door.|$|E
60|$|Nobody spoke. Thornton's bluff, if bluff it was, {{had been}} called. He <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> flush of warm blood {{creeping}} up his face. His tongue had tricked him.

He had great faith in Buck's strength and had often thought him capable of starting such a load; but never, as now, had he faced the possibility of it, the eyes of a dozen men fixed upon him, silent and waiting. Further, he had no thousand dollars; nor had Hans or Pete.|$|E
60|$|From {{the prisoners}} Captain Jacot {{permitted}} {{his mind to}} traverse the remaining miles of sand to the little garrison post where, upon the morrow, he should find awaiting him with eager welcome his wife and little daughter. His eyes softened {{to the memory of}} them, as they always did. Even now he could see the beauty of the mother reflected in the childish lines of little Jeanne's face, and both those faces would be smiling up into his as he swung from his tired mount late the following afternoon. Already he <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> soft cheek pressed close to each of his--velvet against leather.|$|E
