Because of the small value of the ratios cutting depth to cutting edge radius and cutting depth to characteristic microstructural dimensions, one may expect that the extensive technological data base available for conventional metal cutting, may not directly transfer to micromilling and that size effects will influence the <b>cutting</b> <b>pressures</b> in micromilling as compared to those in macromilling. To address this issue, we have developed a micro-orthogonal cutting test facility in which chip thickness can be controlled to within a few microns and cutting forces can be measured.

Besides measuring specific <b>cutting</b> <b>pressures,</b> we also aim at identifying mechanisms of chip formation and how they are affected by microstructure, fracture damage accumulation and microtool geometry.

In this study, cuttings transport simulations were carried out for inclinations from 45 ° to 90 °, for pipe rotation speeds from 80 to 240  rpm, and for flow rates from 30 to 50  L/s. Annular <b>cuttings</b> volume, <b>pressure</b> drop, and <b>cuttings</b> distribution are recorded simultaneously within the simulation proceeding. The CFD simulations show that pipe rotation makes cuttings presented in asymmetric distribution along the wellbore and significantly improves the drag effects on drilling fluid in the tangential direction.

However, there is no additional contribution of pipe rotation after reaching critical speed at high flow rates.
