At around 03:15 on 22 June 1941, the Axis Powers commenced {{the invasion of}} the Soviet Union with the bombing of major cities in Soviet-occupied Poland and an artillery barrage on Red Army defences on the entire front. Air-raids were conducted as far as Kronstadt near Leningrad, Ismail in Bessarabia, and Sevastopol in the Crimea. Meanwhile, ground troops crossed the border, accompanied in some locales by Lithuanian and Ukrainian fifth columnists. Roughly three million soldiers of the Wehrmacht went into action and faced slightly fewer Soviet troops at the border.|$|E

Durham was the <b>codeword</b> for the operations which {{to a large extent}} consisted of distributing flyers, brochures and posters with the purpose of demoralising the Germans. This was also the topic in Psykologisk krigføring i Norge under Annen Verdenskrig 1940-45, published in 1994.

40|$|The {{study of}} minimal <b>codewords</b> in linear codes was {{motivated}} by Massey who described how minimal <b>codewords</b> of a linear code define access structures for secret sharing schemes. As a consequence of his article, Borissov, Manev, and Nikova initiated the study of minimal <b>codewords</b> in the binary Reed-Muller codes. They counted the number of non-minimal <b>codewords</b> of weight 2 d in the binary Reed-Muller codes RM(r, in), and also gave results on the non-minimality of <b>codewords</b> of large weight in the binary Reed-Muller codes RM(r, in). The results of Borissov, Manev, and Nikova regarding the counting {{of the number of}} non-minimal <b>codewords</b> of small weight in RM(r,m) were improved by Schillewaert, Storme, and Thas who counted the number of non-minimal <b>codewords</b> of weight smaller than 3 d in RM(r,m).

5|$|On 5June 1944, {{the company}} made final {{preparations}} for the mission. Each man was issued their personal weapons and ammunition as well as up to nine hand grenades and four Bren gun magazines. Each platoon also had a 2-inch mortar and a radio. Just before the men boarded the gliders, codewords were issued. 'Ham' indicated the canal bridge was captured and 'Jam' the river bridge. Capture and destruction of the canal bridge would be signalled using the <b>codeword</b> 'Jack'; 'Lard' would be used if a similar fate befell the river bridge.|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA <b>codeword</b> so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E
5|$|By October 6 the Egyptian naval {{task force}} was at Bab-el-Mandeb where they broke radio silence. When Operation Badr began at 14:00, Rear Admiral Fuad Abu Zikry {{authorized}} the fleet {{to proceed with}} the blockade via a <b>codeword.</b> Egyptian submarines and destroyers intercepted ships traveling through Bab-el-Mandeb destined for Eilat, and all Israeli maritime navigation in the Red Sea ceased. The blockade was a strategic success for Egypt, while the Israeli Navy and Air Force were incapable of lifting the blockade due to the long distance between Israel and Bab-el-Mandeb. Mines were laid {{at the entrance to the}} Gulf of Suez to prevent Israel from transporting oil from the Sinai fields to Eilat. Historian Gammal Hammad claims that a blockade was also enforced in the Mediterranean, while other sources dispute this. News of the blockade was censored in Israel.|$|E

25|$|Bipartite graphs are {{extensively}} used {{in modern}} coding theory, especially to decode codewords {{received from the}} channel. Factor graphs and Tanner graphs are examples of this. A Tanner graph is a bipartite graph in which the vertices {{on one side of}} the bipartition represent digits of a <b>codeword,</b> and the vertices on the other side represent combinations of digits that are expected to sum to zero in a <b>codeword</b> without errors. A factor graph is a closely related belief network used for probabilistic decoding of LDPC and turbo codes.|$|E

40|$|Audio Video Coding Standard (AVS) is the {{emerging}} video standard in which 2 -dimensional context adaptive variable length coding (C 2 DVLC) is used. The main difference be-tween context adaptive variable length coding (CAVLC) of H. 264 /AVC and C 2 DVLC of AVS from selective encryp-tion {{point of view}} is that C 2 DVLC <b>codewords</b> are not con-tiguous and do not use the full code-space.

25|$|The story follows {{six people}} on a routine flight {{of the space shuttle}} Odyssey, on August 7, 2007: four astronauts, a scientist, and a {{television}} news reporter. During the flight, the Earth rapidly dissolves into a fiery ball and implodes. Control of the Odyssey is momentarily lost, and one astronaut is killed. The remaining five crew members resign themselves to death, but an inorganic being called the Seeker rescues them. The Seeker tells them that fifty other worlds have been destroyed {{in the same way as}} Earth, and the Seeker has always arrived too late to observe it; this is the first time he has found survivors. He offers to send them five years into the past (to 2002, the year the series aired), so that they can prevent the disaster. He sends only their consciousnesses back, because physical time travel is impossible. The mission commander learns a <b>codeword</b> associated with the disaster: Leviathan.|$|E

40|$|T-Codes are a {{class of}} variable-length codes. Their {{self-synchronisation}} properties are useful in compression and communication applications where error recovery rather than error correction is at issue, for example, in digital telephony.
