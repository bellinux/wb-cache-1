He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like <b>cork-oak,</b> but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E

5000|$|The {{region is}} the home of the world's most {{important}} area for the growing of cork. <b>Cork-oak,</b> known in Portugal as [...] "sobreiro", has been grown commercially in the region for the past 300 years, with the areas between the trees typically given over to grazing, or on the more productive soils, to the growing of citrus fruit, vines or olives. As a consequence, a uniquely rich and varied ecosystem has developed. The bark of the <b>cork-oak</b> is still harvested by teams of men using locally made hand-axes. No mechanical method has yet been invented that will allow the harvest to be achieved as effectively. The stripping of the bark is performed only in mid-Summer, when the bark can be removed more easily. The <b>cork-oak</b> is the only tree known that will allow this regular stripping of bark without damage. The harvest of one mature tree provides sufficient bark to produce about 4,000 wine bottle corks. The industry provides employment for about 60,000 workers.|$|E

The seasonal progression of phenological events was analyzed in seven trees. Selected branches were examined monthly for shoot elongation, leaf number, branching, flowering, and fruiting. Radial stem growth and specific leaf weight were also studied. Active growth was observed from early spring to early summer. Reserves accumulated during winter and high photosynthetic activity in early spring apparently supported this strong development. The growth flush started with stem radial increment, {{which seemed to be}} impaired by spring rainfall. Male inflorescence production was the next phenological event. Old leaves were shed during new twig and leaf emergence. Shoot elongation and the number of new leaves produced were well correlated with the previous-year shoot's length, and were not clearly related to climatic factors. Radial growth resumed in autumn at a lower rate than in the previous spring, a possible consequence of a reserve depletion due to lower photosynthetic production in summer and investment on fruit maturation, which was complete by late autumn. Premature and excessive new leaf production were apparently subjected to self-pruning strategies related to the development of each tree's crown. Younger <b>cork-oaks</b> produced shorter and fewer shoots per module, and more sclerophyllous leaves than the older ones. A high intra-specific variability was observed in all the results...|$|R

40|$|Land-use {{intensification}} in Mediterranean agro-forest systems {{became a}} pressure on biodiversity, concerning particularly the woodland sensitive species. In 2001, {{the effects of}} a land-use gradient from old-growth <b>cork-oak</b> forest to a homogeneous agricultural area were assessed using rove beetles as indicators in a Mediterranean landscape. The aim was to find which species were negatively affected by land-use intensification at the landscape level and whether they benefited from <b>cork-oak</b> patches occurring along the land-use gradient. A total of 3, 196 rove beetles from 88 taxa were sampled from all landscape types. Agricultural area recorded significantly higher numbers of abundance and species richness in relation to the <b>cork-oak</b> mosaics, i. e. the old-growth forest and the managed agro-forest landscapes (montados). Moreover, 70 % of rove beetle indicator species common enough to be tested by IndVal displayed their highest indicator value for agriculture, showing a lower number of woodland indicators in comparison to ground beetles. Nevertheless, one rove beetle taxon was considered a specialist of closed woodland mosaics while no specialist ground beetle was found for that landscape typology. Some rare rove beetle species were also important in typifying diversity patterns of oldgrowth <b>cork-oak</b> forests. Hence, future management in Mediterranean landscapes should take into account not only indicator species common enough to be tested by IndVal, but also rare and endemic species. Considering the added value of <b>cork-oak</b> woodland cover for sensitive rove and ground beetle diversity, the strengthening of <b>cork-oak</b> woodland connectivity seems to be a crucial management that is required in agricultural Mediterranean landscapes.

The Collembola community in the overall area was dominated by a few abundant species, mainly Isotomidae, present in almost all units. Abundance, diversity and species richness decreased along the gradient, with the agricultural site presenting an impoverished community. Diversity descriptors were positively and significantly correlated with habitat diversity, measured {{on the basis of}} the proportion of the different soil-use types present at each land-use unit. Multivariate analysis revealed changes in Collembola community composition between the LUUs, with LUU 6 detaching from the rest. LUU 1 and LUU 2, despite the less diverse community of the latter, formed a separate group from the remaining two units (LUU 3 and LUU 5).

40|$|Cork oak (Quercus suber) {{forests are}} unique in being largely anthropogenic, and {{representing}} both {{an important source}} of income and a great reservoir of biodiversity. Because of changes in the Mediterranean climate and developments in the way farming is conducted, the semi-natural <b>cork-oak</b> forests have become ecologically fragile and more susceptible to pathogens. There is evidence that climate is selecting for thermophilic or thermotolerant pathogen strains that produce a larger biomass. A high infectivity (massive propagule pressure) is a major determinant in the spread of pathogens to as yet uncontaminated areas. We describe the role and effect of these pathogens with the aim to identify strategies for curtailing diseases and safeguarding the forests.

This study {{compares the}} epiphytic lichen floras of <b>cork-oak</b> forests from eastern Spain. The {{methodology}} was designed {{in such a}} way as to avoid subjectivity at all stages, from the sampling protocol to data analysis. Field work was carried out in 15 Catalonian localities, in mature stands of Carici-Querco suberis sigmetum, and in 9 localities of the Valencian Cornmunity, in mature stands of Asplenio-Querco suberis sigmetum. In each locality, ten trees were selected, and the lichens growing on virgin bark from 50 to 200 cm above the ground were identified. Ali together, 153 species were encountered, with 69 species present in both territories, and 33 found in at least three samplig plots. Multivariate methods of classification and ordination were used to analyze a matrix of stations and species based on presence/absence data. The classification clearly separated two main groups of stations, Catalonian and Valencian, with the exception of two Catalonian localities that were more related to the Valencian ones. This accords well with the climate of the two regions: the Catalonian <b>cork-oak</b> forests are subjected to a strong maritime influence, experiencing frequent fog episodes, whereas the Valencian ones are more continental and drier. The higher incidence of nitrophytic lichens in the Valencian <b>cork-oak</b> forests is probably due to dust accumulation on the trunks.

The geological and phytoclimatic heterogeneity of the island and the wide ecological amplitude of the holm-oak, result in a large phytocoenotic diversity of the Sardinian holm-oak woods. These are referred to five associations: Pyro amygdaliformis-Quercetum ilicis, Prasio majoris-Quercetum ilicis ass. nova, Galio scabri-Quercetum ilicis, Saniculo europaeae-Quercetum ilicis ass. nova and Aceri monspessulani-Quercetum ilicis.

Glycerol was shown {{to be one of}} the main monomers released from suberin, 14 % in <b>Cork-oak,</b> 26 % in Douglas-fir. The use of calibrated standards showed that #alpha#, #omega#-diacids, comparatively to #omega#-hydroxy acids, exist in bigger proportions than reported earlier. A partial depolymerization by CaO-catalyzed methanolysis was applied to both corks, solubilizing about 4 % of the suberins. Ca. 30 % of these mixtures were dimers of two types, monoacylglycerols of suberinic acids and feruloyil esters of - hydroxyacids. The mixtures were separated and quantified by GC-MS and dimers identified by interpretation of their mass spectra or after the synthesis of the compounds.

In this work, trees from sites with different managements were studied for 3 – 6 years. Radial increments were enhanced following harvesting (4. 0 – 8. 2 mmyr– 1), and decreased afterwards (< 4. 3 mmyr– 1). Time after harvesting was the primary factor affecting radial growth of Q. suber, but trunk growth also correlated negatively with Autumn-Winter precipitations and minimum temperatures, and positively with Spring rainfall. Spring radial increment varied significantly between sites...|$|E
40|$|Context: The role of {{ecological}} processes governing community structure {{are dependent on}} the spatial distances among local communities {{and the degree of}} habitat heterogeneity at a given spatial scale. Also, they depend on the dispersal ability of the targeted organisms collected throughout a landscape window. Objectives: We assessed the relative importance of spatial and environmental factors shaping edaphic (Collembola) and epigeous (Carabidae) communities at different scales. Methods: The sampling sites were four different landscape windows (1 km 2 square each) in a Mediterranean <b>cork-oak</b> landscape in Portugal. Variance partitioning methods were used to disentangle the relative effects of spatial variables and environmental variables (habitat: data on % of vegetation cover types; management: data on forestry and pasture interventions; landscape: data on landscape metrics e. g., patch size, shape and configuration) across different spatial scales. Results: The relative effects of environmental and spatial factors at different scales varied between Collembola and Carabidae. The pure effect of the environmental component was only significant for carabid beetles and explained a higher percentage of their community variance compared to collembolan communities. The pure effects of the spatial component were generally higher than the environmental component for both groups of soil fauna. Carabid communities responded to landscape features related to the patch connectivity of open areas (grasslands) as well as the shape of <b>cork-oak</b> habitat patches integrating the agro-forest mosaic. Conclusions: Community patterns of surface-dwelling soil fauna may be partly predicted by some features of the landscape, while soil-dwelling communities require ecological assessments at finer spatial scales...|$|E

Angiosperm considers a large variety of broad-leaved trees and shrubs including oak and grapevine. Grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is considered the most important fruit plant throughout the world, thus much proteomic research has been conducted in the last decade on this species (reviewed in Giribaldi and Giuffrida 2010). Cork Oak (Quercus suber L.) is a Mediterranean forest species with a remarkable ecological, social and economic value. Cork production from <b>cork-oak</b> supports an industry of economic and social relevance in Mediterranean countries, but few proteomic studies have been conducted (Gómez et al. 2009;Ricardo et al. 2011).|$|E

The research aims to provide an empirical contribution to the knowledge about the economic benefits deriving from fire protection of forest ecosystems. A case study is presented where we measured the TEV of reducing fire hazards to a <b>cork-oak</b> forest localised in a Sicilian protected area, using a dichotomous choice question in a Contingent Valuation Study. The magnitudes of the annual aggregate WTP estimates obtained range from € 32, 745 to € 42, 953, corrispondent to € 712 and € 934 per hectare, {{in order to protect}} the forest from fires, and are an evidence of the little interest of local community in the forest ecosystem protection...|$|E
40|$|During the {{biennium}} 2009 - 2010, {{a survey}} on the pest status of some ant species {{was conducted in}} some <b>cork-oak</b> stands of the North of Sardinia. In the first year 5 species of arboricolous ants were collected by direct sampling {{from a number of}} trees randomly chosen. Although they are not very common species, workers of Camponotus fallax (Nylander, 1856) and Camponotus truncatus (Spinola, 1808) were collected inside little twigs and in other refuges. Crematogaster scutellaris (Olivier, 1792) was the most common species as its presence was detected in every tree. Camponotus vagus (Scopoli, 1763) was observed primarily in old trees and in rotten wood among roots and its pest status has not been seen yet as it rarely builds its nest in productive trees. Serious damages caused by Lasius brunneus (Latreille, 1798) were observed on cork bark of young plants...|$|E
40|$|Maâmora is {{considered}} the most important <b>cork-oak</b> forest {{in the world with}} regard to surface. Therefore, anthropic pressure, including cork harvesting, grazing and soft acorn picking up by lo-cal communities, has harmful consequences on forest regeneration and the forest become older exceeding harvesting age. Thus, its sustainability depends on the managers ’ ability to succeed cork oak plantations. This work presents an assessment approach to evaluate Quercus suber suitability to its plantation which is based on a random forest algorithm (RF). In fact, this suitability has been assessed through analyzing management data related to previous plantation success rates (SR). Then a relationship between SR and a set of environmental and social factors has been investi-gated using the RF. Application of the fitted model to continuous maps of all involved factors enabled establishment of suitability maps which would help managers to make more rational de...|$|E
40|$|Procedures {{have been}} {{developed}} to standardize the multiplication stage during mature <b>cork-oak</b> (Quercus suber L.) micropropagation. Axillary and terminal buds were established on Gresshoff and Doy basal medium containing 1 mg I− 1 of 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP). Initiation of cultures was possible all over the year. The effects of BAP, Z, IBA, 1 AA and NAA and various nutrient formulae on shoot growth and proliferation was investigated. BAP was more suitable than zeatin. Shoot proliferation and elongation were strongly improved by the combination BAP/IAA in the presence of low salt media, like Gresshoff and Doy or Woody Plant medium. Both rates were significantly increased when a double-phase culture system was used. Shoots have been multiplied for 1 year at the rate of three to four-fold every 4 weeks without any decline of vigour. Rooting was achieved by briefly dipping the basal ends of in vitro regenerated shoots in an IBA concentrated solution. The results here reported constitute a promising step towards large scale in vitro propagation of a species in which conventional vegetative propagation by cuttings is very difficult...|$|E
