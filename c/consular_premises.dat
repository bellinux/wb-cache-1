25|$|The {{primary mission}} of the MSG is to provide security, {{particularly}} the protection of classified information and equipment vital {{to the national security}} of the United States at American diplomatic posts. This is accomplished under the guidance and operational control of a civilian federal agent of the Diplomatic Security Service, known as the Regional Security Officer (RSO) who is the senior U.S. law enforcement representative and security attaché at U.S. diplomatic posts around the world. In addition, MSGs provide security for visiting American dignitaries and frequently assist the RSO in supervising host country or locally employed security forces that provide additional security for the exterior of embassies. The MSGs fall under operational control of the RSO and are administratively controlled by the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group. The secondary mission of Marine Security Guards is to provide protection for U.S. citizens and U.S. Government property located within designated U.S. Diplomatic and <b>Consular</b> <b>premises</b> during exigent circumstances, which require immediate aid or action.|$|E
50|$|Iraqi {{soldiers}} {{entered the}} diplomatic missions of some European and Arab nations, abducting several personnel and expelling others. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council demanded the immediate release of foreign nationals {{as well as}} all nationals mentioned in Resolution 664, reminding it of its international obligations according to the Vienna Conventions. It also asked Iraq to protect the safety and well-being of diplomatic and <b>consular</b> staff and <b>premises</b> in Kuwait, and to take no action that would hinder their diplomatic functions, including access for their nationals to the premises.|$|R
5000|$|In September, the {{government}} of Canada declared {{that it would not}} allow Tunisia to open polling stations in its territory because it refused to be included in another country's electoral constituency. Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird called the issue [...] "a matter of Canadian sovereignty". In response to Canada's opposition, Tunisia threatened to refuse to allow Canadian observers to monitor the election, but later reversed its decision and decided to accredit them. On 18 October, an agreement was reached between the two countries to allow Tunisians to cast their vote in Ottawa, at the Tunisian embassy's <b>consular</b> and diplomatic <b>premises,</b> and in Montreal, at the consulate and at a Tunisian community center.|$|R

5000|$|The British {{government}} had suggested it could use its discretionary powers under the Diplomatic and <b>Consular</b> <b>Premises</b> Act 1987 {{to enter the}} embassy and arrest Assange after giving the embassy due notice. However, it later retracted the suggestion, following condemnation from Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patiño and President Rafael Correa. Patiño described the British government's statement as [...] "a clear breach {{of international law and}} the protocols set out in the Vienna Convention." ...|$|E

The Department of Foreign Affairs {{released}} {{a statement saying that}} the Philippines is [...] "outraged by the horrific criminal and senseless act of violence in Benghazi which should be condemned by the international community". The statement also stresses that the attacks were a [...] "serious violation of long standing norms of international law" [...] and reiterated that [...] "diplomatic and consular agents should not be harmed and that the diplomatic and <b>consular</b> <b>premises</b> are inviolable". The Philippines also extended condolences to the U.S. Ambassador, the embassy staff and their families. The Philippine National Police has stepped up additional security for American diplomatic facilities.|$|E

50|$|Section 36(3) further authorises the Chief Executive {{to exempt}} any {{tenement}} {{or part of}} any tenement from the payment of rates, wholly or in part. This exemption provision is limited to particular tenements, and not classes of tenements. This provision {{is used for the}} exemption of <b>consular</b> <b>premises</b> and residences of accredited consular officers, as well as certain village houses situated outside designated village areas in the New Territories and occupied by an indigenous villager. The rates concession granted to all tenements in Hong Kong for the period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002 and the additional concession for the period 1 April 2002 to 31 December 2002 were also made under this subsection.|$|E
50|$|The law {{has only}} been used once, for the Cambodian embassy in London, which had been {{occupied}} by squatters. The embassy had {{been used by the}} Government of Cambodia before it was overthrown by Pol Pot in 1975. Whilst that government was recognised by Britain, no diplomatic mission was established before Cambodia was invaded by Vietnam in 1978, and the building came into the care of the British Foreign Office. The squatters moved in whilst the embassy was vacant in 1976, and in 1988 they would have gained title to the building following twelve years of continuous occupation. Hence an order was made, the Diplomatic and <b>Consular</b> <b>Premises</b> (Cambodia) Order 1988, to de-recognise the diplomatic premises so that legal action could be taken to remove the squatters.|$|E

40|$|Some of {{the most}} heated events related to the 2017 Turkish referendum, which {{significantly}} amended the country's constitution, {{did not take place}} in Turkey but in several European countries where a large number of Turkish citizens reside. The tension escalated when the Netherlands barred a plane carrying the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs from landing on Dutch soil and then prevented the Turkish Family and Social Policies Minister from accessing the Turkish Consulate in Rotterdam. This triggered what has been described as an unprecedented diplomatic crisis between two NATO allies. Turkey vigorously claimed that the Netherlands' behaviour breached the law of diplomatic and consular relations. The Netherlands, in turn, defended its actions, stating that they did not amount to a violation of international law. The present article will first provide an overview of these events and introduce the claims that were made by each side. Secondly, this article will briefly analyse the relevant treaty provisions and customary rules to ascertain whether Foreign Ministers enjoy a special status while visiting a third country and whether <b>consular</b> <b>premises</b> can legitimately be used to carry out political activities, ultimately challenging Turkey’s claims that the Netherlands violated international law...|$|E
40|$|How does {{international}} law require States acting outside their own territories to treat refugees and other persons fleeing harm in their countries? 1 This question has assumed increasing contemporary relevance {{in light of}} heightened externalised border controls, such as attempts by States to interdict migrant boats {{on the high seas}} in the Mediterranean (see, for instance Moreno-Lax 2012). However, the issue also arises in other contemporary scenarios, such as where persons seek protection in diplomatic or <b>consular</b> <b>premises,</b> where one State militarily occupies the territory of another, and where a State sets up a system for the extraterritorial processing of asylum claims. This short analysis addresses the non-refoulement aspect of this extraterritoriality problem, i. e. protection against enforced removal to a territory where the person fears harm by a State acting outside its own territory. Inspired by the human rights focus of the volume overall, the chapter draws on current research by the author in order to examine this ever-topical concern against recent advances in the field of international human rights law. It not only confirms the view that the non-refoulement rule in human rights law applies extraterritorially, but also concludes that the resulting procedural implications should be taken seriously both for human rights law and for refugee la...|$|E
