25|$|Among {{the first}} mixed cuts was the Barion cut, {{introduced}} in 1971. Invented by South African diamond cutter Basil Watermeyer and named after {{himself and his}} wife Marion, the basic Barion cut is an octagonal square or rectangle, with a polished and faceted girdle. The total facet count is 62 (excluding the culet): 25 on the crown; 29 on the pavilion; and 8 on the girdle. This cut can be easily identified by the characteristic central <b>cross</b> <b>pattern</b> (as seen through the table) created by the pavilion facets, {{as well as by}} the crescent-shaped facets on the pavilion. A similar cut is the Radiant cut: It differs in having a total of 70 facets. Both it and the Barion cut exist in a large number of modified forms, with slightly different facet arrangements and combinations.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of the Battle of Murfreesboro, the 4th Arkansas had been issued McCown Style battle flag. This was a {{moderately}} rectangular banner with a predominantly blue field. The field was crossed with a white St. Andrew's Cross and the entire flag was bordered in white. From battle descriptions it is likely that every regiment of McNair's Arkansas Brigade carried a similar flag. Only one of these flags survived the war, that of the 25th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, which was then known as the 30th Arkansas. The flag of the 25th/30th Arkansas was captured after the color bearer's hand was shot off. It is now in the Old State House Museum in Little Rock. The 4th Arkansas would have carried a similar flag, either with their own markings, or with none at all. There are several post war illustrations of a 4th Arkansas Flag based on the St. Andrew's <b>cross</b> <b>pattern</b> of the Army of Tennessee, but no flag of the 4th Arkansas survived the war.|$|E

500|$|While {{there were}} other {{suggestions}} for the new flag for West Germany, the final choice was between two designs, both using black-red-gold. The Social Democrats proposed the re-introduction of the old Weimar flag, while the conservative parties such as the CDU/CSU and the German Party proposed a suggestion by Ernst Wirmer, {{a member of the}} [...] (parliamentary council) and future advisor of chancellor Konrad Adenauer. Wirmer suggested a variant of the 1944 [...] "Resistance" [...] flag (using the black-red-gold scheme in a Nordic <b>Cross</b> <b>pattern)</b> designed by his brother and 20 July co-conspirator Josef. The tricolour was ultimately selected, largely to illustrate the continuity between the Weimar Republic and this new German state. With the enactment of the (West) German constitution on 23 May 1949, the black-red-gold tricolour was adopted as the flag for the Federal Republic of Germany.|$|E

[...] The current alternative kit is dark sapphire and features the same embossed St. George's Cross but in red, Shorts are also dark sapphire. Home socks are midnight blue with a white top and this is reversed for the alternative socks. In 2013-14, the strip featured plain white shorts and a plain white shirt, but with an added black stripe on each sleeve. The alternative kit had a red and white striped shirt, with blue shorts.In 2014/15, the home shirt was white, with a [...] "V-Neck" [...] around the collar. The kit also had little Victoria Crosses on the main chest. It also had the O2 sponsorship marking on the chest. The shorts were plain white with the sponsorship marking on them. The socks were dark blue and had a white stripe at the top. The alternate shirt was exactly the same but was red instead of white. The shorts were navy blue and the socks were red with a white stripe on top. The 2015/16 strip was similar but didn't have the small crosses on the shirt. The Canterbury logo was straight and not diagonal it had white lines going horizontally across the chest. For the 2015 Rugby World Cup, the kit remained the same just with the Rugby World Cup logo {{on the right and}} no O2 logo in the centre. For the home strip, the shorts and socks remained the same. The away 2015/16 strip and World Cup strip was red, with dark red and maroon sleeves. The shorts were maroon and the socks were red with a maroon stripe on top.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many {{cells in}} cat and monkey visual cortex (area V 1 and area 17) respond to {{gratings}} and bar patterns of different orientation between center and surround [18]. It {{has been shown}} that these cells respond on average 3. 3 times stronger to a <b>crossing</b> <b>pattern</b> than to a single bar [16]. In this paper a computational model for a group of neurons that respond solely to <b>crossing</b> <b>patterns</b> is proposed, and has been implemented in visual programming environment TiViPE [10]. Simulations show that the operator responds very accurately to <b>crossing</b> <b>patterns</b> that have an angular difference between 2 bars of 40 degrees or more, the operator responds appropriately to bar widths that are bound by 50 to 200 percent of the preferred bar width and is insensitive to non-uniform illumination conditions, which appear to be consistent with the experimental results. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract] The {{surfaces}} of 63 extracted premolar teeth were processed with intense ultrashort laser pulses (λ[*]=[*] 795 nm; pulse duration, 120 fs; repetition rate, 1 kHz) to produce <b>cross</b> <b>patterns</b> with different pitches (s) in the micrometer range {{in order to}} evaluate the influence of such microstructures on the shear bond strengths of orthodontic brackets to enamel. The samples were classified in nine groups corresponding to the control group (raw samples) and eight different laser-processed groups (<b>cross</b> <b>patterns</b> with s increasing from 15 to 180 μm). Brackets were luted with TransbondTM XT adhesive resin to all the samples; after 72 h, they all were submitted to strength test in a universal testing machine. Additionally, {{a third of the}} samples underwent morphological analysis of the debonded surface by means of scanning electron microscope microscopy and an analysis of the failure mode based on the adhesive remnant index. The results showed that enamel microstructuring with ultrashort laser pulses remarkably increase the bond strength of brackets. Dense <b>cross</b> <b>patterns</b> (s[*] [*] 90 μm) give rise to smaller improvements of the bond strength. A strong correlation of this behavior with the predominant failure mode in both scenarios was found. So far, the best compromise between suitable adhesive efficiency, processing time minimization, and enamel surface preservation suggests the performance of <b>cross</b> <b>patterns</b> with pitches in the order of 90 μm.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} measurement, development, {{and consequences of}} subtyping in stereotype change. All three studies presented subjects with a pattern of stereotype-disconfirming information that was either concentrated within a few or dispersed across several group members. Experiment 1 <b>crossed</b> this <b>pattern</b> factor with order of rating and memory tasks and identified a new memory-based measure of subtyping (clustering of items in free recall by sub-category). Ratings on stereotype-inconsistent traits were lower and clustering scores higher in the concentrated condition, irrespective of order of tasks. Experiment 2 <b>crossed</b> <b>pattern</b> with whether stimulus information was blocked-by-person or unblocked. Ratings on stereotype-inconsistent traits were higher when information was both dispersed and blocked; subtyping was strong only when information was both concentrated and blocked.

50|$|A HP/UHP {{metamorphism}} {{caused by}} subduction at the Silurian/Devonian boundary was {{followed in the}} Devonian/Mississippian by polyphase dynamometamorphism due to crustal shortening. The latter developed a <b>cross</b> <b>pattern</b> in the resulting structures - the well known Variscan x. The intensive nappe-stacking during continental collision transported high-grade terranes in a southerly direction over less deformed units creating the impression of an inverted metamorphism - a feature so ubiquitous in the Massif Central. The last two deformational phases in the Pennsylvanian formed under extensional stresses and again produced a <b>cross</b> <b>pattern</b> in the resulting structures.

40|$|ABSTRACT: One {{goal of the}} {{experiment}} presented here was to check, in children, the relationship between eye preference when sighting at different angles and eye dominance in binocular rivalry. In addition, since it is sometimes argued that a <b>crossed</b> <b>pattern</b> of eye-hand preference might put children at risk of difficulties in learning to read, we evaluated the relationship between this pattern and reading achievement in first and sixth graders. Results showed {{that a majority of}} children are right-eyed for monosighting, and that intrinsic preference and spatial factor influence the choice of eye. As many children were right- or left-eye dominant, and eye dominance was not related to eye preference. We found no relationship between eye-hand preference and reading proficiency, thus not confirming that a <b>crossed</b> <b>pattern</b> of eye-hand preference might put children at risk of difficulties in learning to read. Consistent handers were more advanced in reading than inconsistent handers...|$|R
