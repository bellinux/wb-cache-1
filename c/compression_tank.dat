2500|$|Research {{is being}} done testing various {{activated}} carbons' ability to store natural gas and hydrogen gas. [...] The porous material acts like a sponge for different types of gases. The gas is attracted to the carbon material via Van der Waals forces. Some carbons {{have been able to}} achieve bonding energies of 5–10 kJ per mol. The gas may then be desorbed when subjected to higher temperatures and either combusted to do work {{or in the case of}} hydrogen gas extracted for use in a hydrogen fuel cell. Gas storage in activated carbons is an appealing gas storage method because the gas can be stored in a low pressure, low mass, low volume environment that would be much more feasible than bulky on board <b>compression</b> <b>tanks</b> in vehicles. The United States Department of Energy has specified certain goals to be achieved in the area of research and development of nano-porous carbon materials.

40|$|Wind {{power is}} one of the cleanest and safest of all the {{renewable}} commercial methods of generating electricity. However, wind energy is difficult to use due to its stochastic variability. Energy storage can overcome the main drawback, allowing energy production to match energy demand. In this paper, new hydrogen storage systems are investigated as a way to solve this problem. A new methodology, based on the differences between wind power generation and load variability, was developed in this study to optimize the technology, energy capacity and power transfer of the hydrogen energy storage method for specified applications. The dynamics of the complete hydrogen cycle energy storage and recovery mechanism was investigated, specifically for potential applications such as power smoothing and peak lopping. A time dependant model of the efficiency of various hydrogen storage technologies, including high pressure compression, low temperature liquefaction, metal hydrides and complex hydrides, has been developed. Based on this study, a practical hydrogen energy storage system for a 5 MW micro-grid application was designed. The micro-grid's electrical load requirements and the available wind energy in the local area are used as an example to demonstrate the new methodology. Using these results, the paper demonstrates that a practical system to provide hydrogen energy storage within this micro-grid using high temperature water electrolysis and high pressure <b>compression</b> <b>tank</b> storage is the best way forward...|$|E
40|$|Earthquakes {{can cause}} {{significant}} damages to industrial liquid storage tanks resulting in losses of functionality, fires or environmental contamination {{due to the}} leakage of hazardous chemicals. Typical damages of ground supported tanks during past earthquakes were {{in the form of}} cracking {{at the corner of the}} bottom plate and <b>compression</b> buckling of <b>tank</b> wall due to uplift, sliding of the base, anchorage failure, sloshing damage around the roof, failure of piping systems and plastic deformation of base plate. Liquid tanks can be also located at some elevated positions due to operational purposes. This makes them susceptible to collapse due to increased base shears and overturning moments. The seismic response of elevated tanks has been widely investigated in the past considering different materials and configurations of support structures. This paper addresses the problem of elevated tanks with particular attention focused on the steel storage tanks resting on short RC columns. The vulnerability of a real example of elevated tanks is assessed though the probabilistic analysis performed using non-linear lumped mass models. Consequently different fragility curves are built for identifying the most important damage states and calculating the corresponding probability of occurrence. The results show how the support structure, especially when composed by RC columns, is the most influencing one, whereas the remaining damage states have a limited influence...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{its high}} {{chemical}} energy content {{and to the}} fact that its oxidation byproduct is water, hydrogen is currently {{considered one of the most}} promising green fuels. Despite its good perspective as an energy vector, it presents some problems in concerning the storage and transport. The most obvious storage system, namely the <b>compression</b> within <b>tanks,</b> presents some safety risk, related {{to the fact that}} it is highly explosive under pressure. In addition this kind of storage requires heavy tanks that decrease the overall gravimetric and volumetric capacity of the system. One possibility to overcome safety and capacity problems is to considered new specifically designed materials. One currently considered is graphene, the two dimensional honeycomb lattice of sp 2 hybridized carbon. Specifically, hydrogen can be either physisorbed in molecular form onto graphene sheets (or within them), or chemisorbed, forming covalent C-H bonds and generating the graphene hydrogenated counterpart, called graphane. While physisorption is a very weak linkage based on Van der Waals interactions, which leads to reasonable storage capacity only at low temperatures and high pressures, chemisorption creates a very stable linkage and relatively high storage capacities (up to 7 - 8 % of hydrogen mass stored with respect to the total mass of the mean), and gives the possibility of safe transportation. However this is obtained at the expenses of high barriers for the adsorption/desorption, leading to slow kinetic for the loading/discharge, or imposing the use of high temperatures. These problems are common to all the others proposed materials that use chemisorption as storage process (e. g. N or B hydrides, hydrocarbons). However, at variance with those, and because of its unique mechanical and structural properties, graphene offers alternative ways to overcome these problems. Graphene is extremely resistant and flexible, thus it can be rippled by compression or by mean of interactions with specific substrates over which it is deposited. Moreover, it was shown that convexities have enhanced reactivity towards hydrogen. This considered, corrugation and its control was proposed as a possible mean to control the adsorption/desorption of hydrogen. It is to be observed that this possibility is related not only to the exceptional properties of graphene, but also to the specific fact that it is a 2 D crystal, and therefore its flexibility can be exploited. This thesis work focus on the structural, electronic and dynamical properties of rippled graphene, with the specific focus of its interaction with hydrogen. The methods used for the study are numerical calculations and simulations based on the Density Functional Theory. First, different rippled structures are created by lateral compression of a supercell including ~ 54 C atoms. The symmetry of the graphene supercell is chosen so to match the structure of the natural rippling observed in graphene grown by Si evaporation from SiC. This allows a direct comparison with available experimental determination of the structure and electronic structure by STM. In fact, the effect of rippling on the band structure and electronic properties of graphene is evaluated by calculating them on relaxed structures at different levels of rippling, and compared with experiment. Subsequently, rippled structures were hydrogenated by adding hydrogen on specific sites. At each stage, hydrogen is added on those sites whose binding energy is larger, so to mimic the natural hydrogenation process. Structures with different hydrogen decoration were relaxed and their electronic structures evaluated. Even in this case, comparison with corresponding experimental determinations are possible. Finally, a structure with maximum hydrogen loading was created, and its stability is studied by means of an extensive molecular dynamics simulation. The starting structure was relaxed and then subjected to simulated annealing. During this phase hydrogen hopping is observed, until a stabler configuration/decoration is reached. The electronic properties of the maximally loaded structure are then evaluated. All the calculations and simulations are performed with the QuantumEspresso code, implemented on the FERMI Blue Gene Q parallel system at CINECA. This study gives indication on the hydrogenation process of a model system mimicking a real one, i. e. the naturally rippled graphene on SiC, and hints on possible strategies to efficiently the loading/discharge kinetics...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the many}} air-conditioning, refrigeration, and heating {{applications}} that utilize vapor compression equipment, the vapor compression cycle {{has been the focus}} of significant research. The combination of rising energy costs and increasing environmental awareness motivates the development of more efficient cycle components, including higher performance compressors, heat exchangers, and expansion devices for recovering work. However, modifications to the basic vapor compression cycle also show potential for significantly improving cooling cycle performance through increased cooling capacity and COP. ^ The current study investigates the performance improvements that can be achieved through the use of intercooling and economizing. A basic cycle model that uses a compressor with a fixed isentropic efficiency is developed in EES to study these configurations. The model first considers two-stage compression with intercooling between the stages, which does not improve the cooling capacity but provides an increase in COP as a result of decreased compressor work. ^ The basic cycle model considers two different approaches for economizing with two-stage compression. The first approach uses a flash tank to supply saturated vapor to the compressor between the stages. Drawing off the saturated vapor in the flash tank to mix with the first-stage compressor discharge gas not only cools the compression gas, reducing the compression work, but also results in an increased cooling capacity. Therefore, flash tank economization provides a significantly greater improvement in COP compared to intercooling under the same operating conditions. ^ The second approach to economizing uses an intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) to supply two-phase or vaporized refrigerant to the compressor at the intermediate pressure. The IHX achieves results identical to those for flash tank economization if the IHX has an effectiveness of 100 %, but the performance of the system with IHX economizing degrades significantly as the heat exchanger effectiveness decreases. ^ Therefore, the cycle with flash tank economization is selected for further study. The basic cycle model with two-stage <b>compression</b> and flash <b>tank</b> economization is modified to consider an increasing number of injection points and a flash tank that can supply two-phase refrigerant. The decrease in the enthalpy of the injected refrigerant and the increased number of injection ports moves the compression process closer to the liquid-vapor dome and therefore decreases the compression work. The number of injection points is then increased to approach the limiting case of continuous injection, which minimizes the compressor power consumption by maintaining a saturated vapor state in the compressor. ^ To improve the accuracy of these cycle model predictions, two comprehensive compressor models are developed. A thermodynamic model of a two-stage rolling piston compressor is developed with consideration for leakage and heat transfer in the compressor. The compressor model is validated by experimental testing of a prototype two-stage rolling piston, and is then used to study the effect of intercooling on the compressor performance. ^ While the two-stage rolling-piston compressor operates with two separate compression chambers in series, the benefits of staging can also be realized by injecting economized refrigerant through ports in a single-stage rotary compressor. Therefore, a model of a novel rotary spool compressor with refrigerant injection is developed to study the effect of multiple injection ports on compressor and cycle performance. The model without injection is validated through experimental testing of a prototype spool compressor and provides a valuable tool for improving the prototype compressor design. ^ The model is then used to predict the compressor performance with a single injection port while varying the port diameter, port location and injection pressure. For an R- 22 cycle operating with an evaporating temperature of – 7. 2 °C, a suction temperature of 7. 6 °C and a condensing temperature of 48. 8 °C, the model predicts that a single injection port will increase the COP of the basic vapor compression cycle by up to 12 %. Incorporating a second injection port increases the COP of the cycle by 16 % over the baseline value without injection. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a high pressure experimental and modelling investigation on the ignition of n-butylcyclohexane and its mixtures with n-heptane. Mixtures {{were chosen to}} represent a surrogate for n-decylcyclohexane, a constituent of transportation fuels which has an extremely low vapour pressure and hence it is currently impossible to carry out gas phase experiments using this fuel. Thus, mixtures of 53 % n-butylcyclohexane and 47 % n-heptane were prepared and studied to mimic the same hydrogen/carbon ratio as n-decylcyclohexane. Ignition delay times were measured in two heated shock tubes in the temperature range 800 - 1550 K, at reflected shock 1, 10, 30 and 50 atm and at equivalence ratios of 0. 3, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 in air for both n-butylcyclohexane and mixtures of n-butylcyclohexane / n-heptane. The shock tubes {{used in this study}} consists of a 3 m driver section and 5. 73 m driven section separated by a double diaphragm section. Upon rupture of the diaphragm a shock wave is generated. This shock wave moves into the driven section compressing and heating the test gas. The ignition delay time is defined as the time from the arrival of the shock wave at the end wall to the ignition of the fuel. Ignition delay times were measured from 50 Âµs to 3 ms. Ignition delay times were also measured in a heated rapid compression machine in the temperature range 580 - 800 K, at compressed gas pressures of 10 and 30 atm for both n-butylcyclohexane and mixtures of n-butylcyclohexane / n-heptane at the equivalence ratios outlined for the shock tube. The rapid compression machine used in this study is a twin opposed system capable of compression of test gas mixtures up to 60 atm with a compression time of approximately 16 ms. Ignition delay times were measured from 3 ms to 100 ms. Due to the low vapour pressures of the fuels used in this study homogeneous heating of the equipment was essential to ensure that the fuel remained in the gas phase. Heating systems were installed onto the shock tubes and rapid <b>compression</b> machine, mixing <b>tanks</b> and manifolds. Experimental results obtained for both n-butylcyclohexane and mixtures of n-butylcyclohexane / n-heptane were compared to simulations of two models which are available in the literature, JetSurF 2. 0 and Natelson et al [...] The models failed to capture the experimental data. In addition ignition delay times are also measured in the low pressure shock tube. This is a stainless steel shock tube with a 6. 22 m driven section and a barrel shaped driver section. This is a single diaphragm shock tube. During an experiment the diaphragm is ruptured by a cross shaped cutter housed inside the driven section of the shock tube. Increased drive gas pressure caused the diaphragm to bulge and come in contact with the cutter resulting in the bursting of the diaphragm. Ignition delay time is defined as the time from the arrival of shock wave at the end wall to the maximum rise in CH* emission. Ignition delay times were measured from 50 Âµs to 1000 Âµs. Ignition delay times of the isomers of pentene were measured in the low-pressure shock tube. Experiments were carried out using 1 - and 2 -pentene in the temperature range 1250 - 1900 K, at a reflected shock pressure of 1 atm and at equivalence ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 at 1 % fuel concentration. Experimental results were used to validate the model of Mehl et al. This work was presented at the 33 rd Internal Symposium on Combustion. Ignition delay times were also measured for 2, 5 -dimethylfuran in the low pressure shock tube. Experiments were carried out in the temperature range 1300 - 2000 K, at a reflected shock pressure of 1 and 2 atm and at equivalence ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 at 0. 75 % fuel concentration. This works builds upon a study previously carried out by G. Black at NUI Galway where low pressure shock tube ignition delay times were measured at 1 atm, phi = 1. 0 and 2. 5.
