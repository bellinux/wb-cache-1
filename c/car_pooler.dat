40|$|The rising car usage {{deriving}} from growth in jobs and residential population results in air pollution, energy waste and unproductive and unpleasant consumption of people’s time. Public transport cannot {{be the only}} answer to this increasing transport demand. <b>Car</b> <b>pooling</b> has emerged {{to be a viable}} possibility for reducing private car usage in congested areas. Its actual practice requires a suitable information system support and, most important, the capability of effectively solving the underlying combinatorial optimization problem. This paper presents a brief introduction to the problem of <b>car</b> <b>pooling,</b> gives a formal definition of one variant of <b>car</b> <b>pooling,</b> the long term <b>car</b> <b>pooling</b> problem, argues on the soundness of the problem formulation, and proves the long term <b>car</b> <b>pooling</b> problem to be NP-complete. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{combined}} token economy and reserved parking program were evaluated {{as a means of}} increasing <b>car</b> <b>pooling</b> among students on a university campus. Following a baseline period, students in two experimental parking lots were notified of the availability of reserved parking and coupons redeemable for 25 cents in merchandise for each occupant of automobiles containing two or more people. Two control lots also were monitored for a comparison of treatment effects. Results indicated variable increases in <b>car</b> <b>pooling</b> in the two experimental lots and no increase in the control lots. Removal of the 25 -cent coupons from one treatment lot (reserved parking only) did not adversely affect rates of <b>car</b> <b>pooling.</b> An analysis of individual automobile occupancy rates among car poolers indicated distinct patterns of <b>car</b> <b>pooling</b> and underscored the importance of individual subject data analysis in the present situation. A cost-benefit analysis indicated that even moderately effective <b>car</b> <b>pool</b> programs can be cost-effective on both a public and personal level...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} deals with <b>car</b> <b>pooling</b> {{as a means}} of making better use of existing infrastructure and {{as a means of}} reducing traffic congestion with all its associated induced effects. <b>Car</b> <b>pooling</b> schemes involve several drivers getting together to share a private vehicle simultaneously, in order to reach their destinations points according to a semi-common route rather than each driver using their own vehicle. The <b>Car</b> <b>Pooling</b> Problem belongs to the non-polynomial computational complexity family of operations problems. In the current literature {{there are only a few}} studies on this optimization problem: the research group has designed several different new automatic and heuristic data processing routines to support efficient matching in <b>car</b> <b>pool</b> schemes. These are based on savings functions and belong to two distinct macro classes of algorithms to give two different modelings of this problem. They offer average savings of more than 50 % in traveled distances demonstrating the effectiveness of a trivial matching scheme for real applications...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{and the associated}} pressure in car parking that results from growing car ownership require the study of innovative measures {{to reduce the number}} of cars traveling every day to the city centers specifically single occupant vehicles. <b>Car</b> <b>pooling</b> is a system by which a person shares his private vehicle with one or more people that have common or aligned destinations. Until now this systems have been applied mainly in the United States and some Northern European Countries but with modest results. Trust between occupants has proven to be essential for <b>car</b> <b>pooling</b> viability. This paper presents the concept of <b>car</b> <b>pooling</b> clubs as a means to affiliate its members increasing trust between them and at the same time allowing a more flexible matching between the participants. 1...|$|R

Other factors that foster initiatives for BEV procurement are organizational innovativeness, and the expectation of environmental benefits and positive effects on employee motivation.
