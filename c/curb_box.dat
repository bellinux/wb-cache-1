50|$|A <b>curb</b> <b>box</b> (also {{known as}} a valve box, buffalo box, or b-box) is a {{vertical}} cast iron sleeve, accessible from the public way, housing the shut-off valve (curb cock or curb stop) for a property's water service line. It is typically located between a building and the district's water main lines and usually consists of a metal tube with a removable or sliding lid, allowing access to the turn-key within. It typically serves as the point denoting the separation of utility-maintained and privately-maintained water facilities.|$|E
50|$|In the slow, {{strategic}} race {{held in a}} {{light rain}} on a muddy dirt track Michel Jazy {{was more of a}} 1500 meter runner and expected to be ready for a fast finish. He kept himself in the lead or close to the lead throughout. Schul found himself on the <b>curb</b> <b>boxed</b> in by a loping Keino who seemed to be marking the field {{on the outside of the}} pack that also included future world record holder Ron Clarke. With 600 metres to go, the future coach of Steve Prefontaine, Bill Dellinger made the first move coming around the entire pack and into the lead. At age 30, old for an amateur athlete in this era, Dillinger came out of retirement to make one last attempt after failing to make the Olympic final the previous two Olympiads. Dillinger's move was marked by Jazy as the pace quickened. Nikolay Dutov came around the entire pack to challenge Jazy and Dillinger. Shortly after the bell, Jazy decided to take off, jumping to the lead with Harald Norpoth coming from mid pack to become his closest pursuer 5 metres back as the field stretched out. A one speed runner, Clarke had no answer for the speedsters. With 300 to go, Schul came from fifth place to start picking off runners to get to Norpoth with 200 to go. Through the turn he passed Norpoth with Jazy constantly looking over his shoulder to check his pursuer. Jazy still had a two metres lead as they reached the final straight. But that lead disappeared rapidly as Schul sprinted by to take the gold medal. Jazy now watched Norpoth as he slowly edged by just before the finish. Given all he could, Jazy tried to maintain and glide across the finish line, but Dellinger, in full sprint, caught Jazy at the line to take the bronze medal.|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s the Great Depression came so {{the shop}} was closed as {{people did not}} have money for luxuries like jewellery. Henry started doing beaten copper work under the house in Arnold Road making; <b>box</b> <b>curbs,</b> fire screens and bellows. He made all his own designs and dyes and sold his works to The Farmers Trading Company in Hobson Street. During the hard times, Henry got labouring jobs hand mixing {{concrete}} on such places as The Civic Theatre in Auckland and the Chateau Tongariro.|$|R
