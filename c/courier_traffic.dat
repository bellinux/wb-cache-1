2500|$|Maya is a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency analyst, {{recruited}} [...] "out of high school" [...] around 1999, {{tasked with}} finding the al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. In 2003 she is {{stationed at the}} U.S. embassy in Pakistan. She and fellow officer Dan, attend the blacksite interrogations of Ammar, a detainee with suspected links to several of the 2001 hijackers in the September 11 attacks, who is subjected to approved torture interrogation techniques. Ammar provides unreliable information on a suspected attack in Saudi Arabia, but does reveal to Maya the previously unknown name of the personal courier for bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Other detainee intelligence connects <b>courier</b> <b>traffic</b> by Abu Ahmed between Abu Faraj al-Libbi and bin Laden. In 2005, Faraj denies knowing about a courier named Abu Ahmed; she interprets this as an attempt by Faraj to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed.|$|E
50|$|The Hamilton International Airport is an alternate, relief {{airport to}} Pearson, {{but not in}} the GTA. Situated in Hamilton, 85 km {{southwest}} of Toronto, it is also a terminus for low-cost carrier, charter airline, and <b>courier</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
5000|$|He {{published}} the book Fra Oscarsborg til Hegra in 1945, on the Norwegian Campaign in southern Norway. The book {{was based on}} lectures he had given in Sweden during the war. In 1946 he published Usynlige Veier ("Invisible paths"), on refugee escorts and <b>courier</b> <b>traffic</b> between Norway and Sweden during the war.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{discussing}} {{some aspects}} of the use of focus groups as a research strategy. The discussion has grounds in the qualitative research experience carried out in order to explore the motorcycle <b>couriers</b> point-of-view about <b>traffic</b> accident risks in their daily work. The paper describes the process of information gathered from the two focus groups since the field preparation until the information analysis generated in the interaction group. Point out the exploratory potentials of focus groups, as well as the importance of careful planning of fieldwork for the full use of this potentia...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{trajectory}} data {{is the key}} to {{a growing}} number of applications aiming at global understanding and management of complex phenomena that involve moving objects (e. g. worldwide <b>courier</b> distribution, city <b>traffic</b> management, bird migration monitoring). Current DBMS support for such data is limited to the ability to store and query raw movement (i. e. the spatio-temporal position of an object). This paper explores how conceptual modeling could provide applications with direct support of trajectories (i. e. movement data that is structured into countable semantic units) as a first class concept. A specific concern is to allow enriching trajectories with semantic annotations allowing users to attach semantic data to specific parts of the trajectory. Building on a preliminary requirement analysis and an application example, the paper proposes two modeling approaches, one based on a design pattern, the other based on dedicated data types, and illustrates their differences in terms of implementation in an extended-relational context. Key words: Trajectories, moving objects, spatio-temporal databases, GIS ⋆ This work is done in the context of GeoPKDD, an EEC project (IST- 6 FP- 014915) supported by the FP 6 programme of the European Community.

50|$|Being {{the second}} busiest cargo airport in Brazil, Viracopos has 77,000 square meters (646,000 square feet) of cargo terminals, 1,700 square meters (18,300 square feet) for animal cargo, and 1,480 cubic meters (52,200 square feet) of {{refrigerated}} space. As a major import/export hub, Viracopos enjoys 'express lanes' for <b>courier</b> <b>traffic</b> which are exceptionally quick and unbureaucratic by Brazilian standards.|$|E
50|$|From 1942 Harald Gram {{was leading}} the {{so-called}} Idrettskontoret, which organised <b>courier</b> <b>traffic</b> between Norway and Sweden. Idrettskontoret was a blind for agent practice, among others for 2A agents. Annæus Schjødt's wife Hedevig Schjødt, a 2A agent like her husband, was active in Idrettskontoret as well. However Idrettskontoret also organised courses in physical education, as an equivalent to the National Gymnastic School (now: the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences) which still operated in occupied Norway. The leader of the course was Sigurd Dahle, {{acting director of the}} National Gymnastic School from 1945 to 1947.|$|E
5000|$|Hovdan was {{a member}} of the Norwegian {{resistance}} movement during the German occupation of Norway. She was arrested by the Nazi authorities in June 1941 for propaganda against Germany, incarcerated at Møllergata 19 and Grini concentration camp, and released in October 1941. She was involved with the activist network [...] "2A", supported people hiding from the Nazis and helped them to escape to Sweden. She had to flee to Sweden in April 1942, where she worked at the Norwegian legation in Stockholm, in the [...] "Sports Office" [...] (Idrettskontoret), headed by Harald Gram, which organized underground <b>courier</b> <b>traffic</b> between Sweden and Norway.|$|E
50|$|He managed an {{undercover}} resistance organization in Norway during {{the five years}} of German occupation. From a centralized camp he activated resistance groups {{in different parts of}} the country. The camp developed sectors for economy, transport, distribution, newspapers, sabotage, intelligence and <b>courier</b> <b>traffic,</b> and organized farmers, women and youth. The camp was typically located in isolated mountain dairy farms, and could have a security zone with a 10-kilometre radius. External visits to the headquarters were only allowed during relocation periods. Frequent conferences were normally held at mountain huts or farms within a wider zone. Security personnel were located in the surrounding rural districts, and the camp received intelligence reports from observations of the Gestapo headquarters in Oslo and other cities.|$|E
50|$|Air Foyle started {{operations}} {{as an executive}} air charter company with one Piper Aztec aircraft in 1978. It grew its fleet of Aztec, Navajo and Chieftain aircraft by carrying passenger, cargo and aerial survey flights. In 1979 it pioneered the overnight carriage of <b>courier</b> <b>traffic</b> between the UK and Europe operating a nightly flight between Luton and Brussels for Skypak (later a TNT company). In 1985 it started providing larger cargo aircraft to TNT, by then its principal cargo customer, using wet leased Handley Page Dart Herald aircraft operating nightly from Birmingham to Nuremberg and Hannover and these were later replaced by a BAC One-Eleven jet cargo aircraft and then by a Boeing 737-200QC aircraft wet leased from Aer Lingus. When TNT {{announced that it would}} order 72 British Aerospace 146 aircraft converted to freighters, Air Foyle won the contract to operate these aircraft on behalf of TNT, then an Australian company. This operation commenced in May 1987 with one BAe 146 aircraft and rapidly expanded to ten such aircraft which Air Foyle then operated for thirteen years for TNT on a nightly schedule from various airports in the UK and mainland Europe into TNT's hub in Cologne and later Liège.|$|E
