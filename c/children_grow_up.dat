5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how <b>children</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E

25|$|Under normal conditions, {{language}} {{seems to}} develop {{in a similar way}} among all children but when <b>children</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> in a radically different environment their language is significantly different. A number of examples including wild children show that certain elements of the early environment are essential for language learning. Amala and Kamala and Genie never managed to fully progress to learning language. While these examples are extreme, they show that consumer’s language is affected by their environment. This is especially true of marketing activities across geographical borders.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of this social and {{political}} change, hunter-gatherer egalitarianism is established. As <b>children</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up,</b> they are motivated by those around them to reverse perspective, engaging with other minds on the model of their own. Selection pressures favour such psychological innovations as imaginative empathy, joint attention, moral judgment, project-oriented collaboration and the ability to evaluate one's own behaviour from the standpoint of others. Underpinning enhanced probabilities of cultural transmission and cumulative cultural evolution, these developments culminate in the establishment of hunter-gatherer-style egalitarianism in association with intersubjective communication and cognition. It is in this social and political context that language evolves.|$|E
25|$|According to the World Health Organization, {{malnutrition}} is {{the biggest}} contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases. Six million children die of hunger every year. Underweight births and intrauterine growth restrictions cause 2.2 million child deaths a year. Poor or non-existent breastfeeding causes another 1.4 million. Other deficiencies, such as lack of vitamin A or zinc, for example, account for 1 million. Malnutrition {{in the first two}} years is irreversible. Malnourished <b>children</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> with worse health and lower education achievement. Their own children tend to be smaller. Malnutrition was previously seen as something that exacerbates the problems of diseases such as measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, but malnutrition actually causes diseases, and can be fatal in its own right.|$|E
25|$|Adoption {{was very}} common, {{especially}} when the father (or mother) was childless or had seen all his <b>children</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> and marry away. The child was then adopted {{to care for the}} parents' old age. This was done by contract, which usually specified what the parent had to leave and what maintenance was expected. The natural children, if any, were usually consenting parties to an arrangement that cut off their expectations. In some cases they even acquired the estate for the adopted child who was to relieve them of care. If the adopted child failed to carry out the filial duty, the contract was annulled in the law courts. Slaves were often adopted, and if they proved unfilial, were reduced to slavery again.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The author {{compared}} monosyllabic Mandarin lexical tones {{produced by}} 3 -year-old Mandarin-speaking <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in Taiwan {{and in the}} United States. Method: Following the procedures in Wong, Schwartz, and Jenkins (2005), the author collected monosyllabic tone productions from 3 -year-old Mandarin-speaking children in Taiwan and low-pass filtered them to eliminate lexical information but retain tone information. Five Mandarin-speaking adults residing in Taiwan categorized these filtered tones and those produced by the Mandarin-speaking <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in the United States, the latter of which was reported in Wong et al. (2005). Agreements on tone categorization by judges residing in Taiwan and in the United States were evaluated. Tone accuracy of <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in Taiwan and the United States were examined and compared. Results: The Mandarin-speaking judges residing in the United States and in Taiwan showed high agreements on tone categorization. None of the 4 tones produced by the Mandarin-speaking <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in the United States and in Taiwan was adultlike. Children in Taiwan made more errors in Tone 2 and Tone 4 than didMandarin-speaking <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in the United States. Accuracy rates of Tone 1 and Tone 3 were comparable in the 2 groups of children. Conclusion: Mandarin tone acquisition is a protracted process. Three-year-old Mandarin-speaking <b>children</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> in Taiwan and the United States show similar developmental patterns and have not yet produced monosyllabic tones with adultlike accuracy. postprin...|$|R

25|$|A {{review study}} {{suggested}} that the children with lesbian or gay parents appear less traditionally gender-typed {{and are more likely}} to be open to homoerotic relationships, partly due to genetic (80% of the children being raised by same-sex couples in the US are not adopted and most are the result of heterosexual marriages)) and family socialization processes (<b>children</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> in relatively more tolerant school, neighborhood, and social contexts, which are less heterosexist), even though majority of children raised by same-sex couples identify as heterosexual. A 2005 review by Charlotte J. Patterson for the American Psychological Association found that the available data did not suggest higher rates of homosexuality among the children of lesbian or gay parents. One study suggested that children of gay and lesbian parents were more likely to adopt non-heterosexual identities, especially daughters of lesbian parents (inter-generational transfer was not significant in some analyses for sons).|$|E
500|$|On July 9, the Human Rights Subcommittee of the United States House of Representatives {{convened a}} hearing on the one-child policy {{prompted}} by Feng's story.

[...] He said that because of Feng, people were [...] "finally seeing the gruesome reality of China’s one-child policy." [...] Congressman Joseph R. Pitts agreed, saying [...] "It now seems that consensus in China is building towards reforming the policy." [...] Committee witnesses called for a number of responses such as restricting United Nations Population Fund outlays and encouraging U.S. corporations doing business in China to reject the country's family-planning practices at their facilities.|$|E
500|$|It is {{difficult}} to teach delayed gratification when <b>children</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> expecting a large, instant reward for their years of schooling. Societal impacts and current media trends have {{had the effect of}} teaching people to expect instant gratification. The idea of waiting for a good job, earned through working from the bottom up, frequently upsets and frustrates emerging adults in today's society. This desire for immediate gratification is not only found in workplaces, but also in interpersonal relationships. Current studies show that 45% of marriages will end in divorce. Without the ability to delay gratification people are more apt to end relationships rather than work on them. Our society today makes it increasingly easy to receive instant gratification. According to Daniel Forrester, [...] "e have devalued the time we spend alone just thinking, but it's that time for reflection that leads to the big ideas [...] Multitasking is espoused and almost glorified in the United States, but it is dehumanizing us and making us less creative." ...|$|E

[...] "Home Is Such a Lonely Place" [...] is a ballad with [...] "clean arpeggiated finger-picking guitars with strings underneath it." [...] Its lyrics are themed around lost love; it emerged from an early-morning coffee meeting between Hoppus and Feldmann, who both imagined how lonely their homes would be when their <b>children</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> and move away. [...] "Kings of the Weekend" [...] was also nearly moved off the final track listing, but kept because of its recognizable guitar riff. Feldmann described it as [...] "the party song.

[...] "Teenage Satellites" [...] is based around [...] "being a kid and not knowing who you are, not having enough courage to say what you mean." [...] It was the last song recorded for the album, and it was at first written without a hook or melody in mind. [...] "Left Alone" [...] made the album cut because the band liked Skiba's vocal performance.

60|$|How {{do things}} stand? Each {{year in this}} country about 100,000 babies die before they have come into the world; {{and out of the}} 800,000 born, about 90,000 die. Many mothers become {{permanently}} damaged in health by evil birth conditions. Many <b>children</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> mentally or physically defective. One in four of the children in our elementary schools are not in a condition to benefit properly by their schooling. What sublime waste! Ten in a hundred of them suffer from malnutrition; thirty in the hundred have defective eyes; eighty in the hundred need dental treatment; twenty odd in the hundred have enlarged tonsils or adenoids. Many, perhaps most, of these deaths and defects are due to the avoidable ignorance, ill-health, mitigable poverty, and other handicaps which dog poor mothers before and after a baby's birth. One doesn't know which to pity most--the mothers or the babies. Fortunately, to help the one is to help the other. In passing I would like to record two sentiments: my strong impression that we ought to follow the example of America and establish Mothers' Pensions; and my strong hope that those who visit the sins of the fathers upon illegitimate children will receive increasingly the contempt they deserve from every decent-minded citizen.|$|E
