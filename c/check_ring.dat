40|$|Sixty-nine Chiropsalmus quadrigatus medusae were {{collected}} from Okinawa Island, Japan, in June-August 2000. The bell height ranged from 2. 5 to 97. 6 mm. The numbers of fine rings on polished statoliths were counted, and the coefficient of variation for the within-individual counts for the four statoliths was 3. 3 ± 1. 9 % (mean::tSD, n= 17). The slope of the linear regression {{of the number of}} rings against collecting date in 61 medusae was near 1. 0, suggesting that the statolith rings are daily increments. The relationship between bell height and number of rings fitted a logistic growth curve. And, the relationship between statolith length and number of rings fitted the Gompertz growth curve. A <b>check</b> <b>ring</b> was present at a position of 5 - 10 rings from the center of each statolith. The backcalculated dates of <b>check</b> <b>ring</b> formation dated mainly from early to mid June, suggesting that the polyp of C. quadrigatus finished the metamorphosis to medusa and the medusa was liberated from a substratum during this period...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1969. BiologyBibiography: leaves 80 - 88. The otolith radius-fish length {{relationship}} in capelin {{is shown to}} {{take the form of}} an heterogonic curve with an inflexion point occurring at the size of maturity for both sexes. This relationship changes with sex, age and maturity. A linear relationship between otolith radius and fish length, as determined by regression analyses, was found to exist only within an age-group. This necessitated the use of separate equations for back-calculating the lengths of each age. Growth curves of Trinity Bay capelin, as constructed from back- calculated lengths, indicated that male capelin grow faster than female capelin up to the age at maturity after which the growth rates remain the same. Inferences about age at first maturity of Trinity Bay capelin are made from otolith-age curves which suggest that capelin normally spawn more than once. Growth compensation in its typical form and Lee’s phenomenon are shown to exist in capelin and reasons are given for their presence. It is suggested that growth compensation in capelin is not only acquired from the growth patterns of the different age-groups but is also an inherent feature of its growth. [...] The method of ageing Trinity Bay capelin from otoliths is validated and the embryonic nucleus or larval <b>check</b> <b>ring</b> is described from the otoliths of larval capelin. Comparison of the otoliths of capelin from various regions of the northwest Atlantic indicates that there is a distinct decrease {{in the size of the}} first annulus from south to north. The otolith radius-fish length relationships of capelin from various regions of the northwest Atlantic are compared by age, sex and maturity. No consistent differences were apparent except those created by local variations in growth rate and maturity.

For each fragment we establish whether a cutoff exists, and for some concrete topologies, such as rings, cliques and stars, we infer small cutoffs.

40|$|The {{periodicity}} of {{formation of}} growth increments in the otoliths of South African sparids was validated by the oxytetracycline labelling technique. Intramuscular injections of oxytetracycline at a dosage of 250 mg/kg marked the otoliths of laboratory held juvenile sparids, while a dosage range of 50 - 100 mg/kg oxytetracycline, injected intramuscularly, marked adult sparids in the field. Laboratory held, larval sparid otoliths {{were marked by}} immersion for 24 hrs a solution of 100 - 150 mg/l alizarin complexone. Both daily (microstructural) and annual (macrostructural) growth increments were identified in the otoliths. The micro incremental pattern of deposition in the sparid otoliths conformed to the general pattern of otolith structure. Sparid otoliths consisted of a central opaque nucleus composed of multiple primordia. surrounding this nucleus were daily increments which decreased in width as {{the distance from the}} nucleus increased. Both <b>check</b> <b>rings</b> and subdaily increments were visible throughout the otolith. Minor environmental changes did not affect micro incremental deposition. Narrow opaque and wide hyaline annual growth zones were identified in sectioned sparid otoliths. Scanning electron microscope analysis of the annual growth zones revealed that microincrements within the opaque zone were narrowly spaced with prominent discontinuous phases. This resulted in the greater optical density and higher protein content of the zone. The hyaline zone was composed of widely spaced daily increments with prominent incremental phases accounting for the translucent nature of this zone. Opaque zone formation in the otoliths of many South African sparids was found to occur primarily during periods of reproductive activity and was shown to be indicative of slow otolith growth. The hyaline zone was formed after the spawning season, representative of fast otolith growth. The results of this study have resolved much of the controversy surrounding the rate of growth and time of formation of the opaque and hyaline growth zones in South African sparid otoliths...|$|R

30|$|Otolith microstructures {{between the}} {{temperate}} A. japonica and tropical A. marmorata were fundamentally the same (Arai et al. 2001 a). DGIs in otoliths of glass eels {{are composed of}} two layers called the incremental (L) and discontinuous (D) zones, which respectively appeared to be light and dark as revealed by the SEM photo in Figure  2 a. The L-zone is rich in calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), while the D-zone is very rich in protein but poor in calcium. When etched with hydrochloric acid (HCl) or EDTA and viewed under an SEM, the L-zone appeared elevated while the D-zone appeared as a ridge. A single DGI is usually composed of an L-zone and a D-zone and is generally deposited on a daily basis. Near the otolith edge, a distinct growth check called the elver check was found (Figure  2 b). The elver check was deposited in the elver stage during its migration from seawater to freshwater. It also marks {{the transition from the}} glass eel to the elver stage. On the other hand, DGIs {{at the beginning of the}} leptocephalus stage were wide and clear but became very diffuse and obscure and almost uncountable near the metamorphosis area (Figure  2 c). This indicated that the leptocephalus grew fast during the early developmental stage, then gradually slowed down and reached an asymptotic length before metamorphosis. Thus, an MC was deposited at the transition from the leptocephalus to glass eel stage. After the MC to the otolith edge, the DGIs became wider, indicating that growth speeded up after metamorphosis. The P in the otolith of the elver was an amorphous structure which appeared as a deep hole after etching with HCl or EDTA (Figure  2 d). Distinct concentric growth increments and <b>check</b> <b>rings</b> were observed around the P that marked hatching (HC) and first feeding (FFC). The HC appeared as a deep circular grove surrounding the P. between the HC and FFC, no distinct DGI was discernible (Figure  2 d). From the P to the otolith edge, the change in DGI widths revealed the growth history of the eel as it migrated from the oceanic spawning ground until it was recruited to the estuary (Figure  2 e). Also, the DGIs recorded different life history and developmental stage transitions.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} and present a new construction method for codes using encodings from group rings. They consist primarily of two types: zero-divisor and unit-derived codes. Previous codes from group rings focused on ideals; for example cyclic codes are ideals {{in the group}} ring over a cyclic group. The fresh {{focus is on the}} encodings themselves, which only under very limited conditions result in ideals. We use the result that a group ring is isomorphic to a certain well-defined ring of matrices, and thus every group ring element has an associated matrix. This allows matrix algebra to be used as needed in the study and production of codes, enabling the creation of standard generator and <b>check</b> matrices. Group <b>rings</b> are a fruitful source of units and zero-divisors from which new codes result.

40|$|A {{tree ring}} oxygen isotope (δ 18 OTR) {{chronology}} developed from one species (Cedrela odorata) growing {{in a single}} site {{has been shown to}} be a sensitive proxy for rainfall over the Amazon Basin, thus allowing reconstructions of precipitation in a region where meteorological records are short and scarce. Although these results suggest there should be large-scale (> 100 km) spatial coherence of δ 18 OTR records in the Amazon, this has not been tested. Furthermore, it is of interest to investigate whether other, possibly longer -lived, species similarly record interannual variation of Amazon precipitation, and can be used to develop climate sensitive isotope chronologies. In this study, we measured δ 18 O in tree rings from seven lowland and one highland tree species from Bolivia. We found that cross-dating with δ 18 OTR gave more accurate tree ring dates than using ring width. Our “isotope cross-dating approach” is confirmed with radiocarbon “bomb-peak” dates, and has the potential to greatly facilitate development of δ 18 OTR records in the tropics, identify dating errors, and <b>check</b> annual <b>ring</b> formation in tropical trees. Six of the seven lowland species correlated significantly with C. odorata, showing that variation in δ 18 OTR has a coherent imprint across very different species, most likely arising from a dominant influence of source water δ 18 O on δ 18 OTR. In addition we show that δ 18 OTR series cohere over large distances, within and between species. Comparison of two C. odorata δ 18 OTR chronologies from sites several hundreds of kilometres apart showed a very strong correlation (r = 0. 80, p < 0. 001, 1901 – 2001), and a significant (but weaker) relationship was found between lowland C. odorata trees and a Polylepis tarapacana tree growing in the distant Altiplano (r = 0. 39, p < 0. 01, 1931 – 2001). This large-scale coherence of δ 18 OTR records is probably triggered by a strong spatial coherence in precipitation δ 18 O due to large-scale controls. These results highlight the strength of δ 18 OTR as a precipitation proxy, and open the way for temporal and spatial expansion of precipitation reconstructions in South America...|$|R
