I saw {{the whole}} thing and ordered him to dive and bail out immediately. To my intense relief I saw him leave the aircraft and his parachute blossom. I was happy to get this Airacobra, but I was mad at myself for not harkening to my intuition not to fly with Günther Capito.|$|E
5|$|Hindman joined Confederate {{refugees}} in the Mexican town of Carlota, where he engaged in coffee planting and attempted to practice law. By April 1867, he was confident enough in the situation at home to return to Arkansas and apply to President Andrew Johnson for a pardon. Hindman's application {{was one of the}} few denied; nonetheless, he attempted to return to his former life. Politics still <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and, although ineligible to run for office, he came out against the Reconstruction Constitution, which put him in direct conflict with reconstruction authorities. These authorities revived a treason indictment against him and had him arrested. This did not stop Hindman, who went on the political circuit and had some success building an unlikely coalition of newly freed slaves and Democrats.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the present and retrieving three magical stones to complete the wand, Oliver learns that his mother Allie {{was in fact the}} great sage, Alicia. Realizing she could not defeat Shadar, and that he had destroyed his soulmate in the other world to avoid the possibility of being defeated through them, she chose to travel into both the future and into Oliver's world in the hopes of finding his next soulmate; after settling into this new world, she eventually gave birth to her son, Oliver, who unknowingly became Shadar's soulmate. After he is defeated, Shadar's past is shown. He was once a soldier who helped a young girl against orders, and whose hometown was destroyed to set an example; a being known as the White Witch <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> to embrace his despair and become the Dark Djinn, Shadar. The spirit of Alicia talks to the dying Shadar, who realises that the girl he saved was the young Alicia herself. Shadar then uses his power to sever the link between himself and Oliver, in order to save Oliver from dying as well.|$|E
60|$|He moved a step nearer. This {{time she}} {{made no effort to}} retreat. Once more she was {{trembling}} a little, but her face was soft and sweet. All the pallor, the hard lines, the suffering seemed to have passed miraculously out of it. A soul--a woman's soul--was shining at him out of her eyes. It wasn't her physical self that spoke--in a way he knew that. Yet she was <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> with all she possessed, <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as <b>to</b> her master.|$|R

500|$|Wilson, Borrow and the 35 others {{made for}} Lobengula's enclosure. The king's wagon was still there, but when Wilson <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> {{there was no}} answer. The king had moved on during the night. At that moment, the troopers {{heard the sound of}} rifles being cocked in the wood {{surrounding}} them. A Matabele inDuna stepped out from behind a tree and announced that the enclosure was surrounded by thousands of Matabele who wanted to [...] "see if the white men were afraid to die." [...] He then fired his rifle to signal the start of the attack to his men. A volley from the Matabele riflemen followed, but most of the shots went too high; no Company trooper was hit. The only casualties of this opening volley were two of the patrol's horses. Wilson immediately ordered his men to fall back, first to an antheap, then to a thick wood. Three of them were wounded during this retreat, but none fatally.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain {{returned}} to London in triumph. Large crowds mobbed Heston, {{where he was}} met by the Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of Clarendon, who gave him a letter from King George VI assuring him of the Empire's lasting gratitude and urging him to come straight to Buckingham Palace to report. The streets were so packed with cheering people that it took Chamberlain {{an hour and a}} half to journey the nine miles (14km) from Heston to the Palace. After reporting to the King, Chamberlain and his wife appeared on the Palace balcony with the King and Queen. He then went to Downing Street; both the street and the front hall of Number 10 were packed. As he headed upstairs to address the crowd from a first-floor window, someone <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Neville, go up to the window and say 'peace for our time'." [...] Chamberlain turned around and responded, [...] "No, I don't do that sort of thing." [...] Nevertheless, Chamberlain recalled the words of his predecessor, Benjamin Disraeli and his return from the Congress of Berlin in his statement to the crowd: ...|$|E

2500|$|Ayres's men had faltered briefly {{when they}} became exposed to closer, more {{accurate}} firing from Ransom's brigade. Sheridan then rode along the battle line shouting encouragement. When a soldier {{was hit in the}} neck and fell shouting [...] "I'm killed!" [...] Sheridan <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> [...] "You're not hurt a bit, pick up your gun, man, and move right on to the front." [...] Reacting to Sheridan's words, the man stood up, picked up his gun and moved a dozen paces before he finally collapsed dead.|$|E

2500|$|Deploying {{with the}} army on 11 May 1745, {{the day of the}} battle' he {{unexpectedly}} found himself, on reaching the crest of a low hill, {{face to face with the}} Gardes Françaises, who, though anticipating an engagement as little as Hay, showed no sign of disorder. According to the French accounts, of which Voltaire's is the best known, Lord Charles stepped from the ranks and, in response to a similar movement promptly made by the French commander, politely <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> to order his people to fire, but in reply was assured, with equal politeness, that the French guards never fired first. According to the story which he himself sent in a letter to his brother three weeks later, his men came within twenty or thirty paces of the enemy, whereupon he advanced in front of the regiment, drank to the health of the French, bantered them with more spirit than pungency on their defeat at Dettingen, and then turned and called on his own men to huzzah, which they did. Hay recalled that [...] "it was our regiment that attacked the French Guards: and when we came to within twenty or thirty paces of them, I advanced before our regiment; drank to them and told them that we were the English Guards, and hoped they would stand till we came quite up to them, and not swim the Scheldt as they did the Main at Dettingen." ...|$|E
