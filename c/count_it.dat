5|$|In early 1973, the Soviet studio Mosfilm {{approached}} the filmmaker {{to ask if}} he would be interested in working with them. Kurosawa proposed an adaptation of Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev's autobiographical work Dersu Uzala. The book, about a Goldi hunter who lives in harmony with nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization, was one that he had wanted to make since the 1930s. In December 1973, the 63-year-old Kurosawa set off for the Soviet Union with four of his closest aides, beginning a year-and-a-half stay in the country. Shooting began in May 1974 in Siberia, with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding. The picture wrapped in April 1975, with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick Kurosawa returning to Japan and his family in June. Dersu Uzala had its world premiere in Japan on August 2, 1975, and did well at the box office. While critical reception in Japan was muted, the film was better reviewed abroad, winning the Golden Prize at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival, as well as an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Today, critics remain divided over the film: some see it as an example of Kurosawa's alleged artistic decline, while others <b>count</b> <b>it</b> among his finest works.|$|E

As the bobbin ran empty he would pick it off its skewer in the creel unreeling 30cm or so of roving, and drop it into a skip. With his left hand, he would place on the new bobbin onto the skewer from above and with his right hand twist in the new roving into the tail of the last.|$|E
25|$|Egyptologists such as Thomas Schneider, Michael Haase, and Rainer Stadelmann {{wonder if}} the {{compiler}} of the Turin Canon actually took into account that the cattle count was performed biennially {{during the first half}} of the Old Kingdom period, whilst tax collection during the 19th dynasty was held every year. In sum, all these documents would prove that Khufu ruled for at least 26 or 27 years, and possibly for over 34 years, if the inscription in the relieving chambers point to a biennial cattle count. Indeed, if the compiler of the Turin Canon did not take into account a biennial cattle <b>count,</b> <b>it</b> could even mean that Khufu ruled for 46 years.|$|E

25|$|Applying these {{concepts}} {{to a whole}} sequence is basic to higher strategy. If Black starts a sequence that properly ends in an even number of plays, Black retains sente in doing this. If Black starts a sequence that properly ends after an odd number of plays, Black loses sente and takes gote. Accepting gote should only be in return for some profitable exchange. Correct play in the yose (endgame) can consist of playing available sente sequences, and then taking the largest gote sequence on the board, though that description is a simplification. A reverse sente play is a special type of gote play, preventing the opponent from making some sente move. The relative value of reverse sente plays depends on the overall position, but one can <b>count</b> <b>it</b> as twice the value {{of what it would}} be if purely gote.|$|E
25|$|When {{composing}} The Planets Holst initially {{scored the}} work for four hands, two pianos, except for Neptune, which was scored for a single organ, as Holst believed that {{the sound of the}} piano was too percussive for a world as mysterious and distant as Neptune. Holst then scored the suite for a large orchestra, in which form it became enormously popular. Holst's use of orchestration was very imaginative and colourful, showing the influence of such contemporary composers as Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg, as well as such late Russian romantics as Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov. Its novel sonorities helped make the work an immediate success with audiences at home and abroad. Although The Planets remains Holst's most popular work, the composer himself did not <b>count</b> <b>it</b> among his best creations and later in life complained that its popularity had completely surpassed his other works. He was, however, partial to his own favourite movement, Saturn.|$|E
25|$|As seen above, {{voters in}} an STV {{election}} rank candidates on a preferential ballot. STV systems {{in use in}} different countries vary both as to ballot design and {{to whether or not}} voters are obliged to provide a full list of preferences. In jurisdictions such as the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland voters are permitted to rank as many or as few candidates as they wish. Consequently, voters sometimes, for example, rank only the candidates of a single party, or of their most preferred parties. A minority of voters, especially if they do not fully understand the system, might even 'bullet vote', only expressing a first preference. Allowing voters to rank only as many candidates as they wish grants them greater freedom, but can also lead to some voters ranking so few candidates that their vote eventually becomes 'exhausted'; that is, at a certain point during the <b>count</b> <b>it</b> can no longer be transferred and therefore loses an opportunity to influence the result.|$|E

25|$|Pashto is {{a provincial}} {{language}} spoken {{as a first}} language by about 15% of Pakistanis, mostly in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in Balochistan {{as well as by}} immigrants to the eastern provinces who are often not counted due to census irregularities. The Pashto has rich written literary traditions as well as an oral tradition. There are two major dialect patterns within which the various individual dialects may be classified; these are Pakhto, which is the Northern (Peshawar) variety, and the softer Pashto spoken in the southern areas. Khushal Khan Khattak (1613–1689) and Rahman Baba (1633–1708) were the most famous poets in the Pashto language. In {{the last part of the}} 20th century, Pakhto or Pashto has produced some great poets like Ghani Khan, Khatir Afridi and Amir Hamza Shinwari. There are also many Pakistanis from the adjacent regions of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan who are conversant in Pashto and <b>count</b> <b>it</b> as their second language.

25|$|Pre-election polls had {{predicted}} {{a close race}} and a hung parliament, but the surprising result was that a majority Conservative government was elected. The Conservatives with 37% {{of the popular vote}} held a narrow majority with 331 of the 650 seats. The other main victor was the Scottish National Party which won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland, a gain of 50. Labour suffered its worst defeat since 1987, taking only 31% of the votes and 232 seats; they lost 40 of their 41 seats in Scotland. The Liberal Democrats vote fell by 2/3 and they lost 49 of their 57 seats, as their coalition with the Conservatives had alienated the great majority of their supporters. The new UK Independence Party (UKIP), rallying voters against Europe and against immigration, did well with 13% of the vote <b>count.</b> <b>It</b> came in second in over 115 constituencies but came in first in only one.

25|$|The Max-Littmann-Saal was {{originally}} called Großer Saal (Great Hall). After {{the end of}} renovation in 2005 it was officially renamed after the architect Max Littmann. The hall of about 455 square meters is 36 meters long, 16 meters high and {{is surrounded by a}} large U-shaped gallery. In the case of row seating, the hall accommodates a maximum of 1,160 guests, in the parquet about 660 and on the gallery about 500 seats. It is used for concerts, but also for conferences. Experts <b>count</b> <b>it</b> to the best concert halls of the world. The paneling of cherry-wood gives the hall, which is of the “shoebox type”, a much acclaimed acoustics. Behind the panelling a gap of five to ten centimeters to the wall acts as resonance space. Measurements during the renovation of 2005 brought reverberation times of 1.1 to 1.8 seconds. These acoustics are similar to the Boston Symphony Hall or the Usher Hall in Edinburgh. So the Max-Littmann-Saal often was used for recordings of classical music. In the recent past the Philharmonie Festiva and the conductor Gerd Schaller produced CD recordings of symphonic works of Anton Bruckner, Johannes Brahms, and Franz Schubert, as well as the first recordings of the opera Merlin by Carl Goldmark and the Great Mass by Johann Ritter von Herbeck. Many concerts of the Kissinger Sommer are recorded in the Max-Littmann-Saal by the public broadcasting company Bayerischer Rundfunk. The hall is connected to the neighbouring halls Grüner Saal and Weißer Saal by big foldable doors, which make it possible to enlarge the capacity of the Max-Littmann-Saal.|$|E
