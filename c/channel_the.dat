40|$|The {{presynaptic}} nerve terminal is of key {{importance in}} {{communication in the}} nervous system. Its primary role is to release transmitter quanta on the arrival of an appropriate stimulus. The structural basis of these transmitter quanta are the synaptic vesicles that fuse with the surface membrane of the nerve terminal, to release their content of neurotransmitter molecules and other vesicular components. We subdivide the control of quantal release into two major classes: the processes that take place before the fusion of the synaptic vesicle with the surface membrane (the pre-fusion control) and the processes that occur after the fusion of the vesicle (the post-fusion control). The pre-fusion control is the main determinant of transmitter release. It is achieved by {{a wide variety of}} cellular components, among them <b>the</b> ion <b>channels.</b> There are reports of several hundred different ion <b>channel</b> molecules at <b>the</b> surface membrane of the nerve terminal, that for convenience can be grouped into eight major categories. They are <b>the</b> voltage-dependent calcium <b>channels,</b> <b>the</b> potassium <b>channels,</b> <b>the</b> calcium-gated potassium <b>channels,</b> <b>the</b> sodium <b>channels,</b> <b>the</b> chloride <b>channels,</b> <b>the</b> non-selective <b>channels,</b> <b>the</b> ligand gated <b>channels</b> and <b>the</b> stretch-activated <b>channels.</b> There are several categories of intracellular <b>channels</b> in <b>the</b> mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and the synaptic vesicles.

For example, if <b>the</b> <b>channels</b> among <b>the</b> selected users are orthogonal to each other, the desired signal does not suffer degradation because the precoding matrix is aligned with <b>the</b> <b>channel</b> of <b>the</b> desired signal perfectly.
