Micro-ADV, Preston tube, notch, pointer gauge, manometers and other hydraulic equipment {{have been used to}} measure 3 -d velocity, boundary shear stress, and water surface profile at different sections of the channels. The research investigates the modeling of water surface profile, distribution of longitudinal velocity, depth-averaged velocity, boundary shear stress and energy loss for overbank flow cases in both prismatic and non-prismatic sections of <b>converging</b> compound <b>channels.</b> As a complementary study to the experimental research, numerical hydrodynamic tools viz. ANSYS is applied to simulate the flow for both prismatic and non-prismatic sections of <b>converging</b> compound <b>channels.</b> All the important flow parameters are extracted numerically from the simulation results to study them vis a vis their observed values. As a prediction of flow variables in a non-prismatic <b>converging</b> compound <b>channel</b> is a much complex phenomenon, so an ANN has also been employed for prediction of depth-averaged velocity, boundary shear, and energy loss for different flow conditions. From the experimental study, new expressions for the water surface, energy loss and stage-discharge relationship for <b>converging</b> compound <b>channels</b> have been developed and validated with the present data and data sets from previous research projects.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some issues}} {{of the flow of}} ice in long and <b>converging</b> <b>channels</b> which may affect navigation. The emphasis is on pressure distributions and the role of ice properties and tidal currents. The present work employs an ice dynamics model that is based on a viscous plastic constitutive model with an elliptical yield envelope, the thickness redistribution model of Savage (2007), and a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) advection approach. Pressure distributions are obtained for an idealized geometry and uniform wind forcing. The results indicate that zones of relatively low pressures develop along the centre of the channel. Increasing the shear strength of the ice cover leads to somewhat lower pressures within such zones along the centre of the channel. That reduction of pressure is caused by the increased transfer of wind forces to land boundaries. Tides are shown to generally decrease pressures. The tidal currents also increase the overall drift, although drift slows and even reverses direction during parts of the tidal cycle. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
