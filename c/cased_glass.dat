50|$|Vasa Murrhina is a <b>cased</b> <b>glass,</b> {{the name}} means vessel of gems. This type of glass {{has a long}} history pre dating Fenton. Frank M. Fenton had glass chemist Charles Goe develop a way to make it since the way it was made was long forgotten. The piece starts out as a ball of glass that is rolled in small pieces of broken glass called frit. Then another layer of crystal was {{gathered}} over the frit.|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, Bohemia looked to the export trade and mass-produced {{coloured}} glass that was exported all over the world. Pairs of vases were produced either in a single colour of opaque glass or in two-colour <b>cased</b> <b>glass.</b> These were decorated in thickly enamelled flower subjects that were painted with great speed. Others were decorated with coloured lithographic prints copying famous paintings. These glass objects were made in huge quantities in large factories and were available by mail order throughout Europe and America. Many of them were not fine art but provided inexpensive decorative objects to brighten up ordinary homes. Reverse glass painting was also a Czech specialty. The image is carefully painted by hand on the back of a pane of glass, using a variety of techniques and materials, after which the painting is mounted in a bevelled wooden frame.|$|E

50|$|In an {{electronic}} {{inspection of the}} documents in 1995, conservators noticed changes in the glass encasements of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. Glass experts from Libby-Owens-Ford (the original manufacturer of the encasement glass) and the Corning Glass Museum determined that the <b>case</b> <b>glass</b> components were showing signs of deterioration. Both the glass experts and the National Archives Advisory Committee on Preservation recommended that the Charters be reencased within seven years (by 2002) to ensure the continued safety and preservation of the documents.|$|R

40|$|The overall {{electrical}} {{efficiency of the}} photovoltaic (PV) module can be increased by reducing {{the temperature of the}} PV module by withdrawing the thermal energy associated with the PV module. In this communication an attempt has been made to develop analytical expression for {{electrical efficiency}} of PV module with and without flow as a function of climatic and design parameters. The four different configurations of PV modules are considered for the present study which are defined as; <b>case</b> A (<b>Glass</b> to glass PV module with duct), <b>case</b> B (<b>Glass</b> to glass PV module without duct), <b>case</b> C (<b>Glass</b> to tedlar PV module with duct), <b>case</b> D (<b>Glass</b> to tedlar PV module without duct). Further, experiments were carried out for all configurations under composite climate of New Delhi. It is found that the glass to glass PV modules with duct gives higher electrical efficiency as well as the higher outlet air temperature amongst the all four cases. The annual effect on electrical efficiency of glass to glass type PV module with and without duct is also evaluated. The annual average efficiency of glass to glass type PV module with and without duct is 10. 41 % and 9. 75 %, respectively. Photovoltaic Electrical efficiency Solar radiation Thermal energy...|$|R
