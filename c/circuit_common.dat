5000|$|In an AC/DC design {{there was}} no {{transformer}} to isolate the equipment from the mains. Much equipment was built on a metal chassis which was connected {{to one side of}} the mains. [...] Because no power transformer was used, so-called [...] "hot chassis" [...] construction was required and the equipment power supply was conductively connected to the input power source. Any exposed metal on the device connected to the <b>circuit</b> <b>common</b> was also connected to the power supply. For safety, no exposed metal could be connected to the <b>circuit</b> <b>common.</b> Service personnel working on energized equipment had to use an isolation transformer for safety, or be mindful that the chassis could be live. AC-only vacuum tube equipment used a bulky, heavy, and expensive transformer, but the chassis was not connected to the supply conductors and could be earthed, making for safer operation.|$|E

50|$|In {{split-phase}} wiring, {{for example}} a duplex receptacle in a North American kitchen, devices may {{be connected with}} a cable that has three conductors, in addition to ground. The three conductors are usually coloured red, black, and white. The white serves as a common neutral, while the red and black each feed, separately, {{the top and bottom}} hot sides of the receptacle. Typically such receptacles are supplied from two circuit breakers in which the handles of two poles are tied together for a common trip. If two large appliances are used at once, current passes through both and the neutral only carries the difference in current. The advantage is that only three wires are required to serve these loads, instead of four. If one kitchen appliance overloads the circuit, {{the other side of the}} duplex receptacle will be shut off as well. This is called a multiwire branch <b>circuit.</b> <b>Common</b> trip is required when the connected load uses more than one phase simultaneously. The common trip prevents overloading of the shared neutral if one device draws more than rated current.|$|E

40|$|Resonant sensors {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of applications, e. g. as microbalances, {{chemical}} sensors in liquid and gaseous environments, and for physical property sensing of liquid and viscoelastic media. The signals obtained from these sensors are most often afflicted with unwanted or spurious components which, depending on sensor type and operating conditions, can be caused by parasitic sensor effects or by the implemented sensor interface <b>circuit.</b> <b>Common</b> ways of handling these effects by post-processing the sensor data usually reduce the dynamic range of the measurement interface due to the fact that a certain percentage of the input range is occupied by the unwanted signal components. In this contribution, a method of analog compensation for parasitic signal components is presented, which is implemented in a largely digital impedance analyzer circuit for resonating sensors. ...|$|E
40|$|An antenna, {{which may}} be a search coil, is {{connected}} to an operational amplifier circuit which provides negative impedances, {{each of which is}} in the order of magnitude of the positive impedances which characterize the antenna. The antenna is connected to the inverting input of the operational amplifier; a resistor is connected between the inverting input and the output of the operational amplifier; a capacitor-resistor network, in parallel, is connected between the output and the noninverting input of the operational amplifier; and a resistor is connected from the noninverting input and the <b>circuit</b> <b>common.</b> While this circuit provides a negative resistance and a negative inductance, in series, which appear, looking into the noninverting input of the operational amplifier, in parallel with the antenna, these negative impedances appear in a series loop with the antenna positive impedances, so as to algebraically add. This circuit is tuned by varying the various circuit components so that the negative impedances are very close, but somewhat less, in magnitude, to the antenna impedances. The result is to increase the sensitivity of the antenna by lowering its effective impedance. This, in turn, increases the effective area of the antenna, {{which may be}} broadband...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of bioelectric signals, e. g. the electrocardiogram and electromyogram (EMG), {{from the body}} is susceptible to noise, artefacts and interference; such as power-line interference. To reduce these effects differential-input amplifiers are commonly used. Rejection is further enhanced by implementing a referencing system into the design, such as connecting a third electrode to <b>circuit</b> <b>common</b> or driving the shields. However, {{there has been no}} quantitative study into the relative merits of the different systems. For this reason, an experimental analysis and computer simulation was undertaken. In the experimental tests, a rig and instrumentation system were developed to record the surface isometric EMG from biceps brachii. Published referencing systems were used in the trials and the recorded signals were quantified using repeatable parameters. These were calculated from the frequency domain and included the median frequency and a measure of the spectral power distribution. The results showed a significant reduction in the interference when a third electrode or isolation was used. No further reduction was observed if a more complex circuit, such as a driven referencing system, was used. In the computer simulation, a SPICE computer model of the recording environment was developed. This included the preamplifier and the interference sources from displacement currents induced into the leads and the body. The different referencing systems were incorporated within this basic structure. The results confirmed those from the experimental work and, by comparison to a 1 % tolerance criterion, it was concluded that the driven-right leg or the three electrode driven shield isolated systems were superior. It is concluded that referencing significantly affects interference levels on the bioelectric signal. These results may be used to facilitate a standard system to be adopted in bioelectric amplifiers. The implication for this in clinical practice is that it may improve the {{measurement of}} bioelectric signals...|$|E

40|$|A novel design {{approach}} for implementing millimeter wave wireless transceiver front-end circuits is proposed. The design methodology takes advantage in advances in Silicon Germanium (SiGe) fabrication technology and sophisticated Electro-Magnetic (EM) simulation software to ensure {{successful implementation of}} circuits designed to operate in millimeter wave range. The discussion covers basic <b>circuits</b> <b>common</b> in typical transceiver architecture such as low noise amplifier (LNA), active balun, and mixer. The design methodology {{is not limited to}} the above circuits. It can be applied to many other situations where operating frequency is high and the dimensions of passive structures are comparable to signal wavelength. A comprehensive solution to the design of millimeter wave wireless transceiver front-end circuits requires consideration for active devices as well as passive structures. For circuits operating at 94 GHz, 40 GHz and 18 GHz discussed in this dissertation, each design generally has two parts of discussion – one devoted to circuit design and one devoted to passive design. Optimization of circuit performance and reliability is analyzed in each case. Simulation results from both the circuits an...|$|R

5000|$|The period 1963-1965 {{is famous}} for the [...] "Cobra Ferrari Wars", a rivalry between American former-racing driver and Le Mans winner Carroll Shelby (Le Mans 1959, Aston Martin DBR1/300), and Enzo Ferrari, whose 250 GTs were the {{dominant}} grand touring cars of the time. Shelby retired from driving due to a heart condition, returning to California from Europe in 1959 with the idea to marry the AC Ace sports car chassis with Ford's V-8 small-block engine: the resulting Shelby AC Cobra was a sales success. Like Enzo, Shelby sold road cars to support his racing team, and like Ferrari the Cobra was a success on the track, {{at least on the}} short <b>circuits</b> <b>common</b> in the United States. On the longer tracks prevalent in Europe however, the Cobra's crude aerodynamics couldn't compete with the sleek 180 mph Ferrari 250 GTOs: even fitted with a hardtop removable roof the Cobra's top speed was 150 mph. At the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans, a Cobra placed 7th; Ferraris placed 1st to 6th. Shelby team engineer Pete Brock hand-designed a Kamm-backed aerodynamic body for the Cobra, creating the Shelby Daytona Coupe, and a showdown with Ferrari was set.|$|R
