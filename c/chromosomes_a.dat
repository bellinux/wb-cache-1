5|$|The total {{complement}} of genes in an organism or cell {{is known as}} its genome, which may be stored on one or more <b>chromosomes.</b> <b>A</b> chromosome consists of a single, very long DNA helix on which thousands of genes are encoded. The region of the chromosome at which a particular gene is located is called its locus. Each locus contains one allele of a gene; however, members of a population may have different alleles at the locus, each with a slightly different gene sequence.|$|E
5|$|Species are reproductively {{isolated}} {{by strong}} barriers to hybridisation, which include morphological differences, differing times of fertility, mating behaviors and cues, and physiological rejection of sperm cells or the developing embryo. Some act before fertilization and others after it. Similar barriers exist in plants, with differences in flowering times, pollen vectors, inhibition of pollen tube growth, somatoplastic sterility, cytoplasmic-genic male sterility {{and the structure}} of the <b>chromosomes.</b> <b>A</b> few animal species and many plant species, however, are the result of hybrid speciation, including important crop plants such as wheat, where the number of chromosomes has been doubled.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{strawberries}} have complex octaploid genetics (8 sets of <b>chromosomes),</b> <b>a</b> trait favoring DNA extractions. Strawberries {{have been}} sequenced to display 7,096 genes. Strawberries suffer from severe inbreeding depression, and most cultivars are highly heterozygous.|$|E
50|$|This {{is called}} {{aneuploidy}} (an abnormal number of chromosomes), and occurs {{when an individual}} either is missing <b>a</b> <b>chromosome</b> from <b>a</b> pair (monosomy) or has more than two <b>chromosomes</b> of <b>a</b> pair (trisomy, tetrasomy, etc.).|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} {{monosomy}} is Turner syndrome, where {{the individual is}} born with only one sex <b>chromosome,</b> <b>an</b> X.|$|R

25|$|Lomatia tasmanica, {{commonly}} known as King's lomatia, is a shrub from the family Proteaceae native to Tasmania. Growing up to 8 m tall, the plant has shiny green pinnate (lobed) leaves and bears red flowers in the summer, but yields neither fruit nor seeds. King's lomatia is unusual {{because all of the}} remaining plants are genetically identical. Because it has three sets of <b>chromosomes</b> (<b>a</b> triploid) and is therefore sterile, reproduction occurs only vegetatively: when a branch falls, that branch grows new roots, establishing a new plant that is genetically identical to its parent.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} in 1992 in two limited editions—Deluxe and Small—by Kevin Begos Jr. Publishing, New York City. The deluxe edition came in a 16 by 21½-inch (41cm × 55cm) metal mesh case sheathed in Kevlar (a polymer used to make bulletproof vests) and designed {{to look like a}} buried relic. Inside is a book of 93 ragged and charred pages sewn by hand and bound in stained and singed linen by Karl Foulkes; the book gives the impression of having survived a fire; it was described by Peter Schwenger as [...] "a black box recovered from some unspecified disaster." [...] The edition includes pages of DNA sequences set in double columns of 42 lines each like the Gutenberg Bible, and copperplate aquatint etchings by Ashbaugh editioned by Peter Pettingill on Fabriano Tiepolo paper. The monochromatic etchings depict stylised <b>chromosomes,</b> <b>a</b> hallmark of Ashbaugh's work, accompanied by imagery of a pistol, camera or in some instances simple line drawings—all allusions to Gibson's contribution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{small size}} of its genome, {{and the fact that}} it is diploid, makes Arabidopsis thaliana useful for genetic mapping and {{sequencing}} — with about 135 mega base pairs and five <b>chromosomes,</b> <b>A.</b> thaliana has one of the smallest genomes among plants. It was long thought to have the smallest genome of all flowering plants, but that title is now considered to belong to plants in the genus Genlisea, order Lamiales, with Genlisea tuberosa, a carnivorous plant, showing a genome size of approximately 61Mbp. It was the first plant genome to be sequenced, completed in 2000 by the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative. The most up-to-date version of the A. thaliana genome is maintained by the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR). Much work has been done to assign functions to its 27,000 genes and the 35,000 proteins they encode. Post-genomic research, such as metabolomics, has also provided useful insights to the metabolism of this species and how environmental perturbations [...] can affect metabolic processes.|$|E

30|$|In principle, {{crossover}} is {{a simple}} cut and swap operation. Due {{to the nature of}} constraint and <b>chromosome,</b> <b>a</b> modified crossover operation is required. In this study, crossover operation applying to both resource allocation and manufacturing sequence parts of <b>a</b> <b>chromosome</b> is proposed.|$|R
5000|$|Not all translocations of <b>chromosomes</b> carry <b>a</b> poorer prognosis. Some translocations are {{relatively}} favorable. For example, hyperdiploidy (>50 <b>chromosomes)</b> is <b>a</b> good prognostic factor.|$|R
2500|$|Some species {{reproduce}} {{exclusively by}} parthenogenesis (such as the Bdelloid rotifers), while others can switch between sexual reproduction and parthenogenesis. This is called facultative parthenogenesis (other terms are cyclical parthenogenesis, heterogamy or heterogony). The switch between sexuality and parthenogenesis in such species may {{be triggered by}} the season (aphid, some gall wasps), or {{by a lack of}} males or by conditions that favour rapid population growth (rotifers and cladocerans like daphnia). In these species asexual reproduction occurs either in summer (aphids) or as long as conditions are favourable. This is because in asexual reproduction a successful genotype can spread quickly without being modified by sex or wasting resources on male offspring who won't give birth. In times of stress, offspring produced by sexual reproduction may be fitter as they have new, possibly beneficial gene combinations. In addition, sexual reproduction provides the benefit of meiotic recombination between non-sister <b>chromosomes,</b> <b>a</b> process associated with repair of DNA double-strand breaks and other DNA damages that may be induced by stressful conditions.

Choh Hao Li discovered human growth hormone (and subsequently used it to treat a form of dwarfism caused by growth hormone deficiency), beta-endorphin (the most powerful of the body's natural painkillers), follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone (the key hormone used in fertility testing, an example is the ovulation home test).

40|$|Resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum) to the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor), a major {{insect pest}} of wheat, {{is based on}} a gene-for-gene interaction. Close linkage (3 +/- 2 cM) was {{discovered}} between Hessian fly avirulence genes vH 3 and vH 5. Bulked segregant analysis revealed two DNA markers (28 - 178 and 23 - 201) within 10 cM of these loci and only 3 +/- 2 cM apart. However, 28 - 178 was located {{in the middle of the}} short arm of Hessian fly <b>chromosome</b> <b>A</b> 2 whereas 23 - 201 was located in the middle of the long arm of <b>chromosome</b> <b>A</b> 2, suggesting the presence of severe recombination suppression over its proximal region. To further test that possibility, an AFLP-based genetic map of the Hessian fly genome was constructed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of 20 markers on the genetic map to the polytene chromosomes of the Hessian fly indicated good correspondence between the linkage groups and the four Hessian fly chromosomes.
