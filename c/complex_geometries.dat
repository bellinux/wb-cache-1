40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of flow over <b>complex</b> <b>geometry</b> needs accurate and efficient computational methods. Different techniques {{are available to}} handle <b>complex</b> <b>geometry.</b> The unstructured grid and multi-block body-fitted grid techniques have been widely adopted for <b>complex</b> <b>geometry</b> in engineering applications. In atmospheric applications, terrain fitted single grid techniques have found common use. Although these are very effective techniques, their implementation, coupling with the flow algorithm, and efficient parallelization of the complete method are more involved than a Cartesian grid method. The grid generation can be tedious and one needs to pay special attention in numerics to handle skewed cells for conservation purposes. Researchers have long sought for alternative methods to ease the effort involved in simulating flow over <b>complex</b> <b>geometry...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thin-walled fiber {{reinforced}} concrete (FRC) elements are being adapted for large scale buildings with <b>complex</b> <b>geometry</b> envelopes. The current production methods, {{developed in the}} initial stages of glass fiber {{reinforced concrete}} FRC elements in the 1970 s, are limited when striving to produce more complex shaped FRC elements. The limitations of the FRC elements in terms of material properties and surface quality were described for these current state of the art production methods. New production methods and casting techniques were proposed that will advance the application of thin-walled FRC for buildings with <b>complex</b> <b>geometry</b> envelopes. Evaluation of {{the current state of the}} art production methods concluded that the sprayed glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC) methods are currently the most flexible solution which has the greatest potential for adapting the method to the requirements of <b>complex</b> <b>geometry</b> buildings. Further development of thin-walled GFRC elements would be possible by developing a mold system for <b>complex</b> <b>geometry</b> panels with an edge-return, which can utilize GF-UHPC with a vacuum technology, making it possible to produce <b>complex</b> <b>geometry</b> GFRC elements with an increased material performance and yet still meet the aesthetic requirements of minimal visual defects in the surface of thin-walled elements...|$|R
25|$|Shell mold casting is a {{metal casting}} process similar to sand casting, in that molten metal is poured into an {{expendable}} mold. However, in shell mold casting, the mold is a thin-walled shell created from applying a sand-resin mixture around a pattern. The pattern, a metal {{piece in the}} shape of the desired part, is reused to form multiple shell molds. A reusable pattern allows for higher production rates, while the disposable molds enable <b>complex</b> <b>geometries</b> to be cast. Shell mold casting requires the use of a metal pattern, oven, sand-resin mixture, dump box, and molten metal.|$|E
25|$|Not {{all works}} during this era were {{on such a}} large scale. Indeed, the {{commission}} Bernini received to build the church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale for the Jesuits was relatively modest in physical size (though great in its interior chromatic splendor), which Bernini executed completely free of charge. Sant'Andrea shared with the St. Peter's piazza—unlike the <b>complex</b> <b>geometries</b> of his rival Francesco Borromini—a focus on basic geometric shapes, circles and ovals to create spiritually intense buildings. Equally, Bernini moderated the presence of colour and decoration within these buildings, focussing visitors' attention on these simple forms that underpinned the building. Sculptural decoration was never eliminated, but its use was more minimal. He also designed the church of Santa Maria dell'Assunzione {{in the town of}} Ariccia with its circular outline, rounded dome and three-arched portico.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{notion of}} being Moishezon {{to a set}} of types, a natural {{strengthening}} of internality motivated by <b>complex</b> <b>geometry,</b> is introduced. Under the hypothesis of Pillay’s [6] canonical base property, and using results of Chatzidakis [2], it is shown that if a stationary type of finite U-rank at least two is almost internal to a nonmodular minimal type and admits a diagonal section, then it is Moishezon to the set of nonmodular minimal types. This result is inspired by Campana’s [1] “first algebraicity criterion ” in <b>complex</b> <b>geometry.</b> Other related abstractions from <b>complex</b> <b>geometry,</b> including coreductions and generating fibrations are also discussed. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) {{is among}} the hardest of all tool {{materials}} and is therefore extremely resistant to wear. [...] It consists of a layer of diamond particles, typically about [...] thick, bonded as a sintered mass to a tungsten-carbide support. Bits are fabricated using this material by either brazing small segments {{to the tip of}} the tool to form the cutting edges or by sintering PCD into a vein in the tungsten-carbide [...] "nib". [...] The nib can later be brazed to a carbide shaft; it can then be ground to <b>complex</b> <b>geometries</b> that would otherwise cause braze failure in the smaller [...] "segments". PCD bits are typically used in the automotive, aerospace, and other industries to drill abrasive aluminum alloys, carbon-fiber reinforced plastics, and other abrasive materials, and in applications where machine downtime to replace or sharpen worn bits is exceptionally costly. It should be noted that PCD is not used on ferrous metals due to excess wear resulting from a reaction between the carbon in the PCD and the iron in the metal.|$|E
2500|$|The terms fractal {{dimension}} and fractal were coined by Mandelbrot in 1975, {{about a decade}} after he published his paper on self-similarity in the coastline of Britain. Various historical authorities credit him with also synthesizing centuries of complicated theoretical mathematics and engineering work and applying them {{in a new way}} to study <b>complex</b> <b>geometries</b> that defied description in usual linear terms. The earliest roots of what Mandelbrot synthesized as the {{fractal dimension}} have been traced clearly back to writings about undifferentiable, infinitely self-similar functions, which are important in the mathematical definition of fractals, around the time that calculus was discovered in the mid-1600s. There was a lull in the published work on such functions for a time after that, then a renewal starting in the late 1800s with the publishing of mathematical functions and sets that are today called canonical fractals (such as the eponymous works of von Koch, Sierpiński, and Julia), but {{at the time of their}} formulation were often considered antithetical mathematical [...] "monsters". These works were accompanied by perhaps the most pivotal point in the development of the concept of a fractal dimension through the work of Hausdorff in the early 1900s who defined a [...] "fractional" [...] dimension that has come to be named after him and is frequently invoked in defining modern fractals.|$|E
40|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>geometry</b> and {{symplectic}} geometry are mirrors in string theory. The recently developed generalised <b>complex</b> <b>geometry</b> interpolates {{between the two}} of them. On the other hand, the classical and quantum mechanics of a finite number of degrees of freedom are respectively described by a symplectic structure and a complex structure on classical phase space. In this letter we analyse the role played by generalised <b>complex</b> <b>geometry</b> in the classical and quantum mechanics of a finite number of degrees of freedom. We identify generalised <b>complex</b> <b>geometry</b> as an appropriate geometrical setup for dualities. The latter are interpreted as transformations connecting points in the interior of the Planck cone with points in the exterior, and viceversa. The Planck cone bears some resemblance with the relativistic light-cone. However the latter cannot be traversed by physical particles, while dualities do connect the region outside the Planck cone with the region inside, and viceversa. Comment: 9 page...|$|R
