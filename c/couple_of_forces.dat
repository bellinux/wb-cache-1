40|$|Feedback between {{training}} and competition {{should be considered}} in athletic training. The aim of the study was contemporary coaching tendencies in women s and men s judo with particular focus on a biomechanical classification of throws and grappling actions. Throwing technique frequencies grouped in the seven biomechanical classes were dependent on gender. A significant difference was found between frequencies of variable arm of physical lever technique scored by males and females as compared to the techniques counts. Significant differences between men who competed in extra lightweight and heavy weight concerned the frequency of the techniques used with maximum arm or variable arm of physical lever and a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> applied by trunk and legs. In females a tendency to higher frequency of techniques that used <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> applied by arm or arms and leg was observed in extra lightweight compared to the heavy weight. Because the technique preferred in the fight depends on a gender and weight category of a judoka, the relationships found in this study, which can be justified by the biomechanics of throws, should be taken into consideration in technical and tactical coaching of the contestants. A method used in this study can be recommended for future research concerning coaching tendenciesComment: 13 pages 11 figures 6 tables extended version with effectiveness of throw...|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} research is the evaluation of lateral-torsional buckling resistance and actual behaviour of the beams due to absence of standards for design of glass load-bearing structures. The experimental research follows the previous one focusing on measuring of initial geometrical imperfections of glass members and experimental evaluation of flexural buckling resistance of structural glass columns.

A mesoscopic model is also used, in which the size of the bacteria is supposed to be much smaller than the elements of fluid: the perturbation of the fluid due to propulsion and motion of the swimmers is neglected, and the fluid is only subjected to the buoyant forcing induced by the presence of the bacteria, which are denser than the fluid.

It {{was part of a}} flood control project in the Savinja River basin. The main span is 74 m long; the overall length of the {{footbridge}} is 147. 5 m. The total weight of the steel structure is approximately 160 t. The maximum height of the cross-section is 1490 mm. Steel segments were fabricated in a workshop and welded on site (on the old footbridge, which stood near the new footbridge). After welding the 87. 5 m long and 112 t heavy steel structure was lifted and mounted with two mobile cranes (one on each bank of the river). The footbridge is fixed to a piled concrete block {{on one side of the}} river and simply supported on the other side, where longitudinally moveable compression and tensile supports act as a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> (reactions). Special instructions were prepared for the contractor to introduce proper moments into the fixed support. The footbridge was designed as a composite steel-concrete structure. Trapezoidal cross-section of the main span was designed as a steel box girder with variable height, inclined web and a thin reinforced concrete slab. Steel plates were made as orthotropic plates with longitudinal stiffeners. Where heights of the trapezoidal cross-section are low (minimum 0. 53 m), orthotropic plates are also used as “lost formwork” for the concrete slab. The thickness of steel plates ranges from 10 mm in middle span to 60 mm near bearings. The steel structure itself has a critical first natural frequency. The addition of the concrete slab ensures acceptable behavior of the bridge construction, which does not come in resonance any more. Reinforcement with concrete slab adds additional resistance and stiffness to the load bearing structure...|$|E

40|$|Vortex {{structures}} (monopoles, dipoles, quadrupoles) {{as well as}} {{more complex}} structures (vortex streets) are fundamental elements of geophysical turbulence. Because they can effectively transport momentum, heat, salt and biochemical products, they play an essential role in ocean dynamics. Organized vortex structures are a well-known feature of quasi-two-dimensional flows where motion in one direction is suppressed due to one of the following physical mechanisms: background rotation of the system, density stratification or geometrical restrictions such as for the flows in thin layers or soap films. [...] Vortex dipoles are formed in a viscous fluid when a force is applied locally to some volume of fluid. If the force acts impulsively, a translating vortex dipole is generated. If the force starts at t = 0 and then acts continuously a starting jet with a dipole at its front is generated. Solutions for unsteady viscous flows generated by the action of continuous or impulsive localized forces are obtained in Oseen approximation. The solutions are compared with direct numerical simulations of vortex dipoles as well as with laboratory experiments. The comparison shows good quantitative agreement in both cases. [...] A physical problem where the localized force acting continuously on fluid is placed in a uniform stream is equivalent to a problem of a fixed body in a uniform stream, while the <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> acting in opposite direction are equivalent to the problem of self-propelled body moving at constant velocity through a fluid.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this article, a {{theoretical}} model is proposed on closure of mode-I crack in matrix embedded with prestrained {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) fiber as an actuator. To overcome fiber de-bonding in matrix, two knots are made on a SMA fiber.

This <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> recovery <b>forces</b> may restrain opening of the mode-I crack. Based on Tanaka constitutive law on SMA fiber and complex stress function near an elliptic hole under a point load, we have an analytical expression of relation between stress intensity factor (SIF) of mode-I crack closure and temperature in SMA fiber. Simulation results show that SIF of mode-I crack closure decreases obviously with the rise in temperature higher than the austenite start temperature of SMA fiber, {{and that there is}} an optimal position for SMA fiber to restrain crack opening, which is behind the crack tip.

The first approach is based on frequency-response analysis of the gyroscope output.

For a fundamental class of systems exemplified by a time-delayed Shimizu-Yamada model for muscular contractions, we established that the variability is an invertible one-to-one mapping <b>of</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>forces</b> and time delays and that coupling forces and time delays have opposite effects on system variability, allowing time delays to annihilate the impact <b>of</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>forces.</b> Furthermore, we showed how variability measures {{could be used to}} determine coupling parameters and time delays from experimental data. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} of Rita {{has been well}} received by critics, who praised Benz’s portrayal. Eric Goldman of IGN has said, “Dexter does a solid job of developing {{the roles of the}} supporting cast, with Rita, Deb, Doakes and LaGuerta all getting a good amount of development”. He added, “There were a <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>forced</b> moments in [...] "Popping Cherry", most notably the drug dealer who came to Rita's house, in broad daylight, demanding money for her ex-husband's debts; it was all a bit over the top and cliché. On the other hand, it was interesting to note Dexter's inaction in that scene, making one wonder if perhaps he fears that any public display of physical defense, even for Rita, might result in him going too far and revealing what he is." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post has said, [...] "Rita always felt like the light in that dark show", and [...] "In the beginning Rita was the vessel through which the audience could love Dexter." [...] UGO.com placed Rita Bennett 7th on a list of [...] "Top 11 Girlfriends on TV". Zap2it created a poll entitled [...] "Best Mom" [...] as part of their [...] "Greatest TV Characters" [...] series of polls; Rita was voted 12th on a list of 14 characters.|$|R
