40|$|The {{quality and}} safety of {{colonoscopy}} have become of paramount importance with the worldwide expansion in the utilisation of this procedure, especially {{with the introduction of}} colorectal cancer screening in many countries. It is well known that colonoscopic performance varies significantly between practitioners. This thesis explores the effects of assessment in colonoscopy and polypectomy on performance and practice as well as trying to define the factors which differentiate the very best practitioners from the clinically competent. Until 2011, there was no formalised way of certifying polypectomy competence. We looked at the effects of the introduction of mandatory polypectomy assessment on trainee endoscopists applying for <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>competency</b> in the United Kingdom. This work showed that documentation of polypectomy competence significantly improved after these changes were introduced. A global survey of polypectomy practice was undertaken to evaluate international guidance on polypectomy skills training and how trainers deliver teaching on polypectomy around the world, as well as trainees’ experience of gaining polypectomy skills. Significant variability in endoscopists’ experience of polypectomy training was found with few formal national guidelines published. This led to an evaluation of expert endoscopists who underwent an accreditation process with some similarities before commencing Bowel Cancer Screening (BCS). We examined whether it was possible to predict future performance from a single assessment and found that criteria used to assess whether candidates were competent could not predict the best performers from those who passed. Several hundred expert BCS colonoscopists were then monitored over a three year period to determine changes in performance over time and whether long-term performance could be predicted. The best predictors of performance over time for all metrics were initial performance. In order to identify key features of expertise in endoscopy, experienced colonoscopists were interviewed to distinguish characteristics of true endoscopic experts. These interviews revealed the importance of both technical and non-technical skills in defining expertise. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|QuTE (Quality in Training and evaluation) is {{a digital}} {{platform}} {{that can be}} used for monitoring and evaluating the quality assurance in the main dimensions of the educational process: planning, delivery, satisfaction and impact assessment. The comprehension of the quality responds to the question of the transparency and control by the citizen, who is directly involved in the social choices and wants to participate in making political decisions. The transparency concept is connected to the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> the learning outcomes and educational procedures (UNESCO, 2011 : 11 - 12). In the first case, within the European Community a common code for the instructional and educational systems has been shared (EQF), through which the mobility and lifelong learning, as well as the recognition and validation of the non-formal and informal learning, are guaranteed. In the second case, Common Quality Assurance Framework (CQAF) is an instrument of support, introduced by the EU, for developing and improving the quality, which starts from monitoring and evaluation of the ongoing systems and educational practices QuTE does not look at the quality <b>of</b> <b>competencies</b> and performances <b>of</b> those delivering the service or at the <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>competencies</b> acquired, but the focus shifts to the quality of the educational processes, which represent the basis for the achievement of the attended learning outcomes. The software provides procedural indications, tools for analysis, monitoring and evaluation strategies for checking the different levels <b>of</b> <b>competencies</b> in an innovative perspective. The objective of reaching quality responds, therefore, to the continuous need for qualification and updating of internal competences of an organization, as well as for identifying and reducing the functional weaknesses in order to be competitive at the market. The main goal of the software is to standardize the educational procedures of action and of learning evaluation, emphasizing more effective strategies and methods and reducing methodological lacks. The starting point of this paper is focused on quality parameters of an educational process. In particular, the paper will deepen the matter of the quality in the operative processes, starting from the international shared parameters. To achieve this goal, we structure and put forward a model of the quality analysis. From the methodological point of view, the structure of the techniques and tools for data collection is in line with the indications of the CQAF. We re-contextualize the main indicators, we build the connected variables, we attribute them a semantic weight and we create a quality index, in order to verify the educational effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{efforts are}} being made {{to improve the quality}} of biology {{education}} in Germany and develop tests to assess student achievement. With the introduction of national science education standards in 2005, there has been a growing need for criterion-oriented tests, i. e. tests that assess whether or not a specific level <b>of</b> <b>competency</b> has been reached. Here we present an approach to measuring students levels <b>of</b> <b>competencies</b> in experimentation. In particular, the focus lies on the <b>competencies</b> <b>of</b> forming hypotheses, planning experiments and analysing data. These competencies were selected because they are crucial to experimentation as problem-solving, according to the SDDS model (Klahr 2000), and because they are central to the newly introduced Biology standards. One specific reference point of this study is the international scientific literacy test for PISA 2000. Five levels <b>of</b> <b>competencies</b> were proposed for PISA 2000. Items were mapped onto the levels <b>of</b> <b>competencies</b> by dividing up the maximum total sum score into five segments and by assigning items with a low/high difficulty to a low/high level <b>of</b> <b>competency.</b> The approach chosen in the present study differs, as closed-end test items were developed with response categories that can be directly related to a specific level <b>of</b> <b>competency.</b> Each item could be answered in different ways that are indicative of a particular level <b>of</b> <b>competency.</b> Item development, thus, took into consideration the rich research literature on qualitative differences among levels <b>of</b> <b>competencies</b> in experimentation...|$|R
