40|$|Abstract: A 3 D {{finite element}} model of bolt {{composite}} joint has been established to determine the stress distribution on the contact surface. The effects of <b>clamping</b> <b>torque</b> and friction on the contact stress and interlaminar normal stress are considered. From the analysis results, contact stress is bared mainly by the 0 ° layer. The distribution and magnitude of contact stress are conducted by friction. The effect of <b>clamping</b> <b>torque</b> on interlaminar normal stress is very strong. A 3 D damage user subroutine {{is added to the}} FEM to simulate the damage of joint. By the means of damage simulation, the initiation and progression direction of three types damage are predicted. Matrix cracking and fiber-matrix shear occur at first, and fiber buckling is founded subsequently. The matrix cracking and fiber-matrix debonding initiate at circumferential angle 45 °and 135 °, and fiber buckling initiate at the 0 ° layer on the bearing plane. The friction and bolt <b>clamping</b> <b>torque</b> can restrain damage initiation and development...|$|E
40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} Membrane (PEM) {{fuel cell}} is an electrochemical device producing electricity by {{the reaction of}} hydrogen and oxygen without combustion. PEM fuel cell stack is provided with an appropriate <b>clamping</b> <b>torque</b> to prevent leakage of reactant gases and to minimize the contact resistance between gas diffusion media (GDL) and bipolar plates. GDL porous structure and gas permeability is directly affected by the compaction pressure which, consequently, drastically change the fuel cell performance. Various {{efforts were made to}} determine the optimal compaction pressure and pressure distributions through simulations and experimentation. Lower compaction pressure results in increase of contact resistance and also chances of leakage. On the other hand, higher compaction pressure decreases the contact resistance but also narrows down the diffusion path for mass transfer from gas channels to the catalyst layers, consequently, lowering cell performance. The optimal cell performance is related to the gasket thickness and compression pressure on GDL. Every stack has a unique assembly pressure due to differences in fuel cell components material and stack design. Therefore, there is still need to determine the optimal torque value for getting the optimal cell performance. This study has been carried out in continuation of development of Air breathing PEM fuel cell for small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) application. Compaction pressure at minimum contact resistance was determined and <b>clamping</b> <b>torque</b> value was calculated accordingly. Single cell performance tests were performed at five different <b>clamping</b> <b>torque</b> values i. e 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 N m, for achieving optimal cell performance. Clamping pressure distribution tests were also performed at these torque values to verify uniform pressure distribution at optimal torque value. Experimental and theoretical results were compared for making inferences about optimal cell performance. A <b>clamping</b> <b>torque</b> value of 1. 5 N m was determined experimentally to be the best for getting optimal performance as well as uniform pressure distribution for this specific fuel cell...|$|E

After an initial bolt movement, the load vs bolt displacement plots are linear until the joints fail or the stiffness reduces significantly.

40|$|Fuel cells face major {{challenges}} in sustaining the laboratory-scale performance during the scale up. The contact resistance mainly {{arises from the}} dimensional mismatch between gasket and gas diffusion layer during scale up, which may cause diminution in performance. In the present work, experiment as well as modelling is carried out for different combinations of clamping force and gasket thickness. The polarisation behaviours of PEFCs configured under different <b>clamping</b> <b>torques</b> and gasket thicknesses are analysed. The combination of 0. 3 [*]mm gasket and 0. 3 [*]mm GDL under 3 [*]Nm and 5 [*]Nm clamping forces offers 480 [*]mΩ[*]cm 2 and 148 [*]mΩ[*]cm 2 contact resistances, respectively.

40|$|The wire–bolt {{interface}} in an Ilizarov frame {{has been}} mechanically tested. The optimal torque {{to be applied}} to the frame locking-bolts during physiological loading has been defined. The set-up configuration was as is used clinically except a copper tube was used to simulate bone. The force–displacement curves of the Ilizarov wires are not altered by locking-bolt torque. The force in the bone model at which pre-tension is lost increases as the locking-bolts are tightened to 14 Nm torque, but decreases if torque exceeds 14 Nm. Thus, 14 Nm is the optimal locking-bolt torque in frame. The relationship between pre-tension versus load for different locking-bolt torques arises because at low and high <b>clamping</b> <b>torques</b> poor wire holding and plastic deformation respectively occur. Wire damage was seen under light and electron microscopy. Clinically, over or under-tightening locking-bolts will cause loss of pre-tension, reduction in frame stiffness and excessive movement at the fracture site, which may be associated with delayed union...|$|R
40|$|Abstract − The {{achievement}} of a proper and uniform pressure distribution between the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and the bipolar plates of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) {{is a key}} factor of stack design and assembly. Contact pressure levels are usually controlled by selecting an appropriate external clamping pressure on the endplates. Very {{few studies have been}} focused on the measurement of the contact pressure distribution within the fuel cell and its correlation with the applied external <b>clamping</b> <b>torque.</b> This study explores the possibility of using matrix-based piezoresistive thin-film sensors, to be placed between the MEA and the monopolar plate of a PEMFC, to investigate this correlation. Before embedding the sensor array into the fuel cell, it was validated for accuracy and repeatability by designing a pneumatic calibration device which allows to apply uniform static pressure levels over the whole sensor area. Preliminary results reported in this study showed that, as the <b>clamping</b> <b>torque</b> on the endplates is increased, the average pressure on the MEA remains almost constant but its distribution changes.

Polymer {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cells}} (PEMFC) are the devices that directly convert Chemical energy into Electrical energy and are potential candidates for portable and stationary power supply applications {{due to their}} several advantages over combustion engines. This study {{has been carried out}} to develop Air breathing and air cooling PEM Fuel cell stack for small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) application with a power re- quirement of 200 W. Keeping in view the available space and weight constraints of UAV, I have optimally designed the shape of active area (10 cm x 2 cm) and ow channels. Fluid ow analysis using ANSYS Fluent software was performed on dierent channel shapes and an optimal design (double serpentine), with least pressure drop and optimal velocity proles, was selected. Electro-chemical simulations were also done to predict the fuel cell performance (IV and Power curves) using MATLAB software prior manufacturing the prototype. Moreover, for the sake of DOE targets, initial tests were performed on single cell. Bipolar plates were more focused in terms of alternate material, novel design and fabrication process. An alternate fabrication technique was studied to manufacture Ex- panded Graphite (EG) polymer composite bipolar plates. Cutting molds were designed to cut channels on thin (0. 6 mm) commercially acquired EG sheets. Three separate sheets, with ow channel textures removed, were glued to each other by a commercial conductive epoxy to build a single bipolar plate. The nal product was characterized in terms of electro-mechanical properties as well as density, weight and cost. Fabrica- tion process devised can be good alternate for small scale as well as mass production. Moreover, a PEM fuel cell stack is provided with an appropriate <b>clamping</b> <b>torque</b> to prevent leakage of reactant gases and to minimize the contact resistance between gas diusion media (GDL) and bipolar plates. GDL porous structure and gas permeability is directly aected by the compaction pressure which consequently drastically change the fuel cell performance.

30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} typical {{relationships}} obtained for tightening angle versus <b>clamp</b> force, tightening <b>torque,</b> and thread torque. In C. japonica, tightening torque and thread torque follow {{the profile of}} clamp force: first rising, then falling after reaching a peak value. The initial, sharp rise in tightening torque and thread torque is likely the initial driving torque when the lag screw head pressed against the bearing surface. Similar behavior was observed in P. menziesii at all tightening speeds and in C. obtusa at tightening speeds of 10 and 20  rpm. In all test specimens of C. obtusa at tightening speeds of 1 and 4  rpm, however, jagged, ‘sawtooth’ patterns are apparent in the relationships between tightening angle and <b>clamp</b> force, tightening <b>torque,</b> and thread torque. During the experiments, the wooden members were heard to creak, suggesting these fluctuations were due to stick-slip behavior between the lag screw thread and the main member. When major stick-slip occurs, the resultant clamp force is predicted to be highly variable, even if a torque control method were applied.|$|R

40|$|Damping torque {{analysis}} is a well-developed technique for understanding and studying power system oscillations. This paper presents the applications of <b>clamping</b> <b>torque</b> analysis for DC bus implemented clamping control in power transmission networks in two examples. The first {{example is the}} investigation of clamping effect of shunt voltage source converter (VSC) based flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) voltage control, i. e. static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) voltage control. It {{is shown in the}} paper that STATCOM voltage control mainly contributes synchronous torque and hence has little effect on the clamping of power system oscillations. The second example is the damping control implemented by a battery energy storage system (BESS) installed in a power system. Damping torque analysis reveals that when BESS clamping control is realized by regulating exchange of active and reactive power between the BESS and power system, respectively. BESS damping control exhibits different properties. It is concluded by damping torque analysis that BESS clamping control implemented by regulating active power is better with less interaction with BESS voltage control and more robust to variations of power system operating conditions.

40|$|Abstract. A {{theoretical}} {{study has}} been made on the cam-clamping device. In this article, we consider specifically the calculations of cam geometry, calculations of clamping force and <b>clamping</b> <b>torque,</b> conditions for self-locking, and conditions for contact strength. Machine fixtures are essential {{in the process of}} mechanical manufacturing. There are many different types of fixtures, such as manual jig, pneumatic clamps, hydraulic fixtures, electric fixtures, etc. There are also many ways of clamping, such as incline clamp, screw clamp, eccentric circle clamp, hinge clamp [1], among which the eccentric circle clamp finds wide applications, especially in fast-clamping devices. Although the circular eccentric fixture possesses the advantages of simple structure, convenient manufacturing, and low cost, it suffers the drawbacks of small clamping force, short clamping-surface travel distance, and unreliable self-locking mechanism. The cam-clamping device discussesed in this article involves replaceing the eccentric circle with a cam, as shown in Fig. 1. The cam profile curve can be designed according to any requirements. The advantages of this replacement are obvious, in addition to preserving the advantages of the circular eccentric fixture, the cam-clamping can be designed according to the actual needs of clamping paths and selection of the appropriate cam profile to improve the self-locking...|$|E

In particular, the influence of mechanical properties of seal joints and <b>clamping</b> bolt <b>torques</b> on the electrical performance is studied experimentally. It is demonstrated that rigid seal joints improve the electrical performance in comparison with the soft seal joints. Concerning the influence of the bolt torques, a certain optimal value is found for different types of MEA. The numerical modelling of mechanical stresses in running fuel cell is made. The developed model includes the main components of a real fuel cell (the membrane, the gas diffusion layers, the graphite plates, and the seal joints) and the clamping elements (the steel plates, the bolts, and the nuts).

Major stick-slip behavior was observed in C. obtusa based {{on the relationship of}} tightening angle with <b>clamp</b> force, tightening <b>torque,</b> and thread torque at tightening speeds of 1 and 4  rpm. In addition, tightening speed’s effects on the torque coefficient (K) varied depending on the wood species of the main member.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental campaign aimed at understanding the limitations and capabilities of non-linear elastic wave spectroscopy (NEWS) non-destructive technique (NDT) methods {{in the presence}} of variable boundary conditions. In particular, the objective was to understand if the contact between the structures Under investigation and the clamps used to hold the structures could generate non-classical non-linear effects that could affect the damage detection process by producing false-positive indications of defects presence. Two different techniques were analysed with varying degree <b>clamping</b> <b>torque.</b> The first approach evaluates the resonance frequency shift {{as a function of the}} external load amplitude, and it is called non-linear resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (NRUS). The second method used, called non-linear wave modulation spectroscopy (NWMS), monitors the generation of sidebands and harmonics when the structure is excited by a double tone external load. The results showed that the non-classical hysteretical non-linear effects were dependent on the boundary conditions, highlighted by the presence of resonance shift and harmonics and sidebands in an undamaged sample. This research shows that more work is needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods and the ease of implementation in a structural health monitoring system and further research studies and methodology development are needed to discern non-classical non-linear effects generated by contacts between mating parts (clamps and sample) from that generated due to the presence of damage.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of the clamping force in the technique {{used in this study}} to stretch-bend low carbon steel samples was investigated to support the subsequent changes in the microstructure and properties of the formed material with regard to parent material. Although plastic deformation by cold working is known to induce texture or preferred orientation to the grains of a formed material while decreasing its ductility and increasing the strength, as well as inducing residual stress, it is not known how the different directions (rolling, transverse and oblique/ 45 °) of the sheet steel will respond to this stretch bending technique. The first part of the research work involved a thorough literature review on sheet metal forming processes and their effect on the formed material with interest on the above mentioned directions of the sheet. It became clear from the literature overview that cold working of a material will induce strain-hardening which varies with the magnitude of cold work, resulting in changes in the strength and ductility of the material. Besides, when plastic deformation is not uniform (e. g., tensile and compressive) throughout the entire cross section of the formed part, residual stresses remain in the material with the grains been elongated along the direction of the maximum strain. The main parameters that were considered and controlled in this study are as follows: strain experienced / stress induced into the form sample, the sample direction, the stroke length and the <b>clamping</b> <b>torque,</b> the generated radius of curvature. The chapters that follow the literature review, deal with the set-up of the different equipment used in this study, the specimen preparation as well as the recording, the calculation and interpretation of the results. It was found that the stress magnitude that generated the different radii of curvature (120 mm, 150 mm and 185 mm) was between 1 percent & 13 percent higher than the parent material’s yield strength with the lower stress been associated to the smaller radius of curvature and the higher stress to the higher radius. The stress induced into the sample during forming was not only proportional to the stroke length but also to the distance between the punch’s tip and the sample and the sample to the die’s nadir. The <b>clamping</b> <b>torque</b> adopted was restricted to the manual capacity of the operator who used a preset torque wrench to fasten the plate sample into the jig. Plate samples of low carbon steel were cut to angles of 0 °, 45 °, and 90 ° to the rolling direction of the sheet material and stretch-bent on a single-action mechanical press to 120 mm, 150 mm, and 185 mm radii of curvature. The preliminary results indicate that stretch-bent samples had increased hardness to the parent plate, in particular below the surface layers up to around 1. 1 mm depth. Since there is a well established relationship between hardness, yield and tensile strengths for steel, the yield and tensile strengths of the formed material were estimated using the Nobre et al [34] incremental relation, which relates the linearity between relative increments of hardness and yield strength. Changes were not noticeable at the microstructural level of the formed samples. Meanwhile, samples from which higher plastic deformation stress values were calculated were not those absorbing higher impact energy when Charpy specimen cut from plate and stretch-bent samples were tested. The maximum relieved residual stress in the parent material was predominantly compressive and represents in magnitude approximately 12 percent (average for the three directions) of its original yield strength. In the stretch-bent samples, the relieved residual stress was compressive in the outer curved section with a magnitude about 50 percent of the parent material yield strength and tensile in the inner curved section with a magnitude approximately 25 percent of the parent material yield strength...|$|E

Complete examination of the subjects was done before and after placement of dental implants. Implant surgery was planned, and osseointegrated dental implants were placed in the subjects. Postoperative evaluation of the dental implant patients was done after 3 weeks. Anxiety levels were determined using State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire on the surgery day and after 1 week of surgery. The participant describes how they feel at the moment by responding to twenty items as follows: (1) absolutely not, (2) slightly, (3) somewhat, or (4) very much. All the results were recorded and statistical analyzed by SPSS software. Results: Out of 51, 29 patients were males while 22 were females, with ratio of 1. 32 : 1. Female patients' mean age was 50. 18 years while male patients' mean age was 52. 71 years, with statistically nonsignificant difference between them. Functional rehabilitation was the main purpose of choosing dental implants in more than 90 % of the subjects.

The combination of vibration and service load can introduce the damage of fretting fatigue on the contact surfaces of the assembly which lead at a nucleation of crack and then the structure fracture.

40|$|We present {{details of}} the design, {{construction}} and testing of a single-beam optical tweezers apparatus capable of measuring and exerting torque, as well as force, on microfabricated, optically anisotropic particles (an ‘optical torque wrench’). The control of angular orientation is achieved by rotating the linear polarization of a trapping laser with an electro-optic modulator (EOM), which affords improved performance over previous designs. The torque imparted to the trapped particle is assessed by measuring the difference between left- and right-circular components of the transmitted light, and constant torque is maintained by feeding this difference signal back into a custom-designed electronic servo loop. The limited angular range of the EOM (± 180 °) is extended by rapidly reversing the polarization once a threshold angle is reached, enabling the <b>torque</b> <b>clamp</b> to function over unlimited, continuous rotations at high bandwidth. In addition, we developed particles suitable for rotation in this apparatus using microfabrication techniques. Altogether, the system allows for the simultaneous application of forces (~ 0. 1 – 100 pN) and torques (~ 1 – 10, 000 pN nm) {{in the study of}} biomolecules.

The ratios of these component torques to total torque were calculated using the data in Table  2 and, respectively, labeled α, β, and γ. Figure  4 shows the relationships of tightening speed with α, β, and γ. Tightening speed had no major effect on α in C. japonica, C. obtusa, and P. menziesii specimens (mean: 17, 25, and 25 %, respectively). We have previously reported that bolted timber joints generally have an α of around 8 – 10 % [4]. However, the value we measured for lag screw joints {{in this study is}} over double that, seeming to signify that lag screws convert <b>clamp</b> force into <b>torque</b> more efficiently than do bolts. In C. japonica, β appear to rise slightly with increasing tightening speed, while no noticeable differences are apparent for γ.

It is critical that the screw joint has the right clamping force to assure that it fulfils its purpose. Large deviations can result in total loss of clamping force and engine breakdown. The purpose with this master thesis was to find the most important factors that affect the clamping force and form the basis of how different screw joints should be handled. Knowledge about Scania screw joints were collected by working in the production, observing drawings, a thorough literature study and by interviewing representatives from different departments. The problems regarding screw joints were found to be rather different at the departments and the problems had been an issue {{for a longer period of}} time. The mapping of screw joints resulted in a number of interesting screw joints with different kinds of problems. A discussion about the interesting screw joints was held in order to select joints to take a closer look at. By focusing on area of interest, area of responsibility and resources, five screw joints were selected, rocker arm shaft, main bearing cap, connecting rod and the oil sump in both aluminum and steel. The chosen screw joints represented specific types of screw joints on which the chosen parameters were tested. The important parameters that were tested are driver speed, friction and settlement. The equipment that was used throughout the work was the Ultrasonic, which measures the length of a screw with ultrasound. The authors feel that the equipment has given reliable results and that it has been easy and convenient to use during the tests since time consuming strain gages were avoided. The test results shows that the speed of the nut runner has a great influence on the <b>clamping</b> force and <b>torque.</b> Depending on the nut runner and which kind of screw joint that is examined the <b>clamping</b> force and <b>torque</b> varies. The friction affects the result of the tightening substantially, especially when tightening by torque. If torque and angle tightening is used it is an advantage to keep the initial torque as low as possible but high enough to keep the surfaces tight together before applying the angle. The test results regarding settlement show that the settlement is extremely dependent on the ingoing parts in the screw joint. Parameters such as screw and clamped parts affect both the tightening procedure and degree of settlement. The authors recommendations are that a decision has to be made about what information is important for each department. Furthermore, as the tightening procedure is really important for the final clamping force it is advisable to decide which department that is responsible of making the correct tightening parameters of a specific screw joint in the production. Hopefully this master thesis has woken an interest which in the future can make a difference for an even more stable production and in the end an even better quality at Scania CV AB.

40|$|Mechanical {{fasteners}} {{remain the}} primary means of load transfer between structural components made of composite laminates. As, in pursuit of increasing efficiency of the structure, the operational load continues to grow, the load carried by each fastener increases accordingly. This accelerates initiation of fatigue-related cracks near the fasteners holes and increases probability of failure. Therefore, {{the assessment of the}} stresses around the fastener holes and the stress intensity factors associated with edge cracks becomes critical for damage-tolerant design. Because of the presence of unknown contact stresses and the contact region between the fastener and the laminate, the analysis of a pin-loaded hole becomes considerably more complex than that of a traction-free hole. The accurate prediction of the contact stress distribution along the hole boundary is critical for determining the stress intensity factors and is essential for reliable strength evaluation and failure prediction. This study concerns the development of an analytical methodology, based on the boundary collocation technique, to determine the contact stresses and stress intensity factors required for strength and life prediction of bolted joints with many fasteners. It provides an analytical capability for determining the non-linear contact stresses in mechanically fastened composite laminates while capturing the effects of finite geometry, presence of edge cracks, interaction among fasteners, material anisotropy, fastener flexibility, fastener-hole clearance, friction between the pin and the laminate, and by-pass loading. Also, the proposed approach permits the determination of the fastener load distribution, which significantly influences the failure load of a multi-fastener joint. The well known phenomenon of the fastener tightening <b>torque</b> (<b>clamping</b> force) influence on the load distribution among the different fastener in a multi-fastener joints is taken into account by means of bi-linear representation of the elastic fastener deflection. Finally, two different failure criteria, maximum strains averaged over the characteristic distances and Tsai-Wu criterion, were used to predict the failure load and failure mode in two composite-aluminum joints. The comparison of the present predictions with the published experimental results reveals their agreement...|$|R
