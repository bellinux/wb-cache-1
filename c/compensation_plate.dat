40|$|This paper reports {{automatic}} {{compensation of}} strong thermal lensing in a suspended 80 m optical cavity with sapphire test mass mirrors. Variation of the transmitted beam spot size {{is used to}} obtain an error signal to control the heating power applied to the cylindrical surface of an intracavity <b>compensation</b> <b>plate.</b> The negative thermal lens created in the <b>compensation</b> <b>plate</b> compensates the positive thermal lens in the sapphire test mass, which {{was caused by the}} absorption of the high intracavity optical power. The results show that feedback control is feasible to compensate the strong thermal lensing expected to occur in advanced laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Compensation allows the cavity resonance to be maintained at the fundamental mode, but the long thermal time constant for thermal lensing control in fused silica could cause difficulties with the control of parametric instabilities.

40|$|In an {{experiment}} {{to simulate the}} conditions in high optical power advanced gravitational wave detectors, we show {{for the first time}} that the time evolution of strong thermal lenses follows the predicted infinite sum of exponentials (approximated by a double exponential), and that such lenses can be compensated using an intracavity <b>compensation</b> <b>plate</b> heated on its cylindrical surface.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{a study of the}} phase camera, which is a {{frequency}} selective wave-front sensor of a laser beam. This sensor is utilized for monitoring sidebands produced by phase modulations in a gravitational wave (GW) detector. Regarding the operation of the GW detectors, the laser modulation/demodulation method is used to measure mirror displacements and used for the position controls. This plays a significant role because the quality of controls affect the noise level of the GW detector. The phase camera is able to monitor each sideband separately, which has a great benefit for the manipulation of the delicate controls. Also, overcoming mirror aberrations will be an essential part of Advanced Virgo (AdV), which is a GW detector close to Pisa. Especially low-frequency sidebands can be affected greatly by aberrations in one of the interferometer cavities. The phase cameras allow tracking such changes because the state of the sidebands gives information on mirror aberrations. A prototype of the phase camera has been developed and is currently tested. The performance checks are almost completed and the installation of the optics at the AdV site has started. After the installation and commissioning, the phase camera will be combined to a thermal compensation system that consists of CO 2 lasers and <b>compensation</b> <b>plates.</b> In this paper, we focus on the prototype and show some limitations from the scanner performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Pretilt angle {{effect on}} the dark-state light leakage and viewing angle of {{in-plane}} switching (IPS) liquid crystal display is investigated. As the liquid crystal (LC) pretilt angle increases, the light leakage becomes more severe and the off-axis light leakage from the out-of-plane LC directors cannot be neglected. Introducing an oblique <b>compensation</b> <b>plate</b> (O-plate) reduces the off-axis light leakages from the crossed linear polarizers and the anisotropic LC media simultaneously which, in turn, improves the viewing angle of the IPS LCD. Index Terms—Compensation plate, in-plane switching (IPS), light leakage, liquid crystal display (LCD), wide viewing angle. I...|$|E

40|$|The Mohorovičič {{discontinuity}} (Moho), {{which is}} the surface separating the Earth’s crust from the mantle, is of great interest among geoscientists. The Moho depth can be determined by seismic and gravimetric methods. The seismic methods are expensive, time-consuming and suffer from lack of global coverage of data, while the gravimetric methods use inexpensive and mostly already available global and regional data based on an isostatic model. The main reasons for studying an isostatic model are on one hand the gaps and uncertainties of the seismic models, and, on the other hand, the generous availability of gravity data from global models for the gravimetric-isostatic model. In this study, we present a new gravimetric-isostatic Moho model, called the Vening Meinesz-Moritz (VMM) model. Also, a combined Moho model based on seismic and gravimetric models is presented. Classical isostatic hypotheses assume that the topographic potential is fully compensated at all wavelengths, while {{is not the case}} in reality. We found that the maximum degree of compensation for the topographic potential based on the new Moho model is 60, corresponding to the resolution of about 330 km. Other (dynamic) isostatic effects (such as temporal <b>compensation,</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics, post-glacial rebound, etc) should be considered as well, which are disregarded in this thesis. Numerical results imply that the dynamic phenomena affect mostly the long-wavelengths. The VMM model is applied for different purposes. The Moho density contrast is an important parameter for estimating the Moho depth, and we present a technique to simultaneously estimate Moho depth and density contrast by the VMM and seismic models. Another application is the recovery of gravity anomaly from Satellite Gravity Gradiometry (SGG) data by a smoothing technique, and we show that the VMM model performs better than the Airy-Heiskanen isostatic model. We achieved an rms difference of 4 mGal for the gravity anomaly estimated from simulated GOCE data in comparison with EGM 08, and this result is better than direct downward continuation of the data without smoothing. We also present a direct method to recover Moho depth from the SGG mission, and we show that the recovered Moho is more or less of the same quality as that obtained from terrestrial gravimetric data (with an rms error of 2 km). Moreover, a strategy is developed for creating substitutes for missing GOCE data in Antarctica, where there is a polar gap of such data. The VMM model is further used for constructing a Synthetic Earth Gravity Model (SEGM). The topographic-isostatic potential is simple to apply for the SEGM, and the latter can be an excellent tool to fill data gaps, extending the EGMs to higher degrees and validating a recovery technique of the gravity field from a satellite mission. Regional and global tests of the SEGM yield a relative error of less than 3 % vs. EGM 08 to degree 2160.  QC 2011040...|$|E
40|$|Gravity {{derived from}} Seasat {{altimetry}} {{has provided a}} means of estimating seafloor topography and its compensation, which in turn {{can be used to}} understand the evolution of oceanic lithosphere. In the first study, the correlation between the geoid, deflection of the vertical, and seafloor topography is investigated along a section of the Southwest Indian Ridge. Geoid anomalies computed from a simple thermal model fairly accurately predict the intermediate-wavelength anomalies across the fracture zones. The shorter wavelength anomalies are consistent with those calculated from topography using elastic <b>plate</b> <b>compensation.</b> The combined effect of the thermal offset and seafloor topography produces an anomaly which has a small-amplitude, short-wavelength depression directly over the fracture zone valley. Pronounced lineations in the horizontal geoid gradient do not coincide with the valley but have trends parallel to the fracture zones. In the second study, fracture zones along the Southwest Indian Ridge are identified using altimeter profiles and bathymetry. Finite poles of rotation are determined from the fracture zone locations and magnetic anomaly lineations for anomalies 6 (20 Ma), 13 (37 Ma), and 20 (45 Ma). The new poles are in general agreement with previously published poles and describe a fairly consistent direction of relative motion between Africa and Antarctica for the past 45 Myr. A present-day pole of rotation calculated from transform fault azimuths determined primarily from their geoid anomalies, agrees with published poles based on bathymetric data. In the third study, the rate of change of the geoid with age has been estimated as a function of age from geoid offsets across the Eltanin and Udintsev fracture zones and used to constrain thermal models of lithospheric cooling. Observed trends in the geoid slope versus age plots are similar on both branches of the Eltanin and the east limb of the Udintsev fracture zone. The similarity in trends argues against the effects of isolated thermal or bathymetric anomalies and appears instead to reflect a general feature of the geoid-slope versus average age relationship across fracture zones. Although the thermal plate cooling model is successful in predicting both seafloor depths and heat flow values out to ages of at least 80 m. y. B. P., it cannot explain the observed geoid slope values for these two fracture zones. It is not clear at this point whether this is due to inadequacies in the cooling model or to peculiarities in fracture zone evolution. by Mavis Lynn Driscoll. Thesis (Ph. D.)
