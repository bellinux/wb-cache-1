Wordsworth conceived that fixing {{the duration of the}} period of revision was of great consequence, both as obviating all agitation in the way of call for such a process, and as tending in the matter of critical discussions respecting the sanctioning, cancelling, and proposing of amendments to bring them to something of definitiveness in preparation for each era of revision.|$|E
6000|$|His {{correspondence}} with Atterbury, {{and several other}} letters, were printed {{for the first time}} in the avowed edition of Pope. He omitted as well as added, and left out some of the letters to and from Wycherley, some of the letters to and from Cromwell, some of the letters to ladies, and a few scattered letters from the remaining groups. In the letters he republished he here and there erased a sentence which had appeared in the volume of 1735, or inserted a sentence which was new. The minuter verbal alterations are numerous, but many of them are only <b>corrections</b> <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> of the press. In all essential particulars the collection of P. T., a little more sifted, is reproduced in the quarto of 1737. Pope had profited in the interval by the criticisms of the public. He set aside the portions of his correspondence which were condemned, he endeavoured to rectify the inconsistencies into which he had been betrayed in its reconstruction, and he sometimes altered a word or a phrase in the final revision to which he subjected the work. The changes leave it apparent that the Pope text and the P. T. text are identical in their origin, and neither of them are the text of the actual letters of the poet. His selection affords an imperfect test of the parts which he disowned as being counterfeited. He said in his advertisement of July 15, 1735, that he would reprint whatever was genuine in the surreptitious editions; but he relinquished this design, and wrote to Allen that [...] "he was determined to leave out every syllable that could give the least ill example to an age apt to take it, or the least offence to any good or serious man."[110] He accordingly stated in his preface that he had not only omitted the letters which [...] "were not his," [...] but those which [...] "were not approved of by him." [...] Without committing himself to an assertion which might be refuted, he probably wished to obtain the benefit of the first alternative for letters which he had rejected under the last. Nevertheless in his eagerness to particularise any real forgery, he in effect accredited the entire collection of P. T. He had far greater interest in showing that it was not authentic than in damaging the trumpery volumes of Curll, and his forbearance to select a single instance of imposition from its pages is a plain proof that none existed for which he himself was not responsible. The charge of interpolation, which he had twice put forth in his advertisements,[111] and subsequently repeated to Allen,[112] was still more openly abandoned; for he tells us in his preface that the passages he omitted were [...] "improper, or at least impertinent to be divulged to the public," [...] and he no longer pretended that they were any of them spurious. He did not, in short, disown in his genuine edition one sentence of the volume of 1735, but practically receded from his previous allegations, which were mis-statements intended to persuade Caryll that he was not answerable for the garbling of the letters, and the world that he was not a party to their publication.|$|E

Methods: In this retrospective study, records of all patients who underwent automated perimetry during June to July 2008 were reviewed. We compared {{the records of}} the patients who underwent automated perimetry without any refractive error correction or only partial <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> refractive <b>errors</b> (Group 1) with those having full <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> refractive <b>errors</b> (Group 2) during visual field testing. We analyzed whether full <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> the refractive <b>errors</b> during visual field testing improved the reliability indices (false-positive errors, false-negative errors, and fixation losses) of the visual fields. Results: There was improvement in reliability indices after full <b>correction</b> <b>of</b> refractive <b>errors,</b> but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0. 3). Males showed better reliability than females (p = 0. 07). Subjects aged 60 years or younger had more reliable fields (p = 0. 02).
