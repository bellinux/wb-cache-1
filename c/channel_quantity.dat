However, when {{the extension of the}} theorem is made to the baryon resonance sector (multi-channel situation in the inelastic region above first inelastic threshold), eigenphases (diagonal multi-channel quantities) replace phase shifts (single <b>channel</b> <b>quantities).</b> It is necessary to stress that the renowned pi/ 2 resonance criterion is formulated for eigenphases and not for phase shifts, so the resonance extracting procedure has to be applied with utmost care. The potential instability of extracting eigenphases from experimental data which occurs if insufficient number of channels is used can be reduced if a trace function which explicitly takes multi-channel aspect of the problem into account is used instead of single-channel phase shifts.

40|$|In {{this article}} a theory is {{presented}} to calculate integral properties of biological ion channels (like currentvoltage and conductance-concentration relations). The qualitative form of these relations predicted by the theory agrees well with data measured in experiments. For instance, the saturation of the channel conductance with increasing external ion concentration is predicted for a class of ion channels (as, for instance, found for the gramicidin A, acetylcholine receptors, NMDA, and sarcoplasmic reticulum channels). In contrast to commonly used approaches such as the Eyring rate theory, this method {{is directly related to}} physical parameters of the ion channel such as the channel length and diameter, dielectric constant, ionic mobility, and minimal ionic concentration inside the channel. The theory starts from Nernst-Planck and Poisson equations. Using the method of phase trajectory (as proposed by Schottky) and the regional approximation, rather general expressions can be derived for integral <b>channel</b> <b>quantities</b> in the drift limit (|Vl > kBT/eo) in the presence of multiple ionic species. The theory predicts two typical types of conductance-concentration relations found experimentally: a monotone saturating conductance and a maximum in the conductance. The realized type of relation depends on the minimal ionic concentration inside the channel. In the present form the theory is restricted to narrow ion channels where the length exceeds its diameter. The ions are assumed to behave like structureless point charges at not too high ionic concentration...|$|R

The problem is analyzed as a Stackelberg game in which the vendor acts as the leader and buyers act as followers. A simple strategy is developed for the vendor to employ a uniform quantity-discount policy to coordinate buyers' replenishment times by the power-of-two policy. Solution procedures are developed for the equilibrium strategy. It is shown that time coordination generally has a substantial benefit for the vendor, although the benefit to the buyers may be limited. Furthermore, uniform quantity discounts to all buyers are normally feasible but not sufficient to achieve perfect channel coordination when buyers act independently. The proposed strategy obtains a high proportion of the maximum benefit under perfect <b>channel</b> coordination. <b>Quantity</b> Discounts, <b>Channel</b> Coordination, Supply Chain Management...|$|R
