Light propagating through a <b>fiber</b> optic <b>cable</b> gradually attenuates due to Rayleigh scattering.

Since the backscattered light attenuates exponentially as it travels along the optical <b>fiber</b> <b>cable,</b> the <b>attenuation</b> characteristic is represented in a logarithmic scale graph. If {{the slope of the}} graph is steep, then power loss is high. If the slope is gentle, then optical fiber has a satisfactory loss characteristic.|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the extension of}} the measurement range of Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) sensors using a distributed Brillouin amplifier (DBA). The technique is based on injecting a DBA pump wave in the fiber to generate an additional Brillouin interaction that amplifies the BOTDA pump pulses and compensates optical <b>fiber</b> <b>attenuation.</b> This amplification does not introduce any significant noise to the BOTDAâ€™s probe wave due to the inherent directionality of the Brillouin gain. Additionally, we deploy a differential pulse-width pair measurement method to avoid measurement errors due to the interplay between the self-phase modulation effect and the changes in the temporal shape of the pulses induced by the transient behavior of Brillouin gain. Experimental proof-of-concept results in a 50 -km fiber link demonstrate full compensa- tion of the <b>fiberâ€™s</b> <b>attenuation</b> with no penalty on the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected signal.

A modified melt spinning apparatus with high-speed air nozzle was designed and fabricated to produce continuous polypropylene filaments by cold air drawing only. With this setup, the fiber is quenched and simultaneously attenuated by a symmetric cold air jet. Since the formation of fiber structure is highly dependent on the processing conditions, the new process will provide a unique operation window to study <b>fiber</b> <b>attenuation</b> and structural formation under high-speed cold air drawing. Based on computational fluid dynamics simulation results, a parametric study was carried out under different process conditions which include processing temperature, air velocity and polymer volume flow rate. Effects of changes in processing variables on the fiber diameter, molecular orientation, crystallinity, tensile strength and other properties were studied.

40|$|The {{radiation}} sensitivity of chiral long period gratings was investigated {{for the first}} time. After a Co- 60 gamma dose of 100 kGy they show radiation-induced changes of their transmission dip wavelength of up to 10 nm, which is 100 to 1000 {{times higher than the}} radiation-induced wavelength shift of different fiber Bragg grating types. They can therefore be used as radiation sensors down to doses of 10 Gy or even below, but not for accurate dose measurements since the size of the wavelength shift after a certain dose still depends on the radiation dose rate. Chiral gratings made of eight single mode fiber types with differences of their radiation-induced attenuation of several orders of magnitude were investigated in order to look for a correlation between dip wavelength shift and <b>fiber</b> <b>attenuation.</b> However, the dip wavelength curves do not show exactly the same order as the <b>fiber</b> <b>attenuation</b> curves.
