5|$|In November 2012, {{shortly after}} {{entering}} office, Rivers {{was appointed to}} the Republican leadership as the minority whip. When the Majority Coalition Caucus was formed, taking <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> away from the Democrats, Rivers was promoted to majority whip. It is rare for a freshman senator to be appointed to party leadership.|$|E
5|$|Specter was {{chairman}} of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence from 1995, when the Republicans gained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> until 1997, when he became chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. He chaired that committee until 2001 and again from 2003 to 2005, during the times the Republicans controlled the Senate. He also chaired the Judiciary Committee from 2005 to 2007.|$|E
5|$|When the Republican Party regained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1996, Glenn was {{the ranking}} {{minority}} member on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (chaired by Maine senator Susan Collins) which investigated illegal foreign donations by China to U.S.political campaigns for the 1996 election. Considerable acrimony existed between Glenn and committee chair Fred Thompson of Tennessee.|$|E
50|$|As {{lieutenant}} governor and presiding officer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state <b>Senate</b> in 1949, McKiernan cast the tie-breaking vote {{that resulted in}} <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> new rules effectively giving Democrats <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate’s</b> legislative committees {{for the first time}} in more than a decade. He was re-elected to a third term as {{lieutenant governor}} in November 1950.|$|R

5000|$|In September 2001, Democrats won {{a lottery}} to redraw {{legislative}} districts {{that had been}} drawn ten years earlier by Republicans and had helped ensure ten uninterrupted years <b>of</b> Republican <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Illinois <b>Senate.</b> At <b>the</b> November 2002 election, the Democratic remap helped them win <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Illinois <b>Senate</b> and expand their majority in the Illinois House {{to work with the}} first Democratic Illinois governor in 26 years.|$|R
5|$|Despite the state's general Republican and {{conservative}} leanings, Democrats have found success in various statewide elections, {{most notably in}} those involving South Dakota's congressional representatives in Washington. American Indians have been becoming more active in state and county electoral politics. In the 2002 election, American Indian voting carried Tim Johnson as the Democratic candidate {{by a margin of}} 532 votes. Until his electoral defeat in 2004, Senator Tom Daschle was the Senate minority leader (and briefly its majority leader during Democratic <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 2001–02).|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Clements was {{appointed}} Democratic party whip, serving under party leader Lyndon B. Johnson. In addition, he retained his {{chairmanship of the}} Senate Democratic Reelection Committee for the 1954 election cycle. He and Democratic National Committee chair Stephen Mitchell agreed that the two committees should conduct separate fund-raising operations {{in order to maximize}} donations for Democratic candidates. Democrats regained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1954, and Clements instituted the practice of having his committee provide transition services for freshman senators. That practice continues today.|$|E
5|$|Nixon's agenda {{had been}} impeded {{by the fact}} that Congress was {{controlled}} by Democrats and he hoped to take <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in the 1970 midterm elections. Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon and his aides initially planned to restrict Agnew's role to fundraising and the giving of a standard stump speech that would avoid personal attacks. The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters on social issues would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not to do any active campaigning, but to remain above the fray and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority.|$|E

5|$|After Republicans gained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1981, Mathias {{sought the}} {{chairmanship}} of the Judiciary Committee but was relegated to the relatively mundane chairmanship of the Rules Committee. He was also appointed chairman of the Government Operations Subcommittee on Government Efficiency and the District of Columbia, and accepted a seat on the influential Foreign Relations Committee, though he had to sacrifice his seat on the Appropriations Committee to do so. In 1982, Mathias chaired a bipartisan Senate inquiry into the methods used by the FBI in the Abscam corruption investigation, which found that dozens of officials had been named for accepting bribes without basis. He also served as co-chair of the Joint Committee on Printing from 1981 to 1983 and 1985 to 1987, and {{as a member of the}} Joint Committee on the Library from 1983 to 1987.|$|E
5|$|George B. Martin, who {{had served}} six months in the Senate in 1918 after being {{appointed}} to fill a vacancy, opposed Barkley in the 1932 primary, but Barkley defeated him by a two-to-one margin. In the general election, he defeated Republican Congressman Maurice H. Thatcher {{by a vote of}} 575,077 to 393,865, marking {{the first time in the}} 20th century that a Kentucky senator won a second consecutive term. Democrats gained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> during the 1932 elections; Joseph Robinson was chosen majority leader, and he appointed Barkley as his assistant. Together, they secured passage of New Deal legislation, including the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act, and the Federal Emergency Relief Act. In July 1934, the Democratic National Committee chose Barkley to respond to Republican National Committee chairman Henry P. Fletcher's radio attacks on the New Deal. Later that year, he embarked on a tour of twenty states, defending the New Deal and stumping for Democratic candidates in the 1934 midterm elections.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges. The law caused {{a significant reduction in}} the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance. Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 2014.|$|E

50|$|Following <b>the</b> 1964 defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party and Barry Goldwater, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maine <b>Senate</b> went to <b>the</b> Democratic Party for {{the first}} time since 1911. Reed was elected President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maine <b>Senate.</b> Two years later, the Republican Party regained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maine <b>Senate</b> and Reed and his fellow Democrats were relegated to opposition. In 1966, Reed sought the Democratic {{nomination}} for governor, losing to Kenneth M. Curtis. Following re-election to his 4th term in 1968, Reed was elected Minority Leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maine <b>Senate.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Iowa Republican Party made large {{gains in}} the election, {{increasing}} its majority in the State House and taking <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State <b>Senate,</b> giving <b>the</b> state a Republican trifecta {{for the first time}} since 1996.|$|R
5|$|Senate {{committees}} can {{be affected}} by the party composition of the Senate. The Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, argued that a government majority of seats in the Senate resulted in limitations on what the committees inquired into, and how readily governments responded to their queries and requests for information. Statistics published by centrist political party the Australian Democrats have been used to support the contention that committee operations have been inhibited by government <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> particularly in respect of selection of topics for committee inquiry. However Senator Minchin, the leader of the government in the Senate in the mid-2000s, pointed out that their political rivals had previously cut off debate on more bills in the Senate than had his government.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} next {{considered}} in the Senate, where it faced stronger opposition from key Democrats led by Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland, who insisted on more protection for their states' industries than the Wilson bill allowed. The bill passed the Senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms. The Sugar Trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it {{at the expense of}} the consumer. Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> by trusts and business interests. Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam's Labor {{government}} {{had been elected}} in 1972 with a small majority in the House of Representatives, but with the Opposition controlling the Senate. Another election in 1974 resulted in little change. While the Whitlam Government introduced many new policies and programs, it was also rocked by scandals and political miscalculations. In October 1975, the Opposition used its <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> to defer passage of appropriation bills, which finance governmental operations and which had been passed by the House of Representatives. The Opposition stated that they would {{continue to do so}} unless Whitlam called an election for the House of Representatives and urged Kerr to dismiss Whitlam unless he agreed to their demand. Whitlam believed that Kerr would not dismiss him, and Kerr did nothing to disabuse Whitlam of this notion.|$|E
50|$|In the November 2014 general election, <b>the</b> Democrats lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maine <b>Senate</b> but {{retained}} a narrow majority in <b>the</b> Maine House <b>of</b> Representatives. A week later, Eves was re-nominated as House Speaker by his caucus.|$|R
50|$|By winning {{two more}} {{seats in the}} 2008 elections, <b>the</b> Republicans assumed <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oklahoma <b>Senate</b> for <b>the</b> first time in state history and held a 26-22 majority, thus ending the power sharing {{arrangement}} between the parties.|$|R
50|$|The party {{suffered}} {{another major}} electoral {{defeat in the}} 2011 cantonal elections held on 20 and 27 March 2011, and in September, <b>the</b> centre-right lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French <b>Senate</b> for <b>the</b> first time in <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fifth Republic.|$|R
5|$|In the 1918 midterm congressional elections, held {{just before}} the armistice, Republicans {{narrowly}} took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Harding {{was appointed to the}} Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Wilson took no senators with him to the Paris Peace Conference, confident that he could force what became the Treaty of Versailles through the Senate by appealing to the people. When he returned with a single treaty establishing both peace and a League of Nations, the country was overwhelmingly on his side. Many senators disliked Article X of the League Covenant, that committed signatories to the defense of any member nation that was attacked, seeing it as forcing the United States to war without the assent of Congress. Harding was one of 39 senators who signed a round-robin letter opposing the League. When Wilson invited the Foreign Relations Committee to the White House to informally discuss the treaty, Harding ably questioned Wilson about Article X; the president evaded his inquiries. The Senate debated Versailles in September 1919, and Harding made a major speech against it. By then, Wilson had suffered a stroke while on a speaking tour. With an incapacitated President in the White House and less support in the country, the treaty was defeated.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 {{election}} saw the Republicans capture {{not just}} the presidency but <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> as well, and Kennedy was in the minority party {{for the first time}} in his career. Kennedy did not dwell upon his presidential loss, but instead reaffirmed his public commitment to American liberalism. He chose to become the ranking member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee rather than of the Judiciary Committee, which he would later say was one of the most important decisions of his career. Kennedy became a committed champion of women's issues and of gay rights, and established relationships with select Republican senators to block Reagan's actions and preserve and improve the Voting Rights Act, funding for AIDS treatment, and equal funding for women's sports under Title IX. To combat being in the minority, he worked long hours and devised a series of hearings-like public forums to which he could invite experts and discuss topics important to him. Kennedy could not hope to stop all of Reagan's reshapings of government, but was often nearly the sole effective Democrat battling him.|$|E
5|$|When Tillman {{entered the}} Senate in 1895, he {{was opposed to}} {{expansion}} of the United States Navy, fearing the expenditure would cause the issuance of bonds by the president, which he felt would only enrich the wealthy. Tillman sat on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and soon {{came to understand that}} South Carolina could benefit from naval appropriations steered towards her. A flow of federal funds to his home state resulted, beginning in 1900, followed by the establishment, in 1909, of the Charleston Naval Shipyard. Once Democrats took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> {{for the first time in}} Tillman's tenure, in 1913, he became chairman of the committee and allied with others from the southeast (such as Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, a North Carolinian) to see that the bulk of naval appropriations would be spent there. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims (57th through 59th Congresses) and on the Committee on Five Civilized Tribes of Indians (61st and 62nd Congresses). Strokes in 1908 and 1910 decreased his influence and ability in the Senate; his seniority entitled him to become Senate Appropriations Committee chairman in 1913, but his health did not permit it.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> 2010 Missouri <b>Senate</b> {{elections}} were held on November 2, 2010. Voters in the 12 even-numbered districts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Missouri <b>Senate</b> voted for their representatives. Other {{elections were}} also held on November 2. The Missouri Republican Party gained three seats and maintained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Missouri <b>Senate.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 2008 {{elections}} {{marked the}} first time in State history that the Republican Party won <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oklahoma <b>Senate</b> and <b>the</b> first time they retained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oklahoma House <b>of</b> Representatives, thereby creating the first Republican control Oklahoma Legislature in State history.|$|R
50|$|Four {{state senate}} recall {{elections}} took place {{the same day}} as the gubernatorial recall elections, resulting in two wins by Republican incumbents, one open seat win by a Republican, and one win by a Democratic challenger, giving Democrats <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state <b>Senate.</b>|$|R
5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E
25|$|During the 1998 and 2000 {{election}} cycles, McConnell {{was chairman}} of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Republicans maintained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> after both elections. He was first elected as Majority Whip in the 108th Congress and unanimously re-elected on November 17, 2004. Senator Bill Frist, the Majority Leader, did not seek re-election in the 2006 elections. In November 2006, after Republicans lost <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> they elected McConnell to replace Frist as Minority Leader. After Republicans took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> following the 2014 Senate elections, McConnell became the Senate Majority Leader.|$|E
25|$|When <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> {{switched}} from Republicans to Democrats in June 2001, Lieberman became Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, with oversight responsibilities {{for a broad}} range of government activities. When Republicans gained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in January 2003, Lieberman resumed his role as ranking minority member of the committees he had once chaired.|$|E
5000|$|Republicans {{also made}} {{historic}} gains in state legislatures, adding more than 675 state legislative seats, by far surpassing their state-legislative gains in 1994. Republicans gained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> dozens of state legislative chambers, and took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> [...] "seven more legislatures outright {{than they did}} after 1994 and the most since 1952." [...] Republicans picked up <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alabama Legislature {{for the first time}} since Reconstruction; <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Carolina <b>Senate</b> for <b>the</b> first time since 1870; and <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Minnesota <b>Senate</b> for <b>the</b> first time since the state returned to partisan elections in 1974.|$|R

50|$|Socialist <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French <b>Senate</b> {{would prevent}} Sarkozy from passing a {{balanced}} budget constitutional amendment, which requires three-fifths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vote from the combined French Parliament.
