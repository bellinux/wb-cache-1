5|$|To wear tefillin without {{reciting the}} blessings: This is the opinion of, among others, Jacob ben Asher, Moses of Coucy and David HaLevi Segal.

5|$|To sum up: The {{lines of}} {{cleavage}} between Pablo's revisionism and orthodox Trotskyism are {{so deep that}} no <b>compromise</b> <b>is</b> possible either politically or organizationally. The Pablo faction has demonstrated {{that it will not}} permit democratic decisions truly reflecting majority opinion to be reached. They demand complete submission to their criminal policy. They are determined to drive all orthodox Trotskyists out of the Fourth International or to muzzle and handcuff them.|$|E
5|$|Companies {{object to}} being blamed for shark bite incidents, {{pointing}} out that lightning tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans. Their position is that further {{research needs to be}} done before banning practices such as chumming, which may alter natural behavior. One <b>compromise</b> <b>is</b> to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway, well away from human leisure areas. Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these responsible tourism.|$|E

5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the <b>compromise</b> <b>is</b> a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{battlefield}} is now preserved in Princeton Battlefield State Park, which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Another section of {{the battlefield}} adjacent to the state park is embroiled in a development controversy. The Institute for Advanced Study, which owns the property, is planning a housing project on land where George Washington charged with his men during the battle. Historians, the Department of the Interior and archaeological evidence confirm the land's significance. Several national and local preservation organizations are working to prevent construction on the property, and the Princeton Battlefield Society had legal action pending as of summer 2016. On December 12, 2016, the Civil War Trust announced they will purchase almost 15 acres of land from the Institute for Advanced Study. Seven of the planned single family dwellings will be replaced with townhouses. In total, 16 housing units will be constructed. The <b>compromise</b> <b>is</b> subject to approval by the Princeton Planning Board and Delaware and Raritan Canal Commission.|$|E
5|$|Tyrion {{discovers that}} the Sons of the Harpy are {{funded by the}} slavers of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, and {{arranges}} a meeting with representatives of those cities to give them seven years to abolish slavery. Despite Tyrion's insistence that <b>compromise</b> <b>is</b> necessary, this solution is met with disapproval by Daenerys' other advisors and the freedmen of Meereen. Tyrion also enlists {{the assistance of the}} red priestess Kinvara, who believes that Daenerys is a messianic figure prophesied by her faith and offers the support of the followers of R'hllor. Meereen begins to prosper, but the city's success attracts the ire of the slavers, who fear it will undermine the legitimacy of slavery, and so launch a massive naval attack against the city. Daenerys returns in the chaos, and though she is displeased with Tyrion's failure, she is persuaded by him to obliterate the slavers' fleet and force their ultimate surrender rather than destroy them outright. Soon after, Theon and Yara Greyjoy arrive in Meereen offering Daenerys the Iron Fleet; they are joined by the fleets of Dorne and the Reach, who have defected from the Lannisters. Daenerys names an honored Tyrion as her Hand of the Queen. Tyrion then joins her, the dragons, and her army as they sail to Westeros.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent study}} found that lying takes longer than telling the truth, and thus the time to answer a {{question}} may be used as a method of lie detection.

25|$|Congress has alternated between {{periods of}} {{constructive}} cooperation and compromise between parties known as bipartisanship and periods of deep political polarization and fierce infighting known as partisanship. The period after the Civil War {{was marked by}} partisanship {{as is the case}} today. It is generally easier for committees to reach accord on issues when <b>compromise</b> <b>is</b> possible. Some political scientists speculate that a prolonged period marked by narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress has intensified partisanship in the last few decades but that an alternation of control of Congress between Democrats and Republicans may lead to greater flexibility in policies as well as pragmatism and civility within the institution.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcast}} or {{transport channel}} for TV {{in countries that}} use NTSC or ATSC has a bandwidth of 6MHz. To conserve bandwidth, SSB would be desirable, but the video signal has significant low-frequency content (average brightness) and has rectangular synchronising pulses. The engineering <b>compromise</b> <b>is</b> vestigial-sideband transmission. In vestigial sideband, the full upper sideband of bandwidth W2 = 4.75MHz is transmitted, but only W1 = 1.25MHz of the lower sideband is transmitted, along with a carrier. This effectively makes the system AM at low modulation frequencies and SSB at high modulation frequencies. The absence of the lower sideband components at high frequencies must be compensated for, and this {{is done by the}} RF and IF filters.|$|E
50|$|Regulating abortion, in {{combination}} with §218a. Revised several times, with an early 1970s liberalization declared unconstitutional by the courts, and historically very controversial. After a multi-partisan <b>compromise</b> <b>was</b> reached during the early 1990s, it permits abortion during the first trimester, upon condition of mandatory counseling and a waiting period, and in rare exceptional cases afterwards. After this <b>compromise</b> <b>was</b> found, there has been relatively little further controversy about the section.|$|R

25|$|Tyre {{selection}} is critical, usually {{done by the}} individual rider based on bike 'feel' during practice, qualifying and the pre-race warm-up laps {{on the morning of}} the race, as well as the predicted weather. The typical <b>compromise</b> <b>is</b> between grip and longevity—softer compound tyres have more traction, but wear out more quickly; harder compound tyres have less traction, but are more likely to last the entire race. Conserving rubber throughout a race is a specific skill winning riders acquire. Special 'Q' or qualifying tyres of extreme softness and grip were typically used during grid-qualifying sessions until their use was discontinued at the end of the 2008 season, but they lasted typically no longer than one or two laps, though they could deliver higher qualifying speeds. In wet conditions, special tires ('wets') with full treads are used, but they suffer extreme wear if the track dries out.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} views on optimal timing of surgery after a spinal cord injury. The general consensus is {{to operate the}} patient {{when he or she}} is neurologically stable. Some surgeons try to operate a patient as early as possible. The advantages of this are that the patient {{can take advantage of the}} new functional possibilities before new adjustments and apaptations develop. Other surgeons operate when it becomes feasible. This is usually 12–18 months after injury (can be shortened to 6–7 months) and only after stabilization of motor function. Important spasticity (see further) and neurovegetative complications (i.e. bladder function, bowel function, pulmonary function and pressure sores) must have been treated already. The patient must be able to sit in a wheelchair so that he/she can move the arm against gravity. Usually a <b>compromise</b> <b>is</b> found between the patient’s wishes and the surgeon when timing the surgery.|$|E

Two weeks later the <b>compromise</b> <b>was</b> rejected by FB. A new <b>compromise</b> <b>was</b> announced on 29 June 2004, whereby FB would give 50 million Norwegian krone (NOK) and a lot free to Stabæk in exchange for the commercial properties which would be part of the stadium.

500|$|Corzine's {{shutdown}} {{of state government}} had some effect on New Jersey and national politics. According to Clay F. Richards, assistant director of a poll by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, Corzine had a 44% approval rating, his highest since January 2006. The poll also indicated that 71% of respondents disapproved of the legislature's handling of its job. According to Richards, [...] "New Jersey voters clearly blame the state legislature for the budget crisis, and say the property-tax relief that the legislature insisted on in the <b>compromise</b> <b>is</b> more politics than real reform." [...] Of those polled, 23% {{indicated that they would}} not vote for those representatives who voted for the sales-tax hike in the future. The legislature's next election was in November 2007, but Corzine did not face re-election until 2009.|$|E
500|$|Ideology {{was a key}} {{component}} of Soviet foreign policy. Soviet diplomacy was built on the ideas of Marxism-Leninism; Vladimir Lenin understood that <b>compromise</b> <b>is</b> an important element in foreign diplomacy and was a proponent of peaceful coexistence with the capitalist powers. A primary goal of the emphasis placed on coexistence and compromise was to “prevent the imperialist states from attacking the USSR while it was restoring the Russian economy following the Civil War and, later, while it was undertaking industrial development. Therefore, [...] "certain agreements with the imperialist countries in the interest of socialism" [...] could sometimes be reached. The relationship between policy and ideology remained an active issue until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. According to an unknown former director of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, all successful diplomatic activities by the Soviet side were based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the Soviet evaluation of other countries in certain fields, such as social development. The Directorate for Planning Foreign Policy Measures, an organ of the MER, analysed international relations and tried to predict future events, although it never actually planned the policy of the MER. Soviet foreign affairs minister Eduard Shevardnadze claimed that Soviet foreign policy, and the [...] "new thinking" [...] approach laid out by Gorbachev, had become the cornerstone of maintaining stable diplomatic relations throughout the world.|$|E

500|$|In April 2006, Edward Jones and the ACLU {{sued the}} City of Los Angeles, {{on behalf of}} Robert Lee Purrie and five other {{homeless}} people, for the city's violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and Article I, sections 7 and 17 of the California Constitution (supporting due process and equal protection, and prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment). The Court {{ruled in favor of}} the ACLU, stating that, [...] "the LAPD cannot arrest people for sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks in Skid Row." [...] Enforcement of section 41.18(d) 24 hours a day against persons who have nowhere else to sit, lie, or sleep, other than on public streets and sidewalks, is breaking these amendments. The Court said that the anti-camping ordinance is [...] "one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States". Jones and the ACLU wanted a compromise in which the LAPD is barred from enforcing section 41.18(d) (arrest, seizure, and imprisonment) in Skid Row between the hours of 9:00p.m. and 6:30am. The compromise plan permits the homeless to sleep on the sidewalk, provided they are not [...] "within 10 feet of any business or residential entrance" [...] and only between these hours. One of the motivations for the <b>compromise</b> <b>is</b> the shortage of space in the prison system. Downtown development business interests and the Central City Association (CCA) were against the compromise. Police Chief William Bratton said the case had slowed the police effort to fight crime and clean up Skid Row, and that when he was allowed to clean up Skid Row, real estate profited. On September 20, 2006, the Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise. On October 3, 2006, police arrested Skid Row's transients for sleeping on the streets {{for the first time in}} months.|$|E
