40|$|Critical metals are {{fundamental}} to many 21 st century processes and technologies. These elements {{are essential for}} maintaining and improving future quality of life, including many high-technology yet low-carbon industries. Two factors {{have been used by}} the NRC (National Research Council) to rank criticality: {{the degree to which a}} commodity is essential and the risk of supply disruption for the commodity (Verplanch and Hitzman, 2016). The European Union has identified twenty critical raw materials as critical metals (Ec, 2015). Many of these critical materials (including Rare Earth Elements (REEs), Platinum Group Elements (PGEs), Magnesium, Niobium, Germanium, Indium, Gallium, <b>Cobalt,</b> <b>Borate,</b> Tungsten, Fluorspar are important for high-technology, environmental protection and military applications, but vulnerable to politically or economically driven fluctuations in supply (Pirajno, 2009; Laznicka, 2010; Charalampides et al., 2015; Fernandez, 2017). Tin, Molybdenum and Lithium) are included as critical metals by several countries (e. g. Australia; Skirrow et al., 2013). Of course a number of other metals, which have not been assessed as critical, are also of significant importance for modern technologies – these include some of the alloy metals such as chromium, nickel and molybdenum...|$|E
40|$|The atomic layer {{deposition}} (ALD) {{of films}} with the approximate compositions Mn 3 (BO 3) 2 and CoB 2 O 4 is described using MnTp 2 or CoTp 2 [Tp ¼ tris(pyrazolyl) borate] with ozone. The solid state decomposition temperatures of MnTp 2 and CoTp 2 are 370 and 340 C, respectively. Preparative-scale sublimations of MnTp 2 and CoTp 2 at 210 C/ 0. 05 Torr afforded > 99 % recoveries with < 0. 1 % nonvolatile residues. Self-limited ALD growth was demonstrated at 325 C for MnTp 2 or CoTp 2 with ozone as the coreactant. The growth rate for the manganese borate process was 0. 19 A˚ /cycle within the ALD window of 300 – 350 C. The growth rate for the <b>cobalt</b> <b>borate</b> process was 0. 39 – 0. 42 A˚ /cycle at 325 C. X-ray diffraction of the as-deposited films {{indicated that they were}} amorphous. Atomic force microscopy of 35 – 36 nm thick manganese borate films grown within the 300 – 350 C ALD window showed root mean square surface roughnesses of 0. 4 – 0. 6 nm. Film stoichiometries were assessed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and time of flight-elastic recoil detection analysis. The differing film stoichiometries obtained from the very similar precursors MnTp 2 and CoTp 2 are proposed to arise from the oxidizing ability of the intermediate high valent manganese oxide layers and lack thereof for cobalt...|$|E
40|$|Deactivation of a Co {{catalyst}} {{prepared as}} thin film by magnetron sputtering was studied for the sodium borohydride (SB) hydrolysis reaction under different conditions. Under high SB concentration in single run experiments, {{the formation of}} a B-O passivating layer was observed after 1. 5 and 24 h use. This layer was not responsible for the catalyst deactivation. Instead, a peeling-off mechanism produced the loss of cobalt. This peeling-off mechanism was further studied in cycling experiments (14 cycles) under low SB concentrations. Ex-situ study of catalyst surface after use and solid reaction products (precipitates) was performed by X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The presence of cobalt hydroxide and oxyhydroxide was detected as major components on the catalyst surface after use and as precipitates in the supernatant solutions after washing. <b>Cobalt</b> <b>borate,</b> cobalt carbonate and oxycarbonate were also formed but in lesser amounts. These oxidized cobalt species were formed and further detached from the catalyst {{at the end of the}} reaction and/or during catalyst washing by decomposition of the unstable in-situ formed cobalt boride. Leaching of cobalt soluble species was negligible. Thin film mechanical detachment was also found but in a smaller extent. To study the influence of catalyst composition on deactivation processes, cycling experiments were performed with Co-B and Co-C catalysts, also prepared as thin films. We found that the deactivation mechanism proposed by us for the pure Co catalyst also occurred for a different pure Co (prepared at higher pressure) and the Co-B and Co-C samples in our experimental conditionsPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Co-B alloy {{has been}} {{deposited}} on steel from an alkaline citrate bath. Uniform deposits {{have been obtained}} in the current density range of 8 - 15 Adm- 2. Cyclic voltammetric studies on platinum from this bath reveal that the cobalt citrate complexes undergo stepwise electronation with the participation of hydroxyl ions. The borates undergo reduction to boron in the alloy deposition. The hydrogen evolution reaction {{has been found to}} be hindered by <b>cobalt</b> and <b>borate</b> ions. Stripping voltammetric curves on the alloy film suggest the dissolution of cobalt from a cobalt rich phas...|$|R
50|$|The first cobalt violet, the {{intensely}} red-violet cobalt arsenate, {{was highly}} toxic. Although it persisted in some paint lines into the twentieth-century, it was displaced by less toxic cobalt compounds such as cobalt phosphate. Cobalt violet {{appeared in the}} second half of the 19th century, broadening the palette of artists. Cobalt violet was used by Paul Signac (1863-1935), Claude Monet (1840-1926), and Georges Seurat (1859-1891). Today, cobalt ammonium phosphate, cobalt lithium phosphate, and cobalt phosphate are available for use by artists. Cobalt ammonium phosphate is the most reddish of the three. Cobalt phosphate is available in two varieties — a deep less saturated blueish type and a lighter and brighter somewhat more reddish type. Cobalt lithium phosphate is a saturated lighter-valued bluish violet. A color similar to cobalt ammonium phosphate, <b>cobalt</b> magnesium <b>borate,</b> was introduced in the later twentieth-century but was not deemed sufficiently lightfast for artistic use. Cobalt violet is the only truly lightfast violet pigment with relatively strong color saturation. All other light-stable violet pigments are dull by comparison. However, the high price of the pigment and the toxicity of cobalt has limited its use.|$|R
40|$|Only a {{few studies}} (Ref. 1, 2) have been devoted to the {{boration}} of cobalt. I Attention {{has been given to}} a study of <b>borating</b> <b>cobalt</b> and alloys based;,/upon it {{due to the fact that}} one of the cobalt alloys (K&NJOIM) is used for tne manufacture of nonmagnetic, corroslöhäry stable springs and core samples of electrical measuring instruments. In addition, the Ixardness of core samples from this'alloy, which equals HRC 58 - 0 I, is insufficient for certain instruments. Therefore it is of practical interest to study the possibilities of increasing the hardness of this alloy by means of boration. I BORATION OF COBALT IBoration was done by electrolysis in a melted drill and in a melted draw with the introduction of boron carbides (up to 30 - 40 $ by weight). The latter boration method i...|$|R
40|$|Thin films {{containing}} first-row {{transition metals}} {{are widely used}} in microelectronic, photovoltaic, catalytic, and surface-coating applications. In particular, metallic films are essential for interconnects and seed, barrier, and capping layers in integrated circuitry. Traditional vapor deposition methods for film growth include PVD, CVD, {{or the use of}} plasma. However, these techniques lack the requisite precision for film growth at the nanoscale, and thus, are increasingly inadequate for many current and future applications. By contrast, ALD is the favored approach for depositing films with absolute surface conformality and thickness control on 3 D architectures and in high aspect ratio features. However, the low-temperature chemical reduction of most first-row transition metal cations to their zero-valent state is very challenging due to their negative electrochemical potentials. A lack of strongly-reducing coreagents has rendered the thermal ALD of metallic films an intractable problem for many elements. Additionally, several established ALD processes for metal films are plagued by low growth rates, impurity incorporation, poor nucleation, high surface roughness, or the need for hazardous coreagents. Finally, stoichiometric control of ternary films grown by ALD is rare, but increasingly important, with emerging applications for metal borate films in catalysis and lithium ion batteries. The research herein is focused toward the development of new ALD processes for the broader application of metal, metal oxide, and metal borate thin films to future nanoscale technologies. These processes display self-limited growth and support the facile nucleation of smooth, continuous, high-purity films. Bis(trimethylsilyl) six-membered rings are employed as strongly-reducing organic coreagents for the ALD of titanium and antimony metal films. Additionally, new processes are developed for the growth of high-purity, low-resistivity cobalt and nickel metal films by exploiting the redox non-innocent nature of a series of recently-reported 1, 4 -di-tert-butyl- 1, 3 -diazabutadienyl complexes. Other metal complexes using the same ligand system are subsequently evaluated for use as ALD precursors. Finally, a novel approach is described for the stoichiometric control of first-row transition metal manganese and <b>cobalt</b> <b>borate</b> films, whereby the film composition is governed by the elements present in a single precursor. Computational techniques such as density functional theory (DFT) using nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) are used to determine the electronic structure and predict the relative reducing power of organic coreagents. Potential ALD precursors are analyzed by 1 H and 13 C NMR, IR, thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses (TGA/DTA), melting point and solid state decomposition measurements, magnetic susceptibility measurements, preparative sublimation studies, and solution-screening reactions. Deposition parameters are optimized for successful ALD processes. The composition and surface morphology of the resultant films are studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF-ERDA), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and four-point probe resistivity measurements...|$|E
