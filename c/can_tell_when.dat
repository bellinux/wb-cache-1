Beginners can find this information through research and classes. Tasting soap for readiness is not recommended, as sodium and potassium hydroxides, when not saponified, are highly caustic.|$|E

500|$|Although Hamming {{had been}} hired to work on {{elasticity}} theory, he still {{spent much of his}} time with the calculating machines. Before he went home on one Friday in 1947, he set the machines to perform a long and complex series of calculations over the weekend, only to find when he arrived on Monday morning that an error had occurred early in the process and the calculation had errored off. Digital machines manipulated information as sequences of zeroes and ones, units of information that Tukey would christen [...] "bits". If a single bit in a sequence was wrong, then the whole sequence would be. To detect this, a parity bit was used to verify the correctness of each sequence. [...] "If the computer <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> an error has occurred," [...] Hamming reasoned, [...] "surely there is a way of telling where the error is so that the computer can correct the error itself." ...|$|E

500|$|Of {{the three}} schools, St. Lulim has the least {{emphasis}} on romance between characters, although the Lulim characters are typically found together. The leader of their friendly group is Chikaru Minamoto, the student council president of Lulim, and a born leader. She has a friendly and supportive personality which she often uses to offer advice {{or simply a}} shoulder to cry on. The other three girls include Kizuna Hyūga, a very outgoing and excitable girl who enjoys following Chikaru's decisions, finding fun in doing so. She is very expressive in her actions and words, not wasting a chance to introduce herself to anyone new. Her close friend is Remon Natsume, who is much like Kizuna in personality, but is not as accident-prone as her. Of the pair, Kizuna is the more talkative; Remon often agrees with her companion and will offer up an opinion when need be. Lastly, there is Kagome Byakudan, {{the youngest of the}} group, who is typically accompanied by her stuffed bear [...] which she often talks to as if it were alive. Although she does not talk or express her emotions much, she has a heightened perception of others' emotions and <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> those around her are distraught or in emotional pain.|$|E
2500|$|Awesome's initial {{releases}} {{also included}} entirely new properties which were generally received more favorably {{than either the}} Extreme or Maximum lines had been. These included Kaboom, created by artist Jeff Matsuda (and written by Loeb), which dealt with main character Geof Sunrise, who on his sixteenth birthday is given [...] "access to the Kaboom Power Cycle, the mystic source of all power", and subsequently hunted by [...] "the Nine, a group of demons". Artist Ian Churchill created two series—Coven and Lionheart (both also written by Loeb). Coven (which followed a fairly regular bi-monthly publishing schedule between August 1997 and July 1998 for its first 6-issue series) was a supernatural, [...] "Heaven vs. Hell" [...] title, featuring the titular group. [...] "The Coven" [...] {{was made up of}} [...] "Fantom (half-human vampiress); Spellcaster (white witch with owl familiar); Scratch (Catholic priest possessed by a demon); Blackmass (leader, descendant of Cain); and Phenomena (<b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> trouble's a-brewing)", and featured [...] "a healthy mix of lightheartedness and horror". Lionhearts two issues told the story of Karen Quinn, an archaeologist accidentally transformed into Lionheart, a warrior [...] "infused with a divine power tracing back to the Garden of Eden and the expulsion of Adam and Eve." ...|$|E
2500|$|The colon is {{wrinkled}} and corrugated, {{somewhat like}} an accordion or a clothes-dryer exhaust tube, which gives it the {{large surface area}} needed for water absorption. [...] In order to inspect this surface thoroughly the physician blows it up like a balloon, using an air compressor, {{in order to get}} the creases out. [...] The stomach, intestines and colon have a so-called [...] "second brain" [...] wrapped around them, which autonomously runs the chemical factory of digestion. [...] It uses complex hormone signals and nerve signals to communicate with the brain and the rest of the body. [...] Normally a colon's job is to digest food and regulate the intestinal flora. [...] The harmful bacteria in rancid food, for example, creates gas. The colon has distension sensors that <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> there is unexpected gas pushing the colon walls out—thus the [...] "second brain" [...] tells the person that he or she is having intestinal difficulties by way of the sensation of nausea. [...] Doctors typically recommend either total anaesthesia or a partial twilight sedative to either preclude or to lessen the patient's awareness of pain or discomfort, or just the unusual sensations of the procedure. [...] Once the colon has been inflated, the doctor inspects it with the scope as it is slowly pulled backwards. [...] If any polyps are found they are then cut out for later biopsy.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{believed}} that Lynch was going to retire from the film industry; according to Abel Ferrara, Lynch [...] "doesn't even want to make films any more. I've {{talked to him about}} it, OK? I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> he talks about it." [...] However, in a June 2012 Los Angeles Times interview, Lynch stated that he lacked the inspiration to start a new movie project, but [...] "If I got an idea that I fell in love with, I'd go to work tomorrow". In September 2012, Lynch appeared in the three-part [...] "Late Show" [...] arc on FX's Louie as Jack Dahl. In November 2012, Lynch hinted at plans for a new film while attending Plus Camerimage in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Speaking at the festival, Lynch said [...] "something is coming up. It will happen but I don't know exactly when". At Plus Camerimage, Lynch was also presented with a lifetime achievement award and the key to the city by Bydgoszcz's mayor Rafał Bruski. During an interview with the Los Angeles Times in January 2013, frequent Lynch collaborator Laura Dern confirmed she and Lynch are planning a new project, and The New York Times later revealed Lynch is working on the script. Idem Paris, a short documentary film about the lithographic process, was released online in February 2013. On June 28, 2013, a music video directed by Lynch for the Nine Inch Nails song [...] "Came Back Haunted" [...] was released. He also did photography for the self-titled album from Dumb Numbers released August 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{said after}} the game, {{referring}} to being drafted late [...] "I {{think a lot of}} people thought I had a lot of wear and tear on me, too much, so they didn’t know how much I have left, I just kind of laughed it off. I still feel good, and I think because of all that I’ll never be complacent. I feel like I want to prove myself even more, and prove a lot of people wrong. Everything happens for a reason, though." [...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can tell by the cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E
