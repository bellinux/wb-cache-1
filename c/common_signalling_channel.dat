40|$|The CCS 7 is a Common Channel {{signalling}} system. That is, {{instead of}} signalling {{being associated with}} each traffic channel, a <b>common</b> <b>signalling</b> <b>channel</b> is used for all circuits. This signalling in telecommunication network establishes and realizes temporary connections, {{in accordance with the}} instructions and information received from subscriber lines and inter- exchange trunks, in the form of various signals. Therefore, it is necessary to interchange information between subscriber lines and between different exchanges. Though these signals may differ widely in their implementation they are collectively known as telephone signals.

Unfortunately WLAN systems based on the IEEE 802. 11 standard lead to poor performance for such multiâ€“hop networks. Therefore, we introduce a new MAC protocol for IEEE 802. 11 that needs only marginal changes in the standard, but offers high connectivity and high throughput values. We advocate {{the use of a}} <b>common</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>channel</b> for the task of assigning channels among wireless terminals in an IEEE 802. 11 a based ad hoc network. Our approach separates the RTS/CTS signaling from the data exchange. By means of this separation all wireless nodes are forced to listen to one domain, on which the channel assignment process takes place. After a four way RTS/CTS handshake, data transmission occurs on a dedicated channel. Due to this new scheme collisions are reduced. The <b>common</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>channel</b> helps also find the appropriate node for routing and achieves a high connectivity level among wireless nodes...|$|R

40|$|Ad hoc {{communication}} is gaining popularity in recent times, {{not only for}} pure ad hoc communication networks {{but also as a}} viable solution for coverage extension in wireless networks. Especially for upcoming WLAN hotspots this is an interesting option to decrease installation costs. In this paper we introduce a new MAC protocol that needs only marginal changes to the standard and enables e#cient multi [...] hop networking. We advocate the use of multiple IEEE 802. 11 channels, where one channel is reserved as a <b>common</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>channel</b> for the task of assigning the others ("data channels") among wireless terminals. The proposed MAC protocol is based on a four way handshake over the <b>common</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>channel,</b> while data transmission occurs on a dedicated channel. We propose a further optimization applying multiple wireless network interface cards. This improvement in performance comes at the price of a slightly more complex hardware. Two di#erent simulation models are implemented to investigate our approach. The first model investigates the MAC protocol and its improvements while the second model analyzes the multi [...] hop performance in terms of delivery ratio and transmission delay. By means of numerous simulations we present the performance of our MAC approach in comparison with two standard approaches in terms of bandwidth, packet delivery, and transmission delay. For our performance evaluation we apply the IEEE 802. 11 a technology, but we note that our approach can also be used for IEEE 802. 11 b...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel service-oriented network architecture {{to bridge the}} informational gap between user applications and optical networks providing technology-agnostic multigranular optical network services for clouds. A mediation layer (service plane) between user applications and network control is proposed to facilitate a mapping process between user application requests and the network services. At the network level, a multigranular optical network (MGON) is proposed and implemented to support dynamic wavelength and subwavelength granularities with different transport formats [optical burst switched (OBS), optical burst transport (OBT) ], reservation protocols (one-way, two-way), and different quality-of-service (QoS) levels per service type. The service-oriented multigranular optical network has been designed, implemented, and demonstrated on an experimental testbed. The testbed consists of service and network resource provisioning, service abstraction, and network resource virtualization.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{distributed}} sum-rate maximization in small cell networks in the special case where users have incomplete information about the interfering cross-channels. The sum-rate maximization problem admits a decentralized solution based on pricing mechanism. This requires the exchange of some control parameters (prices) over a <b>common</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>channel.</b> In femtocell networks, this exchange of control data may occur through the wired backhaul (e. g., an ADSL channel) connecting the femto-access points (FAP's). The problem with the implementation of pricing is that it requires knowledge of the cross channels between the interfering nodes and this information typically is not available. In this paper, we address this problem by using only statistical information about the cross-channels. This leads to a Bayesian pricing mechanism. We start modeling the interference mechanism through a directed random graph. Then, we model the interference incorporating the fading statistics and the spatial distribution of the nodes. We provide a closed form expression for the expected value of the pricing term and derive distributed schemes able to converge to a stationary point of the sum-utility function. Finally, we compare the proposed approach to a purely competitive mechanism and to a clairvoyant (gene-aided) scheme...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a Blind Source Separation (BSS) {{algorithm}} for multichannel audio contents is proposed. Unlike common BSS algorithms targeting stereo audio contents or {{microphone array}} signals, our technique is targeted at multichannel audio such as 5. 1 and 7. 1 ch audio. Since most multichannel audio object sources are panned using the Inter-channel Loudness Difference (ILD), we employ the ILVS (Inter-channel Loudness Vector Sum) concept to cluster <b>common</b> <b>signals</b> (such as background music) from each channel. After separating the <b>common</b> <b>signals</b> from each <b>channel,</b> we employ an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with a von-Mises distribution to successfully classify the clustering of sound source objects and separate the audio {{signals from the}} original mixture.
