5|$|O'Connor {{made two}} {{arguments}} for the dissenting justices: that predisposition was proven {{by the fact}} that Jacobson had ordered materials both times he was actually solicited, and that the <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> usurped the jury's rightful role in deciding whether he was entrapped. She also expressed fears that the <b>court</b> <b>had</b> so broadened the definition of predisposition as to make it a viable defense in almost any case.|$|E
5000|$|The Superior <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{inherent}} {{jurisdiction over}} civil, criminal, and family law matters at common law. [...] Although the <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> inherent jurisdiction, {{the authority of}} the <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> been entrenched in the Canadian Constitution.|$|R

5|$|Schmerber v. California, , was a {{landmark}} United States Supreme Court {{case in which}} the Court clarified the application of the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless searches and the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for searches that intrude into the human body. Until Schmerber, the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> not yet clarified whether state police officers must procure a search warrant before taking blood samples from criminal suspects. Likewise, the <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> not yet clarified whether blood evidence taken against the wishes of a criminal suspect may be used against that suspect {{in the course of a}} criminal prosecution.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the second}} time the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> granted certiorari to the Oneida's land claim. Over a decade earlier, in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (1974), the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> allowed the same suit to proceed by {{unanimously}} holding that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the claim. Since then, Justices William O. Douglas and Potter Stewart had departed, replaced by John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.|$|E
5|$|Black was {{the author}} of the {{landmark}} decision in Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), which ruled that the states must provide an attorney to an indigent criminal defendant who cannot afford one.

5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of John Paul Stevens in June 2010, the <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> an entirely non-Protestant composition {{for the first time}} in its history. Although Neil Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, attends an Episcopalian church, he was raised Catholic and it is unclear if he considers himself a Catholic or a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the first}} time the <b>court</b> <b>had</b> {{considered}} an entrapment case from outside the realm of controlled-substance enforcement, or one involving conduct that had only recently been criminalized. By relying exclusively on whether the defendant had a predisposition to commit the crime, the court appeared to have finally resolved a lingering issue in its previous decisions on the subject.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>court</b> <b>has</b> {{original}} jurisdiction {{and general}} superintendent control over inferior {{courts in the}} judiciary and agencies, commissions and boards exercising power under the constitution.

If in any event there is any conflict in determining which <b>court</b> <b>has</b> jurisdiction, the state supreme court is granted the power to determine which <b>court</b> <b>has</b> jurisdiction, with no appeal from the court's determination.|$|R
50|$|Discretionary {{jurisdiction}} is {{a circumstance}} where a <b>court</b> <b>has</b> {{the power to}} decide whether to hear a particular case brought before it.

5|$|Parker's <b>court</b> <b>had</b> final {{jurisdiction}} over the Indian Territory from 1875 until 1889, as there was no court available for appeals. The legal systems and governments of the Five Civilized Tribes and other Native American tribes in the Indian Territory covered their own citizens, and federal law applied to non-Indian United States citizens in the territory.|$|E
5|$|President Roosevelt sought {{re-authorization}} of NIRA on February 20, 1935. But {{the backlash}} against the New Deal, coupled with continuing congressional concern over the Act's suspension of antitrust law, left the President's request politically dead.

50|$|In {{cases such as}} Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, , New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, , R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992) and others, the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{addressed}} {{various areas}} of controversial speech.

50|$|The <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> {{original}} jurisdiction, and has general superintendent {{control over}} all inferior {{courts in the}} judiciary, {{as well as all}} agencies, commissions and boards exercising power under the constitution. The <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> appellate jurisdiction co-extensive with that of the state’s borders on all cases “at law and in equity” except criminal cases, in which the Court of Criminal Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction.

5|$|The Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> other, limited {{sources of}} appellate {{jurisdiction}} in criminal cases. The Court could hear criminal appeals {{from the state}} courts by writ of error, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Court could hear federal criminal appeals by certificate of division, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1802, original habeas petition, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789, and mandamus, as authorized by the same act. Between 1867 and 1868, and after 1885, the <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> jurisdiction to hear writs of error from habeas petitions (a civil action) in the circuit courts. Beginning in 1850, the Court also entertained such appeals from the territorial courts. Attempts to utilize other prerogative writs as sources of jurisdiction were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The statute {{essentially}} codifies the Tea Rose-Rectanus doctrine, {{established by}} the United States Supreme Court in two cases decided in 1916 and 1918. The <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> established in those cases that a junior user of a mark that is geographically remote from the senior user of the mark may establish priority over a senior user's claim to the mark in the junior user's area.|$|E
5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court. The note argued that establishing such broad legal precedent was outside the bounds of {{the authority of the}} Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court was right to reverse. Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> in the past.|$|E
40|$|Several {{states have}} enacted {{statutes}} to protect minors from harmful or obscene materials disseminated over the Internet, {{as well as}} from pedophiles seeking to use the Internet to lure them into sexual conduct. State and federal <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> diverged in their analysis of the Dormant Commerce Clause 2 ̆ 7 s impact on state regulation in these areas. While state <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> held that the Dormant Commerce Clause does not invalidate state luring statutes, federal <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> been consistent in finding state dissemination statutes unconstitutional. This iBrief summarizes recent state and federal jurisprudence in this area and concludes that state <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> not been successful in distinguishing state luring statutes from federal case law on state dissemination statutes. Therefore, state <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> prematurely aborted the Dormant Commerce Clause examination...|$|R

5|$|According to Congress, {{the federal}} court for the Western District of Arkansas was to meet in four {{separate}} terms each year: in February, May, August, and November. The <b>court</b> <b>had</b> such a large caseload that the four terms ran together. Parker's court sat {{six days a week}} {{in order to ensure that}} they tried as many cases as possible each term, and often up to ten hours each day. In 1883, Congress reduced the jurisdiction of the court, reassigning parts of the Indian Territory to federal courts in Texas and Kansas; however, the increasing number of settlers moving into the Indian Territories actually increased the court's workload.|$|E
5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, the Court {{that only}} {{meant that the}} {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not that {{the statute of limitations}} would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held that the statute of limitation did not apply, not that it would not bar the claim if it applied, and the District <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> held the claim barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E
5|$|At his request, Ginsburg {{administered}} Vice President Al Gore's oath {{of office}} to a second term during the second presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton on January 20, 1997. She was the third woman to administer an inaugural {{oath of office}}. Ginsburg {{is believed to be}} the first Supreme Court justice to officiate a same sex-wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony of Kennedy Center President Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist. Earlier that summer, the <b>Court</b> <b>had</b> bolstered same-sex marriage rights in two separate cases. Ginsburg believed the issue being settled led same-sex couples to ask her to officiate as there was no longer the fear of compromising rulings on the issue.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from its}} general {{equitable}} jurisdiction, the <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> jurisdiction {{over a number}} of other matters. First, the <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> sole power to appoint guardians of the property and person for mentally or physically disabled Delaware residents. Similarly, the Court may also appoint guardians for minors, although the Family <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> coterminous jurisdiction over such matters. Will contests and disputes over interpretations of trusts are also heard by the Court.|$|R
60|$|This, plainly stated, is your language. Perhaps {{you will}} say the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>has</b> decided the disputed Constitutional {{question}} in your favor. Not quite so. But waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and decision, the <b>court</b> <b>has</b> decided {{the question for}} you {{in a sort of}} way. The <b>court</b> <b>has</b> substantially said, it is your constitutional right to take slaves into the Federal Territories, and to hold them there as property.|$|R
5|$|Federal appeals <b>courts</b> <b>have</b> {{been divided}} {{on whether the}} Hazelwood case applies to college newspapers, a {{question}} the Supreme Court left open. <b>Courts</b> <b>have</b> also been split on viewpoint-based expression in schools, such as religious expression.|$|R
