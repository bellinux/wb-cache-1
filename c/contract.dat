5|$|Section 2 {{gives the}} third party various protections {{once they have}} chosen to enforce the act - the parties cannot alter or end the <b>contract</b> if the third party has told them that he wishes to enforce the <b>contract</b> or relied on the <b>contract</b> (and the {{promisor}} knows this or {{could be expected to}} have known this). If the <b>contract</b> is breached, the third party has all the rights that he would have if he had been a party to the initial <b>contract.</b>|$|E
5|$|This decree allowed {{someone who}} {{purchased}} a <b>contract</b> to void the <b>contract</b> with a payment of only 3.5 {{percent of the}} <b>contract</b> price (or about 1/30 the <b>contract).</b> Thus, investors bought increasingly expensive contracts. A speculator could sign a <b>contract</b> to purchase a tulip for 100 guilders. If the price rose above 100 guilders, the speculator would pocket the difference as profit. If the price remained low, the speculator could void the <b>contract</b> for only 3½ guilders. Thus, a <b>contract</b> nominally for 100 guilders, would actually cost an investor no more than 3½ guilders. In early February, as <b>contract</b> prices reached a peak, Dutch authorities stepped in and halted the trading of these contracts.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally Burger King {{has sold}} soft drinks from the Coca-Cola Company in its home market.

The company won the <b>contract</b> by strengthening the marketing and advertising program ties between Burger King and itself.

30|$|Second, {{so far we}} have {{considered}} as temporary <b>contracts</b> all fixed-term <b>contracts,</b> including training and apprenticeship <b>contracts.</b> If all temporary <b>contracts</b> were training and apprenticeship <b>contracts,</b> the probability of training for a temporary worker would be equal to one. Thus, the inclusion of these two types of <b>contracts</b> in our sample may bias downwards the negative effect of holding temporary <b>contracts</b> on the probability of training. In column [6] we present estimates using the restricted sample of temporary <b>contracts.</b> Given that the number of training and apprenticeship <b>contracts</b> is very small (28 observations), the difference with the previous estimate is almost negligible.|$|R

5|$|A {{legal battle}} that began {{the same year}} {{interfered}} with the band's working on another release.

According to Volcano, Tool had violated their <b>contract</b> when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a countersuit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their <b>contract,</b> the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new <b>contract,</b> a three-record joint venture deal. In 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement.|$|E

5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the Blue Jackets, Filatov signed a three-year <b>contract</b> with the club on July 10, 2008. His base salary for the <b>contract</b> was $875,000, with bonus clauses that could bring the value as high as $1.35million per season. His signing with Columbus created some {{controversy}} within the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), however, as League President Alexander Medvedev claimed that the Blue Jackets owed CSKA Moscow compensation of at least $1.5million for signing Filatov. Medvedev claimed that although the term of the <b>contract</b> had expired, under Russian law it did not terminate until an indemnity amount had been negotiated. The Blue Jackets and Filatov believed that giving his club 30 days notice was sufficient to terminate the <b>contract.</b> CSKA threatened to withhold Filatov's transfer card, thus impeding his ability to play in another league, but Filatov, his lawyers and the Blue Jackets believed they had followed the necessary tenets of Russian law. Filatov's <b>contract</b> was one of six reviewed by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) {{in an attempt to}} mediate the disputes between the KHL and NHL. During this investigation, the players were unable to play international hockey sanctioned by the IIHF. In September, the KHL dropped its opposition to Filatov's <b>contract</b> with the Blue Jackets, and he received his transfer.|$|E
