Quantity flexibilities allow the buyer to get a different quantity than the earlier estimate (Lariviere 1999; Fugate et al. 2010) and this can be provided in various ways, such as minimum purchase quantity agreement (Bassok and Anupindi 1997), backup agreements that allow a customer to purchase higher quantities than initial amounts they ordered (Eppen and Iyer 1997) Quantity flexibility also considered as a major form of supply <b>chain</b> <b>agreement</b> (Tsay 1999). Sharafali and Co (2000) also suggested different types of coordination systems, for instance, price fluctuation and quantity discounts. Apart from it, the determinants such as flexibility, mutual benefit, harmonization of conflict, and information sharing are also found to be crucial in coordinating supply chains (Achrol and Gregory 1999; Carson Stephen et al. 1999; Houston and Johnson 2000; Jap Sandy and Ganesan 2000; Maloni and Benton 2000; Poppo and Zenger 2002).|$|E

40|$|Advances in {{computing}} {{and networking}} technology, and {{an explosion in}} information sources {{has resulted in a}} growing number of distributed systems getting constructed out of resources contributed by multiple sources. Use of such resources is typically governed by sharing agreements between owning principals, which limit both who can access a resource and in what quantity. Despite their increasing importance, existing resource management infrastructures offer only limited support for the expression and enforcement of sharing agreements, typically restricting themselves to identifying compatible resources. In this paper, we present a novel approach building on the concepts of tickets and currencies to express resource sharing agreements in an abstract, dynamic, and uniform fashion.

30|$|It is well {{recognized}} {{that in order}} to combat climate change, GHG emissions need to be managed from the supply chain perspective. This paper moves one more step forward on the base of literature by introducing one concept—supply chain emission trading and one framework in addressing emission trading in the context of supply chains. To implement the supply chain emission trading, this paper proposed to assign the responsibility of supply chain GHG emissions to the focal company in the supply chain by including the scope 3 emissions of the focal company into ETS. Moreover, this paper discerns itself from others by identifying risks for supply chains under emission trading program. From a corporate perspective, these risks are from policy instability, market variation, supply <b>chain</b> <b>agreement</b> dispute, green investment uncertainty, and supply chain GHG emission accounting failure. Moreover, based on the concept of supply chain risks, this paper attributes green investment risks to internal and external risks, policy and market risks to supply chain environmental risks, accounting risks to internal risks, and agreement risks to external risks.|$|E

40|$|The {{system of}} Sicilian durum wheat is facing, as indeed is {{happening}} to the entire food system, the evolution of consumption patterns toward higher quality requirements: health-wise, primarily, but also including some intangible requirements. Recent acquisitions {{in the field of}} healthy food, have called attention to some specific characteristics of Sicilian durum wheat. The durum wheat sector represents a major landmark for regional agriculture, being by far the most widespread arable crop in Sicily; a crop that, over the past 30 years, has evolved considerably, due to the impact of EU regulations. Currently, the whole Sicilian cereal-pasta chain shows shortcomings in organization and size, which severely limit the production of pasta with a significant loss of added value, linkable to its specificity characteristics. The study confirmed the substantial absence of a supply chain for Sicilian durum wheat although there have been attempts, even by the regional government, to build a <b>chain</b> <b>agreement</b> aimed at starting a virtuous process of governance of the quality system for cereals. There is a need, however, for commitment in training {{at all levels of the}} supply chain, and the promotion of a culture of sharing of common goals as well as collaboration among the operators, is essential...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new duality between the F-terms of supersymmetric field {{theories}} defined in two- and four-dimensions respectively. The duality relates N= 2 supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions, deformed by an Omega-background in one plane, to N=(2, 2) gauged linear sigma-models in two dimensions. On the four dimensional side, our main example is N= 2 SQCD with gauge group SU(L) and 2 L fundamental flavours. Using ideas of Nekrasov and Shatashvili, {{we argue that}} the Coulomb branch of this theory provides a quantization of the classical Heisenberg SL(2) spin <b>chain.</b> <b>Agreement</b> with the standard quantization via the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz implies {{the existence of an}} isomorphism between the chiral ring of the 4 d theory and that of a certain two-dimensional theory. The latter can be understood as the worldvolume theory on a surface operator/vortex string probing the Higgs branch of the same 4 d theory. We check the proposed duality by explicit calculation at low orders in the instanton expansion. One striking consequence is that the Seiberg-Witten solution of the 4 d theory is captured by a one-loop computation in two dimensions. The duality also has interesting connections with the AGT conjecture, matrix models and topological string theory where it corresponds to a refined version of the geometric transition.

Since the meat is not yet ready, the present paper is, in part, an analysis of the preliminary modification of the operative context and, in part, a previsional examination of the possible effect of the activation of this production chain on the area. The results investigated economic, social, landscape, technical and technological (related to food safety) elements. It can be observed, by an introductive evaluation, that this productive circuit may valorize the resources of this mountain area and can enhance zootechnics in mountain areas. The guidelines allow a vertical integration throughout the production path, coordinating all the operators. This type of production can be considered a niche product, related to the territory, with the maximum guarantee for the consumers. The environmental worthiness is the recovering and the improving of these marginal, agricultural areas.

Value chains (or supply chains) play an {{important}} role in business today, but because many attorneys do not understand how supply chains differ from conventional sale of goods contracts, they may have difficulty contributing value to the process of negotiating supply chain deals. Thinking of supply chains as being either adversarial or collaborative can help managers work with their lawyers to identify the right contract terms for a much wider range of supply chain business models. Hot spots in supply <b>chain</b> <b>agreements</b> include harmonizing risk allocations, technology implementation, performance metrics, forecasting, intellectual property rights and termination. The Nature of the Problem. What are value chains (also known as supply chains) and how do they differ from older systems for managing production and distribution of goods and services? A supply chain can be defined as an integrated network of firms sequentially involved in the production and distribution of goods and services. These networks have grown in number and economic significance in recent years. Among the forces spurring supply chain expansion are increased competition caused by the global integration of product markets, greater profits possible in a well managed supply chain, and advances in informatio...|$|R

A case study has been conducted with a large brewery company as the case organization. We have been looking at the use of mobile ICT and how the sales consultants relate to the recently implemented mobile applications. The main research question is: How can mobile workers relate to recently implemented mobile ICT? In addition to this, there are three sub questions. Fourteen sales consultants have participated in this study. The focus has lied on their use of two J 2 ME-applications. The first application is a reporting tool for supporting the company s <b>chain</b> <b>agreements,</b> whereas the second is an application for ordering products using the mobile phone. The results from the study are presented in this thesis. The theoretical framework is based on CSCW and mobility theory. The study showed that the sales consultants approached and related differently towards the applications.

The company s actions or lack of actions towards securing application use, have also influenced the sales consultants relations to the applications.
