40|$|I {{examine the}} {{influence}} of <b>cross-border</b> <b>group</b> taxation on ownership chains for European multinational firms. I show that the tax advantages of <b>cross-border</b> <b>group</b> taxation regimes can only be exploited if a multinational firm {{has at least one}} intermediate subsidiary in the country allowing for <b>cross-border</b> <b>group</b> taxation. I use the introduction of the Austrian <b>cross-border</b> <b>group</b> taxation regime as a natural experiment to test my hypothesis. I find that the probability that a foreign parent company holds an Austrian intermediate subsidiary is significantly higher after the introduction of the group taxation regime. However, I am only able to observe this effect for parent companies already invested in Austria prior to the introduction of the <b>cross-border</b> <b>group</b> taxation regime. I am unable to provide evidence that this also holds for parent companies who are not invested in Austria prior to the introduction of the <b>cross-border</b> <b>group</b> taxation regime. My results contribute to a nascent literature that examines {{the influence of}} taxes on ownership chains, and a larger literature on (intermediate) subsidiary location decisions for multinationals. My findings provide empirical evidence that could be useful to governments in those countries attempting to reform their group taxation regimes, or who are implementing <b>cross-border</b> <b>group</b> taxation regimes for the first time...|$|E

40|$|On July 1 2010 {{new rules}} {{regarding}} <b>cross-border</b> <b>group</b> deductions came into force in Sweden. The rules {{are based on}} a series of judgements which were delivered by the Court of Justice of the European Union and subsequent rulings deriving from the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court. The new set of rules is supposed to make the Swedish group consolidation system in line with EU law in the area of <b>cross-border</b> <b>group</b> consolidations. The new rules allow a resident parent to deduct the losses stemming from its non-resident subsidiary but only if the subsidiary has exhausted all the possibilities to take those losses into account in its own state of origin and the losses cannot be utilized in the future by the subsidiary or a third party. Furthermore, the non-resident subsidiary needs to be liquidated for the parent to be able to show that the possibilities have been exhausted. However, before even considering whether the subsidiary has exhausted the losses there is one criterion that need to be fulfilled; the criterion of a wholly owned subsidiary. The criterion of a wholly owned subsidiary requires a resident parent to directly own its non-resident subsidiary without any intermediate companies and that shareholding must correspond to more than 90 percent. It is the requirement of a direct shareholding which post a concern to whether that criterion can be seen as in compliance with the case-law stemming from The Court of Justice of the European Union and the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court. After revising and analysing the case-law stemming from the Court of Justice and the Swedish Supreme Administrative Court it is the author’s belief that the criterion of a wholly owned subsidiary, due to the requirement of a direct shareholding, is not in conformity with EU law and cannot be justified by the justification grounds put forward by the Swedish government...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of tax groups {{is motivated by}} the principle of neutrality in the taxation of corporate activities: tax systems should tax the income {{in the same way}} irrespective of the organic structure adopted for that purpose. This means that a tax system should not lead to distortions only because such activity was not performed by a single company but rather through a group of companies. Tax group regimes exist in many Member States although most of them are applicable only to domestic companies. Therefore, the possibilities of <b>cross-border</b> <b>group</b> taxation are still very limited at the EU Level. The limitation of tax group benefits to domestic situations and the difference in treatment between domestic and cross-border constitute situations which may affect neutrality and therefore, create obstacles as to an efficient allocation of resources. This thesis analyses how tax treaties and EU law may contribute to remove existing obstacles to group taxation regimes, meaning the differences created by national laws between domestic and cross-border groups. This assessment is fundamentally based on the interpretation of the non-discrimination provisions in tax treaties as well as the EU fundamental freedoms. It also considers the possibility of developing new approaches based on the interpretation of tax treaties and EU law such as to extend the application of group taxation regimes to cross-border situations...|$|E

40|$|On the {{internal}} market within the EU, {{freedom of establishment}} under articles 49 and 54 TEU stipulates that companies {{have the right to}} set up businesses in other Member States. On {{the internal}} market there are 27 different national tax law systems which have caused obstacles regaring taxation between Member States. These obstacles have been shown deterrent when a company enters a new market. One problem area is the lack of cross-border loss compensation for groups. This means that <b>cross-border</b> <b>groups</b> is over taxed when they are unable to set of gains against losses. Within the EU, there is a constant process trying to resolve these problems, both short and long term. Regarding short term, the Court of Justice has presented a number of case law. The result from these is that Member States must give groups the right to crossborder loss compensation when the loss of the subsidiary is final. However, the case law did not solve the problems with over taxtion, instead they created difficulties for Member States regarding the interpretation of the cases due to the absence of a uniform principle to follow. Swedish tax legislation within the area is narrowly designed and allows cross-border loss compensation in few cases.

Then we focus on the causes of the emergence of liquidity risk in the ongoing financial crisis. We point out two intertwined processes: firstly, the huge increase in financial assets stemming from the shift to an “originate-to-distribute” intermediation model; secondly, the growth of a parallel financial circuit. After this, we focus on the main lessons for regulation and supervision: first of all we address the case for adjustments to Basel 2 in view of the nexus between solvency and liquidity. Further crucial points relate to market liquidity and OTC markets, scale and scope of LLR function, architecture of supervisory authorities and perimeter of controls.

The financial innovation within the banking industry, especially the one regarding the off-balance-sheet instruments has effects as the risk focus and the increase of volatility within the entire banking industry. As it is proved by the economic crisis, the financial stability plays an important role within the financial system as well as within the economy as a whole. At the moment, as the number of active financial institutions is getting higher and higher in one or more countries or on one or more continents, the financial stability at a worldwide level became even more important. The objective of this work is to emphasize {{the way in which the}} European banks were affected once with the global financial crisis. The economic crisis was triggered by the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers â€˜ Investment Bank, in the autumn of 2008 and its effects were felt at the level of the European financial markets, a series of <b>cross-border</b> <b>groups</b> claiming interventions of the state in order for them to be saved. The intensity of the crisis was felt and it affected many states, the impact of these ones being influenced by a series of specific factors which outlined the situation of their financial system, at the moment of the crisis release. At the level of the European Union, a series of measures have been established in order to extinguish the identified dysfunctions at a financial field level, among which we mention: the improvement of the surveillance framework of those financial institutions having cross-border activity, the expansion of the communication and cooperation among the EU surveillance authorities and the ones outside the Union, etc. The conclusions of the study of this paper work in regards to the activity of the main European banks, especially to the ones from Western Europe, is the fact that during the crisis period, they intensified their cross-border activities and increased their incomes. The increase of incomes was generated by both the fast efficient measures taken by the state and the volatility of the emergent markets.

40|$|After the {{introduction}} of the euro in 1999, the debate on the financial stability architecture in the EU focused on the adequacy of a decentralised setting based on national responsibilities for preventing and managing crises. The Financial Services Action Plan in 1999 and {{the introduction}} of the Lamfalussy process for financial regulation and supervision in 2001 enhanced the decentralised arrangements by increasing significantly the level of legal harmonisation and supervisory cooperation. In addition, authorities adopted EU-wide MoUs to safeguard cross-border financial stability.

In particular, momentous events such as the freezing of interbank markets, the loss of confidence in financial institutions, runs on banks and difficulties affecting <b>cross-border</b> financial <b>groups,</b> questioned the ability of the EU financial stability architecture to contain threats to the integrated single financial market.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the global financial crisis, both resolution planning, i. e. contingency planning by both regulated institutions and public authorities in order to prepare their actions in financial crisis, and concepts for structural bank reform have been identified as possible solutions to ending “Too Big To Fail” and foster market discipline among bank owners, bank managers and investors in bank debt. Both concepts thus complement the global quest for reliable procedures and tools for bank resolution that would minimise systemic implications once large and complex financial institutions have reached the stage of insolvency. Given the complex task of orchestrating swift and effective resolution actions, especially with regard to <b>cross-border</b> banking <b>groups</b> and financial conglomerates, planning ahead in good times has since been widely recognised as crucial for enhancing resolvability. At least part of the impediments to resolution will be found in organisational, financial and legal complexity that has evolved in banks and groups over time. To remove these impediments, interference with existing corporate and group structures is all but inevitable. However, in both international standard setting and at the European Union level, issues related to resolution planning (within the context of bank resolution reform) and structural banking reforms to date have been discussed rather separately. This lack of consistency is questionable, given the obvious need to reconcile both approaches in order to facilitate effective implementation and enforcement especially with regard to large, complex banking groups. Based on an analysis both of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the SRM Regulation, this paper explores how these problems could be dealt with {{within the context of the}} European Banking Union...|$|R
