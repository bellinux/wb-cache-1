Wittgenstein stresses the social aspects of cognition; to see how language works for most cases, we have to see how it functions in a specific social situation. It is this emphasis on becoming attentive to the social backdrop against which language is rendered intelligible that explains Wittgenstein's elliptical comment that [...] "If a lion could talk, we could not understand him." [...] However, in proposing the thought experiment involving the fictional character, Robinson Crusoe, a captain shipwrecked on a desolate island [...] with no other inhabitant, Wittgenstein shows that language is not in all cases a social phenomenon (although, they are for most cases); instead the <b>criterion</b> for <b>a</b> <b>language</b> is grounded in a set of interrelated normative activities: teaching, explanations, techniques and criteria of correctness. In short, it is essential that <b>a</b> <b>language</b> is shareable, but this does not imply that for <b>a</b> <b>language</b> to function that it is in fact already shared.|$|R

Despite this, abductive validation over LQCM using the HT 4 abductive inference engine is a useful technique for a large range of real-world theories.

Here we show that, in the special case where (i) the theory is only measured at a few time intervals and (ii) LTQCM is restricted to L Γ TQCM (which contains only bi-state objects connected by symmetrical relations) then temporal abductive validation is practical. 1 Introduction We are used to assessing representations via their soundness, completeness and their tractability.

Second, we demonstrated the practicality of the annotation process in a feasibility study. Finally, we demonstrate the computability of ERGO annotation by using it to (1) structure a library of eligibility criteria, (2) search for studies enrolling specified study populations, and (3) screen patients for potential eligibility for a study. We therefore demonstrate a new and practical method for incrementally capturing the semantics of free-text eligibility criteria into computable form...|$|R

40|$|The word {{problem of}} a finitely {{generated}} group is a fundamental notion in group theory; it {{can be defined as}} the set of all the words in the generators of the group that represent the identity element of the group.

Another interesting problem is that of characterizing which languages are word problems of groups. There is a known necessary and sufficient <b>criterion</b> for <b>a</b> <b>language</b> to be <b>a</b> word {{problem of a}} group; however a natural question is what other characterizations there are.

In philosophy, {{the term}} {{ontology}} {{has been used}} since the 17 th century to refer both to a philosophical discipline (Ontology with a capital “O”), and as a domain-independent system of categories {{that can be used}} in the conceptualization of domain-specific scientific theories. In the past decades there has been a growing interest in the subject of ontology in computer and information sciences. In the last few years, this interest has expanded considerably in the context of the Semantic Web and MDA (Model-Driven Architecture) research efforts, and due to the role ontologies are perceived to play in these initiatives. In this paper, we explore the relations between Ontology and ontologies in the philosophical sense with domain ontologies in computer science.

However, solid research in children is missing. Objective: This study evaluated the DSM-Criteria A 1 and A 2 in predicting {{posttraumatic stress}} in children. Method: A sample of 588 Dutch school children, aged 8 - 18 years, completed a self-report questionnaire {{to determine if they}} met <b>Criteria</b> <b>A</b> 1 and/or A 2. Their posttraumatic stress response was assessed using the Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale. Results: The contribution of <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 2 to the prediction of posttraumatic stress in children is of greater importance than the contribution of <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 1. Children who met <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 2 reported significantly higher levels of posttraumatic stress and were nine times more likely to develop probable PTSD than children who did not meet <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 2. When <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 1 was met, a child was only two times more likely to develop probable PTSD as compared with those where <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 1 was not met. Furthermore, the low sensitivity of <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 1 suggests that children may regularly develop severe posttraumatic stress in the absence of <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 1. The remarkably high negative predictive value of <b>Criterion</b> <b>A</b> 2 indicates that if a child does not have a subjective reaction during an event that it is unlikely that he or she will develop PTSD.
