The experimental work was carried out on a vertical CNC machining center with 7, 500 rpm spindle rotation and 7. 5 kW power. Hardened steels ASTM H 13 (50 HRC) were machined at conventional cutting speed and high-speed cutting (HSC). TiN coated carbides with seven different geometries of <b>chip</b> <b>breaker</b> were applied on dry tests. A special milling tool holder with only one cutting edge was developed and the machining forces needed to calculate the specific cutting energy were recorded using a piezoelectric 4 -component dynamometer. Workpiece roughness and chip formation process were also evaluated. The results showed that the specific cutting energy decreased 15. 5 % when cutting speed was increased up to 700 %. An increase of 1 ° in tool <b>chip</b> <b>breaker</b> chamfer <b>angle</b> lead to a reduction in the specific cutting energy about 13. 7 % and 28. 6 % when machining at HSC and conventional cutting speed respectively.

This aim requires reliable machining processes. The chip control {{is one of}} major concern in automated machining system. It {{is essential for the}} safety of the machining operation, the maintenance of good surface finish on the machined parts, the convenience of chip disposal, and the possible power reduction. This thesis major deals with theoretical modelling for the 3 -D chip curling process, including geometry and mechanics consideration. These models are then used to develop a computer animation system to simulate the process of chip curling in 3 -D metal cutting. Hence the work described in this thesis is devoted to developing an effective theoretical technique for chip control in automated machining systems. Firstly, a new method to describe the development process of 3 -D chip curling is developed in accord with the mechanics and kinematics characters of chip curling in 3 -D machining. This analysis divided the process of 3 -D chip development into different stages based on the deformation mechanism and characteristics, i. e. chip forming stage, chip curling stage, chip breaking stage, and the kinematical characters according to whether the curled chip, after leaving the rake face, hits the backwall of breaker/groove, or/and workpiece, or/and backface of tool, or/and extends along the <b>chip</b> <b>breaker.</b> Then new basic chip curling forms, up-curling, side-curling and twisting, are proposed based on the continuum mechanics theory. It reveals that a 3 -D curling chip body m a y undergo longitudinal bending, transversal bending and torsional deformations. The analysis provides the fundament for the theoretical modelling of the 3 -D chip curling and breaking. Secondly, a general geometric model of 3 -D chip curling generated by typical <b>chip</b> <b>breakers</b> is developed by introducing the three-dimensional deformation state of the chip curling. The model, so developed, can be used to predict the 3 -D chip curling forms. The prediction includes a group of criteria for the effects of ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηo on the chip forms/shapes. The varying tendency of the chip radius and chip pitch with varying ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηO is further discussed based on a sensitivity analysis the results of which are summarised graphically. The sensitivity analysis provides a quantitative assessment of the significance of three basic chip curling forms, namely up-curling, side-curling and twisting to the general helical chip form. Thirdly, a set of 3 -D mechanics models of chip curling with <b>chip</b> <b>breaker</b> for the internal resisting forces is developed for the 4 basic chip deformation cases of chip curling process based on the structural mechanics theory, These internal forces, in particular the bending moments and torques are expressed as variations along the length of the curled chip. The set of models considers a spatial force system including the longitudinal bending moment, transversal bending moment and the torsional torque. Then the distribution of the bending moments and torques along the chip body are discussed based on graphically presented calculated results. The models reveal, in theory, new insights into the chip breaking mechanisms. More importantly it provides a new approach to theoretically asses the curling chip breakability. Notably it is shown that the bending moment and torque are the main causes of chip breaking. Furthermore the bending moment and torque in the chip body are caused by the <b>chip</b> <b>breaker</b> and the obstacle the curling chip contacts. Finally, a computer animation system for 3 -D chip curling in machining process is developed based on the 3 -D chip curling developing process, geometry model and mechanics models of 3 -D chip curling presented in the research work. The 3 -D chip animation integrates the chip flow equation, chip curling patterns, chip geometrical features and mathematical expressions for the 3 -D helix surface. Based on the input conditions (namely <b>chip</b> <b>breaker</b> parameters and cutting conditions), a computer program is developed to convert the parametric prediction into a series of dynamic graphs demonstrating the chip formation process.

Distinct feed rate values were tested using uncoated carbide tool (grade K 15) without <b>chip</b> <b>breaker.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the chip compression ratio (Rc), chip deformation (e), friction angle (q), shear angle (U), normal stress (r), and shear stress (). In general, similar results were obtained when comparing the results obtained using Merchant model with the exper-imental findings...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCutting tool {{development}} is still driven {{by trial and}} error and therefore requires various prototypes and modifications. The normal manufacturing process for carbide cutting inserts includes die production, pressing, sintering, grinding and coating. A laser can provide an easy and economical way to make modifications and prototypes out of pressed inserts. The paper compares a normal pressed and ground insert with the same geometry using various laser manufacturing options. The insert features a wiper geometry for high feed per revolution and a <b>chip</b> <b>breaker.</b> As performance criteria the cutting forces and the machined surface quality were measured and analysed. It was found that the cutting edge and surface quality of the insert depends on the laser strategy and thus influences the cutting force and the workpiece quality. No difference was discovered comparing ground and laser machined inserts showing the potential for prototyping...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{processes}} significantly {{influence the}} type of surface that is being produced. The quality of the surface dictates the functional performance and service-life of engineered components. Residual stresses and surface roughness {{are some of the}} important constituents of these manufactured surfaces. Hence, knowledge about factors that cause residual stresses will contribute to a better fundamental understanding of manufacturing process mechanics and improved knowledge-driven manufacturing process planning. This thesis presents the results of an experimental investigation into the effects of cutting tool coatings and materials, and cutting fluid (CF) application, on residual stresses in machined 7075 -T 6 and 2024 -T 351 aluminum alloys measured using the hole-drilling method. Machining is performed with flat faced and grooved (<b>chip</b> <b>breaker)</b> TiN, TiB 2 coated carbide tools, and uncoated polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tools in three CF application conditions: dry, minimal quantity lubrication (MQL), and flood conditions. PCD is not a coating but is treated as a thick macro coating for the sake of comparison...|$|R
40|$|The damping {{capacity}} of cast graphitic aluminum alloy composites has been measured using a torsion pendulum {{at a constant}} strain amplitude. It was found that flake-graphite particles dispersed in the matrix of aluminum alloys increased the {{damping capacity}}; the improvement was greater, the higher the amount of graphite dispersed in the matrix. At sufficiently high graphite contents the damping capacity of graphitic aluminum composites approaches that of cast iron. The ratio between the damping capacity and the density of graphitic aluminum alloys is higher than cast iron, making them very attractive as light-weight, high-damping materials for possible aircraft applications. Machinability tests on graphite particle-aluminum composites, conducted at speeds of 315 sfm and 525 sfm, showed that the chip length decreased {{with the amount of}} graphite of a given size. When the size of graphite was decreased, at a given machining speed, the chip length decreased. Metallographic examination shows that graphite particles act as <b>chip</b> <b>breakers,</b> and are frequently sheared parallel to the plane of th...|$|R
50|$|Monel R-405 is {{the free}} {{machining}} version of Monel 400. It is a nickel-copper alloy with a controlled amount of sulfur added to provide sulfide inclusions {{that act as}} <b>chip</b> <b>breakers</b> during machining. Like Monel 400, alloy R-405 is resistant to sea water and steam at high temperatures {{as well as to}} salt and caustic solutions. Monel R-405 is a solid solution alloy that can only be hardened by cold working. This nickel alloy exhibits characteristics like good corrosion-resistance, good weldability and high strength. A low corrosion rate in rapidly flowing brackish or seawater combined with excellent resistance to stress corrosion cracking in most freshwaters combined to its resistance to a variety of corrosive conditions justifies its wide use in marine applications and other non-oxidizing chloride solutions. This nickel steel alloy is particularly resistant to hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids when they are de-aerated. As would be expected from its high copper content, alloy R-405 is rapidly attacked by nitric acid and ammonia systems.|$|R
40|$|Machining {{of metals}} {{is the most}} {{universal}} and major stage of manufacturing system. It involves forcing of the cutting tool through the excess material of the work-piece, thereby rendering work-piece to a desired shape and size. So in present modern technology processes, optimization of machining parameters {{is one of the}} key necessities. For the case of turning operation, unbroken chips pose a major obstacle for maintaining accurate machining processes. The continuous chip generated during turning operation deteriorates the work-piece precision and causes safety hazards for the operator. Effective chip control is necessary for automatic production system because any failure in chip control can cause the lowering in productivity and the worsening in operation due to frequent stop. Chip control in turning is difficult in the case of stainless steel because chips are continuous. So the development of a <b>chip</b> <b>breaker</b> for stainless steel is an important topic for the automation of turning operations. In this study, the role of different parameters like speed, feed and depth of cut are studied. ...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium based {{materials}} gain {{in importance}} for light weight components, but the increasing demands for better properties often {{require the use}} of special alloys or composites. Furthermore, specific surface properties are necessary in order to ensure the proper functioning. During the investigation {{it was found that the}} grain size in the surface layer of hypoeutectic AlSi alloys can be reduced by machining with modified cutting edge tools. The microstructure of the AlSi alloys has high potential for reducing the running-in time of motor components. Another challenge described in the paper is the precision machining of particle reinforced aluminium matrix composites. It was found that the surface roughness can be improved when using tools with appropriate <b>chip</b> <b>breakers</b> and a specially designed corner geometry. In addition forming of micropores could be reduced by using tools with a smaller corner radius, which leads to higher compressive stresses in the surface layer during cutting. All tests were carried out with diamond tipped inserts on a precision lathe with emulsion as the cooling lubricant...|$|R
