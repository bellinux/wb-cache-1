2500|$|Plaster mold casting is a {{metalworking}} {{casting process}} similar to sand casting except the molding material is plaster of Paris instead of sand. Like sand <b>casting,</b> <b>plaster</b> mold casting is an expendable mold process, however {{it can only}} be used with non-ferrous materials. It is used for castings as small as [...] to as large as [...] Generally, the form takes less than a week to prepare. Production rates of 1–10units/hr can be achieved with plaster molds.|$|E
2500|$|Casting is a {{group of}} {{manufacturing}} processes by which a liquid material (bronze, copper, glass, aluminum, iron) is (usually) poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solid casting is then ejected or broken out to complete the process, although a final stage of [...] "cold work" [...] may follow on the finished cast. Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that cold set after mixing of components (such as epoxies, concrete, plaster and clay). Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods. The oldest surviving casting is a copper Mesopotamian frog from 3200 BC. Specific techniques include lost-wax <b>casting,</b> <b>plaster</b> mold casting and sand casting.|$|E
6000|$|I first [...] "realised" [...] Fourteenth Street at a {{very tender}} age, and I {{perfectly}} recall that flush of initiation, consisting as it did of an afternoon call with my father at a house there situated, one of an already fairly mature row {{on the south side}} and quite near Sixth Avenue. It was as [...] "our" [...] house, just acquired by us, that he thus invited my approval of it--heaping as that does once more the measure of my small adhesiveness. I thoroughly approved--quite as if I had foreseen that the place was to become to me for ever so long afterwards a sort of anchorage of the spirit, being at the hour as well a fascination for the eyes, since it was there I first fondly gaped at the process of [...] "decorating." [...] I saw charming men in little caps ingeniously formed of folded newspaper--where in the roaring city are those quaint badges of the handicrafts now?--mounted on platforms and <b>casting</b> <b>plaster</b> into moulds; I saw them in particular paste long strips of yellowish grained paper upon walls, and I vividly remember thinking the grain and the pattern (for there was a pattern from waist-high down, a complication of dragons and sphinxes and scrolls and other fine flourishes) a wonderful and sumptuous thing. I would give much, I protest, to recover its lost secret, to see what it really was--so interesting ever to retrace, and sometimes so difficult of belief, in a community of one's own knowing, is the general æsthetic adventure, are the dangers and delusions, the all but fatal accidents and mortal ailments, that Taste has smilingly survived and after which the fickle creature may still quite brazenly look one in the face. Our quarter must have bristled in those years with the very worst of the danger-signals--though indeed they figured but as coarse complacencies; the age of [...] "brown stone" [...] had just been ushered in, and that material, in deplorable, in monstrous form, over all the vacant spaces and eligible sites then numerous between the Fifth and Sixth Avenues, more and more affronted the day. We seemed to have come up from a world of quieter harmonies, the world of Washington Square and thereabouts, so decent in its dignity, so instinctively unpretentious. There were even there spots of shabbiness that I recall, such as the charmless void reaching westward from the two houses that formed the Fifth Avenue corner to our grandfather's, our New York grandfather's house, itself built by him, with the happiest judgment, not so long before, and at no distant time in truth to be solidly but much less pleasingly neighboured. The ancient name of the Parade-ground still hung about the central space, and the ancient wooden palings, then so generally accounted proper for central spaces--the whole image infinitely recedes--affected even my innocent childhood as rustic and mean. Union Square, {{at the top of the}} Avenue--or what practically then counted for the top--was encased, more smartly, in iron rails and further adorned with a fountain and an aged amateur-looking constable, awful to my generation in virtue of his star and his switch. I associate less elegance with the Parade-ground, into which we turned for recreation from my neighbouring dame's-school and where the parades deployed on no scale to check our own evolutions; though indeed the switch of office abounded there, for what I best recover in the connection is a sense and smell of perpetual autumn, with the ground so muffled in the leaves and twigs of the now long defunct ailanthus-tree that most of our own motions were a kicking of them up--the semi-sweet rankness of the plant was all in the air--and small boys pranced about as cavaliers whacking their steeds. There were bigger boys, bolder still, to whom this vegetation, or something kindred that escapes me, yielded long black beanlike slips which they lighted and smoked, the smaller ones staring and impressed; I at any rate think of the small one I can best speak for as constantly wading through an Indian summer of these disjecta, fascinated by the leaf-kicking process, the joy of lonely trudges, over a course in which those parts and the slightly more northward pleasantly confound themselves. These were the homely joys of the nobler neighbourhood, elements that had their match, and more, hard by the Fourteenth Street home, in the poplars, the pigs, the poultry, and the [...] "Irish houses," [...] two or three in number, exclusive of a very fine Dutch one, seated then, this last, almost as among gardens and groves--a breadth of territory still apparent, on the spot, in that marginal ease, that spread of occupation, to the nearly complete absence of which New York aspects owe their general failure of [...] "style." ...|$|E

However these three techniques (sand, plaster and lost wax) are not directly comparable as each utilizes a one-time use or expendable mold.|$|E
50|$|Ice sculptures, ice walls {{for fire}} fighting, {{property}} protection and cooling stations may be cast {{by a process}} in which ice water (one part), crushed ice or ice cubes (three parts) and tiny, floating, dry ice pellets (one part) are placed in a cement mixer. The tiny dry ice pellets super cool the ice water so that the ice water acts like glue to cement or freeze the crushed ice or ice cubes together within several seconds once the mixture stops moving within the mold. The ice water component of the mixture will expand 9% on freezing, so rubber, foam or foam lined casting materials work best to combat the water to ice expansion problem not encountered with wax, cement, <b>casting</b> <b>plaster</b> or metal casting materials.|$|E

Background: Historically, orthodontists have taken dental measurements on <b>plaster</b> <b>casts.</b> Recently, technological advances have given orthodontists {{the ability to}} take dental measurements on digital models. It was the goal of this study to assess the accuracy, reproducibility, and time-efficiency of measurements taken on three digital models and compare them to the gold standard <b>plaster</b> <b>casts.</b> Methods: Three operators measured tooth widths on 30 sets of dental models. Toothwidth measurements were recorded and timed for <b>plaster</b> <b>casts,</b> SureSmile diagnostic casts (OraMetrix, Richardson, Texas), emodels (Geodigm, Minneapolis, Minnesota), and AnatoModels (Anatomage, San Jose, California). To assess accuracy and reproducibility, the Altman-Bland agreement and mean squared error were calculated for individual teeth. Differences in time-efficiency among the types of dental casts were tested for statistical significance using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s method as a post hoc pairwise comparison procedure. Results: SureSmile diagnostic casts were most accurate when compared to <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> followed by emodels and AnatoModels. SureSmile diagnostic casts were also the most reproducible dental casts. emodels were the quickest to complete tooth-width measurements, followed by SureSmile diagnostic <b>casts,</b> <b>plaster</b> <b>casts,</b> and AnatoModels. Conclusions: Tooth-width measurements were most accurate and reproducible on SureSmile diagnostic casts. Measurements taken on emodels and SureSmile diagnostic casts were clinically significantly faster when compared to <b>plaster</b> <b>casts</b> and AnatoModels...|$|R

50|$|Plaster {{and other}} {{chemical}} curing {{materials such as}} concrete and plastic resin may be cast using single-use waste molds as noted above, multiple-use 'piece' molds, or molds made of small rigid pieces or of flexible material such as latex rubber (which is in turn supported by an exterior mold). When <b>casting</b> <b>plaster</b> or concrete, the material surface is flat and lacks transparency. Often topical treatments are applied to the surface. For example, painting and etching {{can be used in}} a way that give the appearance of metal or stone. Alternatively, the material is altered in its initial casting process and may contain colored sand so as to give an appearance of stone. By casting concrete, rather than plaster, it is possible to create sculptures, fountains, or seating for outdoor use. A simulation of high-quality marble may be made using certain chemically-set plastic resins (for example epoxy or polyester which are thermosetting polymers) with powdered stone added for coloration, often with multiple colors worked in. The latter is a common means of making washstands, washstand tops and shower stalls, with the skilled working of multiple colors resulting in simulated staining patterns as is often found in natural marble or travertine.|$|E
