40|$|Gothenburg {{introduced}} a time-of-day dependent cordon-based congestion charging scheme in January 2013. This paper explores how {{the introduction of}} the Gothenburg congestion charging scheme has affected trip tour and trip chaining behavior, using panel surveys conducted in 2012 and 2013, before and after the Gothenburg congestion charging began. This study proposes a typology of trip tour and trip chaining behavior based on organization of trips. Further, the study develops a series of indicators to characterize trip chains and trip tours patterns. Descriptive analysis is used to compare travel patterns before and after congestion pricing at the daylevel, tour-level and stage-level. The analysis results show that car travelers not only suppress activities to a small extent but also tend to have simpler tour patterns after the congestion charges implementation. The adaptation patterns reduce <b>charges</b> <b>paid</b> to some extent. In general, the reorganization of activities taken from on the way from work/school to home contributes greatly to reducing the congestion <b>charges</b> <b>paid.</b> A linear model is also developed to identify the effects of socio-demographic factors and contextual factors on the amount of <b>charges</b> <b>paid</b> based on panel data...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine reimbursement trends for emergency provider professional services following the balance billing ban in California. Methods: We conducted a blinded web-based survey to collect claims data from emergency providers and billing companies. Members of the California Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians (California ACEP) reimbursement committee were invited to participate in the survey. We used a convenience sample of claims to determine payment rates before and after the balance billing ban. Results: We examined a total of 55, 243 claims to determine the percentage of <b>charges</b> <b>paid</b> before and after the balance billing ban took effect on October 15, 2008. The overall reduction in percentage of <b>charges</b> <b>paid</b> was 13 % in the first year and 19 % in the second year following the balance billing ban. The average percentage of <b>charges</b> <b>paid</b> by health plans decreased from 91 % to 86 % from 2008 to 2010. Payments by risk-bearing organizations decreased from 72 % to 46 % of charges during the same time frame. Conclusion: Payment rates by subcontracted risk-bearing organizations for non-contracted emergency department professional services declined significantly following the balanced billing ban whereas payment rates by health plans remained relatively stable.
