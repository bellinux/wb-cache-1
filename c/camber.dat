5|$|<b>Camber</b> Castle, {{also known}} {{formerly}} as Winchelsea Castle, is a 16th-century Device Fort, built near Rye by King Henry VIII {{to protect the}} Sussex coast of England against French attack. The first fortification on the site was a small, round artillery tower, constructed by Henry between 1512 and 1514, overlooking the <b>Camber</b> anchorage and the entrance to Rye Harbour. In 1539, increasing tensions with France encouraged Henry to rethink his coastal defence plans, and <b>Camber</b> Castle was rebuilt and extended {{over the next year}} {{under the direction of the}} Moravian engineer, Stefan von Haschenperg. The results were considered unsatisfactory and further work was carried out from 1542 to 1543, at great expense, to rectify the problems. The result was a large, concentric artillery fort, with a central keep, surrounded by four circular bastions and a circular entrance bastion, built from stone and brick.|$|E

5|$|In July 1545, the French {{carried out}} a raid at nearby Seaford, and the castle may have seen action against the French fleet. Soon, however, silt began to block the {{entrance}} to the <b>Camber,</b> threatening its use as an anchorage. Complaints were made to Parliament about the situation in 1548, and the authorities in Rye expressed fears in 1573 that the <b>Camber</b> was damaged beyond repair. By the end of the century, the reclamation of the surrounding marshes and the dumping of ballast by passing ships had accelerated the natural processes and the anchorage was ruined. The surrounding region was also less strategically important than it had once been: towns like Winchelsea and Rye were in decline, peace had been made with France in 1558 and military attention shifted towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England.|$|E
5|$|The state took <b>Camber</b> Castle into {{guardianship}} in 1967, and {{the next}} year the government began a slow process of restoring the castle with the intention of eventually reopening it to the public, their efforts largely focusing on protecting the internal brick walls and wall-cores. Further excavations followed in the 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|When {{civil war}} broke out in 1642 between the {{supporters}} of Charles and those of Parliament, <b>Camber</b> Castle had not been entirely closed and was {{being used as a}} royal munitions store. The citizens of Rye sided with Parliament, which agreed that the weapons and stores in the castle should be removed and taken to the town for safe-keeping. Concerned that it might be seized by Royalist forces, Parliament went on to dismantle the castle over the next year, stripping the lead from the roof, blocking up the gunports and demolishing the living accommodation. As a result, <b>Camber</b> Castle was not used by the Royalists during the Second English Civil War in 1648, despite several other of the Device Forts along the south coast being occupied.|$|E

5|$|In 1539 {{the threat}} of {{invasion}} from France and Spain grew and Henry issued orders for his coastal defences to be improved, creating a sequence of fortifications called the Device Forts across England.

5|$|The French {{invasion}} {{emerged in}} 1545, when Admiral Claude d'Annebault crossed the Channel and arrived off the Solent with 200 ships on 19 July. Henry's fleet made a brief sortie, before retreating safely behind the protective fortifications. Annebault landed a force near Newhaven, during which <b>Camber</b> Castle may have fired on the French fleet, and on 23 July they landed four detachments on the Isle of Wight, including {{a party that}} took the site of Sandown Castle, which was still under construction. The French expedition moved further on along the coast on 25 July, bringing {{an end to the}} immediate invasion threat. Meanwhile, on 22 July the French had carried out a raid at Seaford, and <b>Camber</b> Castle may have seen action against the French fleet. A peace treaty was agreed in June 1546, bringing an end to the war. By the time that Henry died the following year, in total the huge sum of £376,000 had been spent on the Device projects.|$|E
5|$|With this knowledge, {{and a more}} {{accurate}} Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider. Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, they made the airfoil flatter, reducing the <b>camber</b> (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord). The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully confident in their new wind tunnel results, the Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their designs on their own calculations.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} procedure for optimizing circulation control airfoils, {{which consists of}} the coupling of an optimization scheme with a viscous potential flow analysis for blowing jet, is presented. The desired airfoil is defined {{by a combination of}} three baseline shapes (<b>cambered</b> ellipse, and <b>cambered</b> ellipse with drooped and spiralled trailing edges). The coefficients of these shapes are used as design variables in the optimization process. Under the constraints of lift augmentation and lift-to-drag ratios, the optimal airfoils are found to lie between those of <b>cambered</b> ellipse and the drooped trailing edge, towards the latter as the angle of attack increases. Results agree qualitatively with available experimental data...|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century <b>Camber</b> Castle and the {{surrounding}} farmland remained in private ownership and open to visitors. In the 1931 there was a proposal to turn the keep into a golf clubhouse but the project was not taken forward and the facility was built at the nearby Castle Farm instead. A research team from the Victoria County History project visited the castle in 1935, resulting in the first – albeit cursory – historical analysis and survey of the fortification being published two years later.|$|E
5|$|Civil {{war broke}} out across England in 1642 between the {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament. Fortifications and artillery {{played an important role}} in the conflict, and most of the Device Forts saw service. The south and east of England were soon largely controlled by Parliament. The blockhouses at Gravesend and Tilbury were garrisoned by Parliament and used to control access to London. The castles along the Sussex and Kentish coastline were seized by Parliament in the opening phase of the war, <b>Camber</b> Castle then being decommissioned to prevent it being used by the enemy, the remainder continuing to be garrisoned. The royal fleet, which had been positioned in the Downs anchorage, sided with Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being an}} {{artillery}} tower {{with a flat}} roof to carry heavy guns, the tower was not initially supplied with any artillery and was therefore unable to protect Rye against the hostile naval expeditions which attacked the coast in the 1520s. After many letters to from Guldeford to the Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, some guns finally arrived around 1536 {{in the form of}} wrought iron serpentines. Prescient concerns began to be raised in the mid-1530s about whether the <b>Camber</b> might silt up further and ultimately become unusable as an anchorage.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} large-eddy {{simulations of}} symmetric and asymmetric (<b>cambered)</b> airfoils forced to undergo deep dynamic stall {{due to a}} prescribed pitching motion. Experimental data in terms of lift, drag, and moment coefficients are available for the symmetric NACA 0012 airfoil and these are used to validate the large-eddy simulations. Good agreement between computed and experimentally observed coefficients is found confirming {{the accuracy of the}} method. The influence of foil asymmetry on the aerodynamic coefficients is analysed by subjecting a NACA 4412 airfoil to the same flow and pitching motion conditions. Flow visualisations and analysis of aerodynamic forces allow an understanding and quantification of dynamic stall on both straight and <b>cambered</b> foils. The results confirm that <b>cambered</b> airfoils provide an increased lift-to-drag ratio and a decreased force hysteresis cycle in comparison to their symmetric counterpart. This may translate into increased performance and lower fatigue loads when using <b>cambered</b> airfoils in the design of vertical axis turbines operating at low tip-speed ratios...|$|R

5|$|Experiments {{showed the}} need for {{only a small number}} of design changes, mainly {{involving}} the wing profile and positioning. To improve high-alpha performance, the leading edge of the wing was drooped, especially on outer sections, a dog-tooth was introduced at about half-span to control spanwise flow, and the entire wing given a slight negative <b>camber</b> which helped control trim drag and pitch-up. The area rule principle, made public in 1952, was also applied to the design. This resulted in several changes including the addition of a tailcone, sharpening the radar nose profile, thinning the intake lips, and reducing the cross-sectional area of the fuselage below the canopy.|$|E
5|$|In 1593 {{there was}} a fresh crisis with Spain and the brass guns needed for the English navy were in short supply. Brass {{artillery}} pieces were therefore rounded up from the forts along the south coast, including <b>Camber.</b> The number of guns at the castle remained around the same, but the larger, brass culverins and demi-cannon were removed, being replaced with smaller iron demi-culverins, sakers and a minion. In 1594 another royal survey suggested that £95 of repair work was needed on the fortifications.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, archaeological {{interest}} in the castle grew. From 1951 onwards the Ministry of Works carried out a long-running research project into the Device Forts, the section on <b>Camber</b> being written by the historian Martin Biddle and finally published in 1982. Biddle carried out an exploratory archaeological survey of the site in 1962 and the following year the ruins were closed to allow more extensive archaeological excavation by the Ministry. These were initially carried out by Biddle and Alan Cook, with support from local school children and from young offenders from the Borstal institution in Dover.|$|E
