40|$|Polyelectrolytes and oppositely charged {{surfactants}} interact through attractive electrostatic forces, {{which in}} many cases lead to phase separation already at low total concentrations. During the past 10 - 15 years investigations of these systems have been simplified {{through the use of}} <b>complex</b> <b>salts</b> that consist of surfactants with polymeric counterions in a 1 : 1 charge stoichiometry (no excess simple counterions present). The approach of using <b>complex</b> <b>salts</b> enables these systems to be described in two dimensions in truly ternary phase diagrams, which is not possible if the polyelectrolyte and the surfactant, including their original simple counterions, are mixed. One of the aims of this thesis was to investigate how mixtures of water-insoluble <b>complex</b> <b>salts</b> are affected by addition of nonionic surfactants in aqueous solution. Both the ternary phase behavior and the different liquid crystalline phases that form as well as the solution behavior have been investigated as nonionic surfactants are added. It was demonstrated that the prescence of ethoxylated entities in the polyion-surfactant ion aggregates promote solubility and that the addition of nonionic surfactants to insoluble <b>complex</b> <b>salts</b> give rise to a rich phase behavior. In fact, the presence of liquid crystalline phases in equilibrium with a dilute aqueous phase facilitated the formation of stable dispersions of nanoparticles with a bicontinuous cubic internal structure. Moreover, it was possible to tune this structure by means of temperature. Soluble <b>complex</b> <b>salts</b> consisting of a cationic surfactant and oppositely charged copolymers with grafted poly(ethylene oxide) side chains were also investigated. These <b>complex</b> <b>salts</b> were found to form micelles with a hydrodynamic radius of around 200 nm in size, which suggests that they mostly contain only one polyion. It was also observed that these systems displayed a well-defined CMC equivalently to surfactants in aqueous solution. The release of a polyion from oppositely charged mixed micelles was investigated in one of the studies. For this purpose a cationic and cleavable surfactant (decyl betainate) which is hydrolyzed at high pH, was used. Decyl betainate formed insoluble aggregates together with the polyion. These aggregates were then solubilized by C 12 E 8. It was revealed that the rate of hydrolysis of decyl betainate was decreased with the polyion present in the system. It was also shown that the polyion was released into solution as the surfactant was degraded...|$|R

Detailed analysis of the net energetics of <b>complex</b> <b>salt</b> bridge formation using double- and triple-mutant cycle analysis revealed conflicting results.

In one case, it was reported that <b>complex</b> <b>salt</b> bridge formation is anti-cooperative. To resolve these different findings, we performed analysis of the geometries of salt bridges in a representative set of structures from the PDB and found that over 87 % of all <b>complex</b> <b>salt</b> bridges anchored by Arg/Lys have a geometry such that the angle formed by their Cα atoms, Θ, is < 90 °.

It was found that PAA is a much less selective “solvent” to P 104 molecules than water. P 104 aggregates are disintegrated and thus the liquid crystalline structures are destroyed upon replacement of water by PAA. Oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, DNA (double- or single-stranded) and two cationic derivatives of the hydroxyethyl cellulose (cat-HMHEC and cat-HEC) were mixed in water. An asymmetric associative phase separation was observed: small amounts of cat-(HM) HEC could precipitate DNA but large amounts of DNA were needed to precipitate the polycations. The rheological properties of the off-stoichiometric one-phase mixtures were investigated. The viscosity increased as the polymer content was increased and showed an interesting non-monotonic behaviour for the cat-HEC/dsDNA/H 2 O system. Redissolution of insoluble polyion-surfactant ion <b>complex</b> <b>salts</b> by adding excess surfactant was investigated using the simple approach of preparing the <b>complex</b> <b>salts</b> and mixing them with excess surfactant.
