40|$|Introduction In {{recent years}} {{due to lack}} of water {{resources}} in our country, planting of bare root seedlings of onion has been welcomed by farmers. Considering the desired high dense planting of Iranian farmers, lack of proper transplanting machine has appeared as the main problem. To overcome this problem, some researchers tested a few methods, but none of them reached to complete successfully. As the one of last efforts, Taki and Asadi (2012) developed a semi-automatic transplanting machine with 9 planting units. This machine requires to 9 men to separate and single out a bunch of seedlings. Usage of this machine is very time-consuming and labor intensive. In Iran, transplanting of bare root seedlings is practically performed by hand with a density of 700 - 800 thousand plants at hectare. The main {{purpose of this study was}} designed, manufacture, and evaluation of an automatic metering device that with the separation and singulars of bare root seedlings of onion could get a high density planting. Materials and Methods Fig. 1 shows the main employed idea of this research for separation and single out a bunch of seedlings. As shown in Fig. 1, the metering device consisted of two carrying and separating belts with different teeth forms. Placing seedling bunches between the two belts, the belts move at different speeds in opposite directions and separate seedlings from their bunch. For proper design of metering device system, measurement of some physical properties were necessary. The obtained information was used to select two belts form. A belt with flexible plastic teethes with a height of 6 mm and the distance of 4 mm was selected as separator while for carrier, two types of belts were selected: the first was the same as a separator and the second was made of metal teethes. Based on the average thickness of seedling bunch and some pre-tests, the horizontal angle of separator belt determined as α= 20 degrees. Theoretical calculations were done to computatingof the needed force of the system. In this section, seedlings were modeled as some solid cylinders with a length of 200 and a diameter of 10 mm. In the mentioned system, it was necessary that the speed of separator belt is more than the speed of <b>carrier</b> <b>belt.</b> Thus, ratio of two linear velocities () of 1. 67 and 2. 32 were considered for evaluation of the system. For evaluation of manufactured metering device, the effects of three factors, i. e., <b>carrier</b> <b>belt</b> type, ratio of linear velocities of the belts, and number of seedlings in a bunch (n = 30 and n = 60), on qualitative planting parameters were studied in a factorial experiment based on completely randomized design with three replications. The studied qualitative planting parameters were miss index, consumed seedlings, miss length, quality of feed index, multiple index, mean, and damaged seedlings. Results and Discussion The results of analysis of variance showed that, except of belt type, effects of the two studied factors and all interactions are statistically non-significant on consumed seedlings and miss length indexes. The results indicated significant differences between miss index (P< 0. 01), multiple index (P< 0. 05), and mean (P< 0. 05) as affected by belt type. None of the studied variable had a significant effect on damaged seedlings. Interactions of belt type and ratio of linear velocities significantly affected the quality of feed index (P < 0. 01). An increase in ratio of linear velocities in plastic toothed belt lead to decrease of mean and miss indexes, whereas in case of metal toothed belt there is no significant effect on this two indexes. The results also showed that increase of linear velocities for the two types of <b>carrier</b> <b>belt</b> lead to increase of consumed seedlings and decrease of miss length. At the two ratios of linear velocities, miss length in metal toothed is less than plastic toothed belt. Conclusions Commercial transplanting machines are not suitable for dense planting of onion. In this research an automatic metering device for separation and singularize of bare root seedlings of onion was manufactured and evaluated. The results indicated that the <b>carrier</b> <b>belt</b> with long and rigid teeth, having an angle of attack, could separate seedlings more efficiently. The results also showed a 80 percent increased in uniformity of plant seedlings distances is reachable using the metering system...|$|E

5000|$|Johnston {{was still}} {{the owner of the}} Mount Molloy sawmill when it burnt down on 31 January 1934, William J Santowski being the manager at the time. It was {{reported}} that [...] "One 350 h.p. boiler was in the destroyed building, also one Sandycroft steam engine; one twin circular log breaking down plant, four saw benches, one planing machine, saw-dust <b>carriers,</b> <b>belting,</b> shafting and pulleys and other tools of various descriptions, 29 circular saws, one log rolling winch, two saw sharpening machines, three cross-cut sawing machines". However, the employees were able to protect the boiler, main engines and pumping plant from serious damage. There were also two other planing machines in a separate building that was not destroyed. Prior to the fire Johnston had purchased machinery for a new sawmill at Shipton's Flat near Cooktown, and after the fire he placed some of the machinery at Mount Molloy. He claimed that the latter was a paying proposition and a very essential part of his organisation. It was also essential to have the mill at Mount Molloy, as most hardwood supplies came from there.|$|R

5000|$|The Stoner 63/63A is {{chambered}} for the now-standard 5.56×45mm intermediate rifle cartridge. When in the belt-fed role, {{the weapon}} would feed from a disintegrating metallic linked belt marked [...] "S-63 BRW" [...] {{which is a}} scaled-down version of the U.S. M13 link developed for the M60 GPMG. The Stoner 63/63A will not work reliably with the later M27 link developed for the M249 SAW. The belt is normally contained in a 150-round plastic ribbed container that has a tab allowing it to be clipped on {{to the side of}} the left-hand feed tray. Early ammunition boxes were olive drab in color and manufactured at Costa Mesa, this later changed to a black-colored plastic container made in Warren, Michigan. Stoner 63A boxes were also black but had a reduced capacity of 100 rounds as the larger container would unbalance the rifle. These can either be attached to the left-hand feed tray or held in a bottom box carrier when using the right-hand feed mechanism. Several drum-type <b>belt</b> <b>carriers</b> were designed for the left-hand feed system, with a 150-round drum container being the most popular and used frequently by SEALS in Vietnam. A 250-round drum carrier was also developed by NAWS China Lake, but this proved too heavy and cumbersome. SEALS would also resort to converting RPD <b>belt</b> <b>carriers</b> for use with their Stoners. The detachable magazines used in the Rifle, Carbine and Automatic Rifle models are fabricated from steel and weigh 8 oz unloaded. In an effort to reduce weight, aluminum magazines were later developed cutting the weight down to 4 oz. Standard magazines have a 30-round cartridge capacity but a 20-round magazine was also offered.|$|R

Belted ammunition is introduced into the feed tray port from the left side, while the magazine is inserted vertically into the magazine well {{at the base of the}} receiver.

40|$|China {{free trade}} zone is an {{important}} <b>carrier</b> of the <b>Belt</b> and Road to achieve {{the internal and external}} linkage. There are four {{free trade zone}}s in china. They are in Shanghai, Guangdong, Tianjin and Fujian. Fujian free trade zone supplies greater openness and favorable policies for Xiamen international shipping center, and dispenses with the formalities, reduces shipping costs, and realizes the territory of the commissioner of policies. So it will be in favor of FDI and benefited for employment-generating. It will boost the economy and increase international trade. Firstly this paper found out the influence factors of Fujian free trade zone to Xiamen international shipping center through the investigation. Then index system of these influencing factors was designed. And then the index system was designed into a questionnaire. Relevant experts filled the questionnaire. Then the main influence factors and secondary influence factors were been found. The weights of each index were got by using the method of analytic hierarchy. At last, development strategies of Xiamen international shipping center were been proposed...|$|R
40|$|New {{approaches}} for wafer manufacturing generate silicon substrates {{as thick as}} foils (50 – 80 μm) by using the thermal-mechanic behavior of silicon and a previously deposited stress—inducing layer. After the detachment from a ‘parent‘ ingot the generated silicon wafer samples may be heavily bound and deformed due to the applied stress layer. A cleaning step by a wet chemical process solves the attached stress-inducing layer and allows to unbend the substrate in the cleaning bath. The scope of this work {{is the development of}} an automated handling process for the shapetransforming substrates during cleaning. Thus, the goal of this thesis is to develop a reliable and reproducible automated handling process for the removal of highly sensitive silicon substrates from a cleaning process bath. The in-process transforming substrate cannot be supported by <b>carriers</b> or <b>belts</b> and requires the direct removal by pneumatic grippers from the liquid. The theoretical process model focuses on the detection of the flat substrate in the cleaning basin. The advanced complication of the substrate detection in the liquid is given by considering different conditions of the liquid cleaning bath. As a feedback control a developed handling quality number allows to integrate the substrate detection evaluation in combination with the handling result. Thus, the stabilization of the handling results by the selection of appropriate parameters was enabled and characterized. Taking into consideration the Advanced-Process-Control method a control framework which integrates the detection and the handling quality result was developed for a continuous process run. The setup of an experiment platform enables to test the handling functions in both single and integrated ways. Significant parameters were identified as well as the restrictions and opportunities due to appearing process forces during the handling in the liquid. As a result, the control framework had to act in almost every fifth handling cycle, determining the bath condition and adapting the amount of the detection requests. The result classification again reveals, that a good detection information and an average handling speed for the removal allows to achieve stable handling process results. The development shows a high degree of fulfillment in terms of the identified process requirements. The verified removal process of ultra-thin silicon substrates from a liquid bath is feasible and demonstrates the automated direct handling for future immersion bath process applications in photovoltaics cell or analogous productions...|$|R
