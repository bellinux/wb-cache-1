Barristers in protest of the cuts refused the instructions to act on behalf of the Defendants at the reduced fees so no suitably qualified barristers could be found to represent the Defendants. As the Defendants {{would not be able to}} have a fair trial without suitable representation (in breach of their right to a fair trial) the <b>case</b> could <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> and was stayed.

[...] Italy invaded France towards the end of June 1940. On 8 July, without any obvious reason, the police arrested Turroni in Vichy. At about this time a collaborationist government was being established in the town to administer the southern half of France, but it is not apparent whether either Turroni's presence in the town or his arrest were in any way connected with these developments. He was imprisoned at Saint-Pierre till 29 July 1940, when he was transferred to the internment camp at Villemagne (Gard). It was probably at the end of August that he was moved again, this time to the collection camp for foreigners ("Centre de rassemblement des étrangers") at Remoulins. On 22 October 1940 he was moved to the Le Vernet concentration camp. Four days later, however, on 26 October 1940, he managed to escape, apparently in the course of another transfer.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{evidence}} regarding Brown’s pedophilia {{had been}} given at the committal hearing it had been ruled prejudicial at trial and therefore could not be put before the Supreme Court jury. The jury were unable to reach a decision on the strong but circumstantial evidence. Trial was set for 25 July 2000 where the defense argued Brown was unfit to plead and a new trial was set for 31 July but before it could start newspapers reported that [...] "the <b>case</b> did <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> for legal reasons which cannot be published". The court suppressed release of the legal reasons until July 2001. In 2001 {{it was revealed that}} Brown's lawyer had applied for a section 613 verdict (unfit to be tried) from the jury. The jury had rejected the application, but in the meantime Brown's wife Charlotte had referred the case to the Queensland Mental Health Tribunal who ruled that Brown had progressive dementia and was also suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and was thus unfit to stand trial. The Attorney-General lodged an appeal and the court concluded that the Mental Health Tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to overrule the jury and commissioned an independent psychiatric report. In July 2001 the report concluded that Brown was unfit to stand trial because he was suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Although the psychiatric report could not overrule the courts finding that the trial could proceed, Queensland's Director of Public Prosecutions, Leanne Clare, announced on 3 July that her office had decided <b>not</b> to <b>proceed</b> with the retrial and all charges against Brown were dropped.|$|R

[...] Canterbury sued for malpractice on the grounds of negligence. [...] He was discharged from the hospital three and a half months later, his legs partly paralyzed. [...] During the 1968 trial, the defense argued that since Canterbury lacked expert testimony, the <b>case</b> could <b>not</b> <b>proceed.</b> This lack of testimony was likely the result of a [...] "conspiracy of silence" [...] that, at the time, prevented doctors from testifying against one another. Judge Spottswood W. Robinson III of the DC Circuit Court allowed the case to go to a jury, deciding both that an expert was not necessary in such cases and that the standard for informed consent was what a reasonable patient would want to know in rendering a decision. [...] At the second trial, Dr. Spence acknowledged that he had told Canterbury and his mother only that the surgery might result in “weakness" [...] without mentioning paralysis, and that he avoided a more specific warning so as not to deter the patient from pursuing the operation. Nevertheless, the jury ruled against Canterbury.|$|R
50|$|Felton and Barry met on 28 August 1920 {{over the}} full {{course on the}} Parramatta and for a stake of £500 a side. A crowd {{estimated}} between one hundred and {{one hundred and fifty}} thousand persons lined all vantage points to see the first Championship race held in Sydney since 1907. A number were also on board steamers that followed the race. Unfortunately the race did not live up to expectations. Felton led for the first mile and a half and then Barry fouled him. Both men appealed to the umpire. Felton stopped rowing believing he had won on the foul but the umpire, Bill Beach ordered the men to continue rather than making a ruling. He later said that they were in neutral water and the foul in no way affected the result of the race. It was likely he believed the foul was accidental as an intentional foul would have cost the perpetrator the race. The umpire's decision was final. Felton did not continue to scull on at speed but Barry did and he crossed the line about twelve lengths ahead and thus regained the World Title. His time was 24m.32s. Felton’s trainer was Richard Arnst, a former world champion, who believed his man should have got the decision as be believed that Barry had intentionally fouled Felton. Felton accused Beach of partiality and applied for a Supreme Court injunction to stop the stake money being paid to Barry. Felton was desirous of a re-match for the money only rather than the money and the title but eventually he withdrew his claim so the <b>case</b> did <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> and Barry received his cash.|$|R
40|$|Eight {{cases of}} a {{histological}} entity that we name &#x 2032;acute eosinophilic appendicitis&#x 2032; (AEA) are described and compared with classical acute appendicitis and appendices, {{which turned out}} to be normal after emergency appendicectomy. These 8 cases formed part of a dataset of 128 emergency appendicectomies, which also included 78 cases of classical acute appendicitis and 42 cases of normal appendix. The clinical and pathological variables were compared between these three. Acute eosinophilic appendicitis is characterized by acute presentation and a grossly inflamed appendix, but with absence of neutrophils in the muscle layer. The histological hallmark of the entity is eosinophil infiltration of the muscularis propria with accompanying edema separating muscle fibers (the Eosinophil - Edema lesion). The duration and prevalence of symptoms, the male female ratio and the gross maximum circumference of the appendix in these 8 cases resembled classical acute appendicitis rather than those cases in which the morphology of the appendix was normal. The Eosinophil-Edema lesion was also seen in many cases of classical appendicitis in non-suppurative areas where neutrophils were sparse or absent. We hypothesize that this lesion is an allergic response and is probably an early event in the evolution of acute phlegmonous appendicitis. Acute eosinophilic appendicitis may merely be those <b>cases</b> that do <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> on to suppuration...|$|R

To {{study in}} vivo {{the role of}} the ubiquitin-like protein Smt 3 (Sumo) during Drosophila development, we {{generated}} transgenic flies carrying the transgene UAS-smt 3 i to reduce smt 3 mRNA levels in specific groups of cells. Low smt 3 in the prothoracic gland prevents metamorphosis. RNAi knockdown larvae stop their development in their last larval stage and remain alive for up to a month, during which they continue to eat and gain weight. Their prothoracic glands have fewer, but larger cells than normal. They also have lower ecdysteroid titre than WT. After dietary administration of exogenous ecdysone these larvae form pupal <b>cases,</b> but do <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> further in development and die. We observed that, in larvae with lower levels of smt 3, the subcellular localization and expression levels of factors involved in the regulation of ecdysteroids synthesis, are altered. These results are in concordance to larvae mutant in lesswright, the homologue of the Sumo conjugating enzyme gene Ubc 9. Interestingly, prothoracic gland cells present reduced intracellular channels and a reduced content in lipid droplets and cholesterol, which could contribute to the deficit in steroidogenesis.

This retrospective study of patients who underwent laparotomy for suspected acute appendicitis was undertaken to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound in diagnosing acute appendicitis and the frequency of leucocytosis in patients in whom the diagnosis was confirmed by histology. The ultrasound and surgery registers were reviewed to identify 254 referrals for abdominal ultrasound between January 2001 and December 2002 because of a clinical suspicion of acute appendicitis.

In these patients, positive ultrasound and leucocytosis were present in five (29 %) and nine (53 %) respectively. Ultrasound showed 92 % specificity and 29 % sensitivity for the pre-operative diagnosis of appendicitis.
