5|$|Bath Township {{is a small}} {{community}} located ten miles (16km) northeast of Lansing, Michigan which contains the unincorporated village of Bath. The area was primarily agricultural in the early 1920s. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, many small one-room schools were closed, where different grades shared the same classroom and teacher. Educators of the era believed that children would receive a better and more complete education if students could attend a single school at one location. The grades could be age-divided into classes, and the facilities <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> a higher quality.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Nazi–Soviet pact on 23 August 1939, the RAF mobilised. Cunningham had been test-flying the airliner de Havilland Dragon. Only 16 were complete before the declaration of war in September. The growing tension in Europe made war more likely. John was forced to commit himself either to de Havilland or the RAF at this juncture. The RAF had trained him and he felt he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> far more use in the RAF than test-flying aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The pre-dreadnought's {{armament}} {{was completed}} by a tertiary battery of light, rapid-fire guns. These <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> any calibre from 3-inch (76mm) down to machine guns. Their role was to give short-range protection against torpedo boats, or to rake the deck and superstructure of a battleship.|$|E

It now includes a modern brick chimney stack.). The priests' vestry in turn leads to the later nineteenth century choir sacristy or vestry. This is a slight lean-to structure, with timber glazing to the roof in two levels, and is built, none too elegantly, between {{the east end of}} the north transept and the original priests' vestry.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the portraits on the Makkotai coins are {{that they do not}} have {{identical}} head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they all have the same written legend. Such an observation has been made of coins assigned to the Western Kshatrapas of Gujarat, which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera coins. Scholars who analyzed the varying portraiture on the Kshatrapa coins have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the coins <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their coins or the coins all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his different ages. Based on such theories, the Chera coins could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigation}} of Olmec basalt workshops {{suggest that the}} colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away {{both large and small}} flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> the same basalt as the monument itself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo, indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses. Monument20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed on the weather forecast and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> great importance, especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, the use {{of horse}} and buggy {{had fallen out of}} fashion, and the Burnside Fountain saw little use in its {{intended}} purpose. By 1939 citizens of Worcester were already calling for the fountain to be moved to a more suitable place where it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> more use. It took until 1969 for the Burnside Fountain to be moved from Central Square. It was relocated to the Worcester Common and turned to face Salem Square. One year later, in May 1970, the statue was ripped from its pedestal and stolen. It was returned later that same year, but it took until 1972 for the boy and turtle to be placed back on top of the basin. Another apparent theft attempt happened in 2004 when the bronze sculpture was toppled off its pedestal and left dangling off the basin. The city was quick to fix the statue this time, with it being righted and reattached within days.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated at the competition's outcome, Leech on June 11, 1891 {{instructed}} Barber {{to prepare}} {{designs for the}} half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided to leave that design unaltered for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was {{to be done at}} the Mint; the chief engraver replied that he was aware of no one who <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> help in the preparation of new designs. Leech had spoken with Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.|$|E

5|$|Players {{control the}} player {{character}} Kid Klown as {{he attempts to}} rescue Princess Honey from the villain Black Jack. The game's graphics are presented in an isometric view as Kid Klown automatically moves down a path to thwart Black Jack's plans of blowing up one of his spade bombs in each level. Various obstacles cause Kid Klown to slow down if they collide with him; if Kid Klown {{does not make it}} to the bomb in time or if he is hit too many times, the level is lost. The game consists of 5 stages. In each stage, Kid Klown must find all 4 card suit orbs and stop the bomb to complete the level. At the end of each stage Kid Klown gets a key which in turn at the ending <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> use to unlock Honey's cage. If the player gets all 4 orbs in the very first turn, Kid Klown also gets a Honey heart. After the fifth stage Kid Klown must find the correct lock out of the 10 locks to unlock Honey's cage.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra {{began to}} lose {{political}} power from this point. The decree of Mariano Moreno that changed the military promotions, which was never derogated, began to bear fruit, even if Moreno {{was not in the}} Junta anymore. The army became more professional, and less based on militias. Many of the new military authorities opposed Saavedra. The political crisis increased with the unfavourable military outcomes of the war: Belgrano was defeated at the Paraguay campaign, Castelli at the Upper Peru campaign, and the capture of Montevideo became increasingly difficult with the intervention of Portuguese troops supporting it. The many members of the Junta made the internal work difficult, as all measures were discussed by all members, hindering the swift reactions needed by the war. Saavedra left Buenos Aires at this point, and headed to the Upper Peru, to take command of the Army of the North. He thought that he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> greater help as a military leader than facing the political struggles of Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|The usual grave for a thrall was {{probably}} {{not much more than}} a hole in the ground. He {{was probably}} buried in such a way as to ensure both that he did not return to haunt his masters and that he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> use to his masters after they died. Slaves were sometimes sacrificed to be useful in the next life. A free man was usually given weapons and equipment for riding. An artisan, such as a blacksmith, could receive his entire set of tools. Women were provided with their jewelry and often with tools for female and household activities. The most sumptuous Viking funeral discovered so far is the Oseberg Ship burial, which was for a woman (probably a queen or a priestess) who lived in the 9th century.|$|E

5|$|While {{eight of}} the Nine Ministers <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>of</b> {{commoner}} origin, the post of Minister of the Imperial Clan (Zongzheng 宗正), {{also known as the}} Director of the Imperial Clan, was always occupied {{by a member of the}} imperial family. He oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles. His ministry was responsible for record-keeping of all nobles, a register being updated at the beginning of each year. When a serious infraction was committed by a member of the imperial family, the Minister of the Imperial Clan was the first high official to be notified before the emperor, who made the ultimate decision about any possible legal action. This minister's subordinates heard grievances of imperial family members and informed them about new ordinances. Unlike kings and marquesses, who were not responsible to any of the Nine Ministers, imperial princesses and their fiefs were kept under surveillance by the Minister of the Imperial Clan.|$|E
