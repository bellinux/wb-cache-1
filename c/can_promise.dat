500|$|Asked if {{he thought}} Bowyer could still win the {{championship}} after this setback, Stewart argued, [...] "It's possible for sure. The biggest {{thing is going to}} be going to the race track and having that stress of not having his crew chief, not having his car chief and those are two key people on a race weekend... I <b>can</b> <b>promise</b> you that Childress has the resources to cover this... it's definitely possible, but everyone else {{is going to have to}} have trouble." [...] Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton commented, [...] "We don't consider taking away the win. If you ask some, they would consider a 150-point penalty with only nine races to go in the Chase a pretty hefty penalty." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week before}} the final Cardiff played Ipswich Town in the 2011–12 Football League Championship – it was their last match before the final, which they lost 3–0. Cardiff had a few injury {{concerns}} ahead of the final. Captain Mark Hudson had a calf problem, while midfielder Stephen McPhail had missed Cardiff's last four matches as {{he was suffering from}} Sjögren's syndrome, an immune system disorder. Goalkeeper Heaton was also a doubt with a knock on his ankle, but he was considered likely to start the match. Cardiff manager Malky Mackay acknowledged that Liverpool went into the match as favourites, but he was confident his team could provide a shock: [...] "Obviously we are underdogs but we have a chance in the final, Maybe only a one in 10 chance but that's still a chance if you turn up motivated, fit and organised and I think I <b>can</b> <b>promise</b> that." ...|$|E
500|$|Tony Blair {{recorded}} his {{part for the}} episode in April 2003, in ten minutes at Downing Street. Blair was sent the script {{early on in the}} writing process, and it took eight months of negotiation between Fox and Blair's director of communications Alastair Campbell before Blair could appear as a guest star. In the original script, Blair was supposed to welcome the Simpsons to the United Kingdom [...] "with a garland of 'genuine Newcastle coal' and hand [...] a complimentary Corgi", but Campbell had them changed, as Blair [...] "made it very clear that he was only interested in doing the show if he could promote tourism in Britain". The show's staff did not know whether Blair would actually record his lines until showrunner Al Jean and his wife were in London promoting the 300th episode of The Simpsons. They received a call stating: [...] "If you go over to Downing Street tomorrow and <b>can</b> <b>promise</b> to get the recording done in 15 minutes, then the Prime Minister will do it". Jean was [...] "so nervous, it was ridiculous" [...] when he met Blair, an event he has cited as [...] "one of the most fantastic moments of his life". Blair was the top choice to guest star in the episode, but the staff did not think they {{had a chance to get}} him to appear. Blair is the only head of government to guest star in the show, with Rudy Giuliani (who played himself in the episode [...] "Stop! Or My Dog Will Shoot") the only other politician to guest star.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order for}} a company to grow its business, it often must raise money - for example, to finance an acquisition; to buy {{equipment}} or land; or to invest in new product development.

2500|$|The {{original}} soundtrack {{was released}} by Atlantic Records and Warner Music Nashville on September 27, 2011. It includes eight new songs and four remakes of songs from the original film's soundtrack. Brewer said, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>promise</b> Footloose fans that I will be true {{to the spirit of}} the original film. But I still gotta put my own Southern grit into it and kick it into 2011." [...] Kenny Loggins' [...] "Footloose" [...] was covered by Blake Shelton for the remake, which is an upbeat country version. The film opens with several teens dancing to Loggins' original version of the song. Like the original film, the 2011 version also features [...] "Bang Your Head (Metal Health)" [...] by the heavy metal band Quiet Riot and [...] "Let's Hear It for the Boy" [...] by Deniece Williams.|$|E

I've done that in the High Arctic of Canada on Devon Island and more recently in the Utah desert, where I was the Station Commander for two weeks.” He said that “For thirty years we've waited to carry space exploration forward. We're in a transition zone, what I like to call 'Standing on Columbus' dock.'...Today we are called by adventure to another land....It's OUR new land, a new frontier. We're going to Mars....But when?...More practically, we're going within 20 years. Some of you could be walking on Mars before you are forty years old. You just have to believe.

2500|$|Douglas Jerrold's Weekly Newspaper wrote [...] "Wuthering Heights is {{a strange}} sort of book,—baffling all regular criticism; yet, it is {{impossible}} to begin and not finish it; and quite as impossible to lay it aside afterwards and say nothing about. In Wuthering Heights the reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance, and anon come passages of powerful testimony to the supreme power of love– even over demons in the human form. The women in the book are of a strange fiendish-angelic nature, tantalising, and terrible, and the men are indescribable out of the book itself. Yet, towards the close of the story occurs the following pretty, soft picture, which comes like the rainbow after a storm... We strongly recommend all our readers who love novelty to get this story, for we <b>can</b> <b>promise</b> them that they never have read anything like it before. It is very puzzling and very interesting, and if we had space we would willingly devote a little more time to the analysis of this remarkable story, but we must leave it to our readers to decide what sort of book it is." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} two questions. First <b>can</b> {{a binding}} <b>promise</b> conflict with other binding promises and thereby generate conflicting obligations? Second <b>can</b> binding <b>promises</b> conflict with other non-promissory obligations, {{so that we}} are obliged to keep so-called ‘wicked promises’? The answer to both questions is ‘yes’. The discussion examines both ‘natural right’ and ‘social practice’ approaches to promissory obligation and I conclude that neither can explain why we should be unable to make binding promises that conflict with our prior obligations. There is also consideration of the parallel case of ‘wicked commands’...|$|R
