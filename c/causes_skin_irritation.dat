25|$|In some cases, an {{excessive}} use of perfumes may cause allergic reactions of the skin. For instance, acetophenone, ethyl acetate and acetone while present in many perfumes, are also known or potential respiratory allergens. Nevertheless, this may be misleading, since the harm presented by many of these chemicals (either natural or synthetic) is dependent on environmental conditions and their concentrations in a perfume. For instance, linalool, which is listed as an irritant, <b>causes</b> <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> when it degrades to peroxides, however the use of antioxidants in perfumes or reduction in concentrations can prevent this. As well, the furanocoumarin present in natural extracts of grapefruit or celery can cause severe allergic reactions and increase sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation.|$|E

40|$|Chirality plays a {{vital role}} in {{biological}} membranes and has a significant effect depending on the type and arrangement of the isomer. Menthol has two typical chiral forms, d- and l-, which exhibit different behaviours. l-Menthol is known for its physiological effect on sensitivity (i. e. a cooling effect), whereas d-menthol <b>causes</b> <b>skin</b> <b>irritation.</b> Menthol molecules may affect not only the thermoreceptors on biomembranes, but also the membrane itself. Membrane heterogeneity (lipid rafts, phase separation) depends on lipid packing and acyl chain ordering. Our interest is to elaborate the chirality dependence of d- and l-menthol on membrane heterogeneity. We revealed physical differences between the two optical isomers of menthol on membrane heterogeneity by studying model membranes using nuclear magnetic resonance and microscopic observation...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} role of topical valproate (VPA) in hair regrowth {{has been}} recently suggested. However, safety reports of VPA as a topical formulation are lacking. Therefore, {{in the present}} study, we investigated whether VPA <b>causes</b> <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> in humans. We first performed a cell viability test and showed that VPA did not exhibit toxicity toward HaCaT keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and RBL- 3 H mast cells. We then performed clinical patch test and skin irritation test through transdermal drug delivery {{with the help of}} microneedle rollers. No significant findings were obtained in the clinical patch test. In the skin irritation test, only 1 patient showed erythema at 1 hr, but the irritation reaction faded away within a few hours. Erythema and edema were not observed at 24 hr. We concluded that VPA has minimal potential to elicit skin irritation. Therefore, we consider that VPA can safely be applied to human skin.

40|$|Electroencephalography (EEG) is a {{procedure}} that records brain activity in a non-invasive manner. The cost and size of EEG devices has decreased in recent years, facilitating a growing interest in wearable EEG {{that can be used}} out-of-the-lab {{for a wide range of}} applications, from epilepsy diagnosis, to stroke rehabilitation, to Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). A major obstacle for these emerging applications is the wet electrodes, which are used as part of the EEG setup. These electrodes are attached to the human scalp using a conductive gel, which can be uncomfortable to the subject, <b>causes</b> <b>skin</b> <b>irritation,</b> and some gels have poor long-term stability. A solution to this problem is to use dry electrodes, which do not require conductive gel, but tend to have a higher noise floor. This paper presents a novel methodology for the design and manufacture of such dry electrodes. We manufacture the electrodes using low cost desktop 3 D printers and off-the-shelf components for the first time. This allows quick and inexpensive electrode manufacturing and opens the possibility of creating electrodes that are customized for each individual user. Our 3 D printed electrodes are compared against standard wet electrodes, and the performance of the proposed electrodes is suitable for BCI applications, despite the presence of additional noise...|$|E
40|$|Solvents are {{primarily}} used for making protective coatings. Considering their chemical nature, {{there are a}} great variety of coatings, including those based on liquid hydrocarbons and organic chloroderivatives. These products are a serious load to the environment because of their physicochemical properties, therefore, they have for some time been replaced with more-environmentally friendly, new generation products. One of them is the hydroxyester HE- 1 : made from isobutyric aldehyde condensation products, it is an alternative to those coalescents for paints and varnishes which are intended to be replaced or their use restricted. The results of selected toxicological tests relating to the human health risk effect of the hydroxyester HE- 1 – environmentally-friendly additive to paints and varnishes are presented. The test results indicate that HE- 1 <b>causes</b> <b>skin</b> <b>irritation</b> in rabbit only when used at its maximum concentrations. No lesions in the cornea or iris were observed in any of the test rabbits after the application of the hydroxyester HE- 1. In the mutagenic effect test of HE- 1 on the bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, the result was negative. Based on the test results, {{it was found that the}} hydroxyester HE- 1 may only have a human health risk effect when used at its maximum concentrations...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundOral {{isotretinoin}} (ISO) is {{the only}} drug which promotes prolonged remission or cure of severe acne. It also has other properties, supporting its use for non-acne indications. Retinoic acid (RA) is gold standard treatment for photoaging. ISO for photoaging treatment was reported in non-controlled trials as alternative to RA, which <b>causes</b> <b>skin</b> <b>irritation.</b> ObjectiveTo compare clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical effects of low-dose ISO and 0. 05 % topical RA to treat photoaging. MethodsRandomized, comparative, evaluator-blinded, single-center study. Twenty-four healthy, Caucasian, 50 to 75 -year-old men and women (menopausal or sterilized) with advanced photoaging were included. Twelve subjects received ISO, 20 mg/day, and 12 subjects were treated with RA cream, for six months; both treatments were administered every other day, and moisturizer and sunscreen were also used. Outcome measures included patient assessments, blinded photographic evaluations, Life Quality Index, histological (HE, Verhoeff) and immunohistochemical (p 53, collagen type I) evaluations, adverse events, liver function, lipid profile, and blood count. Statistical analysis with generalized estimating equations and repeated measures ANOVA tests was used. ResultsEleven subjects in each group completed the study. Patient and photographic assessments showed overall improvement in skin appearance. Quality-of-life scores were reduced for all subjects. Histological analysis revealed corneal layer diminution, epidermal thickness increase, and elastosis reduction. Immunohistochemical findings revealed significant epidermal p 53 reduction and dermal collagen 1 increase. No {{differences were found between}} groups; laboratory tests showed no significant alterations. ConclusionDespite being safe and effective, low-dose ISO was not superior to 0. 05 % RA for advanced photoaging treatment.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} model predicted that 1 -BP was {{absorbed by the}} skin. Additionally, there was an in vitro dermal penetration study identified that indicates that 1 -BP {{has the potential for}} substantial dermal penetration dependent on type and duration of exposure [Frasch et al. 2011]. A review of the available literature indicates that 1 -BP is capable of inducing a wide array of adverse systemic health effects, including neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, hematotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and developmental toxicity, regardless of exposure route [ClinTrials Bioresearch 1997; Zhao et al. 1999; Ichihara et al. 2000 a, 2000 b; WIL Research Laboratory 2001; Wang et al. 2002, 2003; Lee et al. 2005, 2007; Banu et al. 2007; Fueta et al. 2007]. Although the exact systemic hazards associated with skin contact and absorption of 1 -BP are unknown, 1 -BP is assigned the SK: SYS notation; this notation is based on the recognition of adverse health effects in test animals exposed via the inhalation, oral, and subcutaneous injection routes. Although a study using the EpiDerm human reconstructed epidermis model [Frasch et al. 2011] indicated that 1 -BP is not corrosive to the skin following exposure to 1 -BP, two in vivo tests, conducted with standard methods [Jacobs et al. 1987; P 1 lovics 2004], provide sufficient evidence that 1 -BP is irritating to the skin of rabbits. Although no human patch tests that evaluated the sensitization potential of 1 -BP were identified, one guinea pig maximization test [Elf Atochem 1995 b] showed that the substance is not a skin sensitizer. Therefore, {{on the basis of this}} assessment, 1 -BP is assigned the composite skin notation SK: SYS-DIR (IRR). Table 3 summarizes the skin designations for 1 -BP from NIOSH and other organizations. The equivalent skin designation for 1 -BP from the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling is Reproductive Category 1 B (Presumed human reproductive toxicant) and Skin Irritation Category 2 (<b>Causes</b> <b>skin</b> <b>irritation)</b> [European Parliament 2008].
