60|$|The {{track was}} rough and fresh gravel rolled under his feet. Now {{and then he}} struck a <b>cross-tie</b> and nearly fell.

6000|$|Halleck woke {{at daybreak}} from the drowse {{into which he}} had fallen. The train was {{creeping}} slowly over the track, feeling its way, and he heard fragments of talk among the passengers about a broken rail that the conductor had been warned of. He turned to ask some question, when the pull of rising speed came from the locomotive, {{and at the same}} moment the car stopped with a jolting pitch. It settled upon the track again; but the two cars in front were overturned, and the passengers were still climbing from their windows, when Halleck got his bewildered party to the ground. Children were crying, and a woman was led by with her face cut and bleeding from the broken glass; but it was reported that no one else was hurt, and the trainmen gave their helplessness to the inspection of the rotten <b>cross-tie</b> that had caused the accident. One of the passengers kicked the decayed wood with his boot. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I always like a little accident like this, early; it makes us safe the rest of the day." [...] The sentiment apparently commended itself to popular acceptance; Halleck went forward with part of the crowd to see what was the matter with the locomotive: it had kept the track, but seemed to be injured somehow; the engineer was working at it, hammer in hand; he exchanged some dry pleasantries with a passenger who asked him if there was any chance of hiring a real fast ox-team in that neighborhood, in case a man was {{in a hurry to get}} on to Tecumseh.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{behaviour}} {{of cable}} networks is {{highly dependent on}} the installation location, stiffness, and damping of cross-ties. Thus, these are the important design parameters for a cable network. While {{the effects of the}} former two on the network response have been investigated to some extent in the past, the impact of <b>cross-tie</b> damping has rarely been addressed. To comprehend our knowledge of mechanics associated with cable networks, in the current study, an analytical model of a cable network will be proposed by taking into account both <b>cross-tie</b> stiffness and damping. In addition, the damping property of main cables in the network will also be considered in the formulation. This would allow exploring not only the effectiveness of a <b>cross-tie</b> design on enhancing the in-plane stiffness of a constituted cable network, but also its energy dissipation capacity. The proposed analytical model will be applied to networks with different configurations. The influence of <b>cross-tie</b> stiffness and damping on the modal response of various types of networks will be investigated by using the corresponding undamped rigid <b>cross-tie</b> network as a reference base. Results will provide valuable information on the selection of <b>cross-tie</b> properties to achieve more effective cable vibration control...|$|E

40|$|A short {{computer}} program, fully documented, is presented, for the step-by-step {{dynamic analysis}} of isolated cables or couples of parallel cables of a cable-stayed bridge, connected {{to each other}} and possibly with the deck of the bridge, by very thin pretensioned wires (<b>cross-ties)</b> and subjected to variation of their axial forces due to traffic or to successive pulses of a wind drag force. A simplified SDOF model, approximating the fundamental vibration mode, is adopted for every individual cable. The geometric nonlinearity of the cables is taken into account by their geometric stiffness, whereas the material nonlinearities of the <b>cross-ties</b> include compressive loosening, tensile yielding, and hysteresis stress-strain loops. Seven numerical experiments are performed. Based on them, it is observed that if two interconnected parallel cables have different dynamic characteristics, for example different lengths, thus different masses, weights, and geometric stiffnesses, too, or if one of them has a small additional mass, then a single pretensioned very thin wire, connecting them {{to each other and}} possibly with the deck of the bridge, proves effective in suppressing, by its hysteresis damping, the vibrations of the cables...|$|R
40|$|Neel {{walls and}} <b>cross-tie</b> walls are two {{structures}} commonly seen in ferromagnetic thin films. They are interesting because their internal length scales are not determined by dimensional analysis alone. This paper studies (a) the repulsive interaction of one-dimensional Neel walls and (b) the internal length {{scale of the}} <b>cross-tie</b> wall. Our analysis of (a) is mathematically rigorous; it provides, roughly speaking, the first two terms of an asymptotic expansion for the energy {{of a pair of}} interacting walls. Our analysis of (b) is heuristic, since it rests on an analogy between the <b>cross-tie</b> wall and an ensemble of Neel walls. This analogy, combined with our results on Neel walls and a judicious choice of parameter regime, yields a specific prediction for the internal length scale of a <b>cross-tie</b> wall.

40|$|Abstract. Using the Gauss-Seidel {{projection}} method {{developed in}} [4] and [17], we simulate the three dimensional domain wall structures for thin films at various thickness. We observe transition from Néel wall to <b>cross-tie</b> wall and to Bloch wall as the thickness is increased. Periodic structures for <b>cross-tie</b> wall are also studied. The {{results are in}} good agreement with the experimental observations. Hysteresis loops are calculated for samples of various sizes. In particular, we study the effect of <b>cross-tie</b> wall in the switching process. These simulations have demonstrated high efficiency of the Gauss-Seidel projection method. 1. Introduction.

40|$|<b>Cross-ties</b> {{are often}} used on {{cable-stayed}} bridges for mitigating wind-induced stay vibration since they can be easily installed on existing systems. The system obtained by connecting two (or more) stays with a transverse restrainer is designated as an “in-plane cable-network”. Failures in the restrainers of an existing network have been observed. In a previous study [1] a model was proposed to explain the failures in the <b>cross-ties</b> as being related to a loss in the initial pre-tensioning force imparted to the connector. This effect leads to the “unilateral” free vibration of the network. Deterministic free vibrations of a three-cable network were investigated by using the “equivalent linearization method”. Since {{the value of the}} initial vibration amplitude is often not well known due to the complex aeroelastic vibration regimes, which can be experienced by the stays, the stochastic nature of the problem must be considered. This issue is investigated in the present paper. Free-vibration dynamics of the cable network, driven by an initial stochastic disturbance associated with uncertain vibration amplitudes, is examined. The corresponding random eigen-value problem for the vibration frequencies is solved through an implementation of Stochastic Approximation, (SA) based on the Robbins–Monro Theorem. Monte-Carlo methods are also used for validating the SA results...|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{behavior}} of large low-rise buildings with rigid walls and flexible diaphragms will be dominated {{more by the}} diaphragm’s seismic response than by the very stiff vertical walls. For practitioners, estimating the stiffness of large flexible diaphragms is important for computing building setbacks from property lines and adjacent structures as well as evaluating structural integrity under seismic loads. In addition, researchers attempting to accurately model a building’s dynamic behavior need to assemble an accurate diaphragm stiffness prediction. The traditional diaphragm chord model consists of a single continuous line of axial resistance at the diaphragm boundaries; however, as this paper will demonstrate a collective series of structural members distributed across the diaphragm will function intentionally or unintentionally as a collective chord, adding significant flexural stiffness and reducing chord forces. In seismically active areas, masonry and concrete wall anchorage forces utilize code-mandated continuous <b>cross-ties</b> within the diaphragm, and often these <b>cross-ties</b> are sufficiently strong and stiff to unintentionally develop collective chord behavior whether in steel or in wood diaphragm systems. While neglecting this embedded collective chord behavior results in conservative chord and diaphragm drift designs, researchers or practitioners trying to predict seismic response of these buildings will potentially underestimate the true seismic response...|$|R
