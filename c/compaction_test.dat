50|$|The Proctor <b>compaction</b> <b>test</b> is a {{laboratory}} method of experimentally determining the optimal moisture content {{at which a}} given soil type will become most dense and achieve its maximum dry density. The term Proctor is in honor of R. R. Proctor, who in 1933 showed that the dry density of a soil for a given compactive effort depends {{on the amount of}} water the soil contains during soil compaction. His original test is most commonly referred to as the standard Proctor compaction test; later on, his test was updated to create the modified Proctor <b>compaction</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

A detailed derivation of improved expressions for determining the field compaction parameters is presented.

50|$|In 1958, the {{modified}} Proctor <b>compaction</b> <b>test</b> was developed as an ASTM standard. A higher and more relevant compaction standard was necessary. There were larger and heavier compaction equipment, like large vibratory compactors and heavier steel-face rollers. This equipment could produce higher dry densities in soils along with greater stability. These improved properties {{allowed for the}} transport of far heavier truck loads over roads and highways. During the 1970s and early 1980s {{the modified}} Proctor test became more widely used as a modern replacement for the standard Proctor test.|$|E
5000|$|The {{soil type}} - that is, grain-size distributions, {{shape of the}} soil grains, {{specific}} gravity of soil solids, and amount and type of clay minerals, present - has a great influence on the maximum dry unit weight and optimum moisture content. [...] It also has a great influence on how the materials should be compacted in given situations. Compaction is accomplished by use of heavy equipment. In sands and gravels, the equipment usually vibrates, to cause re-orientation of the soil particles into a denser configuration. In silts and clays, a sheepsfoot roller is frequently used, to create small zones of intense shearing, which drives {{air out of the}} soil. Determination of adequate compaction is done by determining the in-situ density of the soil and comparing it to the maximum density determined by a laboratory test. The most commonly used laboratory test is called the Proctor <b>compaction</b> <b>test</b> and there are two different methods in obtaining the maximum density. They are the standard Proctor and modified Proctor tests; the modified Proctor is more commonly used. For small dams, the standard Proctor may still be the reference.|$|E

50|$|Soil compactors {{are used}} to perform test methods which cover {{laboratory}} compaction methods {{used to determine the}} relationship between molding water content and dry unit weight of soils. Soil placed as engineering fill is compacted to a dense state to obtain satisfactory engineering properties such as, shear strength, compressibility, or permeability. In addition, foundation soils are often compacted to improve their engineering properties. Laboratory <b>compaction</b> <b>tests</b> provide the basis for determining the percent compaction and molding water content needed to achieve the required engineering properties, and for controlling construction to assure that the required compaction and water contents are achieved.

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to develop a {{predictive}} model between gradational parameters, compaction energy (CE), and compaction characteristics, i. e. maximum dry unit weight (γdmax) and optimum moisture content (OMC) of sandy soils. For this purpose, 110 sandy soil samples, representing a wide range of grain size distribution (GSD), were selected. Besides the classification tests, standard and modified Proctor <b>compaction</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on selected samples. Based on the test results, the soils used in the study are classified into various groups of medium to fine sand with gravel content not exceeding 5 % and nonplastic fines within 45 %. Multiple regression analyses were carried out on the experimental data and a predictive model was developed to express compaction parameters (γdmax and OMC) in terms of two variables, namely, uniformity coefficient (Cᵤ) and CE. Following the development of predictive correlations based on the 110 samples, a new set of 40 sandy soil samples were selected and their compaction results were used to validate the proposed two predictive equations. The results showed that variation between experimental and predicted values of maximum dry unit weight (γdmax) is within the ± 5 % confidence interval and that of the OMC (%) is within ± 3. 0 %. The two equations are also presented graphically for standard and modified Proctor compaction energies that are used commonly in <b>compaction</b> <b>tests.</b> The proposed correlations and the predictive curves would be very useful in geotechnical engineering for quick estimation of cdmax and OMC without performing the laboratory <b>compaction</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the typical}} {{conventional}} fill compaction, the dry density ρd {{and the water}} content w are controlled in relation to (ρd) max and wopt determined by laboratory <b>compaction</b> <b>tests</b> using a representative sample at a certain compaction energy level CEL. Although CEL and actual soil type affect significantly the values of (ρd) max and wopt, they change inevitably in a given earthwork project while CEL in the field may not match the value used in the laboratory <b>compaction</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>Compaction</b> control based on the stiffness of compacted soil in the field has such a drawback that the stiffness drops upon wetting more largely as the degree of saturation, Sr, of compacted soil becomes lower than the optimum degree of saturation (Sr) opt defined as Sr when (ρd) max is obtained for a given CEL. In comparison, the value of (Sr) opt and the ρd/(ρd) max vs. Sr - (Sr) opt relation of compacted soil are rather insensitive to variations in CEL and soil type, while the strength and stiffness of unsoaked and soaked compacted soil is controlled by ρd and “Sr {{at the end of}} compaction”. It is proposed to control not only w and ρd but also Sr so that Sr becomes (Sr) opt and ρd becomes large enough to ensue soil properties required in design...|$|R

40|$|As {{granular}} soils may be compressible or have inadequate strength, compaction {{is particularly}} useful when soils {{are subjected to}} dynamic loading or cyclic loading. A new laboratory apparatus for investigating dynamic compaction has been designed and fabricated. The basic principle of this new technique is to introduce vibrations during the expansion process in static compaction grouting. In these tests, the injection pressure, the excess pore water pressure, and the change in void ratio of the specimens are measured. The main focus is to investigate {{the development of the}} injection pressure, the void ratio, and the excess pore water pressure due to dynamic compaction and the subsequent consolidation of the soils. In addition, the relative density of the soils is used to evaluate the dynamic compaction efficiency. Scaled laboratory experiments are conducted to study the effect of this dynamic compaction frequency on compaction efficiency. The experimental results show that the change in void ratio in the dynamic <b>compaction</b> <b>tests</b> is about four times greater than that in the static <b>compaction</b> <b>tests.</b> Dynamic <b>compaction</b> frequency {{plays an important role in}} soil densification due to dynamic compaction...|$|R

40|$|Fills {{consisting}} of rock or soils with high stone and boulder proportions {{are also used}} {{for the construction of}} traffic embankments. In the case of these filling materials, the conventional methods for <b>compaction</b> <b>testing</b> can only be applied to a limited extent or in a modified way and at considerable expense. Thus, there is a direct need for a simple and rapid procedure which can be used in order to assess the compaction quality of such fills and, if possible, also improves the converage of the areas to be tested. The objective of the research project was to process the following questions: Can <b>compaction</b> <b>tests</b> be used in order to assess the compaction quality of fills {{consisting of}} rock or soils with high stone and boulder proportions by means of measurement of the settlement? Which electronic measuring systems available in geodesy today are most suitable for corresponding <b>compaction</b> <b>tests</b> and where are the limits of the application by means of measurement of the settlement? The filling materials under consideration were described and, {{on the basis of the}} grain-size disctributions, an attempt was made to characterise them with regard to the compaction properties. On the asusmption of a simple mathematical regularity for the description of the settlement course of a fill during the compaction, fundamental theoretical deliberations were made about the applicability of an existing criterion for the assessment of the compaction quality. A corresponding evaluation of the data from trial compaction fields carried out confirmed the theoretically derived connections. The applicability of various procedures for the geodetic settlement measurement was investigated. The possibilities of different modern geodetic measuring procedures for one-dimensional and three-dimensional point recording were portrayed and were assessed taking account of accuracy requirements, costs and economic viability. A suitable measuring and evaluation system was selected and was developed further until it was ready to be applied. (orig.)
