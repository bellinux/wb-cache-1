50|$|<b>Courre</b> Merlan (Whiting Chase) is an oil {{painting}} by French artist Jean Dubuffet. It {{has been part}} of the permanent collection of the Indianapolis Museum of Art since 1992.|$|E
50|$|The area {{is rich in}} game. Wild boar {{and deer}} are present in {{excellent}} areas for the chasse à <b>courre</b> (hunting with hounds) which {{is the reason for}} the chateau. Pigeons, thrushes, ortolans, and woodcocks were also highly sought after by the Duke.|$|E
5000|$|Dubuffet {{believed}} that art addressed {{itself to the}} mind and not the physical world. With works such as <b>Courre</b> Merlan that portray objects {{with little or no}} reference to their actual colors or dimensions, he intended to prove that the world within the painting might be just as real as the physical world. Dubuffet argued that individuals could create their own versions of reality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Courre</b> Merlan (Whiting Chase) appears abstract. It {{consists}} of a large free-form shape that nearly fills the canvas and is placed on a dark, textured background. This large shape contains smaller, neatly outlined, puzzle-like shapes, {{most of which are}} white and filled with parallel lines. The main colors in the work are limited to red, white, blue, and black. These features are all characteristic of Dubuffet's style at the time. Although the shapes are abstracted, a boat or ship and fishermen can be seen, and the title suggests they are fishing for whiting. In contrast with the foreground image, the background is dark and heavily textured with brushwork.|$|E
50|$|Throughout his career, Dubuffet {{created his}} works {{as parts of}} distinct, {{self-contained}} series or cycles. <b>Courre</b> Merlan {{was a part of}} his Hourloupe cycle, which was the longest-running series, from July 1962 to 1974. Paintings in the Hourloupe are marked by flattened shapes, delineated with dark or black outlines, and a mostly limited color palette--red, white, blue and black. Dubuffet was initially inspired by ballpoint pen doodles he created while talking on the telephone. He believed this style reflected the way objects are seen in the mind. In the Hourloupe series, Dubuffet also veered into three-dimensional sculptures and installations. The Hourloupe cycle, and this work, also reflect Dubuffet’s affinity for “art brut”—art produced by children, psychiatric patients, and other untrained artists. In addition, although Dubuffet did not consider himself a Surrealist, he was influenced by the surrealist interest in the unconscious.|$|E
50|$|A {{hypothesis}} {{about the}} origin of the verb harasser is harace/harache, which was used in the 14th century in expressions like <b>courre</b> à la harache (to pursue) and prendre aucun par la harache (to take somebody under constraint). The Französisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch, a German etymological dictionary of the French language (1922-2002) compares phonetically and syntactically both harace and harache to the interjection hare and haro by alleging a pejorative and augmentative form. The latter was an exclamation indicating distress and emergency (recorded since 1180) but is also reported later in 1529 in the expression crier haro sur (to arise indignation over somebody). hare 's use is already reported in 1204 as an order to finish public activities as fairs or markets and later (1377) still as command but referred to dogs. This dictionary suggests a relation of haro/hare with the old lower franconian *hara (here) (as by bringing a dog to heel).|$|E
50|$|The French Trotter excels at both ridden {{and driven}} {{trotting}} races, and maintains a particularly balanced and level stride. Once its racing career is over it is extensively {{used as a}} remount for the Hunts (chasse à <b>courre)</b> in France where substance and economics {{are more important than}} equestrianism or turn-out. Its stamina, sure footing, excellent carrying abilities and even character makes it the choice mount for stag, boar and roedeer hunting, although thoroughbreds and Selle Français may also be in use. French Trotters can also make good show-jumpers and many champions have French Trotter blood. Jappeloup, the Seoul individual olympic gold-medallist was got by a French Trotter stallion.Since the 70's an over-production of French Trotters has sent prices down. Considering that 60% of a given production does not qualify for the races, many horses become available for amateur riders or riding centers. A reformed 3 year old trotter broken-in to harness and saddle may be bought today for less than 1200 €.|$|E
