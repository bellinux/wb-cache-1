The author assessed the current status and possible scenarios of migration flows from China to Russia. On the example of the Jewish Autonomous Region, it is shown that the fluctuating scenario is to be accepted as the most possible. In the article, {{the dynamics}} of international labor migration in the southern Russian Far East subjects due to the distinct character of the <b>cross-border</b> <b>position</b> the Russian Far East and North-Eastern provinces of China are analyzed in depth. The author assessed the perception of international migration by the population of southern Russian Far East subjects on the content base analysis. It is emphasized that the continued involvement of labor immigrants has led to a decrease in the professional level {{of the population of the}} Russian regions, which is reflected at the background of the declining interest of Chinese migrants to work in the territory of Russia...|$|E
40|$|The current {{development}} of the European Union {{is based on the}} cohesion policy which focuses on the attenuation of regional disparities. For this purpose, the idea of growth poles emerged in Romania, and its role became more than familiar: the determination of an internal socio-economic cohesion. Polycentrism becomes a concept of territorial planning increasingly promoted. Development of growth poles aims to reduce the attraction force of large centres and to balance the location of activities generating functions across a territory. This was the idea that {{led to the formation of}} Iaşi Metropolitan Area, territorial unit that is intended to be the main regional centre of the North-East Region, thus polarizing the surrounding areas. Iaşi Growth Pole objectives are represented by economic competitiveness, the {{development of}} regional connectivity and the promotion of regional cooperation. One of the major assets of the growth pole in achieving these goals is the <b>cross-border</b> <b>position</b> near the eastern border of the European Union. This paper examines to what extent Iași Growth Pole can rise to the required standards, while the peripheral position seems to be rather a disadvantage and the uncertain functionality of the metropolitan area shows that the main problem remains the reduced economic competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{changes have}} profoundly {{modified}} the luxury sector considered a niche until recently. These changes have deeply affected {{the very essence}} of luxury said to be characterized by a balance between ethics and aesthetics. Luxury brands are losing on ethics mainly due to their recent acceptance of profitability criteria based on economic logics calling for enlarged production volumes and wider distribution. However, we argue such loss of ethics can be counterbalanced by an increase in aesthetics through ever-growing partnerships with the art world which structure Business & Art relationships. This re-balancing process has two main reasons. For one thing, luxury brands are increasingly part of large conglomerates while in the past they used to be family-based companies attached to their specific know-how. We claim this disconnect results in loss of ethics. For another thing, some brands can fully claim their closeness to the world of contemporary art which promotes values of borderlessness and no longer bans partnerships with business on principles of art for art’s sake. Conscious of their <b>cross-border</b> <b>position,</b> luxury brands {{can take advantage of the}} porosity between their sector and that of art to re-balance the loss in ethics by an increase in aesthetics. This would help redefine their core constituents, thus relying on a solid financial structure to support their strategy. These luxury brands undergo a full artification process that turns them into art subjects able to produce inaccessible, intermediary and accessible objects in the luxury sector...|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} brief review and {{analysis}} of recent trends in international financial integration. In particular, we highlight the asymmetric nature of financial globalization, with the scale of <b>cross-border</b> <b>positions</b> among the advanced economies growing more quickly than for emerging market economies and developing countries. We investigate the sources of this divergent pattern and discuss the factors that could shape financial globalization in the coming years. ...|$|R
40|$|Global gross {{capital flows}} remain well below their peak before the global {{financial}} crisis, which was reached {{after a period of}} unusual expansion. Much of the decline can be attributed to a reduced flow of lending by banks – particularly to, from and within the euro area – as banks have unwound many of the <b>cross-border</b> <b>positions</b> they built up before the crisis. Capital inflows to some economies, however, are now larger than they were before the crisis. the international regulatory response to the crisis aims to address some of the risks associated with increased capital flows, while maintaining the benefits of an integrated financial system...|$|R
40|$|European global banks intermediating US dollar {{funds are}} {{important}} in influencing credit conditions in the United States. US dollar-denominated assets of banks outside the US are comparable in size to the total assets of the US commercial bank sector, but the large gross <b>cross-border</b> <b>positions</b> are masked by the netting out of the gross assets and liabilities. As a consequence, current account imbalances {{do not reflect the}} influence of gross capital flows on US financial conditions.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{that began in}} the summer of 2007 caused notable changes in the composition of U. S. cross-border financial flows, especially in the fall of 2008, when the crisis intensified. This article documents three major channels through which financial flows and associated portfolio positions were affected: (1) “flight to safety” shifts away from riskier securities and toward investments in safe and liquid markets, particularly U. S. Treasury securities; (2) unusual flows through the banking system resulting from a shortage of dollar liquidity abroad and a breakdown in interbank markets; and (3) a pullback from <b>cross-border</b> <b>positions</b> during the crisis.

40|$|Individual banks differ {{substantially}} in their foreign operations. This paper introduces heterogeneous banks into a general equilibrium framework of banking across borders {{to explain the}} documented variation. While the model matches existing micro and macro evidence, novel and unexplored predictions of the theory are also strongly supported by the data: The efficiency of the least efficient bank active in a host country increases the greater the impediments to banking across borders and {{the efficiency of the}} banking sector in the host country. There is also evidence of a tradeoff between proximity and fixed costs in banking. Banks hold more assets and liabilities in foreign affiliates relative to <b>cross-border</b> <b>positions</b> if the target country is further away and the cost of foreign direct investment is low. These results suggest that fixed costs {{play a crucial role in}} the foreign activities of banks...|$|R

40|$|The data {{collected}} by the IMF in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) provide a unique source for foreign portfolio asset holdings, with details on the breakdown by instrument and counterpart country. In the presence of sizeable <b>cross-border</b> <b>positions</b> in mutual funds, which are indistinctly classified as equity assets, the economic interpretation of the instrument and geographic composition of a countryÂ’s foreign assets might be distorted. The instrument composition tends to be skewed towards equity assets; the geographical one tends to be biased towards the countries hosting the mutual funds. This {{is the case of}} Italy, whose position in Irish and Luxembourgian mutual funds represents more than half of its entire foreign portfolio equity assets. France, Germany and Spain are in a similar, yet less disproportionate, situation. The paper proposes a correction method in order to Â‘pierce the veilsÂ’ introduced by positions in foreign mutual funds. CPIS, asset allocation, mutual funds, index of foreign bias...|$|R

40|$|We compute optimally diversified {{international}} asset portfolios {{for banks}} located in France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States using the mean-variance portfolio model with currency hedging. We compare these benchmark portfolios {{with the actual}} <b>cross-border</b> asset <b>positions</b> of banks from 1995 to 2003 and ask whether the differences are best explained by regulations, institutions, cultural conditions or other financial frictions. Our results suggest that both culture and regulations affect {{the probability of a}} country's being overweighted in banks' portfolios: countries whose residents score higher on a survey measure of trust {{are more likely to be}} overweighted, while countries that have tighter capital controls are less likely to be overweighted. From a policy standpoint, the importance of culture suggests a limit to the degree of financial integration that may be achievable by the removal of formal economic barriers.

40|$|Estimates of ex-ante equity premia are {{important}} in planning investments in pension funds, life insurance pools, and for other long-term financial obligations or goals. However, while global <b>cross-border</b> investment <b>positions</b> and flows have been rising, there is little research on non-US ex-ante equity premia or on their determinants in a global setting. This paper uses data on a recent 8 -year period from 33 countries and models simultaneously our estimate of the ex-ante equity premium as a dependent variable and our measure of financial architecture as an instrumental variable. We document that ex-ante equity premia are larger in countries that have a more bank-oriented financial architecture, are wealthier, and have better governance. These results are robust to alternative model specifications and estimation techniques. Given the importance of equity premia and financial architecture, these results should be of much interest to scholars, managers, regulators, and policy makers.

40|$|This paper reports monthly {{estimates}} of U. S. <b>cross-border</b> securities <b>positions</b> obtained {{by combining the}} (now) annual TIC surveys with monthly transactions data adjusted for various differences in the two reporting standards. Our approach {{is similar to that}} of Thomas, Warnock, and Wongswan (2004), but in addition to having a somewhat larger dataset we are able to make some simplifications to the numerical procedure used and we incorporate additional adjustments to the transactions data. This paper describes the procedure used and presents the monthly results. In addition, we discuss how the procedure can be extended to extrapolate holdings estimates beyond the most recent survey values. We focus primarily on U. S. liabilities to foreign holders, because more data is available than for U. S. claims, but we show how our methodology can be applied to U. S. claims as well. We also provide some guidance on how the changes in estimated holdings can be decomposed into flows, valuation changes, and other factors.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade Mauritius has emerged as an {{international}} financial centre, and has recently attracted global attention. Studies on the architecture of cross-border financial interconnectedness categorize Mauritius as an important node for emerging G 20 countries. In response to a request of the Mauritian Authorities {{to adhere to the}} SDDS data initiative, the IMF recommended that the central bank extend the coverage of the external sector statistics to include the <b>cross-border</b> transactions and <b>positions</b> of Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) in the offshore sector. Results of the 2011 survey of global business corporations holding a category 1 licence (GBC 1 s) domiciled in Mauritius indicate foreign assets holdings of above USD 360 billion. Because GBC 1 s are considered residents of the Mauritian economy for statistical purposes, their foreign debt liabilities have been accounted for as private external debt of the country. However for a small country with a domestic GDP of roughly US$ 12 billion, having such a disproportionate private external debt ratio to GDP distorts its gross external debt indicators and overstates its external vulnerability. These entities, though they do have real activity in Mauritius, are mostly engaged in financial intermediation between non-residents. The paper shares the view that the global statistical standard-setters may have inadequately treated special purpose entities (SPEs) and understated their special role in the global financial network.

40|$|Access {{to private}} capital markets {{is the most}} salient {{difference}} between emerging market economies and other developing countries. However, in contrast to developed economies, emerging markets have had a troubled relationship with capital fows. In particular, balance of payments and debt crises have been a recurrent problem. The three chapters of this dissertation contribute to the literature on emerging markets and their relationship with capital markets. Chapter 1 analyzes the effects of volatility on sovereign default risk. Empirically, the paper establishes a concave relationship between spreads and volatility. While for low levels of volatility an increase in volatility is associated {{with an increase in}} the sovereign risk premium, the risk premium increases at a decreasing rate. This empirical relationship is robust to different estimation methods, sam- ples and control variables. Furthermore, the relationship between volatility and risk premia is non-monotonic: while at low levels of volatility an increase in volatility implies an increase also in spreads, for sufficiently high levels of volatility this relationship turns negative. The chapter also presents a quantitative model of sovereign debt with default risk consistent with this feature and other characteristics of EME debt. The intuition for this result is the existence of a trade-off between prudential behavior in order to avoid large consumption fluctuations under autarky and the increased likelihood of a default, given default provides some short-run relief under a very bad realization of shocks. Chapter 2 addresses the determinants of the composition of <b>cross-border</b> investment <b>positions.</b> Using a novel database of bilateral capital stocks for all types of investment - FDI, portfolio equity securities, debt securities as well as loans - for a broad set of 77 countries, we show the importance of two key determinants of the composition of cross-border asset positions: information frictions and the quality of host country institutions. Overall, we find that in particular FDI, and to some extent also loans, are substantially more sensitive to information frictions than investment in portfolio equity and debt securities. We also show that the share as well as the size of FDI that a country receives are largely insensitive to corruption in host countries, while portfolio investment {{is by far the most}} sensitive to the quality of institutions. Chapter 3 focuses on a related topic to chapter 2. Using bilateral FDI stocks around the world, we explore the importance of a wide range of institutional variables as determinants of the location of FDI. While we find that better institutions have overall a positive and economically significant effect on FDI, some institutional aspects matter more than others do. Especially, the unpredictability of laws, regulations and policies, excessive regulatory burden, government instability and lack of commitment play a major role in deterring FDI. For example, the effect of a one standard deviation improvement in the regulatory quality of the host country increases FDI by a factor of around 2. These results are robust to different specifications, estimation methods and institutional variables. We also present evidence on the significance of institutions as a determinant of FDI over time...|$|R
