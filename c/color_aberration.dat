40|$|March 2004. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 16) Projector low beams {{are subject}} to <b>color</b> <b>aberrations</b> near the vertical cutoff caused by dispersion of light when passing through the lens. <b>Color</b> <b>aberrations</b> are especially of concern with high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps, because these color changes likely contribute to the discomfort-glare complaints for HIDs. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the extent and magnitude of <b>color</b> <b>aberrations</b> in HID and tungsten-halogen projector low beams. Specifically, we made colorimetric measurements near the cutoffs of 8 projector HIDs and 4 projector tungsten-halogens. For experimental control, we also evaluated 9 nonprojector HIDs and 5 nonprojector tungsten-halogens. Major color changes were present for 38 % of the HID projector lamps, 50 % of the tungstenhalogen projector lamps, and (as expected) for 0 % of the HID or tungsten-halogen nonprojector lamps. Transformation of the chromaticity data into a perceptually uniform color space indicated that the color changes caused by aberrations near the cutoff were often considerably greater than the typical color differences between tungsten-halogen and HID sources. This suggests that some of the recent concern about headlamp color and glare on the part of the driving public may be caused by color aberrations—in either tungsten-halogen or HID lamps—rather than by HID lamps themselves. To minimize discomfort glare (especially for HIDs), it is important to avoid <b>color</b> <b>aberrations</b> in the regions of the beam pattern with substantial luminous intensity levels that may be directed toward oncoming drivers...|$|R

Here we report, for the first time, the observation of an aberrantly colored Pin-tailed Sandgrouse (Pterocles alchata), a threatened steppe bird with cryptic plumage and behavior. The bird displayed a continuous white patch on its back that was not bilaterally symmetrical (i. e., {{not far from the}} neural crest), thus discarding leucism as an explanation. Plausible explanations are progressive graying and, most likely, an injury that damaged feather follicles affecting the pigment cells in that area.

50|$|Alternatively, {{the bird}} was {{considered}} a hybrid, but {{the present state of}} knowledge of the dickcissel's relations makes this not very plausible - {{there are a number of}} species with which Spiza could conceivably produce hybrids - such as Passerina -, but the lack of even the slightest hint of blue structural colors in Townsend's specimen and it moreover being not different from a dickcissel in habitus makes the hybrid theory suspect. Regardless, Townsend noted observed the bird making vocalizations reminiscent more of an indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea), and by comparing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences of the specimen with those of the dickcissel, the indigo bunting, and perhaps other Passerina, the hybridization hypothesis should be far more easy to prove or reject than a <b>color</b> <b>aberration.</b> On the other hand, there is not enough known on whether dickcissels pick up their characteristic vocalizations from conspecific males or whether they are innate, and thus no firm conclusion regarding Townsend's observations has been made.|$|E

Most existing SR techniques {{focus primarily on}} enforcing image priors or synthesizing image details; less {{attention is paid to}} the final color assignment.

In this paper, we outline a procedure based on image colorization and back-projection to perform color assignment guided by the super-resolution luminance channel. We have found that our procedure produces better results both quantitatively and qualitatively than existing approaches.

50|$|No {{specific}} details are {{known about the}} dickcissel's lipochrome metabolism; {{it may be that}} it happens to be more fine-tuned than in other birds, so that most mutations therein will be lethal and Audubon's bird was simply {{one of the very few}} individuals that survived. It stands to note that in wild birds, varying from species to species some <b>color</b> <b>aberrations</b> are less frequently seen than others, and that in captive birds such as canaries, some color mutations have only arisen a handful of times at most during several centuries of dedicated breeding and screening for novel color variants (see also Budgerigar colour genetics). While only a complete molecular biological study of the dickcissel's metabolism and the specimen's ancient DNA stands any reasonable chance to resolve the question with certainty, the hypothesis of an extremely uncommon color mutation is plausible, and such phenomena certainly occur in other Passeroidea.|$|R
50|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} {{is caused}} by a lens having a different refractive index for different wavelengths of light and the dependence of the optical properties on color.

40|$|Usually in auto {{stereoscopic}} display, {{there are}} two problems. The first problem is that large image display is difficult, and the second {{problem is that the}} view zone (which means the zone in which both eyes are put for stereoscopic or 3 -D image observation) is very narrow. We have been developing an auto stereoscopic large video display system (over 100 inches diagonal) which a few people can view simultaneously 1), 2). Usually in displays that are over 100 inches diagonal, an optical video projection system is used. As one of auto stereoscopic display systems the hologram screen has been proposed 3), 4), 5), 6). However, if the hologram screen becomes too large, the view zone (corresponding to the reconstructed diffused object) causes color dispersion and <b>color</b> <b>aberration</b> 7). We also proposed the additional Fresnel lens attached to the hologram screen. We call the screen a “hybrid hologram screen”, (HHS in short). We made the HHS 866 mm(H) × 433 mm(V) (about 40 inch diagonal) 8), 9), 10), 11). By using the lens in the reconstruction step, the angle between object light and reference light can be small, compared to without the lens. So, the spread of the view zone by the color dispersion and <b>color</b> <b>aberration</b> becomes small. And also, the virtual image which is reconstructed from the hologram screen can be transformed to a real image (view zone). So, {{it is not necessary to}} use a large lens or concave mirror while making a large hologram screen...|$|E

This technique largely depends on the accurate pixel classification (color karyotyping). We propose a Bayesian classifier for multispectral pixel classification. Due to <b>color</b> <b>aberration</b> and other source of errors, the misalignment among the different fluor images becomes inevitable, resulting in misclassified pixels. A multiresolution registration algorithm is introduced for this purpose, which is based on wavelets and spline approximations.

It indicates that the proposed registration technique leads to increased pixel classification rate, translating into improved accuracy in identifying subtle DNA rearrangements...|$|E
40|$|Coarse {{integral}} {{volumetric imaging}} (CIVI) combines multiview and volumetric display solutions and presents undistorted floating 3 D image by correcting distortion of volumetric image for each view. In the conventional CIVI with limited viewing angle, distortions of image planes can be approximated to be parabolic {{in the direction}} of depth, while those in horizontal and vertical directions can be ignored. When the viewing angle becomes wider, however, this approximation cannot realize presentation of undistorted image. To cope with the strong distortions, the method the authors propose calculate z-coordinate of the generated real image is in detail and depicts each pixel on the display panel of the corresponding depth. Also distortions in horizontal and vertical directions are corrected by using texture mapping. To attain precise correction in vertical, horizontal and depth directions, optical paths of light rays between the display panel and each viewpoint are calculated with an optical simulator. <b>Color</b> <b>aberration</b> can also be corrected by mapping red, green and blue textures separately based on the result of the optical simulation...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of diffractive optical elements on the optical aberrations. The correction of optical aberrations was investigated in the simple optical systems with one and two lenses (singlet and doublet). The advantages of diffractive optical elements are their ability to generate arbitrary complex wave fronts from a piece of optical material that is essentially flat. The optical systems consisting of the standard surfaces were designed and optimized by using the same starting points. Further, the diffractive and aspheric surfaces were introduced into the developed systems. The resulting hybrid systems were optimized. To compare the complicity {{of the development of}} narrow field systems and wide field optical systems, the optimization has been done separately for these two types of the instruments. The optical systems were designed by using special Optical Design Software. Тhe characteristics of designed diffractive surfaces were controlled in Software DIFSYS 2. 30. Due to the application of diffractive optical elements the longitudinal chromatic aberration was 5 times reduced for the narrow field systems. The absolute value of Seidel coefficient related to the spherical aberration was reduced in the range of 0. 03. Considering that diffractive optical elements have the known disadvantages, like possible parasitic diffraction orders and probable decrease of the transmission, we also developed and analyzed the optical systems with combined aspheric and diffractive surfaces. A combination of the aspheric and diffractive surfaces in the optical disk system of the disk reading lens, gave cutting down of the longitudinal <b>color</b> <b>aberrations</b> almost 15 times on-axis, comparing to the lens consisting of the aspherical and standard surfaces.

40|$|Abstract—Due to {{the novel}} fluid optics, unique image {{processing}} challenges are presented by the fluidic lens camera system. De-veloped for surgical applications, unique properties, such as no moving parts while zooming and better miniaturization than tra-ditional glass optics, are advantages of the fluid lens. Despite these abilities, sharp color planes and blurred color planes are created by the nonuniform reaction of the liquid lens to different color wavelengths. Severe axial <b>color</b> <b>aberrations</b> are caused by this re-action. In order to deblur color images without estimating a point spread function, a contourlet filter bank system is proposed. Infor-mation from sharp color planes is used by this multiband deblur-ring method to improve blurred color planes. Compared to tra-ditional Lucy-Richardson and Wiener deconvolution algorithms, significantly improved sharpness and reduced ghosting artifacts are produced by a previous wavelet-based method. Directional fil-tering {{is used by the}} proposed contourlet-based system to adjust to the contours of the image. An image is produced by the pro-posed method which has a similar level of sharpness to the previous wavelet-based method and has fewer ghosting artifacts. Conditions for when this algorithm will reduce the mean squared error are an-alyzed. While improving the blue color plane by using information from the green color plane is the primary focus of this paper, these methods could be adjusted to improve the red color plane. Many multiband systems such as global mapping, infrared imaging, and computer assisted surgery are natural extensions of this work. This information sharing algorithm is beneficial to any image set with high edge correlation. Improved results in the areas of deblurring, noise reduction, and resolution enhancement can be produced by the proposed algorithm.

40|$|AbstractA novel {{cryogenic}} optical-microscope {{system was}} developed in which the objective lens is set inside of the cryostat adiabatic vacuum space.

Therefore, the authors {{were able to use}} a color-aberration corrected objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0. 9. The lens is equipped with an air vent for compatibility to the vacuum. The theoretically expected spatial resolutions of 0. 39 μm along the lateral direction and 1. 3 μm along the axial direction were achieved by the developed system. The system was applied to the observations of non-uniform distributions of the photosystems in the cells of a green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, at 94 K. Gaussian decomposition analysis of the fluorescence spectra at all the pixels clearly demonstrated a non-uniform distribution of the two photosystems, as reflected in the variable ratios of the fluorescence intensities assigned to photosystem II and to those assigned to photosystem I. The system was also applied to the fluorescence spectroscopy of single isolated photosystem I complexes at 90 K. The fluorescence, assigned to be emitted from a single photosystem I trimer, showed an intermittent fluctuation called blinking, which is typical for a fluorescence signal from a single molecule. The vibronic fluorescence bands at around 790 nm were observed for single photosystem I trimers, suggesting that the <b>color</b> <b>aberration</b> is not serious up to the 800 nm spectral region...|$|E

LED video screens are bright, visually attractive, can stand severe weather conditions, and consume far less power than CRT technology. In LED screens technology, pixels are composed of three primary LED colors: red, green, and blue (RGB). Using the primary colored LEDs provide the ability to generate variety of color hues, saturations and values. However, the RGB LEDs in the screen's pixels have different luminance and color due to the LEDs themselves. These differences seriously destroy the white balance of the LED pixels and modules, and make the picture <b>color</b> <b>aberration,</b> blotchy and patchy. To overcome these problems, different techniques and methodologies has been proposed in the literature.

When {{the targets}} or the {{background}} {{in a display}} are different <b>colors,</b> longitudinal chromatic <b>aberration</b> ensures {{that there is no}} single correct accommodative response. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine whether the response becomes more variable when viewing certain multicolor displays. Methods. Accommodative responses of five young participants were measured with a dynamic infrared optometer while they viewed steady targets at a nominal stimulus level of 3 D. Target-on-background color combinations were black on white, black on blue, black on red, blue on red, red on blue, dark blue on red, and dark red on blue. Results. When compared with the standard black-on-white target, responses to targets with reduced spectral bandwidth were not significantly more variable. In most participants, responses to near-isoluminant targets (e. g., red on blue and blue on red) were not more variable than to the standard target. However, calculated confidence intervals cannot rule out moderate to large changes in variability near isoluminance. Responses to these multicolor targets tended to favor the blue focus. Conclusions.

50|$|The Diana is a {{very simply}} {{constructed}} box camera with a mechanical film advance, spring-loaded shutter, and a primitive plastic viewfinder. It is constructed primarily of low-quality phenolic plastics of the type commonly found in toys imported from Asia during the 1960s. Because of wide variances in production quality, combined with a poorly designed camera body latching mechanism, Diana cameras are predisposed to light leaks onto the exposed film. If not desired, such leaks can be temporarily remedied by sealing the seams with light-proof tape after loading the film. The design of the Diana incorporates a crude lens that produces an image circle which only marginally covers the diagonal of a film frame. This marginal coverage field produces images with often pronounced vignetting. The poor quality of the plastic meniscus lens results in generally low contrast and resolution, odd <b>color</b> rendition, chromatic <b>aberration,</b> and blurred images. Additionally, the film spool may become loose or out of place when winding the film {{on to the next}} frame. Finally, the crude advance and shutter mechanism can result in images that are not properly centered or exposed.|$|R

Note that, although chromatic aberration is often perceived as [...] "blurry vision" [...] in the lens periphery and gives the impression of power error, this is actually due to <b>color</b> shifting. Chromatic <b>aberration</b> can be improved by using a material with improved ABBE. The best way to combat lens induced power error is to limit the choice of corrective lens to one {{that is in the}} best spherical form. A lens designer determines the best-form spherical curve using the Oswalt curve on the Tscherning ellipse. This design gives the best achievable optical quality and least sensitivity to lens fitting. A flatter base-curve is sometimes selected for cosmetic reasons. Aspheric or atoric design can reduce errors induced by using a suboptimal flatter base-curve. They cannot surpass the optical quality of a spherical best-form lens, but can reduce the error induced by using a flatter than optimal base curve. The improvement due to flattening is most evident for strong farsighted lenses. High myopes (-6D) may see a slight cosmetic benefit with larger lenses. Mild prescriptions will have no perceptible benefit (-2D). Even at high prescriptions some high myope prescriptions with small lenses may not see any difference, since some aspheric lenses have a spherically designed center area for improved vision and fit.|$|R
