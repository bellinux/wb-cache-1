The PHP permits the better combination of the social and personal interests of the working people. The substantial role of the PHPs in agricultural production is quite clearly demonstrated by the fact that under the Tenth Five-Year Plan, they accounted for more than 25 % of the total gross agricultural product, including approximately 31 % of the output of animal husbandry. The share of personal household plots in commodity output was roughly 11 %. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} extent to which the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) brings about a {{reduction}} in surplus commodity production, I develop a simple model that incorporates the farm-level production effects of entry into the Reserve. The model is used to estimate the reduction in aggregate program crop acreage under two CRP program alternatives: (1) the "base bite," which requires a proportional reduction in a farm's <b>commodity</b> <b>base</b> as a condition of CRP entry (the current law) and (2) no base bite, which for supply control purposes would rely upon a "displacement" of acreage actually available for planting. Data from the first four rounds of CRP bidding permit comparison of the supply control impacts of the alternative provisions. The base bite is shown to have reduced aggregate program crop plantings by 8. 7 million acres, while displacement would have reduced plantings by 8. 0 million acres. Land Economics/Use,...|$|E

30|$|The Turkish {{economic}} transformation {{can be analyzed}} by <b>commodity</b> <b>base</b> productivity growth calculation via input–output tables. This method of calculation gives information about dynamic developments {{in the economy and}} helps understand the role of the productivity growth of export goods, which is the driving force of economic growth in export growth countries. Furthermore, increasing productivity in the export goods sector means that much more complicated products begin to be transacted, namely, technological change emerges related to a revolutionary economic condition. To find the productivity growth rates, labor input is used to divide sectors into non-tradable goods and export goods, which are specific conceptions intended to create macroeconomic factors to explain structural transformation from the 1970 s onward. Although technological transformation plays a crucial role in enabling developing economies to catch up, lack of proper institutional changes can be a barrier. In addition, different development paths require different institutional forms. Therefore, unfavorable institutional changes can cause slow economic development and slow structural transformation.|$|E
40|$|The 2002 Farm Act {{provided}} farmland owners {{the opportunity}} to update commodity program base acres and payment yields used for calculating selected program benefits. Findings in this report suggest that farmland owners responded to economic incentives in these decisions, selecting those options for designating base acres {{that resulted in the}} greatest expected flow of program payments. Decisions of farmland owners in South Dakota, in upland cotton area, and in the Heartland region support the payment-maximization argument. In general, landowners favored maximizing payments over aligning base acres to current or recent plantings. Farmland owners with high-payment base acres, such as rice and cotton, held on to these base acres and, whenever possible, expanded them. Analogously, landowners with low-payment <b>commodity</b> <b>base</b> acres, such as oats and barley, switched to higher payment commodities whenever possible. base, 2002 Farm Act, direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, production flexibility contract payments, base acres, program yields, Agricultural and Food Policy, Farm Management,...|$|E

40|$|Malawi, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe depend {{heavily on}} export {{earnings}} from a narrow base of agricultural commodities (coffee, cotton, sugar, tea, and tobacco). This dependence increased between 1961 - 1973 and 1974 - 1987, when international prices for those commodities were declining and unstable. Policymakers {{concerned with the}} instability and downward trend in export earnings for the three countries, tend to equate these trends with the countries'narrow export <b>commodity</b> <b>base.</b> They often propose export diversification as an expedient remedy. But the authors found that horizontal diversification would have produced lower export earnings and more instability. Policymakers introducing horizontal diversification must first consider price forecasts, comparative advantage, the economy's changing structure, {{and the costs of}} adjustment. Reactions to historical price movements can produce unexpected, undesirable results. A shift during this period from favorable to unfavorable price trends, and shifts in the covariances of deviations from price trends, complicate the design of export diversification policies, especially policies aimed at stabilizing export earnings. Generally, {{the most effective way to}} achieve growth and stability in export earnings is to increase and stabilize agricultural production and the volume of exports. The authors analysis shows that different export diversification policies can help fulfill different policy goals.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the policy instrument {{by which a}} land retirement program designed primarily for conservation purposes attempts to reduce surplus commodity production as well. A simple model incorporating the cropland al-location effects of entry into the federal Con-servation Reserve Program (CRP) is developed to estimate the reduction in aggregate crop acreage brought about under two program al-ternatives: (I) the "base bite, " which requires a reduction in a farm's <b>commodity</b> <b>base</b> {{as a condition of}} CRP entry (the current law) and (2) no base bite, which for planting reduction purposes would rely upon a "displacement " of acreage actually available for planting. Data from the first eight rounds of CRP bidding (through February 1989) show that the base bite reduces CRP entrants ' aggregate annual program crop plantings by 14. 9 million acres under 1987 program rules, while displacement would have reduced plantings by 13. 1 million acres. Under " 1990 rules " (no set-aside re-quired for participation), the base bite provision would reduce plantings by 19. 6 million acres. Displacement is unaffected by set-aside levels. If the base bite were removed, the concomitant lower opportunity costs of entry would result in either an increase in CRP acreage or a decrease in budget outlays, depending upon program administration. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) {{was an integral part of}} the compromise be-tween agricultural and environmental interests in the passage of the 1985 Food Security Act. Reflecting this compromise, the CRP was given several stated objectives, among them erosion reduction, habitat improvement and surplus commodity reduction, and one implied objec-tive, budget reduction.
