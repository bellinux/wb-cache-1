5|$|Chapter 2 {{examines}} {{productivity in}} the contemporary economy. Cowen describes spurts in productivity growth, 2.8% between 1996 and 2000 and 3.8% from 2000 to 2004, and he asks if they disprove the stagnation thesis. He <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> there have been gains in certain areas, such as information technology, but argues that in other important areas such as finance, which is 8% of GDP, there has been less value created.|$|E
5|$|From {{this model}} of Kantian ethics, O'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice. She argues that the {{rejection}} of certain principles, such as deception and coercion, provides {{a starting point for}} basic conceptions of justice, which she argues are more determinate for human beings that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> these principles may seem to be excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E
5|$|Historian Wilson D. Miscamble {{argues that}} Kennan played a {{critical}} role in developing the foreign policies of the Truman administration. He also states that Kennan did not believe in either global or strongpoint containment; he simply wanted to restore the balance of power between the United States and the Soviets. Like historian John Lewis Gaddis, Miscamble <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> although Kennan personally preferred political containment, his recommendations ultimately resulted in a policy directed more toward strongpoint than to global containment.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{decades after}} his 1839 paper and {{shortly before his}} death, Darwin <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> he was incorrect. However, he had <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> he was embarrassed by [...] "that confounded paper of mine" [...] as early as 1861, in letters to Thomas Jamieson, quoted by Jamieson (1863; 1892).|$|R
50|$|If it is <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> {{philosophical}} {{claims are}} {{a function of}} the sophistication of conceptual distinctions, arguments, and logical tools, and if it is <b>conceded</b> <b>that</b> there has been progress in making conceptual distinctions, progress in our sophistication about the nature of philosophical arguments, and progress in logic, then clearly there is progress in philosophy.|$|R

5|$|The nearby hill forts of Figsbury Ring, Quarley Hill, and Bury Hill were {{probably}} established {{around the same}} time as Danebury. All of a similar size, the hillforts were generally equally spaced, commanding similar sized territories and resources. There is some debate whether hill forts were purely defensive structures, and to what extent they were occupied. Cunliffe interprets the ramparts as essentially defensive, although he <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> they may have been a means of displaying wealth and power, as Danebury would have been visible for miles around.|$|E
5|$|Stossel {{has criticized}} {{government}} programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful. He has also criticized the American legal system, opining {{that it provides}} lawyers and vexatious litigators the incentive to file frivolous lawsuits indiscriminately. Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to private citizens, taxpayers, consumers and businesses. Although Stossel <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> some lawsuits are {{necessary in order to}} provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power, he advocates the adoption in the U.S. of the English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or frivolous lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Sasuke is the remarkable, sole {{survivor}} of the once powerful Uchiha clan of Konoha. At age seven, he survived the massacre of his entire clan {{at the hands of}} his brother, Itachi Uchiha, who spared his life only because he deemed Sasuke unworthy to kill. When first assigned to Team 7, Sasuke is antisocial, superior and unwilling to cooperate with his team members, Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, but he eventually <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> they are useful. Sasuke awakens his Sharingan, the inherited ability of the Uchiha clan to see through illusions (genjutsu), which allows him to see and learn imperceptible movements at a super-human rate. As time passes, Sasuke seeks out very strong opponents in order to convince himself that he is growing physically.|$|E

5|$|The art {{historian}} Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson posits that {{the painting is}} informed by the progressive style of French realists such as Rosa Bonheur and Gustave Courbet. She <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> there is no documentary evidence to suggest Predić was influenced by Courbet's depictions of peasant life, but notes that the latter's work was {{in the public domain}} at the time Happy Brothers was created and was quite popular throughout Europe. Filipovitch-Robinson believes that Predić rejected the precision and linearism of both Academic and Biedermeier art, and, as Courbet would have done, used heavily textured brushstrokes to define the roughness of the muddy road. She also draws parallels between the painting and Courbet's Peasants of Flagey, which was shown at the Paris Salon of 1850–51 alongside The Stone Breakers and A Burial At Ornans.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} Archer discovers Robinson packing up the {{contents}} of his locker. He <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> it is primarily an intermix problem, but that the engine could still work. Archer and Robinson then steal the NX Beta, with Tucker in flight control, but it starts to suffer the same issues as the Alpha. As Starfleet security detains Tucker, Archer and Robinson manage to coax the engines towards their goal of warp 2.5. Afterwards, Archer and Robinson are reprimanded by Starfleet, and the Vulcans ground the program for a year, but they eventually confirm that his father's design was sound. Back in the future, Archer launches the charges into the cloud, and T'Pol suggests that it be named after Archer's close friend, Robinson.|$|E
5|$|After Italy's {{declaration}} of war against Austria-Hungary on 23 May, Admiral Anton Haus, the fleet commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy sortied his fleet to bombard the Italian coast {{on the night of}} 23/24 May in an attempt to disrupt the Italian mobilization. Of the many targets, Ancona was hardest hit, with disruptions to the town's gas, electric, and telephone service; the city's stockpiles of coal and oil were left in flames. All of the Austrian ships safely returned to port, making it seem that they had been able to attack with impunity, putting political pressure on the Regia Marina from Rome. When the Austrians resumed attacks on the Italian coast in mid-June, Italian Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel responded by sending Amalfi and the other armored cruisers at Brindisi—the navy's newest—to Venice to supplement the older ships already there. Historian Lawrence Sondhaus argues that the arrival of the four fast armored cruisers in Venice should have been a major deterrent against future Austrian coastal raids, but <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> they ended up becoming more inviting targets for Austrian U-boats instead.|$|E

5|$|Copp {{wrote that}} Charnwood should have {{produced}} a rapid breakthrough but <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> the battle {{was one of the}} most difficult of the campaign. Buckley singles out poor cooperation between armoured and infantry units as one of the reasons for such high Allied losses; he is critical of the habit of tanks standing off from German positions and firing the infantry onto the objective like artillery, instead of moving forward to give close support. He further notes that from the German perspective, the Anglo-Canadian forces apparently lacked the desire or ability to press home their advantages, citing Kurt Meyer's opinion that during the battle the Allies allowed the opportunity of destroying his 12th SS Panzer Division to elude them. Buckley comments on the defensive power of the British and Canadian formations. The German practice of conducting immediate local counter-attacks to retake lost ground cost them many of their best troops, losses they could ill-afford. He illustrates this with a typical action during which the Germans lost 13 tanks to British self-propelled anti-tank guns.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} and final case, Phoenix is visiting a {{mountain}} retreat with Maya and Pearl when a fellow guest, Elise Deauxnim, is murdered. While looking for Maya, he falls into a river and becomes ill, forcing Edgeworth and Franziska to temporarily fill in as attorney and prosecutor to keep his client, a nun named Iris, from being found guilty. When Phoenix returns, he explains that Elise is really Maya's long-lost mother, Misty Fey, and that her death {{was the result of}} a plan engineered by her sister Morgan to kill Maya with the help of the now deceased Dahlia, who turns out to be Iris's twin. Through cross-examination, Phoenix reveals that not only is Dahlia impersonating Iris, she is using Maya's body to do so. With Mia's help, Dahlia is exorcised from Maya and Iris is declared innocent. Godot is revealed as the one responsible for killing Misty to protect Maya, leading to the discovery of his true identity: Diego Armando. Having spent many years blaming Phoenix for Mia's death, he sought revenge, but <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> Phoenix has done more to continue her legacy than him. Iris also reveals that she posed as Dahlia while Phoenix was attending college to protect him, ended up falling in love with him, and that she regrets her failure to stop her sister from becoming a criminal. Reuniting with his friends, Phoenix celebrates finally being free of his past.|$|E

25|$|Using this scheme, an eight-character human-selected {{password}} without {{upper case}} letters and non-alphabetic characters {{is estimated to}} have 18 bits of entropy.

25|$|All {{investigations}} into his fate have proven fruitless, and Nickell <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> despite {{a lack of}} hard evidence that Bierce had gone to Mexico, there is also none that he had not. Therefore, despite an abundance of theories (including death by suicide), his end remains shrouded in mystery.|$|E

25|$|John C. Bogle, {{founder of}} the Vanguard Group, a leading issuer of index mutual funds (and, since Bogle's retirement, of ETFs), has argued that ETFs {{represent}} short-term speculation, that their trading expenses decrease returns to investors, and that most ETFs provide insufficient diversification. He <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> a broadly diversified ETF that is held over time {{can be a good}} investment.|$|E

After showing that speech making itself isn't something reproachful, and that what is truly shameful is to engage in speaking or writing shamefully or badly, Socrates asks what distinguishes good from bad writing, and they take this up.|$|E
25|$|In , Harris {{writes that}} the purpose of spirituality (as he defines it – he <b>concedes</b> <b>that</b> the term's uses are diverse and {{sometimes}} indefensible) is to become aware that our sense of self is illusory, and says this realization brings both happiness and insight into the nature of consciousness. He argues this process of realization is based on experience and is not contingent on faith. In the same book, he describes his experience with Dzogchen, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice, and recommends it to his readers.|$|E

50|$|The constellations Roslin {{identifies}} in the Tomb {{correspond to}} the real-life Zodiacal constellations. Moore and Eick <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> all twelve of these constellations cannot be viewed simultaneously {{in the night sky}} but say it would be disorienting for the audience to rotate the sky throughout the scene {{in a way that would}} make the representation faithful. They also <b>concede</b> <b>that</b> the constellations shown in the episode do not resemble the real-life constellations.|$|R
