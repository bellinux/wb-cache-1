40|$|In {{recent years}} a {{significant}} amount of effort has been devoted to develop damage-tolerant hot gas filter elements, which can withstand chemical, high pressure and extreme thermal cyclic loading in the coal-based environment (Alvin 1999, Spain and Starrett 1999). <b>Ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> have proven to be an effective filter for the ash laden gas streams, protecting the gas turbine components from exposure to particulate matter (Lippert et al. 1994). <b>Ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> need to sustain extreme thermal environment and vibration-induced stresses over a great period of time. Destructive tests have been used to describe physical, mechanical and thermal properties of the filters and to relate these properties and behaviors to in-service performance, and ultimately to predict the useful life of the filter materials (Pontius and Starrett 1994, Alvin et al. 1994). Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques have been developed to determine the deterioration or the presence of damage and to estimate the remaining stiffness of <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> (Chen and Kiriakidis 2001). This paper presents a study of parameters involved in the prediction of remaining life of <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> under service conditions. About one hundred <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> from previous studies (Chen and Kiriakidis 2000) and forty-six filters received during this project have been nondestructively evaluated. They are divided in Pall Vitropore, Schumacher and Coors filters. Forty-six of these filters were used having various in-service exposure times at the PSDF and the rest were unused filters.

40|$|High-temperature ceramic candle {{filters are}} being {{developed}} for use in advanced power generation systems such as the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC), Pressurized Fluidized-Bed Combustor (PFBC), and Direct Coal-Fired Turbine (DCFT). The direct firing of coal produces particulate matter which must be removed to meet both environmental and process limitations. The ceramic candles increase {{the efficiency of the}} advanced power generation systems and protect downstream equipment from erosion and impingement of particulate matter in the hot exhaust gases. Ceramic candle filters are rigid, closed-ended (capped on one side) porous cylinders which generally have a flange on the open-ended side. The flange at the open end allows the candle to be suspended by a tubesheet in the filter vessel. Candle filters have shown promise, but have also encountered durability problems during use in hostile, high-temperature environments. Limitations in the candle lifetime lower the economic advantages of using candle filters for this application. Candles typically fail by cracking at the flange or {{in the body of the}} candle. The objective of this project was to test and analyze <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> materials and to evaluate the degradation mechanisms.

40|$|Nondestructive {{evaluation}} (NDE) {{techniques have}} been used to reduce the potential mechanical failures and to improve the reliability of a structure. Failure of a structure is usually initiated at some type of flaw in the material. NDE techniques have been developed to determine the presence of flaws larger than an acceptable size and to estimate the remaining stiffness of a damaged structure (Chen, et. al, 1995). <b>Ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> have been tested for use in coal-fueled gas turbine systems. They protect gas turbine components from damage due to erosion. A total of one hundred and one <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> were nondestructively evaluated in this study. Ninety-eight <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> and three <b>ceramic</b> composite filters have been nondestructively inspected using dynamic characterization technique. These ceramic filters include twelve unused Coors alumina/mullite, twenty-four unused and fifteen used Schumacher-Dia-Schumalith TF- 20, twenty-five unused and nine used Refractron 326, eight unused and three used Refractron 442 T, one new Schumacher-T 10 - 20, and one used Schumacher-Dia-Schumalith F- 40. All filters were subjected to a small excitation and the dynamic response was picked up by a piezoelectric accelerometer. The evaluation of experimental results was processed using digital signal analysis technique including various forms of data transformation. The modal parameters for damage assessment for the unexposed (unused) vs. exposed (used) specimen were based on two vibration parameters: natural frequencies and mode shapes. Finite Element models were built for each specimen type to understand its dynamic response. Linear elastic modal analysis was performed using eight nodes, three-dimensional isotropic solid elements. Conclusions based on our study indicate that dynamic characterization is a feasible NDE technique in studying structural properties of <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters.</b> It has been shown that the degradation of the filters due to long working hours (or excessive back pulsing conditions and high temperature transient) could be reflected from the shift of vibration frequencies. These shifts are due to changes in structural properties such as stiffness, which are directly related to the Young's modulus of the <b>candle</b> <b>filters.</b> Further studies are necessary in implementing and verifying the applicability of dynamic NDE characterization methods for actual in-situ conditions, and in establishing a systematic testing procedure for field applications.

40|$|The rigid {{ceramic filters}} have been {{recognized}} to be a most promising kind of equipment for the gas-solid separation and the cleaning of hot gases due to their unique properties and higher separation efficiency for larger than 5 {micro}m particles, which will well meet downstream system component protection and environmental standards.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the performance of a}} low-cost <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> system (CCFS) for point of use (POU) drinking water treatment in the village of Hobeni, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. CCFSs were distributed in Hobeni and a survey was carried out among their users. The performance of 51 CCFSs was evaluated by dip slides and related to human factors. Already after two-thirds of their specified lifetime, none of the distributed CCFSs produced water without distinct contamination, and more than one-third even deteriorated in hygienic water quality. Besides the water source (springs were preferable compared to river or rain water), a high water throughput was the dominant reason for poor CCFS performance. A stepwise laboratory test documented the negative effects of repeated loading and ambient field temperatures. These findings suggest that not every CCFS type per se guarantees improved drinking water security and that the efficiency of low-cost systems should continuously be monitored. For this purpose, dip slides were found to be a cost-efficient alternative to standard laboratory tests. They consistently underestimated microbial counts but can be used by laypersons and hence by the users themselves to assess critical contamination of their filter systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} integrity of ceramic candle filters {{is a key}} element for hot gas cleanup systems, They protect the heat exchanger and gas turbine components from getting clogged and also prevent erosion. Ceramic candle filters used in the recent demonstration plant have experienced degradation and fracturing. Preliminary examination of these ceramic filters indicated that damage of the filters may have resulted from strength degradation at consistent high temperature operation, thermal transient events, excessive ash accumulation and bridging and pulse cleaning. The <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> is a slender structure made of layers of porous materials. The structure has high acoustic attenuation which has greatly limited the conventional ultrasonic detection capability. In general, stiffness reduction of a structure will cause the change of the modal parameters of the structure. This study proposes a nondestructive approach for evaluating the structural properties of the ceramic filters using dynamic characterization method. The vibration signatures of the ceramic filters at different degradation levels are established using transient impact-response technique. Results from this study indicate that the vibration signatures of the filters can be used as an index to quantify the darnage condition of the filters.

40|$|Ceramic barrier {{filtration}} is {{a leading}} technology employed in hot gas filtration. Hot gases loaded with ash particle flow through the <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> and deposit ash on their outer surface. The deposited ash is periodically removed using back pulse cleaning jet, known as surface regeneration. The cleaning done by this technique still leaves some residual ash on the filter surface, which {{over a period of}} time sinters, forms a solid cake and leads to mechanical failure of the <b>candle</b> <b>filter.</b> A room temperature testing facility (RTTF) was built to gain more insight into the surface regeneration process before testing commenced at high temperature. RTTF was instrumented to obtain pressure histories during the surface regeneration process and a high-resolution high-speed imaging system was integrated in order to obtain pictures of the surface regeneration process. The objective of this research has been to utilize the RTTF to study the surface regeneration process at the convenience of room temperature conditions.

These HWTS were manufactured in the workshop of the Tshwane University of Technology and evaluated for efficiency to remove turbidity, faecal coliforms and Escherichia coli from multiple water source samples, using standard methods. The flow rates ranged from 0. 05 L/h to 2. 49 L/h for SIPP, 1 L/h to 4 L/h for CCF, 0. 81 L/h to 6. 84 L/h for BSF-S, 1. 74 L/h to 19. 2 L/h and 106. 5 L/h to 160. 5 L/h for BF The turbidity of the raw water samples ranged between 2. 17 and 40. 4 NTU.

40|$|For {{coal-fired}} power plants utilizing a gas turbine, the removal of ash particles is necessary to protect the turbine and to meet emission standards. Advantages are also evident for a filter system that can remove other coal-derived contaminants such as alkali, halogens, and ammonia. With most particulates and other contaminants removed, erosion and corrosion of turbine materials, as well as deposition of particles within the turbine, are reduced to acceptable levels. The granular bed filter is suitable for this task in a pressurized gasification or combustion environment. The objective of the base contract was to develop conceptual designs of moving granular bed filter (GBF) and <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> technologies for control of particles from integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC), and direct coal-fueled turbine (DCFT) systems.

40|$|Early {{observations}} of the Advanced Particulate Filter (APF) at the Tidd PFBC Demonstration Plant led {{to the conclusion that}} tenacious ash deposits formed in the filter vessel and induced stresses that resulted in bent or broken <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> elements. The proximity of these bent and broken candle filter elements to large, strong ash deposits emphasized the need to prevent or control the growth of these deposits, facilitate their on-line removal, and/or to develop filter design criteria to minimize their effects on individual filter elements. The chemical characteristics of the ashes collected in the Tidd APF combined with the environment within the filter vessel tend to cause ash deposits formed in the filter vessel to consolidate and strengthen. One theory that may explain the growth and strengthening of these deposits is based on the formation of eutectics such as various calcium aluminosilicate compounds. These eutectics form when primary coal ash particles come into physical contact with sorbent-derived ash particles which contain relatively large amounts of magnesium and/or calcium. Aluminosilicate compounds in the coal ash particles react with alkali metals in the sorbent ash particles to form eutectics that melt at relatively low temperatures. The surface tension of the near-liquid layer on the particles pulls adjacent ash particles closer together, thereby eventually consolidating the structure of the entire ash agglomerate. The optimum solution to the problems caused by the ash aggregates that have been consolidated and strengthened by pervasive eutectic formation is the removal of these aggregates from the APF before the eutectics have had enough time to develop. The approach that proved most successful in eliminating the deposits was the total bypassing of the cyclone upstream of the APF. This increased the size distribution of the particles forming the various ash deposits, thereby decreasing their inherent cohesivity...|$|E

40|$|Reliable, {{maintainable}} {{and cost}} effective hot gas particulate filter technology {{is critical to}} the successful commercialization of advanced, coal-fired power generation technologies, such as IGCC and PFBC. In pilot plant testing, the operating reliability of hot gas particulate filters have been periodically compromised by process issues, such as process upsets and difficult ash cake behavior (ash bridging and sintering), and by design issues, such as cantilevered filter elements damaged by ash bridging, or excessively close packing of filtering surfaces resulting in unacceptable pressure drop or filtering surface plugging. This test experience has focused the issues and has helped to define advanced hot gas filter design concepts that offer higher reliability. Westinghouse has identified two advanced ceramic barrier filter concepts that are configured to minimize the possibility of ash bridge formation and to be robust against ash bridges should they occur. The ''inverted candle filter system'' uses arrays of thin-walled, ceramic candle-type filter elements with inside-surface filtering, and contains the filter elements in metal enclosures for complete separation from ash bridges. The ''sheet filter system'' uses ceramic, flat plate filter elements supported from vertical pipe-header arrays that provide geometry that avoids the buildup of ash bridges and allows free fall of the back-pulse released filter cake. The Optimization of Advanced Filter Systems program is being conducted to evaluate these two advanced designs and to ultimately demonstrate one of the concepts in pilot scale. In the Base Contract program, the subject of this report, Westinghouse has developed conceptual designs of the two advanced ceramic barrier filter systems to assess their performance, availability and cost potential, and to identify technical issues that may hinder the commercialization of the technologies.

This thesis evaluates the performance of five brands of <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> that are locally available in the developing nation of Kenya: the AquaMaster (Piedra candle), Doulton Super Sterasyl, Stefani Sao Joao, Pelikan, and Pozzani <b>candles.</b> <b>Filters</b> were evaluated based on turbidity removal, flow rate, total coliform and E. coli removal, and cost. The Pelikan filters were also subjected to tests for viral removal using MS 2 -coliphages. Results from studies indicated that the Pelikan filters were the most effective at removing turbidity from Charles River water (97 % reduction). Turbidity removal by other filters ranged from 88 %- 94 %. Results from studies utilizing more turbid Nairobi water showed filters to reduce turbidity by 97 %- 99 %. Results from flow rate studies performed at MIT revealed the Doulton Super Sterasyl to possess a significantly greater flow rate (0. 55 L/hr) than the other brands. The flow rates of the other filters ranged from 0. 14 - 0. 26 L/hr. Filter tests utilizing the more turbid Nairobi water showed flow rates of 0. 09 - 0. 24 L/hr. Results from coliform removal studies performed at MIT showed the AquaMaster (Piedra candle), Doulton Super Sterasyl, and Pelikan filters to remove significantly more total coliform and E. coli than the Pozzani filters. Percent removal by all filters tested at MIT ranged from 92 %-< 100 %. Filter tests performed in Kenya showed percent total coliform and E. coli removals of up to 99. 995 %. (cont.) The Pelikan filters were the cheapest filters purchased, retailing for $ 2 in Nairobi. Results of viral removal studies indicated that the Pelikan filters were not effective at removing viruses from solution. The results of this study support the use of Pelikan filters as an inexpensive and integral step in the household water treatment process. Sedimentation and/or coagulation are recommended pre-filtration if highly turbid water is to be filtered. This action will ensure a higher flow rate. Additionally, disinfection is recommended post-filtration to remove any residual bacteria. by Amber Franz. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|In {{advanced}} {{coal-fired power}} generation, one technology under development {{to clean up}} hot gases before their use as fuel for gas turbines is rigid <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters.</b> These porous filters are typically 1. 5 m long and 60 mm in diameter and are made of various ceramic materials, including clay-bonded SiC. The high costs of downtime in a large utility demands that nondestructive evaluation/characterization (NDE/C) methods be available. At shutdowns, data from such analysis are needed to decide which filters are still usable and which need to be replaced, and if possible, to estimate the remaining lifetimes. Thus our objective was to develop reliable low-cost NDE technology for these filters. Our approach was to develop NDE/C technology, referred to as acousto-ultrasonics (AU), for application to hot gas filters. Lamb waves generated by the AU method were analyzed to derive a stress wave factor (SWF). This technology was tested by comparing SWF data with the measured strength {{for a variety of}} rigid ceramic filters and was shown to work on iron-aluminide filters as well but no strength data have been obtained on the iron-aluminides at this time...|$|R
40|$|The {{full-flow}} mechanical safeguard device (FFMSGD) {{has been}} developed under contract to the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) to address problems with the reliability of <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> elements installed on high-temperature, high-pressure (HTHP) Hot Gas Cleanup (HGCU) filters. Although systems candle filters are expected to perform satisfactorily when in good operating condition, the failure of even a single filter element can increase the filter system outlet dust loading enough to potentially damage gas turbine blades, contaminate other downstream processes, and limit {{the availability of the}} power system. Filter failure safeguard devices that are installed on each individual candle filter element are envisioned as a guarantee of a candle filter system's ability to withstand some number of element failures and continue operation without these negative consequences. The intention of the FFMSGD is to provide this guarantee without incurring any significant pressure drop penalty or constraining the filter system's reverse-pulse cleaning procedures. The FFMSGD provides a clear flow path for filtered and reverse-flow cleaning gases when its filter element is intact, and activates to provide a positive mechanical seal against gas flow in either direction when its filter element breaks or fails. This activation is induced by the increase in the flow rate of gas through the device in event of filter failure. The FFMSGD is designed to be easily removed and reconditioned when the filter system is taken off line for routine maintenance. This report is intended to be issued with a companion appendix. As instructed in Section J. 12 of Contract No. DE-AC 26 - 99 FT 40678, all the restricted, proprietary, and patentable information (not yet disclosed through the patent application process) related to the FFMSGD and its evaluation under this contract has been included only in the appendix. This Final Report, which is available to the public, contains background information and general descriptions of the operating principles of the FFMSGD. This report also describes the results of various evaluations of the device at room temperature and in HTHP environments. This Final Report also includes discussions of commercialization issues. For clarity and completeness, all of the information contained in this Final Report has also been included in the appendix...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} {{technologies that}} are being considered for generating electric power {{on a large scale}} by burning coal are Pressurized Fluid Bed Combustion (PFBC) systems and Integrated Gasification and Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems. Particulate emission regulations that have been proposed for future systems may require that these systems be fitted with large scale Hot Gas Clean-Up (HGCU) filtration systems that would remove the fine particulate matter from the hot gas streams that are generated by PFBC and IGCC systems. These hot gas filtration systems are geometrically and aerodynamically complex. They typically are constructed with large arrays of <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> elements (CFE). The successful design of these systems require an accurate assessment of the rate at which mechanical energy of the gas flow is dissipated as it passes through the filter containment vessel and the individual candle filter elements that make up the system. Because the filtration medium is typically made of a porous ceramic material having open pore sizes that are much smaller than the dimensions of the containment vessel, the filtration medium is usually considered to be a permeable medium that follows Darcy's law. The permeability constant that is measured in the lab {{is considered to be a}} function of the filtration medium only and is usually assumed to apply equally to all the filters in the vessel as if the flow were divided evenly among all the filter elements. In general, the flow of gas through each individual CFE will depend not only on the geometrical characteristics of the filtration medium, but also on the local mean flows in the filter containment vessel that a particular filter element sees. The flow inside the CFE core, through the system manifolds, and inside the containment vessel itself will be coupled to the flow in the filter medium by various Reynolds number effects. For any given filter containment vessel, since the mean flows are different in different locations inside the vessel, the flow of gas through an individual CFE will adjust itself to accommodate the local mean flows that prevail in its general location. In some locations this adjustment will take place at High Reynolds numbers and in other locations this will occur at low Reynolds numbers. The analysis done here investigates the nature of this coupling...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. The {{world is}} {{focusing}} on {{increasing the number of}} people who have access to safe drinking water due to the ascending numbers of drinking water related illnesses reported annually in rural areas where water is not treated before consumption. To meet this goal, household water treatment has to be introduced especially in places where homes are wide apart making centralised water treatment improbable. Most readily available household water treatment systems (HWTS) such as membrane filters may not be affordable in rural areas due to power requirements and degree of ability to use and maintain them. This study was therefore aimed at designing and constructing HWTS using readily available material such as sand, gravel, zeolites and clays. Five HWTS were designed, built, evaluated and compared based on their ability to remove chemical contaminants such as iron, arsenic and fluorides from drinking water. The types of filters that were used during this study are the biosand filter (BSF), a modified biosand filter with zeolites (BSFZ), a silver impregnated porous pot (SIPP) filter, a <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> (CCF) and a bucket filter (BF). Effectiveness of the filters in reducing physical parameters such as turbidity and visual colour was also assessed. The water treatment devices had the following flow rates; 1. 74 L/h – 19. 20 L/h (BSFZ), 0. 81 L/h – 6. 84 L/h (BSF), 0. 05 L/h – 2. 49 L/h (SIPP) and 1. 00 L/h – 4. 00 L/h (CCF). The flow rates were high at the early stages of filter use and decreased with increase in the volume of water filtered through. The flow rates of the filters were affected by the turbidity of intake water which was between 1. 74 NTU – 42. 93 NTU and correlated to chlorophyll a concentrations. The household water treatment technologies reduced turbidity to levels less than 1 NTU (> 90 % reduction) in the following order SIPP > BSFZ > BSF > CCF > BF. The filters achieved greater than 60 % retention of calcium, magnesium, iron and arsenic. These contaminants with the exception of arsenic were reduced to acceptable levels of the South African National Standard of drinking water (SANS 241, 2004). Compared to the other filters, the BSFZ performed better in removing nitrates, phosphates and fluorides although the overall retention efficiency was low. Total organic carbon was removed greatly by the CCF (39 %) and the least removal was by the BF. The overall performance of the filters in reducing contaminants from drinking water was in the order BSFZ > BSF > SIPP > CCF > BF. Filter washing vi resulted in an overall increase in the flow rates of the filters but negatively affected turbidity reduction. The filters still removed contaminants after total cumulative volumes of 1200 L (BSFZ, BSF, CCF and BF) and 300 L (SIPP) were filtered through the devices. The five evaluated filters have several advantages to the readily available technologies and the advantages include ease of construction, operation and maintenance. The filters are gravity driven and work independent of temperature. These HWTS incorporate safe storages fitted with spigots to eliminate recontamination of water when it is drawn for use. The filters can produce enough drinking and cooking water for a family of six members due to their high flow rates. The BSFZ, BSF, SIPP, CCF and BF may therefore be considered for treating contaminated water at household scale in places where water is taken directly from the source without treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{direct firing}} of coal {{produces}} particulate matter {{that has to}} be removed for environmental and process reasons. In order to increase the current advanced coal combustion processes, under the U. S. Department of Energy's auspices, Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation (SWPC) has developed <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> that can operate at high temperatures. The Coal Research Center of Southern Illinois University (SIUC), in collaboration with SWPC, developed a program for long-term filter testing at the SIUC Steam Plant followed by experiments using a single-filter reactor unit. The objectives of this program funded by the U. S. Department of Energy were to identify and demonstrate the stability of porous <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> elements for use in high temperature atmospheric fluidized-bed combustion (AFBC) process applications. These verifications were accomplished through extended time slipstream testing of a <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> array under AFBC conditions using SIUC's existing AFBC boiler. Temperature, mass flow rate, and differential pressure across the filter array were monitored for a duration of 45 days. After test exposure at SIUC, the filter elements were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy and BET surface area analyses. In addition, a single-filter reactor was built and utilized to study long term filter operation, the permeability exhibited by a filter element before and after the slipstream test, and the thermal shock resilience of a used filter by observing differential pressure changes upon rapid heating and cooling of the filter. The data acquired during the slipstream test and the post-test evaluations demonstrated the suitability of filter elements in advanced power generation applications...|$|R
40|$|Hot gas {{particulate}} filtration is a {{basic component}} in advanced power generation systems such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion (PFBC). These systems require effective particulate removal to protect the downstream gas turbine and also to meet environmental emission requirements. The ceramic barrier filter {{is one of the}} options for hot gas filtration. Hot gases flow through <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters</b> leaving ash deposited on the outer surface of the filter. A process known as surface regeneration removes the deposited ash periodically by using a high pressure back pulse cleaning jet. After this cleaning process has been done there may be some residual ash on the filter surface. This residual ash may grow and this may lead to mechanical failure of the filter. A High Temperature Test Facility (HTTF) was built to investigate the ash characteristics during surface regeneration at high temperatures. The system is capable of conducting surface regeneration tests of a single <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> at temperatures up to 1500 F. Details of the HTTF apparatus as well as some preliminary test results are presented in this paper. In order to obtain sequential digital images of ash particle distribution during the surface regeneration process, a high resolution, high speed image acquisition system was integrated into the HTTF system. The regeneration pressure and the transient pressure difference between the inside of the <b>candle</b> <b>filter</b> and the chamber during regeneration were measured using a high speed PC data acquisition system. The control variables for the high temperature regeneration tests were (1) face velocity, (2) pressure of the back pulse, and (3) cyclic ash built-up time...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{prosperity}} and the steady {{growth of the}} world population lead to a strongly rising energy requirement. Therefore the saving of the available resources {{as well as the}} limitation of CO{sub 2 }-emission are the main reasons for developing highly efficient power stations. The use of combined cycle technology for advanced coal fired power plants allow a significantly higher conversion efficiency than it is possible in an only steam power plant. In order to increase the gas turbine inlet temperature, the filtration of fine particles is necessary. Therefore the filtration unit {{is one of the key}} components of the circulating pressurized fluidized bed combustion technology (PFBC). To use this technology more effectively, gas cleaning at high temperatures or in an reducing atmosphere is necessary. A possibility of the effective gas cleaning at high temperatures is the use of porous <b>ceramic</b> <b>candle</b> <b>filters.</b> The structure of such filter elements usually consists of a highly porous sup port which ensures the mechanical strength and a layer which operates as the functional part for the particle removal. To ensure a guaranteed lifetime of about 16000 h the effect of combustion or gasification atmosphere and temperature on the thermal and mechanical properties of the filter material has to be studied. The examinations and results, described in this article, are part of some previous work. This paper focuses especially on the chemical resistance and the thermal behaviour of the used ceramic filter materials...|$|R
