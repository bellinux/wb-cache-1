40|$|A {{composite}} {{energy storage}} system (CESS) that includes a photovoltaic (PV) power generation and an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) function is proposed. This system has three operating modes, namely, a grid-connected inverter mode, a grid-connected rectifier mode, and an islanding mode. This system is <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boost</b> converter, a three-phase inverter/rectifier, a bidirectional DC/DC converter, and thyristor switches. The boost converter extracts maximum power from the PV panels and sends it to the DC-link. The bidirectional DC/DC converter is connected between the battery and the DC-link, which leads to an optimized charging/discharging operation. The three-phase inverter/rectifier transmits the power {{to and from the}} grid. Also, it operates as a UPS in the islanding mode. The thyristor switches are used for connecting/disconnecting between the grid and the AC load. A 15 [*]kW prototype is implemented to verify the performance of the proposed system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A high step-up {{converter}} {{is proposed}} for a photovoltaic system. A voltage multiplier used here provides high voltage gain without extreme duty cycle. The voltage multiplier is <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conventional <b>boost</b> converter and coupled inductors. An extra conventional boost converter is {{integrated into the}} first phase to achieve a considerably higher voltage conversion ratio. The two-phase configuration not only reduces the current stress through each power switch, but also constrains the input current ripple, which decreases the conduction losses of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). It also functions as a clamp circuit which alleviates the voltage spikes across the power switches. So, the low-voltage-rated MOSFETs can be adopted for reductions of conduction losses and cost. Efficiency improves because the energy stored in leakage inductances is recycled to the output terminal.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, an {{isolated}} dc/dc converter is proposed for fuel cell applications. The output voltage from {{the fuel cell}} is very low typically about 30 volts. Hence the fuel cell output has to be conditioned {{so that it can}} be used for interfacing to the load. The proposed converter is <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> two parts, <b>a</b> <b>boost</b> converter and <b>a</b> CLL resonant converter. The CLL converter can be designed to have an optimal switching, regardless of the load conditions. A sliding mode control strategy for the proposed converter is also presented. Sliding-mode control has been widely used in both nonlinear and linear systems. It is well-known for its strong robustness against parameter uncertainties and load variation. The proposed controller operates at two fixed switching frequencies with sliding-mode control implementation. Simulink circuit models are developed for the proposed design and the results are used to validate the performance of the proposed sliding mode control strategy. The sliding mode control technique when implemented in hardware causes a oscillatory response due to the chattering behaviour. So a cascaded control configuration consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sliding mode control technique along with a ANFIS controller is proposed here. The ANFIS controller is used here to absorb the unwanted oscillations of the sliding mode control technique and hence produce a stable response. The hardware implementation has been done using the DSPIC 30 F 3011 controller. <b>A</b> hardware prototype <b>of</b> the proposed system along with the cascaded control configuration is developed and the performance of it has also been verified.

40|$|DOI: 10. 1049 /iet-pel. 2014. 0380 URL: [URL] Filiació URV: SIIn {{this work}} a non -linear digital control <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boost</b> {{converter}} {{based on a}} sliding discrete-time approximation is presented. The control strategy follows a classical cascade regulation scheme with the inner loop consisting in a non linear current-control based on discrete-time sliding mode, and the outer one being <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simple discrete-time PI controller for output voltage regulation. An analytical expression of the current control law is developed using a simplified discrete-time small signal model of the boost converter. The discrete-time PI compensator is designed from a discrete-time small signal parametric model of the inner loop obtained by linearization around the desired equilibrium point. The proposed method is initially based {{on the notion of}} discrete-time sliding motion to eventually derive a PWM controlled system. Thus, the reported approach can be categorized not only as a Direct Digital Design technique for voltage regulation but also as a competitive method to design sliding-mode based PWM controllers.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a novel way {{to speed up}} the evaluation time <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boosting</b> classifier. We make a shallow (flat) network deep (hierarchical) by growing a tree from decision regions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>boosting</b> classifier. The tree provides many short paths for speeding up while preserving the reasonably smooth decision regions of the boosting classifier for good generalisation. For converting <b>a</b> <b>boosting</b> classifier into <b>a</b> decision tree, we formulate a Boolean optimisation problem, which has been previously studied for circuit design but limited to <b>a</b> small number <b>of</b> binary variables. In this work, a novel optimisation method is proposed for, firstly, several tens of variables i. e. weak-learners <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>boosting</b> classifier, and then any larger number of weak-learners by using a two-stage cascade. Experiments on the synthetic and face image data sets show that the obtained tree achieves a significant speed up both over <b>a</b> standard <b>boosting</b> classifier and the Fast-exit—a previously described method for speeding-up boosting classification, at the same accuracy. The proposed method as a general meta-algorithm is also useful for <b>a</b> <b>boosting</b> cascade, where it speeds up individual stage classifiers by different gains. The proposed method is further demonstrated for fast-moving object tracking and segmentation problems...|$|R
