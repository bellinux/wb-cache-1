500|$|Quarks, {{which make}} up {{composite}} particles like neutrons and protons, come in six [...] "flavours" [...] up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom [...] which give those composite particles their properties. The weak interaction is unique in that it allows for quarks to swap their flavour for another. The swapping of those properties is mediated by the force carrier bosons. For example, during beta minus decay, a down quark within a neutron is changed into an up quark, thus converting the neutron to a proton and resulting in the emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino. Also, the weak interaction is the only fundamental interaction that breaks parity-symmetry, and similarly, {{the only one to}} break <b>charge</b> <b>parity</b> symmetry.|$|E

The discovery of <b>Charge</b> <b>Parity</b> violation helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry, originally thought to be perfect, was only approximate.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are only}} a very limited set of {{possibilities}} for the final state. The most probable {{is the creation of}} two or more gamma ray photons. Conservation of energy and linear momentum forbid the creation of only one photon. (An exception to this rule can occur for tightly bound atomic electrons.) In the most common case, two photons are created, each with energy equal to the rest energy of the electron or positron (...) [...] A convenient frame of reference is that in which the system has no net linear momentum before the annihilation; thus, after collision, the gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions. It is also common for three to be created, since in some angular momentum states, this is necessary to conserve <b>charge</b> <b>parity.</b> It is also possible to create any larger number of photons, but the probability becomes lower with each additional photon because these more complex processes have lower probability amplitudes.|$|E
