A hot medium (i.e., radio or Movie) extends a single sense in “high definition”. High definition means the state of being well filled with data.

The stepped-bowl geometry features a low surface-to-volume ratio compared to the baseline bowl, which is considered beneficial for low heat losses.

For this reason, print media was revolutionary at the time. However, with the more recent electronic revolution, the importance of print began to decline, as discussed below.|$|R
