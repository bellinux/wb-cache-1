[...] "You {{seem to have}} had enough {{asparagus}} and strawberries every day for {{at least half a dozen}} people. As for the butcher, I am going this afternoon to tell him exactly what I think of him. And there are several matters here," [...] she went on, [...] "concerning which you must really talk to the cook yourself. For instance--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What are {{you going}} to do with Little Dorrit? Is she to come to work here for ever? To come to tea here for ever? To come {{backwards}} and forwards here, in the same way, for ever?' 'How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> [...] "for ever" [...] to a maimed creature like me?

5000|$|The film {{opens with}} the passage [...] "Friendship is friendship; history is history." [...] Mou said of the quote, [...] "that's the {{argument}} had with the Chinese government, because the government says 'no, we have a friendship with the Japanese', I said 'well, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> your friendship, I am <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> history.'" ...|$|R

[...] She turned to me. [...] "Do you know, when some Dutch people came here to buy Dirk's pictures he tried to persuade them to buy Strickland's? He insisted on bringing them here to show." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bows was {{speaking}} beside the question, and Pen had his advantage here, {{which he was}} not sorry to take--not sorry to put off the debate from the point upon which his adversary had first engaged it. Arthur broke out {{with a sort of}} laugh, for which he asked Bows's pardon. [...] "Yes, I am an aristocrat," [...] he said, [...] "in a palace up three pair of stairs, with a carpet nearly as handsome as yours, Mr. Bows. My life is passed in grinding the people, is it?--in ruining virgins and robbing the poor? My good sir, this is very well in a comedy, where Job Thornberry slaps his breast, and asks my Lord how dare he trample on an honest man and poke out an Englishman's fireside; but in real life, Mr. Bows, to a man who has to work for his bread as much as you do--how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> aristocrats tyrannising over the people? Have I ever done you a wrong? or assumed airs of superiority over you? Did you not have an early regard for me--in days when we were both of us romantic young fellows, Mr. Bows?

"The thing that's so appalling {{to me is}} {{that the}} President, when this whole idea was {{suggested}} to him, didn't, in righteous indignation, rise up and say, 'Get out of here, you're {{in the office of the}} President of the United States. How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> blackmail and bribery and keeping witnesses silent? This is the Presidency of the United States.' But my President didn't do that. He sat there and he worked and worked to try to cover this thing up so it wouldn't come to light." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{promote his}} film The Love Letter, Selleck {{was invited to}} be on The Rosie O'Donnell Show on May 19, 1999. Unexpectedly, he found himself {{defending}} an ad in which he appeared supporting the National Rifle Association (NRA) and his position on gun ownership.

How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> peace and love and have a family in bits and pieces—no communication, adultery, divorce? You can't do it, not if you're being true and honest with yourself." ...|$|E
5000|$|A piece such as tlakwa {{speaks to}} a more {{ambiguous}} kind of oppression, whereby matrices of race, power and servility are made visible in something as seemingly innocuous as a commemorative coin. Robert Enright, curator of a survey show of Drever's work entitled, Everything {{is going to be}} OK again soon, says of Drever: [...] "Dean’s main interests are issues of power, violence and racism. Those are pretty heavy topics, but we believe art is serious business and if you can’t talk about some of our greatest challenges and the things that influence most directly as a society with art, how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it? Art is free to talk about everything." ...|$|E

At the end of ethics what use is radical performance?

50|$|It's an irritating {{reality that}} many places and events defy description. Angkor Wat and Machu Picchu, for instance, seem to demand silence, like {{a love affair}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> For a while after, you fumble for words, trying vainly to {{assemble}} a private narrative, an explanation, a comfortable way to frame where you've been and what's happened.

Following the April 2011 Cairo agreement, he ruled out a peace agreement, if Fatah and Hamas would reconcile. He said: ″The PA must choose either peace with Israel or peace with Hamas. There is no possibility for peace with both″ and ″How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> to us <b>about</b> peace when you're <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> peace with Hamas. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> choose make peace with Israel or <b>you</b> <b>can</b> choose peace with Hamas″.|$|R

They seem to me little ruffians, who take an unnatural delight in killing and tormenting birds, and insects, and kittens, and {{whatever}} is weaker than themselves. But you are so different I am quite fond of you.

30|$|I {{think the}} {{students}} for whom I take credit, all had that attitude. They all had some notion {{they were going}} to do something. They were not particularly interested in what I wanted them to do, but they would <b>talk</b> to me. <b>You</b> have to drink wine with someone for four years before <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> seriously <b>about</b> anything. To <b>talk</b> seriously, <b>you</b> have to put yourself on the line and you have to really care and so on.

It's all about the passion. It's all about great ideals compromised by falling in love with the wrong person." [...] Chibnall also stated that the story had a special relevance for today's world because it dealt with the promise of world leaders to create a better world, and then trying to carry through on their promises.|$|R
