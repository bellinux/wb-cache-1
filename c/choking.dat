The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.|$|E
5|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, Kanō combined the throwing {{techniques of the}} Kitō-ryū and the <b>choking</b> and pinning techniques of the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū. As such, judo's Koshiki no Kata preserves the traditional forms of the Kitō-ryū with only minor differences from the mainline tradition. Similarly, many of the techniques (but not the forms) of the Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū are preserved in the Kime no Kata.|$|E
50|$|The barrels come {{threaded}} with a Tru-Choke thread {{pattern and}} two flush-mount spreader <b>choke</b> tubes. There are two optional <b>chokes</b> from the manufacturer, the doorbuster tactical <b>choke</b> and stiletto <b>choke.</b>|$|R
50|$|The MP-153 is {{manufactured}} with fixed <b>choke</b> {{available as}} Cylinder, Modified or Full variants, or with screw in <b>chokes</b> with Cylinder, Improved Cylinder, Modified, Improved Modified, Full and Extra Full variants available. Normally there are 3 or 4 <b>chokes</b> included with multi <b>choke</b> variants of the shotgun and a spanner that duplicates as a <b>choke</b> extractor and gas screw adjustor. Screw in <b>chokes</b> come as lead or steel proofed versions.|$|R
50|$|A <b>choke</b> {{connection}} is formed by mating one <b>choke</b> flange and one cover (or gasket/cover) flange. The central {{region of the}} <b>choke</b> flange face is very slightly recessed {{so that it does}} not touch the face of the cover flange, but is separated from it by a narrow gap. The recessed region is bounded by a deep <b>choke</b> trench (or ditch or groove) cut into the face of the flange. <b>Choke</b> flanges are only used with rectangular waveguide, and are invariably pressurizable, having a gasket groove encircling the <b>choke</b> ditch. The presence of these two concentric circular grooves makes <b>choke</b> flanges easily recognizable. The left-hand flange in figure 2 is a <b>choke</b> flange.|$|R

Louis later abused her, <b>choking</b> her to unconsciousness, to which she responded by throwing scalding water at him. For violating court orders to stay away from Mamie, Louis Till was forced by a judge in 1943 to choose between jail or enlisting in the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|Phosphoryl {{chloride}} (commonly called phosphorus oxychloride) is a {{colourless liquid}} with the formula 3. It hydrolyses in moist air releasing phosphoric acid and <b>choking</b> fumes of hydrogen chloride. It is manufactured industrially {{on a large}} scale from phosphorus trichloride and oxygen or phosphorus pentoxide. It is mainly used to make phosphate esters such as tricresyl phosphate.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} match saw Nakano challenging Blayze for the Women's Championship. Nakano {{used her}} size to perform such moves as leg drops and several submission holds. Blayze countered with aerial maneuvers like a hurricanrana and a spinning heel kick. Vachon got involved by <b>choking</b> Blayze while Nakano distracted the referee. The match ended when Nakano missed a diving leg drop, allowing Blayze to pin {{her for the}} win.|$|E

5000|$|Chokeholds can {{be divided}} into two primary categories: [...] "blood chokes" [...] and [...] "air chokes". A blood <b>choke</b> {{disrupts}} blood circulation to the brain, while an air <b>choke</b> disrupts breathing.

5|$|The second {{match of}} the {{broadcast}} pitted Nailz against Virgil. Nailz spent {{the majority of the}} match <b>choking</b> Virgil. Virgil recovered several times and performed several offensive maneuvers, but Nailz always regained the advantage. Ultimately, Nailz won the match by performing a sleeper hold. After the match, he attacked Virgil with a nightstick.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff faced Smackdown General Manager Theodore Long (with Palmer Canon). Two referees from each show officiated the match. Theodore Long, began by {{avoiding}} Eric's attacks. As Canon climbed on the apron, and distracted the referees, Bischoff used his obi to choke Long. Bischoff continued <b>choking</b> Long and applied the sleeper hold. Cannon distracted the referees again as Long hit Bischoff with his shoe. The Boogeyman's music played with Bischoff sending the referees {{up the ramp}} to stop him. The Boogeyman delivered a pumphandle slam to Bischoff and Long pinned Bischoff to win the match.|$|E

Empty bottles of the prescription drug Carisoprodol and a partially consumed bottle of alcohol were found nearby. He had recently received divorce papers from his wife. His death, caused by <b>choking</b> on his own vomit, was officially ruled a suicide. He was buried in China Grove in Rowan County, North Carolina.|$|E
5000|$|In firearms, a <b>choke</b> is a tapered {{constriction}} of {{a shotgun}} barrel's bore at the muzzle end. <b>Chokes</b> {{are almost always}} used with modern hunting and target shotguns, to improve performance. Its purpose is to shape {{the spread of the}} shot in order to gain better range and accuracy. [...] <b>Chokes</b> are implemented as either screw-in <b>chokes,</b> selected for particular applications, or as fixed, permanent <b>chokes,</b> integral to the shotgun barrel.|$|R

They use <b>CHOKe</b> hits, <b>CHOKe</b> misses and/or CHOKe-RED drops to carry out these tasks. In this paper we investigate the accuracy of malicious flow detection by using these hits, misses and drops (using ns- 2). We also point out the unreliability of <b>CHOKe</b> hits and misses, when compared to CHOKe-RED drops, as they affect TCP-friendly flows adversely. By doing so, we present two variations of <b>CHOKe</b> called Half 1 and Half 2 to improve <b>CHOKe</b> and compare them with <b>CHOKe.</b> Half 1 and Half 2 outperform <b>CHOKe</b> when the combined rates of malicious flows are less or greater than the link capacity respectively...|$|R
5000|$|An air <b>choke</b> or {{tracheal}} <b>choke</b> specifically {{refers to}} a [...] "true" [...] <b>choke</b> that compresses the upper airway (trachea, larynx or laryngopharynx), hence interfering with breathing, and leading to asphyxia. Although less effective at inducing unconsciousness than its vascular counterpart, the air <b>choke</b> causes excruciating pain and air hunger, and in combat sports a fighter will usually submit to such a submission hold. Air <b>chokes</b> {{have been associated with}} fractures of the larynx or hyoid bone, and are considered less safe than blood <b>chokes</b> to practice. The arm bar <b>choke</b> is an air <b>choke</b> done by placing the forearm across the front of the neck from behind. The free hand grabs the wrist and pulls back the forearm, hence driving the forearm (usually the radius bone) into the front of the neck.|$|R
5|$|The basic close combat from {{previous}} installments has been heavily refined and expanded into the CQC system. When unarmed or using a one-handed weapon, Snake can grab opponents {{and put them}} in a chokehold, at which point a variety of actions can be performed, such as <b>choking</b> the enemy unconscious, slitting the enemy's throat, or interrogating them at knifepoint to obtain information. The context, pressure applied to the button, and movement of the analog stick determine the action performed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} {{his major}} league career, Martin {{returned}} to the minor leagues, serving as a player-manager with the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League in 1945 and 1946 before becoming the player-manager for the Greenville Spinners of the South Atlantic League in 1947. His fiery, competitive nature was still evident in July 1945 when it was reported that he had punched one of his players for not performing to his standards. While managing the Miami Sun Sox of the Florida International League in 1949, he was fined and suspended {{for the remainder of the}} season for <b>choking</b> an umpire. In August 1951, he made news again when he was arrested after a Sun Sox game when he went into the stands to punch a spectator in Lakeland, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause <b>choking</b> and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
50|$|For older {{shotguns}} {{having only}} one fixed <b>choke,</b> intended primarily for equally-likely use against rabbits, squirrels, quail, doves, and pheasant, an often-chosen <b>choke</b> is the improved cylinder, in a 28 in barrel, making the shotgun {{suitable for use}} as a general all-round hunting shotgun, without having excess weight. Shotguns having fixed <b>chokes</b> intended for geese, in contrast, are often found with full <b>choke</b> barrels, in longer lengths, and are much heavier, being intended for fixed use within a blind against distant targets. Defensive shotguns with fixed <b>chokes</b> generally have a cylinder bore <b>choke.</b> Likewise, shotguns intended primarily for use with slugs invariably also are found with a <b>choke</b> that is a cylinder bore.|$|R
5000|$|In practice, <b>choke</b> tubes {{tighter than}} [...] "Full", such as [...] "Turkey", are also {{commonly}} marked with {{but a single}} thin notch {{on the end of}} the tube. Hence, to distinguish between [...] "Full" [...] vs. even tighter <b>chokes,</b> such as [...] "Turkey", it becomes necessary to measure the bore exit diameter of the <b>choke</b> tube to determine precisely which <b>choke</b> type is present among the [...] "Full" [...] and tighter (smaller diameter) <b>chokes.</b>|$|R

Scully successfully resuscitates Lisa. Jason confronts his elderly self in the computer mainframe room at the cryogenic lab, where the old man has erased all of Jason's files from the computer. The old man tells Jason that the success of their research made time travel possible, but also plunged the world into chaos. Jason lunges at the old man, <b>choking</b> him. Wrapping his arms around his younger self, the old man bursts into flames, and the fire consumes them both. Later, Lisa sets to work at the cryonics lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.|$|E
5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of <b>choking.</b> Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 2010, CBC News Network's The Fifth Estate {{broadcast}} {{a documentary about}} the case titled Out of Control. In the documentary, reporter Hana Gartner describes Smith as a fourteen-year-old placed in a youth facility for one month in 2003 after throwing crabapples at the mailman. Smith was placed in solitary confinement after disruptive behaviour on her first day. Her initial one-month sentence would last almost four years, entirely in isolation, until her death in 2007. Often violent and unpredictable, her behaviours and the force required to intervene were always filmed and recorded, then listed on daily logs. Behaviour that Smith exhibited included many attempts at <b>choking</b> herself into unconsciousness; guards responding were often attacked by Smith, sometimes with weapons she had manufactured and concealed.|$|E
50|$|Arm {{triangle}} <b>choke,</b> side <b>choke,</b> or {{head and}} arm <b>choke</b> are generic terms describing blood chokeholds {{in which the}} opponent is strangled in between {{his or her own}} shoulder and the practitioner's arm. This is as opposed to the regular triangle <b>choke,</b> which denotes a chokehold using the legs, albeit with a similar mechanism of strangulation against the opponent's own shoulder. An arm triangle <b>choke</b> where the practitioner {{is on the side of}} the opponent and presses a forearm into the opposite side of the neck of the opponent is known as a side <b>choke,</b> such as from the kata-gatame hold.|$|R

5|$|Some of the city's necessities such as coal {{arrived by}} barge, but most came by road. Carts, carriages, horses and {{pedestrians}} were crowded {{together and the}} gateways in the wall formed bottlenecks through which {{it was difficult to}} progress.

The poor walked, and might be splashed by the wheeled vehicles and drenched by slops being thrown out and water falling from the overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the <b>choking</b> black smoke belching forth from factories which made soap, from breweries and iron smelters and from about 15,000 houses burning coal.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{altitude}} {{site where}} D.regia is found is characterised by permanently damp soils consisting mostly of a gravel bench formed from a creek bed. The plants grow in a peaty quartzite sand, {{often with a}} gravel cover. Rhizomes of mature plants grow above ground and among associated grasses and sedges when gravel is absent and below ground {{when there is a}} gravel cover present. Associated vegetation included species of Leucadendron and members of the families Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, and Restionaceae. The habitat of D.regia depends on periodic fire sweeping through and keeping the larger plants from <b>choking</b> out D.regia. Frost occurs infrequently in the valley.|$|E
5|$|Weight {{loss and}} eating {{difficulties}} due to dysphagia and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly {{important as the}} disease advances. Thickening agents {{can be added to}} liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent <b>choking.</b> If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is available. This is a feeding tube, permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, which reduces the risk of aspirating food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by speech-language pathologists with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Chokes</b> may {{be formed}} {{at the time}} of {{manufacture}} either as part of the barrel, by squeezing the end of the bore down over a mandrel, or by threading the barrel and screwing in an interchangeable <b>choke</b> tube. <b>Chokes</b> may also be formed even after a barrel is manufactured by increasing the diameter of the bore inside a barrel, creating what is called a [...] "jug choke", or by installing screw-in <b>chokes</b> within a barrel. However implemented, a <b>choke</b> typically consists of a conical section that smoothly tapers from the bore diameter down to the <b>choke</b> diameter, followed by a cylindrical section of the <b>choke</b> diameter. Briley Manufacturing, one maker of interchangeable shotgun <b>chokes,</b> uses a conical portion about 3 times the bore diameter in length, so that the shot is gradually squeezed down with minimal deformation. The cylindrical section is shorter, usually 0.6 to 0.75 inches (15 to 19 mm).|$|R
