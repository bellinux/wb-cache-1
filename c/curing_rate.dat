50|$|Urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins are dominantly used in {{the medium}} density {{fiberboard}} (MDF) industry because of their low cost and fast curing characteristics. However, pressures {{on the use of}} UF resins are mounting steadily due to potential problems associated with formaldehyde emission. On the other hand, phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins are more durable and do not emit formaldehyde after cure. The industry has traditionally shied away from using PF resins due primarily to their higher cost and much slower <b>curing</b> <b>rate</b> than UF resins. However, the press times for PF-bonded fiberboard can be substantially reduced by manipulating the fiber mat temperatures, molecular weight distribution of PF resins and pressing parameters. As a result, the press times for PF-bonded fiberboard can be made comparable to those for UF-bonded fiberboard. Also, the resin content required for PF-bonded fiberboard is less than 5% to achieve a good board quickly. This is considerably lower than that required for UF-bonded fiberboard.|$|E
50|$|Paint {{has four}} major {{components:}} pigments, binders, solvents, and additives. Pigments serve to give paint its color, texture, toughness, {{as well as}} determining if a paint is opaque or not. Common white pigments include titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Binders are the film forming component of a paint as it dries and affects the durability, gloss, and flexibility of the coating. Polyurethanes, polyesters, and acrylics are all examples of common binders. The solvent is the medium in which all other components of the paint are dissolved and evaporates away as the paint dries and cures. The solvent also modifies the <b>curing</b> <b>rate</b> and viscosity of the paint in its liquid state. There {{are two types of}} paint: solvent-borne and water-borne paints. Solvent-borne paints use organic solvents as the primary vehicle carrying the solid components in a paint formulation, whereas water-borne paints use water as the continuous medium. The additives that are incorporated into paints are a wide range of things which impart important effects on the properties of the paint and the final coating. Common paint additives are catalysts, thickeners, stabilizers, emulsifiers, texturizers, biocides to fight bacterial growth, etc.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} studying the relationship between rubber mixing processes and curing characteristics of natural rubber. The curing characteristic analysis was carried out through a natural rubber formula having been masticated and mixed, followed by curing. As many as four mastication methods were finely applied; each respected four sequences of rubber mixing process. In the first method, rubber was masticated for 5 minutes and then rubber chemicals and carbon black N 330 were simultaneously added. In the second and the third methods, rubber was masticated for 1 minute and then carbon blacks and rubber chemicals were also simultaneously added but using different type of fillers. In the fourth method, rubber was masticated for 3 minutes and then rubber chemicals and carbon black were subsequently added. The additions of rubber chemicals and carbon blacks to the masticated rubber were distinguished by the sequence and time allocated for each mixing process. The carbon blacks were added in two stages by which 10 phr was added first and the remaining 40 phr was added later along with oil. In another method, ratios of the carbon blacks addition (as done {{in the first and}} the second stages) were 20 : 30, 30 : 20, and 40 : 10. The examination results showed that rubber mixing process gave an impact on the changes of curing characteristics. They were much affected by the method of carbon black addition. The mixing temperature also had an effect on both curing time and <b>curing</b> <b>rate</b> in which the higher the mixing temperature, the lower the curing time and <b>curing</b> <b>rate.</b> Vulcanizationtemperature also affected the curing time and <b>curing</b> <b>rate</b> in which the higher the vulcanization temperature, the lower the curing time and the higher the <b>curing</b> <b>rate.</b> Lastly, particle size of carbon black also gave an impact on the curing time and <b>curing</b> <b>rate</b> in which the smaller the particle size, the lower the curing time and the higher the <b>curing</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground and Objectives: Immunologic {{rejection}} of the transplanted cornea is the major cause of human allograft failure with several risk factors contributing to it. Since in the corneal graft, most individuals do not reject the graft, we used the survival analysis with <b>cure</b> <b>rate</b> {{for the assessment of}} the factors influencing the <b>cure</b> <b>rate</b> at the time of data analysis. The main aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the <b>cure</b> <b>rate</b> and assess the risk factors for corneal graft rejection in the keratoconus disease in Labafinejad Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Methods: This was a routine data base study in which the data were gathered from keratoconus patients’ files that had undergone penetrating keratoplasty operation. In the survival analysis, individuals who didn’t reject corneal were considered cured. To study the factors influencing the <b>cure</b> <b>rate,</b> we used the Weibull distribution for survival function and the logistic link function for the <b>cure</b> <b>rate</b> because of their tractability and accuracy. Results: Out of 119 patients 31 patients (26 %) rejected grafts. Among the factors influencing <b>cure</b> <b>rate,</b> only in vascularization and in persons older than 25 years of age was ameaningful effect on decreasing <b>cure</b> <b>rate.</b> With this <b>cure</b> model, the expected <b>cure</b> <b>rate</b> in the non-vascularization and less than 25 year- old patients was 81, in non-vascularization and more than 25 year- olds it is 64, in the vascularization and less than 25 year- olds, the <b>cure</b> <b>rate</b> is 19 and in the vascularization and more than 25 years of age, the <b>cure</b> <b>rate</b> is 9 percent and the observed <b>cure</b> <b>rate</b> for Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator was 79, 61, 27 and 0 percent, respectively. The results showed that the estimate of <b>cure</b> <b>rate</b> in the survival analysis was near the Kaplan-Meier product-limits estimator. Conclusion: One of the benefits of modeling is its ability to generalize the results; using them in the prediction. According to the results obtained from the fitting cure model the vascularization is a major risk factor for decreasing <b>cure</b> <b>rate</b> in the keratoconus disease. We could use the <b>cure</b> <b>rate</b> model in the analysis of survival data with cure fraction. Keywords: Corneal Graft Rejection; Keratoconus; Survival Analysis; <b>Cure</b> <b>Rate...</b>|$|R

Based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible model, we solve an optimization problem as how best to allocate the limited resources so as to minimize the prevalence, providing that the <b>curing</b> <b>rate</b> of each node is positively correlated to its medical resource. By quenched mean-field theory and heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) theory, we prove that epidemic outbreak will be suppressed to the greatest extent if the <b>curing</b> <b>rate</b> of each node is directly proportional to its degree, under which the effective infection rate λ has a maximal threshold λ_c^opt= 1 /〈 k 〉 where 〈 k 〉 is average degree of the underlying network. For weak infection region (λ≳λ_c^opt), we combine a perturbation theory with Lagrange multiplier method (LMM) to derive the analytical expression of optimal {{allocation of}} the curing rates and the corresponding minimized prevalence. For general infection region (λ>λ_c^opt), the high-dimensional optimization problem is converted into numerically solving low-dimensional nonlinear equations by the HMF theory and LMM.
