The other, damaged, tooth is 9.8mm high and {{has at least one}} deep cavity (infundibulum). Characters shared by the teeth of Lavanify and Bharattherium include the presence of an infundibulum and a furrow; they both also have large, continuous bands of matrix (unbundled hydroxyapatite crystals) between the prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) of the enamel, and perikymata—wave-like ridges and grooves in the enamel surface.|$|E
5|$|The first naturalists who {{investigated}} Megalosaurus mistook it for {{a gigantic}} lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842, Owen concluded {{that it was no}} longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs. He still thought it was a quadruped, though. Modern scientists, by comparing Megalosaurus with its direct relatives in the Megalosauridae, were able to obtain a more accurate picture. Megalosaurus was about seven metres long, weighing about 1.1 tonnes. It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. Megalosaurus had a rather large head, equipped with long <b>curved</b> <b>teeth.</b> It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many {{dolphins}} and whales, {{the seven}} vertebrae {{in the neck}} are not fused together, allowing the animal to turn its head laterally without needing to rotate its body. This gives the head a lateral manoeuvrability that allows an improved field of view and movement and helps in catching prey and evading predators in deep water. The rostrum has about eight to 10 small, blunt, and slightly <b>curved</b> <b>teeth</b> {{on each side of}} the jaw and a total of 36 to 40 teeth. Belugas do not use their teeth to chew, but for catching hold of their prey; they then tear them up and swallow them nearly whole. Belugas only have a single spiracle, which is located on the top of the head behind the melon, and has a muscular covering, allowing it to be completely sealed. Under normal conditions, the spiracle is closed and an animal must contract the muscular covering to open the spiracle. A beluga's thyroid gland is larger than that of terrestrial mammals – weighing three times more than that of a horse – which helps it to maintain a greater metabolism during the summer when it lives in river estuaries. It is the marine cetacean that most frequently develops hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions of the thyroid.|$|E

40|$|Here {{we report}} on a large brachyuran crab species from the Late Cretaceous of Mexico that has claws {{indicative}} of highly specialized shell-breaking behaviour. This crab possessed dimorphic claws (the right larger than the left), armed with several broad <b>teeth,</b> including a <b>curved</b> <b>tooth</b> structure found {{at the base of}} the movable finger of the right claw. The <b>curved</b> <b>tooth</b> is similar to the one observed on claws of many living durophagous crabs that use it as a weapon to peel, crush or chip the edges of hard-shelled prey, particularly molluscs. These morphological traits suggest that specialized shell-breaking crab predators had evolved during the Cretaceous, which contradicts previous findings supporting an Early Cenozoic origin for specialized shell crushers within the brachyuran clade...|$|R
5000|$|Mosasaur {{teeth are}} of rather uniform {{morphology}} with a pointed and <b>curved</b> <b>tooth</b> crown {{that sits on}} a pedicel composed of bone.

500|$|Spinosaurus gives {{its name}} to the Spinosauridae family of dinosaurs, which {{includes}} two subfamilies: Baryonychinae and Spinosaurinae. [...] The Baryonychinae include Baryonyx from southern England and Suchomimus from Niger in central Africa. The Spinosaurinae include Spinosaurus, Irritator from Brazil, and Angaturama (which is probably synonymous with Irritator) from Brazil. The Spinosaurinae share unserrated straight teeth that are widely spaced (e.g., 12 {{on one side of the}} maxilla), as opposed to the Baryonychinae which have serrated <b>curved</b> <b>teeth</b> that are numerous (e.g., 30 on one side of the maxilla).|$|E
500|$|In 2012 a third [...] "stem aetosaur" [...] was {{described}} from the Middle Triassic Manda Beds of Tanzania. It differs from other Middle Triassic pseudosuchians {{in having a}} long skull, a small antorbital fenestra that fits into a large antorbital fossa {{in front of the}} eye socket, sharp and <b>curved</b> <b>teeth,</b> and osteoderms covering much of its body. Like aetosaurs and Revueltosaurus, it has a maxilla that fits into the jugal. Revueltosaurus, Turfanosuchus, and the unnamed Tanzanian pseudosuchian are all good fits for the hypothesized ancestor of aetosaurs because they both have double rows of leaf-shaped osteoderms along their backs that could potentially have evolved into the tightly fitting paramedian osteoderms of aetosaurs.|$|E

Whereupon, staring solemnly at Nod once more, he let the leaves and stalk float onward with the stream, then with a flash and flicker of tail dived down, down, and was gone. All again was silent.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{the skull}} is only known in small, juvenile specimens. The skull was elongate, with its superior margin markedly concave upward, and slender, elongated rostrum. Its jaws had up to 18 closely spaced, long, gently <b>curving</b> <b>teeth</b> per jaw side. The anterior teeth were angled anteriorly, while the posterior teeth were shorter and more upright. The {{upper and lower}} teeth interlocked; according to Bennett (2013) they formed a basket for sieving food items from water, though {{the lack of a}} pumping mechanism suggests a function more akin to spoonbill jaws, wading with the jaws open and closing them when catching individual prey, much as in other ctenochasmatoids.|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{synthesis}} of a steering mechanism that exactly meets the requirements of Ackermann steering geometry. It starts from reviewing of the four-bar linkage, then discusses the number of points that a common four-bar linkage could precisely trace at most. After pointing out the limits of a four-bar steering mechanism, this article inves-tigates the turning geometry for steering wheels and proposes a steering mechanism with incomplete noncircular gears for vehicle by transforming the Ackermann criteria into the mechanism synthesis. The pitch curves, addendum <b>curves,</b> dedendum <b>curves,</b> <b>tooth</b> profiles and transition curves of the noncircular gears are formulated and designed.

50|$|The family Baurusuchidae {{was named}} by Brazilian {{paleontologist}} Llewellyn Ivor Price in 1945 to include Baurusuchus. In 1946, American paleontologist Edwin Harris Colbert erected the group Sebecosuchia, which united Baurusuchidae {{with the family}} Sebecidae (represented by the genus Sebecus). Both Baurusuchus and Sebecus have deep snouts and ziphodont dentitions (teeth that are serrated and laterally compressed). Other forms were later found that had a close appearance to these two genera, among them Cynodontosuchus, Stratiotosuchus, and Wargosuchus. Several features were used to unite these groups: a deep snout, a ziphodont dentition, a <b>curved</b> <b>tooth</b> row, an enlarged canine-like dentary tooth that fits into a deep notch in the upper jaw, and a groove on the lower jaw.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The rotary {{power head}} {{is the most}} {{important}} part of the cutting drill. After researching the status of the rotary power head, we invented a new decelerator—roulette <b>curve</b> profile movable <b>tooth</b> transmission, and applied it in cutting drill, we presented the rotary power head with roulette <b>curve</b> profile movable <b>tooth</b> transmission. The moving components, such as the input shaft and the output shaft, of the roulette <b>curve</b> profile movable <b>tooth</b> transmission are self-balance, so the transmission can bring about random tooth number difference. Analyzing the principle of the transmission, we create the three-dimensional modeling by using Solidworks 2010. The rotary power head with the new transmission installed is convenient in assembling and disassembling, transferring bigger torque, having a relatively small radial dimension, suitable for heavy-loaded rock drill machine...|$|R

40|$|Methods for {{accurate}} grinding of face-hobbed bevel gears {{have not been}} developed to date, the main obstacles being their epicycloidal lengthwise <b>tooth</b> <b>curve</b> and slot width taper. Grinding them while preserving their geometry would be desirable, as the epicycloidal <b>tooth</b> <b>curve</b> makes face-hobbed gears less sensitive to misalignments and deflections. To this end, we propose a method based on a flared-cup grinding wheel, whereby generated members are ground by a two-parameter enveloping process, while non-generated ones are finished by a one-parameter enveloping motion. Machine motions are synthesized exploiting the capabilities of 6 -axis hypoid generators. Interference between parts is avoided...|$|R

40|$|A novel cosine {{gear drive}} is {{presented}} in this paper. The pinion of the drive utilizes a cosine <b>curve</b> as the <b>tooth</b> profile.

The mathematical models, including the equation of the cosine tooth profile, the equation of the conjugate tooth profile and the equation {{of the line of}} action, are established based on the meshing theory. An example drive in solid model is presented and its computerized simulation is carried out. A few characteristics, such as the contact and bending stresses, the sliding coefficient and the contact ratio, of this new drive are analyzed.
