5|$|In chapter eleven, History, Wade {{demonstrates}} how genetics {{can be related}} to recorded history. An example given is the substantial genetic legacy of Genghis Khan and his male relatives. History correlates with this, as writers of the period stated that he had hundreds of wives. Wade then covers the origins of the British; contrary to popular belief, he writes, neither the Anglo-Saxons nor the Vikings eradicated the indigenous population, as the Y chromosomes common to Celtic speakers are carried by {{a large percentage of the}} male population of Britain. Markers in these Y chromosomes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the Basques, and he suggests that the British and Irish descend from a refuge in Spain they shared during the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E

5|$|Turkish {{miniature}} {{is an art}} form, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the Persian miniature tradition, as well {{as strong}} Chinese artistic influences. The words taswir or nakish were used to define the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called Nakkashanes. The miniatures were usually not signed, {{perhaps because of the}} rejection of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person; the head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours (which were called tahrir) with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of third dimension. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text, were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding of perspective was {{different from that of the}} nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture. They followed closely the context of the book they were included in, resembling more illustrations rather than standalone works of art.|$|E
5|$|Two {{versions}} of the musical score of L'incoronazione exist, both from the 1650s. The first was rediscovered in Venice in 1888, the second in Naples in 1930. The Naples score {{is linked to the}} revival of the opera in that city in 1651. Both scores contain essentially the same music, though each differs from the printed libretto and has unique additions and omissions. In each score the vocal lines are shown with basso continuo accompaniment; the instrumental sections are written in three parts in the Venice score, four parts in the Naples version, without in either case specifying the instruments. Conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt, a leading Monteverdi interpreter, refers to the contemporary practice of leaving much of a score open, to allow for differing local performance conditions. Another convention made it unnecessary to write down detail that performers would take for granted. Neither Venice nor Naples score <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>linked</b> <b>to</b> the original performance; although the Venice version is generally regarded as the more authentic, modern productions tend to use material from both.|$|E
