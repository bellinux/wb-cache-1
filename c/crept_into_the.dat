5|$|In 226 BC, the {{citizens}} of Mantinea appealed to Cleomenes to expel the Achaeans from the city. One night, he and his troops <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> citadel and removed the Achaean garrison. The king reinstated the ancient laws {{of the city and}} returned to Tegea. From Tegea, the Spartans advanced into Achaea, where Cleomenes hoped to force the League to face him in a pitched battle. Cleomenes advanced with his army to Dyme, where he was met by the entire Achaean army. In the Battle of Dyme, the Spartans routed the Achaean phalanx, killing many of the Achaeans and capturing others. Following this victory, Cleomenes captured the city of Lasium and presented it to the Elians.|$|E
5|$|The German team {{started the}} second half in a more {{positive}} mood with Jancker forcing a save from Schmeichel in the first minute of the restart. Basler was proving to be Bayern's most dangerous player, first firing a 30-yard shot towards goal and then setting up a header for Markus Babbel, who missed the ball entirely. United put together an attack when, after a healthy period of possession, Giggs sent in a cross towards Jesper Blomqvist who could only knock the ball over the bar after a desperate stretch. Another chance for Basler prompted Alex Ferguson to bring on striker Teddy Sheringham. Ottmar Hitzfeld responded with a substitution of his own, bringing on Mehmet Scholl, who immediately set up Stefan Effenberg for a long-range shot which went narrowly wide. Schmeichel kept his side in the game when tipping another Effenberg shot over the bar after 75 minutes. Scholl then almost scored from a delicate 20-yard chip after a run from Basler, but the ball bounced back off the post and {{into the arms of}} a relieved Schmeichel. With the game seemingly drifting away from the English side, Ferguson introduced striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær with 10 minutes remaining. The substitute immediately forced Kahn into a diving save with a header; it was the closest United had come to scoring all game. A minute later, Bayern missed a chance to secure the trophy when an overhead kick from Jancker came off the crossbar. As the game <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> last five minutes, United's two substitutes forced Kahn into more saves, firstly through a Sheringham volley and then from another Solskjær header.|$|E

25|$|Kolkata {{was also}} the {{workplace}} of several social reformers, like Raja Ram Mohan Ray, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Swami Vivekananda. These social reforms have eventually led to a cultural atmosphere where practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination or untouchability, the evils that <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Hindu society, were abolished.|$|E
25|$|As of January 11, 2011, over 100 {{donations}} {{inspired by}} Tiger Mask {{have been reported}} across Japan. After the two initial donations, many other orphanages and children's facilities began to receive copycat donations of backpacks. Some have also received toys, food, and money {{to help pay for}} new backpacks. In addition, parallels to other anime and manga concerning orphaned children have also <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> donation phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|While the {{influence}} of Scandinavian language was strongest in dialects in the Danelaw region and Scotland, the spoken words <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> language in the tenth and eleventh centuries near {{the transition from the}} Old to Middle English period, but such borrowed words only appeared in the Middle English writing {{at the beginning of the}} thirteenth century, likely because of a scarcity of literary texts from an earlier date.|$|E
25|$|Whilst on tour, {{the group}} {{recording}} their second studio album, Everybody. In November 2001, just {{nine months after}} the release of their debut album, Hear'Say released Everybody. The album was preceded by a single of the same name. The single debuted at number four, while the album <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chart at number 24. Everybody went on to sell just one fifth as many copies as Popstars. Despite the second album's lack of success, it did achieve Gold status by the BPI but over a decade after its release and plans were made for an arena tour but these were later cancelled.|$|E
25|$|Elements of the Zohar <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> liturgy of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the {{religious}} poets not only used the allegorism and symbolism of the Zohar in their compositions, but even adopted its style, e.g. the use of erotic terminology to illustrate the relations between man and God. Thus, {{in the language of}} some Jewish poets, the beloved one's curls indicate the mysteries of the Deity; sensuous pleasures, and especially intoxication, typify the highest degree of divine love as ecstatic contemplation; while the wine-room represents merely the state through which the human qualities merge or are exalted into those of God.|$|E

25|$|In medieval England, {{the penalty}} for {{a vast number of}} serious crimes, {{including}} murder, was death. This rule traveled with the colonists to America, and was the law in all states at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791. By then, however, a problem with the common-law mandatory death penalty had <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> legal system. If the jury has only two options—convicting a defendant of murder, where the penalty is death, or acquitting the defendant outright—it has no vehicle to express the sentiment that the defendant should be punished somehow, but not executed. Faced with this dilemma, some juries would acquit the defendant in order to spare his life. Of course, this meant that an obviously guilty person would go free.|$|E
25|$|Rowing {{onto the}} beach, the force <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> jungle but was {{discovered}} by Spanish scouts and came under heavy fire. Unable to retaliate or even protect themselves, the Americans retreated onto the beach {{only to find that}} their boats had been sunk by Spanish cannon fire. Captain Núñez died of a gunshot wound to the head, Chanler was shot in the elbow, and Abbott was shot through the right shoulder. Five Cuban soldiers were also wounded. The party took cover in a mangrove swamp and one of them, a German surgeon named Dr. Maximilian Lund swam out to the Peoria (naked and armed only with a knife to fend off sharks) to report that survivors on the beach were in need of assistance.|$|E

25|$|Topon {{has stated}} {{numerous}} {{times that the}} name Fuck the Facts was chosen, in part, as a statement about his attitude towards the music he wrote. He tried not to feel hampered by genre labels, and that {{is reflected in the}} musical style. The earlier Fuck the Facts recordings up until approximately 2000 featured a combination of grindcore and noise. Though those two genres were prominent during this era of recording, many other styles <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> music as well including death metal, electronic and even as some as diverse as disco and jazz. When Discoing the Dead was released in early 2001, it retained many of these experimental styles, paving the way for the beginning of the first incarnation of Fuck the Facts as a full band.|$|E
25|$|The album's {{front cover}} {{is taken from}} {{photographer}} Peter Sutherland's Sightings series. Sutherland has described his photograph as being a chance encounter with a wild fox that momentarily stopped and stared straight into his lens {{while he was in}} the back garden at a friend's wedding party. Lacey acknowledged that the decision to use Sutherland's fox photograph reflected a running theme of darkness and nature that had subconsciously <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> album. Additional photographs were provided by Alexa Lambros and Accardi, while Lacey worked with Jason Noto of Morning Breath Inc. on the packaging and layout of the album. Due to an increased popularity in vinyl, the band's label rush released production of the vinyl, leaving the band out of the process - with Lacey later commenting that he would have liked to have made the release differ from the CD version.|$|E
500|$|The Hands {{also became}} close friends of Cornish {{resident}} Louis Dow, a Dartmouth College professor. Frances Hand spent {{increasing amounts of}} time with Dow while her husband was in New York, and tension <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> marriage. Despite speculation, however, {{there is no evidence}} that she and Dow were lovers. Hand regretted Frances' long absences and urged her to spend more time with him, but he maintained an enduring friendship with Dow. He blamed himself for a lack of insight into his wife's needs in the early years of the marriage, confessing his [...] "blindness and insensibility to what you wanted and to your right to your own ways when they differed from mine". Fearing he might otherwise lose her altogether, Hand came to accept Frances' desire to spend time in the country with another man.|$|E

500|$|In {{a letter}} dated August 1679 Potts {{informed}} his East India Company colleague that the Siamese fleet had arrived and stressed the impending danger. The events that followed were decisive: in 1680, after a siege lasting {{more than six}} months, Singora was destroyed and abandoned. Contemporary French sources document the city's destruction and provide a wealth of detail. The head of the French East India Company's operations in Ayuthaya described how Singora's [...] "trés bonne citadelle" [...] had been razed after a war of more than thirty years; a missionary working in Ayuthaya in the mid 1680s told how the King of Siam sent his finest ships to destroy the sultanate [...] "de fond en comble" [...] (from top to bottom).

500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} {{review for}} The New York Times, Jon Pareles believed West's elevated status undermines the underdog quality that accentuated his debut album: [...] "for much of Late Registration, the striver {{has turned into}} a hip-hop V.I.P., and a cool arrogance has <b>crept</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> songs". Spin magazine's Jon Caramanica viewed that the augmented versatility and eccentricity of West's flow still [...] "pales in comparison to his sonic ambition". Hattie Collins of NME was highly impressed by the beats in the music, which she called [...] "pure cranium-crushing boom bap at its best", but lamented the lack of [...] "rubbish lyrics" [...] and clumsy charm that distinguished West's debut album. Nathan Rabin wrote in The A.V. Club that it is as ambitious but [...] "less successful" [...] than The College Dropout because of melodramatic lyrics and [...] "symphonics" [...] without a [...] "strong narrative" [...] to hold the songs together.|$|E
