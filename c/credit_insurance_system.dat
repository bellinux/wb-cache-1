40|$|Summary The {{emerging}} {{global economy}} is characterised by the virtually {{free movement of}} capital, while labour is still essentially confined to the nation state. The East Asian crisis has revealed {{the extent to which}} international financial ‘architecture’ does not yet correspond to this reality – let alone resolve its inconsistencies. The consequent public action problem is analysed in this article by first addressing the global causes of emerging market volatility and the failure of international financial institutions (such as the IMF) to contain it. The current attempt to extend multilateral bank regulation towards emerging markets is shown to suffer from severe limitations, as do proposals for mutual regulatory recognition and a global <b>credit</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>system.</b> The prospects for establishing a binding set of rules for global investment, with logical consequences for both multilateral capital taxation and international debt resolution, are improving, but remain problematic due to the ‘missing institutions’ required to create an orderly global capital market. The article concludes with an unexpected implication for the concept of citizenship itself...|$|E

30|$|Similarly, {{this study}} {{recognized}} that three additional economic variables—livestock holding, cultivated land and irrigation facility—have {{a significant positive}} impact on the rice seed selling behavior of farmers. The significant impact of livestock on households’ participation in the market might be due to its contribution to soil fertility and thereby on crop yield. There is a significant positive correlation between LSU and crop yield (r[*]=[*] 0.6, p[*]=[*] 0.02). Livestock also contribute in households’ cash income, but only 20 % of farmers have received cash income from this sub-sector indicating the linkage of livestock on seed marketing is important mainly from its contribution towards increasing rice yield through improving soil fertility. Moreover, the impact of cultivated land and irrigation facility on seed selling volume is significantly different from zero. The correlation of these variables with rice yield is also positive, which implies that farmers with higher seed production area and better irrigation facility are more likely to sell higher quantities of seed in the market. However, strategies such as timely payment for seed or provision of <b>credit</b> and <b>insurance</b> <b>system</b> could address the small farmers’ concerns, and those growing rice under rain-fed condition (Kugbei 2007).|$|R

The road map of the Five EU Presidents presented in 2015 is far from sufficient to reduce the risks of the Euro zone falling apart by Brexit type developments or new economic shocks. The EU Presidents rely too much on high international economic growth smoothing the convergence in labor productivity between EU member states, while the more likely low growth scenario shows a serious risk of the Euro-area falling apart in a chaotic way, through further divergence in labor productivity, through new Banking crises or through the popular vote in response to fiscal and labor market reform. The Presidents argue for strengthening the Banking union with an independent watchdog, with a single resolution mechanism for Bank defaults and for a European <b>credit</b> deposit <b>insurance</b> <b>system.</b> The support for these proposals is overwhelming. They also argue for more transfer of sovereignty on financial policy and for debt mutualisation (sharing of the risks of country debt among all EU countries). This is unlikely to happen, {{while at the same time}} the urgency for dealing with the drag imposed by the high debt levels of many EU countries on economic growth is high.
