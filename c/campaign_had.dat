5|$|Biden had run for {{president}} once before, but his 1988 presidential <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> lasted for only {{three and a half}} months. He had been forced to withdraw due to controversies arising over reusing other politicians' speeches without credit, and falsely recollecting parts of his academic record.|$|E
5|$|By August 1987, Biden's <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> {{begun to}} lag behind those of Michael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt, {{although}} he had still raised more funds than all candidates but Dukakis, and was seeing an upturn in Iowa polls.|$|E
5|$|The Democracy storyline is {{generally}} regarded as having concluded with the Referendum story, {{which was published in}} 1991. However, although the main Democracy <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> indeed ended, repercussions continued in the strip for years afterwards. This took three forms.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Grey Pride" [...] <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> been {{advocating for}} a Minister for Older People and its <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> had some success, with Labour Leader Ed Miliband {{appointing}} Liz Kendall as Shadow Minister for Older People.|$|R
50|$|While each <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> {{the story}} {{ultimately}} culminating {{up to the}} battle with the Emperor Worm, the three <b>campaigns</b> <b>have</b> subplots revolving around each faction's intents to conquer Arrakis.|$|R
5000|$|The UKCP's <b>campaign</b> work <b>has</b> {{included}} {{collaboration with}} NICE and the Health Professions Council. <b>Campaigns</b> <b>have</b> included: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{king had}} been 'desperately short of money' in February, before the <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> begun; {{by the time}} it was over, he was left even shorter. The <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> cost at least £10,000, but had yielded nothing in booty or ransom. Henry still needed to pay his army's wages – the {{merchant}} sailors' wages alone were £500 – and with the crown now a few thousand pounds further in debt, a parliament was summoned for York. Before either finances or parliament had been resolved, the Glyndŵr Rising, which continued for the rest of Henry's reign, had begun in Wales. Henry IV's campaign into Scotland in June 1400 was to be the last one ever led by an English king in person.|$|E
5|$|The {{losses of}} the spring <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> {{weakened}} the Luftwaffe before the Battle of Britain. The service was forced to wait until it had reached acceptable levels before a main assault against the RAF could be made.|$|E
5|$|Gravel campaigned almost {{full-time}} in New Hampshire, {{the first}} primary state, following his announcement. Opinion polls of contenders for the Democratic nomination showed Gravel with 1percent or less support. By {{the end of}} March 2007, Gravel's <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> less than $500 in cash on hand against debts of nearly $90,000.|$|E
50|$|The Tanu <b>campaign</b> mode <b>has</b> the Kelika as {{eventual}} allies, and the Magha's <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> them eventually enslave the Sen-Soth.|$|R
50|$|Take Back the Land in Miami and the Chicago Anti-Eviction <b>Campaign</b> <b>have</b> both {{stated that}} their work is {{inspired}} by that of the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign. The Chicago Anti-Eviction <b>Campaign</b> <b>has</b> used the slogan 'No House No Vote'.|$|R
50|$|The <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> four phases.|$|R
5|$|In 2015 Hewson {{signed an}} open letter which the ONE <b>Campaign</b> <b>had</b> been {{collecting}} signatures for; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they serve {{as the head of}} the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa respectively, which will start to set the priorities in development funding before a main UN summit in September 2015 that will establish new development goals for the generation.|$|E
5|$|Lowell Reese, of Kentucky Roll Call, {{reported}} on September 28, 2015, that the Comer <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> {{leaked to the}} Herald-Leader emails showing that the husband of Crosbie had {{been in contact with}} the blogger. By doing so, the campaign was able to deny the allegations of abuse that had circulated for months in Frankfort, the state capital, and put Heiner's campaign on the defensive.|$|E
5|$|Reporters deemed Harding {{unlikely}} to be nominated due to his poor showing in the primaries, and relegated him to a place among the dark horses. Harding, who like the other candidates was in Chicago supervising his <b>campaign,</b> <b>had</b> finished sixth in the final public opinion poll, behind the three main candidates as well as former justice Hughes and Herbert Hoover, and only slightly ahead of Coolidge.|$|E
50|$|Videos parodying the Get a Mac <b>campaign</b> <b>have</b> been {{published}} online by Novell, to promote Linux, {{represented by a}} young and fashionable woman. A different set of videos parodying the <b>campaign</b> <b>have</b> been produced, but with Linux portrayed as a typical male nerd.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{disinfection}} <b>campaigns</b> <b>have</b> {{long been}} halted, {{the area is}} known to have a very active mosquito season. However, in 2014, disinfection <b>campaigns</b> <b>have</b> started and a park rehabilitation project has been initiated by the national authorities. It included a hunting moratorium which revived bird-watching activities.|$|R
25|$|Since 2008, Jordin's <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> raised over $500,000.|$|R
5|$|Army Group South's Donets <b>Campaign</b> <b>had</b> {{cost the}} Red Army some 70,000–80,000 {{personnel}} casualties. Of these troops lost, an estimated 45,200 {{were killed or}} went missing, while another 41,200 were wounded. Between April and July 1943, the Red Army took its time to rebuild its forces {{in the area and}} prepare for an eventual renewal of the German offensive, known as the Battle of Kursk. Overall German casualties are more difficult to come by but clues are provided by examining the casualties of the SS Panzer Corps, taking into consideration that the Waffen-SS divisions were frequently deployed where the fighting was expected to be the harshest. By 17 March, it is estimated that the SS Panzer Corps had lost around 44% of its fighting strength, including around 160 officers and about 4,300 enlisted personnel.|$|E
5|$|As {{a treaty}} {{document}} {{with a foreign}} nation, the Tyler-Texas annexation treaty required {{the support of a}} two-thirds majority in the Senate for passage. But in fact, when the Senate voted on the measure on June 8, 1844, fully two-thirds voted against the treaty (16–35). The vote went largely along party lines: Whigs had opposed it almost unanimously (1–27), while Democrats split, but voted overwhelmingly in favor (15–8). The election <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> hardened partisan positions on Texas among Democrats. Tyler had anticipated that the measure would fail, due largely to the divisive effects of Secretary Calhoun's Packenham letter. Undeterred, he formally asked the House of Representatives to consider other constitutional means to authorize passage of the treaty. Congress adjourned before debating the matter.|$|E
5|$|British General John Burgoyne moved {{south from}} the {{province}} of Quebec in June 1777 {{to gain control of}} the upper Hudson River valley. His <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> become bogged down in difficulties following a victory at Fort Ticonderoga. Elements of the army had reached the upper Hudson as early as the end of July, but logistical and supply difficulties delayed the main army at Fort Edward. One attempt to alleviate these difficulties failed when nearly 1,000 men were killed or captured at the August 16 Battle of Bennington. Furthermore, news reached Burgoyne on August 28 that St. Leger's expedition down the Mohawk River valley had turned back after the failed Siege of Fort Stanwix.|$|E
50|$|Since, other <b>campaigns</b> <b>have</b> {{used this}} protest method.|$|R
50|$|Prominent Institute <b>campaigns</b> <b>have</b> been to 'Teach the Controversy' and {{to allow}} 'Critical Analysis of Evolution'. Other <b>campaigns</b> <b>have</b> claimed that {{intelligent}} design advocates (most notably Richard Sternberg) have been discriminated against, and thus that Academic Freedom bills are needed to protect academics' and teachers' ability to criticise evolution, {{and that there is}} a link from evolution to ideologies such as Nazism and eugenics. These three claims are all publicised in the pro-ID movie Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed. Other <b>campaigns</b> <b>have</b> included petitions, most notably A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism.|$|R
25|$|Activists of the {{movement}} have been attacked and jailed by the government, and the <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> had to extend its two-year target to collect the full number of signatures.|$|R
5|$|By October 1988, the <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> secured ballot {{access in}} 46 {{states and the}} District of Columbia, and {{newspapers}} across the nation began running editorials and letters supporting Paul's run, and criticizing the low volume of media coverage. The New York Times chronicled Paul's campaign in late October. Paul's 25-year-old son, Rand Paul {{who served as the}} aide-de-camp, was interviewed and explained that Paul had raised $2 million, $500,000 of which was spent on ballot access. Paul had spent $40,000 a month on traveling expenses. Just prior to Election Day, Paul predicted a low voter turnout.|$|E
5|$|By October Axis {{operational}} objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were achieved, {{with only the}} sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing. A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive. Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential. The blitzkrieg phase {{of the war in}} Europe had ended.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas' army of 480 men was {{not large}} enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a {{campaign}} of psychological warfare, which would present Castillo Armas' victory as a fait accompli to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The propaganda <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> begun well before the invasion, with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> {{recently}} been launched to bring Great Yarmouth Station up-to-date. The [...] "Fix Great Yarmouth Station" [...] <b>campaign</b> <b>has</b> been created to bring one of Norfolk's popular sea-side towns' railway {{station in the}} 21st century. Spencer McCormack, of BWell gyms, who has helped to co-ordinate the <b>campaign,</b> which <b>has</b> attracted more than 3,000 pledges of support since it was launched in February, said plans were progressing for a volunteer day on 19 June.|$|R
50|$|The Plain English <b>Campaign</b> <b>has</b> its {{headquarters}} in the town.|$|R

5|$|For the U.S. Air Force, {{this success}} was {{achieved}} by conducting a shoestring operation, one that was fourth in priority for American air assets behind operations in South Vietnam, Operation Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger. After the close-out of aerial operations over North Vietnam, Barrel Roll still remained in last place. During its existence the <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> utilized an average of only {{ten percent of the}} Air Force's tactical air effort in Southeast Asia. During the 1972 Nguyen Hue PAVN offensive, the number of airstrikes over northern Laos was reduced to only five percent of the total.|$|E
5|$|Grafton {{and three}} of her sisters were {{transferred}} to the Western Approaches Command at Plymouth in October. The following month, however, the ship was reassigned {{at the end of}} the month to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla in Harwich of the Nore Command for patrol and escort duties. On 10 January 1940, she was transferred to the reconstituted 1st Destroyer Flotilla, also based at Harwich, where Grafton inspected ships travelling between German and Dutch ports for contraband. Between 26 March and 14 April the ship was given a brief overhaul in Hull in the shipyard of Brigham and Cowan. As the Norwegian <b>Campaign</b> <b>had</b> begun while Grafton was refitting, she was reassigned to the Home Fleet where she escorted convoys to Norway until 11 May.|$|E
5|$|However, Henry's army never progressed {{further than}} Leith; there the army could keep in {{physical}} {{contact with the}} supporting fleet. Henry took a personal interest in his convoys, at one point even verbally instructing that two Scottish fishermen fishing in the Firth of Forth were to be paid £2 for their (unspecified) assistance. However, Henry never besieged Edinburgh Castle where the Duke of Rothsay was ensconced. By now, Brown says, Henry's <b>campaign</b> <b>had</b> {{been reduced to a}} 'war of words.' By 29 August, the English army had returned {{to the other side of}} the border.|$|E

Services like CallFire are used by local and state candidates and issue-oriented political campaigns to reach potential voters.
