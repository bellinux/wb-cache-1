5|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century, sugar was {{purchased}} in loaves, {{which had to be}} cut using implements called sugar nips. In later years, granulated sugar was more usually sold in bags. Sugar <b>cubes</b> were produced in the nineteenth century. The first inventor of a process to make sugar in cube form was the Moravian Jakub Kryštof Rad, director of a sugar company in Dačice. He began sugar cube production after being granted a five-year patent for the process on January 23, 1843. Henry Tate of Tate & Lyle was another early manufacturer of sugar <b>cubes</b> at his refineries in Liverpool and London. Tate purchased a patent for sugar cube manufacture from German Eugen Langen, who in 1872 had invented a different method of processing of sugar <b>cubes.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Rubik's <b>Cube</b> {{group is}} {{constructed}} by labeling {{each of the}} 48 non-center facets with the integers 1 to 48. Each configuration of the <b>cube</b> can be represented as a permutation of the labels 1 to 48, depending on the position of each facet. Using this representation, the solved <b>cube</b> is the identity permutation which leaves the <b>cube</b> unchanged, while the twelve <b>cube</b> moves that rotate a layer of the <b>cube</b> 90 degrees are represented by their respective permutations. The Rubik's <b>Cube</b> group is the subgroup of the symmetric group [...] generated by the six permutations corresponding to the six clockwise <b>cube</b> moves. With this construction, any configuration of the <b>cube</b> reachable through a sequence of <b>cube</b> moves is within the group.

The player once again turns around colored <b>cubes</b> by jumping from cube to cube, {{trying to reach the}} displayed target pattern. Contrary to Mylstar's arcade game, each of the 50 stages has a different pattern of <b>cubes,</b> in addition to the known rule extensions in later stages.

5|$|Fez is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) puzzle platform game {{set in a}} three-dimensional (3D) world. The player-character Gomez lives peacefully on a 2D plane until he receives a red fez and witnesses the breakup of a giant, golden hexahedron that tears the fabric of spacetime and reveals a third dimension. After the game appears to glitch, reset, and reboot, the player can rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as four sides around a cube-like space. This rotation mechanic reveals new paths through the levels by connecting otherwise inaccessible platforms, and {{is the basis of}} Fez puzzles. For example, floating platforms become a solid road, discontinuous ladders become whole, and platforms that move along a track stay on course. The object of the game is to collect <b>cubes</b> and cube fragments, which accrete to restore order to the universe. In search of these <b>cubes,</b> Gomez traverses the game environment by jumping between ledges. Other platforming elements change with the level themes, including crates that activate switches, bombs that reveal passages, and pistons that launch Gomez airborne.|$|E

5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used to stir the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap <b>cubes</b> then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the <b>cubes.</b>|$|E
