25|$|Description: This study explores {{whether the}} {{spermatozoa}} of the <b>cocoon</b> <b>of</b> Allolobophora {{are derived from}} the spermathecae. This previously popular interpretation was challenged because of the discovery that the cocoons are formed during copulation. However, Foot and Strobell found that cocoons can be formed and deposited when the worms are not copulating.|$|E
25|$|Wild silks {{also tend}} to be more {{difficult}} to dye than silk from the cultivated silkworm. A technique known as demineralizing allows the mineral layer around the <b>cocoon</b> <b>of</b> wild silk moths to be removed, leaving only variability in color as a barrier to creating a commercial silk industry based on wild silks in the parts of the world where wild silk moths thrive, such as in Africa and South America.|$|E

500|$|The 430 short poems {{written by}} her, in a {{language}} that depicts her love for her divine lover [...] "Channa Mallikarjuna" [...] (lit, [...] "Beautiful Mallikarjuna", {{a name for the}} god Shiva), and the 15th-century anthology, the Sunyasampadane, are the main sources of information about her life. Her poetry is characterised by scorn for physical possessions and detachment from worldly affairs. A popular poem written by her describes the life of a silk worm which spins a cocoon, becomes entangled in the threads, and eventually dies because it cannot extricate itself [...] the silk worm is compared to a person and the silk threads, to worldly desires. In a poem of puns, the poet prays that her god, whom she describes as the [...] "Lord of fragrant Jasmines", may cut through the <b>cocoon</b> <b>of</b> desires so she may become free like a butterfly.|$|E
500|$|When the larva attains {{its maximum}} size, it pupates and {{undergoes}} metamorphosis. It makes a globular <b>cocoon</b> <b>of</b> sand or other local substrate stuck together with fine silk spun from a slender spinneret {{at the rear}} end of the body. [...] The cocoon may be buried several centimetres deep in sand. After completing its transformation into an adult insect {{over the course of}} about one month, it emerges from the case, leaving the pupal integument behind, and works its way to the surface. After about twenty minutes, the adult's wings are fully opened and it flies off in search of a mate. The adult is considerably larger than the larva as antlions exhibit the greatest disparity in size between larva and adult of any type of holometabolous insect. This is by virtue {{of the fact that the}} exoskeleton of the adult is extremely thin and flimsy, with an exceptionally low mass per unit of volume. [...] The adult typically lives for about 25 days, but some insects survive for as long as 45 days.|$|E
500|$|Z Canis Majoris is a {{star system}} a mere 300,000 years old {{composed}} of two pre-main-sequence stars—a FU Orionis star and a Herbig Ae/Be star, which has brightened episodically by two magnitudes to magnitude 8 in 1987, 2000, 2004 and 2008. The more massive Herbig Ae/Be star is enveloped in an irregular roughly spherical <b>cocoon</b> <b>of</b> dust that has an inner diameter of [...] and outer diameter of [...] The cocoon has {{a hole in it}} through which light shines that covers an angle of 5 to 10 degrees of its circumference. Both stars are surrounded by a large envelope of in-falling material left over from the original cloud that formed the system. Both stars are emitting jets of material, that of the Herbig Ae/Be star being much larger—11.7 light-years long. Meanwhile, FS Canis Majoris is another star with infra-red emissions indicating a compact shell of dust, but {{it appears to be a}} main-sequence star that has absorbed material from a companion. These stars are thought to be significant contributors to interstellar dust.|$|E

The empty <b>cocoon</b> <b>of</b> a caterpillar still hung in one corner, and Bud said that should be her hammock with a curtain made of woven yellow bindweed hung before the nook. They swept the floor with fir-needle brooms, and spread a carpet of red oak leaves, which gave a very gay air to the place.

60|$|Poor little Penny! {{the days}} were so very long among the daisies on a grazing farm, and thought is so active--how was it {{possible}} that the inward drama should not get the start of the outward? I have known young ladies, much better educated, and with an outward world diversified by instructive lectures, to say nothing of literature and highly-developed fancy-work, who have spun a <b>cocoon</b> <b>of</b> visionary joys and sorrows for themselves, just as Penny did. Her elder sister Letitia, who had a prouder style of beauty, and a more worldly ambition, was engaged to a wool-factor, who came all the way from Cattelton to see her; and everybody knows that a wool-factor takes a very high rank, sometimes driving a double-bodied gig. Letty's notions got higher every day, and Penny never dared to speak of her cherished griefs to her lofty sister--never dared to propose that they should call at Mr. Freely's to buy liquorice, though she had prepared for such an incident by mentioning a slight sore throat. So she had to pass the shop {{on the other side of}} the market-place, and reflect, with a suppressed sigh, that behind those pink and white jars somebody was thinking of her tenderly, unconscious of the small space that divided her from him.|$|E
