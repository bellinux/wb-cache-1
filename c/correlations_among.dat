25|$|There exists no theory elucidating <b>correlations</b> <b>among</b> L-amino acids. If one takes, for example, alanine, {{which has}} a small methyl group, and phenylalanine, {{which has a}} larger benzyl group, a simple {{question}} is in what aspect, L-alanine resembles L-phenylalanine more than D-phenylalanine, {{and what kind of}} mechanism causes the selection of all L-amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was L and phenylalanine was D.|$|E
25|$|A {{weighted}} graph is a graph {{in which}} a number (the weight) is assigned to each edge. Such weights might represent for example costs, lengths or capacities, depending on the problem at hand. Some authors call such a graph a network. Weighted correlation networks can be defined by soft-thresholding the pairwise <b>correlations</b> <b>among</b> variables (e.g. gene measurements). Such graphs arise in many contexts, for example in shortest path problems such as the traveling salesman problem.|$|E

25|$|Gardner {{argues that}} there is a wide range of {{cognitive}} abilities, but that there are only very weak <b>correlations</b> <b>among</b> them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a child who has more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.|$|E

The concept is in contrast to competing hypotheses including other correlational structures to explain group intelligence, such as a composition out of several equally important but independent factors as found in individual personality research.|$|E

2500|$|Pollination syndromes reflect {{convergent}} evolution towards [...] forms (phenotypes) {{that limit}} the number of species of pollinators visiting the plant. They increase the functional specialization of the plant with regard to pollination, though this may not affect the ecological specialization (i.e. the number of species of pollinators within that functional group). They are responses to common selection pressures exerted by shared pollinators or abiotic pollen vectors, which generate <b>correlations</b> <b>among</b> traits. That is, if two distantly related [...] plant species are both pollinated by nocturnal moths, for example, their flowers will converge on a form which is recognised by the moths (e.g. pale colour, sweet scent, nectar released {{at the base of a}} long tube, night-flowering).|$|E

If factors do not correlate (correlation estimates approximate zero), these rotations may produce solutions similar to orthogonal rotation. Several oblique rotation procedures are commonly used, such as direct oblimin rotation, direct quartimin rotation, promax rotation, and Harris-Kaiser orthoblique rotation. An advantage of oblique rotation {{is that it}} produces solutions with better simple structure because it allows factors to correlate, and produces estimates of <b>correlations</b> <b>among</b> factors.|$|E
