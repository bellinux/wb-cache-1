He said, “If I {{make any}} {{statement}} {{it will be}} in a way the people <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> and understand what I have to say, and not have to depend on some parts of the press which might fail to report all I have to say.” ...|$|E

If you feel like it, you can download the sound file of my new single [...] "Secret", from my new album, Bedtime Stories, which comes out next month. I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon. In the meantime, why don't you post me a message {{and let me know}} what you think of my new song. And by the way, don't believe any of those online imposters pretending to be me... ain't nothing like the real thing. Peace out.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one foot in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is you <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E

[...] "I was told before the video - and they said this very proudly, mind you - that in this line most of the girls start crying because they're hurting so bad" [...] "I couldn't breathe". [...] "I was being hit and choked". [...] "I was really upset, and they didn't stop". [...] "They kept filming". [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> say, 'Turn the fucking camera off', and they kept going". Director of the Rough Sex series Khan Tusion has commented that Starr [...] "categorically misstates what occurred." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} the Ten Year War, Michigan's {{regular season}} {{performance}} declined, but their post season performance improved. The 1979 season included a memorable game against Indiana that ended with a touchdown pass from John Wangler to Anthony Carter with six seconds left in the game. The play was made famous by Bob Ufer's emotional radio narration: [...] "Under center is Wangler at the 45, he goes back. He's looking for a receiver. He throws downfield to Carter. Carter has it. [...] Carter scores[...] [...] [...] I have {{never seen anything like this}} in all my 40 years of covering Michigan football[...] [...] [...] I hope you <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> – because I've never been so happy in all my cotton-picking 59 years! [...] [...] [...] Johnny Wangler to Anthony Carter will be heard until another 100 years of Michigan football is played! [...] [...] [...] Meeeshigan wins, 27 to 21. They aren't even going to try the extra point. Who cares? Who gives a damn?". Michigan went 84 on the season, losing to North Carolina in the 1979 Gator Bowl.|$|E
2500|$|In Michigan's eighth {{game against}} an unranked Indiana team, Wangler had his most replayed {{moment in a}} Michigan uniform. [...] Dickey started the game, and Wangler entered the game as a substitute. [...] The game was tied at 2121 in the fourth quarter. [...] There was no {{overtime}} in college football, and Michigan fans would have regarded a tie as {{the equivalent of a}} defeat. [...] With six seconds left on the clock, Michigan had the ball on the Indiana 45-yard line. [...] Wangler dropped back to pass from his own 45-yard line, and his pass hit Anthony Carter at the 23-yard line. [...] Carter ran into the end zone as time ran out to give the Wolverines a 2721 victory. [...] The play was made famous by Bob Ufer's colorful and emotional radio narration as the play unfolded. [...] A portion of Ufer's oft-replayed call follows:"Under center is Wangler at the 45, he goes back. He's looking for a receiver. He throws downfield to Carter. [...] Carter has it. [...] Carter scores[...] [...] [...] I have {{never seen anything like this}} in all my 40 years of covering Michigan football[...] [...] [...] [...] I hope you <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>me</b> – because I've never been so happy in all my cotton-picking 59 years!

2500|$|St. Elsewheres series finale {{featured}} momentous {{changes for}} several main characters, including the departures of Drs. Fiscus and Morrison {{and the death}} of Dr. Auschlander, as well as the return of Dr. Westphall to an active leadership role at St. Eligius after Ecumena agrees to sell the hospital back to the Boston archdiocese, as Dr. Gideon is set to move on to another hospital in San Jose, California. [...] The finale is more known for its provocative final scene: Westphall and his son Tommy Westphall (played by Chad Allen), who has autism, are seen in Dr. Auschlander's office watching snow falling outside. The image cuts to an exterior shot of the hospital. At that moment, Tommy and Daniel Auschlander are seen in an apartment building, with Tommy playing with a snow globe. Donald arrives home from a day of work, and {{it is clear from the}} uniform he wears and the dialog in this scene that he works in construction. [...] "Auschlander" [...] is revealed to be Donald's father, and thus Tommy's grandfather. Donald laments to his father, [...] "I don't understand this autism thing, Pop. Here's my son. I talk to him. I don't even know if he <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>me,</b> because he sits there, all day long, in his own world, staring at that toy. What's he thinking about?" [...] As Tommy shakes the snow globe, he is told by his father to come and wash his hands for dinner. Donald places the snow globe on the family's television set and walks into the kitchen with Tommy and Auschlander; as they leave the room, the camera closes in on the snow globe—which holds a replica of St. Eligius.|$|E

I will go on trying for his sake; but I know it's no good. Do what I will, I can't please her. It's my fault, I dare say, but I do try my best. I do, indeed, father," [...] he said, speaking out loud; [...] "if you <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>me,</b> I do, indeed, try to be kind to mother, but she won't let me.

I gave him information about my having two beats, you know, in my business; one day to the right from our house and back again; another day to the left from our house and back again (for he's a stranger, and don't know the names of places about here); and he seemed quite pleased. 'Why, then I shall be returning home to-night your way,' he says, 'when I thought you'd be coming in an exactly opposite direction. That's capital! I may trouble you for another lift, perhaps, but I'll engage not to fall so sound asleep again.' He was sound asleep, sure-ly!--Dot! what are you thinking of?" ...|$|E
