50|$|Attractions seen at village fêtes include tombolas, raffles, <b>coconut</b> <b>shies,</b> bat a rat stalls, white {{elephant}} stalls, cakes, and home produce such as jams and pickles. Entertainment may include Morris dancing, tug of war, fancy dress, and pet shows. The American and Canadian equivalent {{would be a}} county or city fair.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a strong}} {{sporting}} tradition within the village, with cricket and football teams making use of the green. Darts and indoor bowls are also played in the Social Club. Money is raised by an annual Sports Day which includes many stalls and events such as <b>coconut</b> <b>shies,</b> pony rides, running races and even cake competitions.|$|R
5000|$|Broomfields {{developed}} a vibrant community and social life. The living {{rooms of the}} small houses were very restricted but the chapels, church halls, public houses and the streets themselves provided ample space. Twice a year Hall Lane was [...] "en fete" [...] for the [...] "Spring Feast" [...] and [...] "Bowling Tide Week". Bowling Tide (12th Aug) week was Bradford's general holiday. All mills and factories stopped work. The [...] "Tide Field" [...] next to Hall Lane was filled by the rides and roundabouts of the travelling showmen and with stalls, <b>coconut</b> <b>shies</b> and boxing booths.|$|R

2500|$|Raymond Poulidor {{was the son}} of Martial and Maria Poulidor, {{small farmers}} outside the hamlet of Masbaraud-Mérignat, where the Creuse region east of Limoges meets the département of Haute-Vienne. He was born in the same year that his {{eventual}} directeur sportif, Antonin Magne, became world road race champion. Poulidor began working on the farm where, he remembered, [...] "the soil was poor and we had to work hard; farming incomes were poor." [...] The need for working hands on the farm meant he left school at 14 even though he wanted to continue his studies. Local entertainment went little further than village fairs, with <b>coconut</b> <b>shies,</b> sack-races, competitions for bottles of home-made jam... and inter-village cycle races.|$|R
5|$|Starting {{with a free}} plot {{of land in the}} United Kingdom and {{few hundred}} {{thousand}} pounds, the player must build a profitable amusement park. Money is spent on building rides, shops, and staff, and earned through sale of entry tickets, merchandise, and refreshments. Shops available include those selling foodstuff (such as ice creams) or soft drinks, and games such as <b>coconut</b> <b>shies</b> and arcades. Their attributes can be customised, which may affect customers' behaviour: for example, affecting the flavour of foods (e.g. by altering the amount of sugar and ice cream contains) may affect customers' enticements to return. Facilities such as toilets, and items that enhance the park's scenery (such as trees and fountains) can be purchased. Over thirty attractions, ranging in complexity from the bouncy castle and tree house to more complicated and expensive rides such as the roller coaster and Ferris wheel are available. Also available as rides are shows (called 'acts') with themes such as clowns and mediaeval. Certain rides, such as roller coasters, require a track to be laid out. The ride complement varies between platforms: for example, the PlayStation version is missing the mediaeval and dolphin shows. Rides require regular maintenance: if neglected for too long they will explode. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after it}} was built in 1898, the end of the Mumbles Pier became home to Bandstand Concerts and on the landward side was a Winter Garden both of which {{attracted}} large crowds. It was advertised by the Swansea and Mumbles Railway as 'The Prettiest Pier in the Bristol Channel' and the 'Mumbles Press' on 13 April 1911, featured the Skating Rinks as well as Hanney's Select Military Band. In the 1950s, a large entertainment center {{on the end of the}} Pier included 'Dodgems' <b>Coconut</b> <b>Shies</b> and other fairground attractions. Near the bridge to the lifeboat, two Amusement Kiosks survived from Edwardian days. The landward side of the Pier had a Cafe, with a 'Penny Slot Arcade' alongside and a popular Dance Hall was part of the 'Pier Hotel.' The amusement complex was redeveloped at the land end of the Mumbles Pier in 1966 and this proved to be a profitable attraction to visitors, resulting in the addition of a new building containing an amusement arcade, restaurant and bowling alley.The 'Mumbles Mile' is a stretch of road in Mumbles once notable for its concentration of pubs. It has long been a popular destination for pub crawls and binge drinking. Famous poet Dylan Thomas was said to have enjoyed many hours at The Mermaid. The 'Mumbles Mile' began to decline in popularity during the 1990s because of pressure from the local council and increased competition from Swansea's night attractions. Now, there are only five pubs on the 'mile', whereas there were once upwards of 20.|$|R

50|$|To {{celebrate}} the turning {{of the millennium}} in 2000, a new bench was erected opposite the War Memorial, and every summer, a fete is held in {{the grounds of the}} manor house next to the church, which includes maypole dancing, Devonshire cream teas and a <b>coconut</b> <b>shy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The village hall is {{now three}} {{times larger than}} it was and was the centrepiece of 2007's annual [...] "Jazz in the Park".

2500|$|Peter May {{rejoined the}} team {{when they came}} back to Sydney to replay New South Wales, by far the strongest state side and the match was almost played at Test level. New South Wales were sent in to bat by May on a humid day with the ball {{swinging}} and patches on the wicket thanks to poor covering against the recent rain. Frank Tyson [...] (4/55) and Brian Statham (4/36), the new ball partnership of 1954-55, showed that they could still be very dangerous. Roy Swetman dropped Watson in the first over from Tyson, but caught him off Statham for a duck. Norm O'Neill was hit on the elbow by a rising Tyson delivery and retired hurt on 37/2. Neil Harvey made another 92 and fought back with fellow left-hander Neil Marks (42) as they took the score past 150 without further loss, but Tyson came off a short run at fast-medium pace and removed Harvey, Marks, Grahame Thomas and Richie Benaud as they crashed to 171/6 before stumps. O'Neill returned {{at the start of the}} new day, but was l.b.w. to Trevor Bailey (2/40) and Statham removed the tail and New South Wales were out for 215. Gordon Rorke (4/57) removed Peter Richardson l.b.w. first ball and Tom Graveney for 14 and generated great pace off his short run, but his long drag left him only 19 yards from the batsman when he bowled and he was very difficult to play. Trevor Bailey was hit repeatedly by Rorke, but stuck in for 54 and Peter May made a powerful 136 as they added 179 for the third wicket. The captain saw off Rorke and attacked the spinners, hitting the New South Wales captain Richie Benaud for six over mid-on and cracking drives through the covers with such ferocity that four fielders could not stop him hitting the boundary. May was 99 not out on the Saturday evening and returned on the Monday, but without the same certainty. Bailey went down the pitch to Jim Burke (1/30), missed and was stumped miles out of his ground, but the crowd shouted that Burke ought to be given a <b>coconut</b> because he <b>shied</b> the ball. Rorke caught May (136) with a beautiful ball that swung from leg to hit off stump and had Willie Watson leg before, then Benaud (5/83) spun through the tail to give him 50 wickets in the season and the MCC were out for 303. There was just time for New South Wales to reach 44/0 when the rain washed out the third and fourth days.|$|R

50|$|For many years, the Stanway Flower Show {{was held}} in the hamlet - and many people {{travelled}} to visit the show. The Tithe Barn hosted the exhibits, which included flowers, vegetables and handcrafts, and there was a number of stalls - including a <b>coconut</b> <b>shy</b> and nine-pin bowling - in the grounds of Stanway House.|$|E
50|$|A <b>coconut</b> <b>shy</b> (or coconut shie) is a {{traditional}} game frequently found as a sidestall at funfairs and fêtes. The game consists of throwing wooden balls at a row of coconuts balanced on posts. Typically a player buys three balls and wins each coconut successfully dislodged. In some cases other prizes may be won instead of the coconuts.|$|E
50|$|Aunt Sally was {{traditionally}} {{played in}} pubs and fairgrounds. An Aunt Sally was originally a figurine {{head of an}} old woman with a clay pipe in her mouth, or subsequently a ball on a stick. The object was for players to throw sticks at the head in order to break the pipe. The game bears some resemblance to a <b>coconut</b> <b>shy,</b> or skittles.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an episode}} of the first series of Downton Abbey, Lady Mary Crawley and Matthew Crawley meet at a <b>coconut</b> <b>shy</b> at the village fair.

50|$|Standardised {{throwing}} sports {{typically have}} high-level competitions across regions and a sports governing body, {{with the most}} common and international varieties having a world championship and a professional circuit. Those that are less standardised in format tend not to have highly organised competition and instead are played in a more casual or social setting. Throwing games with prizes are common funfair and carnival games, with varieties including ring toss and <b>coconut</b> <b>shy</b> games.|$|E
50|$|Juan, Mama and Pedro go to {{the fair}} (but {{do not know if}} they have the right money for the <b>coconut</b> <b>shy,</b> {{roundabout}} or candy floss), while Bill is running a cake stall but Bernie cannot decide whether she wants one or not so flips four coins (1p, 2p, 5p and 10p) into the air but they do not come down again, and a cricket player wants to buy some glue from Screensaver to stick his old broken bat back together.|$|E
50|$|The larger {{of the two}} parks {{contains}} a football pitch and tennis court, and serves as the school playing field. It also plays host to the annual Drumlithie Gala, which is held on the second Saturday of June each year with raffle stalls, <b>coconut</b> <b>shy,</b> kids & adult races and lots, lots more it's a great day to visit the village. The finale of the gala is the Single vs Married Men's football match, {{which is a good}} humoured, but fiercely contested game.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{celebrates the}} <b>coconut</b> <b>shy</b> (coconut toss) at funfairs, and the catchy chorus is {{the call of}} the showman [...] "standing {{underneath}} the flare" [...] (of gaslight), inviting the public to [...] "Roll up, bowl a ball, a penny a pitch." [...] (In American editions, the line is rendered instead as, [...] "Roll or bowl a ball, a penny a pitch.") The ball is tossed or bowled (as in cricket) or pitched at the coconuts, with the object of knocking one off its stand.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} the game are unclear, but early {{references}} to it appear in the late 1800s. It probably derives from the game of Aunt Sally, with coconuts being seen as an exotic prize in the late 19th century and into the 20th century. The National Fairground Archive holds {{a photograph of a}} <b>coconut</b> <b>shy</b> dating from 1890. The game is mentioned by H. G. Wells in his book The Invisible Man in 1897, and by E. Nesbit in The Story of the Treasure Seekers in 1899. The term is first listed in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1903.|$|E
50|$|The {{show is a}} {{traditional}} family orientated country fair, and showcases a variety of competitions and events, such as the ‘Dog Factor’ dog show, falconry display, vintage car parade and much more. There is also the popular horticultural competition with dozens of categories ranging from fruit cake to roses, {{as well as a}} good number of trade and craft stalls selling their wares and providing demonstrations. The fair also has a selection of traditional side shows such as a <b>coconut</b> <b>shy,</b> plate smashing and tombolas. A barbecue, hog roast and bar provide refreshments {{for the duration of the}} event. A traditional barn dance is held on the Saturday evening to close the event.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} other {{theories}} {{of how the}} game started; one such theory is that a live cockerel {{was placed on the}} stick, and people would throw sticks at it. Whoever killed it won the game and took home the chicken. Another theory is that in Port Meadow in Oxfordshire, {{at the time of the}} English Civil War, the Cavaliers (soldiers loyal to King Charles I) were bored and formed a game with sticks and makeshift materials similar to the game as understood today. The object was for players to throw sticks at the head in order to break the pipe. The game bears some resemblance to a <b>coconut</b> <b>shy</b> or skittles.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s, it was {{reported}} that at the annual Swalwell Hopping were [...] "fairground rides such as the waltzer and carousel merry-go-round with traditional animal mounts, barley twist poles and fairy lights, a <b>coconut</b> <b>shy,</b> hoop-la stalls, a rifle range and other stalls where you could win various prizes, including a goldfish if you could throw a table tennis ball into one of many goldfish bowls. Many tickets were issued to schoolchildren giving half price rides for threepence and popular records of the day were amplified and played all evening" [...] The various changes in life style sounded the death knell of the Swalwell in the 1960s. The [...] "Hopping Field" [...] is now a housing estate.|$|E
50|$|The Fat Controller {{is furious}} at the delays and warns the engines that any more {{disturbances}} will mean they won't {{be able to}} open the airport and the railway will close permanently. This leaves the engines deeply worried over their recent actions. As a result, several of them dream {{what might happen to}} them if The Fat Controller's warning did come true and the railway closed forever. James has a dream of being a <b>Coconut</b> <b>Shy</b> at a carnival, Gordon is added to a playground, Edward turns into a scarecrow; and Percy turns into a roller coaster.

50|$|Every July the St Lawrence Fair {{takes place}} in Hurstpierpoint. The fair was granted a royal charter in 1313 and is still an {{important}} event {{in the life of}} the village. The fair takes place on the first Saturday in July and begins with a procession of floats through the high street. These are made by groups such as playschools, primary schools, scouts and brownies and have a different theme each year. Other popular events of the day are the family fun run and the tug-o-war where the local pubs battle it out for a barrel of beer. In 2007 and 2008 it was won by the White Horse of Albourne Road. The fair is home to Harris fun fair and usually has a chair-o-plane amongst its rides as well as different stalls such as a <b>coconut</b> <b>shy.</b> Charities and businesses from around the area place stalls, tombolas and raffles around the centre, and on the other side is the beer tent and pig roast.|$|E
5000|$|One theory {{suggests}} the <b>coconut</b> <b>shy</b> may have originated {{at the annual}} Pleasure Fair in Kingston, Surrey in 1867. That event {{took place on the}} town's Fairfield, not far from a coconut fibre mill on the Hogsmill river. The Surrey Comet reported how [...] "for the small sum of one penny, you could have three throws with sticks with the prospect of getting a cocoa nut...". The coconuts could have come from nearby Middle Mill that advertised in the Surrey Comet as [...] "The Patent Cocoa Fibre Co Ltd the only cocoa nut fibre manufactory in Surrey. All descriptions of mats in cocoa nut fibre made to order wholesale". Today the only reminder of Kingston's association with coconuts is a pub in Mill Street, which was the principal route between Fairfield and Middle Mill for several centuries. Called [...] "The Cocoanut", it is not only spelled the old way but is furthermore the only pub in Britain with that name.|$|E
5000|$|The village {{community}} holds {{a number of}} typical English rural events during the year. The first on the calendar is the Easter Egg Hunt, always on Easter Saturday afternoon. The Village Fete, usually held on the second Saturday of June, {{is a mixture of}} traditional games (splat the rat, lucky golf, target soccer, <b>coconut</b> <b>shy,</b> crockery smash) and the usual stalls (white elephant, cakes and produce, plants, books, toys) accompanied by live music, steam engine rides and tea. The year is completed with Bonfire Night, always held on the traditional date of 5 November - bonfire, fireworks, food and drink. In recent years, special celebrations have been organised for the centenary of the Great Fire (2014), the Queen's Diamond Jubilee (2013), and Queen's 90th birthday (2016). Little Chesterford, in conjunction with its neighbour Great Chesterford, produces the Chesterford Broadsheet, a monthly newsletter which is distributed free of charge to each household. [...] Little Chesterford receives a fortnightly visit by the Saffron Walden mobile library service.|$|E
50|$|St John's {{plays an}} active role in the life of the local {{community}}. Among the many community events organised around the church is the annual May Fair. This is a popular family event, held on the second or third Saturday of the month, with stalls selling bric-a-brac, vintage jewellery, home-made cakes and jams, books, toys and plants. There is also a raffle and tombola. Children's activities include a bouncy castle, face painting, a <b>coconut</b> <b>shy,</b> candy floss, a cake decorating stall, Beat-the-Goalie and a Fancy Dress Competition, with judging at 3.30pm. Food and drink are also on sale with a barbecue outside, a Pimms stall, and traditional tea, cakes and sandwiches sold downstairs in the crypt. The annual May Fair forms a part of the larger Notting Hill MayfestEvery Thursday from 1-2pm, the church hosts free classical chamber music recitals, organized by local record label Music Chamber. Visitors may also enjoy free coffee, tea and biscuits. There is generally a retiring collection at the end of the recital.|$|E
40|$|Massive swings against Labor? Well, not really, writes BRIAN COSTAR FEDERAL {{and state}} by-elections in Australia {{are like the}} <b>coconut</b> <b>shy</b> at the county fair - {{everyone}} wins a prize, or can convince themselves that they have. That said, the responses to last Saturday’s by-elections for the federal seat of Gippsland and the Victorian state seat of Kororoit have been breathlessly extreme. We are told that the Rudd government is “reeling” from the “backlash” it suffered in Gippsland, where it took a “savage swing of 6. 5 per cent. ” The reaction to the Kororoit result has gone even further - some accounts {{would have us believe}} that the Brumby Labor government is set for certain defeat in 2010. Let’s get real. On Friday 27 June the National Party held the seat of Gippsland; on Sunday 29 June the National Party still held the seat of Gippsland. On Friday 27 June the Labor Party held the seat of Kororoit; on Sunday 29 June the ALP still held the seat of Kororoit. The largest factor influencing the final vote in each by-election was the entry of a competitive third candidate who had not contested the previous general election. In Gippsland this was the Liberal Party’s Rohan Fitzgerald; in Kororoit it was a high-profile independent, Les Twentyman. The result in Gippsland was totally predictable. The Liberal candidate polled 20 per cent, about 16 per cent of which came off the National and Labor vote. Why Labor? Because there are people who won’t vote National but will vote Liberal if given the chance - a chance they haven’t had in Gippsland since 1983. Another 4 per cent came from the voters for two small conservative parties that didn’t run this time. According to the latest count, the final vote in Gippsland is Nationals 62. 3 per cent to Labor 37. 67 per cent. This was a good result (+ 6. 4 %) for the Nats, and so it should have been. In the current climate the party that has held the seat since 1922 was not going to let it slip away. They had a good local candidate, ran a good campaign and spent money on it. But that swing also depended on the Liberals marshalling preferences for their Coalition partner. Meanwhile, an observer reading most of the comment on the by-election for the Victorian state seat of Kororoit could be forgiven for thinking that we had abolished preferential voting. Yes, the Labor candidate’s primary vote dropped 14 per cent on the 2006 result, but this was hardly surprising when Les Twentyman offered himself as a left-of-centre alternative to the ALP in one of its ultra safe seats. The obvious source of his vote was among those who had voted Labor in 2006, particularly given that the Liberal vote - a paltry 16 per cent - offered such slim pickings. Part of the confusion arises from the fact that, in order to calculate a two-party preferred figures during the count, the Victorian Electoral Commission settled on the Labor candidate, Marlene Kairoz, and Les Twentyman as the most likely frontrunners. On that basis, Labor has won the seat with 51. 09 per cent of the two-party preferred vote, but that won’t be the final result. The Liberal candidate is just ahead of Twentyman who, like the Greens, is directing his preferences to Labor and looks like having those preferences distributed. If that happens, and if about 85 per cent of those who voted Green or for Twentyman follow their how-to-vote cards, the final result will be around: Labor 73. 9 per cent Liberal 26. 1 per cent Swing from 2006 = 1. 6 per cent against Labor The Liberal Party has more to be worried about from this result than Premier Brumby. • Brian Costar is Professor of Victorian Parliamentary Democracy in the Institute for Social Research, Swinburne University of Technology.
