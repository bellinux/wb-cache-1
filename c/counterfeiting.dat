5|$|Congress {{passed a}} new <b>counterfeiting</b> statute in 1816 when it created the Second Bank of the United States. In United States v. Turner (1833), {{interpreting}} the new act, the Court {{held that the}} offense of <b>counterfeiting</b> was committed even if the signatures forged were those of the wrong bank officers. But, in United States v. Brewster (1833), the Court held that the crime applied only to counterfeit bills, not counterfeit notes.|$|E
5|$|Section 14 was {{repealed}} by § 17 of the Crimes Act of 1825, which broadened the offense of <b>counterfeiting</b> and reduced authorized the punishment from death to 10 years hard labor and a $5000 fine. Sections 18 through 21 of the 1825 Act created additional <b>counterfeiting</b> offenses.|$|E

50|$|Approximately 100,000 <b>counterfeit</b> {{euro coins}} {{are taken from}} {{circulation}} annually, and roughly the same number are seized {{before they can be}} released. Given a total circulation of 56 billion coins, <b>counterfeit</b> coins are relatively rare. About half the <b>counterfeits</b> feature the German national design, but <b>counterfeits</b> have been detected for every issuing country. The majority of <b>counterfeit</b> coins are €2 (60% in 2011), with most of the rest being €1, and a few €0.50 coins. The number of <b>counterfeit</b> €2 coins being found annually is decreasing, while numbers of <b>counterfeit</b> €1 and 50-cent coins are increasing.|$|R

5|$|Abel Starkey (died September 28, 1827) was {{a convicted}} {{counterfeiter}} whose death is {{closely tied to}} Old Newgate Prison after fatally falling during an escape attempt {{the night before the}} close of the prison. Starkey was from Roxbury, Massachusetts and became a counterfeiter. Members of a <b>counterfeiting</b> ring had eluded authorities for years, but they finally discovered the secret third attic of a lightning splitter home. Starkey was arrested, tried and convicted of <b>counterfeiting.</b> He was sentenced to a term of twenty years in the prison, where he would amass a sum of money. His attempt to escape ended in his death, accounts of Starkey's attempt continued to be popular in reference to the prison's history.|$|E

2500|$|Another notable {{feature of}} the hoard is the {{inclusion}} of 39 <b>counterfeit</b> coins, most of them from Pots A and B (only six from Pot C). [...] Most of the <b>counterfeits</b> are copies of contemporary English coins, but Pots A and B both include <b>counterfeits</b> of Spanish-American reales, {{which may have been}} <b>counterfeited</b> because the genuine coins were often poorly struck and would not have been very familiar to most people. [...] Two of the three <b>counterfeit</b> Spanish-American coins in Pot A were cast from the same mould, and the two <b>counterfeit</b> Spanish-American coins in Pot B were also cast from the same mould, which suggests that the <b>counterfeits</b> may well have been made locally (if the <b>counterfeits</b> came from far away {{there would have been a}} higher degree of diversity). [...] It is also possible that some of the <b>counterfeit</b> English coins were made locally, such as copy of a Charles I shilling from the York mint.|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{illicit trade}} in <b>counterfeit</b> {{antimalarial}} drugs {{is a major}} setback to the fight against malaria. Information on public awareness and ability to identify <b>counterfeit</b> drugs is scanty. Aim. Therefore, the present study aimed at assessing public awareness {{and the ability to}} identify <b>counterfeit</b> antimalarial drugs based on simple observations such as appearance of the drugs, packaging, labelling, and leaflets. Methodology. A cross-sectional study was conducted using interviewer administered structured questionnaire and a checklist. Respondents were required to spot the difference between genuine and <b>counterfeit</b> antimalarial drugs given to them. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20. Results. The majority of respondents, 163 (55. 6 %), were able to distinguish between genuine and <b>counterfeit</b> antimalarial drugs. Respondents with knowledge on health effects of <b>counterfeit</b> drugs were more likely to identify genuine and <b>counterfeit</b> drugs than their counterparts (P= 0. 003; OR = 2. 95; 95 % CI: 1. 47 – 5. 65). The majority of respondents, 190 (64. 8 %), perceived the presence of <b>counterfeit</b> drugs to be a big problem to the community. Conclusions. A substantial proportion of respondents were able to distinguish between genuine and <b>counterfeit</b> antimalarial drugs. Public empowerment in identifying <b>counterfeit</b> drugs by simple observations is a major step towards discouraging the market of <b>counterfeit</b> drugs...|$|R

5|$|As Warden, and {{afterwards}} Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 {{percent of the}} coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. <b>Counterfeiting</b> was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult. However, Newton proved equal to the task.|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} part of thesis describes {{the theory of}} <b>counterfeits</b> and review of foreign literature.

Main determinants of demand for <b>counterfeits</b> are experience with <b>counterfeits,</b> satisfaction with them, price of <b>counterfeits</b> and current income. Analysis has shown, that these determinants could be applied to both cities and they are significant in almost all of the models.

40|$|The fast {{growth of}} fashion brands and the {{popularity}} of <b>counterfeit</b> goods has posed certain challenges to the existing and new luxury fashion brand players. This study elaborates on the factors driving the market for <b>counterfeit</b> products in the UK. The data collected by means of survey questionnaires from 306 respondents and empirical techniques including descriptive and inferential statistics (correlation and multiple regression analysis), {{have shown that the}} consumers have a negative attitude towards <b>counterfeit</b> luxury products. However, they showed fewer tendencies to seek for a brand whose <b>counterfeit</b> cannot easily be found and preferred to buy a genuine rather than a <b>counterfeit.</b> In terms of frequency of purchase, reversion to <b>counterfeit</b> has negative impact, unlike the tendency to seek a brand whose <b>counterfeit</b> is hard to find. The overall results show that the attitude and acceptance of <b>counterfeit</b> do not greatly prevail in the market. However, about 27 % of respondents demonstrated either a positive or a neutral tendency towards <b>counterfeit</b> products, which could have serious implications for the luxury goods market...|$|R

In 1999, a Class I example sold for $4.14 million, then the highest price paid for any coin. Their high value has caused 1804 dollars to be a frequent target of <b>counterfeiting</b> and other methods of deception.|$|E

We assess <b>counterfeit</b> reports involving the legitimate supply chain using 2009 – 2011 {{data from the}} Pharmaceutical Security Institute <b>Counterfeit</b> Incident System (PSI CIS) database that uses both open and nonpublic data sources. Of the 1, 510 identified CIS reports involving <b>counterfeits,</b> 27. 6 % reported China as the source country of the incident/detection. Further, 51. 3 % were reported as <b>counterfeit</b> but the specific <b>counterfeit</b> subcategory was not known or verifiable. The most prevalent therapeutic category was anti-infectives (21. 1 %) with most reports originating from health-related government agencies. Geographically, Asian and Latin American regions and, economically, middle-income markets were most represented. A total of 127 (64. 8 %) {{of a total of}} 196 countries had no legitimate supply chain CIS <b>counterfeit</b> reports. Improvements in surveillance, including detection of security breaches, data collection, analysis, and dissemination are urgently needed to address public health needs to combat the global <b>counterfeit</b> medicines trade...|$|R
