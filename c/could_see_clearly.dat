25|$|Her {{original}} {{power was}} nothing more than was due to earnestness and intellectual clearness within a certain range. With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, she <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> what she did see, and give a clear expression to what she had to say. In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.|$|E
500|$|The {{fighting}} at Hougoumont {{has often}} been characterised as a diversionary attack to draw in Wellington's reserves which escalated into an all-day battle and drew in French reserves instead. In fact {{there is a good}} case to believe that both Napoleon and Wellington thought that holding Hougoumont was key to winning the battle. Hougoumont {{was a part of the}} battlefield that Napoleon <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly,</b> and he continued to direct resources towards it and its surroundings all afternoon (33battalions in all, 14,000troops). Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21battalions (12,000troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont, and later stated that [...] "the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont".|$|E
2500|$|After so many {{exchanges of}} recrimination {{with his own}} men, and after various {{attempts}} to regroup what was becoming a progressively disorderly army, 'Ali is reported by Tabari in a most revealing passage to have explained his acceptance of the arbitration as such: [...] "It is no sin but only a failure of judgement." [...] Nothing sums up the moral and religious complexity of the situation better than this sentence. The group that made a big issue of 'Ali's dilemma were the Kharijites, who for reasons of their own <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> the religious and political issues involved, who agreed neither with 'Ali nor with his opponent but were in turn incapable of administering a polity of their own. Tabari's account also brings that out very clearly when he relates (p.115) how the assembled Kharijites, who were quite willing to expound {{the reasons for their}} recession from 'Ali's forces, would one by one refuse to take the leadership of their own group, a situation quite characteristic of religious purists when confronted with [...] "dirty" [...] politics.|$|E

60|$|I {{think there}} were tears in her eyes when I left her, but I <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>clearly,</b> for mine also had {{suddenly}} grown dim.|$|R

2500|$|In The Observer, Andrew Rawnsley {{commented that}} he {{believes}} that Ashcroft uses carefully timed opinion polls to [...] "generate publicity", [...] "stir trouble for the prime minister" [...] and influence {{the direction of the}} party. In 2015 Ashcroft released Call Me Dave, an unauthorised biography of Cameron written with journalist Isabel Oakeshott, which attracted significant media attention for various lurid allegations about Cameron's time at university. The book includes an anonymous anecdote about Cameron, now referred to as Piggate. [...] No evidence for the anecdote has been produced. Many commentators have described the accusations as a [...] "revenge job" [...] by Ashcroft, who was not offered a senior role in government when Cameron came to power in 2010. Ashcroft initially claimed the book was [...] "not about settling scores", while Oakeshott said that they had held back publication until after the 2015 general election to avoid damaging Cameron and the Conservatives' electoral chances. Ashcroft subsequently admitted that the initiation allegations [...] "may have been case of mistaken identity" [...] and has stated that he has a personal [...] "beef" [...] with Cameron. Cameron later went on to deny these allegations and stated that Ashcroft's reasons for writing the book were clear and the public <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> through it.|$|E
60|$|From the baffled {{look upon}} Holmes's face, I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> that he did.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened the}} lid, placed the Record {{so that the}} President <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly,</b> and then watched the {{changing}} expressions upon the great man's face; first indifference, then interest, the next moment eagerness and amazement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hungrier and hungrier," [...] cried one in {{a shrill}} voice, {{suddenly}} lifting its head, so that Nod <b>could</b> <b>see</b> quite <b>clearly</b> its pale green, greedy slits of eyes.|$|R
60|$|Moses {{took it in}} his hand, and for a {{few moments}} there came a mist over his eyes,--he <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>clearly.</b> He walked to the window as if needing a clearer light.|$|R
60|$|With care, {{so as not}} to sprain an ankle, the two chums {{climbed down}} to the split in the rocks. By this time it was growing dark, and in the hollow they <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>clearly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|As we rushed {{down the}} ravine we <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> all before us. But [...] now, {{just as we}} were {{beginning}} to fear lest some mischance might [...] allow some of them to reach the glade, there was another cause of [...] surprise--of rejoicing.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the first}} time since the action began that I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly,</b> and glancing across the narrow space of water which {{separated}} the two vessels, I saw that the mass of red had dwindled until no more than six or seven lobster backs stood opposed to us, while three sailors were doing whatsoever they could toward wearing ship in order to take to their heels.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes had}} become quite {{accustomed}} to the darkness beyond the light. She <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> the powerful figure on bended knees, the wide shoulders with the bandages disposed over them by the physician for the healing of those horrible wounds, and the fingers linked together in a manner which {{she had never seen}} before. And now the hands stirred ever so slightly, the light caught the fingers more directly, and Dea Flavia saw that--clasped between them--there was a small wooden cross.|$|E
5000|$|At the 2006 MTV Movie Awards, Borat {{introduced}} Gnarls Barkley's {{performance of}} [...] "Crazy", {{where he made}} a comment about Jessica Simpson, saying that he liked her mouth and that he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> it <b>clearly</b> through her denim pants.|$|R
60|$|He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> quite <b>clearly</b> {{the tall}} boulder {{untouched}} by the tide, on which he had placed the black silk shade that night, also the broad-brimmed hat, so that these things should be found high and dry and be easily recognizable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of Chaucer truly I {{know not}} whether to marvel more, either that he in [...] that misty time <b>could</b> <b>see</b> so <b>clearly,</b> {{or that we}} in this clear age walk [...] so stumblingly after him." [...] (Philip Sidney, cir. 1581) ...|$|R
60|$|We {{went through}} the gross nakedness of streets without people, till we reached the railway station, which was very fairly knocked about, but, as my friends said, nothing like {{as much as the}} cathedral. Then we had to cross {{the end of a long}} street down which the Boche <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly.</b> As one glanced up it, one {{perceived}} how the weeds, to whom men's war is the truce of God, had come back and were well established the whole length of it, watched by the long perspective of open, empty windows.|$|E
60|$|For {{the next}} three days the captain kept his {{daughter}} under observation, and never allowed her to stir abroad except in his company. The evening of the third day, to his own great surprise, he spent at a Dorcas. The company was not congenial, several of the ladies putting their work away, and glaring frigidly at the intruder; and though they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> that he was suffering greatly, made no attempt to put him at his ease. He was very thoughtful all the way home, and the next day took a partner into the concern, in the shape of his boatswain.|$|E
60|$|Then {{followed}} {{a few moments}} of confusion while men kissed their wives, children and sisters in farewell, or shook each other by the hand. I, too, kissed Marie, and, tumbling on to my horse somehow, rode away, my eyes blind with tears, for this parting was bitter. When I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> again I pulled up and looked back at the camp, which was now at some distance. It seemed a peaceful place indeed, for although the storm of the morning was returning and a pall of dark cloud hung over it, the sun still shone upon the white wagon caps and the people who went to and fro among them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, come here"; he <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> her <b>clearly,</b> for {{the cloud}} {{in front of}} his eyes. [...] "I'm not well, I want some sal volatile." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{large room}} had been bright, with white {{curtains}} softly blowing inward from the open windows. As she crept forward, not sure on her feet, all seemed to blur, so that when she leaned over the still face to kiss it she <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>clearly.</b> Her lips quivered with that kiss and with her sob of thankfulness.|$|R
60|$|With {{infinite}} relief, {{she made}} her final curtsey to her partner, and allowed him to lead {{her back to her}} official place beside the royal da√Øs. She <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>clearly,</b> for her eyes had suddenly filled with burning tears of shame and bitter self-accusation. She bit her lips lest a cry of pain escaped them.|$|R
60|$|Out of the water, {{his great}} wings flapping, rose Plunger. Peter looked eagerly {{to see if}} he had caught a fish, but there was nothing in Plunger's great, curved claws. Either that fish had been too deep or had seen Plunger and darted away just in the nick of time. Peter had a splendid view of Plunger. He was just a little bigger than Redtail the Hawk. Above he was dark brown, his head and neck marked with white. His tail was grayish, crossed by several narrow dark bands and tipped with white. His under parts were white with some light brown spots on his breast. Peter <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> the great, curved claws which are Plunger's fishhooks.|$|E
6000|$|He hurried downstairs at once. Maggie <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> enough, now {{the thing}} was done, {{that it was very}} foolish, and that she should have to hear and think more about her hair than ever. As she stood crying before the glass she felt it {{impossible}} to go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes and severe words of her aunts, while Tom, and Lucy, and Martha, who waited at table, and perhaps her father and her uncles, would laugh at her--for if Tom had laughed at her, of course every one else would; and if she had only let her hair alone, she could have sat with Tom and Lucy, and had the apricot pudding and the custard! ...|$|E
60|$|The Doctor {{had walked}} {{home from the}} station in a peaceable and relenting frame of mind, feeling that, perhaps, he had said {{too much in the}} morning, that his daughters had for years been models in every way, and that, if there had been any change of late, it was, as they said themselves, on account of their anxiety to follow his advice and to imitate Mrs. Westmacott. He <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> enough now that that advice was unwise, and that a world peopled with Mrs. Westmacotts would not be a happy or a {{soothing}} one. It was he who was, himself, to blame, and he was grieved by the thought that perhaps his hot words had troubled and saddened his two girls.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Dick, {{of course}} you're right, and I wish I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> things as <b>clearly</b> as you do. But I really believe Kitty's {{glad to be}} out of it." ...|$|R
50|$|Deputy Hugh Sawyer never fired a shot. If Sawyer {{had been}} a more {{experienced}} deputy, Lynn would have likely been killed on the spot. However, Deputy Marshal Sawyer was inexperienced, and froze when the shot was fired, watching Lynn as he fled, then going to Tilghman's aid. He also later testified that he <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> exactly what happened.|$|R
60|$|Just as {{they were}} going to leave the garden they saw a ship sailing nearer the tower than any other had done before. On the deck lay a young man under a splendid awning, gazing at the tower through a spy-glass; but before they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{anything}} <b>clearly</b> the ship moved away, and the two ladies parted, the fairy promising to return shortly.|$|R
60|$|We shall {{probably}} go to Rome {{again for the}} winter, as Florence is considered too cold. There will be disturbances that way in all probability; but we are bold as to such things. The Pope is hard to manage, even for the Emperor. It is hard to cut up a feather bed into sandwiches with the finest Damascus blade, but the end will be attained somehow. I wish I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> about Venetia. There are intelligent and thoughtful Italians who are hopeful even for Venetia, and certainly, the Emperor of Austria's offer to Tuscany (not made to the Assembly, as the 'Times' said, but murmured about by certain agents) implies a consciousness on his part of holding Venetia, with a broken wrist at least.|$|E
60|$|I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> {{that they}} did not believe one word what I told them, but evidently they {{considered}} me the most respectable liar they had ever met. They glanced at one another, and then concentrated the fire of their eyes on me. I fancy they expected a clue to me in the way I helped myself to salt. They seemed to find something significant in my peppering my egg. These strangely shaped masses of gold they had staggered under held their minds. There the lumps lay in front of me, each worth thousands of pounds, and as impossible for any one to steal as a house or a piece of land. As I looked at their curious faces over my coffee-cup, I realised something of the enormous wilderness of explanations into which I should have to wander to render myself comprehensible again.|$|E
60|$|By and by {{even the}} vision of Babbie in the dogcart was blotted out. If nothing had taken its place, {{he would not have}} gone on probably; and had he turned back objectless, his {{strength}} would have succumbed to the rain. Now he saw Babbie and Rintoul being married by a minister who was himself, and there was a fair company looking on, and always {{when he was on the}} point of shouting to himself, whom he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>clearly,</b> that this woman was already married, the rain obscured his words and the light went out. Presently the ceremony began again, always to stop at the same point. He saw it in the lightning-flash that had startled the hill. It gave him courage to fight his way onward, because he thought he must be heard if he could draw nearer to the company.|$|E
50|$|In November 2008, NASA {{announced}} that a planet was directly observed orbiting the nearby star Fomalhaut. The planet <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>clearly</b> on images taken by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys' coronagraph in 2004 and 2006 http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/fomalhaut.html. The dark area hidden by the coronagraph mask {{can be seen on}} the images, though a bright dot has been added to show where the star would have been.|$|R
50|$|In 1984 {{the tree}} was entered in the National Trust of Queensland's Register of Significant Trees for its reputed {{association}} with the hanging of Aboriginal people. The nominator wrote that he had first seen the Hanging Tree many years prior and {{described it as a}} beautiful Ghost Gum that over the years had grown around the timber beam, which <b>could</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>clearly</b> in 1964.|$|R
60|$|Mara, {{who stood}} {{at the foot of}} the tree, <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>clearly</b> what was going on, for the {{thickness}} of the boughs; she only heard a great commotion and rattling of the branches, the scream of the birds, and the swooping of their wings, and Moses's valorous exclamations, as he seemed to be laying about him with a branch which he had broken off.|$|R
