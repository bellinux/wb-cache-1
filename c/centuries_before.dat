5|$|According to K. Indrapala, {{cultural}} diffusion, {{rather than}} migration of people, spread the Prakrit and Tamil languages from peninsular India into an existing mesolithic population, <b>centuries</b> <b>before</b> the common era.

5|$|Carmarthenshire {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since prehistoric times. The town of Carmarthen {{was founded by}} the Romans, and the region {{was part of the}} Principality of Deheubarth during the High Middle Ages. It saw turbulent times during the invasion by the Normans in the 12th and 13h <b>centuries</b> <b>before</b> it was subjugated, along with other parts of Wales, by Edward I of England. There was further unrest in the early 15th century when the Welsh rebelled under Owain Glyndŵr, and more strife during the English Civil War in the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|<b>Centuries</b> <b>before</b> {{the conquest}} of Sogdiana by the Achaemenid Empire of Persia, Sogdiana possessed a Bronze Age urban culture that was {{gradually}} displaced by the Indo-European migrations of the Iron Age. This large-scale migration included Eastern Iranian speaking peoples such as the Sogdians. The original Bronze Age towns appear in the archaeological record beginning with the settlement at Sarazm, Tajikistan, spanning {{as far back as}} the 4th millennium BC and then at Kök Tepe, near modern-day Bulungur, Uzbekistan, from at least the 15th century BC.|$|E

Initially built five <b>centuries</b> <b>before,</b> a disastrous magical experiment caused the Towers to be infested by monsters. Fifty years {{prior to the start of}} the game, a new experiment involving the monsters triggers the Scar's creation.|$|E

5|$|In 1585 the Flemish {{mathematician}} Simon Stevin {{published a}} small pamphlet called De Theinde ("the tenth"). Decimal fractions had been employed for {{the extraction of}} square roots some five <b>centuries</b> <b>before</b> his time, but nobody used decimal numbers in daily life. Stevin declared that using decimals was so important that the universal introduction of decimal weights, measures and coinage {{was only a matter}} of time.|$|E
5|$|Stropharia caerulea, {{commonly}} known as the blue roundhead, is an inedible species of agaric fungus in the family Strophariaceae. It is a common species found in Europe and North America, where it grows as a saprophyte in meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch. S.caerulea was officially described to science in 1979, although it was known to be a distinct species for about two <b>centuries</b> <b>before</b> that. The taxon Stropharia cyanea, as defined by Risto Tuomikoski in 1953, and used by several later authors, is a synonym of S.caerulea.|$|E

5|$|The land in question, {{which had}} been part of the Seneca Nation's {{traditional}} territory for <b>centuries</b> <b>before</b> the American Revolution, comprised part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase, a tract of land disputed after the war between claims of New York and Massachusetts. By a December 16, 1786 interstate compact, the states agreed that Massachusetts would retain the proprietary rights and the pre-emption rights, but New York would retain governmental rights. After the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1787, the federal government ratified their compact.|$|E

These collection of maps were signed by Polo's three daughters: Fantina, Bellela and Moreta.

5|$|Two <b>centuries</b> <b>before</b> Mau and the Hōkūle‘a, Captain James Cook, {{with the}} help of Tupaia, gained {{knowledge}} that otherwise would have been closely held.

Before the Hōkūle‘a voyage in 1976, academic debate about the settlement of Polynesia was divided between several schools of thought.|$|E

5|$|A Song of Ice and Fire {{takes place}} in a fictional world in which seasons last for years and end unpredictably. Nearly three <b>centuries</b> <b>before</b> the events of the first novel (see backstory), the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty by Aegon I and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, with Aegon Targaryen {{becoming}} the first king of the whole of the continent of Westeros, save for the southerly Dorne. At the beginning of A Game of Thrones, 15 peaceful years have passed since the rebellion led by Robert Baratheon deposed and killed the last Targaryen king, Aerys II, and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms, with a nine year long summer coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|After being rested for the eight-wicket {{win over}} Hampshire, Morris {{rectified}} his technical problem, and success followed against Sussex. After the hosts had been rolled for 86 {{in their first}} innings, Morris dominated an opening partnership of 153 with Brown, who made only 44 before becoming {{the first man to}} fall. Morris added a further 189 for the second wicket with Bradman before he fell for 184 at 2/342. He had struck 26 fours, laying the platform for Australia's total of 5/549 declared and eventual innings victory. He was to hit five more first-class <b>centuries</b> <b>before</b> the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|Bone, {{both human}} and animal, was also sculpted; human bones may have been trophies, or relics of ancestors. The Maya valued Spondylus shells, and worked them to remove the white {{exterior}} and spines, to reveal the fine orange interior. Around the 10th century AD, metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America, and the Maya began to make small objects in gold, silver and copper. The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads, bells, and discs. In the last <b>centuries</b> <b>before</b> the Spanish Conquest, the Maya began to use the lost-wax method to cast small metal pieces.|$|E

5|$|Morris {{marked his}} {{first-class}} debut on English soil with a fluent 138 against Worcestershire, which was scored in only {{four hours and}} made him the first Australian centurion on tour. Morris found batting difficult {{for the first few}} weeks as he adapted to the alien batting conditions, reaching 50 only twice in his next nine innings with a total of 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease. He rectified this, and success followed with 184 against Sussex in the final match before the First Test. Five more <b>centuries</b> <b>before</b> the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|The Late Woodland era is {{generally}} considered to have begun about 600 AD and lasted until the arrival of Europeans in Indiana. It {{was a period of}} rapid cultural change. One of the new developments—which has yet to be explained—was the introduction of masonry, shown by the construction of large, stone forts, many of which overlook the Ohio River. Romantic legend used to attribute the forts to Welsh Indians who supposedly arrived <b>centuries</b> <b>before</b> Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean. Archaeologists and other scholars have found no evidence for that theory and believe that the cultural development was engendered by the Mississippian culture.|$|E
5|$|The first iron {{production}} {{started in}} the Middle Bronze Age but it took several <b>centuries</b> <b>before</b> iron displaced bronze. Samples of smelted iron from Asmar, Mesopotamia and Tall Chagar Bazaar in northern Syria were made sometime between 3000 and 2700BC. The Hittites established an empire in north-central Anatolia around 1600 BC. They {{appear to be the}} first to understand the production of iron from its ores and regard it highly in their society. The Hittites began to smelt iron between 1500 and 1200BC and the practice spread to the rest of the Near East after their empire fell in 1180BC. The subsequent period is called the Iron Age.|$|E
