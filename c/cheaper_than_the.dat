5|$|The PlayStation 3 Slim was {{introduced}} on August 18, 2009. At US$299, it is US$100 <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> previous model; {{it is also}} approximately ⅓ lighter and more energy efficient. The two original PS3 Slim models, priced at US$299.99 and US$349.99 respectively, hold 120/250GB. These were then superseded by 160GB and 320GB models, which are priced at US$249.99 and US$299.99 respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas studied four {{options for}} a tunnel from Brooklyn to New Jersey, some {{involving}} a tunnel to Staten Island. These included {{an option for}} a tunnel directly from Greenville Yard to the Bay Ridge Branch, and a link from New Jersey to Manhattan. Also under consideration was a single-tube tunnel with accommodations for electric units only. The Greenville–Brooklyn tunnel would be about $331 million, which was <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> approximately $405 million tunnel from Staten Island to Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|Grid parity, {{the point}} at which the cost of {{photovoltaic}} electricity is equal to or <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> price of grid power, is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in California and Japan. In 2008, The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the OECD countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the OECD and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, {{the most}} recent year for which {{statistics}} are available, AirTrain JFK carried 6,487,118 paid passengers, with another 10 million using the service for free on-airport travel. This is a 247% increase over 2004, the first full year of operation, when 2,623,791 riders paid. The 2014 paid ridership is 12% of the 53.2 million passengers that used JFK that year. The ridership of AirTrain JFK has risen each year from 2004 to 2014, which Governor Andrew Cuomo touted in a 2015 announcement in which he also announced the plan for AirTrain LaGuardia, a similar system to be built at LaGuardia Airport. The $5 fare is much <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> $45 one must pay for a taxi between Manhattan and JFK, which may be a factor in the increased ridership.|$|E
5|$|In {{its last}} two years of operation, wartime rises in costs made the fixed fare {{structure}} untenable, and between July 1939 and January 1941 there were five slight adjustments to the fares. The live passenger rates rose to 7s5d in first class and 2s6d in third class, with equivalent changes to the fares for coffins. These fares remained far <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> equivalent fares from Waterloo to Brookwood for both living and dead passengers on the Southern Railway (SR), which had absorbed the LSWR in the 1923 restructuring of Britain's railways. The fare structure of January 1941 remained in use following the April 1941 suspension of London Necropolis Railway services, for the occasional funerals conducted by the LNC using the SR's platforms at Waterloo station, but the SR only allowed mourners attending funerals to use these cheap fares and not those visiting the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The Amiral Charner {{class was}} a group of four {{armoured}} cruisers built for the French Navy during the 1890s. They were designed to be smaller and <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> preceding design while also serving as commerce raiders in times of war. Three of the ships were assigned to the International Squadron off the island of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 to protect French interests and citizens. With several exceptions the sister ships spent most of {{the first decade of the}} 20th century serving as training ships or in reserve. Bruix aided survivors of the devastating eruption of Mount Pelée on the island of Martinique in 1902. Chanzy was transferred to French Indochina in 1906 and ran aground off the Chinese coast in mid-1907. She proved impossible to refloat and was destroyed in place.|$|E

5|$|The {{game had}} {{multiple}} versions for players to purchase. A season pass was announced on November 12, 2015. Players who bought {{this version of}} the game could gain early access to operators offered in the DLCs and receive several weapon skins. The game was also released alongside its Collector's Edition, which included the game's season pass, a hat, a compass and bottle opener, a backpack, and a 120-page guide. A Starter Edition was released on PC in June 2016, featuring all the maps, modes and weapons of the standard edition, and included two operators plus enough Rainbow 6 Credits to purchase two more of the player's choice (players could purchase the rest of the operators with Renown or Rainbow 6 Credits). The Starter Edition was <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> main game, and was initially available for a limited time. In February 2017, the Starter Edition became permanently available via Uplay.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids {{and their}} closer neighbours mostly {{cost less than}} silver; only polonium and astatine are more expensive than gold, on account of their significant radioactivity. As of 5 April 2014, prices for small samples (up to 100 g) of silicon, antimony and tellurium, and graphite, aluminium and selenium, average around one third the cost of silver (US$1.5 per gram or about $45 an ounce). Boron, germanium and arsenic samples average about three-and-a-half times the cost of silver. Polonium is available for about $100 per microgram. Zalutsky and Pruszynski estimate a similar cost for producing astatine. Prices for the applicable elements traded as commodities tend to range from {{two to three times}} <b>cheaper</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> sample price (Ge), to nearly three thousand times cheaper (As).|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{low-cost}} calculators was the Sinclair Cambridge, launched in August 1973. It retailed for £29.95 ($), or £5 ($) less in kit form.

25|$|Physical {{simulation}} {{refers to}} simulation in which physical objects are substituted {{for the real}} thing (some circles use the term for computer simulations modelling selected laws of physics, but this article does not).
