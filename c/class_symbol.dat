The needle points the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward. The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend it. The Second Class badge features a scroll inscribed with the Scout Motto, with the ends turned up and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom. The knot reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service. The First Class badge combines {{the elements of the}} Tenderfoot and Second Class badges. For years, the First Class badge was used as the emblem of the BSA. Star has a First <b>Class</b> <b>symbol</b> on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank.

Comparative genomic analyses between rosaceous species are increasingly being used to assign putative function. With the wealth of new data, there is a need to standardize nomenclature to ensure uniformity and clarity across research groups. The Rosaceae Gene Name Standardization Committee was formed to develop a naming guideline for genes in Rosaceae family members. This manuscript details the issues involved with naming genes and proposes a common nomenclature system. The Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR) (www. rosaceae. org) has developed a gene database that will support user-submitted gene names and annotations in addition to the predicted genes from whole genome sequences. GDR also hosts user-curated lists of gene <b>class</b> <b>symbols.</b> To facilitate standardization of gene names and avoid misinterpretation, the committee recommends that the GDR serve as the database of record for the names of Rosaceae genes and that gene names, gene <b>class</b> <b>symbols,</b> and gene annotation be registered in GDR prior to publication in peer reviewed journal...|$|R
5000|$|Otter is a {{classification}} {{referring to a}} particular design for a two-man sailing dinghy with a glass fibre hull. Its rig consists of a main, a jib and an optional symmetric spinnaker. The hull dimensions are 11 ft 11 in length and 4 ft 10 in beam. The boat has a draft of 3 ft 6 in with the centreboard down. The sail area (main and jib) is 75 sq. ft. The <b>class</b> <b>symbol</b> is a stylised glass bubble; due to the original lightweight [...] "cigar box cedar" [...] construction of the prototypes, the name 'Bubble' was first used for the boat. John Baker obtained the plans for an expanded version of the boat in G.R.P. and hence renamed the boat 'Glass Bubble'.

5000|$|People often {{wonder why}} the <b>class</b> <b>symbol</b> is a bell. One {{suspects}} that it relates (strictly unofficially) to the original manufacturer, Bell Woodworking.

However what may have been an inspired compromise was found for the insignia; the first boat of the class was launched in Aberdyfi, Wales, and the class was taken up by the local club, then the Dovey Sailing Club (now Dovey Yacht Club), so the official explanation was (and still is) that it is a reference to the legendary bells of Aberdovey, Cantre'r Gwaelod, [...] and it is just coincidence that the early boats happened to be built by Bell Woodworking.|$|E

The knot reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, Do a Good Turn Daily, and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service.

"The {{stability}} of the public realm in turn relies upon natural and objective mental structures which, with proper education, govern a natural progression from particular to general concepts. Since for Cutter, mind, society, and SKO of Knowledge Organization stand one behind the other, each supporting each, all manifesting the same structure, his discursive construction of subjects invites connections with discourses of mind, education, and society. The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), by contrast, severs those connections. Melvil Dewey emphasized more than once that his system maps no structure beyond its own; there is neither a [...] "transcendental deduction" [...] of its categories nor any reference to Cutter's objective structure of social consensus. It is content-free: Dewey disdained any philosophical excogitation {{of the meaning of}} his class symbols, leaving the job of finding verbal equivalents to others. His innovation and the essence of the system lay in the notation. The DDC is a poorly semiotic system of expanding nests of ten digits, lacking any referent beyond itself. In it, a subject is wholly constituted in terms of its position in the system. The essential characteristic of a subject is a <b>class</b> <b>symbol</b> which refers only to other symbols. Its verbal equivalent is accidental, a merely pragmatic characteristic....... The conflict of interpretations over [...] "subjects" [...] became explicit in the battles between [...] "bibliography" [...] (an approach to subjects having much in common with Cutter's) and Dewey's [...] "close classification". William Fletcher spoke for the scholarly bibliographer.... Fletcher's [...] "subjects", like Cutter's, referred to the categories of a fantasized, stable social order, whereas Dewey's subjects were elements of a semiological system of standardized, techno-bureaucratic administrative software for the library in its corporate, rather than high culture, incarnation".

30|$|The gene symbol is an {{abbreviation}} of {{the gene}} full name and the gene symbol is written in italics. A gene symbol consists of two parts, namely, a gene <b>class</b> <b>symbol</b> consisting of two to five letters, and the corresponding locus designator consisting of one to three digits. The gene symbol should be derived from the full name {{of the gene}} discussed previously, and it {{is followed by the}} same locus designator assigned to the full gene name. Both parts of the gene symbol should be written together with no space, hyphen, or any other symbol between them (e.g., SH 1, GLH 2). Together, the gene <b>class</b> <b>symbol</b> and locus designator form a gene symbol that must be unique to the locus and the genome. Every effort should be made to assign gene symbols that are easily recognizable as corresponding to a gene full name. Where possible, existing symbols should be retained even if they do not fully conform to this rule, for example: C (CHROMOGEN FOR ANTHOCYANIN), A (ANTHOCYANIN ACTIVATOR), and WX (GLUTINOUS ENDOSPERM). For any gene symbol that does not have a locus designator, it is presumed that the first such gene identified has the locus designator, “ 1 ”, e.g., the previously identified gene, GLUTINOUS ENDOSPERM (WX) should be designated GLUTINOUS ENDOSPERM 1 (WX 1). All new genes with similar characteristics will be assigned a new number as the new locus designator by the CGSNL, in order of discovery. The CSGNL will also make sure that previously identified gene symbols and newly identified genes that were not previously registered are assigned a unique gene symbol, thus avoiding conflicting names and symbols.|$|E
