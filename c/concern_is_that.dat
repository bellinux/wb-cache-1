5|$|The double bottoms {{are also}} subject to design constraints. The primary <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they be {{high enough to}} allow the passage of pipes and cables. These areas must also be roomy enough to allow people safe access to perform surveys and maintenance. On the other hand, {{concerns}} of excess weight and wasted volume keep the double bottoms very tight spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{drilling}} {{project has}} been opposed by some environmental groups and scientists who have argued that hot-water drilling would have a more limited environmental impact. The main <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the bore hole from refreezing. Scientists of the United States National Research Council have taken the position {{that it should be}} assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that after such a long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sources for}} {{knowledge}} of Wilfrid are the medieval Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, written by Stephen of Ripon soon after Wilfrid's death, and {{the works of}} the medieval historian Bede, who knew Wilfrid during the bishop's lifetime. Stephen's Vita is a hagiography, intended to show Wilfrid as a saintly man, and to buttress claims that he was a saint. The Vita is selective in its coverage, and gives short shrift to Wilfrid's activities outside of Northumbria. Two-thirds of the work deals with Wilfrid's attempts to return to Northumbria, and is a defence and vindication of his Northumbrian career. Stephen's work is flattering and highly favourable to Wilfrid, making its use as a source problematic; despite its shortcomings however, the Vita is the main source of information on Wilfrid's life. It views the events in Northumbria in the light of Wilfrid's reputation and from his point of view, and is highly partisan. Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> hagiographies were usually full of conventional material, often repeated from earlier saints' lives, {{as was the case with}} Stephen's work. It appears that the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi was not well known in the Middle Ages, as only two manuscripts of the work survive.|$|E
25|$|Part of the <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> many British {{veterans}} {{were receiving}} pensions and had long-term disabilities.|$|R
50|$|The company's main <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the event}} {{programmes}} were rushed, but ultimately none of Dawna's weaknesses affected her job application.|$|R
50|$|Results {{from the}} program {{unveiled}} multiple issues, concerns, solutions and new found knowledge of transgender people living with HIV/AIDS. There <b>were</b> three main <b>concerns</b> regarding HIV/AIDS within the transgender community at this time. The first <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> HIV/AIDS equating to stigmatization and shame. As one of the registrants said, the stigma that existed during this time made the participant feel “dirty… like...a lower minority than most minorities” (19). Another <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> HIV/AIDS would interfere with individuals seeking sexreassignment surgery. The final <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> health professionals lacked transgender sensitivity.|$|R
25|$|A final <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{bisulfite}} treatment greatly {{reduces the}} level of complexity in the sample, which can be problematic if multiple PCR reactions are to be performed (2006). Primer design is more difficult, and inappropriate cross-hybridization is more frequent.|$|E
25|$|Lidocaine {{has been}} used in cases that do not improve with other more typical medications. One <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{seizures}} often begin again 30 minutes after it is stopped. Additionally, it is not recommended in those with heart or liver problems.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{sometimes}} companies use CSR {{to direct}} public {{attention away from}} other, harmful business practices. For example, McDonald's Corporation positioned its association with Ronald McDonald House as CSR while its meals {{have been accused of}} promoting poor eating habits.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the chief}} issues with which the {{movement}} for gender-neutral language has <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of gender (sex) specificity in job titles.|$|R
50|$|The common <b>concerns</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> of {{overpopulation}} {{leading to}} resource and energy depletion, soil degradation and environmental destruction, all culminating in agricultural collapse and famine.|$|R
50|$|Metcalfe main <b>concern</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> {{unable to}} account for costs within the workshops, and as main reason he saw the lack of written records.|$|R
25|$|Another {{cause for}} <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{groundwater}} drawdown from over-allocated aquifers {{has the potential}} to cause severe damage to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems – in some cases very conspicuously but in others quite imperceptibly because of the extended period over which the damage occurs.|$|E
25|$|A major <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{irradiation}} {{might cause}} chemical {{changes that are}} harmful to the consumer. Several national expert groups and two international expert groups evaluated the available data and concluded that any food at any dose is wholesome and safe to consume {{as long as it}} remains palatable and maintains its technical properties (e.g. feel, texture, or color).|$|E
25|$|Cherts {{are subject}} to {{problems}} when used as concrete aggregates. Deeply weathered chert develops surface pop-outs when used in concrete that undergoes freezing and thawing {{because of the high}} porosity of weathered chert. The other <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> certain cherts undergo an alkali-silica reaction with high-alkali cements. This reaction leads to cracking and expansion of concrete and ultimately to failure of the material.|$|E

40|$|I. Introduction: Why {{should we}} <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> about {{the labor market}} for middle skill workers? Over the past decade, policymakers and {{employers}} have <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> slower population growth combined with the retirement {{of the baby boom}} generation would lead to a shortage of skilled labor. 1 Even prior to the Great Recession, the <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> an inadequat...|$|R
25|$|A notable <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{despite a}} great deal of rhetoric, there is no real {{consistent}} behavioral theory yet. Behavioral economics scholars also have no unified theory. Until that happens, it is a collection of loosely related or unrelated observations. What is missing is a foundational behavioral theory that can be tested in many domains as a competitor to neoclassical theory.|$|E
25|$|One <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> blastula {{creation}} in SCNT-based human {{stem cell research}} {{will lead to the}} reproductive cloning of humans. Both processes use the same first step: the creation of a nuclear transferred embryo, most likely via SCNT. Those who hold this concern often advocate for strong regulation of SCNT to preclude implantation of any derived products for the intention of human reproduction, or its prohibition.|$|E
25|$|One <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we {{may end up}} with {{thousands}} of vaccines to prevent every virus that can change our cells. Viruses can have different effects on {{different parts of the}} body. It may be possible to prevent a number of different cancers by immunizing against one viral agent. It is likely that HPV, for instance, has a role in cancers of the mucous membranes of the mouth.|$|E
50|$|Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan {{said that}} one of the <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> more Singaporeans <b>are</b> {{infected}} with Dengue Type 3, which is a new strain of the dengue virus.|$|R
30|$|Coulomb’s constant, k = 8.99 × 109 N m 2 C− 2 is {{very small}} and not addressed. The <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> for novice science students, it would be needlessly confusing.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} <b>concerns</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> rivers change their course in 70-100 years and thus once they are linked, future change of course could create huge {{practical}} problems for the project.|$|R
25|$|Another <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{about one}} third of the world's soil-bound carbon is in taiga and tundra areas. When the {{permafrost}} melts, it releases carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and methane, both of which are greenhouse gases. The effect has been observed in Alaska. In the 1970s the tundra was a carbon sink, but today, it is a carbon source. Methane is produced when vegetation decays in lakes and wetlands.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people in}} low-income {{communities}} cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead. Ash or soil {{may be more}} effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap. Evidence quality is poor. One <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it. Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent (alkaline). WHO recommended ash or sand as alternative to soap when soap is not available.|$|E
25|$|Most Sunni Muslims {{believe that}} visual depictions {{of all the}} prophets of Islam should be {{prohibited}} and are particularly averse to visual representations of Muhammad. The key <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the use of images can encourage idolatry. In Shia Islam, however, images of Muhammad are quite common nowadays, even though Shia scholars historically were against such depictions. Still, many Muslims who take a stricter view of the supplemental traditions will sometimes challenge any depiction of Muhammad, including those created and published by non-Muslims.|$|E
50|$|The <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> non-Jews {{would not}} bury their dead in {{established}} cemeteries, but would instead opt for burial at any opportune site -without erecting a fixed and element-proof tombstone marking the burial site.|$|R
50|$|An initial <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{electricity}} {{costs would be}} excessive, since several computers would be operating continuously. Mason figured that a central computer could control the energy consumption {{of all the other}} computers in the house.|$|R
50|$|The FIA's overall <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the cost}} of {{competing}} in motor racing at a level to progress directly to Formula One today <b>is</b> so high <b>that</b> it prevents many talented drivers from having the opportunity to participate.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} {{political}} initiatives in Hedmark to re-establish passenger {{traffic on the}} line. Both the track and stations hold sufficient standard, but a <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> some level crossings may need removing to allow for increased traffic. A 2012 report estimated that passenger services calling at four stations would allow a travel time between Kongsvinger and Elverum of 1 hour and 20 minutes, 35 minutes less than the current bus service. It recommended that the line be electrified and receive centralized traffic control first, which would allow for direct train services onwards to Oslo.|$|E
25|$|Imbrication of the rectus muscles over a nonintegrated implant {{traditionally}} {{was thought}} to impart movement to the implant and prosthesis. Like a ball-and-socket joint, when the implant moves, the prosthesis moves. However, because the so-called ball and socket are separated by layers of Tenon’s capsule, imbricated muscles, and conjunctiva, the mechanical efﬁciency of transmission of movement from the implant to the prosthesis is suboptimal. Moreover, the <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> imbrication of the recti over nonintegrated implants actually can result in implant migration. The recent myoconjuctival technique of enucleation is an alternative to muscle imbrication.|$|E
25|$|Turkle's main {{argument}} {{in the first part}} of the book is that our interactions with robots that simulate emotion pose serious threats to our ability to relate to one another properly. Turkle discusses robots that have been designed to interact with humans on an emotional level; she fears that they may then replace other humans and animals in these emotional roles. Turkle is concerned that we often attribute certain qualities to robots that the robots do not in fact possess, and that our emotional interactions with other humans become eroded as a direct result. Turkle's <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> our appreciation for human interaction may become eroded.|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue of}} <b>concern,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> claims for adverse {{possession}} ('squatters' rights') {{of the land}} (which would have been numerous), would have gained more validity (and become practically impossible to fight) had an abandonment order been made.|$|R
50|$|The <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> key protections {{to privacy}} had been eroded away with {{technological}} advancements, therefore needed robust support {{in some areas}} to raise international human rights to the standards which had developed in the pre-digital age.|$|R
