2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{centrifugal}} forces encountered during drifting, drivers are usually retained by a racing seat and five-point harness. This allows the hands to merely turn the wheel, instead of bracing {{the body in the}} seat. The same applies for the feet, which are free to move rapidly between <b>clutch,</b> <b>brake</b> and accelerator pedals. The steering wheel is usually relatively small, dished, and perfectly round, {{so that it can be}} released and allowed to spin through the hands as the caster returns the front wheels to center. The locking knob on the hand brake is usually replaced with a spin turn knob; this stops the hand brake locking on when pulled. Nearly all drivers move the hand brake location or add an extra hydraulic hand brake actuator for greater braking force. Additional gauges used to monitor boost levels, oil pressure and temperature, intake and coolant temperatures, air-fuel ratio (also called λ, or [...] "lambda" [...] ratio), etc. Some drivers, especially in larger cars, move the seating position for a better weight distribution, such as Daigo Saito's 2014 JZX100 Mk.II Chaser.|$|E

25|$|Differential <b>braking</b> {{actually}} predates <b>clutch</b> <b>braking</b> on tracked vehicles, {{having been}} initially introduced by Richard Hornsby & Sons in 1905 on the world's first tracked vehicle. <b>Clutch</b> <b>braking</b> became popular {{only because of}} its mechanical simplicity. Differential braking could be found on many smaller tanks, especially in the pre-World War II era. British tanks began using them during World War I, and continued into World War II. One common example was the Bren Carrier.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{any other}} type of transmission, {{non-synchronous}} transmissions often have a mechanism for slowing down, or stopping an idle gear. In commercial motor vehicles, this mechanism is called the <b>clutch</b> <b>brake,</b> and is used by depressing the clutch {{all the way to the}} floor, or pressing a button on the top of the gear lever. This is useful in 18-wheelers that have just started their diesel engines, and are releasing parking locks, and engaging the transmission from a stop. The <b>clutch</b> <b>brake</b> not only slows or stops the idle gear axis, but can also prevent shifting into gear until the clutch pedal is released a few inches off the floor. In order to shift into gear, the clutch must be half way off the floor, otherwise the <b>clutch</b> <b>brake</b> will prevent the transmission from being shifted into or out of gear. Mechanics must often repair or replace the <b>clutch</b> <b>brake</b> in a non-synchronous transmission when an inexperienced operator wears it out, it becomes inoperable, or has lost its function.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clutch</b> <b>braking</b> was {{introduced}} by the French in 1916 during World War I. Most light tanks used it through the 1920s and 30, {{as well as some}} larger tanks like the Vickers Independent and Soviet T-35. The last major designs to use it were the Soviet T-34 and German Panzer III and Panzer IV.|$|R
40|$|DD 138168 A UPAB: 19940205 The monitor is for <b>clutches</b> and <b>brakes</b> of {{separately}} located systems; esp. single disc <b>clutches</b> and <b>brakes</b> on presses and shears. The {{switch points}} of the systems are determined by control of their actuators, while the contact points {{are determined by the}} switch points, friction forces, in the actuators, and the actuating path. The friction disc (6, 7) of the <b>clutch</b> (1) and <b>brake</b> (2) have facing pairs of transmitters. An additional pair of transmitters is positioned in each friction disc, located at a rotational angle, on the same radius. The transmitters of one pair are connected via an AND-gate (10 - 13) to an evaluation circuit. Both pairs of <b>clutch</b> and <b>brake</b> transmitters are each connected to the circuit via an OR-gate (14, 18) ...|$|R
50|$|Another major type {{of smart}} fluid are electrorheological or ER fluids, whose {{resistance}} to flow can be quickly and dramatically altered by an applied electric field (note, the yield stress point is altered rather than the viscosity). Besides fast acting <b>clutches,</b> <b>brakes,</b> shock absorbers and hydraulic valves, other, more esoteric, applications such as bulletproof vests have been proposed for these fluids.|$|R

50|$|Another {{difference}} between semi-trucks and cars {{is the way}} the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is double clutching required, but a <b>clutch</b> <b>brake</b> is required as well. The <b>clutch</b> <b>brake</b> stops the rotation of the gears, and allows the truck to be put into gear without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes.|$|E

50|$|Electromagnetic <b>clutches</b> and <b>brakes</b> operate electrically, but {{transmit}} torque mechanically. This is {{why they}} used to be referred to as electro-mechanical <b>clutches</b> or <b>brakes.</b> Over the years, EM became known as electromagnetic versus electro mechanical, referring more about their actuation method versus physical operation. Since the clutches started becoming popular over 60 years ago, the variety of applications and <b>brake</b> and <b>clutch</b> designs has increased dramatically, but the basic operation remains the same.|$|R
5000|$|As with E-Type {{the player}} {{took control of}} the car using the mouse. The three Acorn mouse buttons {{represent}} (from left) the <b>Clutch,</b> <b>Brake</b> and Accelerator. This adds to the [...] "realism" [...] of the game as this corresponds to the typical layout of the car's foot pedals. Keyboard keys were used for gear changes (in Manual or Electronic gearbox mode).|$|E
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to make rear-wheel drive burnouts easier by installing [...] "line locks", devices which allow fluid pressure on the front brakes to be maintained while releasing the pedal to free the rear brakes. This is especially useful in a manual transmission vehicle, in which it can be quite difficult to manipulate the <b>clutch,</b> <b>brake</b> and gas pedals simultaneously. Line locks also reduce wear to the rear brakes, a common problem otherwise.|$|E
50|$|Although {{based on}} the 3 Litre's engine, the 6½ engine {{incorporated}} many improvements. The 3 Litre's cone-type clutch {{was replaced by a}} dry-plate design that incorporated a <b>clutch</b> <b>brake</b> for fast gear changes, and the car had power-assisted four-wheel brakes with finned drums. The front brakes had 4 leading shoes per drum. By operating a patented compensating device, the driver could adjust all four brakes to correct for wear while the car was moving, which was particularly advantageous during races.|$|E

50|$|Some {{applications}} require {{very tight}} precision between all components. In these applications, even 1° of movement between the input and the output when a coupling is engaged {{can be a}} problem. This is true in many robotic applications. Sometimes the design engineers will order <b>clutches</b> or <b>brakes</b> with zero backlash but then key them to the shafts so although the <b>clutch</b> or <b>brake</b> will have zero backlash there’s still minimal movement occurring between the hub or rotor in the shaft.|$|R
50|$|The Cadillac Type 53 was {{the first}} car {{to use the same}} control layout as modern automobiles- with the gear lever and hand brake {{in the middle of the}} front two seats, a key started ignition, and three pedals for the <b>clutch,</b> <b>brake</b> and {{throttle}} in the modern order. This Cadillac was driven by a 77 horse power V8 engine. The Type 53 remained in production for one year only, in 1916. When this car debuted in 1916 it succeeded the Cadillac Type 51. The following year the Cadillac Type 55 replaced the Type 53. It was built at the Cass Street and Amsterdam Avenue factory in Detroit, with the body provided by a number of coachbuilders, including Fleetwood Metal Body in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5000|$|For example, people {{learning}} to drive manual transmission might {{first have to}} demonstrate their mastery of [...] "rules of the road", safety, defensive driving, parallel parking etc. Then they may focus on two independent competencies: [...] "using the <b>clutch,</b> <b>brake</b> with right foot" [...] and [...] "shifting up and down through the gears". Once the learners have demonstrated they are comfortable with those two skills the next, overarching skill might be [...] "finding first: from full stop to a slow roll" [...] followed by [...] "sudden stops", [...] "shifting up" [...] and [...] "down shifting". Because this is kinetic learning the instructor likely would demonstrate the individual skill a few times then the student would perform guided practice followed by independent practice until they can demonstrate their mastery.|$|E

50|$|Instrumentation {{included}} a centrally mounted speedometer, {{the fuel level}} and the oil pressure. A third dial directly below the driver's sight line was a clock, unusually on this size of car. The three floor pedals followed the pattern still 'conventional' for a manual transmission car (<b>clutch,</b> <b>brake,</b> gas) but {{to the left of}} the clutch pedal was a small foot operated dipper switch for the headlights. Control knobs lined up along the base of the fascia {{included a}} hand throttle.Early Italian images of Ardea interiors confirm that Lancias of the period were still right hand drive, a position elsewhere taken to imply driving on the left side of the road. However, right-hand drive is practical even where drivers drive on the right-hand side of the road as it allows a better view of the edge of the road, which is useful when driving on rough roads in mountainous districts. This did mean that drivers of cars with centrally located floor mounted gear shifts, such as the Ardea, needed to learn how to shift with the left hand. During the 1920s Italian leader Benito Mussolini required all Italian drivers to drive on the right, but Lancia would continue, through the 1950s, to supply right hand drive cars in areas viewed by other automakers as left hand drive markets.|$|E
